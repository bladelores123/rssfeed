<p>
	Time is purely a function of your current state of consciousness. If your state changes enough, time will cease to exist.

			yeah those ones. Just speaking within story terms, watching a home video is at least a more unified "sequence of events" than two people trying to recount the same story from memory.  It appears to stay the same whether I show the home video to no one, or to hundreds, quite unlike telling a story with words.  Maybe this has nothing to do with time but do you have any thing to say about it? Maybe I'm asking more about recording vs recounting.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well... your consciousness and mind is going through a very complex and elaborate process to link up those images on the recording to your entire view of reality and your mind is positioning those images within a certain mental framework which you call time and your personal story.
</p>

<p>
	This mental process is so sophisticated and complex that it's basically impossible to map out in a logical linear sequence.

<p>
	Well, there's many layers of reasons why not.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in theory it would be nice, but in practice we are all too selfish to sustain it. That would require massive degrees of consciousness, selflessness, and love, which less than 0.0001% of people are currently capable of.

<p>
	Not nearly deep enough.

<p>

<p>
	We are rapidly raising our collective consciousness when looked at in the geological time scale. But you are looking at this from the tiny time scale of your one personal life. That's why it seems like it will take forever. But in a few thousand years we might be really close to that ideal. A few thousand years is like a microsecond in God's mind.

<p>
	Imagination IS reality.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is however you imagine it is. So if you imagine definite timelines of the entire universe, that's what you create. And if you say you didn't create it, but that it was there before you came along, then that's what you imagine/create.
</p>

<p>
	The key is to understand that YOU ARE FUCKING DOING IT!

</blockquote>

<p>
	You don't have to be all that stuff. That stuff is for guys who want HOT girls.
</p>

<p>
	If you want an ordinary, below-average girl, you can get away with not working on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But this forum is fundamentally about becoming the best that you can be. So we are biased in that way. We want more than the average guy here.
</p>

<p>
	But also, becoming good with women and becoming a high-value guy IS just you being you. Assuming you want to be a high-value guy. If you want to be a lazy guy, then do that. In which case why are you reading about dating advice? Dating advice already assumes you want to improve yourself somehow to get a better result.
</p>

<p>
	If you care about attracting high quality women, you must offer her something in return. Otherwise you're basically trying to cheat her.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the real key to pickup is that it's not about tricking a hot girl to sleep with a lame guy. It's about turning a lame guy into a powerful man, and then girls crave that new guy you have become. In this way you aren't cheating the girl, you are actually transforming yourself for her. You are giving her the gift of the best possible you!
</p>

<p>
	All the fucking work I did on myself, I can now happily gift to a woman for her enjoyment. And that is ultimately the greatest joy of the pickup journey: the joy that women get from who you have become. It's like giving a homeless person a million dollars and seeing the smile on his face.
</p>

<p>
	The average guy gifts his girlfriend a turd.
</p>

<p>
	A guy who works on himself gifts his girlfriend the sparkling diamond which he has become.
</p>

<p>
	Your girlfriend doesn't want a diamond around her finger, she wants a diamond between her legs. She wants you to be her diamond.
</p>

<p>
	And how are diamonds made? Under great pressure. The pressure of life experience forges a weak boy into a powerful man. And it is this purification process which you hate when you say, "I hate this".
</p>

<p>
	Of course it will massively grow your self-esteem and confidence. Especially in the context of women.
</p>

<p>
	But of course it will not fix all your self-esteem issues automatically. There are many dimensions to self-esteem and confidence which pickup will not touch.

</p>

<p>
	<strong><span style="font-size:72px;">NO.</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	We are not gonna get into the inferiority of race debates on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	If you think some races are fundamentally inferior, this forum is not for you.
</p>

<p>
	Let's try to elevate the quality of our conversations here. Is debating the inferiority of black people a good use of your time?

ALL OF IT! That's ego surviving. There's nothing true about it. It's grounded in selfishness and self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	So what you're defending is ego. All politics is survival and pure fiction.

	What can government do to crub teenage pregnancy??? Nothing? Really??? He doesn't know?
</p>

<p>
	Sex ed, free condoms, birth control
</p>

<p>
	This is the lack of systems thinking and collective responsibility that I was talking about.
</p>

<p>
	And actually, government plays a huge role in making people "virtuous". That is the whole point. Good government can enable the development of virtuous citizens.
</p>

<p>
	Government's not good at doing things? Government does the most difficult task in the world, managing a powerful military. If government can do that, it can do a lot of other stuff effectively. The problem is that people like Rand Paul defund government at every corner so of course it can't be good at doing things then.

<p>
	So... I've gotten some pushback from libertartians that I am strawmanning their arguments. Of course we don't want that. So let's see some real-life self-proclaimed libertarians arguing for their ideology and their policy proposals.
</p>

<p>
	Post video examples here so people can get a true sense of how libertarians think and how my critiques of libertarianism applies to their logic.
</p>

<p>
	Then people can judge for themselves if libertarianism holds any water.
</p>

<p>
	You see... one of the things I made sure to do in my Libertarianism critique is to focus on libertarianism <u>as it functions in the real world</u>, not as it is written about in academic books. What I have found is that while libertarianism may sound reasonable in an academic book, when it is practiced by real people in the real world, it looks far less flattering. That's what you'd expect from an ideology which is highly idealistic and philosophical. The philosophy can look good on paper, but then when you use it to build an actual real-world thing, it turns to shit. Similar to what happened with Communism in the Soviet era. It sounded a lot better on paper than it turned out in practice.
</p>

<p>
	But there's far more to it than that. Even if he works out his fears, thoughts, emotions, etc. It still won't be good enough.
</p>

<p>
	He needs a radical shift in his state of consciousness. Which is either created through: Intense concentration on the NOW, or taking a chemical.
</p>

<p>
	Either way, chemical changes are happening.

	You can think of Consciousness like one of those Transitions Glasses lenses which turns dark when sun shines on it, and turns clear when you go indoors. It's the same lens and it's always NOW, but the question is, is it transparent or opaque? If it's opaque, then you ain't awake, and nothing an awake person says will make sense.

<p>
	No, he just has game and you don't. That's the key difference.
</p>

<p>
	The deceptive part is that when you see really good pickup in action, it doesn't look like pickup. It looks totally natural, such that an on-looker would say, "But that's not pickup, that's just a cool guy being friendly." Exactly! But you have no idea what work is involved in becoming that good. On-lookers will only judge you by the end result. They don't know how many hundreds of sets you bombed with cringe to get to this set.

	It's a function of one's state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You are in the wrong state.
</p>

<p>
	All states happen NOW, but you need the right state. So if you're in the wrong state, NOW won't feel like anything special.

<p>
	EVERY newbie makes this mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Attracting females is deeply counter-inutitive. The less you care about them, the more attracted they will get to you.
</p>

<p>
	You can treat her like your dirty, braty sister. Tell her, "If you don't behave, I'm gonna spank you like you're my dirty little sister."
</p>

<p>
	Don't let women boss you around. You have to lead them.
</p>

<p>
	The frame must be that you are more valuable than her. Then she will crave you. Women do not crave weak, low-value males.

<p>
	Basically yes. The hotter the woman, the more true it will be.
</p>

<p>
	The less hot the woman the less value you need to offer as a man to get her.

<p>
	It's an implicit value trade. A sexual auctionhouse.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect women to be able to honestly articulate what she wants in a man. It's all deeply subconscious. She will tell you all sorts of nonsense like, "I want a nice guy." This cannot be trusted. What she logically wants is irrelevant. What matters is what will make her sleep with you.

It was so vicious, we got so beat up on by pirates that we quit the game in frustration. My brother was even scammed for $100 and all his in-game money.
</p>

<p>
	Which perfectly explains why no one wants to live in libertarianland. The bullies dominate everyone else because there is no referee. EVE is a game full of scammers and trolls. In real life such people would rape your children in front of you for sport.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why EVE never went mainstream. It can only exist as a niche game for the most hardcore people.

<p>
	Because on Tinder the women are there shopping for partners/guys, and THE ONLY THING they have to judge you on is your picture. So of course, when framed like that, every woman will choose the hottest looking guy.
</p>

<p>
	By placing yourself like a piece of meat on Tinder, you lose 95% of your value unless you are in the top 10% of physically attractive guys. So the cost of you being lazy is losing 95% of your value. That's what you get for being lazy.
</p>

<p>
	If you approach women in the real world, the entire dynamic changes.

</p>

<p>
	Sounds to me like you are texting them in needy ways, since you are needy and inexperienced, and they smell that neediness off you a mile away.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing repels women faster than neediness.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to start going out and learning to build attraction with women face to face. This requires practice. If a woman is really attracted to you, she will not only text back eagerly, within minutes, but she will give you all sorts of compliments to make sure you understand that she want to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	If you fail to attract her, she will be very cold via text. Basically non-responsive. If a girl is non-response or cold via text, that her telling you: I have no interest in you.
</p>

<p>
	Women don't have it easy. Actually guys have it easier because we have the ability to go out make ourselves much more attractive via pickup. Women do not have this option.
</p>

<p>
	You make the mistake of confusing your reproductive agenda with a woman's. Women have a totally different reproductive agenda than men. Pure physical sex is of little value to a woman. That's not what the woman needs. So just because she can easily get it with some random dude is of little help to her.
</p>

<p>
	ATTRACTION CANNOT BE BUILT VIA TEXT! << Burn this into your skull. You must build attraction in-person. Texting is merely a mechanism to set up a date, assuming you have attraction. You cannot compensate for lack of attraction with clever text game. It will not work.
</p>

<p>
	The solution here is simple: channel your frustration into going out and socializing with new girls face to face.
</p>

<p>
	Stop expecting texts to get you laid. They will not.
</p>

Maybe go date more to discover what you like and what you don't. The first few girls it's hard to tell.

			That's not why people are calling him a cult leader, though. This is different.<br />
			<br />
			Again, from his own Wikipedia entry. . .<br />
			<br />
			"It was reported that, of the estimated 50,000 users of the website, about 20 (0.04%) FDR members had also disassociated from their families-of-origin, and that many parents chose not to speak to the media in an effort to avoid alienating their children further. The British Cult Information Centre (CIC) has described Freedomain Radio as a cult. A representative of the CIC said they were following FDR, and said that one sign of cults was that they cut people off from their families. Molyneux responded by saying, "If I advised a wife to leave an abusive husband, there would not be articles about how I am a cult leader"."

<p>
	Cult is not a binary. It's a matter of degree. There are dozens of factors that go into making a proper cult. One red flag does not a cult make.
</p>

<p>
	You could call it "cultish" if you want to be more accurate.
</p>

<p>
	I explain all this in my 2 part series, Cult Psychology.

			What a monopoly has to be is... monopolistic. I agree it doesn't need to be perfect but it still needs to be overwhelming in practice whenever the monopoly is challenged. Even as far as intent was concerned, one of these laws was the 2nd amendment which was explicitly aimed to prevent such a monopoly.
		</p>

		<p>
			A true federation has no monopoly of force. The EU for instance also has laws, courts, agencies and a legislature. It doesn't need overwhelming military force because members are allowed to secede.
		</p>

		<p>
			Please keep in mind that in the context of this thread I'm trying to argue the mainstream anarchist (or federalist) position and not the individualist position which I loathe. No doubt I'm doing a poor job of it, not being an anarchist myself. But I'm not trying to say you don't need a monopoly at some level but rather that the monopoly need not be in the hands of a state (which necessarily has little in the way of accountability to its subjects).

<p>
	These are some nuances which are beyond the scope of what I was talking about in the video.
</p>

<p>
	The more evolved a society gets the less it will need to rely on brute physical force to enforce its laws and rules. Most US laws do not require brute physical enforcement these days.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe in the far distant future there won't need to be a military at all. But not in our lifetimes so I don't really care about that.

			I think the first phase of the war belies quite eloquently the notion that the early USA had a monopoly of force over its territory. You talked about kings and so forth earlier but other non-monarchical polities in history had a similar makeup: common defense against outsiders but no monopoly of force internally.

<p>
	A monopoly of force does not have to be perfect or absolute. Of course in the early days of the US things were somewhat loose. But still there were laws, courts, legislature, police, military, government agencies, etc.

<p>
	Not true at all. Monopoly of force was established from the very beginning. It was used to defend against foreign powers and conquer the Native Americans.
</p>

<p>
	The Civil War was simply a fracture in the monopoly and it only lasted for like 5 years.

<p>
	Molynuex actually has high integrity because he doesn't run ads. So him asking for donations is totally fair. I see no problem with that. A donations based model for funding one's work/channel is admirable.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The fundamental answer is: because when you see how horrific and ugly it is for long enough, you will want to end it.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever consciousness looks at its own selfishness and ugliness long enough, it awakens, has a change of heart, and drops the selfishness in favor or selflessness and love.
</p>

<p>
	Even if the North had not invaded the South. Eventually even the South itself would recognize that their slavery was too ugly and selfish to be sustained. It would have just taken a few hundred years longer.

<p>
	Yeah, that's how most libertarians argue because they are stage Orange, which tends to get comically "rational" when it is threatened. The entire stage Orange worldview is grounded in a religious-like faith in logic, without realizing that logic can be misused by the ego-mind to justify any sort of nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	Every deluded ideologue in the world feels that his worldview is logical. Case in point: Ben Shapiro.
</p>

<p>
	Logic cannot ever be trusted to understand the nuances of reality.

<p>
	I don't think he's a cult leader.
</p>

<p>
	As I said in my Cult Psychology - Part 2 video, there are many cult-like dynamics in society and online which do not make for a true cult. Although they are still problematic.
</p>

<p>
	People call me a cult leader all the time. It's all too easy to call someone whose worldview you disagree with a cult leader.

			I haven't seen Star Trek but this doesn't sound like the path we're on. For a little while during the collapse of the USSR it seemed (if you looked away from China and France) that the USA was gaining global supremacy but it has since lost ground and no other state and come anywhere near that amount of power since. Some of the supranationals (the UN, the EU and so forth) have grown pver the past decades but none has significant military force. They have a different kind of force which has grown more important over the decades. If a global state ever forms along those lines, it won't have a monopoly of force. And it won't need to.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Ah... okay, fair point.
</p>

<p>
	So what I mean is NOT that one nation will become so powerful as to physically dominate all the others into one global empire. No! That cannot happen because we are too developmentally evolved as a species for that.
</p>

<p>
	Global unification will happen along the lines of how the 13 colonies became the United States. There was no bloody war to force the colonies to unify. They did it peacefully and willingly.
</p>

<p>
	So what will happen is that all the countries of the world will start to unify through a natural desire to do so rather than through domination. It will so be obvious that having a unified world government will be a net gain for all parities who join as it will bring great cohesion and peace and prosperity.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is if there is an alien invasion. This will force nations to unify in self-defense. But I think most aliens are going to be far too conscious and selfless to invade us. An advanced alien species who can build fast ships will have to be extremely conscious and loving and shouldn't even has a desire to harm us.

<p>
	I see your question. Okay, yeah, in that case you need to factor in development psychology and the moral developmental line. Yes, as people become more educated and conscious thanks to the order and peace and technology afforded by the unification under monopoly of force, eventually they develop a higher sense of love and selflessness, which then leads to things like abolition of slavery, women's rights, civil rights, gay rights, police reform, etc.

	I find him sincere.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see why you must call him a failed philosopher or insincere. You simply have a different worldview than his.
</p>

<p>
	His show was about as successful as you could expect it to be and it seems like he earned his success through hard work on his show. Why begrudge him for that?

			So say in the beginning a group of friends created a gang/syndicate to oppress the people around them. Now they have monopoly of force in that community, and a hierarchy. Basically a tribe. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Now the question is why would they give up that “privileged” position in the hierarchy? Because we see all societies democratize overtime.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, just look at how it worked historically. The history books tell us what happened.
</p>

<p>
	Kings unified warring tribes. People accepted it because as bad as a king might be, warring tribes are worse. But once all the tribes are unified under one banner and culture for some centuries, people start to wonder why they need a king. Why can't they rule themselves as one unified nation? The king also usually becomes corrupt with power by this point. And so they stage a revolution to overthrow the king and put in place some kind of legislature and constitution which distributes the power to more than one person at the top. Voting rights are eventually established. Then voting rights get expanded to more and more ordinary people, not just aristocrats.
</p>

<p>
	Of course kings, aristocrats, and elites never give up their power willingly. They must be forced into to.
</p>

<p>
	Look at the police protests right now. The police are not willing to give up their power, but the mob of people is stronger than them and will take away some of the police's power because the police have been using their power recklessly.

<p>
	Find out what your top 2 love languages are and what her's are, and start using her love languages to give her the love she wants. And she will do the same for you.
</p>

<p>
	See book: The 5 Love Languages
</p>

<p>
	Both of you should read the book and discuss it.
</p>

<p>
	You are the man! You should be leading her towards what you want this relationship to be. If you want her to love you more, then it is your responsibility to communicate that to her and teach her how to love you.

	If you talk to 2000 girls, at least a few of them will turn really bad. The girl could be having a terrible day or she just gets spooked. She could be drunk. Her husband or boyfriend could get very defensive. etc.

	It's hard to nail jello to the wall.

<p>
	BTW, the European refugee immigration issue is a legitimate one. You can certainly make a valid point that a society can only integrate so many people from less developed countries. But this point needs to be made very carefully, based on science, not based on nationalism and ethnocentrism. If you want to limit the number of immigrants to a country, that's a legit discussion we could have. You will need to provide some studies/proof which shows that your country cannot accommodate more immigrants.

<p>
	Nah... You can broadcast sexual intent early on. Just don't make it explicit. It's subtle.
</p>

<p>
	I often broadcast sexual intent with physical touch super early on. The way I touch her, she knows this isn't patty-cakes. Physical touch is HUGE!

	You will become that carefree cool guy.
</p>

<p>
	Girls aren't attracted to some one stereotype. They are attracted to fun cool guys, period. It doesn't matter if you will sleep with her one night or marry her. Her attraction to you will be the same in both cases.

<p>
	And I enjoy long-term relationships with the right girl. I'm not really big on one night stands.
</p>

<p>
	You can find girls who are into either one.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a deep topic. Like I said, you should be careful and responsible not to hurt girls too much. Obviously don't mislead them about your intentions.
</p>

<p>
	At a nightclub, one night stands are so common that the issue of a long-term relationship won't even come up in many cases since both of you know it was just a casual fling. But if you start seeing her repeatedly, yeah, she will start to expect a relationship, in which case you gotta be clear with her about what you want.
</p>

<p>
	I suggest you don't see a girl repeatedly unless you really like her and are willing to commit.
</p>

			What the line between that and being just a part of her entertainment of the night? Cause yeah sometimes they laugh even a lot but that doesn't mean that they are willing to sleep with you, they might just find you a funny guy, kind of like a dancing monkey. So how do you avoid that?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Easy. That's avoided with strong sexual intent and man-woman interaction. You need to be staring her down like a juicy piece of meat. She will feel that off you. This is not a friendly social conversation. She must feel within the first 2 minutes that if you get her alone in a room, you're going to fuck her. You need to broadcast sexual intent without ever saying anything sexual.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you could say within the first 2 minutes: "OMG, you are so yummy. I could bite into you like a juicy piece of watermelon." Then immediately switch to another topic without waiting for her response. After you say that, she will clearly know you aren't playing patty-cakes.
</p>

<p>
	But the best thing is just look her in the eyes like you want to fuck her. She will know. Nothing needs to be said.
</p>

<p>
	There are so many subtle ways to broadcast sexual intent.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with that one. It's a bit too edgy.
</p>

<p>
	Dial the edge down to a manageable point. You can say something like, "You are adorable like a little pig." It's a nice backhanded compliment because no girl wants to be called a pig. But if she gets offended you can always insist, "But baby pigs are so cute! Why do you hate piglets? Are you racist?"
</p>

<p>
	By that point you will have totally scrambled her mind. You can then switch to a serious topic.
</p>

<p>
	It's not lies per se. It's just being playful. DO NOT BE SERIOUS when talking to girls. Everything is a joke. Nothing matters. That's the proper attitude. You invest no emotional attachment in the interaction until she shows serious interest.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, making her laugh and making yourself laugh is the key. If you can make a girl laugh consistently she will get attracted to you very fast.
</p>

<p>
	A great way to go about this is to flip your love inside out.
</p>

<p>
	So, instead of saying "I love you", say "I hate you :)"
</p>

<p>
	"I hate you" is a great opener.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than saying, "will you marry me today?" it's much better to say, "I will never marry you. I will just use you and throw you away."
</p>

<p>
	I mean... you can make any line work in theory. But generally you don't want to come off as needy or desperate for love or sex.
</p>

<p>
	One time I slept with a girl after grabbing her while she was walking by and telling her, "I'm looking for a wife." She looked at me and said, "I'm looking for a husband." Bam! Instant green-light! 5 minutes later we were making out. 15 minutes later I pulled her to the hotel bathroom for sex but security kicked us out. 30 minutes later we were driving to her hotel room for sex.
</p>

<p>
	Again, what matters is not the words in your line, it's how your delivering it and how you follow up.
</p>

<p>
	You can open with almost any dumb line as long as it isn't instantly creepy or sexual.
</p>

<p>
	The dumbest openers work, like, "You will be my Pokemon." Usually the dumber you are, the more girls love it. Be dumb, but not creepy or sexual.
</p>

	How exactly does Penguinz0 imagine pickup works? You walk to up any random woman and she falls in love with you?
</p>

<p>
	In pickup you get blown out so much. Most of your sets go nowhere. But if you do 20 sets in a day, a few of them will hook hard. Getting blown out of sets is actually very important as it shows you're putting yourself on the line and it builds your confidence and ability to handle rejection.
</p>

It's an instant turn off for girls. It makes you look far too desperate and creepy.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, it's easy to record flashy and edgy pickup videos. But that does not equate to good game because in real life it's far too strong and scares the girls away. You want to be more chill and normal.
</p>

<p>
	Do not talk about sex with her unless she's already attracted to you and you're close to having sex with her. And even then you should avoid it since it's too explicit and will make her feel like a cheap slut. Guys love sexual humor, women usually don't.
</p>

<p>
	Licking ice cream off her ass? LOL
</p>

<p>
	Free head?? LOL
</p>

<p>
	You will after I cum on it? LOL. Cringe!
</p>

<p>
	You wanna see a freak show, my devil-head penis. LOL. OMG this fucking guy.
</p>

<p>
	That's shit game. This is scaring off all the girls.

<title>Is The Latest Video About Libertarianism or Anarchism?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/51091-is-the-latest-video-about-libertarianism-or-anarchism/?do=findComment&amp;comment=660047</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	My examples were deliberately extreme to highlight the absurdity of people who argue for "freedom". But there is an enormous range of people who argue for it. Some people may be total anarchists while others might be pro military and even pro taxes, but still complain about things like regulation of car pollution or regulation of wild salmon fisheries in Alaska.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter what size gov you're okay with because all sizes of government are relative. So even if some libertarian says that he is okay with some federal government, all my points from the video still apply to him. Because he will still be arguing for deregulation on the grounds that bureaucracy infringes on his personal freedoms.
</p>

<p>
	A libertarian is one who complains about government regulation regardless of how big or small his government happens to be. He always feels oppressed and inconvenienced because he fundamentally doesn't understand the necessities of government.
</p>

<p>
	I should have made this more clear in the video, since libertarians who are somewhat okay with federal government will now use this as an excuse to ignore all my points -- which still all apply to them.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, dummy.
</p>

<p>
	Girls will never call a guy cute unless they are attracted.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to tell if she's attracted is by how attentive she is when you talk, how willing she is to follow your lead, and how willing she is to hold deep eye contact. If she's looking deep in your eyes, she's willing to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	Also, if she's willing to let you touch her body, she's willing to sleep with you.

	It's overly selfish and emphasizes one night stands too much. It also tends to be highly misogynistic and needlessly cruel.

<p>
	RSD is about becoming as natural as you can. The problem is how to become natural when you aren't one to begin with?
</p>

<p>
	True naturals tend to be highly extroverted, charismatic, social, confident, and experienced from a very young age. So you can't get that without doing thousand of clumsy approaches. Natural is the end result of years of nonstop effort and mastery. It will all feel highly unnatural when you start. Don't let that stop you. Naturalness comes with experience and skill.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, you will still require at least a year or two to get decent. There's more to it than mere confidence. You have to learn how to deal with all the obstacles that girls will throw in your face as you try to pull them home. You will lose hundreds of girls due to small mistakes you make. It's impossible to be born into life just knowing how to navigate all these obstacles. This is a skill that must be cultivated through practice and experience.

	Obama's demeanor was actually a good feel of Yellow. He was chill, neutral, moderate, openminded, a deep thinker, professorial, non-dogmatic, willing to negotiate with the other side, etc.
</p>

<p>
	In practice his politics wasn't so progressive, but his demeanor was Yellowish.

	I like how the stupidity of one buffoon (Trump) flushes out the stupidity of a second (Kanye), which flushes out a third (Musk).
</p>

<p>
	It's like the stupidity which used to be locked away for fear of embarrassment is now flaunted in public with pride. Showing us exactly who these people are.
</p>

<p>
	Birds of a narcissistic feather flock together.

<p>
	Don't. Just do pickup when you're doing pickup, and do meditation when you sit to meditate.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			I have been doing pickup for about 1 year. Due to covid i have not been able to do it for about 4 months though. I am getting good. Can get numbers and dates, but i am very short guy 5'2". I want to improve my game. So, provide me some suggestion. Especially on using meditation on the field.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	If you can get numbers and dates, clearly you're getting attraction, so what are you insecure about? As far as your insecurity goes, what you need to get through your thick skull is this: within about 15 minutes you will either reach hook-point with a girl or not. If you reach hook-point, you will clearly see that she's attracted. Once you see that, you know she is willing to fuck you if you just don't screw it up from here on out and handle the logistics well. So drop any insecurity from here. You KNOW she's willing to fuck you. And if a girl agrees to go on a date with you: YOU KNOW SHE'S WILLING TO FUCK YOU. A girl will never agree to go on a date with a guy she's not willing to fuck.
</p>

<p>
	Your insecurity should be about those initial 15 minutes to reach hook-point. If you get there, you've won! She's willing to fuck you. Which means your looks are now irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	One of the best guys I knew in game was a short 5'2" Pakistani guy. He was amazing. He got more girls than me at 6'2".
</p>

<p>
	Your PERSONALITY is what matters. Focus on improving that. Become charming and bold and you will attract many girls.
</p>

<p>
	YES! Of-fucking-course you are. We all are. I was hugely insecure about my looks. I didn't believe I could ever attract a hot girl. When I first started it seemed impossible, like a fantasy.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It certainly plays a role, but most guys seriously overestimate its importance. You will be shocked how hot of girls you will attract if you approach enough.
</p>

<p>
	One of the coolest things I learned is that I can attract the hottest girl in the club. You can attract porn star hotness level girls. Because girls are primarily attracted to strong personality, not looks.
</p>

<p>
	If you have above average looks, that certainly helps. It will be easier.

<p>
	That's enough get to hot girls.
</p>

<p>
	Girls don't judge your looks as much as you judge theirs. See? That's your problem. You're projecting.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can get very technical about game.
</p>

<p>
	But that's not good for newbies. When you're just starting out you want to focus on the bare basics like your dress, grooming, approaching consistently, building decent state, eye contact, smiling, body posture, physical escalation, never running out of things to say, and leading.
</p>

<p>
	The most important things are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Going out at least 2x-3x nights a week, consistently
	</li>
	<li>
		Approaching consistently
	</li>
	<li>
		Putting yourself into a good mood while you do so
	</li>
	<li>
		Smiling and laser eye contact
	</li>
	<li>
		Getting good at never running out of things to say. Becoming good at holding conversation
	</li>
	<li>
		Communicating with her man-to-woman, with clear sexual intent
	</li>
	<li>
		Immediate physical escalation
	</li>
	<li>
		Leading her
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That will get you 90% of your results. Getting decent at all the above will take you several years of full time work.
</p>

And one more question, every time I decide to go to that direction and learn more about attraction and girls practically, I tend to stop and postpone because I think that I'm just not good enough and if I fixed this thing here and that thing there, then I will be ready to go and do it.

	Yeah, of course. Getting over your own excuses, fears, and insecurity is like 70% of getting good with girls. That's the hardest part.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, just do it. But you need a strong vision of why you're doing it and what you hope to get out of it. Otherwise there's no way you'll be motivated enough to push through the hard times.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you have serious life problems holding you back, it's nice to solve those. Although you can find ways to do pickup without spending any money.
</p>

<p>
	At the very least you can go out twice a week on Fri and Sat. You can work and still do pickup at night or weekends.
</p>

<p>
	All of them are valuable. Tyler's are great of course. You gotta sort through it all and see which ones resonate with you.
</p>

<p>
	When I started pickup I had a giant torrent of like every possible pickup teaching in the last 20 years. I studied the shit out of it for 100s of hours. I studied it harder than I studied calculus in college, LOL. And that was before RSD's best free YT material was fully released. That was like 8 years ago now.
</p>

<p>
	God, I'm getting old.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of great new pickup material has been released since then. I started out studying Mystery Method, LOL. I studied like 20 different teachers and coaches. All of it was useful, but RSD I liked the most because it was so brutally realistic and down-to-earth. I don't like fluff in my dating teachings.

<p>
	I started at 26-27 in that position. I had a lot to learn.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, at that age you want to get started right away. It will get harder and harder the older you get. 24-25 is the perfect age to get into pickup. Although Covid-19 obviously killed it for the next year.

<p>
	Street and day game is my fave. It works even better since there's almost zero competition.
</p>

<p>
	One of the best things I got from my 2000 approaches is that these days if I see a cute girl at Wholefoods, I can fairly effortlessly just walk up to her and walk away with her number.

			According to RSD your chances of picking her up are low since probably you didn't built much state during the day or what do you do with a woman you meet through social circle during the day?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Once you get good enough, building state will not be so important. Especially during the day where you should be more low-key and normal.
</p>

<p>
	Once you get good at pickup, social circle will be like shooting fish in a barrel. It's so easy. Normal dating becomes so easy.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup in loud clubs is like Navy Seals training. If you can handle that you can handle anything.

			Clown around, somehow transfer your state? Like if the law of state transference were all there was, a horny raper would be the best at picking up chicks and getting them horny. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course there's a lot more to it than one law. And state transference is not about clowning around, it's about being grounded, chill, confident, happy, etc. rather than terrified or anxious to be near a girl. Your fear will transfer to her so fast.
</p>

<p>
	State transference is such a powerful principle. It even applies when you're talking to your girlfriend over the phone. Whatever mood you're in will quickly rub off onto her. It's important to understand this principle and use it to lead girls into positive states.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup gets very advanced and nuanced as you get a few years into it. There are hundreds of nuances to learn, but you cannot learn them unless you do 1000s of approaches. I could talk about the nuances of pickup for 20 hours straight to a newbie.

<p>
	I could talk for several hours just about the nuances of setting up the first date to make sure it's most successful. I spent dozens of hours just honing my first date process.
</p>

<p>
	Every part of your game needs to be finely-honed like knife: your dress, your grooming, the approach, the opener, body language, sub-communication, state, small talk, kino escalation, flirting, leading, asking screening questions, logistics, bouncing, managing her friends, managing her excuses, getting phone numbers, texting, setting up dates, isolation, closing, dealing with last minute resistance, foreplay, sex, etc.

<p>
	You do need a solid city for pickup. I highly recommend moving to big city. It's worth it.

	I would look for a torrent of their entire old-school video catalogue. Not their paid material but their free YT videos. That stuff is GOLD. I'm sure it exists online somewhere.

			But what core techniques? I see some good shit in RSD that has helped me but most of it is a numbers game revolved "just have fun, be alpha, be an approach machine" which is too vague, and in my experience more effective on US women, and very less on Europeans.<br />
			<br />
			Most of what they teach is based around doing so much approaches that of course you'll get laid, but there is not much skill or deep inner work involved.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, that hardcore approach machine mentality is basically what you need to gain massive skills and results. It works in Europe and elsewhere of course. It works anywhere there are lots of women.
</p>

<p>
	But they also taught many fundamental inner game principles such as law of state transference, building up state, and much more. Those principles are crucial.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to get good with attracting women without MASSIVE approach experience. You need to be approaching 1000s of women. Everything else is secondary. You will learn the details as you force yourself to approach.
</p>

<p>
	I approached something like 2000 women within a year. And that was still just the start of the learning process. I never got super good at it. But I got A LOT better than when I started.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about sleeping with 100s of women. You'll be lucky to get a small handful from those 2000 approaches. It's about honing your skills and inner game through massive exposure and experience. It's about building yourself up as a man. Any future girlfriend you have will appreciate the strength pickup has built in you for her.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is like meditation. You must do it seriously to get results. It's one of the most challenging things you'll do in your life. But also one of the most rewarding.

	If you haven't seen the HBO mini-series House Of Saddam, you should go watch it now. It's one of the best things HBO has ever produced, and shows you how stage Red functions.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a preview:

<p>
	So Trump can just tweet whatever the hell he wants without repercussions?
</p>

<p>
	What if he tweeted, "Fuck the gays. Fuck the blacks." Twitter should just sit by and allow that?

<p>
	Line has to be drawn somewhere.

	Sam Jackson's character arc in Pulp Fiction is going from Red gangster to stage Blue man of God. It's a nicely realistic arc. Many gangsters do in fact get converted to the "good life" by discovering stage Blue religion and renouncing their stage Red devilish ways.

<p>
	There is a HUGE difference. Stage Orange is materialistic and hedonistic, but it is not ruthlessly violent, power-hungry, or impulsive. Orange is rational. Red is not.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Orange is your typical bank CEO. Stage Red is a Tony Soprano or Joe Pesci from Casino. The bank CEO might manipulate within business to make some big money but he will not stab you in the throat in the process. Stage Red will.

<p>
	You have to really appreciate the ruthlessness and impulsiveness of Red:

			The way I see it, this is an exaggeration. Women can be indifferent to a guy for a while and gradually become very attracted due to behavioral cues that were simply not recognized in the beginning. From a man's perspective, sure, the first few minutes. For a woman... more often than not, I don't think so.

<p>
	Of course for a guy this is more prominent, but even for women, attraction usually happens within 10 to 15 minutes. By the end of the first date the attraction should be very solid. If it isn't, something's probably wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Women can read non-visual and non-verbal cues quickly. I'm not just talking purely about physical appearance. They needs to be "chemistry". You can feel for it.

<p>
	It is possible to take their core techniques and leave behind everything else.
</p>

<p>
	That's basically what I did. Their core techniques are SOLID and they will get you laid. As for their juvenile ways and ideology, that you can just ignore.
</p>

<p>
	It's a good skill to learn to be able to cherrypick teachings, taking only those parts which you want.

<p>
	There is SO MUCH dating material available online. Dig around and try various sources until you find what resonates with you. People require different teachers and styles, depending on their goals.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the most direct and hard dating advice, RSD is the best. If you want to sleep with the most and hottest women possible, RSD is the way. But for some guys that may be too hardcore.

<p>
	You are so young, you got TONS of dating time left. You can date for decades into the future, so chill the fuck out. You don't need to be actively searching for a girlfriend every week like the world is coming to an end.

And when she doesnt respond to my texts or delays our second date I get really sad. And when she eventually rejects me I get depressed for a few days and I feel lots of pain.

<p>
	LOL, yeah, OF COURSE! Getting rejected after a first date hurts like hell. There's no magic pill to avoid getting your hopes dashed and your heart broken. You suffer it and move on. This hurt feeling usually lasts for a week and then you get over it.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Nothing is wrong with you at all. This is exactly how it works.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be free of the cycle, then stop dating. Dating and relationships are fundamentally a cycle of highs and lows. You're NEVER going to find freedom or peace through them.
</p>

<p>
	Or, decide to ride the cycles and stomach the highs and lows. In dating and relationships, every joy will basically end up compensated by some heartbreak or hurt. There is no free lunch in dating/relationships.
</p>

<p>
	If you want stable joy, that can only be found within yourself. It cannot be gotten via others, since others are never stable.
</p>

<title>Not Sexually Attracted.</title>

What is it about him exactly that you don't find attractive? This sounds like a deeper issue than him merely not performing in bed.
</p>

<p>
	Sexual attraction is a crucial component of relationships and it must be screened for from the very beginning. You must be into the other person on a sexual level, and not just a little bit, but a lot. Otherwise even if everything else is good, that part can never be fixed. Attraction is not a conscious choice. You can't work your way into it later.
</p>

<p>
	You should screen for sexual attraction and chemistry within the first few minutes and hours of meeting a person. You have to train yourself to ask yourself, "On a scale of 1 to 10 how satisfied would I feel fucking this guy?" and if it's below a 7 or 8, you should move on, otherwise you'll end up wasting your time and his time.
</p>

<title>Why is America less developed than other countries?</title>

<p>
	Religion is a big factor. Northern Europe is more secular and so its government is not corrupted as much by stage Blue religious fundamentalism as American government is.
</p>

<p>
	Religious conservatism is holding back America's development in the same way that Islamic fundamentalism is holding back the Middle East. When people are too ideological, they don't make empirical decisions.

<title>Why do Christians feel like they’re under attack?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/51047-why-do-christians-feel-like-they%E2%80%99re-under-attack/?do=findComment&amp;comment=659276</link>

<p>
	It's simple: because stage Blue Christianity IS under attack. It is becoming more and more of an untenable ideology to hold in the 21st century. Stage Blue Christians are correct in their fear that stage Blue Christianity is slowly dying and will soon die.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You see Jesus as a radical leftist, but that is not how a stage Blue Christian sees Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different versions of Christianity. Don't assume that just because someone values Jesus that their worldview is the same as yours. Not at all.
</p>

<p>
	People don't see Jesus as he was, but as he fits into their worldview and personal needs. This has always been the case. We have no objective accounts of how Jesus actually was. It's all interpretations by people who admired him.

	All true. But nevertheless God created itself. It is creating itself every minute. When you go to take a crap, there's God creating crap. One minute there is no crap, the next minute there is.

	Since everything is ONE, creation IS existence IS absolute IS eternal.

One might think the defenseless women are being brutalized by the warriors, but it's quite the contrary. The women in the painting (the "Sabine women") are actually intervening in order to stop the fighting between the two groups - the Romans and the Sabines. And the shocking thing? It actually works, the Romans and the Sabines agree to stop fighting and live happily ever-after (lol wtf), a strange outcome considering these times were rife with barbarity.

<p>
	Yes, of course. Which is a good metaphor for femininity stepping in to stop toxic masculinity at stage Red.

	There is a huge different between book-smarts and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	There are millions of smart people in the world, but very few wise ones.
</p>

<p>
	One of the problems of stage Orange is that it confuses smarts for wisdom, when the two are often at opposite ends of a line.
</p>

<p>
	Academia does not teach wisdom.

	God is unlimited. An unlimited thing can create itself, since it is unlimited.
</p>

<p>
	The inability to create oneself is a limit.
</p>

<p>
	If God could not create itself, it would be limited, which is impossible since ONENESS requires that all limits be self-imposed.
</p>

<p>
	If everything is ONE, that means the creator and creation are identical.
</p>

<p>
	You really gotta appreciate that unlimited means ABSOLUTE UNLIMITED! Zero fucking limits!

	I meant Kyle Kulinsky is the fringe, as he complains that the algorithm doesn't favor him.

<p>
	Of course it doesn't.

<p>
	Race IQ is also pretty fringe. It's not serious science and YT naturally will not be friendly to it.

<p>
	Well, it is true that "The Establishment" will not be friendly to fringe, radical ideas which undermine mainstream consensus. But what needs to be acknowledged is that this is not purely some evil establishment plot. It's just the very nature of how mainstream things work. Mainstream things tend to exclude niche things. And this is sometimes good because niche things can be toxic. At least the mainstream stuff has been field-tested to work at scale. Niche ideas have not.
</p>

<p>
	So of course Google will censor stuff like anti-vax conspiracy theories because it simply goes against mainstream science and Google is not going to go against mainstream science.
</p>

<p>
	Huge companies are going to try to accommodate the middle of the road of their customer base. They will avoid fringe wacky stuff that few people are into.
</p>

<p>
	It's like Kyle and progressives don't understand that any time you challenge the status quo, it will push back. That's the whole challenge of making progress. OF COURSE all the giant companies and platforms will not be friendly to radical progressive voices. That is not their job. Their job is to serve the mainstream.
</p>

<title>DMT vs 5-MEO-DMT according to Qualia Computing</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/50977-dmt-vs-5-meo-dmt-according-to-qualia-computing/?do=findComment&amp;comment=658356</link>

<p>
	I've done a lot of 5-MeO and DMT, and the generalizations in that article of their difference do not match my experiences at all.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot draw such conclusions from a few interviews or case studies. Psychedelics affect people extremely differently such that drawing generalizations about what the trip will be like is very difficult.
</p>

<p>
	I hardly experience visuals on DMT. And no entities.
</p>

<p>
	I would hesitate to make the bold conclusion, as the article does, that 5-MeO-DMT is superior for dealing with trauma. I think this will vary from person to person. I personally don't find 5-MeO-DMT that useful for doing shadow work. Lesser psychedelics like mushrooms or LSD might be better for that.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want a robust solution to this issue, you need to give each patient 5 or 10 different psychedelics and have him tell you which ones give him benefits in which categories, such as healing trauma, shadow work, awakening, etc. Experimentation for each patient is crucial. There cannot be a single solution that works for everyone because of how differently our bodies and brains metabolize these chemicals.
</p>

			So Leo, what is your opinion then on the future of AI?  Is it "impossible" to generate artificial consciousness?  It is very easy to create organic life, and there seems to be no "limitation" on organic production, so why would God limit our ability to bestow consciousness on machine life?  
		</p>

		<p>
			If the brain channels infinite consciousness into finite consciousness, shouldn't an artificial brain be capable of doing the same thing?  If not, why?  If so, what does that imply?  (ie. IF conscious AI can be built, does that invalidate all of nonduality?  It would experience Being with no self, and yet be finite and limited)

	1ml of liquid is way too much.
</p>

<p>
	0.5ml is plenty.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason to use more if you're taking a large volume of substance, like 100mg of DMT. But for 5-MeO-DMT, you can easily dissolve that in 0.3 to 0.5ml.

	Yes, I have since upgraded to that better model of syringe.
</p>

<p>
	But again, these are minor technical details.
</p>

<p>
	You are arguing over syringe brands.

	Of course it is. He's clueless that his own logic and cognitive process IS part of "the senses" and is even less reliable than sensation.

		<ul>
			<li>
				1 ml instead of 2 ml for faster absorbtion.
			</li>
			<li>
				you dont put it so deep in your ass like in your method (just 3-4 centimeter). This is critical, because you need to place this substance to the anal column, if you put it deeper it lands in anal rectum and there is little absorbtion.
			</li>
			<li>
				standing instead of lying is better so the substance goes down to gravity and not up to the rectal when lying.
			</li>
			<li>
				you need a  a closed external sphincter so no substance can leak out ( this point I did not understand, because he said you should relaxe this, but would a relaxing sphincter not be open? I can contract my assmuscles so no one can get in, would this not be better?? Please clarify)
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			I will try it out, thank you!
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Lol, that's 90% my method.
</p>

<p>
	I use a 1ml syringe. And it only needs to be filled up half way.
</p>

<p>
	I insert about 50-60% of the syringe. Keep in mind people have different body lengths. I'm 6'2". If you're short you may need to insert it less.
</p>

<p>
	Standing vs lying down makes little difference. It will work equally well in both way. I find it more comfortable to lay down and surrender to the trip (which comes on fast) than standing. You don't want to be standing when 5-MeO kicks in hard in 8 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Your butt hole needs to be closed obviously. It naturally closes up. Your butt hole is never just hanging open by default. You don't particularly need to do anything special with your butt hole. Nothing should leak out.
</p>

<p>
	Taking a shit beforehand is super important. I would not skip that step.
</p>

<p>
	But he seems to claim that whites have an inherently higher IQ and that this is an unchangeable fact.
</p>

<p>
	To me that's awfully close to white supremacy. And it will be taken by his audience as bolstering their racist views. It gives ammunition to racists for being racists while denying they are racists, because "science".
</p>

<p>
	The human mind loves to use "science" and "reason" to validate whatever biases it has. Because it desperately wants to ground its biases in something objective. The whole game of the mind here is to deny that its worldview and biases are purely relative, subjective, and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	Molyneux is in the business of playing that game on behalf of his ethnocentric audience. Racist people need some authority figure who will tell them that their racism isn't actually racism, and that those who call them racists are actually being unscientific.

<p>
	Hateful isn't the best word. I would describe his worldview as tormented and bitter. He's not really coming at life from a place of joy and love, but fear and worry.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know if I've ever seen him laugh during one of his lectures. He's so fucking serious. Like the gravity of existence pains him.
</p>

<p>
	You'll know he's healthy when you can see him talking about SJWs and cultural marxists and just laugh. Laughter is the appropriate response to stage Green stupidity.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, when I talk about politics and lower stage stupidity, I'm laughing half the time. I don't take such things personally because my worldview is able to accommodate it. His is not. You need to ground yourself in something deeper, something nonhuman and nonmoralistic. You must go meta and rise above the plane of petty human squabbles. Yes, some kids on college campuses are doing excessive things. So what?! Let it go and move on with your life. But instead JP's response to that is to grind his axe. That will have negative consequences for his mental well-being. He's bitter and he keeps feeding that bitterness through his public career. That would be like if I made my whole career about attacking atheists. That's a dysfunctional, reactionary direction to go. One's life's work should not be in reaction to anything humans are going.

<p>
	What does Mario's head do exactly in a video game?
</p>

<p>
	Is Mario's head generating the simulation? No. And yet, without a head, Mario couldn't be Mario. So the head is important. You can't just cut off Mario's head. But Mario's head is not causing the simulation, it's a small part of the larger simulation.
</p>

<p>
	Notice: No part of the simulation causes the simulation. The simulation's cause is COMPLETELY outside the plane of the simulation. There is no way for Mario to see what causes his simulated world from within the simulation. Mario would have to jump outside the simulation to understand it. Which is why humans struggle so much to resolve the mind/body problem. It cannot be resolved from inside the dream. You must awaken. You must breaknthrough the dream as a whole. You must see the whole thing as a dream. You must exit the Matrix to see what causes the Matrix. It is impossible to understand the Matrix from within the Matrix. Brains and science are all within the Matrix.

<p>
	To really realize that ideal our government would have to become stage Turquoise.

<p>
	But we don't need to wait that long. Many of those non-western parts of the world will raise themselves to the west's level in the next 50-100 years. China and India are on the way. Especially if the US doesn't bully or exploit them. It would be great progress for the US to just stop bullying others. Many South America countries were terribly exploited by the US, with their democratic populist governments undermined for corporate profit.

	This hinges on how deeply you realize that you are the entire horse race and every horse in the race. If your identity is limited to that of one particular horse, then you will only cheer for that horse.
</p>

<p>
	But it is possible to realize that you are the entire playing field -- that we are all ONE -- and that life does not have to be zero-sum game. By working harmoniously we can all profit.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives identify with one horse.
</p>

<p>
	Progressives want every horse to do well.

	LOL
</p>

<p>
	This sounds so ridiculous once you have some God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	It's people like Pena who became tyrants and mob bosses.
</p>

<p>
	What Pena is missing is that if everyone in the world becomes feminine, there won't be a need for war. So the absurdity is that he wants men to be more macho in order to protect us from other macho men. LOL
</p>

<p>
	Masculinity: that which is needed to protect people from the savagery of masculinity.

			Interested in spirituality but can't stand ascetism. One who has a duality of maintaining an appearance to the world and having genuine meaning inside them. Life purpose is to find beauty and "the perfect place", like obsessed with creating a personal shangri-la where everything is beautiful. Dislikes pain and criticism. Wants to be understood more than anything. Not above debating people for the sake of pride/superiority. Socially liberal and economically progressive. Kinda hedonistic.

<p>
	Well, you lumped a lot of personal development issues together there. Not all of is necessarily a Spiral Dynamics issue.
</p>

<p>
	If I had to guess, you sound Orange/Green. But don't try too hard to look at every issue through the lens of SD.

<p>
	Yes, there's no guarantee the west will remain most advanced forever. It's an endless horse race with different horses in the lead at different times.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why it's silly to make a big deal when your horse happens to gain the lead. Your horse ain't as special as you think it is just because it is your horse.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is to cheer for one horse over all the others when you could be cheering for all the horses and the whole dynamic of the race. Right-wingers make this mistake of cheer-leading for one horse. A horse is a horse, of course, of course, which means in the end every horse dies.

	I do suspect that there is a deep spiritual blockage/neurosis within him. He is fighting with himself at a deep level. But I'm very hesitant to speak about medical issues from such a distance.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is we don't really know what's going on with him, so lets let him be. Only he can sort himself out anyways. Our opinions will not help him. And I hope he gets well regardless of his ideology.
</p>

			Does anyone else get the impression his health issues are tied in with his worldview, and vice versa? He seems to be stuck in such a strong conflict with his own mind that surely this would impact his physical health. No one can be that conflicted and not have it physically manifest somehow.
		</p>

		<p>
			I know that in my own life, whenever I've wrestled with and managed to let go of some darker part of my mind, I have felt an actually <em>physical</em> release of tension / upliftment, and my whole body glows a bit brighter for a while afterwards. I feel like if Peterson, somehow, become open to meditation / consciousness / psychedelics / awakening, he'd be able to purge a lot of his physical sicknesses.

	It could be that, but it also could just be that he's got some medical condition which is unrelated to that. Hard to say.

It is objectively more advanced in many ways. The real problem is when you justify that with genetics, IQ, or some kind of innate superiority when the real reason has more to do with geographical and historical factors, and most importantly the situation is not hopeless or irredeemable. Underdeveloped countries and cultures are fully capable of advancing to the level of white western civilization. It will just take some time. So we don't need to treat them as hopeless, but rather help speed them along.
</p>

<p>
	And also, it's important to acknowledge the great qualities of non-western cultures. In some ways they are better and more advanced than the white west. India, for example, has crazy spiritual development which puts the west to shame.
</p>

<p>
	The general solution here is simple: start loving all cultures and peoples and treat them as if you will one day be born as one of them. Be ware of your own cultural biases and don't try to justify them like Molyneux does.
</p>
