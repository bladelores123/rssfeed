<p>
	It only differs in depth and breadth of understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Other gurus are not wrong per se, their understanding is just not as complete.

<p>
	Of course.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental principle is ONENESS.
</p>

<p>
	It's crucial to realize why reality must be ONE.

<p>
	There cannot be two Absolute Infinities by definition.

<p>
	What you're not conscious of is that from God's POV there's absolutely no difference between a child dying of cancer at age 5 vs that child living a healthy life till 100. From your biased, selfish POV there is a difference between these two outcomes. From God's POV there is no value judgments of any kind and therefore no difference whatsoever. God does not mind dying of cancer at 5 years old. Why would it matter if God is immortal and Perfect?
</p>

<p>
	You see the problem here? God loves itself absolutely. But you don't. Hence you think cancer is a problem. But God does not. If you had unconditional Love, you would not have a problem with cancer or premature death. The only reason you struggle with these things is because you are not conscious enough to love yourself. You are afraid of yourself. But God is not because it is fully conscious of itself to such a degree that no fear is possible.

			Okay, this is the most by far difficult stuff to grasp as our mind thinks in a liner way. When I start thinking of it, it gives me a headache. I can not grasp that time does not exist and never did, and that I will not be able exit from this reality it in the future with my death. Like I will be in this moment forever, or I have never been born. Well, I am okay with it, but what about yesterday? it felt so real, an hour ago was real. I can not understand this. I have a memory of walking outside an hour ago in my neighborhood. I can stomach that I have never been born, but I can not stomach that I have never walked outside an hour ago.

<p>
	That's right. The logical mind cannot grasp it. It's far too radical.

<p>
	That's an even bigger mindfuck. Because God is absolute Perfection and God has no choice but to be Perfect, Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	God cannot not be God. God cannot say, "I don't like diseases so I will stop them". Because God is precisely what is. How can God remove a disease when God IS the disease? God cannot destroy itself because destruction is God too! Since God is Infinite, it is EVERYTHING, and therefore cannot be otherwise and cannot be different.
</p>

<p>
	When you think a disease is a sign of imperfection, that's merely because you lack the consciousness to see its absolute Perfection. Only God is able to understand its own Perfection. You have to be God to understand that God is Absolutely Perfect. A human cannot understand God's Perfection because the Perfection is infinite.

</p>

<p>
	When you wonder, "But what will happen from Leo's POV when his body dies" you are literally creating the possibility of Leo, his body, and it's death. But you aren't conscious of what you're doing. You're taking it all for granted, as if Leo, his body, and its death were real.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's more twisted than that. I have existed in this moment for Eternity. As God. Leo is just some idea God overlays on top of the present moment. Like putting on a mask. There is no reason why you could not pretend right now that you are Leo. That would be as true as me pretending to be Leo. Leo is an imaginary thing. You could imagine you are Leo, or Arnold, or Trump, or Jesus. These are all just masks God can wear. But right now you're too busy wearing your personal mask because you think it is real and true. You think that you cannot be Jesus because that wouldn't be true. But that assumes there is a true mask. But all masks are imaginary. You can pretend to be Jesus from this day forth and it will be as true as the actual Jesus. Since "the actual Jesus" has never been anything more than your imagination!
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is that you're still assuming the existence of a past. Notice how you say, "before Leo life-time". That assumes a past which is real. But the "before Leo life-time" is something you are imagining right now! You are creating the past by imagining it. There never was a "before Leo life-time" and there will never be an after Leo life-time. That is, unless you imagine it to be so. If I start imagining that I'm a kangaroo, then that will be who I am at that moment. If I stop imagining altogether, then I will be Nothing/Formless.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine you had a past life, that becomes true for you. But when you Awaken you realize all of that was imagination at play and none of it was anything solid.

			I've had some awakenings and realizations but I want to see if they correlate to what you're saying. Are you conscious of previous lives? If they exist you could be interacting with yourself from previous lives because time doesn't exist. You know that you're conscious and I know that I'm conscious, both are right, what you are experiencing now is the god head, and what I'm experiencing now is the god head. The only difference is the god head can only experience itself one at a time, and the previous lives are the distinction. Basically what I am saying is that from every single persons perspective, they are conscious, but because time doesn't exist everyone sees themselves as the god head and no one is wrong, because you're just interacting with yourself from previous lives.

<p>
	I have become conscious that there is no such thing as lives, past or present.

	Psychedelics are not about escaping the present. They are about accessing higher consciousness than humanly possible.

<p>
	You will never, ever naturally access the kind of consciousness that 5-MeO-DMT can give you. Not even with 40 years of practice.

<p>
	Awakening is such a radical thing that you simply cannot treat it like any other domain of human knowledge. It is not knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine becoming God, becoming conscious of how time, space, Earth, the body, life, death, and mathematics was invented. Imagine you become conscious of how you designed Hitler. That's what we're talking about. It is not a human function at all. Your life as a human comes to an end.
</p>

<p>
	It comes from pure consciousness. Where does the fact that you exist come from?

<p>
	That's the ultimate mindfuck: there is no death, there is no end. You are imagining an end. This moment and this room are Eternal and exist forever.
</p>

<p>
	Death is just complete Awakening and dissolution into Infinite Love for forever. It is not blankness or void. It is Total Awakeness forever.

<p>
	Your mind cannot possibly imagine or underatand this.

<p>
	Infinite Love is what I am guiding you to. It will all resolve in Infinite Love. But you cannot reach Love through emotions and other human tricks. Love requires cracking the illusion of reality and deconstructing life.

			Obviously you're saying everything is imaginary. My question to you is, by using difference phrasing, is the chakra system fictional? Does it actually exist? i.e. is real in the same way this "table" in front of me is real, like it's an existing structure. I've had strong experiences with my third eye having sensations, or if I'm doing spinal breathing I will interpret there to be energy spots on my spine. What makes this tricky however is the fact this spinal breathing is a visualisation exercise of imagining prana moving up the spine, so my mind can be seeing what it wants to see or my mind rather will change my bodily sensations to match my visualisations ( I need to experiment with this a lot more than I currently am). <br />
			<br />
			So does this structure called the chakra system exist? If it is true that (adding the phrase "If it is true that" because I don't want to pretend like I've directly experienced this) I imagine my nervous system to have an impact on my consciousness. The spine being a part of the nervous system, it is of energetic significance? I'm not ultimately concerned with rationalising it as nervous system or as this or that tbh, I'm just curious what you think about this entire concept of chakra system.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To me it's obvious that chakras are imaginary. BUT! So is the Earth. So... just because it is imaginary doesn't mean you can't use it. The whole point of yoga is to imagine those things and use that to prop yourself up. So I'm not saying it doesn't work.

<p>
	Awakening is not a theory.
</p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	It's not merely that materialism can't explain things. It's fundamentally a total delusion.
</p>

<p>
	You were never born and science is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Not as a theory. Actually!
</p>

<p>
	Your birth is the theory.
</p>

<p>
	Open your mind to the possibilty of direct access to Absolute Truth.

		<p>
			Gutei heard about the boy's mischief. When he saw him in the street, he seized him and cut off his finger. The boy cried and began to run off, but Gutei called out to him. When the boy turned to look, Gutei raised his finger into the air. At that moment the boy became enlightened."

<p>
	Yes, they can help a lot.
</p>

<p>
	But they will not automagically still your mind. That requires years of training.
</p>

<p>
	But a psychedelic will definitely put you into a effortless yet temporary state of samadhi. This is the whole point of psychedelics. They make samadhi accessible to anyone within 10 to 20 mins. Zero training required.
</p>

<p>
	Will you keep the samadhi? No. It will wear off.
</p>

	If we are talking about manifestation of physical objects, then your friend should be able to see it. Or at least you will imagine that he does. Since your friend is imaginary to begin with.

			This increasingly makes sense to me because of psychedelic experiences and understanding sciences like qp and neuroscience. But there’s one thing that I struggle with most and can’t seem to reconcile: if I fly over to Vegas and actually stab you in the eye, you’ll report your subjective experience. Yet you say that I’m just imagining some body with a mind (which is a concept on top of the body’s visual appearance). So that subjectivity that you report to me; all the awakenings that you have, I don’t have access to any of it. So what <i>is that?</i>

<p>
	Other isn't real! Self isn't real either. Subjectivity isn't real either. Everything you see, is Absolute Truth. There is nothing but Absolute Truth. The ego mind has simply mistaken it for a human experience. You need to play this game otherwise you cannot be a human.
</p>

<p>
	The way God becomes human is by imagining that it is having a subjective experience and others are too.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental problem is that you imagine that you were ever born as a human. That's a fiction. You were not born. You've always been this moment now.
</p>

<p>
	It's a mindfuck.

			I talk here from limited human form perspective in this relative world:  what is when two imaginated people look at the coffee table at the same time, the one from the frontside the other from the backside, the coffee table has then a backside in this moment because one of them is aware of the backside. Correct?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, not correct.
</p>

<p>
	You're imagining people, self, other, and the other's mind.
</p>

<p>
	There is only you looking at the coffee table and imagining the other looking at it. In this case, the coffee table still only has one side.
</p>

<p>
	If you ask the other person to describe another side of the coffee table, you will hear some words, but the coffee table will still only have one side.
</p>

<p>
	To be even more precisely, there is not even a "you" looking at the side of a coffee table. There is only the side of the coffee table without a "you" who is "looking". "You" and "looking" are already an illusions of the ego.

<p>
	But it DOES exist for you because you're imagining viruses, atoms, molecules, immune systems, etc.

<p>
	There is nothing behind the scene. Ask yourself why a behind the scene is necessary? It's totally extraneous. Everything that exists is PRECISELY what it appears.

			So a coffee table has a backside because god is omniscient and created this 3D space time object called coffee table and has full access to every little detail (atoms, structure, energy, spirit whatever).. But when I as an imagined person look at a coffee table, I (not God) just imagine the backside of a coffee table. Because I dont have access to the backside of the coffee table with my eyes (I would if I could have x-ray vision).

		<p>
			But in fact the backside of a coffee table is still there thanks to God who is omniscient.  Did I understood you correctly?

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	You are still in the trap of imagining God as some other magical thing somewhere behind the scene, holding stuff in his mind but only revealing parts of it to you.
</p>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	There is no behind the scene! This is all there is! What you see is the whole universe right now.
</p>

<p>
	If you only see one side, the coffee table only has one side. If you were to see 10 sides, that's how many sides a coffee table would have at that moment in time.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that you don't have access to the backside of the table. It's that you have access to the fact that there is no backside, only the side you're seeing. That's what is. That's Absolute Truth. The rest is thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	You are God. God sees precisely whatever you see. Nothing more!

<p>
	It's a common dogma floating around in the spiritual community.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to take into account is that most spiritual people do not think or investigate anything independently for themselves. They adopt spiritual beliefs which they then justify with a few mystical experiences.

<p>
	Yes, you will imagine it to be so, and so it will appear to you.
</p>

<p>
	That's what "stab you in the eye" means. It means you're imagining an other who is getting stabbed by an imaginary you.

			Are you saying that I’m just imagining the visual image of your body and there’s actually no one who’s conscious of that pain? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Obviously you're imagining my body and my pain.
</p>

<p>
	What's less obvious is that you are also imagining your body. If you pay close attention you can notice that right now you are imagining your heart. You have no heart until we cut your chest open, at which point you will imagine a heart there, and it will appear. << This is what we call reality.
</p>

<p>
	And thus the illusion of reality is created. You imagine everything at precisely the moment it is needed to render the illusion. A video game engine does not render anything other than those pixels necessary to create the current frame.
</p>

<p>
	Why would God waste its time creating things it cannot see?? In fact, the problem runs even deeper: it is impossible for God to do that because God is omniscient. So God cannot hide from its own awareness. Anything God creates must be fully accessible to it at all times. If a coffee table had a backside, God would have to be aware of it. So if God wants to see a coffee table from one angle, it must create only that face of the coffee table and nothing else.

<p>
	You're not going to acheive emotional mastery without some degree of awakening.

	Texts have been written about how to develop siddhis. It usually involves training concentration and visualization abilities massively.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine focusing so hard on a mental image of a rock that you can manifest a rock.
</p>

<p>
	That's some serious fucking concentration skill. Not for the faint of heart to accomplish.

	The difference is, you are God.

<p>
	This part requires serious awakening to see.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself this simple question: have you ever seen the back side of an object, ever?

<p>
	It's very simple. The only thing that exists in the universe is what's in your experience this second. The end.
</p>

<p>
	You have absolute access to the whole of Creation at all times. But the trick is, the whole of Creation is nothing other than what you see now. No object has a backside. If you can't see it, it does not exist. Very similar to how a video game is rendered. There is nothing more but the rendered POV.
</p>

<p>
	That means you image the moon, the stars, the Earth, trees, clouds, your parents, your first day at school, your car, your pet dog who died, that time you went to the dentist, your last meal, that time you had sex, etc. You are imagining all those things right now in order to create the illusion of reality. Because that's all you are: infinite consciousness.

			Well, since you're god you'll eventually experience what it's like to be me, posting this comment - or maybe you already have. The scenario of being me exists in infinity  So Leo responding to me still "does" something because you're creating an experience that will eventually be experienced in both perspectives; being the one questioning and the one responding, but on the other hand it still doesn't really matter at all because infinity is infinity. I am you, we are just separated from each other due to god experiencing infinity. Is what I am saying aligning with the truth?

	I am conscious that there is only me, and nothing else, with no future and no past. Teaching you is completely an illusion. But, hey, the game must go on.

	But you are right, from your POV there's no way you can know if what I'm saying is true. Such is life. Maybe everything I say is wrong. So what are you gonna do about it?

<p>
	Yes.
</p>

<p>
	It usually takes 100s of hours of such awareness for those qualities to start to appear.
</p>

<p>
	The monkey mind disturbs the awareness with agitation and craving. Like rain drops on a still pond.
</p>

<p>
	Pacifying the monkey mind usually takes 100s or even 1000s of hours of meditation or other kinds of inner work.
</p>

<p>
	Pacifying the monkey mind is actually harder than Awakening itself.

<p>
	That's exactly right.
</p>

<p>
	Self and other are defined relative to each other. So a person who has never seen outside the self cannot really understand what other is. To erase other is also to erase one's self. Which puts you face to face with death. The mind cannot intellectually go there.

	These are still stories and games.

<p>
	Your psychedelic journey has only begun. Don't quit so soon.
</p>

<p>
	You do not yet understand God or Awakening. So don't make any firm decisions about not doing stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You have only dipped your toe in the ocean. The terror of it will go away. It took me 1 year to overcome the terror of my first big 5-MeO-DMT breakthrough and to go back for seconds. It was all games and fear.
</p>

<p>
	These days when I trip there is no more terror. Only awe, magic, and Love. But it took close to 100 trips to reach this point. I promise you it's worth it. Just go slowly.

<p>
	The very notion of a self or an other is imaginary. People assume that self and other are like fixed quantities in the universe. They are not. Self and other only exist if they are imagined to exist.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way. Before a painter paints a painting of other people, there is no self or other on the canvas. Other has to be painted to exist. Self has to be painted to exist. Otherwise it's just a single canvas. You are not the painted self, you are the whole canvas.

</p>

<p>
	The books will blow your mind and change your life and you will never look back.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be so paralyzed by avoiding bias that you are unable to take a decisive step.
</p>

<p>
	Risking $35 is like the lowest risk in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Reading books is not an epistemological submission to anything. I've read many books which were flat out false. And many of the books in my booklis are flat out false on many metaphysical issues. But that doesn't matter. It's all part of the process.
</p>

<p>
	You can read a book on witchcraft, disagree with it, and still come out wiser and better for having read it.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to verify a book's truth before reading it. That's backwards. First you read it, then you can assess how true you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot find truth unless you're willing to explore dead ends. Because you can't know ahead of time what is and what isn't a dead end. So a serious truth-seeker must have a high tolerance for risk. You gotta try stuff and fail more and faster than everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Read 200 books, and if they all turn out to be false, great! Now you know which books to avoid as you move on to read the next 200. << That's how you master life. Not through perfectionism and fear of making a mistake. I've read so many bullshit books in retrospect. They were all part of my journey to truth. There was no way I could know they were bullshit until after having read them and many years had passed.

<p>
	It's possible in theory, if the dose is overly high.
</p>

<p>
	But a 1g dose of mushrooms or 125ug of LSD is not going to give anyone a psychotic break unless maybe they were already psychotic to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	You have understand that the few people who have psychotic breaks and so forth are already damaged to begin with. The psychedelic isn't what causes it. A lot of damaged people do psychedelics because there's such a huge stigma around it that "normies" are too chicken to try it. A normal person is not going to ever have a psychotic break from 1 or 2 grams of mushrooms. You have higher odds of having a serious reaction to Aspirin or penicillin.
</p>

<p>
	The doctor gave me penicillin last year and I had a horrible allergic reaction to it. Yet penicillin is prescribed every day without anyone even thinking twice about it.

<p>
	I agree with that. That is a great shame.
</p>

<p>
	But that's easily avoided with low doses.

<p>
	Why would a psychedelic do damage? What does "damage" even mean here?
</p>

<p>
	DMT is not gonna "damage" you at moderate doses.
</p>

<p>
	It will fuck with your mind, but that's not damage.

<p>
	I don't know if that's necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe some day. But 5-Meo-DMT is far superior to that for our work of Awakening. 30g of mushrooms will throw you into a twisted nest of crazy dream-like consciousness and you'll hardly remember a thing when you return. Mushrooms are very chaotic and twisted. Not good for reaching clarity.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said, the mind cannot fathom Awakening so it tries to fit it into some category it knows, like solipsism.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not solipsism, but it's also true that you/God is the only thing that exists. So to you that sounds like solipsism and you can't tell the difference.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			I can understand that from absolute truth everything is one and therefore god as pure solipsim. But in the relative world where every person is in dual world, how is there solipsim?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To create that distinction between the absolute and the relative is already a mistake. The relative isn't real. Only the absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, if you want to qualify as "relative", then we can say that you are not alone. But this is precisely the illusion which we're trying to transcend.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like if you said, "Yeah, I understand that Santa Claus isn't real in the absolute sense. But in the relative world he's real." Okay, but what we're interested in is the absolute sense here, not the relative world of illusions. As an illusion, sure, everyone you know seems "real".
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Of course I imagine everyone but when I talk to someone which I imagine, <u>this person is also imagining me as a person</u>. Am I correct?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, you're not correct.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine that there is a person who imagines you. But actually there is only you imagining others imagining you.
</p>

<p>
	When you talk to someone you imagine, you are imagining that person's body too, not just their mind.
</p>

<p>
	To put frame it another way, your imagination is so powerful it IS reality! Right now you're still under the dualistic illusion that there is a difference between imagination and reality. As if imagination is somehow inferior or bad. But the difference between reality and imagination is itself something you imagine! This is what allows you/God to create reality out of thin air. Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	Where did all the people you know come from? They were NOT born from biological parents. They were imagined by your mind! If you stop imagining them, they will cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	What makes Awakening very different than classical solipsism is the God part. Classical solipsism has no recognition of self as God. Once you reach God-consciousness, the solipsism stuff becomes pretty irrelevant because you are so amazed at yourself as God.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The true Awakening is yet ahead after you integrate and move past all the above.
</p>

<p>
	Take time to integrate all that, but don't stop there.
</p>

<p>
	Killer first trip. A lot for one trip. Too much really. Gotta baby step it not to freak yourself out. You rejected the enlightenment simply because you were too overwhelmed by it without enough gradual tripping and integration work. You needed a return to the safety of your old life. You'll come around. It takes a lot trips to iron out all the resistances, shadow material, and kinks before you can access full God-consciousness. It cannot be done in one or even 10 trips.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's not something I've had success with yet. But also not much practice.
</p>

<p>
	My healing has been derailed by ever deeper awakenings which make healing oneself seem like a moot point.
</p>

<p>
	Healing is a lower power than Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	When you are fully conscious that you are God, nothing needs healing. There is no difference between being healthy or sick at that level of consciousness. The desire to heal is in some sense egotistical. It assumes that something is less than Perfect, which is a delusion.
</p>

<p>
	At the same time, I do want to heal. It's practically necessary to keep doing my work. Life sucks when you got a chronic illness.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, he says some of the same stuff. But it's a question degree and depth. He's certainly much more awake than most humans. But then there are levels which I don't believe even he has ever accessed given his limited neurochemistry.
</p>

<p>
	For example, he talks about past lives, opening chakras, his wife leaving her body, etc. This is all imaginary from my level of realization. I don't get the sense that he is conscious that such things are part of his imagination.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I realized for the first time that God is real, at which point my heart filled with energy that seemed to explode and shoot out my fingertips like Force lighting, and it terrified the hell out of me. I was filled with God's Absolute Love. I realized that Love is not just a human emotion but something much more fundamental and metaphysical.
</p>

<p>
	It took many more awakenings to get a fuller understanding of what God and Love actually are. That was merely by first introduction to those notions. It was so radical and otherworldly that my mind had no frame of reference to understand it. It took me about a year to integrate that one breakthrough.

	Yes, it's fucking insane. I have had moments of awakening so profound I literally had to go on the toilet and shit because I could not hold myself together.

			A model that I heard, and I can wrap my mind around is that you're not moving through time, but shifting through many static images per second, thereby creating a sense or illusion of continuity. Okay the whole reality, the whole shebang is here right now, just shifting through frames, okay fine, not something new here for me. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that's somewhat the right idea. In fact, imagine there is only ever 1 frame in existence.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that reality is 1 fluid frame. That's it. The end. This one fluid frame can change its shape without ever creating a second frame.

			"Your parents start and end right now!", if you mean here their appearance (or appearances as they only exist as static pictures) in/as 'my' experience, yes alright.<br />
			<br />
			"You are imagining right now for the first time that you've imagined the past in the past many times before, thereby creating "memory"." You say that you imagine for the first time that there was a past. What are you trying to say here, how is a first time possible if there is no time? Maybe you just mean that the whole shebang is here right now, and so an experience of thought -that gets labeled memory- isn't referring to something that happened before. That memory experience is only a snapshot/experience and doesn't exist before or after the snapshot/experience "to which the memory refers". Is that what you mean?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that's sorta what I mean. If there is no time, that means everything is Eternal. It has existed forever. So this one fluid frame exists eternally, with no beginning or end. The beginnings and ends of the frame -- questions like where did it come from? What caused it to be this way? etc. -- are imagined. So if you ask, "Where did the current frame come from?" the mind will invent some causal explanation like, "Well, at one point I came out of my Mom's vagina and then I started using my eyes to see the world." << This is imagined and invented in the present to create an illusion of reality.
</p>

<p>
	It's just like how Hollywood invents backstory for its characters. The audience might wonder, "But where did Batman come from?" at which point some writer in Hollywood will just imagine a backstory to make Batman seen more real, like "Batman was born to some rich parents in Gotham city 40 years ago." And the audience is gullible enough to just buy it without ever realizing it's just pure fiction. Batman didn't come from rich parents. Batman was invented by some Hollywood business people to make them money! That's where Batman really came from.
</p>

<p>
	Could you imagine if you were watching a Batman movie and someone asked Batman about his origins and Batman replied, "Well, you see, the CEO of Warner Brothers wanted to buy a new yacht so he could bang his mistress without his wife finding out about it, so he greenlit this shitty movie. So here I am." You'd shit your pants. That's not what you wanted to here. It's too true! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

	Gradually, gradually, see how high you can go without whiting out. White out is no good. You should have some decent headroom before white out.

	For me, 30mg is getting to max territory. 15mg is a normal breakthrough. 25mg is a heavy as fuck breakthrough. Plugging.

			Then what is that which is changing? For example, let's say that i cut my finger and now i have a wound. My body is different from a moment ago (which is memory --> imagination). I get it. But what is this which still can change? Can you explain this? There are things that i have in the present which i didn't have in the past. My body ages in time. Time doesn't exist. Only the present. But there is still change happening and then physical death some day. So do i also imagine aging (for example), "material" changes?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's easy. What's changing is Consciousness. Consciousness is that which imagines the present into its current shape.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is like a gaseous cloud that has infinite shape-shifting ability. This shape-shifting "cloud" is the very substance of everything. Yet it has no inherent substance of its own. It is literally pure imagination made manifest as brick walls, cars, trees, bodies, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a cloud in the sky which can change its shape to become a brick wall, a car, a tree, a body, a memory of your parents, etc. That's what the room you're current sitting in is. It's just hard for you to notice it because the room feels very concrete and rock solid. The cloud is like frozen for you right now. So you can't see it's cloud-like fluid nature. Because it is a fluid acting as a solid. The solidity is just an act which can easily be dissolved with psychedelics or some other practices.

<p>
	Since there is always only the present moment, in this moment you can either be in a state of God consciousness or not. If you are in a state of God consciousness, that's it. It doesn't matter how long it lasts. It could last 1 minute or a lifetime. The difference isn't important from the absolute POV -- since in fact all states are Absolute. But if you fall out of God consciousness back into a state of sleep and delusion, it will matter to you in the relative human sense in that you will have a memory of how good God consciousness feels and you will want to return to it but may not be able to, thus creating suffering.

<p>
	That's a tricky question to answer. Yes, there is, but then also there are even fuller ones.
</p>

<p>
	I assume at some point one becomes so conscious Earthly material reality would just disappear forever (AKA physical death). I can only speak to God realization while still remaining within Earthly reality because that's where I wish to remain for now and I could not communicate with you otherwise.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's also a tricky question to answer. I don't have a full solution to that yet. Still working on it.
</p>

<p>
	But the assumption that psyches don't create permanent changes is false. Maybe you can't fully live from that peak, but they still create changes in you which will last for a lifetime. It's just a question of how much change are you looking for? If you want to be in peak God consciousness 24/7, I'm not sure yet if that's possible. Seems doubtful. Enlightened masters are not always peaking.
</p>

<p>
	But you should be able to inch closer and closer.

<p>
	It's far more radical than that. Since all difference is absolutely relative, there is no difference whatsoever between start and end, therefore it never started. You are imagining right now that it started at some point, and thereby you create the illusion of it having started. This illusion of a start is indistinguishable from reality, so it seems as though it started. But it never did. Everything always starts and ends right now! Your parents start and end right now! They were never real! They didn't give birth to you. You are concocting that story on the fly RIGHT NOW for the first time! This is its start and its end.
</p>

<p>
	It's absolutely crucial to become conscious that there is no difference between start and end within consciousness. Oneness cannot have a beginning or an end.
</p>

<p>
	There was never just void. That void is something you imagine existed in the past to explain the present. But past is something you're imagining right now for the very first time! Even the idea that you've imagined the past before is wrong, because that assumes a past! You've never imagined the past before. You are imagining right now for the first time that you've imagined the past in the past many times before, thereby creating "memory". Memory is nothing but imagination in the present. Everything you think you remember is actually you imagining for the first time in the present without realizing that you're doing so. Ta-da!

	This is false.
</p>

<p>
	Those people are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing whatsoever outside your present moment. You are just still in denial about that. If you look very precisely and carefully you will notice that all other people have been your imagination 100% of the time. Even to deny what I'm saying you must imagine a Leo!
</p>

<p>
	Notice that you are talking to yourself, not Leo.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is a radical thing. Keep deconstructing your reality.

<p>
	Yes and no.
</p>

<p>
	You are God and Love right now, and always, but you are not remotely conscious of that. It's the consciousness of it that matters. If you aren't conscious of it, you aren't Awake and it is not true for you.
</p>

<p>
	An idea that you are God & Love is not the same as awareness of yourself as God and Love. Just as an idea of being a millionaire is not the same as sleeping on a pile of cash.
</p>

<p>
	This requires a change in your state. All states are God, but not all states are aware that they are God. That's the key difference. You need to be in a state where you are aware of it, not merely thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
	It's more than just a realization or an insight, it is a live change in one's state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	When it is your live state, the issue of letting go of it becomes inapplicable. You are it. Or you are not.
</p>

<p>
	Holding it intellectually can become a problem, yes. If that's what you mean.

</blockquote>

<p>
	When you realize that death = Love, that will be it.
</p>

<p>
	To realize this you must actually experience death. (Without physically harming the body.) Don't worry, it's impossible to miss it. But you can fool yourself into thinking you've gone all the way.

<p>
	The notion of "permanence" requires deconstruction because it is dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	What is the difference between permanent and temporary if all is one?
</p>

<p>
	At the moment of full God-realization, there is no such difference. But of course you're not likely to stay in that God-consciousness for long. You will fall out of it over and over again. But even so, at least you'll have a memory of what Absolute Love is. Which is a great thing to have. It can serve as your compass in life.

<p>
	Even someone with a heart awakening still has only a tiny sense of what Love truly means.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be an understanding of Love without full God realization. Because God is Love. But you do not understand what God is, so you do not really understand what Love is.
</p>

<p>
	The only one who can understand what Love is, is God. So you must become God. Which simply means you must Awaken. Really, really, deeply Awaken. Profoundly Awaken. You must Awaken deeper than the Buddha. And how do you do that?
</p>

<p>

<p>
	This works assumes you are mentally stable and grounded. My teachings are not suitable for people struggling to make it through their day.

<p>
	And watch your disrespectful and accusatory tone.

<p>
	Be careful.
</p>

<p>
	The person in the above video is not awake and his explaining is incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	There are no others. Period. It's only you imagining stuff.
</p>

<p>
	But awakening is far more radical than simple solipsism.
