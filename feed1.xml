<title>Best Long Term Consciousness Retreats?</title>

There are insights, there are states, and there is your baseline level of consciousness. All of them can be affected.
</p>

<p>
	You certainly cannot maintain a peak 5-MeO-DMT state because you would barely be able to walk. But it changes you even though you drop down. The sense of self is expended beyond your body.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, do both is the suggestion.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	No, you will not be anywhere close to that conscious. You will be lucky to get a few glimpses. But the value of the work is not just in getting glimpses. There's a lot more lessons than just enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Most of Peter's apprentices are not enlightened at all, not to even speak of deep enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Which is not to say anything negative about his programs. They are great. But you are grossly underestimating the amount of work it takes to awaken that deeply. I have watched his apprentices struggling and struggling and failing and failing to grasp what they are or what reality is.
</p>

<p>
	Not to brag, but I have awoken deeper than any of Peter's apprentices who I have met. And that is thanks to 5-MeO-DMT. Such degrees of consciousness would take you 40 years of work to attain.
</p>

<p>
	Total omniscience is possible. But you won't get that through any kind of apprenticeship program.
</p>

<p>
	Still, I recommend his programs. It's not the program's fault you are so asleep <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	If you're not using 5-MeO-DMT you're looking at 10, 20, 30, 40 years of work to reach the highest levels. The reality is, you will probably never even know you missed the highest levels because you will be so far away from them even after 40 years of work. Unless if you are supernaturally gifted. And that assumes you're working your ass off on this work, not just half-assing it the way most people do.
</p>

<p>
	It's still worth doing the work. So don't get discouraged. Just don't ignore the most powerful and direct tool there is for awakening. It would be negligent to do so.
</p>

<p>
	You will not understand Peter's full depth without psychedelic assistance, I can promise you that.
</p>

<p>
	None of this is to discourage you. Just the opposite, it just shows you how deep this work goes. So get excited! You have a lot of room for growth.
</p>

But you'd need massive, massive enlightenment for that.
</p>

<p>
	At the very center of the onion is God. If you fully become God, you will become a walking, talking vehicle for God's Love on Earth. Literally. You will walk around radiating God's Love to the whole world. Very few people get this far.
</p>

<p>
	You won't just be a vehicle for God, you will actually be the one true God. At this point your life is totally selfless and devoted to the betterment of all of living beings. Your love for the world will be infinite and you will be in paradise all the time. You will need nothing because you have become everything.
</p>

<title>What Coaching Certification is awesome.</title>

<p>
	The certification itself is basically irrelevant. What you really care about is finding the best program which teaches you how to be great coach and the business aspects of coaching.
</p>

<p>
	IPEC is the program I completed. It's quite good. It taught me valuable skills which I would not have learned any other way.
</p>

<p>
	Can't speak about any others since I only have experience with that one.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I have very little info about it.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like a decent spiritual community. Keep in mind that any community will be somewhat cult-like. But I don't think Isha is too bad. Although I don't know. The trick with real cults is that they hide their activities behind fake pleasant fronts. But from what I can sense about Sadhguru he is too responsible to allow Isha to be a proper cult. I don't think he would stand for it. After Sadhguru dies, then I would expect some serious problems to hit Isha as his followers wrestle for power with no authoritative voice like Sadhguru to guide them.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with building large organizations is that once the founder dies, it will easily get co-opted by devils and turned into a machine for devilry. That's one of the reasons I keep Actualized.org small.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot extract 5-MeO-DMT from plants, which is how most N,N-DMT is made. Very few people synthesize N,N-DMT in a lab from scratch. It can be done but from what I know these methods are not readily known. And the precursor chemicals will be watched by government agencies who will arrest you for purchasing them.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bad idea to get involved with that.

The insights can be hard to make sense of.
</p>

<p>
	It helps very much to have a solid theoretical foundation in nonduality and spirituality beforehand. Which means reading lots of books and developing a theoretical framework. That helps me a lot. So when I trip and I see some new insight I can say, "Oh, hey, that's what that Zen master was talking about!" or, "Hey! That's what that yogi was talking about!"
</p>

<p>
	If you come into psychedelics with zero study, you will be so lost. You won't be able to make sense of it.
</p>

<p>
	Watching my videos should help a lot with this. People who trip need to watch my videos.
</p>

<p>
	Well, you also don't want to be so paranoid about that that you become paralyzed and don't help the world at all.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to be perfect to improve the world. That's too high a standard which few people can meet.
</p>

<p>
	Try to help the world as best as you can while being careful not to start a cult or do harm. That's all. Be very self-aware and open to feedback. Be careful with constructing or preaching ideologies. That's where a lot of harm can happen.

Thanks for taking the time to respond. How would you define projection then? I wouldn't doubt my understanding of it is flawed. Or perhaps you have a video on it I missed I could watch?Â 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Projection is when you judge another for the very same thing which you yourself are doing. The judgment is an exteriorization of your own guilt and self-judgment. But by projecting this bad trait out onto some "other" you can avoid looking at it within yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The classic example is this:
</p>

<p>
	Let's say you were raised to believe that homosexuality is a sin for which you will get sent to hell. But you find yourself having mild homosexual urges. But you cannot admit this to yourself so instead to get angry at some flaming homosexual on TV. So you start to badmouth that homosexual and you vow to punch him in the face if you ever meet him in person. All of this is really just you denying your own homosexuality.
</p>

<p>
	Scientific studies show that men who hate homosexuals are more likely to be sexually aroused when they are shown naked photographs of men than those who do not hate homosexuals.
</p>

<p>
	Another example would be: If you're acting like a selfish devil and you start calling other people selfish devils, that's projection. Or if you're cheating on your taxes but you get angry that rich people don't pay enough taxes, that's projection.
</p>

<p>
	For example: Donald Trump will call any news he doesn't like Fake News when in fact he is the biggest purveyor of fake news. He will call people liars when he is the biggest liar there ever was. He will call investigations of him biased because he is the most biased President there ever was. He will complain about rigged elections because he himself was rigging the election.
</p>

<p>
	In general the ego wants to be as selfish as possible while denying that it is in fact being selfish at all (because this allows it to be even more selfish!) So the best way to do that is to divert attention way from its own selfishness by point out the selfishness of others. If everyone around me is so selfish, then I'm actually an angel. And that's precisely the self-image I want to have so that I can justify being more selfish. If I see myself as the least selfish person in the world, that suits me just great. Now I got a lot of selfishness to make up for <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> Now I can steal, rape, and kill without guilt.

<title>The trickiness of Projection</title>

</blockquote>

<p>
	This is too loose a definition of projection. Projection is a very specific thing. Not every statement is projection. By taking that sloppy stance you dilute the meaning of the term and actually normalize projection.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that I and others can always be wrong about things. I never say I'm perfect in my assessments of situations. When I call someone a devil usually it's not a projection but something that's quite obvious they're doing. Of course sometimes it could be a projection. But mostly it isn't.
</p>

<p>
	When you see that a child is behaving foolishly by playing with matches, that's not projection. That's your higher wisdom and experience warning you of an impending problem. It would be foolish of you to allow him to play with those matches. The problem there is legitimate, he cannot see it, but you can. There is a good reason we don't let kids play with matches.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of having wisdom is that you're able to accurately distinguish between foolish and wise actions. It's not always perfect. But you can get pretty damn good at it. That's why experience is so valuable. So when I call someone a devil, that's usually coming from a deep set of experience. I can see the epistemic traps that people are falling into which they are not able to see yet. Often because I have fallen into those traps myself in the past.
</p>

<p>
	It's always a matter of inching our way upward. We don't need to get rid of all ideology. We can start split-testing certain concrete policies immediately. For example we can easily split test legalization of marijuana. Reasonable people can agree to such an idea.
</p>

<p>
	We can even split-test the building of a Mexican border fence. Just put massive gates along the fence which we can open at any time to nullify the barrier.
</p>

<p>
	The point of doing a public split-test is so that after the test is done people agree to whatever the results are. It's a consensus building device.
</p>

<p>
	I never smoke it. Plugging is my fave method.
</p>

<p>
	Freebase can be converted to salt fairly easily or even just the freebase itself should be pluggable when dissolved in oil or something besides water. I have yet to validate the plugging of freebase. I'll have some news on that soon.
</p>

<p>
	The Glass Vapor Genie is good for vaping. Meth pipes also work of course, but they can be a bit hard to control. They can burn easily. The Glass Vapor Genie will work much better.

			the only way to solve the problem
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, there are many ways to solve problems and I was just giving one example of a possible Tier 2 solution. It's certainly not the only method I would use.
</p>

<p>
	Split-testing ideologies is really not that good because ideology itself is the problem. Ideally we would create an education system which teaches children so well about how ideology works that all ideology would be wiped out within a few generations. Of course this will never be allowed in practice.
</p>

<p>
	In the meantime, we have to work within the bounds of what people can handle. We can't reform society too quickly or it will backfire.
</p>

<p>
	It would be nice to have some objective ways of adjudicating public policy issues. Because right now it's just people spouting their opinions without any concern for what the effects of the policy are. For example, tax cuts are made without no concern about how they impact society or if the economy is actually made better or worse by them. We need a definitive answer as to which tax rate leads to highest consciousness. This is a scientific question, not an ideological one. If the optimal tax rate turns out to be 90%, that's what we should make it. If it turns out to be 10%, then that. The point is not to get attached to any specific policy but rather focus on maximizing consciousness for the majority of people. Whatever helps to push us in that direction is what we should all agree on.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in practice there will be tons of resistance, since people are selfish devils. But in the long-run higher consciousness always wins out.
</p>

<p>
	I am not suggesting we scientifically test entire ideologies. That's doesn't seem possible. Ideologies are not empirical by design. But what we can scientifically test is very narrow concrete policy proposals such as:
</p>

<p>
	A) End the drug war for 10 years, monitor social stats to see if crime rate and other indicators rises or falls.
</p>

<p>
	B) Restart the drug war for 10 years, monitor social stats to see if crime rate and other indicators rises of falls.
</p>

<p>
	Then pick the best one.
</p>

<p>
	My best guess is that option A would be much better than option B. But we don't know that for sure. We need to run a test and see. There may be unforeseen problems with ending the drug war. For example, maybe too many teens start doing heroin and we have massive overdose deaths.
</p>

<p>
	Countries could also run different tests at the same time and pool their results. So, for example, the UK could run this drug war test for 20 years while the USA is testing something else. Then we look at their results and use it to help shape our next policy choices. This would be the intelligent way to go about it. In this way we could crowd-source the evolution of government very quickly. Imagine 100 countries running such tests for 100 years! The end result would be a really smart and efficient government. Of course our currently government is nowhere smart enough to adopt such an approach. But one day it will be.
</p>

<p>
	The structure of the best government for maximizing consciousness is really a structural engineering problem. Some designs will be much better than others. The problem is that no one really knows what the best design is. This requires an evolutionary process to discover. Just like designing the best rocket.
</p>

<p>
	What we should all be able to ultimately agree upon is that maximizing consciousness and love is best for all life forms overall. Of course it would be bad for selfish unconscious devils, so they will be the ones who will try to stick a wrench in the works.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	So it's not a question of which photograph is true vs false. They all contain some part of the truth. Some photographs are more revealing than others. You would not understand much of what an elephant is if I showed you a photo 2 inches from its ass.

<p>
	I will smoke it at some point just for testing purposes, but I'm perfectly satisfied with plugging. The dose can be increase to any potency you can handle. Weakness of trips is not an issue for me. My trips are about as strong as I want them. Anything more would start to get problematic and potentially dangerous. The last trip I took was insanely powerful. Most people would freak out on a trip such as that. It's such a profound mindfuck I cannot even put it into words. Just when I think I've got all the mindfuck there could be, there's more.

	I like the metaphor of jailbreaking a smartphone. If you've ever tried to jailbreak it, the phone has anti-jailbreaking software which tries to block you from jailbreaking it. That's exactly how your mind is. Your mind has anti-jailbreaking mechanisms -- and they are way more sneaky and sophisticated than any iPhone. It takes a genius to break free.

<p>
	Yes, this is a common problem. Tier 1 thinkers tend to be too simplistic and one-dimensional. They don't see systemic problems. That requires Tier 2 Yellow cognition. And even then it's tricky. We have to admit that we don't always know how complex systems will behave. Which is why a scientific approach to public policy is so important. We need to split test solutions and track actual results.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine the following approach:
</p>

<p>
	Democrats propose change A to the education system.
</p>

<p>
	Republicans propose change B to the education system.
</p>

<p>
	A coin is tossed to see which change we split test first. We try it out for 10 years and we track the results with a non-partisan committee of scientists. Then we implement the other change and track those results for 10 years. Then at the 20 years mark we look at the data and select whichever produced the best results. Citizens could also be allowed to vote on which produced the best results. Once this process is complete we settle the issue forever and move on to other issues.
</p>

<p>
	In this way we don't keep rehashing issues like abortion rights, taxes, marijuana, immigration, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Of course partisan & ideological people will not want to agree to such a system because their ideology does not want to be tested in the court of real-world experience. That's the whole point of an ideology. It's held true come-what-may.
</p>

	My contribution is to make people aware of the problems and the solutions. To get them thinking properly. To install the proper mind OS. That's how philosophers and intellectuals contribute to advances in government.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I'm not gonna run for office. That's not my role. My role is intellectual, visionary, and inspirational.
</p>

<p>
	I would not make a good politician. I've said too many crazy things and I'm not really a people person.

	The real problems are systemic and much bigger picture than that.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some basic problems:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Improving education to make it more conscious
	</li>
	<li>
		Reducing waste on military-industrial complex
	</li>
	<li>
		Making it easier for all people to vote without discrimination
	</li>
	<li>
		Eliminating corporate lobbying and money corrupting politics
	</li>
	<li>
		Retraining the police so they don't shoot unarmed black folks
	</li>
	<li>
		Protecting the environment from destruction and toxic pollution
	</li>
	<li>
		Ending the drug war and for-profit prison system
	</li>
	<li>
		Regulating the banks so they don't crash the economy
	</li>
	<li>
		Regulating giant monopolistic companies like Amazon from dominating everyone else
	</li>
	<li>
		Making medical care affordable for everyone
	</li>
	<li>
		Making college affordable for everyone without massive debt
	</li>
	<li>
		Redistributing wealth so we have a thriving middle class, not a handful of billionaires
	</li>
	<li>
		Putting workers on all the boards of major corporations
	</li>
	<li>
		Helping young teens find their life purposes & train them for passion jobs
	</li>
	<li>
		Helping train people to start small businesses & giving them funding
	</li>
	<li>
		Funding for scientific & medical research
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving basic infrastructure like road, bridges, airports, schools
	</li>
	<li>
		Massive push for green energy
	</li>
	<li>
		Allowing people to vote for directly on propositions at the federal level the way they can at the state level
	</li>
	<li>
		Public funding of all elections
	</li>
	<li>
		Strengthening people's ability to unionize
	</li>
	<li>
		Regulating the giant telcoms
	</li>
	<li>
		Giving Constitutional protections to whistlerblowers like Ed Snowden
	</li>
	<li>
		Increasing government transparency across the board
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Stuff like that
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that we're trying to structure society in a way which enables more people to meet their basic needs and pursue higher consciousness without a lot of obstacles. How should society be restructured to facilitate that? How do we get as many people up the Spiral as fast as possible?
</p>

<p>
	See, most people don't even understand that the goal of government should be CONSCIOUSNESS! If we could just get people to realize that, half our problems would be solved. But of course they will NOT agree! They will resist. Because most people's goal is to use government for advancing their own egoic agenda. That's when the shitstorm ensues.
</p>

If you just spend a little time checking out her content on youtube you can clearly see that she has psychological issues, she spent 13 years inÂ an abusive cult before she escaped. You don't just leave a cult like that and have no issues, There are lots of allegations against her. If you just spend a small bit time doing research on her you can see she is a Fake. she has all the spiritual lingo to impress but she probably learned all of this when she was in her cult. She might not have Cult yet but its heading that way or maybe its already happening. TheseÂ Types of Fake spiritual teachers are very dangerous because they can confuse people and lead them off the path and can cause a lot of damage.Â

	Do not quote RationalWiki ever on this forum. It's delusion of the highest order. You can link to it in the Stage Orange Examples Mega-Thread for us to laugh at.

<p>
	I have spent enough time listening to libertarians debating their talking points to the point where I don't feel I need to hear any more. I got it.
</p>

<p>
	But if you haven't, sure, it might be worthwhile to do so just to see how foolish it is.
</p>

<p>
	While you're at it you can study Nazi ideology, Communist ideology, alt-right ideology, and many more. There is value in studying foolish philosophies. But at some point you gotta let it all go because there's bigger fish to fry and real work to do, and life is short.

	It's just that once you're aware of enough things, you quickly sort the wheat from the chaff and don't waste your time entertaining silly things.
</p>

<p>
	There are too many foolish ideologies in the world to debate them all seriously.
</p>

<p>
	You are welcome to believe whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	My interest is in talking about conscious politics, which is at a completely different level than typical political discussions. But it is not neutral and it does not tolerate nonsense or devilry.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, people expect consciousness to be neutral towards their foolishness and devliry. But it isn't. Consciousness shreds through bullshit. So if your position has bullshit it in it, you may feel like you're being treated unfairly.
</p>

<p>
	I don't have all the answers, but I have better answers than libertarians, that's for sure.

You can pick any random mantra and use it to meditate.
</p>

<p>
	Here, I'll give you a free mantra you can use which will be as good as any other:
</p>

<p>
	"rum lum da, rum lum da"
</p>

<p>
	There you go! Now repeat it mindfully a million times. That's all mantra meditation is.
</p>

<p>
	You will get better results with Kriya yoga and it's free.

<p>
	That's not entirely correct.
</p>

<p>
	Goodness beats out badness. Badness only arises when one isn't conscious enough and resists.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not just random. As you become more God-like and pure, the bad trips will become less and less frequent.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's important not to overdose or trip in the wrong settings. Taking 10 grams of mushrooms at a noisy music festival is a recipe for hell.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to trip is with small and moderate doses. Until you're very comfortable there.
</p>

<p>
	I have a feeling that 90% of all problematic trips could be eliminated simply by dosing lower and sitting in a quiet safe space free of people.
</p>

<p>
	Simply do not take high doses of anything. It's stupid and it will not grow you as much. Only take what you can handle.
</p>

<p>
	1-2g of mushrooms or 125ug of LSD is plenty for most people. Spend a couple of years working those doses and getting all the growth you can from them.
</p>

<p>
	People who take 5g of mushrooms or 400ug of LSD are being foolish. So of course they end up getting wrecked.
</p>

			I don't think you understand the philosophy behind libertarianism. Otherwise it would be blatantly obvious for any integral thinker to see the importance of implementing libertarian principles in good government
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Good government already assumes protections for individual liberties. You speak as if government is some kind of totalitarian enterprise. That's not good government at all.
</p>

<p>
	Good government delicately balances between individualism vs collectivism & freedom vs limitation. It does not take ideological or absolutist stances on either side.
</p>

<p>
	Individual liberties are only possible through mutually agreed upon and self-imposed limitations. For example, you are not free to own a nuclear weapon because if such a liberty were allowed then all humans would be dead, thus ending all liberties for everyone. You are also not free to discharge a firearm in an airplane for obvious reasons.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with the libertarian philosophy is that: A) it is purely a philosophy and disconnected from real life, and B) it is an ideological position of freedom absolutism. Absolutist positions do not work. They are a form of fundamentalism. Here you have a case of free market fundamentalism. So libertarianism is actually a kind of religion with all of the problems religions creates, just in a secular vein. If you notice the way in which libertarians defend themselves, it's very similar to how radical Muslims defend themselves. The mental gymnastics are similar.

You just gotta take them in stride and keep your eye on the ball -- your larger vision. Why can't you run your business from another location? Why can't you follow the code?
</p>

<p>
	This is an opportunity for you to take your business to the next level, make it more professional.
</p>

<p>
	Your anxiety is understandable, but it's also clouding your vision, so don't stew in it for too long.
</p>

<p>
	If you build your business properly it should not be so fragile to be tanked by one code violation.
</p>

<p>
	Even if this business ends up failing, remember, that's just valuable experience for building your next, even better business. So hang in there. When it becomes to business you gotta be persistent like a python strangling its prey.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, life will get really hard at times.
</p>

<p>
	Have you considered renting a small office? They can be very affordable.
</p>

<p>
	It seems some people have a serious immunity to it. Like it just fails to work on them.
</p>

<p>
	Very odd. Hope you guys can figure out why that is.
</p>

<p>
	You might need to try smoking/vaping it.

</p>

<p>
	Give it a week, you'll feel better. Let it pass.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like you were shown some deep truths which you were not ready to stomach so you resisted it. That's all material which must be worked through. That IS the real spiritual path.
</p>

<p>
	Before you reach the rainbows and butterflies you must face your inner demons.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms are a twisted and mischievous substance. Might want to try something more straightforward next time like AL-LAD. And lower your doses.

<p>
	The deeper question is, why would you care to escape it? The way your question is framed it assumes that escape is better than not-escape. But this is only true if you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	God escapes itself, then it returns to itself. Since it has nowhere to go, since it is in all places at once. Liberation is to realize that there is nowhere to go, nowhere to escape because all places are equally good. So long as you think that one place or state is better than another, you will suffer and seek to change your state. To be liberated is to be surrendered to whatever state happens to arise, seeing the perfection of them all. If you try to cling to any one state, including formlessness, it becomes a problem.
</p>

<p>
	You can't escape the totality of what you are.

<p>
	Well, obviously, since that's basically what enlightenment is.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to sit and concentrate on nothingness for many thousands of hours. Or do decades of yoga.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga is basically a method for naturally producing 5-MeO-DMT or its equivalent. Dark room retreats are another method. Long fasts are another method. Shamanic breathing is another method.
</p>

<p>
	All these techniques are designed to change your state of consciousness.

<p>
	The point is to investigate. This is a truth-seeking project. You have to want to sift through everything to get to the bottom line.
</p>

<p>
	Warning: that is not the same as armchair skepticism or cynicism. Sitting around and doubting stuff via an online forum is not genuine truth-seeking, it's a distraction.

<p>
	Your mistake is thinking of life as bondage. It only is if you think of it as such.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a kid is sitting there enjoying playing his video game and you come up and tell him, "But what's the point of all this dying and suffering?! Let's turn it off this bondage."
</p>

<p>
	The problem is not with the kid, but with you. Bondage is a way of looking at the world, not a fact of the world.
</p>

<p>
	It can beÂ exciting to know that you will get to live many different lives, experiencing the world in many different ways.
</p>

<p>
	One day you will be born on Mars. That will be a cool life. One day you will get to be the Pharoh of Egypt. That will be cool. One day you will get to be a bald eagle soaring through the sky. That will be cool. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's all cool from God's POV. Even the "bad" stuff. The key is to adopt God's POV.

<p>
	There is a very good reason why no nation in human history has ever been libertarian. Because it would be pure hell. In fact, it simply could not be suatained forÂ more than a few decades before it collapsed.

<p>
	You don't have to give up experience to be liberated.
</p>

<p>
	Experience is nirvana, is infinity. You just need to be more conscious of what experience really is.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation is NOW, NOW, NOW! Find it in the NOW or you won't ever find it.

<p>
	I have been in that place. Form does not have to stop being created for total liberation. Form is perfect however it is.
</p>

<p>
	How can you be liberated if you need form to stop?

<p>
	Be careful! That is merely your assumption. Many people have died and returned.

<p>
	Nothing and Everything are identical.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of realizing this. It's not that you're realizing anything totally new, but you're going deeper and deeper down the same rabbit hole, realizing God more and more and more until finally you hit total omniscience.
</p>

<p>
	The highest truth is not nothingness. It is that you are God and you have direct consciousness of how you are creating the entire universe -- every last grain of sand on every beach in the universe. To somehow separate nothingness from form is actually a shallow level of nondual realization. There are much deeper levels.
</p>

<p>
	All of this, and more, 5-MeO-DMT can show you effortlessly. These are levels of consciousness which even the highest spiritual masters rarely attained. At these levels of consciousness you are literally God. You are the creator of all spiritual masters. Your power and authority is total, singular, and absolute. No teacher can teach you anything at this level because you have become all teachers, and more. This level of consciousness is completely unspeakable and unimaginable. And yet it is the ultimate truth.
</p>

<p>
	I hope one day ya'll reach it. But I wouldn't bet money on it unless you're doing lots of 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Those are serious allegations, IF true.
</p>

<p>
	But I have no idea who this woman is or if she is being accurate, or if she is somehow disgruntled.
</p>

<p>
	Again, the only way to adjudicate this matter is to dig into all the details and see it for yourself. I am not in the business of doing that. All I do is make general meta points about how cults work, so people are armed with the best wisdom possible.
</p>

<p>
	One of my top values with Actualized.org from day one is independence. I strongly discourage my students from worshiping anyone or being loyal to any one teacher or teaching, including myself. This should be obvious from the body of my work.
</p>

<p>
	From what I can intuit, there probably ARE some cult-like activities happening in Mooji's community. How bad it is, I have no idea. But none of this changes his status of being awakened in my book. To what degree he is awake is hard to say. In the end it doesn't really matter to me because I don't hinge anything on it.
</p>

<p>
	People who worship him are fools. Women who sleep with him and expect something from it other than sex, are also fools. To me this is so obvious it doesn't even require saying. But I certainly understand how young naive spiritual seekers can get suckered into it.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind that if a spiritual teacher is doing his job right, there will be plenty of people who hate him and spread totally fictious rumors about him.
</p>

<p>
	People make shit up about me all the time. It's quite shocking to see totally false stuff written about you. I've seen it and it always baffles me. That's because the ego-mind finds very creative ways to deny truth, often attacking the messenger. It cannot be otherwise. Ignorance cannot help being ignorant.
</p>

<p>
	Both of theseÂ things can be true simutaneously.
</p>

<p>
	As a general rule of thumb: be very careful about joining any ashram. They are notoriously cult-like in various ways because no one there has bothered to study cult dynamics. To be awake does not mean you automatically understand cult dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	To be fair, IFÂ Mooji is running a real cult, the tactics they use can be so sneaky and manipulative that it will be very difficult to report them to the police.
</p>

<p>
	Many serious and violent cults go completely unreported to police because they so brainwash their members.
</p>

<p>
	A member of my extended family was in a cult where she was sexually abused and she still has not publically spoken out about it for fear of retribution from the cult leader, who still runs that cult to this day. It's been running for decades and abused so many women they have a dedicatedÂ support group just for the ex-members of that one small cult. And yet they are unable to stop it.
</p>

<p>
	True cults are very sneaky.

</p>

<p>
	Projection cannot work without also the denial that one is doing it. Hence people who do it the most have no idea they are doing it. To them it simply feels they are right.

	Sadhguru's ashram can only exist because of a massively complex government which protects it from destruction and ensures his property rights. Otherwise a horde of Mongols would invade it,Â burn it to the ground,Â rape all the women, killÂ all the men, and enslave all the children.
</p>

<p>
	So while of course Sadhguru himself will never go fight off Mongol hordes, the only reason he doesn't have to force anything on you is because he has a government army and police forceÂ do the dirty work for him. They stop the devils soÂ that there can be peace enough for enlightenment to be taught "without force". Yet if you go to his ashram and start acting like a devil, they will call the police and force you off the property.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Sadhguru is wise enough to understandÂ and appreciate all this. The problem is, you aren't.
</p>

<p>
	You fundamentally do not understand what government is, how it came to be, and why it is necessary.
</p>

<p>
	No monastary tolerates devilry. They will kick you out if you don't follow their very strict rules. TheÂ devilry that you guys get away with on this forum would never ever be allowed in a serious spiritual school. Half of you would have been kicked out long ago. Some of you would have been slapped hard across the face for your foolishness. Most of you would never have even been allowed inside in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	This question has been answered many times.
</p>

<p>
	Inside/outside is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness/body is a duality.

<p>
	That is the scoop.
</p>

<p>
	But the big end is not 25mg for 5-MeO HCl. More like 10mg.
</p>

<p>
	You'd need 3 flat scoops for a 30mg dose of 5-MeO-DMT HCl. Roughly speaking. Oxalate seems to be a heavier molecule and less fluffy, so it would need maybe 2 or 2.5 scoops for a 30mg dose.
</p>

<p>
	With HCl I usually do 1.5 to 2 scoops. Roughly 20-25mg. That's the perfect dose for me. Your perfectÂ dose will vary from mine. It takes trial and error to find it.

		</p>

		<p>
			For me, there are huge variations in mood. The second week I tend to be most stable andÂ active, the week before my period I can easily get tense or depressed. The day before my period is usually the time when I'm most vulnerable, but also the time when my deepest insights come - I rely of this time of the month to show me what I've been neglecting in my life, what my most recent topic to look at is. Any experience is amplified.

<p>
	Best to do it when you are most stable and non-moody.
</p>

<p>
	But also, 5-MeO will alter your state so much that you will forget you ever were a woman. So itÂ won't matter at that point. It's the before and after where you might struggle with your moodiness or physical discomfort.
</p>

<p>
	Probably don't do it on your period.

			Then, what exactly is it if you think I haven't experienced it? You're not me Leo. You don't know what I've experienced fully. I will eventually talk about the whole thing in my life purpose, to the best of my knowledge. I know that the 10 Ox Herding Pics is pointing to something. Otherwise, it wouldn't be there. It's not there for no reason. I agree with Peter Ralston when you interviewed him. He said that there is nothing beyond the absolute, but<u> <em>you could have as many distinctions in the relative</em></u>. And, I like how Shinzen Young talked about Riding the Ox Backwards. This is part of the absolute. I'm going to be honest with you, Leo. I'm not sugarcoating this. It seems like you keep wanting to experience the distinctions, the everythingness. The nothingness is "you," the No-self. This is the absolute. You can't get beyond you without any ego. You never had an ego to begin with. "You," the No-self, <u><em>fell</em></u> back into your ego (Riding the Ox Backwards).
		</p>

		<p>
			Another thing Leo, when I do my LP, I don't want to misguide ppl on this topic. That's why when I post here, I find myself writing, if you experience Satori, say it in your LP in a cunning way so that those who are ready to hear it will hear it. Ppl who have been working with gurus told me that you cannot force it on others. It's like a chick trying to come out of its egg. Sometimes when you try to help it out by removing its egg shell, you end up killing it instead.

<p>
	Nothing you said is news to me or contradicts what I said above.
</p>

<p>
	You seem to be assuming things about me, like that I am not aware of the things you say when in fact I am aware of all that and a bunch more beyond all that.
</p>

<p>
	So again, watch out for your assumptions.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing you think can prepare you for the levels of consciousness of 5-MeO-DMT. It is beyond all human teachings or teachers. And the only way to understand that is to do a lot of it. If you don't want to, that's fine. But then don't speak of it or judge it.
</p>

<p>
	All teachings are a joke compared to 5-MeO-DMT.

It's tooÂ easy to turn meditation into just daydreaming. That is not proper meditation and so it doesn't produce benefits.
</p>

<p>
	So you need to find a formal technique and stick to it rigorously.
</p>

<p>
	Or try something like Kriya Yoga. It's more powerful than regular meditation and you can feel the benefits pretty fast, within weeks/months.
</p>

<p>
	Either way though, you gotta make your technique more strict. This workÂ requires serious self-discipline. That's why it's difficult and most people don't do it.

	Unlike you, I don't subscribe to "rights" or childish notions of freedom. Me and every other sane person will get together and limit your ability to be a devil precisely because we don't like devils running loose. So we will physically prevent you from enslaving others. And you'll have to deal with that or die.

<p>

	While you talk childish nonsense we will create a better government and better world for the majority of us. You will end up benefiting from our work even though you sit there and make a mockery of it.

			You're taking away a precious right, and really who are you to take that right away? You're infringing on territory that's not yours?

</blockquote>

<p>
	All rights are human egoic constructs. And part of your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Who are you to say I don't have a right to take away your rights? If I want to, I can enslave you. You are free to defend yourself, if you can. Let's see who wins.
</p>

<p>
	Don't tell me that I am not free to enslave you. Who are you to take away my freedom?
</p>

<p>
	See, the truth is you only care about maximizing YOUR freedom. You only care about freedom WHEN IT SERVES YOU. So you are just bindly acting out your selfish agenda while disguising it as some higher principle. The truth is you cannot tolerate true freedom because true freedom is the most dangerous thing to your ego. You want to restrict people from enslaving you. That's not freedom, that's limitation.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarianism is just a clever trick of the ego-mind. It's a stage Orange ideology. There's nothing deeply truthful about it. It is deeply hypocritical and hopelessly naive about human power dynamics and political history.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarians areÂ ignorant of how government actually develops and works. Because they don't believe it's worthwhile to study because they believe government is bad.

<p>
	While individual growth is very important the whole point is that it is not sufficient. Systemic change is required. New ways of understanding social problems are required. Collective action is required.
</p>

<p>
	Individualism cannot get us to where we want to go.
</p>

<p>
	So the point of talking about conscious politics is to elevate our current political duscourse, otherwise it stays at stage Blue/Orange/Green.
</p>

<p>
	We can't just sit around waiting for people to evolve individually up to Yellow. We gotta change the discourse and culture in such a way that people grow into Yellow and understand what proper collective action looks like.

<p>
	That's not a good way of looking at it.
</p>

<p>
	Life itself requires discipline. You can't just act on every silly impulse you have. Those impulses are often egoic.
</p>

<p>
	And love is not a matter of force. Love is a deeper thing.
</p>

<p>
	This whole topic of conscious relationships is very big. We have not covered it yet at all.

	If you don't trust my guidance then find a teacher who you do trust. Otherwise what is the point of these interactions? In a spiritual school you come and learn from the teacher. You don't come to school the teacher. That is backwards.

<p>
	You can disagree with me of course. But is that a risk you really want to take? Up to you of course. You've been cautioned.

<p>
	This will sound arrogant, but assuming your understanding is deeper than mine is a dangerous position to take. But you're totally free to take that position.

<p>
	There is no voluntary choice about being in a society. You are part of society whether you like it or not. You're living in a libertarian fantasy land where you think that ants have a say about whether they are part of an ant colony. They do not have such a luxury and neither do humans.
</p>

<p>
	Without society you are dead. It's as simple as that. So you have no choice unless you want to die. In which case, feel free to go off and starve in the forest alone by yourself. That is your choice. The rest of us must figure out better ways of living together.

	Cooperation is mandatory on this planet. You can refuse cooperation but you may be killed for it. So expect much worse than a ban if you actually stick to your ideology. Of course you are a hypocrite and you do not stick to your ideology because it is impossible. Otherwise you'd already be dead. You are only alive thanks to society. But in your mind you think it's all you just being independent. This is delusion and arrogance of the highest order.

It's just impossibly good. Nothing more is needed. It is total consciousness. Nothing else is in the same league. You will become totally omniscient if you do it enough times. Totally omniscient! There will not be a single question left unanswered. You will understand how you created the entire universe.
