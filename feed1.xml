	I vote and support Bernie. So it's not like I am passive. I just do it in an non-ideological way. That's a thing many of you guys still struggle to get: how to be non-ideological.

	By even entertaining such an idea you start to legitimize it as a possibility.

<p>
	It's sort of like saying, "Well, what if we bring slavery back?"

	No! This is not even on the table so don't put it on the table.

<p>
	Of course it will feel unnatural at first. You keep practicing it until you can stare and talk at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	The nice thing about deep eye contact is that it's so powerful that much less needs to be said.
</p>

<p>
	I would focus less on being a chatterbox and more on transmitting seductive and sexual energy through your gaze.
</p>

<p>
	Also, slow down the rate of your speech. Slow and steady.

	I think Bernie will be able to keep his cool and break Trump down with common sense logic, calling out his policy failures.

<p>
	I don't think the debates will matter at all. Trump is not going to gain any more supporters and he will not lose any current supporters either. So all a debate will do is entrench both sides.
</p>

<p>
	Trump may even refuse to do a debate. Although it might be too tempting for his ego to stay away from the spectacle.

<p>
	As soon as you feel anger, get directly underneath it by asking the question, "How have I been hurt here?"
</p>

<p>
	The anger is a false mask for hurt. Become conscious of the hurt and sit with it. Allow yourself to feel hurt.
</p>

<p>
	The crucial mistake is trying to be invulnerable. Be vulnerable. That is what's true. All finite forms are vulnerable.

<p>
	Those weird experiences open your rigid mind. Which is crucial in this work.
</p>

<p>
	How can you hope to master consciousness when you don't even want to explore it?

<p>
	I have a much better understanding of the traps of this work and communicate that. Of course that still doesn't make the process fool-proof. But my teachings are far more advanced and accurate than JP's. Again, not that my teachings are necessarily perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, all teachings are relative, but some are better than others. Especially if we're talking about advanced topics like overcoming suffering or understanding God. Very few people understand such topics accurately.

<p>
	Devil is a technical term in my lexicon.
</p>

<p>
	Demon means something else to me. To me a demon is an actual demon-looking entity. A non-human.
</p>

<p>
	Devil is the right term because it implies deception and trickery. Which is what we're mostly dealing with in this work. Devil is also the opposite of God, which is exactly what the ego is. It's a very powerful term once you get a handle on it.

			Last year I took a trip with a gal who is an intermediate-level Reiki student. We went to an energy vortex in Sedona, AZ. She was vibrating even before we dosed.  . . .  During the trip she met some type of spirit guide and went to another realm. When she returned, she started crying and said "I can do it myself now. I no longer need anyone else to do it". She advanced a full Reiki level that day. Literally. When she returned, she was immediately advanced a full level. She was able to move energy on her own.

<p>
	Peterson has no clue what enlightenment is. Nor is he Spirally aware.
</p>

<p>
	Attachment to meaning is the source of all suffering. So he is unwittingly leading people straight to hell, along with him. That's what ignorance does. The pursuit of falsehood (objective meaning) is devilry.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to understand suffering, Buddhism explains it perfectly. The solution to suffering is perfectly clear. Yet no one wants to do it. People love to beat around the bush.

<p>
	Learning to living more and more selflessly is the whole point of life.
</p>

<p>
	The more selflessly you live, the more profound and rewarding your life will be, until one day your selflessness reaches an infinite degree, you become God, and your life is complete.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing holding you back is fear.
</p>

<p>
	Do not let people bully you into thinking that the pursuit of God is somehow selfish. It's just the opposite, and your only path to salvation. If you lose touch with your desire to be selfless, your whole life is lost. You have sold your soul to the devil. Of course devils will try to convince you that being selfless or pursuing God is selfish.

<p>
	I have explained this in the past.

<p>
	Without voting, you will have tyranny. Do you value being enslaved? Are you so lazy and cynical that you would rather be enslaved than spend 1 hour every 2 years voting?

<p>
	You can define all you want, but it will mean nothing until you go through the looking glass yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Talking about what's through the looking glass is not the same thing as being through the looking glass.
</p>

<p>
	Talk is cheap, and direct experience is not a philosophy. It's what is.
</p>

<p>
	The possibilities of consciousness cannot be described in words.

</p>

<p>
	So what exactly did you become conscious of?
</p>

<p>
	Do you understand what God is? What Love is? Why existence is?
</p>

<p>
	I don't doubt you had some awakenings, but just trying to ascertain how deep they went and what may be left to realize. Many juicy facets of this thing.

<p>
	There are no shoulds. Do as you like.
</p>

<p>
	But I recommend you engage in politics to the extent that you vote regularly and you have a sense of which politicians to vote for -- which are most conscious. Otherwise devils will rule over you.

<p>
	Of course it doesn't need improving from the absolute perspective. But there is also the relative perspective of survival. And there is also the perspective of God wanting to help all beings awaken. For God to awaken more beings it needs to create a more conscious society.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Survival has a deeper component to it than merely survival. The ultimate point of survival is so that an organism can live long enough to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	The entire movement of the material world is basically there so God can share its love with finite beings. And politics is part of that Grand Design.

<p>
	Enlightenment is in short supply because the cure is worse than the disease -- from the ego's POV.
</p>

<p>
	It is like getting a broken leg and then the doctor telling you, "Okay, don't worry, we'll solve this problem by cutting off your head."

<p>
	That's precisely backwards.
</p>

<p>
	You are prioritizing survival over truth, which is is the mother of all human problems.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not in this discussion to say, "Nananan bo boo. Told ya' so." I'm here to hopefully get readers to realize the origins of all evil -- stemming from self-bias of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	When you put survival above truth, you become the devil. And as you do this, you imagine yourself to be an angel. If you really care about corruption, carefully contemplate what was said in my video: Understanding Corruption. The corruption starts and ends with you. You are not going to end evil with evil.
</p>

<p>
	Your fear of getting fucked over is the evil which corrupts your mind. The very same evil which corrupts the minds of all those corporatists you fight against.

The fact that you ban those that criticize your views and provide really good reasons why - should be a concern from a long term perspective.

<p>
	No, I was merely pointing out the most obvious and likely interpretation which was being overlooked in favor on some nefarious DNC plot.
</p>

<p>
	You skipped "It was just a bug" and jumped straight to: "DNC plot to screw over Bernie" -- because that's what your paranoid mind was looking for.

<p>
	A DNC plot is always possible. But it's foolish to jump to that conclusion based on so little evidence.

<p>
	I didn't. I was worried he might win precisely because he appeals to stage Orange.
</p>

<p>
	But the difference is, now, after 4 years, people are much clearer about who Trump is. In 2016 Trump won because he had fooled lots of people with this fake successful businessman persona. People voted for him because they assumed he would be like an ordinary successful business executive -- like Mitt Romney. They didn't expect him to be an incompetent racist moron man-baby scumbag. Now the cat is out of the bag.
</p>

<p>
	Back in 2016 it wasn't fully clear how Trump would govern or behave in office. Even those who thought it would be bad didn't expect the total circus we got.

<p>
	Yes it does. Trump pissed off a lot of people, even some classic Republicans.
</p>

<p>
	2018 showed it.

<p>
	Those are his lapdog supporters.
</p>

<p>
	Most of the country is repulsed by him.
</p>

<p>
	I think beating him will be easy. Bernie or Pete will beat him.
</p>

<p>
	Trump can pander all he wants be he's not going to gain any new supporters. Minorities certainly won't fall for his bullshit pandering. The pandering is to give cover to the racists in his base, so they can feel comfortable in their minds about not looking like racists.

<p>
	Absolutely
</p>

<p>
	Marxism is important to study, but the trick is not to become ideological about it. Which means holding it loosely, not getting attached to it, not creating an identity out of it.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with people in those Reddits is that they make identities out of the ideologies they defend. That always becomes limiting and problematic.
</p>

<p>
	Marxism can be as toxic as capitalism when adopted as an ideology. Because the common structural problem is lack of self-consciousness. See my video: Content vs Structure. Marxists think they are superior on content grounds, while structurally it is still an ideology like capitalism.
</p>

	No, most bros I know are pretty solid Orange. At least in urban parts of America.

<p>
	Red is pretty rare these days in developed parts of the world.

<p>
	The difference between Orange and Red is that Orange will posture about being macho and alpha and may start a drunken bar fight, while Red will stab you in the throat with a fork and strangle your dog.

	That's why you must be careful with your stereotypes and categories.

<p>
	For some people, the idea of a smart black man also does not compute. Which is the very source of racism.

<p>
	Everything is relative.
</p>

<p>
	Pete is far more liberal and openminded than the average person in the country, and certainly the South.
</p>

<p>
	But is he as liberal as TYT hosts who love to bash him? No
</p>

<p>
	Pete is a moderately liberal guy which is decent for someone from the Mid West. He's not from San Francisco.

<p>
	Calling him a racist is pretty silly.
</p>

<p>
	Racism is a complex and nuanced issue. There is personal racism and systemic racism, which is much more subtle. Someone can have no personally racists attitude and yet still be part of upholding a systemically racist institution for many complex reasons, chiefly, his own survival.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	He's not some open racist. You're saying it as though he's a KKK member. This is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	The accusation is that he inappropriately fired a black police chief due to political influence. But even this requires serious proof. There are many reasons why he could have fired him. Maybe you should listen to Pete's version of the story before jumping to conclusions.
</p>

<p>
	One can have biases and blindspots without being explicitly racist. In fact, most of us have such biases. If I put you into a position where you had to fire a black police chief to feed your family, you'd probably do it without blinking an eye. And you would never ever consider yourself a racist for doing so.
</p>

<p>
	Of course being gay does not automatically make one a champion for African American rights or justice. Mostly likely Pete just grew up in a white bubble where African American rights were not even a topic of conversation or concern. He would have to go out of his way to care about that.
</p>

<p>
	I grew up in such a white and affluent part of the US that I didn't even know racism was a thing until well after college. When you live in a great part of the country, you don't even know what injustice is. The notion that a cop would treat a black person different than a white person was impossible to even imagine where I grew up. It would be like worrying about people eating dogs.

			One definition of mysticism is: belief that union with or absorption into the Deity or the absolute, or the spiritual apprehension of knowledge inaccessible to the intellect, may be attained through contemplation and self-surrender. Another important one is: the belief that direct knowledge of God, spiritual truth, or ultimate reality can be attained through subjective experience (such as intuition or insight).
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is a correct definition, but you don't understand the significance of what it means. So while it seems like you might understand it, you actually don't because you haven't had your first mystical experience yet.
</p>

<p>
	Beliefs about mystical experience are not mystical experience. And there is no substitute for mystical experience if you want to understand mysticism.

<p>
	That's the most truthful thing you've said in your whole post: "I don't know". The problem is, while you mouth those words you still take your own mind's stories and conclusions seriously. Which means, while you say you don't know, actually your mind is filled with all sorts of false knowledge, beliefs, and assumptions. To truly not know it is not enough to just mouth the words, you must actually do the work to clear your mind of a lifetime of garbage knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	You have to really appreciate that your own mind is the enemy here. Thinking about stuff is not the same as direct experience or consciousness. You can think about the Absolute for a million years and you will be no closer to it.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be very careful about convincing yourself that you understand a thing when you really don't. You speak as though you understand things like the Absolute, consciousness, God, not-knowing, direct experience, thought, belief, etc. But it's clear from where I sit that you have no clear consciousness of what these words refer to. You have not done the contemplative and meditative work to distinguish these things in your experience, so they are all muddled up and confused. That's okay. That's where everyone starts. But you must be honest about this with yourself and not pretend like you understand any of these things. It takes much work to start to understand these seemingly simple and basic things. For example, you do not even understand what a thought or a belief is yet. That's because you've taken them for granted your whole life and no one in school taught you what they were (because they too did not know!).
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing you have to understand about this work is that this is not armchair philosophy. Mysticism is serious business. More serious than science. There is real work to be done to excavate your entire mind and psyche. We are talking about years and decades of careful and focused contemplation and introspection. And there are many, many ways you could fuck it up. Hundreds of ways to trick yourself and delude yourself. Only after you have successfully navigated past years of mental traps will you maybe, maybe, get a glimpse of the Absolute. And it will horrify you so much that you will run away. Then, if you dare return, it will take you many more years to finally be able to look the Absolute in the straight in face and start to understand what it really is. And even so, you could still fuck it up at any point. An impure ego-mind can distort the Absolute at any point.
</p>

<p>
	When someone like me is able to speak clearly and confidently about the Absolute, what you need to appreciate that it literally required decades and 1000s of hours of research and practice. You don't see the work when you hear me speaking. I make it look effortless when it's anything but. When you see Tiger Woods hit a golf ball it looks so simple and easy, but he's been practicing every day since he was 4 years old. And even he can fuck it up if he's not careful.

<p>
	Nothing wrong with sex, but it is one of the lower joys of life.
</p>

<p>
	Most people's lives involve: sleep, eat, shit, work, fuck.
</p>

<p>
	There are higher ways to live.
</p>

<p>
	An awakening beats an orgasm every time.
</p>

<p>
	If you're pre-occupied with sex, you're stuck on living from chakra 2. Which is pretty low. At some point you'd be wise to outgrow that. Doesn't mean you have to stop having sex, but it just becomes less of a priority in your life.
</p>

<p>
	Of course lots of people judge sexual openness because they suppress their own sexuality.
</p>

<p>
	Also, peoples' sex drives differ. Some low, some high.
</p>

<p>
	You Bernie supporters are overlooking a very simple fact: election irregularities happen often in American politics. This is nothing new. Voting is a messy process. If you give them time, they will go back and double-check everything. But you're so impatient that you don't want to give them time. You automatically assume something nefarious and scream for instant results like children.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, you might wish everything worked flawlessly, but that's not how it's ever been. We live in reality. Iowa actually was more transparent than ever this year. And it's their effort to improve the system which ironically screwed it up.
</p>

<p>
	As if you've never tried to improve something in your life and it ended up coming out worse. People with honest intentions screw things up all the time.
</p>

<p>
	This whole incident is a textbook example of self-bias. And you still don't understand how deep the problem of self-bias goes. You are acting out your stage Green ideology, like unconscious monkeys. And then you wonder why politics is so dirty. You are making it dirty by flinging shit around. If you want a conscious society, first, start acting consciously.
</p>

<p>
	What you're doing here is not conscious politics. It's business as usual with a progressive ideology.
</p>

<p>
	This is a good example of what happens when Green goes too far in its desperation to defeat Orange and Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, people are that obtuse. You can see it because you are probably exceptionally conscious and developed.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are very closedminded and see the world in black/white, I'm-right/you're-wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Tucker Carlson is quite obtuse. His worldview does not account for relativity or multiple perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	Or course Cornel West is much more able to understand Tucker than Tucker is able to understand him. Cornel West is a world class intellect. Tucker Carlson is an ideological hack.

<p>
	No you have not. You're not even close yet.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is completely outside your ability to think or imagine. It is like a new dimension of reality which you have no idea even exists or how to access it.
</p>

<p>
	This is extremely tricky stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine dying and discovering something on the other side of life. That might give you a sense of how radical awakening is.

<p>
	I think you're misunderstanding what surrender and letting go means. It doesn't mean to act on all your impulses because many of those can be of the ego.
</p>

<p>
	The key you're missing is consciousness. You can't really fake that. Your level of consciousness is crucial. An ego cannot just ape being God and reap the benefits. You need to actually have an awakening and do work to raise your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is incapable of surrender, really. It will fight tooth and nail. It will play games. It will pretend to be spiritual. Etc. It takes a lot of work to get past all that bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	For an ego, life will not be smooth and effortless, it will be filled with suffering and struggle.
</p>

<p>
	None of your stories or meanings are Absolute Truth. Absolute Truth is what dawns after you realize everything the mind says is relative and basically bullshit.

			Pete is the second most popular establishment Democrat in the polls. So, he’s put all his campaign money into ads in the first states... especially Iowa. So, his plan already rides heavily on having strong numbers in Iowa especially. So, this certainly dovetails nicely with that plan.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It also dovetails nicely that he won Iowa precisely because he sunk so much money into campaigning there. Coupled with the fact that Biden barely met the 15% threshold so Biden's voters were forced to choose Pete.
</p>

<p>
	If Biden under-performed it makes sense that Pete over-performed. Biden voters are not going to Bernie by and large.
</p>

<p>
	You are interpreting things in accordance with your biases. There are far less nefarious explanations of what happened.

			So, what I’m saying is that Pete is benefiting from the app malfunctioning in the sense that they are releasing the results gradually (in the districts that Pete was stronger in), and releasing the results from areas with more delegates that Bernie was stronger in.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	If Pete actually had a victory, then Pete is hurting from the app malfunction the most because he badly needed a clear victory because he's not going to win New Hampshire or Nevada or South Carolina most likely. Pete's only real chance of beating Bernie was to get a clear victory in Iowa. Bernie didn't need a clear victory as badly as Pete because Bernie should get a clear victory in New Hampshire and elsewhere. And Bernie has endless support and donations.
</p>

<p>
	If you were a Pete supporter, you would be pissed. Assuming Pete won. Which looks likely right now.
</p>

<p>
	If you sunk all of your money into one election, as Pete did, you need a clear victory there. So Pete is hurt the most by the situation as long as he didn't do anything fraudulent to cause it. I'm willing to give Pete the benefit of the doubt that he is not a totally corrupt fraud. If it turns out he is, well, he should go to jail for election rigging. But bring solid proof. That's a serious criminal charge. That's like calling someone a child molester. You better have proof. You don't call people child molesters just to be on the safe side. That's a highly damaging accusation.

<p>
	But not through a fraudulent vote counting system.
</p>

<p>
	There are laws against gross fraud like that.
</p>

<p>
	You can't just not count the votes of a black nominee because he's black, for example. That would never fly.
</p>

<p>
	If the DNC staged a fake app error in order to delay publishing the real results, that too would fall under fraud.
</p>

<p>
	It's clear that the app did not work as intended. Precinct captains had difficulty getting the app to download and work properly.

<p>
	I agree politicians shouldn't have conflicts of interest.
</p>

<p>
	But even to say that Pete is financially invested is a stretch. Buying services from a technology company is not to be invested in it. Companies routinely provide services to various clients.
</p>

<p>
	I'm pretty sure deliberately creating an vote counting system which misreports votes in favor of one candidate would be illegal. If a campaign was caught doing that it would be a massive scandal, there would be legal charges, and the entire election would be nullified.
</p>

<p>
	There is no evidence for any of that.
</p>

<p>
	To suggest Pete paid $50,000 to buy the election via a corrupt app is absurd. You better have solid evidence when making such a claim instead of saying "Err on the side of caution." You are erring on the side of slander.

They have done it already.
</p>

<p>
	America is not going to magically leap-frog Northern Europe with some utopian system. First we must reach Northern European levels, then we could innovate further. Northern Europe still has private property. And even Northern Europe is facing nationalist backlash. So they are struggling just to maintain stage Green without falling back down to Orange or Blue.
</p>

<p>
	What we need is to focus on is raising the bulk of the populace from Blue & Orange into Green. That is very practical and we know we can do that. We know what that looks like. It is not communism or even full socialism. It is social democracy a la Northern Europe.

<p>
	My priority is truth, not survival.
</p>

<p>
	What you are doing is projecting and speculating wildly.
</p>

<p>
	Pete had his people in every polling location. Bernie had his people in only 60% of polling locations. So it's reasonable that Pete's internal numbers are more accurate than Bernie's.
</p>

<p>
	Either way it seems the election was very close for both of them. The difference is not material. They seem to both be winners here. The fact that you don't like Pete on ideological grounds is irrelevant. Pete clearly got a lot of votes and that makes sense because Biden and Klobuchar were not viable in many polling locations, so of course they went to Pete, not Bernie.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie is still winning the popular vote, so I don't know what you guys are bitching about. Bernie had a great night and it's actually very good for Bernie that Pete basically killed Biden. Bernie should be able to defeat Pete going forward. Biden was the biggest threat to Bernie. If the DNC was rigging the election they would do it in favor of Biden as he was the frontrunner and has strong black support. The whole theory of rigging here makes on sense. You can't rig Pete's support. Moderates clearly support him.
</p>

<p>
	By denying Pete his votes you are being anti-Democratic. Notice that. You have to admit that many moderates just don't like Bernie. That's not rigging, that a problem for your progressive ideology which you have to cope with. Just because you like Bernie doesn't mean he should win.
</p>

	The point is not just that capitalism was necessary at one point in the distant past, but that it is still important today. At least parts of it are.
</p>

<p>
	Abolishing private property is not going to work in practice. Things can sound nice in theory but that doesn't mean it will work.
</p>

<p>
	When most humans in society are stage Blue and Orange, private property is necessary. Even if everyone was stage Green private property would still be necessary.
</p>

<p>
	One of the problems with Marxism from day 1 was that its ideals were way too advanced for the people's development level. Maybe if 80% of the population was Turquiose then you could get by without private property, but that will take another 1000 years to reach. And even that is questionable.
</p>

<p>
	As long as the political quiz is not some scam to harvest user data. Be careful with those. Lots of scammy quizzes on the net. Don't be a sucker for them.

<p>
	I eat quite a lot of raw honey. Probably 1 jar per week.
</p>

<p>
	Not sure how healthy it is. I like to believe it's healthy. Of course 1 jar/week is nowhere near enough to live off of. It would be quite gross to only eat honey all day. Makes me want to vomit just thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
	And I would also worry about pesticides when eating that much.
</p>

<p>
	Good honey is also expensive.
</p>

<p>
	But it makes for a nice quick energy-boosting snack.

<p>
	Of course it would be nice if all voting was federally administered with the full resources of the federal government rather than some Iowa hillbillies.
</p>

<p>
	But they say they have a solid paper trail. If that's true, I wouldn't worry about it.

	Wouldn't surprise me at all. Companies use sub-contractors all the time.

<p>
	It is also not developed by a trillion dollar company.
</p>

<p>
	They probably outsourced this app to some Indian developers for $10,000.
</p>

<p>
	People are used to software developed by trillion dollars companies which functions flawlessly (and even that's not true), then they complain about some locally developed mom-and-pop shop app.
</p>

<p>
	Have you seen how many buggy apps there are on the App stores?

<p>
	Post 'em here.

<p>
	Positive and negative are inseparable.

<p>
	Just want to remind everyone: this thread has a lot of silly and negative examples of Blue because they are flashy, funny, and all-too-easy to find. (I'm guilty of this.) But there are also many healthy and positive examples of Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get the idea that Blue is always idiotic. Without Blue, civilization would collapse.
</p>

<p>
	This too is stage Blue:

<p>
	Apple and Microsoft, both trillion dollar companies, release software updates which break their whole system and require immediate patches.
</p>

<p>
	And you expect some rinky-dink Iowa app to not have bugs?
</p>

<p>
	This is a joke, not evidence of rigging.
</p>

<p>
	Alternative media's vision is way too clouded by their hatred of the establishment and desire for Bernie to win. Textbook definition of projection and confirmation bias.
</p>

<p>
	The mind only sees evidence which validates its ideology.
</p>

<p>
	If you would only be willing to admit that's true: you don't know, and if you were patient, you'd get to the truth of the matter. But the ego-mind isn't interested in truth, it's interested in survival. And thus evil is born. Your mind is the source of the evil you decry. But you are too busy surviving to see it.
</p>

<p>
	And you wonder why there's so much evil in the world. Look in the mirror, if you dare.
</p>
