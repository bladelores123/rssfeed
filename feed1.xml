			Youtube does have an OBVIOUS agenda when it comes to the trending tab. It favours traditional media and late night shows, while often neglecting independent content creators.

	</div>

<p>
	Obviously.
</p>

<p>
	This is not because big media is paying them. This is because YT wants to serves up more authoritative sources and smaller fringe independent creators are less trustworthy. YT can safely assume that CNN or MSNBC will not serve up racist content. YT cannot assume that about small creators who could be Neo-Nazis or the like. Even with PewDiePie vs Jimmy Fallon, YT can trust Jimmy Fallon a lot more than PewDiePie not to say some racist or false shit.
</p>

<p>
	The bigger YT gets, the more mainstream it must be because mainstream is the only way to sustain the largest viewership numbers.
</p>

<p>
	Google's search algorithm does the same thing with websites. Google heavily favors mainstream authoritative sources vs no-name indie blogs. Because mainstream sources can be trusted as having some kind of journalistic standards.
</p>

<p>
	If Google did not do this, it's algorithm would quickly be gamed by spammers, hackers, and the scum of the internet.
</p>

<p>
	Most normies have no clue how scummy the internet is. Google serves up a highly sanitize version of the internet after filtering out 90% of the scum.
</p>

<p>
	Google's search algorithm literally has a list of the top 1000 sites that Google hand-selected as authoritative sources. And this list seeds the authority of the entire internet basically. Any links coming from those 1000 sources determine the authority of every webpage on the entire internet.
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness is imagining everything. Just like how a white sheet of paper holds whatever is drawn on it.
</p>

<p>
	You can have all sorts of mystical experiences of aliens, out of body, astral realms, chakras, etc.
</p>

<p>
	But all of it is happening within Nothingness. All of it is Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	No-self is a higher degree of consciousness than an OBE or a formed mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	The highest realization is that you have no form whatsoever. There is no reason to get out of your body because you were never in your body to begin with. You are omnipresent. You cannot go anywhere because you are already everywhere and everywhere is nowhere and nothing.
</p>

<title>What Do You Think Of Feminism?</title>

			Feminism, pick up, socialism, conservativism, MRAs, right extremists... At some point you gotta ask yourself what's the point of using all these terms though, when there are so huge diversity in how these words are used and perceived. Like, if I tell a crowd of 20 people that I'm a "feminist" or that I do "pick up ", and those 20 people have totally different definitions/views on those terms, wouldn't it then be better if I said " I'm a huge believer of equal rights and I feel like we still have a long way to go" or " I really enjoy approaching girls and getting to share my authentic self and by that giving both her and my self a pleasant experience which could potentially lead to something more"? It would obviously make the communication more clear at least.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Congrats! You've discovered the trade-off between brevity and clarity.
</p>

<p>
	"I'm a huge believer of equal rights and I feel like we still have a long way to go" << even if you said that every time instead of "feminism" you'd still be stuck with a lack of clarity. Now you'd have to define "equal rights" and "a long way to go".
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you in order to get full clarity you would have to define every single term in your entire worldview/mind. But you'd be dead before then. And still, people would misunderstand you because they lack your reference experiences used to define the terms.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is a slippery beast. Which is why this stuff gets argued about for ages without resolution.
</p>

<p>
	It's called a rabbit hole for a reason. It works like a funnel. You start watching Joe Rogan talk about comedy. Then you watch him interview Jordan Peterson. Then you go to Jordan Peterson's channel. Then you start getting anti-SJW content. Then you start getting racist stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You're not understanding how this works.
</p>

<p>
	YT isn't doing it. YOUR MIND is doing it because every mind is interested in validating its existing worldview.
</p>

<p>
	YT is just a mirror of your own mind. It serves you up what your mind wants to watch.
</p>

<p>
	I never get racist stuff on my screens and I've been using YT for 8 years.

	If racists stuff shows up on your screen it's because you were clicking on racist garbage.

<p>
	Being nice to minorities is a systemic and cultural issue more so than a personal one. No one cares if you're an asshole as a person. The issue that people care about most is systemic inequality and bullying, which is baked into the culture.

<p>
	Actually, demanding conservatives not to be dicks to minorities has little collateral damage.

<p>

<p>
	It's reasonably health and necessary. I don't see how else you do it. It's not like conservatives and racists are gonna admit wrong-doing or change their way of life unless some pressure is applied. The whole point of conservatives is that they will resist ANY change whatsoever. That's their game. And then they justify it with whatever excuses sound good to them.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes to get a bully to understand that his bullying is bad, you must give him a taste of his own medicine. The problem is that a bully doesn't understand that his bullying hurts others until he feels the hurt reflected back on him by those he hurt.
</p>

<p>
	So when a racist is publicly shamed or deplatformed, it hurts him, and then he gets a taste of what it feels like to be bullied as a minority.
</p>

<p>
	See, racists used to be a majority who bullied the minority, but now they are starting to become the minority who gets bullied by the majority, and this scares the shit out of them. It creates an existential crises of them.
</p>

<p>
	The tables have turned and the racists and devils are getting hoisted by their own petards. That's the problem with devilry -- it always boomerangs.

<p>
	That's precisely why there needs to be a stronger federal government with much better funding and strict protocols in place as soon as a new virus hits.
</p>

<p>
	This virus is directly the result of libertarian-like approach to government: let's just do nothing and the free market will fix itself.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds nice in theory, but in practice leads to mass death and economic horror.

<p>

<p>
	So by your logic, in the Civil War, the North was fascist against the South.
</p>

<p>
	And during the Civil Rights movement in the 60's, black people were fascist against white people.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the whole trick with building a good society is that selfish people have to be forcibly restrained or at least shamed from being selfish because a selfish person will not do so of his own recognizance.

<p>
	Sometimes equality gotta be forced.

At this point it's basically become the default method of information exchange for so many millions of people that the corporation has become incredibly powerful in terms of controlling what people's eyeballs see. I mean I guess they're doing a good enough job as it is, but at the same time some sort of regulations could ensure that it doesn't abuse its power for one malicious end or another?

<p>
	Yes, of course all massively popular social media platforms need government regulation and oversight.
</p>

<p>
	The feds could set up an "online media court" which handles cases like that of YT vs Stefan Molyneux or Alex Jones, where an impartial and well-educated panel of judges adjudicates whether community guidelines were violated or not, and the whole thing can be aired live on YT for all citizens to see. This would be a huge win for liberal democracy, free speech, and civil rights.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to ban people as long as the process of getting banned is fair and transparent, and the person has an ability to defend himself against strawman arguments or being taken out of context.

<p>
	It's more complicated than that. Because conservatives still fundamentally believe that being a man or a woman is "real", "objective", and "scientific" while other identities are not.
</p>

<p>
	The real issue here is how many trans and gay teens end up killing themselves because they get bullied, harassed, and mocked for their sexual identity/preferences.
</p>

<p>
	If conservatives stop mocking and bullying trans and gay people, then there won't be a big issue about pronouns and the like.
</p>

<p>
	See, this is being framed by conservatives as if trans people are oppressing them, when really it's mostly about conservatives who want the freedom to bully trans and gay people.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, government is going to take away your freedom to bully and mock people of different sexual identities. Sorry. You're not gonna win that battle.

<p>
	Nudity is also against TOS for obvious reasons. Millions of kids use YT.
</p>

<p>
	YT does not promote racist or sexist stuff. It is against their TOS and YT just banned a bunch of big racists channels. Moderating such stuff is very challenging. Overall YT is doing a good job, considering how many thousands of new videos are uploaded each minute to YT.

<p>
	Youtube is a technology platform. It doesn't "welcome" anything. It is not Youtube's job to micromanage the content that people upload. All that YT asks is that people don't upload hateful, racist, sexist, toxic, violent, illegal stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Joe Rogan has one of the biggest audiences in the world. It's his responsibility to vet for dangerous clowns and ideologues. Most of Rogan's audience is not even on YT.

	Conservatives should legit fear the loss of their worldview, identity, and the ensuing existential crises that will come with that. Of course all of this is good stuff, but they don't want to hear it.

	Certainly a stage Red sort of mentality.

<p>
	Undermining of one's identity is never benign. It's a matter of life and death. Which is why conservatives are so triggered by it.
</p>

<p>
	Something as innocent as admitting that a human could legitimately consider herself a unicorn is actually a very troubling thing for the conservative ego-mind. If she could be a unicorn, who am I then?

<p>
	Hunting is not about the joy of killing. Hunting is about the thrill of the hunt.
</p>

<p>
	Rogan hunts his own meat and says he doesn't buy meat from the store. In which case he's not killing any more than a non-hunter kills.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly Rogan exhibits stage Red and Orange to some degree. Mostly he's pretty healthy about it from what I can tell. He's not a toxic guy. He has a good heart. But I feel his audience can be easily mislead down an alt-right rabbit hole. It's easier to convince his audience that men and women are objective biological facts rather than that men and women are socially constructed and relative categories. A lot of his audience does not understand or appreciate stage Green, which is why bringing on people like JP, Sam Harris, the Weinsteins's, Dave Rubin, Tim Pool, Alex Jones, etc. is so problematic.

<p>
	A powerful technique they teach life coaches is called Validation. It works like this:
</p>

<p>
	Whenever a client introduces some new problem or challenge he's facing, you as the coach hear it out and say:
</p>

<p>
	Coach: "How does that make you feel?"
</p>

<p>
	Client: Explains feelings
</p>

<p>
	Coach: "How do you REALLY feel about?"
</p>

<p>
	Client: Explains even deeper feelings
</p>

<p>
	Coach: "I hear you say you really feel X because of Y. It's valid to feel that way because..."
</p>

	Rogan has many male followers from UFC & MMA, which are low on the Spiral and so they will skew a lot to the right, even though Rogan himself is Green.
</p>

<p>
	This is why Rogan's platforming of alt-righters is so problematic. It's the perfect bait for his vulnerable audience, but Rogan isn't aware of this because he's just flying by the seat of his pants.

<p>
	All identity is relative, subjective, and self-constructed.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you think you are, you're imagining that. Whether you think you're a human, a 30 year old male, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you feel some of these identities are more real and less constructed is because society happens to reinforce your imaginary identity.
</p>

<p>
	So, for example, if you were born into a society/culture which believed that all humans are aliens, you would identify as an alien and you would feel that this is your true biological identity.
</p>

<p>
	Your actual identity is Nothing. Which allows you to pretend to be whoever you want. But the added wrinkle is... since you are addicted to the approval and authority of your culture, you only tend to take seriously those identities which your culture says are valid and real. So when some college kid tells you that she's a unicorn, you think that's stupid. Because your culture tells you that people cannot be unicorns.
</p>

<p>
	Who is right? No one. It's all relative.

<p>
	Vaush is definitely over-blowing the whole Nazi/white supremacist/fascist angle.
</p>

<p>
	These people are right-wing. But right-wing has plenty of degrees and they should not all be equated with Nazis just because they have nationalist and ethnocentric predilections. Most people in the world are simply not evolved enough yet to be cosmopolitan. That doesn't make them Nazis. Calling such people Nazis makes the situation worse as they don't think of themselves as Nazis and they start to feel righteous in resisting progressives. "How can progressives be right when they keep calling me and my friends Nazis when we clearly aren't? Therefore progressives must be wrong."
</p>

<p>
	In his desire to be edgy Vaush is weakening his otherwise solid position.

<p>
	Libertarianism is good against a severe authoritarian state, perhaps like that in China.
</p>

<p>
	But libertarians always act as though the government is oppressing them -- no matter what size government is -- so they cry wolf even about sensible regulations which are not really oppressive.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like Medicare For All and Green New Deal and Civil Rights is not oppressive or authoritarian. It benefits the vast majority of people. Yet libertarians will oppose it. So they become useful idiots for corporations and plutocrats who want as little regulation and public services as possible.

	It seems that way to you because you watch too much right-wing media.

<p>
	The entire point of right-wing media is to make Green seem as toxic as possible -- because then we don't have to evolve.

<p>
	To be fair, there is a progressive rabbit hole as well.
</p>

<p>
	The only difference is, the progressive one is much less toxic and actually helps advance society to the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	But progressive/Green ideology and group-think is still a thing. So be careful. If you watch too much progressive YT, you will develop blindspots.

<p>
	Paradox only arises when you try to grasp Oneness using a dualistic mind.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, you keep trying to put reality into relative boxes when it is absolutely unboxed.
</p>

<p>
	It is the same problem as when you try to map the Earth onto a flat square. The result is always distorted and full of seams which don't exist on the Earth itself.

	Here's an example of the common libertarian mistake of thinking that local government is better and less oppressive/corrupt than centralized government. The caller fundamentally misunderstands issues of scale and the fact that local gov is MORE corrupt due to its self-biased nature.

<p>
	Careful, technology will not save us or make us more conscious. Technology does not have consciousness of itself. Each stage will use new technology to advance its survival agenda, just as the internet is used by far right stage Blue nationalists or nuclear weapons could be used by stage Red terrorists. AI can be abused by lower stages. We're already starting to see it with deepfakes.

	More accurately he is a vain, incompetent, sociopath, narcissist, demagogue, opportunist with no principles or philosophy of any kind other than self-aggrandizement.
</p>

<p>
	To be a proper fascist he would have to care about some communal goal beyond his own personal aggrandizement. He's both too selfish and too lazy to care about such a goal. And even if he overcame that, he would be too ignorant and incompetent to execute it.

		<p>
			Yes I appreciate they are in unique situations and their hands are tied, but you have to understand the reason people even use such language as "criminal" (even if it is recklessly applied sometimes) is to push back and challenge the systems that justify and rationalize those acts, and to expand our standards of what is acceptable behavior and what isn't.

<p>
	Presidents make all sorts of decisions that people will disagree with it. That does not a criminal make.
</p>

<p>
	My defense is not semantic. It's fundamental. Presidents are given serious life and death situations and decisions to deal with. If you start calling them criminals willy-nilly because they seem too harsh, that's your misunderstanding of the challenges and complexities of governing a nation of 330 million people.
</p>

<p>
	You can question and criticize their decisions without resorting to falsehoods and hyperbole.
</p>

<p>
	You can disagree with Obama without calling him a criminal. Calling him a criminal weakens your argument by making you look ignorant, reactionary, and sloppy.
</p>

<p>
	Making life and death decisions for a president is not a crime. It's the job!

<p>
	To call a president or politician a criminal is silly because the job itself just has serious consequences no matter who holds it.
</p>

<p>
	If you think Obama and Biden are criminals, you have no appreciation of what a truly corrupt person in such a position of power would be like.
</p>

<p>
	A few drone strikes is peanuts in the grand scheme of things and does not a criminal make. Obama is probably the least criminal a politician as has ever held serious office.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful with your liberal fantasies of how politicians and presidents should be angels. They can't be angels because they are in the business of fighting off monsters and devils. An angel would never get the job.
</p>

<p>
	When you are president, even a small decision could easily end up hurting or killing thousands of people. And often times your decisions are like this:
</p>

<p>
	Plan A: 1,000 people die
</p>

<p>
	Plan B: 100,000 people die
</p>

<p>
	There is no Plan C.

<p>
	It's similar to Silicon Valley. They are Green on social/culture issues, and Orange on economic and metaphysical issues.
</p>

<p>
	A capitalist is much more threatened by relinquishing Orange values on economics, metaphysics, and epistemology than they are in being pro-gay, pro-women, pro-minority. It doesn't cost Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Tesla, etc much to be Green on social/cultural issues. But it costs them tens of billions to give up Orange economics.
</p>

<p>
	The engine that runs most universities is still Orange capitalism/materialism. With a Green outer shell.

			Interesting idea. I don't know of many lower-ranked employees who would like to share the loss margins if the higher-ups mess up though. Would this require them to invest in the stocks of their company too?

		<p>
			It will take immense levels of trust between people. It could work. I'd say it's worth a shot.

<p>
	I think the most you'd stand to lose is your share of future profits and your job.
</p>

<p>
	The low level employees would not invest their own money. They would be given the share of ex-employees who left the company.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the company would constantly be reallocating shares based on who's working, how much work they do, and how valuable their work is. If you leave the company, you lose all your shares. If the company makes no profit, you gain no bonus, but you still get a base salary. If the company goes bankrupt you lose your job and your shares.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the point is to make sure that no one who isn't working in the company can buy shares. Only workers should be allowed to have a share of the profits, not outside speculators or Wall Street wolves.
</p>

<p>
	The billion dollar question I have is this: is it possible to entirely abolish Wall Street? Or does Wall Street actually serve a necessary role? Could we construct a society and economy in which Wall Street's role would be made completely obsolete? I'm not sure, but it's a question worth seriously exploring.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it should be obvious now why the people in power absolutely HATE this idea and will do everything in their power not to even consider it as a possibility. Those in power primarily thrive off the labor of others, yet they MUST deny this in their own minds.
</p>

	There are pros and cons to each location. And it depends a lot on where you live. Some cities are great for daygame while others are not. Some clubs and bars are shit, some are amazing. You can't beat a Vegas nightclub pool party for game. XS on Sunday nights in the spring and summer is just paradise. Los Angeles, Miami, NYC is great for daygame.
</p>

<p>
	Finding good locations is crucial to your success. Invest a lot of time finding the best locations.

<p>
	I think it could work the way pirate ships worked. The pirate ship was basically a co-op model. But it wasn't flat. It had hierarchy and strong leadership, but every pirate, even the greenhorn, would get a percentage share of all the loot.
</p>

<p>
	So, the captain might get 1/3 share.
</p>

<p>
	His lieutenants might get 1/15th share.
</p>

<p>
	And the lowest greenhorn sailor might get 1/100th share.
</p>

<p>
	As you rise up the ranks and gain more experience and responsibility, your share increases.
</p>

<p>
	This all basically boils down to how ownership and spoils get distributed.
</p>

<p>
	The federal gov could basically mandate that each corporation with over 10, 50, or 100 employees must adopt this share model or face heavy fines/taxes.
</p>

<p>
	1) Green must build on top of the accomplishments of Orange, not outright reject them. The difficulty is figuring out which aspects of Orange to ditch and which to keep. There is no simple answer to that question.
</p>

<p>
	2) Just cause it's Green doesn't make it more effective. Green's metrics for success are different than Orange. Green is more about relationship and community than raw productive output. Hippies aren't exactly well-known for their effectiveness. But, hey, maybe that's a better way to measure biz effectiveness.

<p>
	I honestly don't know if it would be a disaster or an triumph. It's hard to predict. It needs empirical testing.
</p>

<p>
	The whole trick with new social systems is that no one can really predict ahead of time whether they will work. It requires experimentation and fine-tuning in an evolutionary manner.

	That is the case with any chemical. Psychedelics affect people very differently.

<p>
	It's all one big arc. So yes.
</p>

<p>
	Even just with using one substance, your first 5-MeO trip will be very different from your 20th. The chemical is less of a factor than your mind's development is.

<p>
	1) They promise you a quick and easy awakening.
</p>

<p>
	2) They don't understand crazy levels of awakening at all, since they have not attained them.
</p>

<p>
	So they're misleading you in two ways at once. They both oversell and undersell Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not talking about changes in character. I'm talking about consciousness.

<p>
	Don't trust any neo-advaitan who claims enlightenment can be had quickly and easily. It's fools gold. It will not work. They cherrypick their successes and bury their failures. It's very dishonest and manipulative, giving newbies a false sense of hope.

<p>

	There are different kinds of populism at different stages.

<p>
	Green populism is very different from Blue populism.
</p>

<p>
	Blue populism is nationalistic, ethnocentric, racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-minority, anti-feminist, anti-relativist. Fascistic.

<p>
	Yeah, the Trump admin is full of libertarian-leaning folks, and yet Trump would not hesitate to become an authoritarian. That's the trick. You assume there is some kind of integrity to these right-wing ideologies when there isn't. They are opportunistic, selfish, and power-hungry. As the naive libertarians weaken the state, that allows an authoritarian boss to swoop in and fill the power vacuum. Libertarians become the useful idiots of serious fascists and authoritarians.

<p>
	Once you've attracted her, you will have a lot of leeway. You can be nice or you can be an asshole and she will stick around in both cases most of the time.
</p>

<p>
	But if you are an asshole, eventually she will leave after much suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why ethics are so important. Women are too easily exploited this way by guys. They fall for assholes too easily. Guys need to be taught how not to mistreat women.

<title>Vaush on Fascism</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Careful though about framing this as the good guys vs the enemy. The problem is that Vaush is polarizing his listeners too much, making them see the right-wing as "the enemy". This will make it impossible to govern half the country.
</p>

<p>
	Of course most right-wingers are not consciously, intentionally fascist. But their ideology makes it easy for them to become soft supports of fascist leaders. Trump has a 90% approval rating in his own party, which is a very troubling sign. So while most right wingers will never explicitly say they support fascism, many of them can be fooled into voting a fascist into office because they have nationalist sympathies and the culture wars can be used to trick them into voting for those who will own those scary crazy Libs. 
</p>

<p>
	Fascists love to pander to and stoke up the natural ethnocentric fears that roughly half of any given country has. Propaganda channels like Fox News will stroke up these fears to the point where otherwise moderate folks become confused and start acting to defend against those fears.
</p>

Slavery was practiced locally by most peoples all over the world. And of course Africans enslaved each other too.

<p>
	Go read Wikipedia article on the history of slavery.

<p>
	So now you understand how a slaverowner feels justified in keeping slaves.
</p>

<p>
	Slavery is purely practical. No one engages in slavery to be deliberately cruel. Free labor is simply a highly practical thing.

<title>Vaush on Fascism</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	So I've been listening a lot to Vaush over the last week and although he is overly edgy and overly stuck in Green, he's got some pretty astute and brilliant insight into certain aspects of politics.
</p>

<p>
	I found the following video particularly insightful:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XI9QlY_nNo?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Vaush is making me think more deeply about what fascism really entails and how sneaky it is. And while I still think he over-uses that term, I'm also starting to see an undeniable slippery slope between right-wing populism and fascism.
</p>

<p>
	Is there really such as thing as right-wing populism which will not devolve into xenophobia, racism, and authoritarianism? I'd like to think so, but I'm not as certain of that as I used to be. These new right-wing populists can be very sneaky with their messaging. After all, if someone was a true populist why wouldn't he support someone like Bernie or AOC? Right-wing populists are nationalists first and populists second. Otherwise they'd be left-wing populists.
</p>

<p>
	Anyways... just some food for thought.
</p>

<p>
	If you overlook Vaush's excessive edginess and hyperbole, he has some of the most sophisticated political analysis I've seen on YT.
</p>

<p>
	You are literally saying that higher stages of the Spiral are more dangerous than lower stages.
</p>

<p>
	You saying that -- is what is most dangerous, as you give defense to nationalist propaganda during a time of rising nationalism.
</p>

<p>
	Left wing ideology will never be as dangerous as right wing ideology.

<p>
	While it's true that women have fears of sexual assault and so-on that men do not, it's absurd to say that women fear more than men.
</p>

<p>
	Most men are full of fear. A woman doesn't even understand what fear is until she's experienced what it's like for a guy to cold approach a hot girl and try to attract her.
</p>

<p>
	Most men are super insecure and fearful. Fear is fundamental to all living organisms. Women do not have some special monopoly on fear.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is fundamental to the ego-mind. So it's not about male or female. The more ego the more fear.
</p>

	LP by day, pickup by night.
</p>

<p>
	Move to a bigger city when you can afford it.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, pickup doesn't have to take up your whole day. You can go out for 2-3 hours every Fri, Sat, Sun. You can do day game in the afternoons on weekends.

<p>
	There's no solution to this other than finding another girl.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is not a conscious choice. You do not choose what you get attracted to.
</p>

<p>
	She herself cannot satisfy her own standards for you. She will certainly not be turned on by any random guy.
</p>

<p>
	It's your responsibility as a man to screen girls hard right off the bat to meet your attractiveness standards. Stop settling for mediocre girls. By not screening harder you are doing a disservice to the girl, since you won't be passionate about her.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	I'm open to it. We need to move in that direction. But unlike most socialists I'm not naive enough to think that it will all just auto-magically work without leadership. Co-ops will need leadership.
</p>

<p>
	We need more co-ops, but we need more conscious, visionary leadership too.

	I'm extremely skeptical of any flat-hierarchy organizations. If they worked, they would have been done from day one. The problem is they are inefficient and directionless. Design by committee doesn't work so well. Majority of people are lazy, ignorant, stupid, and without vision or ambition.

	If 40mg vaped didn't show him God, plugging won't either. He clearly has a massive tolerance to it.

I don't see the appeal of that.
</p>

<p>
	I'd rather take a pure clean hit of DMT via a simple oil pipe. Oil pipe works excellent. Yes, it can be fucking intense if you dose too high. So dose low. You can always redose and keep a steady high going.

Libertarians usually don't give a damn about racism, since most of them lean right-wing. And a libertarian would tend to argue that math and logic are absolute truths since libertarians do not understand relativity.

	Plugging is far more precise than vaping. You never know if you vaporized or inhaled the full dose. With plugging you get the full thing every time.

</p>

<p>
	Thanks for sharing.
</p>

<p>
	A few tips:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Stop using 5-MeO and switch to DMT. If DMT is more profound and mystical for you, why aren't you using it more? You need to find the chem that works for you. If 40mg of vaped 5-MeO-DMT don't clearly show you God, then it's not the right chem for you.
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't hide your stuff in a book. That's the first place anyone would look. Be more clever.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is not as challenging for me as DMT or salvia.
</p>

<p>
	Although by the 25th day of 5-MeO, things got pretty hairy and I was starting to lose my mind.

<p>
	Sure, slaves probably feel oppressed.
</p>

<p>
	But the point is that the slave masters don't feel they are doing anything wrong. They feel entitled to having slaves in the same way that you feel entitled to eating plants and animals. You don't feel you're doing anything wrong when you eat a carrot. Neither does a slave master.

	A) That's still all relative.
</p>

<p>
	B) Humans can only raise their consciousness like that through education and cultural evolution, which requires massive social infrastructure. You can't have the majority of humans become conscious enough to realize that slavery is selfish without first building a massive government which educates them about such things and provides them systems, regulations, and controls to meet their selfish needs in more kind ways.

	Fundamentally, no two communities can remain isolated from each other. It's always only a matter of time before they start to bump into each other, cross-pollinate, and merge.
</p>

<p>
	It is impossible for two villages to simply live near each other without interaction. And much of that interaction will not be voluntary or lovely. Libertarians fundamentally do not understand this.

<p>
	Psychedelics are so powerful that you will never get used to giant doses. You're not going to out-macho psychedelics. They will always kick your ass if you take too much. So be careful. Infinite Consciousness is not a thing to be trifled with.
</p>

<p>
	I find high doses of DMT downright terrifying. It's too much consciousness for a human to handle.

<p>
	We are not going to discuss Red Pill here.
</p>

<p>
	Red Pill will not get you laid, it will just corrupt your mind with negativity and anger.
</p>

<p>
	To get good with women you must be positive and constructive. Blaming women for your problems is the last thing you wanna do. Women are amazing when you learn how to interact with them properly. You should be looking to create win-win situations.

<p>
	Here's a good list of tips for you newbies:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hmfdu7/the_most_common_mistakes_guys_make_in_the_field/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hmfdu7/the_most_common_mistakes_guys_make_in_the_field/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes the best pickup advice you will find written as simple online posts by anonymous guys who clearly hit the field. There's tons of this stuff available online.
</p>

<p>
	Look for guys who sound like they spend a lot of time in the field, and take notes on their tips and top lessons. Then follow those as you hit the field yourself. That's basically how you learn game in a nutshell. It's not very fancy or complicated. You just need to figure out the top 20 or 30 principles and practice them religiously.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most valuable parts of RSD was their forum, with Field Reports and advanced practitioners posting their highest lessons and tips. That alone was enough to learn game. Too bad it's all gone now. But you can find other online sources.
</p>

I would always choose the most conscious candidate from my pov and I assume everyone else would do the same from their povs. But how could we get to agree to have a similar pov?

<p>
	It's pretty easy to see who is more conscious if you are doing consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	Or just rely on Spiral Dynamics as a rough guide.
</p>

<p>
	Of course most people will be biased in favor of their fave candidate.

	Gilded Age was not libertarian. It was just a lack of anti-trust regulation.

<p>
	I just intuitively felt the entire pickup culture was low-consciousness and toxic from the moment I visited their forums. But I also knew that they had solid dating advice, and these two things are separate. There is nothing wrong with techniques and theory in itself. It just needs to be used responsibly with compassion for the woman.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to business. You can learn business techniques which can be applied ethically to benefit your customers or unethically to exploit your customers.

<p>
	The deeper issue here is this: you interactions with women need to be obviously charged with sexual intent that if a woman pays you any compliment at whatsoever, she knows she's implicitly asking to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	You need to make it clear with the first 5 minutes of meeting a girl that this is not a friend-to-friend interaction.
</p>

<p>
	Julien was a juvenile idiot drunk on the power of RSD culture.
</p>

<p>
	This is the kind of thing I criticized in my A Rant Against The Pickup Community video.
</p>

<p>
	There was a fundamental lack of concern for the woman's feelings within RSD culture. Women were treated as disposable dogs. I clearly saw it as a problem just before this whole debacle with Julien blew up in his face.
</p>

<p>
	It all could have been avoided if Owen put some emphasis on ethics. The selfishness was just off the charts within RSD culture. It became toxic.
</p>

<p>
	But that's exactly what happens when you democratize and flatten hierarchies, as Green is into doing. You will get a mob rule effect. The mob will require people to conform to its values.

	Just ground yourself in ordinary life, take it easy, and let time pass.
