<p>
	There are just far too many higher quality sources you could be learning from.
</p>

<p>
	Gotta be wise with how you allocate your time.

Truthful insights can be hard for the ego to accept. If you're doing psychedelics the one thing you can know for sure is that they will reveal things about you & reality which you will find disturbing and uncomfortable.

<p>
	Can you delude yourself? Always! Delusion has been your way of life since your imaginary birth.

Of course I have no idea how you will handle it psychologically.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like you're fairly tolerant to it, so even up to 40mg might be required. But go slow.
</p>

<p>
	With 5-MeO-DMT there are actually several levels of breakthrough. The first breakthrough is just the beginning (child's play really).
</p>

<p>
	I might get a breakthrough at 20mg but then a crazy new kind of breakthrough at 30mg.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you're still far off from that.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, freebase seems more potent per volume.

<title>Is Jordan Peterson having a middle life crisis?</title>

</p>

<p>
	JP certainly does not know what Truth is. Neither does Sam Harris.
</p>

<p>
	JP's discussion about Truth with Sam Harris is a joke. Two blind men arguing about an elephant they've never seen.
</p>

<p>
	If JP just simply taught Jungian psychology, that would be fine. But he sticks his nose in all sorts of other issues outside his understanding. He speaks about Marxism, for example, without any sign of having read or studied Marx.
</p>

<p>
	Technically, "cultural Marxism" is a conspiracy theory which long predates JP.

</p>

<p>
	This is but one example.
</p>

<p>
	Folks who end up following JP don't have enough intellectual rigor and education to understand the strawmen which JP puts up and then knocks down.

	That's where he is weakest. He is a dualist. He does not understand what meaning is, what a symbol is, what science is, what religion is, what God is, what language is, what consciousness, what morality is, what evil is, what being is, what mind is, what body is, what thought is, what mysticisim is, what gender is, what ego is, what truth is.

<p>
	Again. Lol
</p>

<p>
	JP is being called out on his bullshit, devilry, and demonization of feminism, SJWs, socialism, Marxism, and Green.
</p>

<p>
	JP built his entire career demonizing Green. So please spare me the "poor JP" BS. 
</p>

<p>
	You guys still have a lot of growing up to do before you understand Green.
</p>

<p>
	I understand that JP cannot help being the devil that he is. So in the absolute sense I have love for him. But in the relative sense I will still call him out on his devilry because the ideology he spreads is dangerous and toxic.
</p>

<p>
	Do not expect me to be neutral towards devils just to placate you. I will call out devilry where I see it.

<p>
	You cannot successfully start something which you have not studied from the inside.

<p>
	Individualism vs collectivism is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Neither one is an absolute good. They must be balanced of course.
</p>

<p>
	But practically, in American society there is a massive cultural resistance to stage Green collectivism and over-glorification of individualism. Ironically this resistance is itself collective.
</p>

<p>
	So when I push people towards collectivism, it's not because I think collectivism is the end goal, it's because I'm trying to balance out the stage Orange libertarian and capitalist attitude which has lodged itself in the minds of many people today.
</p>

<p>
	It is a mistake to worry too much about the excesses of collectivism when right now our society is reeling from the excesses of individualism. So while you speak of balance, you're out of balance.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Sometimes reality is rude to one's fantasies.
</p>

<p>
	When we talk about conservatives we are talking in gross generalities. It is simply the case that *on average* the conservative mind is less developed and less conscious than the liberal mind. If you disagree with this, you need to make a deep study of the conservative mind and developmental psychology.
</p>

<p>
	This seems unfair to you -- I understand -- but you have to stop assuming false equivalencies.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a left vs right issue. This is consciousness issue.
</p>

<p>
	Again, you must be very careful not to project your self-bias onto what I'm saying. Your self-bias is going to make it seem like I am being self-biased. Don't confuse your self-bias with my own.
</p>

<p>
	All of this is extremely advanced stuff. It's extremely self-deceptive. I am not making partisan points here even though it might seem like I am. I am talking about meta things which, for the most part, no one on Earth understands or has ever talked about. It will take you years of study and consciousness work to understand the things I'm saying and why I say them.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This thread is not the best place for that discussion.
</p>

<p>
	In brief, I agree that Yang and Sanders should not be fighting each other. Nor are they. Their ideas largely dovetail. Sanders is too advanced even for the 21st century. We are nowhere near "passed that". We are just warming up. Yang is part of the warm up.
</p>

<p>
	Yang is not going after corporate corruption as directly as Sanders is. Yang's over-focused on UBI as a cure-all at the expense of a solid welfare system.

	Again, I am not opposed to Yang per se. If he were president that would be a huge step forward for America. But I see Bernie Sanders as an MLK or FDR type figure who can lead a true social movement unlike anyone else. He has the balls to do it. The status quo is most threatened by Sanders. Because they intuit that he will call out their selfishness and greed unlike anyone else.
</p>

<p>
	The polar opposite of Trump is not an Asian guy who knows math. It's Bernie Sanders -- who will attack the very heart of late-stage capitalism. This attack is badly needed to shift the center of gravity of our culture.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to discuss this further, start a dedicated thread.

<p>
	There is value in learning about masculine and feminine ways of life.
</p>

<p>
	But also, that is just one way to partitioning reality. So be careful not to get hung up on that daulity. It is a duality in the end.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness itself is not masculine or feminine. But from a human perspective it is useful to experiment with masculine vs feminine approaches to life and spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	A heart-centered, love-based path can be very powerful. But it also needs to grounded in direct realization of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Again, the problem is with how you're defining "I". The I of which you speak is the illusory ego.
</p>

<p>
	The true I, God, has an infinite number of lives because it is all things.
</p>

<p>
	Your life is imaginary. It isn't really yours. You've mistaken the universe for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like when you say, "This is my cat." But in truth, that cat does not belong to you. You can't really own a cat. Only in your imagination.

	It is a special kind of twisted devilry to promote animal welfare while calling for the extermination of Jews because they are varmints and cockroaches.

<p>
	Your question has a subtle duality as its premise.
</p>

<p>
	The "you" you're assuming in that question is the ego self. The ego is not the only one.
</p>

<p>
	That is the wrong you.
</p>

<p>
	The right you is God. God is the only thinker because it is all thinkers.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, there is no difference between actuality and your imagination. So if you imagine there are others out there, that's what God creates. Since you are God.
</p>

<p>
	You are imagining the very world you interact with. You are like a paranoid madman. If you believe people are chasing after you, they are!

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, causation is a dualistic notion. To have causation requires you divide the world into causes and effects (duality).
</p>

<p>
	To say there is no causation is the same as to say there is infinite causation, because zero and infinity are identical.
</p>

<p>
	Every object has an infinite chain of causes and an infnite chain of effects. Reality is an infnite fractal of cause and effect. Every point in the web is both the beginning, the center, and the end.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could say that everything is uncaused. It's the same thing.

<p>
	Because people are selfish and helping animals is outside their circle of concern.
</p>

<p>
	It does not serve a human's survival to help animals. So they mostly don't.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to care about animals when your belly is empty.
</p>

<p>
	We change this by raising collective consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	People only start caring about animals as beings at stage Green and above. Lower stages treat animals as walking resources.

<p>
	I think it's great.
</p>

<p>
	Of course they have a lot more growing to do in other areas, but hey, they're growing pretty quick for the Middle East. You gotta keep in mind that all growth is relative to one's starting point and geographic & historical situation. It is incorrect to judge Dubai by American or European standards. When you compare Dubai to Iraq or Saudi Arabia you see how great it is.
</p>

<p>
	When judging countries the key is less-so judging their absolute position but their rate of growth and willingness to change.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest problems in America is that our system has become so stubborn and resistant to change.

<title>Ken Wilber talks about politics.</title>

<p>
	He's critical of Green from above. And he's mostly talking about Green as it crops up in academia.
</p>

<p>
	I think the thing he's overlooking is that our national politics is nowhere near as advanced as academia politics.
</p>

<p>
	So while it makes sense to criticize Green academia from above, this creates confusion if people try to apply this more broadly to our national discourse. The national discourse is so regressive that it's got miles to go before it reaches solid Green. By over focusing on criticism of Green Ken might inadvertently play right into the hands of the status quo and the right-wing.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to not draw a false equivalency between stuff like Fox News and excesses of academia. Whatever criticism academia deserves, stuff like Fox News deserves x10 more.

	I kinda like the sound of "Society, Environment, Politics"

<p>
	And then those of you who aren't interested in that topic would see less of those threads in the Self-Actualization and Spirituality sub-forums.

	That's not a good method.
</p>

<p>
	Pick one of the following:
</p>

<p>
	1) Read your script word for word while your video shows various related imagery, not your face.
</p>

<p>
	2) Show your face but speak without a script. Speak naturally, the way you would to a friend. You could have an short outline of your key points just to keep you on track.

	What is the point of doing a job that a donkey could do?

<p>
	The whole point of machines and AI is free humans to be their most creative and artistic. But being creative and artistic requires serious development, sense of life purpose, and vision.
</p>

<p>
	Worrying about how to keep humans doing donkey-jobs is a disservice to humans. Show humans how to be fully human.

<title>Is Jordan Peterson having a middle life crisis?</title>

<p>
	The alt-lite and alt-right YT rabbit hole is well documented to radicalize young white males.
</p>

<p>
	Young white men who resonate with JP's victim complex will definitely be suseptible to alt-right ideology.
</p>

<p>
	He is unwittingly helping to radicalize people against liberals, progressives, women, social democrats, and LGBTQ.
</p>

<p>
	PragerU and FoxNews are right wing propaganda channels, and he appears in their videos.
</p>

<p>
	Like Trump, he knows not what his words are doing.
</p>

<p>
	The alt-right desperately needs intellectuals and academics to give them an air of credibility. He fits that role.
</p>

<p>
	He is a fool's idea of an intellectual, just like Trump is a fool's idea of a rich person.
</p>

<p>
	No they won't. This is a myth.
</p>

<p>
	The US used to have a 75%+ tax rate for rich people.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot currently move away from IRS taxation. If you are a US citizen even if you move overseas you still owe the IRS money. You can't just do a bunch of business in the US while living offshore as a citizen and not pay taxes.
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention that most desirable countries have fairly high taxes.

	Most young men who follow him have no idea about the Spiral, so they will not be able to discern the limitations of his worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, these young men use his worldview to deepen and justify their toxic masculinity and hatred of feminism, creating a gateway into the alt-right, incel-ism, RedPill, white supremacy, and all that jazz.

<p>
	To be clear, nothing wrong with a bit of fantasy as long as you understand it's a fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Since there's nothing but fantasy you might as well enjoy it a bit.

<p>
	Racism and reverse-racism are not equivalent. Likewise with feminism and toxic masculinity.

<p>
	Be careful with false equivalency. It's a very popular form of self-deception these days.

	Right now you are a devil. As a devil you suffer from the disconnection from God's Love. But you don't know how to stop being a devil. You're too scared to surrender your devilry.

<p>
	In other words, her and every other girl on the planet. LOL
</p>

<p>
	She's insecure that you'll leave her so she wants pretty stories about why she's special and why you'll never leave her.
</p>

<p>
	Of course don't tell her any of this, or she'll get upset. She doesn't want truth, she wants a fantasy. That's mostly what relationships are: mutually constructed fantasies of two people trying desperately to use one another to meet each others needs while desperately denying that this is what they're doing.
</p>

<p>
	Women don't like being complimented on their looks because they know that looks fade and there's always someone better looking around. They want to be complimented on unique personality traits.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta get more creative with your compliments.
</p>

<p>
	"I really like your pussy" is not a good compliment to a girl. Find unique things about her to compliment. Maybe even some of her flaws.

	Trump's wealth is fake. So unlike real billionaires, he probably actually needs the money to stay afloat.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is constantly losing money so he always needs new infusions.
</p>

<p>
	He lost $400 million of daddy's money.
</p>

<p>
	All his money is made from his brand name. So running for President was just a PR stunt to up his brand name.

<p>
	Unfortunately conservatives hate this idea. They want to punish such people because they are "evil-doers." It falls under their "law and order" dogma.

<p>
	It's confusing because it depends on how you define "you".
</p>

<p>
	What I meant in that video is that "Leo" is not in control. The control shifted from Leo to God in that moment.
</p>

<p>
	God has Infinite Free Will. Anything it wills instantly becomes material reality.

<title>what if an enlightened person gets mental illness?</title>

<p>
	It's unlikely that they would get schizophrenia, multiple-personality disorder, or OCD because those all tend to be dysfunctions of the ego mind. To become enlightened in the first place the person would have to heal and transcend those dysfunctions.
</p>

<p>
	Alzheimer's is possible. It's basically just going to lower cognitive ability & memory.
</p>

<p>
	As you age you will lose some cognitive ability and memory no matter what. It's just a matter of degree. The peak for cognitive ability is about age 30. It's down hill from there.
</p>

<p>
	Control is a dualistic notion because it implies a controller and a controlled. In truth, the two are one.
</p>

<p>
	In a nondual state controller and controlled collapse into oneness.

<p>
	Put starkly, a "bad" thing is a thing which kills you. But once you're dead, how can anything be bad? If you cannot be harmed, bad cannot exist for you.
</p>

<p>
	Now the trick is becoming conscious that nothing can harm you. If you manage to crack that nut, you'll only see Goodness.
</p>

<p>
	God is that which cannot be harmed.
</p>

<p>
	How can a gun shoot itself? A gun can only shoot that which is not itself. If it turns out that there is nothing other to it, it cannot be harmed.

</p>

<p>
	Let's say I'm a kid in high school and I want to try some heroin to see if I like it. Under your ideal system, would I be able to go buy some legally from the government or from a pharmacy?
</p>

<p>
	If not, then there will be a black market and cartels.
</p>

<p>
	The problem I see with clinics currently is that they only cater to already addicted people, not to new customers.

			Osho would absolutely agree with me. He would say something along the lines of, you cannot fight something created by the mind (toxic masculinity) with something created by the mind (toxic feminism). Can only shine light on the darkness. Your not going to fix machismo by shunning machismo. Only by giving these men the love that they need and are lacking so much in this day and age, will toxic masculinity be healed.

<p>
	The difference is, toxic feminism is something your mind created.
</p>

<p>
	Feminism just seeks equal rights. Yet you perceive that as toxic because it threatens your identity.

<p>
	Toad venom is at least 3x to 5x less potent per mg. So be sure to factor that into your calculus.
</p>

<p>
	1 gram of synthetic is worth about 3-5 grams of toad venom.

<p>
	A special attachment is formed which feels irreplaceable, yet it is replaceable and there's nothing objectively more special about one person than another.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same as love for one's children. Your children seem special, but honestly, they are no more special than any hungry kid off the street. If you were truthful you'd admit it.
</p>

<p>
	The ego creates this massive bias for the purposes of its survival. It's the epitome of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	You need to lie to yourself that your children are special, otherwise there'd be no compelling reason to protect them from annihilation.
</p>

<p>
	All sex is incest. Since everyone is a relative of everyone else. It's just a question of degree.

<p>
	That's why you are told to be detached from the fruits of your work.
</p>

<p>
	If you expect material compensation for everything you do, you'll be in a world of hurt.
</p>

<p>
	So what? This doesn't contradict the law.
</p>

<p>
	When understanding such spiritual laws, you have to understand them holistically, not in this nitpicky way of yours. The law does not say that you can't have some accident befall you. Something else is being said.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than trying to debunk the law, try to understand what it is trying to communicate to you.
</p>
