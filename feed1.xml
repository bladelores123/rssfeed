	1) How it shows up in your consciousness, it's being

<p>
	2) The story it tells

<p>
	If you had a thought in a foreign language which you did not understand the sounds would register in your consciousness (that's the actuality or being of a thought) but it would have no meaning/content/story.

<p>

<p>
	Almost no one is saying that. That is your sloppy misunderstanding and strawmanning of feminism.

	It's your circle jerk because you have not bothered to study any serious feminist literature. You are stuck in an echo-chamber of Red Pill like ideology. The more you listen to that garbage the more you will feel right.

<p>
	There is a complex interplay between the two.
</p>

<p>
	Plenty of people at the top do deserve to be there because they are exceptionally skilled, talented, experienced, and hard working. But there are many exceptions such as Trump.
</p>

<p>
	In a modern corporation you will not rise to the top unless you are exceptionally good at your job. But even so, that doesn't justify the exploitation of those below you.

The reason for his murder was because he was sunni. The killers were shia militia which was also supported by Gasem Soleimani.

<p>
	Of course Iran is less developed on the Spiral than the US and Iran has a collective ego and does behave in devilish ways.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, while Trump threatens Iranian cultural sites Iran is conscious enough to explicitly say they will not target US civilians.
</p>

<p>
	So far Iran has the moral high ground.

	Jerking off into napkin is killing a billion lives.

<p>
	Having a period is killing a life.
</p>

<p>
	Surviving an infection is killing millions of microscopic lives.
</p>

<p>
	See the arbitrariness and self-bias of how your ego-mind draws its boundaries.
</p>

<p>
	Pro-lifers are stuck because they refuse to admit the relativity of morality. And nothing you say will change their mind because they are not interested in seeking truth, they are interested in defending their beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	What people don't want to admit is that all evil is imaginary and invented by the ego for the purpose of its survival. Evil is falsehood.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, men are not being oppressed. The ego just perceives equalizing as oppression because a self-biased mind doesn't see a difference.
</p>

<p>
	If you owned slaves 200 years ago your ego-mind would perceive abolition as unfair and oppressive. Because it is from the POV of a slave owner. The slave owner feels fully entitled to own slaves. To take way his slaves would appear to him as robbery or debasement of the natural order.
</p>

<p>
	Equality is a radical thing. It means the ego has to surrender what it has taken for granted as its own.
</p>

<p>
	It is a projection of a low consciousness mind that if it gives up domination it will be dominated by those who complained about being dominated by it. The key is to realize that those you dominated may not be interested in dominating you back, they just want a non-dominating dynamic on all sides.

<p>
	Women had less rights because for the majority of mankind's evolution the state of consciousness was so low that physical force determined rights and power hierarchies. Survival was unbelievably brutal and physical. The strongest dominated the weakest and established "rights" and rules which served them.
</p>

<p>
	But now we are starting to move away from brutal animalistic survival and now the physical strength difference between men and women is becoming less and less important.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a matter of men deciding to give women rights, but rather the entire species is evolving in consciousness and society is developing hard and soft infrastructure which allows for non-violent means of existence. This is not a process anyone controls. Men do not control it. Both men and women are puppets of larger evolutionary forces which drive the entire universe towards greater consciousness and love. Those who are physically weaker are treated with more compassion. This is true not just of women but children, the sick, the disabled, the mentally ill, animals, the environment, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are conscious enough it is no longer tenable to dominate others even if you happen to be physically bigger or stronger than them. It hurts your own consciousness to do so. Ego is slowly realizing the existential equality of all beings by looking past the material differences -- which are not fundamentally important.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than seeing all this as a fight for rights, see it as an expansion of consciousness, love, and self-identity.
</p>

<p>
	If you were highly conscious and had high Self-Love, you would not have a desire to dominate anyone, even if it gave you some temporary material gain. The material gain is inferior to Selflessness.

	It doesn't matter what feeling you have or choice you make. That is the point. The ego sets conditions on love to suit its survival because it's biased. But love is not limited to that. Love is unlimited, infinite, and unconditional. Whether you understand that is another matter.

These are separate issues. An enlightened boomer can have shitty outdated politics. In fact, I would bet on it.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightened people can still be closedminded to things. They can still cling to false beliefs about the relative world. And they certainly still have biases of which they are not aware.

<p>
	Not at all.
</p>

<p>
	Philosophy classes in universities are as conformist and unoriginal as Sunday School.
</p>

<p>
	All of Harvard is a conformist nest. Little orginal thinking happens there.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse such things for truth-seeking or thinking. They are playing academic survival games. Nobody at Harvard understands what reality is or how consciousness works.
</p>

<p>
	No actual philosophy is done in a philosophy classroom. That would be far too dangerous to be allowed.

	Tucker Carlson don't give a fuck about foreign people. They are like animals from his level of consciousness. He cares about building up an American identity. All of his politics revolves around that, as does everyone's at Fox News. That is the function of Fox News: to build and defend an American collective ego.

	1) How many times did this happen exactly? Two times? That doesn't necessarily mean anything. Could just be a fluke. Although it is a bit odd.
</p>

<p>
	2) Learn to provide amazing sex and girls will be begging you to go exclusive with them. Seems like your sex is missing the dominance and newness components. For sex to be good, you have to find ways to keep it new. Don't be doing the exact same routine every time. Fuck her in the restaurant bathroom once in a while. Etc. Get creative. Dominance is also important. Drive up the masculine/feminine polarity. Make her feel feminine so she is satisfied.
</p>

<p>
	You can also up your value as a man. As you become more successful, more confident, more humorous, more wise, more healthy, etc. all this will massively attract her to you. She should see you as a one-of-a-kind catch. She should feel like she won the lottery in dating you.

<p>
	India simply lacks basic high-quality governmental infrastructure to sustain peace between all those tribes: court systems, roads, uncorrupted police, bridges, toilets, parks, meat inspections, etc. All of that must be built up before Stage Green can emerge in a significant way.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be Stage Green if 200 million people are still wiping their ass with their bare hands like they did 5,000 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	The function of government is to solve such logistical challenges. By solving such challenges egos are pacified and there can be talk of higher consciousness values. Otherwise people behave like animals.

<p>
	That is the point of automation. That is why automation is a very good and important trend. Automation frees up mankind to pursue their passions without needing to do grunt work. Most people simply don't understand this yet because living a passionate life is scary -- it takes a lot more responsibility and consciousness.

	If you were born into Hitler's shoes, you'd be precisely Hitler. This is so obvious it should go without saying, yet people are in such denial about it that they manage to overlook this obvious fact.

<p>
	No, it's not conscious. It's a lack of consciousness. It's self-bias, closemindedness, ego, and just how Stage Blue cognition works.
</p>

<p>
	He is genuine in his beliefs. Basically all people are genuine in their ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	From Ben Shaprio's POV, he's helping the world be a better place, he's acting from love -- like all people. But since his self-awareness is quite low, his love ends up being very selfish and partial. It's not really his fault. All evil is simply lack of consciousness. Which is why evil doesn't really exist. It is just misdirected love.

<p>
	Here you must distinguish between the intelligence required to think within the box of society vs the intelligence of truly original thinking.
</p>

<p>
	To earn a law degree you don't need to do any original thinking, you just need to be very good at following the rules and orders that society has laid out for you. You need to be a good soldier. Which is what Stage Blue excels at. Stage Blue is great at being meticulously conformist. If you need to hire someone to make sure that concentration camps operate like well-oiled machines, you hire a nice conformist boy like Ben Shaprio to manage it for you. He will do it without asking any questions. This was in fact how Nazi Germany was run.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Nothing strange about it. Every political position can be criticized from above or below, not just left vs right. You can be anti-interventionist from above or below. For example, you could believe that it's wrong to start a war in the Middle East because they are low-life savages who don't even deserve to fight the noble white man. But such anti-interventionism is further from Stage Green anti-interventionism than wanting to invade the Middle East to steal their oil. One would first have to evolve in consciousness just to see the Middle East as a worthwhile place to steal oil from, and only then one might evolve further in consciousness to actually care about the lives and interests of Middle Easterners as much as white lives and interests.
</p>

<p>
	You can be opposed to war for the wrong reasons. What matters most is not the fact that you oppose war, but what level of consciousness you're seeing the situation from. You might oppose war because you're to fearful of getting drafted. But that is a selfish perspective which is very different from opposing war because you're conscious of the suffering it would cause the "enemy".
</p>

<p>
	The true problem with the Middle East wars is not that it hurts America's interests, but that it creates suffering for innocent and powerless people in the Middle East. It's like kicking a wounded dog and blaming the dog.
</p>

	If every human took a shit in the same room, we'd all be dead.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing material scales infinitely. Everything has to be in proportion in a complex society.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake in your logic is that you assume that following your passion means that this should scale across 7 billion people. But of course it won't, simply because 95% won't ever even hear the advice, let alone follow it, so it's not something to worry about.
</p>

<p>
	Following your passion is advice aimed at 5% of the population. And that is workable. And by the time 5% of the population is following their passion, that will open the doors for another 5% to do the same, and so on, until one day we can have 50%+ people doing it, and maybe some day 90%+. But this will take many generations.
</p>

<p>
	You can be a musician precisely because most people have no interest in being musicians because they are not wired like you. Probably less than 1% of people in the world would choose to be a musician if they have total freedom to do whatever they wanted.
</p>

<p>
	For example, human civilization would collapse if everyone became enlightened overnight. Which is precisely why it will never happen. Enlightenment is very rare precisely because it needs to be rare in order for civilization to sustain itself. But this is irrelevant if you are the one who knows awakening is your thing.

<p>
	This applies all the way up and down the chain of life.
</p>

<p>
	If a Unified World Government seems unlikely or impractical, just remember that 2000 years ago the idea of a country was crazy because there were only walled city-states. And 2 billion years ago, the idea of multicellular organisms was crazy because there were only single-celled organisms eating each other.
</p>

<p>
	For a human body to exist, single-celled organisms had to learn to cooperate with each other despite having their own selfish agendas.

	He was a regional war hero, akin to George Washington.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine how Americans would react if George Washington was assassinated by Iran. That is the situation here. Even the most moderate Iranians will now be pissed off and driven to violence because this is a matter of pride and self-respect. No self-respecting nation can allow such abuse.
</p>

<p>
	When Iranian history books are written, Soleimani will go down as their George Washington, and now a martyr at the hands of an evil empire. A generation of children will grow up hating America.
</p>

<p>
	Killing him was the worst possible strategic blunder from America's POV. Iran is now united and empassioned.

	Every US general and secretary of defense is a war criminal by the US's own logic.
</p>

<p>
	Of course top military leaders mastermine the deaths of thousands of people. That is their job.
</p>

<p>
	By the US's own logic, all top US officials are justified to be assassinated for their military planning. That's how absurdly self-biased the position is.

	Stop listening to him period. His intellect is just garbage.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who takes the likes of him or Tucker Carlson seriously is just a joke. You cannot take anything they say seriously because it is so stunningly self-biased and intectually bankrupt.
</p>

<p>
	Some people are so banrkupt that even to listen to them or engage with them seriously is already a mistake. This pretty much goes for anyone at Fox News. It's self-biased propaganda.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be listening to and debating with someone who is pro-slavery.

	This was the greatest concern about Trump now come to fruition.
</p>

<p>
	The correct wording here is: the US assassinated Iranian top leader. But notice how US media doesn't phrase it that way due to self-bias.

<p>
	It's a small factor but nothing worth worrying about.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, reverse racism is just racism. Racism doesn't only apply to white people. Anyone can be racist.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to use the notion of reverse racism to argue that nothing needs to be done about racism or that racism doesn't exist. Which is just hogwash.

<p>
	That's your strawman of what they say. They never actually say 90%. More like 25%. Which is about right.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, they demonize the right too much sometimes. How else could Green be?
</p>

<p>
	Racism is a serious issue which the country has not yet fully addressed. There's a lot of denial going around about it still. People like to think they are more developed than they actually are.

<p>
	Your issue is more basic than meditation. Meditation is not going to fix your neediness because you're not at a level of development yet where you can even take meditation seriously.
</p>

<p>
	The advice for you is: work on your isolation, learn to socialize, build social skills, develop friends, develop dating skills, have sex, and THEN meditation will help you reach higher levels.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation is not a shortcut for avoiding learning basic survival skills like dating, making money, proper diet, etc. Meditation is a rather advanced skill for people who have already become proficient at survival and want to reach the next level.
</p>

<p>
	Once you've had a bunch of sex and made a bunch of money, then you ask, "Okay, what's next?" That's where meditation starts to look appealing.

<p>
	Don't assume that. Most people here don't meditate or meditate so ineffectively that they might as well be watching TV.
</p>

<p>
	Serious meditation is a rare skill that very few people practice.
</p>

<p>
	And meditation takes years to pay off.

<p>
	If you put a stage Orange person in a Green environment, they are likely to not fit in and have falling out. Which is what happened.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not so simplistic as to say that if you put an Orange person into a higher environment he will automatically grow into it. Many people will have a backlash and entrench themselves in their old stage.
</p>

<p>
	If TYT hired a white supremacist, he would probably quit in short order and start his own white supremacy YT channel.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I think it describes his behavior very well.
</p>

<p>
	Since a solid Orange person is very much driven by personal success and profit, it makes a lot of sense that Rubin would dump TYT and its values to start his own show and make a big name for himself speaking out against liberals as a gay dude.
</p>

<p>
	It seems that Rubin's work at TYT was not based on deeply held Green values but a desire to make it in online media. Which is a very Orange thing. And that's exactly why he didn't fit in there and why he's doing his current show.
</p>

<p>
	He wasn't developed enough to last at TYT.
</p>

<p>
	This is easily evidenced by his last of understanding of Green values and his libertarianism.
</p>

<p>
	Yellow? Ha!
</p>

<p>
	He's stuck in Orange with a big Green shadow.
</p>

<p>
	He didn't see the limits of Green. Just as he started getting exposed to Green he couldn't handle it and doubled-down on Orange.
</p>

<p>
	He is criticizing Green from below, not above.

<p>
	Every story you construct will come crashing down on your head one day, because you are building castles in the sky.

	And to defend those stories you will of course become a devil. Because the truth is, they are all fictions you've invented to suit your ego's survival.

	JP carefully avoids serious discussions of policy. He's focused on culture wars to distract from real issues like corporate corruption, environmental destruction, military-industrial complex, gross income inequality, gerrymandering, voter suppression, suppression of unions, anti-trust violations, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Because in his world these are not important issues. His world revolves around silly happenings on college campuses. You can't make a good career out of talking about serous policy issues. It's much easier to make a career out of being a cultural warrior who wages a lesser Jihad.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental conservative position is that things are basically fine if we just return to the way things were and stop rocking the boat with progressive ideas. The need for structural reform isn't evident to them because they are busy defending the system to which they have hitched their identity.
</p>

<p>
	A Christian doesn't see a need to reform Christianity, he sees the evils of Islam instead.
</p>

<p>
	A scientists doesn't see a need to reform science, he sees the evils of religion instead.
</p>

<p>
	A democrat doesn't see a need to reform the democrat party, he sees the evils of republicans instead.
</p>

<p>
	This is classic self-deception: create a distraction by projecting the problem outward at some scapegoat. Meanwhile, no deep self-reflection is done and no real internal structure change is made -- which his exactly what the ego wants.
</p>

<p>
	JP doesn't want to seriously investigate the structural limitations of capitalism. So he scapegoats liberals as Neo-Marxists which creates a loud flashy sideshow that draws in a crowd of mouth-breathers who also have no interest in a deep analysis of capitalism. As that would actually require some mental and emotional labor. It would be scary and unsettling to admit that maybe you are part of a corrupt and mindless capitalist regime that perpetuates the needless suffering of millions. Especially if that regime earns you good money and feeds your children.

	Well, that's not gonna happen. Even the idea of a safe space is already ridiculed and demonized by the right-wing. And they are certainly incapable of non-judgment and non-criticism. As are most left-wingers.

<p>
	Of course, otherwise it would have been resolved a thousand years ago. These are profound existential challenges of a cosmic order requiring millions of deaths to understand and transcend. This is life and death stuff we're dealing with. It doesn't get any more serious than this.
</p>

<p>
	And yet ironically it's all a joke in the end.
</p>

<p>
	We (God) are stuck in an existential bind of infinite proportion.

	Suffering sits deeper than belief.
</p>

<p>
	When the suffering gets strong enough, all your pretty beliefs will fly out the window. Then only consciousness can prevail. And even that will flag and wane for most people. Only training of consciousness can overcome that.

			Who cares if the suffering is imaginary when it feels real and causes me all this pain?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The point is precisely that if you were conscious that suffering is imaginary, it would stop being painful.
</p>

<p>
	But you're not conscious of that, so it is still painful for you.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between believing that suffering is imaginary vs actually being conscious of it at the moment of the torture. This work is not done at the level of belief.
</p>

<p>
	So you're right in that there is no point in believing that reality is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	But you're wrong in that that's not what I'm suggesting you to do. I'm suggesting you to become CONSCIOUS of it. Which is a totally different thing. You are not anywhere near being conscious of it yet. This seems like a word game because for you it IS only a word game. But I am telling you there is something beyond the word game which you are not yet aware of. If you ever go beyond the word game, that's where you'll feel the difference.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine becoming so conscious that you can no longer be physically killed. That's what we're talking about here. Obviously this cannot happen as a matter of belief. You must actually become physically unkillable. How is such a thing possible? Well, if you knew how, you'd already be immortal. So of course it won't make much sense from your current vantage point. You have to be willing to go radically outside the box of what you consider reality to be.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that your ego will try to keep all of these teachings safely at the level of word games. Because then the ego is never threatened. The challenge in this work is to make sure you're actually doing the work, not just thinking about it. Thinking about doing the work is not the same as doing the work. Talking about enlightenment is not enlightenment. Thinking about reality being an illusion is not the same as experiencing it as such in every moment.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between talking about having a million dollars vs actually having one million in cash in your closet.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	You are confusing two things: truth and what your ego wants. Spirituality in its purest form means more truth, whatever that entails. It might entail an early death (as in the case of Jesus) or a long life (as in the case of The Buddha). But truth is truth regardless of its consequences on the ego.
</p>

<p>
	The point is not that spirituality ultimately leads to less stability, the opposite is the case if you do it right. The problem is that there are many traps, many ways to screw it up along the way. And even if you tell people about all the traps, they will still not listen and fall into them.
</p>

<p>
	But also don't forget the many dangers of not doing this work. It's not as though your life will go smoothly if you avoid this work. The opposite is the case.

	Buckle in, because your work has only just begun. You are like at page 2 of a 10,000 page book thinking you're close to the end.
</p>

<p>
	The work is far deeper than it is ever possible to communicate.

<p>
	Seems like you're taking too much too fast and have more basic personal development work to do.
</p>

<p>
	All of this is fine, just pace yourself better.

<title>Leo's Work Is Becoming Dangerous</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/43949-leos-work-is-becoming-dangerous/?do=findComment&amp;comment=552079</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The topics we deal with here are inherently dangerous and could not be otherwise since they involve undoing and transcending survival.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is very dangerous to the ego-mind. These dangers are not merely perceptual, they are also "actual", in the sense of physical danger. You can't do serious spiritual work and also complain, "But this can be dangerous". Of course! If it wasn't dangerous it wouldn't be worth doing. The whole point is that its dangerous and therefore rarely done well.
</p>

<p>
	This works requires enormous nuance, care, and intelligence. These are structural meta-qualities which cannot ever be codified in the form of content. Which means, no matter how many times a teacher says to be nuanced, careful, and intelligent, it will not help someone who is sloppy, careless, and ignorant. You cannot make a person intelligent by telling them to be intelligent. If things were so easy we wouldn't be here struggling with consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The danger of the work is exactly what makes it so appealing. There are stakes. Much like life. Otherwise it would just be armchair philosophy with no transformative power. Changing your life comes at a cost. You might change it for the worse.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, set priorities and pace things out in stages. If you pace things well, then yes.
</p>

<p>
	You need to think 10 years ahead.
</p>

<p>
	But if you just randomly try to do multiple things at once you'll probably not get anywhere on either front.
</p>

<p>
	Mastering a career or art takes so much work, dedication, and attention that you need to have a clear, singular vision for what you're trying to achieve. Then hit it every day for 5-10 years relentlessly.
</p>

<p>
	This is discussed in detail in my Life Purpose Course.

<p>
	That's your mistake right there. Instead, open yourself to embracing it and loving it as one facet of what you are.
</p>

<p>
	The point of all this work is to transcend fear, replacing it with love.

<p>
	That and a hundred other things. Your entire sense of self, your entire psyche is involved. Everything your psyche fears, hates, denies, desires, and worries about it is involved.

	The details aren't really important. It's just the sum total of all your attachments and impurities as an ego-mind.

<p>
	No, because they are not phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness itself transcends all contents of consciousness in the way that a TV screen is permanent even though the content it displays is impermanent.

<p>
	The mistake you're making here is thinking of enlightenment/consciousness as phenomena. They are not. That's the whole point. If they were phenomena they would not be worth pursuing.

<p>
	1) The mind is always changing.
</p>

<p>
	2) The mind will be gone forever with death. It only seems permanent because you're judging it exclusively from inside itself, inside the context of your life. Your mind is treating your life as an absolute standard next to which everything else is judged and understood. But this is precisely backwards. You life could end in a split second at any moment and nothing of it will remain.

	Well, that Void is a classic advanced meditation state. Totally healthy and fine.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it will be shocking for anyone the first time they encounter it. The ego-mind will perceive it as death.

<p>
	It's not that big of deal for me. Just don't do it more than once a day, and take some days off in between. A couple times a week seems to work best.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, having sex actually takes a lot more time and energy.
</p>

<p>
	As with most things, a lot depends on how you do it and how you frame it in your mind. For me there is no negative vibe associated with it. You can do it in healthy ways to rejuvenate yourself.

<description><![CDATA[

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13355-dean-walker/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13355" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13355-dean-walker/" rel="">@Dean Walker</a> Figuring all that out is the bulk of your path. We can't tell you want you want and in which order you want it. You have to introspect to get clear about what your priorities should be for the next 5 years, let's say. Usually you want to focus on one key area of life like: business/career/life purpose, relationships/family, health/fitness, spirituality/meditation, education, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can't do it all at once. You gotta prioritize what you're most engaged in working on, what you most need to advance to the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	As an example, my first business stage lasted about 3 years, basically full-time. Then my relationship/dating stage lasted 1-2 years almost full-time. Then my next life purpose/business stage lasted 6 years, almost full-time. My fitness stage lasted a few years, part-time, sprinkled within the stages above.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, life is long and if you're young you've got plenty of time to pace yourself and plan stuff out in stages. 3 years invested into X, 5 years invested into Y, 2 years invested in Z.
</p>

<p>
	If you are starting a new biz, I would recommend planning to invest 5 years into it. At least 3 years. Anything less than that I just don't see how you'll succeed. 3 years is barely enough time for something like that.
</p>

<p>
	Not all things require equal time. Something like biz will be one of the most time-intensive things in your life if you want to succeed at it. Competition is fierce and there is a never-ending amount of work. Since biz is such a massive time investment it's wise to be very clear what values your want your business to represent.
</p>

<p>
	No, depends on how powerful your will is.
</p>

<p>
	If you're talking about altering physical reality in a way which affects others, your will needs to be equally powerful. These are not levels of access that the universe grants to most people, for obvious reasons, since there is enormous potential for devilry. Only the most spiritual advanced people might be given such access. Which is why you don't see people walking through brick walls every day. The whole point of "physical reality" is so that ordinary beings could not change it willy-nilly. You won't want people being able to walk through the walls of your house while you're jerking off in there.

<p>
	I am not well enough informed on this issue to give an opinion.
</p>

<p>
	Indian politics is not my jam. If you study the principles of Conscious Politics as I laid them out in my 4 part series and also Spiral Dynamics, that should allow you to make sense of most political issues by yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you also need accurate facts about the on-the-ground situation. Which I don't have in this case.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking I know that Modi is Blue and pushing a Blue cultural agenda. But India is so under-developed that I would be less critical of such things than I would in America. America should know better. India, not yet.

<p>
	Realistically, oppression of minorities and even genocide in India is par for the course. They are not collectively developed yet to transcend that. They must learn the hard way, by causing great harm to themselves and facing the ugliness of their selfish actions.

	UBI is a good idea, but it is only the beginning of other much needed reform. UBI by itself will not fix the fundamental corruption at the heart of the system. The systemic corruption is worse than anyone understands or knows how to fix. The corruption is at an existential level.

<title>Trip report: Is the object I hallucinate real in physical sense?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/43928-trip-report-is-the-object-i-hallucinate-real-in-physical-sense/?do=findComment&amp;comment=551475</link>

<p>
	Hehehe.... All "physical reality" is a hallucination held stable in the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	But that's still not the end of the mindfuck. The mind of God is nothing at all. So the fan doesn't really exist even when you stick your hand in it.
</p>

<p>
	It's all absolutely nothing. Nothing has ever happened. You imagine it did.
</p>

<p>
	All being is a direct manifestation of Will. As you become more conscious your will is able to materialize physical objects. But this is not the ego's will, it is the Will of Infinite Mind. As thr ego-mind unravels you become Infinite Mind, completely unlimited.
</p>

<p>
	If you became totally selfless you would have enough Will to materialize the entire physical universe in the blink of an eye. Well, you already are doing it, which is how it is here, but you're not conscious of how you're doing or even that you are doing it.
</p>

<p>
	When you trip you get a tiny, tiny taste of how Will generates physical reality, which is why the visual field starts to warp and the things you think start to spawn "hallucinations". If you think of a devil hard enough, one will materialize.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, AA is a bit dogmatic and stage Blue-ish. It's not designed for advanced people, and that's fine for what it is. But there is so much more.
</p>

<p>
	It's just a question of where you're at and how high you want to go.
</p>

<p>
	You must be willing to outgrow your peers, your support structures, and even your teachers. This is what makes advanced growth so challenging: you have to transcend all invented social support structures (since they don't go high enough).
</p>

<p>
	Once you climb to the end of the ladder mankind has built for you, you must chop down some trees and build new rungs yourself. Those who always expect the ladder to be built for them by others won't go very high.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bit odd that Yang argues that we are not yet ready for Medicare For Fall while pushing UBI. Right now we have a wider concensus for Medicare For All than UBI. At least 50% of the public is asking for Medicare For All. Not many are asking for UBI.

So he's grasping for an explanation of the Absolute but his cognition is too rigid and non-relativistic to do it. So he dances around a lot without ever hitting the nail on the head. Because he himself is confused about it. But he knows he's stumbled onto something important, which is why he's quite adamant about it. But he's adamant in the wrong direction.
</p>

<p>
	He's sorely missing a theoretical framework of nonduality and Anekantavada, trapped in his moralistic Christian upbringing.

	He thinks soviet Communists and college kids who support Bernie Sanders and trans rights are the same.

<p>
	Someone who has integrated Green would clearly see the difference between those two. This is a classic right-wing trap.

<p>
	You're not quite seeing how radical Self-Love is.
</p>

<p>
	ANYTHING you do, is Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	If you murder your family, that is Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is unlimited and you cannot ever fail it. Develop the courage to stop judging yourself, others, and reality. That's true Self-Love. Anything less would be ego. Which is also Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	How would you act if you knew you were loved under all choices and circumstances? THAT is liberation. Anything less is slavery.
</p>

			Leo, aside from the enlightment part, do you think that Lacan's and psychoanalisis model of reality is worth it to understand social dynamics and yourself?

<p>
	Personally I don't like psychoanalysis. I think it's more deluded than true. There are certainly some bits of truth in it, but also plenty of nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	There are much better resources. You don't want to end up like Slavoj Zizek: academically brilliant, but spiritually dumb as a rock.

Rather than trying to avoid bad trips, your intention should be to go into each trip and accomplish some shadow work. Confront those parts of yourself which you don't want to confront. Sort out your psyche. Slowly work through all your lies, fears, traumas, low self-esteem, grudges, etc. until your mind is pure. Then you will be ready for metaphysical contemplation.

<p>
	Remember, this is a long-term game we're playing.
</p>

<p>
	Slow and steady wins the race. Don't treat self-actualization as a 1 year activity. Treat it like a life-long activity which you have no choice but to do. This should put things into proper perspective.
</p>

<p>
	It's like going to church. People who go to church never think to themselves, "How soon until all this church attendance is done? 3 years? What if I attend three times as much per week? Can I finish it in 1 year?"
</p>

<p>
	No! You go to church for life.
</p>

<title>My fear of approaching girls is very real</title>

</p>

<p>
	That's how this problem is solved. Not by sitting around on your ass.
</p>

<p>
	Approaching is very scary if you try to start doing it solo. You basically won't have the balls to do it unless you see a wingman doing it first.
</p>

<p>
	Solo approaching is one of the hardest things to do at first. Your mind will do everything possible to make sure you don't do the approach. It's psychological warfare with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But also solo approaching is where boys become men.
