You speak of things of which you have not yet become conscious.
</p>

<p>
	Don't bring JP into discussions of nonduality please. He's no clue what nonduality really entails, nor does anyone who takes him seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than pushing your ideology, why not sit down and become conscious of what meaning really is?
</p>

<p>
	Look closely. You have no idea what it is yet.

<p>
	A ruler is also an invention.
</p>

<p>
	Einstein taught you this 100 years ago. The length of a ruler changes depending on its velocity relative to the observer.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "a ruler" in any objective sense.

</p>

<p>
	The whole process is relative. It's all about where you are now and where you need to go next. You have insights and then you outgrow them, have some more, outgrow them, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	You're not gonna go from newbie to Zen master in one giant leap. It's gonna be a long, slow, grueling process of having dozens and hundreds of various insights.
</p>

<p>
	You're going mature every day a little bit. Some days a lot. Some days, you will regress.

<p>
	You are never going to succeed in this path without high quality theory. It's just full of too many traps, one of which is too much theory, another one of which is too little theory.

	Conscious is unlimited, so it creates every possible thing, the same way that a gas will expand to occupy every corner of its container. But consciousness has no container, so it just keeps creating forever.

Pure intelligence. As Anaxagoras described it. This is NOT the same thing as merely feeling the miraculousness of the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	Apparently you ain't done that yet.
</p>

<p>
	Like I keep saying, there are many facets and degrees of penetration to this work. But nobody seems to take me seriously when I say that. You guys keep thinking I'm deluded or something. But I warned you guys a long time ago that there is more complexity to this work than most people realize.
</p>

<p>
	If you are content with being in the present moment, that's all well and good. But you don't know what intelligence is. That would be a cool thing to discover someday, if you're the metaphysically curious sort. Don't you wanna know how you engineered yourself?

<p>
	These kinds of threads become very toxic very fast on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry
</p>

<p>
	All politics is self-agenda in action. Regardless of whatever your positions are. So there cannot really be any truthful discussion of politics, because the goal of politics is to rig the game to meet your ego's needs.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you think your politics is going to save the whole world << that's your ego meeting its perceived needs. It's survival through and through. Which is why political discussion quickly devolves into shit-slinging contests.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be very careful when mixing politics and personal development.
</p>

<p>
	Depends on how you use it.
</p>

<p>
	All theory comes with the danger of misuse and mental masturbation.
</p>

<p>
	Most of my videos are meant to be INSPIRATIONAL. Not technical how-to's. You get inspired by the theory, which then makes you want to work hard to actualize it.

<p>
	If you were not limited to sitting down, you'd be standing up. You're overlooking the obvious: you <strong><u>ARE</u></strong> limited in that case. Your body is very much limited. Which is why it occupies a very specific position and location within the universe. Of all the possible ways you could be located in the universe, you are located EXACTLY one way -- the way you find yourself being right now!
</p>

<p>
	Ponder the following: Why would reality be one way vs another way? What would enforce or obligate reality to be any particular way rather than its opposite? And what would enforce that enforcement? And what would enforce that enforcement of enforcement? And so on....
</p>

<p>
	You see?

<p>
	Your idea of Infinity is not Infinity, it is finity. See?

<p>
	The map is not the territory.
</p>

<p>
	Anything you think about Infinity is automatically wrong. Any logic you apply to Infinity will crumble and not make sense.

<p>
	Infinity cannot be held in the mind. But it is definitely Infinitely Intelligent.

But it's not the kind of "questioning" you're talking about. The "questioning" you're doing right now is a sort of fear-based skepticism. That's not true questioning. True questioning is totally open and curious. Fear of being wrong shouldn't be on your mind. It's the ego-mind which fears being wrong.
</p>

<p>
	The psychedelic will reveal truth to you in an organic, effortless manner. You can doubt it afterwards if you like. If you try to apply fear-based skepticism in the middle of the trip, you are not surrendering, and you will likely have a bad trip. Psychedelics punish arrogance. And fear-based skepticism -- despite how it might seem to you -- is arrogance.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like your aversion to psychedelics is fear-based.
</p>

<p>
	For me, stopping is not a problem or an issue. I have no attachment to psychedelics. I use them like a tool, in moderation.
</p>

It needs to be directly experienced.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation, yoga, self-inquiry, psychedelics. That's what you need.
</p>

<p>
	The present moment you are experiencing right now is a tiny fragment of an Absolute Infinite singularity, which includes all things that could ever be, and at the same time, none of it ever happened or even exists.
</p>

<p>
	What you are experiencing right now, is Absolutely Nothing. But it sure doesn't feel that way, does it? Because you have created a duality between something and nothing, when in fact the two are ONE.
</p>

<p>
	You are everything that could ever possibly be, and you are nothing. This is beyond the mind's ability to understand. It requires a radical shift in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the whole trick to mathematics is how to define the units, and every definition is permissible.
</p>

<p>
	You can say a carton of eggs is 1, or a dozen, a trillion trillion atoms.
</p>

<p>
	Mathematics is a projection of the mind. It's about where your mind chooses to draw the boundaries.
</p>

<p>
	Also, interestingly: 1 infinity - 1 infinity = 1 infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity contains an infinite number of infinities inside it! <img alt=":o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy@2x.png 2x" title=":o" width="20" />

But 3-4 rounds is really nothing. I recommend you do 12-24 rounds at least. The point of yoga is to move that prana up your spine. Open those chakras. Then you can meditate.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise, you're not really doing yoga, you're meditating. In which case just meditate and forget about yoga.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga is not for everyone. For some people, meditation will be a better path. Find what works for you.

		<p>
			Also how can we know for sure that insights we have while tripping are true? They may feel true, but when it’s something as powerful as 5-meo; is it not possible that it might be able to create things that are true, or feel true?

<p>
	Try it and see. That's the only way you know anything at all.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot know ahead of time how the Absolute is Absolute. But it's Absolute, and you'll know it immediately once you're in it. How is that possible? This cannot be explained to you because you are asleep.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's possible to misinterpret psychedelic trips. Very possible. The tendency for self-deception is ALWAYS at work in everything you do. Self-deception is even possible after enlightenment. There is no escaping the possibility of self-deception, ever, so long as you have a mind.
</p>

<p>
	The question you should be more concerned about is: "What if my current thinking is self-deception? What if I'm having all these doubts about this path because I'm asleep? What if I'm questioning psychedelics because I'm really just too afraid and lazy to try them?"

</p>

<p>
	And solipsism doesn't acknowledge other facets of enlightenment like that you are God, Absolute Infinity, infinite intelligence, transcendence of death, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And solipsism doesn't acknowledge no-self. A solipsist is still full of ego.
</p>

<p>
	Solipsism is still stuck at the level of human perception. It just says, "This bubble of human perception is the only truth. Others don't exist."
</p>

<p>
	With nonduality, it's more like: "Others exist as illusions that I created as God. The illusory world is infinite."
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is going to feel very different than solipsism from a first-person POV. Although the ego-mind may think they are the same.

<p>
	REALLY BE CURIOUS about your new situation. It's actually quite cool if you think about it from outside your ego.

<p>
	It's not horrible, it's just a new perspective on reality.

<title>The 5-MeO-DMT Mega-Thread</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/6570-vingger/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="6570" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/6570-vingger/" rel="">@Vingger</a> It radically progressed my understanding of nonduality, in ways that would not be possible in 20+ years of meditation or yoga. This understanding is both intellectual and at the emotional/body level. Less-so at the body level.
</p>

<p>
	As far as rewiring my mind habits, not so much. I find psychedelics are not too effective at that. They are more effective at giving you radical glimpses which shock your mind into seeing the world from a radically new perspective. But your old mind-habits largely remain unchanged. Of course that may vary from person to person, and if you do a lot trips, there may be some significant rewiring.
</p>

<p>
	Experiencing Absolute Infinity is a life-changing event. It was the most important event in my life. Your life cannot be the same afterwards. Although most of your habits will remain unchanged and your level of consciousness will drop back down to baseline. You will be back asleep, but you will at least know what true awakening looks like.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to significantly rewire your brain with psychedelics, I think it's possible, but will require 50-100+ trips spread out over a long time.
</p>

<p>
	I'm up to about 12 5-MeO trips total. If I did 30 trips back to back, that would produce some serious change. The trouble is, it's so jarring it would probably put your entire life on hold as you have to deal with all the emotional baggage, fear, depression, and resistance that rises. It would be brutal on your ego, and you probably couldn't take it and have a big ego backlash. It all depends on how ready you are to awaken.
</p>

<title>Path to enlightenment don't have to be painful</title>

</p>

<p>
	It just requires exceptional talent and enormous amounts of grinding work. We're talking 10,000+ hours of it, done in large consecutive chunks.
</p>

<p>
	Read Om Swami's accounts of how hard he meditates, for example. It's an insane, super-human feat he does. It's just not realistic for most people. This is the kind of stuff only monks have time to do. This is like Olympic level meditation.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I talk about psychedelics is because they offer ordinary people a glimpse of what a 40 year enlightened master or full-time monk experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you could take a pill and experience what it is like to play golf at Tiger Wood's level, or to play the piano at Mozart's level, or play chess at Gary Kasparov's level. That would be awesome, and highly useful to normal people.
</p>

<p>
	Well, psychedelics are just that.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I've had insights on 5-MeO that Shinzen Young has yet to have, and he's like 80 years old and has been teaching this stuff for 50 years. I can see that Shinzen is not fully enlightened. This would be totally impossible for me to see without 5-MeO. I've talked to students of his who have been practicing with him for 10-15 years, and they are still not enlightened, or even close.
</p>

<p>
	(BTW, nothing against Shinzen. I think he's a great teacher.)
</p>

<p>
	It's almost impossible to convey how deep the rabbit hole goes.
</p>

<title>Fear of the truth of Solipsism</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/21984-fear-of-the-truth-of-solipsism/?do=findComment&amp;comment=238896</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Nonduality is NOT solipsism.
</p>

<p>
	But the ego-mind may not see it that way at first.
</p>

<p>
	It is true that you are the only thing in existence. You created every human being that exists. Of course the trick is, we're talking about the universal YOU, not the personal you.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple logic: if nonduality is true, there is no division between anything. There is certainly no division between you/other. You are your own mother. You created Actualized.org to help you awaken. You even wrote this sentence. You are God in every literal sense.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is of course afraid of this. And it may be a shock to the system when you first start to realize how radical nonduality really it. It may feel like madness. Of course it's not madness. It's TRUTH. But TRUTH is a radical thing. It requires a very deep surrender.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, once you fully surrender, it will be fine. Great even.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality, at the highest degrees of it, is extremely radical. It will shock and terrify the ego-mind. That is the #1 obstacle which keeps people unenlightened. You have to surrender to the radicalness of it. You have to surrender to the madness. It's not really madness. But it will appear to be madness relative to the normie paradigm you are used to.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightened people are basically insane by all conventional standards. They just happen to be insane in a functional way. And they don't frame it that way because it would scare off newbies.
</p>

<p>
	The lite degrees of nonduality can feel pleasant and nice.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest degrees of nonduality can feel downright terrifying and depressing.
</p>

<p>
	And the final stage is peace and wonder.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't that the whole point?
</p>

<p>
	Of course don't overdo it. Ramp it up gradually over weeks and months.
</p>

<p>
	But 6 pranayama is really nothing. People do up to 72 or even 100+ pranayamas a day.
</p>

<p>
	Most of you will need to do 10,000s of pranayamas to start seeing serious results. Some will need less, depending on your spiritual attunement.

	If you become really conscious, you will not need my teachings. But it will probably take you much longer to reach that stage than you think.

But it will end up longer than that pretty soon because you need to aim for 36x Pranayamas + 20 mins of breath of fire + 10 mins at least of concentration.
</p>

<p>
	It will start to grow upwards of 90 mins in the end. But do it gradually, over time. 90 mins is tough.

<p>
	And your depression is trying to ensure you keep that need met.

<p>
	It's important to optimize the routine because you only have so much time in the day. Keep it tight and super-potent is my philosophy. 70 mins is a long time.

<p>
	There's your story.

<p>
	The teaching of detachment is probably just too advanced for you right now. Go ahead and fix up your life and earn some success. Then you can revisit the importance of detachment (once you have a bunch of attachments and you can appreciate how much they make you suffer).
</p>

<p>
	You need to climb Maslow's Hierarchy a bit before you get into the nonduality stuff. Learn how to function in the world effectively first. Learn how to feed yourself. There will be a lot of personal development lessons there for you.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like you're asking, "What if the clouds in Super Mario World are related to the TV screen?"
</p>

<p>
	It's almost trivial.
</p>

<p>
	What the precise nature of that relationship is, that's highly non-trivial, requiring serious investigation.
</p>

<p>
	And in the end, everything in infinitely interconnected and inter-caused. Everything is the cause of everything else from the biggest picture perspective.

<title>There are no levels of Enlightenment, no levels of consciousness</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/21928-there-are-no-levels-of-enlightenment-no-levels-of-consciousness/?do=findComment&amp;comment=238490</link>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10174-saumaya/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="10174" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10174-saumaya/" rel="">@Saumaya</a> There is an important practical difference though:
</p>

<p>
	People can realize one part of enlightenment without realizing another part. This not a hypothetical point. It happens very commonly.
</p>

<p>
	For example, one can realize no-self but not realize Absolute Infinity. Or one can realize no-self but fail to have an insight about the nature of love or the nature of other beings.
</p>

<p>
	So, even if in your particular case you managed to somehow realize all the facets of enlightenment in one fell swoop. Which I highly, highly doubt. That would be a special case. The more general case for people pursuing enlightenment is that they will have to access each facet individually, and then all of them collectively, at various times. Otherwise, people will have one profound insight and think: "That's it! That's all there is. I'm done." When in fact they have only scratched the surface, nowhere even close to done.
</p>

<p>
	Take some strong psychedelics and see how many different levels and facets of consciousness there are.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in the end it's all ONE consciousness. But consciousness manifests itself in various ways, for example: dreaming vs waking consciousness. You can say that dreaming and awaking are ultimately the same, because everything is ultimately nondual, but this is not true from the unawakened person's POV -- and that's who your teachings should be aimed at.
</p>

<title>Could Nonduality Be An Illusion?</title>

So definitely, it can be an illusion from your POV.
</p>

<p>
	There is no one you can trust to tell you the Truth, because you are it.
</p>

<p>
	Truth-seekers don't have the luxury of a tit to suck on. Hence truth-seeking is not a popular hobby.
</p>

<p>
	As the Buddha once said, "The only way you can know if you have an ass, is by bending over and looking at it."

There is no mistaking it for something else.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need a PhD to experience God. But you do need an exceptional, almost super-human degree of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	What is God? is like the question, What am I? It does little good to here the answer. You gotta experience the answer directly for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The classic definition of God is very precise: an omniscient, omnipresent, all-powerful, all-loving, eternal, formless, infinite intelligence which created itself.

So lots of research, study, and practice with the topic you're talking about is key.
</p>

<p>
	2) You must also be genuinely passionate and interested in the topic.
</p>

<p>
	3) Practice, practice, practice. Don't think too much, just let your mouth move and say whatever it feels like saying. You can polish it up with more practice.

</p>

<p>
	Also, don't expect shamanic breathing to fix all your bad habits for you. It can help you release some of the low consciousness motives driven them, but you'll have to consciously and proactively put an end to them.
</p>

<p>
	Try starting a Kriya yoga practice. It should be better than meditation.

<p>
	You say that so flippantly because you haven't even come close to experiencing God. That's your ego talking. And ego hates God.
</p>

<p>
	The name/word is given so that we can communicate effectively with one another. Right now, you are missing the communication because you believe God cannot exist. And I'm tell you, you're wrong. You are further complicating your error by appeal to the argument, "But God is just a word." Which is like doubling-down on your mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Platypus is also just a word. But there is such a thing as a platypus that you can discover. It's a remarkable creature which would shock and delight you had you never seen a picture of it before. Starting a thread on a platypus forum that goes: "Platypus Do Not Exist: platypus is just a word" only makes you stuck.

	Open your mind to the possibility that God does exist. Then proceed with your practices. And then maybe one day, in 10 years, you will discover something amazing that you couldn't imagine in a million years.

<title>Am I alone? Enlightenment experience led to Solipsism, and it made me Depressed</title>

</p>

<p>
	Nonduality means there cannot be any "other" who is not you. The deepest levels of nonduality can make you start to feel lonely, as you realize that you created this entire dream all by yourself and the illusion of "otherness" gets shattered. It can feel very solipsistic, but also, as the mind adjusts to your new understanding, the loneliness should dissipate.
</p>

<p>
	I do not exist. You created this forum to entertain yourself. And here you are reading all these posts that you yourself wrote to yourself. Seeking advice from "others" who are really just yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Try to see the beauty of that.
</p>

<p>
	Aloneness and connection are ONE. You can look at it like the glass is half empty, or the glass is half full. By being everyone, you are infinitely connected to everyone.
</p>

<p>
	You still haven't surrendered fully to nonduality. Yes, it's very radical and scary to surrender fully to it. The truth is radical beyond words. Your fear of being totally alone is precisely what you must explore and ultimately surrender. The ego-mind hates it of course and will be resistant, trying to anchor itself into something, anything to avoid Absolute Nothingness and Total ONENESS.
</p>

Consciousness itself is prior to space, time, and motion.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Undifferentiated Consciousness is so nondual, it's like an infinite singularity, where nothing is distinct. The distinction between moving vs not-moving hasn't been made yet.
</p>

<p>
	All distinctions are part of the Creation. They are all forms.

			If God is existence or consciousness, what does it matter if we say God is existence or existence is existence? The majority believe God is a personified thing, we invented a personified God, we gave God a personality, now we found out that this not the case. Existence is non-personal, impersonal. Consciousness/existence exists, God does not. An ultimate causer may exists, but there is no need to call it anything, not God, nor anything.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It matters a lot. God is not merely "existence" or "consciousness". God is God. It's the actual God. Existence is deeply personal.
</p>

<p>
	The word "God" is the most accurate word. More accurate than "existence" or "consciousness". The problem is, very few of you here have actually directly experienced God.
</p>

<p>
	God is all-powerful, all-loving, infinite, intelligent, omniscient, deeply personal, eternal, formless, awesome, terrifying, magical, divine, singular, deeply paradoxical, has human-like qualities, and utterly beyond the human mind's ability to comprehend.
</p>

<p>
	Call it whatever you like, but it's there to be discovered.
</p>

<p>
	The word "God" is not confusing because it is wrong, but because it is right, but you have no reference experience for that word in your mind. I might as well be talking about colors to a blind mole rat.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	First, you awaken to discover there is no God.
</p>

<p>
	Then, you awaken deeper and discover how stupid you were the whole time for denying it.

		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	That in an interesting clue.
</p>

<p>
	450ug of LSD is A LOT. That should have been a hairy trip. I can trip balls on 125ug of LSD.
</p>

<p>
	3g of mushrooms is a decent dose, enough for a nice strong trip.
</p>

<p>
	If 450ug of LSD doesn't work on you, you've either got fake, watered-dose LSD, or you have a pretty high tolerance. I wouldn't be able to walk on 450ug.
</p>

<p>
	Seem like this is why the 5-MeO isn't working. You probably need a higher dose.

</p>

<p>
	I think one of our Mods hid some of his content because of finding it offensive. Can't recall exactly. I was under the assumption his content is still mostly visible.
</p>

<p>
	Even when we ban members, their content almost never gets deleted.
</p>

<p>
	Mouse became rather obnoxious in style/tone in the week up to his banning. And I was actually on retreat in Hawaii when it happened. His ideas were never the issue, it was the edgy and insolent tone with which he expressed himself that got him banned. Most of his ideas I agreed with.

<p>
	Rectal or snort, doesn't make much difference, as long as you don't lose any of the substance to drip.
</p>

<p>
	Rectal is the far superior method vs snorting.
</p>

<p>
	It might take a few tries to perfect the method. Took me about 5 tries to really get the method down. Sometimes, if it's injected too shallow, it doesn't work as well.

Some people seem to report that 5-MeO doesn't work effectively on them. I think this is due to two key factors: 1) your brain chemistry, which is slightly different for everyone, 2) your level of mental and spiritual development.
</p>

<p>
	I think 5-MeO works much more effectively on certain kinds of minds than others.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I think it's not enough to just take 5-MeO, it's also very important to existentially question reality. If you are not deeply questioning the nature of your reality all the time, then psychedelics will probably not be very profound for you.
</p>

<p>
	How much self-inquiry have you done?
</p>

<p>
	25mg is a very strong dose for me. It's almost unbearably infinite.
</p>

<p>
	At 25mg, I cannot even remember that I ever existed. All notion of personal self disappears in a very shocking way.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind, that I had to build up to this. I didn't get that on my first or second trip. It took many trips on various substances to get to this point. And I was doing a lot of existential/metaphysical questioning along the way.
</p>

<p>
	Also, people have different tolerances for psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	That 5-MeO powder looks fairly clean.
</p>

<p>
	It would be good if you had a sense of how sensitive/tolerant you are towards other psychedelics, like mushrooms or LSD. That would help you understand your 5-MeO experiences.
</p>

So yoga has proven challenging for me.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, lots of yoga can work. You just gotta build up to it. And I did not come at this enlightenment thing from a yoga background, I came at it from a self-inquiry background.
</p>

<p>
	But also, keep in mind, a state of Samadhi is not enlightenment.

Using different words for similar things.
</p>

<p>
	Also, keep in mind, there are various degrees of liberation and enlightenment. Is Martin as awake as someone like Sadhguru? Obvious not. But that's not something to hold against him.
</p>

<p>
	I'd say he's done pretty well for himself given the fact that he hasn't done 40 years of full-time practice.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta compare realistically. Comparing yourself to someone like Sadhguru is absurd. You might as well start comparing yourself to Schwarzenegger. You ain't ever gonna get to his level if you're hanging around on this forum. You would have to dedicate your entire life to that. And you should have started back when you were 12 years old.
</p>

<p>
	You need to temper your expectations proportionally to how many hours per day you're ready to invest in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't it interesting how that can read two ways?
</p>

<p>
	1) Become enlightened, 2) Create an Islamic state.

<p>
	From what I can tell after questioning him fairly in-depthly in private communications. Yes.
</p>

<p>
	Although it seems he got very lucky because he himself does not know a single other person who has become enlightened after 5-MeO. I think Martin was just primed and ready for it, and the 5-MeO pushed him over the edge. He did about 10 trips plus some dozen N,N-DMT trips. And he smokes it, so they were probably some very powerful trips.

<p>
	Saying "Reality is virtual" is identical to saying "Reality is Nothing" or "Reality is an illusion" or "Reality is a hallucination" or "Reality is consciousness".
</p>

<p>
	Although I don't think Campbell actually realizes that it's not only virtual, but also infinite, and that time is NOT fundamental.
</p>

<p>
	I don't consider Campbell enlightened. Although his teachings are quite good. He's missing the final crowning insight of nonduality.

	Then why were the last two Matrix movies so terrible?
</p>

<p>
	Too much showboating, not enough metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	Wasted opportunity. I was hoping they would go deep with it and reveal that even the outside-the-Matrix world is also an illusion. There are no AIs. The Matrix is not happening inside a computer, but inside another Matrix, to infinity, with no beginning or end.
