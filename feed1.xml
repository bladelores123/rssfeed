	I was too uncharitable to call him "a hack". To be more precise, he's just ideologically stuck in a Blue/Orange worldview. That's really my only issue with him.
</p>

<p>
	I don't wish him any personal suffering. I don't see him a fraud or charlatan. His heart is in the right place, it's just clouded by ideology.

<p>
	I see your question. Okay, yeah, in that case you need to factor in development psychology and the moral developmental line. Yes, as people become more educated and conscious thanks to the order and peace and technology afforded by the unification under monopoly of force, eventually they develop a higher sense of love and selflessness, which then leads to things like abolition of slavery, women's rights, civil rights, gay rights, police reform, etc.

	I find him sincere.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see why you must call him a failed philosopher or insincere. You simply have a different worldview than his.
</p>

<p>
	His show was about as successful as you could expect it to be and it seems like he earned his success through hard work on his show. Why begrudge him for that?

			So say in the beginning a group of friends created a gang/syndicate to oppress the people around them. Now they have monopoly of force in that community, and a hierarchy. Basically a tribe. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Now the question is why would they give up that “privileged” position in the hierarchy? Because we see all societies democratize overtime.

<p>
	Well, just look at how it worked historically. The history books tell us what happened.
</p>

<p>
	Kings unified warring tribes. People accepted it because as bad as a king might be, warring tribes are worse. But once all the tribes are unified under one banner and culture for some centuries, people start to wonder why they need a king. Why can't they rule themselves as one unified nation? The king also usually becomes corrupt with power by this point. And so they stage a revolution to overthrow the king and put in place some kind of legislature and constitution which distributes the power to more than one person at the top. Voting rights are eventually established. Then voting rights get expanded to more and more ordinary people, not just aristocrats.
</p>

<p>
	Of course kings, aristocrats, and elites never give up their power willingly. They must be forced into to.
</p>

<p>
	Look at the police protests right now. The police are not willing to give up their power, but the mob of people is stronger than them and will take away some of the police's power because the police have been using their power recklessly.

<p>
	The biggest problem with debunking libertarians is anticipating their level of denial and foolishness.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to nail jello to the wall.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarian philosophy is so abstract and idealistic that it's very hard to debunk.

<p>
	BTW, the European refugee immigration issue is a legitimate one. You can certainly make a valid point that a society can only integrate so many people from less developed countries. But this point needs to be made very carefully, based on science, not based on nationalism and ethnocentrism. If you want to limit the number of immigrants to a country, that's a legit discussion we could have. You will need to provide some studies/proof which shows that your country cannot accommodate more immigrants.

<p>
	Nah... You can broadcast sexual intent early on. Just don't make it explicit. It's subtle.

<p>
	I often broadcast sexual intent with physical touch super early on. The way I touch her, she knows this isn't patty-cakes. Physical touch is HUGE!

<p>
	And I enjoy long-term relationships with the right girl. I'm not really big on one night stands.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a deep topic. Like I said, you should be careful and responsible not to hurt girls too much. Obviously don't mislead them about your intentions.
</p>

<p>
	At a nightclub, one night stands are so common that the issue of a long-term relationship won't even come up in many cases since both of you know it was just a casual fling. But if you start seeing her repeatedly, yeah, she will start to expect a relationship, in which case you gotta be clear with her about what you want.
</p>

<p>
	I suggest you don't see a girl repeatedly unless you really like her and are willing to commit.
</p>

			What the line between that and being just a part of her entertainment of the night? Cause yeah sometimes they laugh even a lot but that doesn't mean that they are willing to sleep with you, they might just find you a funny guy, kind of like a dancing monkey. So how do you avoid that?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Easy. That's avoided with strong sexual intent and man-woman interaction. You need to be staring her down like a juicy piece of meat. She will feel that off you. This is not a friendly social conversation. She must feel within the first 2 minutes that if you get her alone in a room, you're going to fuck her. You need to broadcast sexual intent without ever saying anything sexual.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you could say within the first 2 minutes: "OMG, you are so yummy. I could bite into you like a juicy piece of watermelon." Then immediately switch to another topic without waiting for her response. After you say that, she will clearly know you aren't playing patty-cakes.
</p>

<p>
	But the best thing is just look her in the eyes like you want to fuck her. She will know. Nothing needs to be said.
</p>

<p>
	There are so many subtle ways to broadcast sexual intent.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but will you pursue spirituality until your sexual cravings are at least somewhat quelled? Probably not.

<p>
	Be careful with that one. It's a bit too edgy.
</p>

<p>
	Dial the edge down to a manageable point. You can say something like, "You are adorable like a little pig." It's a nice backhanded compliment because no girl wants to be called a pig. But if she gets offended you can always insist, "But baby pigs are so cute! Why do you hate piglets? Are you racist?"
</p>

<p>
	By that point you will have totally scrambled her mind. You can then switch to a serious topic.
</p>

<p>
	It's not lies per se. It's just being playful. DO NOT BE SERIOUS when talking to girls. Everything is a joke. Nothing matters. That's the proper attitude. You invest no emotional attachment in the interaction until she shows serious interest.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, making her laugh and making yourself laugh is the key. If you can make a girl laugh consistently she will get attracted to you very fast.
</p>

<p>
	A great way to go about this is to flip your love inside out.
</p>

<p>
	So, instead of saying "I love you", say "I hate you :)"
</p>

<p>
	"I hate you" is a great opener.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than saying, "will you marry me today?" it's much better to say, "I will never marry you. I will just use you and throw you away."
</p>

<p>

<p>
	I mean... you can make any line work in theory. But generally you don't want to come off as needy or desperate for love or sex.
</p>

<p>
	One time I slept with a girl after grabbing her while she was walking by and telling her, "I'm looking for a wife." She looked at me and said, "I'm looking for a husband." Bam! Instant green-light! 5 minutes later we were making out. 15 minutes later I pulled her to the hotel bathroom for sex but security kicked us out. 30 minutes later we were driving to her hotel room for sex.
</p>

<p>
	Again, what matters is not the words in your line, it's how your delivering it and how you follow up.
</p>

<p>
	You can open with almost any dumb line as long as it isn't instantly creepy or sexual.
</p>

<p>
	The dumbest openers work, like, "You will be my Pokemon." Usually the dumber you are, the more girls love it. Be dumb, but not creepy or sexual.
</p>

	How exactly does Penguinz0 imagine pickup works? You walk to up any random woman and she falls in love with you?
</p>

<p>
	In pickup you get blown out so much. Most of your sets go nowhere. But if you do 20 sets in a day, a few of them will hook hard. Getting blown out of sets is actually very important as it shows you're putting yourself on the line and it builds your confidence and ability to handle rejection.
</p>

It's an instant turn off for girls. It makes you look far too desperate and creepy.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, it's easy to record flashy and edgy pickup videos. But that does not equate to good game because in real life it's far too strong and scares the girls away. You want to be more chill and normal.
</p>

<p>
	Do not talk about sex with her unless she's already attracted to you and you're close to having sex with her. And even then you should avoid it since it's too explicit and will make her feel like a cheap slut. Guys love sexual humor, women usually don't.
</p>

<title>Is The Latest Video About Libertarianism or Anarchism?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/51091-is-the-latest-video-about-libertarianism-or-anarchism/?do=findComment&amp;comment=660047</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	My examples were deliberately extreme to highlight the absurdity of people who argue for "freedom". But there is an enormous range of people who argue for it. Some people may be total anarchists while others might be pro military and even pro taxes, but still complain about things like regulation of car pollution or regulation of wild salmon fisheries in Alaska.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter what size gov you're okay with because all sizes of government are relative. So even if some libertarian says that he is okay with some federal government, all my points from the video still apply to him. Because he will still be arguing for deregulation on the grounds that bureaucracy infringes on his personal freedoms.
</p>

<p>
	A libertarian is one who complains about government regulation regardless of how big or small his government happens to be. He always feels oppressed and inconvenienced because he fundamentally doesn't understand the necessities of government.
</p>

<p>
	I should have made this more clear in the video, since libertarians who are somewhat okay with federal government will now use this as an excuse to ignore all my points -- which still all apply to them.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, dummy.
</p>

<p>
	Girls will never call a guy cute unless they are attracted.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to tell if she's attracted is by how attentive she is when you talk, how willing she is to follow your lead, and how willing she is to hold deep eye contact. If she's looking deep in your eyes, she's willing to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	Also, if she's willing to let you touch her body, she's willing to sleep with you.

<p>
	RSD is about becoming as natural as you can. The problem is how to become natural when you aren't one to begin with?
</p>

<p>
	True naturals tend to be highly extroverted, charismatic, social, confident, and experienced from a very young age. So you can't get that without doing thousand of clumsy approaches. Natural is the end result of years of nonstop effort and mastery. It will all feel highly unnatural when you start. Don't let that stop you. Naturalness comes with experience and skill.

<p>
	Yes, you will still require at least a year or two to get decent. There's more to it than mere confidence. You have to learn how to deal with all the obstacles that girls will throw in your face as you try to pull them home. You will lose hundreds of girls due to small mistakes you make. It's impossible to be born into life just knowing how to navigate all these obstacles. This is a skill that must be cultivated through practice and experience.

<p>
	Well, America was founded by religious fanatics basically. And since Europe had a lot more religious conflict over the years, I think they learned their lesson and found peace in secularism.

<p>
	Hard to say. There are probably dozens of nuanced factors.

<p>
	Obama's demeanor was actually a good feel of Yellow. He was chill, neutral, moderate, openminded, a deep thinker, professorial, non-dogmatic, willing to negotiate with the other side, etc.
</p>

<p>
	In practice his politics wasn't so progressive, but his demeanor was Yellowish.

	I like how the stupidity of one buffoon (Trump) flushes out the stupidity of a second (Kanye), which flushes out a third (Musk).
</p>

<p>
	It's like the stupidity which used to be locked away for fear of embarrassment is now flaunted in public with pride. Showing us exactly who these people are.
</p>

<p>
	Birds of a narcissistic feather flock together.

<p>
	Don't. Just do pickup when you're doing pickup, and do meditation when you sit to meditate.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			I have been doing pickup for about 1 year. Due to covid i have not been able to do it for about 4 months though. I am getting good. Can get numbers and dates, but i am very short guy 5'2". I want to improve my game. So, provide me some suggestion. Especially on using meditation on the field.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	If you can get numbers and dates, clearly you're getting attraction, so what are you insecure about? As far as your insecurity goes, what you need to get through your thick skull is this: within about 15 minutes you will either reach hook-point with a girl or not. If you reach hook-point, you will clearly see that she's attracted. Once you see that, you know she is willing to fuck you if you just don't screw it up from here on out and handle the logistics well. So drop any insecurity from here. You KNOW she's willing to fuck you. And if a girl agrees to go on a date with you: YOU KNOW SHE'S WILLING TO FUCK YOU. A girl will never agree to go on a date with a guy she's not willing to fuck.
</p>

<p>
	Your insecurity should be about those initial 15 minutes to reach hook-point. If you get there, you've won! She's willing to fuck you. Which means your looks are now irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	One of the best guys I knew in game was a short 5'2" Pakistani guy. He was amazing. He got more girls than me at 6'2".
</p>

<p>
	Your PERSONALITY is what matters. Focus on improving that. Become charming and bold and you will attract many girls.
</p>

<p>
	YES! Of-fucking-course you are. We all are. I was hugely insecure about my looks. I didn't believe I could ever attract a hot girl. When I first started it seemed impossible, like a fantasy.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It certainly plays a role, but most guys seriously overestimate its importance. You will be shocked how hot of girls you will attract if you approach enough.
</p>

<p>
	One of the coolest things I learned is that I can attract the hottest girl in the club. You can attract porn star hotness level girls. Because girls are primarily attracted to strong personality, not looks.
</p>

<p>
	If you have above average looks, that certainly helps. It will be easier.

<p>
	That's enough get to hot girls.
</p>

<p>
	Girls don't judge your looks as much as you judge theirs. See? That's your problem. You're projecting.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can get very technical about game.
</p>

<p>
	But that's not good for newbies. When you're just starting out you want to focus on the bare basics like your dress, grooming, approaching consistently, building decent state, eye contact, smiling, body posture, physical escalation, never running out of things to say, and leading.
</p>

<p>
	The most important things are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Going out at least 2x-3x nights a week, consistently
	</li>
	<li>
		Approaching consistently
	</li>
	<li>
		Putting yourself into a good mood while you do so
	</li>
	<li>
		Smiling and laser eye contact
	</li>
	<li>
		Getting good at never running out of things to say. Becoming good at holding conversation
	</li>
	<li>
		Communicating with her man-to-woman, with clear sexual intent
	</li>
	<li>
		Immediate physical escalation
	</li>
	<li>
		Leading her
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That will get you 90% of your results. Getting decent at all the above will take you several years of full time work.
</p>

And one more question, every time I decide to go to that direction and learn more about attraction and girls practically, I tend to stop and postpone because I think that I'm just not good enough and if I fixed this thing here and that thing there, then I will be ready to go and do it.

<p>
	Yes, just do it. But you need a strong vision of why you're doing it and what you hope to get out of it. Otherwise there's no way you'll be motivated enough to push through the hard times.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you have serious life problems holding you back, it's nice to solve those. Although you can find ways to do pickup without spending any money.
</p>

<p>
	At the very least you can go out twice a week on Fri and Sat. You can work and still do pickup at night or weekends.

<p>
	All of them are valuable. Tyler's are great of course. You gotta sort through it all and see which ones resonate with you.
</p>

<p>
	When I started pickup I had a giant torrent of like every possible pickup teaching in the last 20 years. I studied the shit out of it for 100s of hours. I studied it harder than I studied calculus in college, LOL. And that was before RSD's best free YT material was fully released. That was like 8 years ago now.
</p>

<p>
	God, I'm getting old.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of great new pickup material has been released since then. I started out studying Mystery Method, LOL. I studied like 20 different teachers and coaches. All of it was useful, but RSD I liked the most because it was so brutally realistic and down-to-earth. I don't like fluff in my dating teachings.

<p>
	I started at 26-27 in that position. I had a lot to learn.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, at that age you want to get started right away. It will get harder and harder the older you get. 24-25 is the perfect age to get into pickup. Although Covid-19 obviously killed it for the next year.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Street and day game is my fave. It works even better since there's almost zero competition.
</p>

<p>
	One of the best things I got from my 2000 approaches is that these days if I see a cute girl at Wholefoods, I can fairly effortlessly just walk up to her and walk away with her number.
</p>

		<p>
			According to RSD your chances of picking her up are low since probably you didn't built much state during the day or what do you do with a woman you meet through social circle during the day?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Once you get good enough, building state will not be so important. Especially during the day where you should be more low-key and normal.
</p>

<p>
	Once you get good at pickup, social circle will be like shooting fish in a barrel. It's so easy. Normal dating becomes so easy.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup in loud clubs is like Navy Seals training. If you can handle that you can handle anything.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Clown around, somehow transfer your state? Like if the law of state transference were all there was, a horny raper would be the best at picking up chicks and getting them horny. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course there's a lot more to it than one law. And state transference is not about clowning around, it's about being grounded, chill, confident, happy, etc. rather than terrified or anxious to be near a girl. Your fear will transfer to her so fast.
</p>

<p>
	State transference is such a powerful principle. It even applies when you're talking to your girlfriend over the phone. Whatever mood you're in will quickly rub off onto her. It's important to understand this principle and use it to lead girls into positive states.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup gets very advanced and nuanced as you get a few years into it. There are hundreds of nuances to learn, but you cannot learn them unless you do 1000s of approaches. I could talk about the nuances of pickup for 20 hours straight to a newbie.
</p>

<p>
	I could talk for several hours just about the nuances of setting up the first date to make sure it's most successful. I spent dozens of hours just honing my first date process.
</p>

<p>
	Every part of your game needs to be finely-honed like knife: your dress, your grooming, the approach, the opener, body language, sub-communication, state, small talk, kino escalation, flirting, leading, asking screening questions, logistics, bouncing, managing her friends, managing her excuses, getting phone numbers, texting, setting up dates, isolation, closing, dealing with last minute resistance, foreplay, sex, etc.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You do need a solid city for pickup. I highly recommend moving to big city. It's worth it.
</p>

<p>
	I would look for a torrent of their entire old-school video catalogue. Not their paid material but their free YT videos. That stuff is GOLD. I'm sure it exists online somewhere.

			But what core techniques? I see some good shit in RSD that has helped me but most of it is a numbers game revolved "just have fun, be alpha, be an approach machine" which is too vague, and in my experience more effective on US women, and very less on Europeans.<br />
			<br />
			Most of what they teach is based around doing so much approaches that of course you'll get laid, but there is not much skill or deep inner work involved.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, that hardcore approach machine mentality is basically what you need to gain massive skills and results. It works in Europe and elsewhere of course. It works anywhere there are lots of women.
</p>

<p>
	But they also taught many fundamental inner game principles such as law of state transference, building up state, and much more. Those principles are crucial.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to get good with attracting women without MASSIVE approach experience. You need to be approaching 1000s of women. Everything else is secondary. You will learn the details as you force yourself to approach.
</p>

<p>
	I approached something like 2000 women within a year. And that was still just the start of the learning process. I never got super good at it. But I got A LOT better than when I started.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about sleeping with 100s of women. You'll be lucky to get a small handful from those 2000 approaches. It's about honing your skills and inner game through massive exposure and experience. It's about building yourself up as a man. Any future girlfriend you have will appreciate the strength pickup has built in you for her.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is like meditation. You must do it seriously to get results. It's one of the most challenging things you'll do in your life. But also one of the most rewarding.

	If you haven't seen the HBO mini-series House Of Saddam, you should go watch it now. It's one of the best things HBO has ever produced, and shows you how stage Red functions.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a preview:

<p>
	So Trump can just tweet whatever the hell he wants without repercussions?
</p>

<p>
	What if he tweeted, "Fuck the gays. Fuck the blacks." Twitter should just sit by and allow that?

<p>
	Line has to be drawn somewhere.

	Sam Jackson's character arc in Pulp Fiction is going from Red gangster to stage Blue man of God. It's a nicely realistic arc. Many gangsters do in fact get converted to the "good life" by discovering stage Blue religion and renouncing their stage Red devilish ways.

<p>
	There is a HUGE difference. Stage Orange is materialistic and hedonistic, but it is not ruthlessly violent, power-hungry, or impulsive. Orange is rational. Red is not.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Orange is your typical bank CEO. Stage Red is a Tony Soprano or Joe Pesci from Casino. The bank CEO might manipulate within business to make some big money but he will not stab you in the throat in the process. Stage Red will.

<p>
	You have to really appreciate the ruthlessness and impulsiveness of Red:

			The way I see it, this is an exaggeration. Women can be indifferent to a guy for a while and gradually become very attracted due to behavioral cues that were simply not recognized in the beginning. From a man's perspective, sure, the first few minutes. For a woman... more often than not, I don't think so.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course for a guy this is more prominent, but even for women, attraction usually happens within 10 to 15 minutes. By the end of the first date the attraction should be very solid. If it isn't, something's probably wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Women can read non-visual and non-verbal cues quickly. I'm not just talking purely about physical appearance. They needs to be "chemistry". You can feel for it.

	It is possible to take their core techniques and leave behind everything else.
</p>

<p>
	That's basically what I did. Their core techniques are SOLID and they will get you laid. As for their juvenile ways and ideology, that you can just ignore.
</p>

<p>
	It's a good skill to learn to be able to cherrypick teachings, taking only those parts which you want.

<p>
	There is SO MUCH dating material available online. Dig around and try various sources until you find what resonates with you. People require different teachers and styles, depending on their goals.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the most direct and hard dating advice, RSD is the best. If you want to sleep with the most and hottest women possible, RSD is the way. But for some guys that may be too hardcore.

<p>
	Nothing is wrong with you at all. This is exactly how it works.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be free of the cycle, then stop dating. Dating and relationships are fundamentally a cycle of highs and lows. You're NEVER going to find freedom or peace through them.
</p>

<p>
	Or, decide to ride the cycles and stomach the highs and lows. In dating and relationships, every joy will basically end up compensated by some heartbreak or hurt. There is no free lunch in dating/relationships.
</p>

<p>
	If you want stable joy, that can only be found within yourself. It cannot be gotten via others, since others are never stable.
</p>

What is it about him exactly that you don't find attractive? This sounds like a deeper issue than him merely not performing in bed.
</p>

<p>
	Sexual attraction is a crucial component of relationships and it must be screened for from the very beginning. You must be into the other person on a sexual level, and not just a little bit, but a lot. Otherwise even if everything else is good, that part can never be fixed. Attraction is not a conscious choice. You can't work your way into it later.
</p>

<p>
	You should screen for sexual attraction and chemistry within the first few minutes and hours of meeting a person. You have to train yourself to ask yourself, "On a scale of 1 to 10 how satisfied would I feel fucking this guy?" and if it's below a 7 or 8, you should move on, otherwise you'll end up wasting your time and his time.

<p>
	Religion is a big factor. Northern Europe is more secular and so its government is not corrupted as much by stage Blue religious fundamentalism as American government is.
</p>

<p>
	Religious conservatism is holding back America's development in the same way that Islamic fundamentalism is holding back the Middle East. When people are too ideological, they don't make empirical decisions.

<title>Why do Christians feel like they’re under attack?</title>

<p>
	It's simple: because stage Blue Christianity IS under attack. It is becoming more and more of an untenable ideology to hold in the 21st century. Stage Blue Christians are correct in their fear that stage Blue Christianity is slowly dying and will soon die.

<p>
	You see Jesus as a radical leftist, but that is not how a stage Blue Christian sees Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different versions of Christianity. Don't assume that just because someone values Jesus that their worldview is the same as yours. Not at all.
</p>

<p>
	People don't see Jesus as he was, but as he fits into their worldview and personal needs. This has always been the case. We have no objective accounts of how Jesus actually was. It's all interpretations by people who admired him.

One might think the defenseless women are being brutalized by the warriors, but it's quite the contrary. The women in the painting (the "Sabine women") are actually intervening in order to stop the fighting between the two groups - the Romans and the Sabines. And the shocking thing? It actually works, the Romans and the Sabines agree to stop fighting and live happily ever-after (lol wtf), a strange outcome considering these times were rife with barbarity.

<p>
	Yes, of course. Which is a good metaphor for femininity stepping in to stop toxic masculinity at stage Red.

<p>
	There is a huge different between book-smarts and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	There are millions of smart people in the world, but very few wise ones.
</p>

<p>
	One of the problems of stage Orange is that it confuses smarts for wisdom, when the two are often at opposite ends of a line.
</p>

<p>
	Academia does not teach wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	Wouldn't be awesome if Trump was forced off Twitter and ended up posting on 4chan? Then the mainstream media would be like, "Today the President says so and so on 4chan."
</p>

<p>
	Trump is basically the 4chan President.

<p>
	God is unlimited. An unlimited thing can create itself, since it is unlimited.
</p>

<p>
	The inability to create oneself is a limit.
</p>

<p>
	If God could not create itself, it would be limited, which is impossible since ONENESS requires that all limits be self-imposed.
</p>

<p>
	If everything is ONE, that means the creator and creation are identical.
</p>

<p>
	You really gotta appreciate that unlimited means ABSOLUTE UNLIMITED! Zero fucking limits!

<p>
	Well, it is true that "The Establishment" will not be friendly to fringe, radical ideas which undermine mainstream consensus. But what needs to be acknowledged is that this is not purely some evil establishment plot. It's just the very nature of how mainstream things work. Mainstream things tend to exclude niche things. And this is sometimes good because niche things can be toxic. At least the mainstream stuff has been field-tested to work at scale. Niche ideas have not.
</p>

<p>
	So of course Google will censor stuff like anti-vax conspiracy theories because it simply goes against mainstream science and Google is not going to go against mainstream science.
</p>

<p>
	Huge companies are going to try to accommodate the middle of the road of their customer base. They will avoid fringe wacky stuff that few people are into.
</p>

<p>
	It's like Kyle and progressives don't understand that any time you challenge the status quo, it will push back. That's the whole challenge of making progress. OF COURSE all the giant companies and platforms will not be friendly to radical progressive voices. That is not their job. Their job is to serve the mainstream.
</p>

<title>DMT vs 5-MEO-DMT according to Qualia Computing</title>

<p>
	I've done a lot of 5-MeO and DMT, and the generalizations in that article of their difference do not match my experiences at all.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot draw such conclusions from a few interviews or case studies. Psychedelics affect people extremely differently such that drawing generalizations about what the trip will be like is very difficult.
</p>

<p>
	I hardly experience visuals on DMT. And no entities.
</p>

<p>
	I would hesitate to make the bold conclusion, as the article does, that 5-MeO-DMT is superior for dealing with trauma. I think this will vary from person to person. I personally don't find 5-MeO-DMT that useful for doing shadow work. Lesser psychedelics like mushrooms or LSD might be better for that.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want a robust solution to this issue, you need to give each patient 5 or 10 different psychedelics and have him tell you which ones give him benefits in which categories, such as healing trauma, shadow work, awakening, etc. Experimentation for each patient is crucial. There cannot be a single solution that works for everyone because of how differently our bodies and brains metabolize these chemicals.
</p>

			So Leo, what is your opinion then on the future of AI?  Is it "impossible" to generate artificial consciousness?  It is very easy to create organic life, and there seems to be no "limitation" on organic production, so why would God limit our ability to bestow consciousness on machine life?  
		</p>

		<p>
			If the brain channels infinite consciousness into finite consciousness, shouldn't an artificial brain be capable of doing the same thing?  If not, why?  If so, what does that imply?  (ie. IF conscious AI can be built, does that invalidate all of nonduality?  It would experience Being with no self, and yet be finite and limited)

	Russia has always been deeply religious. The atheism imposed by communism was just a facade. Russia is a Christian nation, as is America. It will take work to outgrow that.

<p>
	1ml of liquid is way too much.
</p>

<p>
	0.5ml is plenty.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason to use more if you're taking a large volume of substance, like 100mg of DMT. But for 5-MeO-DMT, you can easily dissolve that in 0.3 to 0.5ml.
</p>

	Of course it is. He's clueless that his own logic and cognitive process IS part of "the senses" and is even less reliable than sensation.

		<ul>
			<li>
				1 ml instead of 2 ml for faster absorbtion.
			</li>
			<li>
				you dont put it so deep in your ass like in your method (just 3-4 centimeter). This is critical, because you need to place this substance to the anal column, if you put it deeper it lands in anal rectum and there is little absorbtion.
			</li>
			<li>
				standing instead of lying is better so the substance goes down to gravity and not up to the rectal when lying.
			</li>
			<li>
				you need a  a closed external sphincter so no substance can leak out ( this point I did not understand, because he said you should relaxe this, but would a relaxing sphincter not be open? I can contract my assmuscles so no one can get in, would this not be better?? Please clarify)
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			I will try it out, thank you!
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Lol, that's 90% my method.
</p>

<p>
	I use a 1ml syringe. And it only needs to be filled up half way.
</p>

<p>
	I insert about 50-60% of the syringe. Keep in mind people have different body lengths. I'm 6'2". If you're short you may need to insert it less.
</p>

<p>
	Standing vs lying down makes little difference. It will work equally well in both way. I find it more comfortable to lay down and surrender to the trip (which comes on fast) than standing. You don't want to be standing when 5-MeO kicks in hard in 8 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Your butt hole needs to be closed obviously. It naturally closes up. Your butt hole is never just hanging open by default. You don't particularly need to do anything special with your butt hole. Nothing should leak out.
</p>

<p>
	Taking a shit beforehand is super important. I would not skip that step.
</p>

	But he seems to claim that whites have an inherently higher IQ and that this is an unchangeable fact.
</p>

<p>
	To me that's awfully close to white supremacy. And it will be taken by his audience as bolstering their racist views. It gives ammunition to racists for being racists while denying they are racists, because "science".
</p>

<p>
	The human mind loves to use "science" and "reason" to validate whatever biases it has. Because it desperately wants to ground its biases in something objective. The whole game of the mind here is to deny that its worldview and biases are purely relative, subjective, and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	Molyneux is in the business of playing that game on behalf of his ethnocentric audience. Racist people need some authority figure who will tell them that their racism isn't actually racism, and that those who call them racists are actually being unscientific.

<p>
	Hateful isn't the best word. I would describe his worldview as tormented and bitter. He's not really coming at life from a place of joy and love, but fear and worry.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know if I've ever seen him laugh during one of his lectures. He's so fucking serious. Like the gravity of existence pains him.
</p>

<p>
	You'll know he's healthy when you can see him talking about SJWs and cultural marxists and just laugh. Laughter is the appropriate response to stage Green stupidity.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, when I talk about politics and lower stage stupidity, I'm laughing half the time. I don't take such things personally because my worldview is able to accommodate it. His is not. You need to ground yourself in something deeper, something nonhuman and nonmoralistic. You must go meta and rise above the plane of petty human squabbles. Yes, some kids on college campuses are doing excessive things. So what?! Let it go and move on with your life. But instead JP's response to that is to grind his axe. That will have negative consequences for his mental well-being. He's bitter and he keeps feeding that bitterness through his public career. That would be like if I made my whole career about attacking atheists. That's a dysfunctional, reactionary direction to go. One's life's work should not be in reaction to anything humans are going.

	Is Mario's head generating the simulation? No. And yet, without a head, Mario couldn't be Mario. So the head is important. You can't just cut off Mario's head. But Mario's head is not causing the simulation, it's a small part of the larger simulation.
</p>

<p>
	Notice: No part of the simulation causes the simulation. The simulation's cause is COMPLETELY outside the plane of the simulation. There is no way for Mario to see what causes his simulated world from within the simulation. Mario would have to jump outside the simulation to understand it. Which is why humans struggle so much to resolve the mind/body problem. It cannot be resolved from inside the dream. You must awaken. You must breaknthrough the dream as a whole. You must see the whole thing as a dream. You must exit the Matrix to see what causes the Matrix. It is impossible to understand the Matrix from within the Matrix. Brains and science are all within the Matrix.

	I got 20 minutes of anesthesia done last week. Out cold. Zero consciousness. It was a pretty cool experience. Woke up feeling refreshed and alert. It kicked in so fast, like within 60 seconds I was out.

	But we don't need to wait that long. Many of those non-western parts of the world will raise themselves to the west's level in the next 50-100 years. China and India are on the way. Especially if the US doesn't bully or exploit them. It would be great progress for the US to just stop bullying others. Many South America countries were terribly exploited by the US, with their democratic populist governments undermined for corporate profit.

	This hinges on how deeply you realize that you are the entire horse race and every horse in the race. If your identity is limited to that of one particular horse, then you will only cheer for that horse.
</p>

<p>
	But it is possible to realize that you are the entire playing field -- that we are all ONE -- and that life does not have to be zero-sum game. By working harmoniously we can all profit.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives identify with one horse.
</p>

<p>
	Progressives want every horse to do well.

</p>

<p>
	What Pena is missing is that if everyone in the world becomes feminine, there won't be a need for war. So the absurdity is that he wants men to be more macho in order to protect us from other macho men. LOL

<p>
	Yes, there's no guarantee the west will remain most advanced forever. It's an endless horse race with different horses in the lead at different times.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why it's silly to make a big deal when your horse happens to gain the lead. Your horse ain't as special as you think it is just because it is your horse.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is to cheer for one horse over all the others when you could be cheering for all the horses and the whole dynamic of the race. Right-wingers make this mistake of cheer-leading for one horse. A horse is a horse, of course, of course, which means in the end every horse dies.

<p>
	The truth is we don't really know what's going on with him, so lets let him be. Only he can sort himself out anyways. Our opinions will not help him. And I hope he gets well regardless of his ideology.

It is objectively more advanced in many ways. The real problem is when you justify that with genetics, IQ, or some kind of innate superiority when the real reason has more to do with geographical and historical factors, and most importantly the situation is not hopeless or irredeemable. Underdeveloped countries and cultures are fully capable of advancing to the level of white western civilization. It will just take some time. So we don't need to treat them as hopeless, but rather help speed them along.
</p>

<p>
	And also, it's important to acknowledge the great qualities of non-western cultures. In some ways they are better and more advanced than the white west. India, for example, has crazy spiritual development which puts the west to shame.
</p>

<p>
	The general solution here is simple: start loving all cultures and peoples and treat them as if you will one day be born as one of them. Be ware of your own cultural biases and don't try to justify them like Molyneux does.

			Do you really think roughly half the country agrees with Molyneux? From what I’m reading he seems alt-right with a heavy emphasis on white supremacy, conspiracy theories like white genocide, Star Wars movies persecuting white people, an obsession with white superiority of IQ etc. . . Yet perhaps I’m underestimating white supremacy popularity. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I wouldn't say that half agrees with his exact detailed justifications of white superiority. I'd say half leans right-wing. And I think plenty of right-wingers have a vague sense that white western civilization is better than the rest because it has historically been so dominant and successful -- regardless of how you explain it. I think at least half the country is ethnocentric, feeling like their race and culture is the best.
</p>

<p>
	Ethnocentrism is a more nuanced thing than racism. Stage Green SJW types would benefit from making that distinction. It's easy to call people racist when really they are stuck in ethnocentrism. They are unable to see beyond their bias towards their culture and ethnicity. Such people are not nazis, facists, or explicit racists.
</p>

<p>
	I would say, for example, that my mother is ethnocentric. She def has biases against blacks and others simply given her upbringing, but not in an openly racist way. It's subtle. I think A LOT of people are like that. At least 50% of the world population. You can call such people racist but you are going to turn them against you and make them stubbornly defensive. They will never admit they are racist.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if I married a black girl, that would def disturb her. I think that is super common in the boomer generation.

	This is a tricky thing. The problem with any ideology is that it tends to radicalize people and things escalate quickly even when the original founders don't intend them to. Very tricky to regulate that. Lots of grey zone.

	Overall I'd say Molyneux was very much in the grey zone. Which makes it so tricky.

<p>
	Well, it can take a while to figure out how to use psychedelics proper for you. It requires experimentation.

	The thing about how worldviews and ideology works is that one is a true believer. One feels entitled and fully justified to one's worldview by definition.

			I think a huge part of the problem is the way YouTube functions and is monetized, everyone is reliant on keeping their echo chamber in tact or and if they stray too far in developing themselves or displease their audience in any significant way, it starts to crumble everything they've built up. And god forbid they lose some money trying to become better people in the process! Can't have that!

<p>
	I don't think he was corrupted by money in this case. He's just a true believer in his ideology. He does not recognize it as an ideology.

<p>
	He doesn't see his worldview as useless or racist. He sees it as crucial and scientific/realistic.
</p>

<p>
	All this just boils down to a difference in worldview. And all worldviews are relative.
</p>

<p>
	The whole problem of racism is that racists never see themselves as racists, they see themselves as realists. It takes deep self-reflection to recognize one's own racists justifications as self-biased. This requires radical openmindedness and painful self-honesty.
</p>

<p>
	Being a philosopher, Molyneux fell into the trap of turning his philosophy into an identity which he is now committed to surviving and reproducing. It's not about money for him, it's about his pride and his identity. He's a very idealistic guy. Personally I wish him well. I think he has a good heart, although of course I don't agree with his ideas on race, IQ, and the superiority of Western European culture. He simply does not understand development psychology or how consciousness evolves.
</p>

<p>
	Banning someone like Molyneux might end up backfiring moreso than banning someone like Alex Jones. Molyneux is someone who could be debated and reasoned with. Driving this stuff underground could be like sweeping food under the kitchen rug.

	Paradox is what happens when the dualistic mind -- which divided the world -- is finally forced to confront the consequences of that division in a sea of what is otherwise an Absolute Unity.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually all dualities collapse and all divisions get unified.
</p>

<p>
	Undivided = Infinity

			Molyneux is saying YT has erased all of his thousands of videos and billions of user comments. Yet that would seem like a stupid move for YT. If YT erased it all, they would be letting go of some of their power. Suppose they had to go court proceedings. Those videos and user comments could come in handy.

</blockquote>

<p>
	As I said above, of course it can be a tool in that way. If some angry, pissy kid wants to use heavy metal music to overcome his homicidal desire to shoot up a school full of children, excellent! That is a good trade. There is value in that.
</p>

<p>
	But also consider that basically anything can be a processing tool, including violence and murder.
</p>

<p>
	Torturing kittens might help a homicidal person to not commit homicide. But that doesn't mean torturing kittens is a high consciousness activity.
</p>

<p>
	For example, when I was a kid, I liked to shoot animals with bee-bee guns. Killed some birds and things. Then one time I saw up close a bird that I fatally shot, but it wasn't dead yet. It was suffering. Seeing that made me feel so guilty that I stopped shooting animals from then on. So basically torturing animals made me a better more compassionate and conscious adult.

<p>
	Of course not!
</p>

<p>
	You need to carefully think through what your words mean.
</p>

<p>
	"A single undivided item" << Okay, if you do that, you have Infinity. One thing. There cannot be two undivided things! You can't add together two undivided things, they must be divided to begin with for there to be two of them.
</p>

<p>
	You can add together two divided things. But what constitute "a thing" is already relative to how your mind carves up the world. The world is not made up of things. Your minds projects division on the world and calls those conceptual divisions things. But even if you get past all that, there is no guarantee whatsoever that by combining two random things you will be left with 2. There are many instances in nature where you add 1 and 1 and get something that isn't 2. Fundamentally there is no reason why you couldn't add two things together and get 0, for example. You could design a virtual reality in which 1+1=0. Or whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	And none of this in independent of a sentient being because it's all happening inside your sentience. If not, where else is addition happening?
</p>

<p>
	Even just the very notion of addition itself, is relative. After all, what is addition and how do you even understand it? Is addition something found in the outer world? Of course not.

</ul>

<p>
	If you were a donkey, 1+1=2 would not be true for you. How is this not obvious to you? 1+1=2 cannot be true for you unless you are able to think it and tell yourself that it is true.

<p>
	I agree with Bret. Technically, it may not be murder in the classical meaning of that word. Police are given lots of legal leeway in dealing with people who resist arrest.
</p>

<p>
	Of course that doesn't mean it was appropriate or that laws/regulations shouldn't change.
</p>

<p>
	Bret is just being very precise and cautious. Which most people don't want these days. They are outraged and want action. So that's the disconnect here. Both sides have their merit. It's just a matter of what you prioritize higher: precision or action?
</p>

<p>
	But this is why we have courts and why we have the right for peaceful protest. Both play an important function.

<p>
	I have. You can merge with it and still come back. It's really not different than here. Here and there, forward and back get dissolved and unified such that the material world becomes part of that pure infinite consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And yet, it might still be possible to fully merge with it and never "come back". But I wouldn't worry about that at your stage.

<p>
	Actually, it really does.
</p>

<p>
	I say this, but it does not mean that anger is "bad" or wrong. It is what it is. But it is a low vibration of consciousness. High consciousness beings don't have almost any anger at all in them. It's been purified away and healed by the light of Love.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if heavy metal is part of your coping process and helps you to release your anger, then it can be valuable. But even so, once you release it you will want to move on to higher forms of music. A crutch is a great things when you have a broken leg. But once your leg heals, you throw the crutch away.

	Hehehe.... one day you will look back at the importance you placed on grades and test scores, and just laugh. It's complete pointless nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to really be intelligent, simply start doing the practices to explore and investigate your own consciousness. That will be true, embodied intelligence -- the only kind that really matters.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that's required to be an intellectual is to read books and contemplate the material deeply for yourself. That's it! Everything else is distraction and nonsense. If you can read and contemplate, you can be an intellectual. It's actually very simple, but it must be done consistently over years. You cannot become an intellectual in a month or a year.

			the way you're making fun of something so personal and expressive to people is counter-productive, IMO. Unlike say, political opinions, there's little immediate, explicit harm that music choices can have on the world, so it just seems kind of callous to tell people off for liking what they like. And yes people will naturally grow out of it the more they grow and develop in consciousness, but that's a choice they have to make themselves, not one that I think can be forced on people.

<p>
	I don't really judge it. Obviously I'm just expressing my own tastes. I'm not dumb enough to think that my tastes are somehow absolute.
</p>

<p>
	God loves heavy metal as much as anything else. But also, art exists are various levels of consciousness, and not all art has the same effect on one's consciousness. A horror film can be art, but it isn't necessarily good for your consciousness to fill your mind with images of horror.

<p>
	Actually, there is no difference. Who are you to say that a snuff film isn't art? It can be made artfully.
</p>

<p>
	Almost anything can be turned into an art, from murder to rape to cannibalism. It's all totally relative. But things do have consequences.

<p>
	I agree. He's healthy is many respects but also clearly shows that Green is not Yellow. A real shift happens at Yellow that takes away that toxic Vaush edge. Of course then you can't be as shocking and popular with the YT kids. That edginess stems from epistemic arrogance.

<p>
	Yes, what this tells you is that you two are simply not compatible personality-wise, values-wise, development-level-wise, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You MUST look for fit in new relationships. Not all people and personality types or value sets fit together. You must screen harder for this on the front end before you two fall head over heals in love.
</p>

<p>
	Muster the courage to admit to yourself that you two are not fit for each other, and move on. It is doing you both a disservice to try to make an unfit relationship work. It will not work. Relationships are hard enough even when you have great fit. When you have poor fit, forget about it.
</p>

<p>
	FIT! FIT! FIT! Look for FIT!
</p>

<p>
	When fit is found, the relationship flows naturally like a dance. Without fit it feels like grinding gears every week.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be a shortcut to doing.
</p>

<p>
	Reconnect yourself with a juicy vision for your life, and then just do it. It will feel hard and uncomfortable at first.
</p>

<p>
	A juicy vision is crucial, otherwise you can't even be motivated to try.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, breaking addictions is always hard and there is no way to avoid suffering. Which is why you should be careful not to get addicted to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	If you get addicted to heroin, there's no painless way out. You must go through the withdrawal.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Overcoming Addiction, which gives you the ultimate solution to addiction.
</p>

<p>
	But also! Don't guilt yourself too hard for watching self-help videos. This is still valuable stuff which is an investment in your future. There are much worse ways to spend your time.
</p>

	"Most republicans are degenerate sub-humans." -- Vaush
</p>

<p>
	I like this example of Green completely demonizing Blue republicans. You can see that his worldview is not yet sophisticated enough to appreciate why people have different perspectives on reality:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">

</div>

<p>
	The perfect example of a stage Green trap. Even, though, of course, his critiques of racists are pretty good. He just overgeneralizes way too much. Most republicans are NOT white supremacists or fascists.

	What's the difference? It's all going to blend together seamlessly over time to create a more optimal society. Society is constantly optimizing itself no matter who is in charge.

<p>
	I think there are actually some studies which show the effect heavy metal music vs classical music has on the mind/consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You ain't gonna find some blissed out yogi listening to heavy metal for a reason.
</p>

<p>
	Heavy metal will affect your consciousness in a similar way that watching horror movies might. The lower your consciousness the more you will gravitate towards dark, brash, aggressive material.
</p>

<p>
	Speaking of Red, I recently heard a report that one of Trump's favorite movies is Bloodsport, and when he watches it, he has his son fast-forward past all the dialogue and love scenes, to get to the bloody action. So it's just 60 minutes of pure bloody action. That's how Red operates. It sure explains a lot.

<p>
	I disagree with him on that. I don't buy into apocalyptic teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I could be wrong. We could all die tomorrow. But I'm not gonna live my life that way or tailor my teachings that way. I'm a long-term optimist. Of course shit will happen in the short-term.
</p>

<p>
	You also have to consider how important the timing is. Maybe Shunya is correct in some ultimate sense, but that doesn't mean it will happen in our lifetimes. What really matters is the next 50 years. If it ain't happening within that timeframe, don't worry about it. That's not your generation's responsibility.

<p>
	Since he's a socialist, fundamentally be believes capitalism is unsustainable and will eat itself at some point.
</p>

<p>
	And while that might be true, again, the crucial question is when? Maybe in 100 years. Or maybe never if socialist policies are gradually implemented over the next 50 years (which seems most likely to me).
</p>

<p>
	Of course crashes and recessions will happen.

<title>How to avoid hell on 5meo (did it this weekend)?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/50826-how-to-avoid-hell-on-5meo-did-it-this-weekend/?do=findComment&amp;comment=655311</link>

<p>
	Yeah... that's fear. You've got a lot of fear to surrender before you are able to realize the Love of that alien super-intelligence. You're not going to get stuck in hell forever. That's just one of your deepest fears, so of course it hits you hard.
</p>

<p>
	The reason it feels forced is because YOU forced! LOL. That's what 5-MeO-DMT is! When you sit down to smoke bufo what you are basically saying is: "Force God upon me." And so it is. Then the question is are you able to handle what you asked for? Are you able to chew what you bit off? Which is why moderate dosing is crucial. You can certainly traumatize yourself with God by taking  a large dose because by putting a chemical in your system you are brute-forcing awakening at the material level. And the material level tends to be ruthless. Gravity is not going to have compassion for you if you jump out of an airplane. Gravity will feel unloving in such a situation. But that's because you were crazy enough to jump out of an airplane. It's your job in this situation to ensure you have a parachute and know how to deploy it.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely try plugging it. Much gentler and smoother.
</p>

<p>
	Lower your dose. Don't be macho. This is not about who can do more. It's about finding the perfect dose for your current station in life.
</p>

<p>
	You will also get used to 5-MeO-DMT the more you do it. The first few times it just feels so alien, otherworldly, and confusing.
</p>

<p>
	Go slowly. Be patient. Play the long game. Take time to integrate. Trip only when you feel like you're ready for another dose of Truth. Sometimes I have to take months between trips. Don't be trying to copy me by doing some 30 days challenge bullshit. That's way too much. You should not be taking that as the standard example of how to trip. I was doing very hardcore stuff there because I wanted to test the limits.
</p>

<p>
	The levels are not discrete things. Think of it more like light. There are many degrees of light, from an LED to the sun and beyond.

<title>Is Time Fundamental?</title>

<p>
	Time is purely conceptual and imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	When you become conscious enough you can just stop imagining it. You can just forget it like you do an old childhood memory, until it pops back into your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Time is a conceptual projection of your mind. Don't confuse it with raw experience. Just because raw experience changes DOES NOT mean it happens in time. Change and time are not the same thing, even though we measure time by using change.
</p>

<p>
	Also be careful with thinking that reality occurs in frames or has a frame rate. It does not. There is one continuous field.
</p>

	First slap: Your first awakening.

<p>
	Second slap: Your 20th awakening.

<p>
	Here is a fuller analysis of the situation. It's quite awe-inspiring:

<title>Does Info Wars count as a cult?</title>

<p>
	Technically it is not a cult because it does not coerce you to be a member or prevent you from leaving.
</p>

<p>
	But effectively it is a cancer of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	The technical definition of what a cult is will have to be updated to account for this new online era we now live in, where physical coercion becomes less practical. The best kind of manipulation and corruption is not physically forceful.
</p>

<p>
	It's not false per se, it's conceptual, relative, and partial.
</p>

<p>
	There are multiple orders of reality which we can talk about. Be careful not to confuse them. Sensation is a 1st order thing. Causation is a 2nd order thing. Similar to how sand is a 1st order thing and sand castles are a 2nd order thing.
</p>

<p>
	In this inquiry we are only interested in 1st order things. So stop asking 2nd order questions.
</p>
