<title>Logistics of the cave lifestyle</title>

It will basically feel like hell. And I doubt it is sustainable for years at a time because you're gonna run out of essential supplies like food and water.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to plan it out very well and you'd have to select a spot which has sources of food and water.
</p>

<p>
	I know some yogis, for example, live on coconuts which grow nearby them. This kind of thing is easier to pull off in tropical countries I think.
</p>

<p>
	It's much more realistic to live in a small remote cabin which offers heat, small kitchen, pantry, toilet, shower, etc.
</p>

Most guys suck at sex, so it's understandable.
</p>

<p>
	But a guy who knows what he's doing can give you an amazing orgasm just through text messages, never mind in person.

<p>
	By that logic you cannot do anything in life, because there is always zero evidence to support something until you do it.

			JC recommends putting attention on each Chakra as you breath in and out. Apparently there is also a prana energy flow. To me, this feels really awkward. At times, there is a vague sense of prana flow, yet when I am imagining spots in my sacrum, belly, sternum etc. it seems like a fantasy disruption. It's like I'm trying to coordinate breathing, images of energy flow, sensations of energy flow and images of individual Chakra centers. Is it ok to just imagine energy flow up and down the spine? Rather than trying to imagine the energy passing through an images of my sacral vertebrae, then moving on through the abdomen chakra, then passing through the heart chakra etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not so hard to do all that. Just visualize the prana as an electrical fluid flowing up the center of the spine and hitting each chakra quickly along the way.
</p>

<p>
	What is so hard about that?
</p>

<p>
	Your sense is vague because this requires months of practice to get is sharp.
</p>

<p>
	Even moreso than visualization, I would literally try to FEEL the prana shooting up the spine. FEEL it, and it will become a reality soon enough. This is a case of mind over matter. Don't sell your mind short.

<p>
	You say this now only because you happen to feel good right now.
</p>

<p>
	Let's see how you feel when your dog dies, when your Mom gets cancer, when you lose your job, when you get into a car accident, when someone steals your stuff, when you start to age, when your health deteriorates, when you run out of money, when you have to face death.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea yet just how much life will make you suffer. You feel good right now, but that will definitely not last.
</p>

<p>
	Wake up!

<p>
	This is a total lie.
</p>

<p>
	That person in actually unhappy 95% of the time.
</p>

<p>
	Be ware of how you are so miserable in life you are too unconscious and scared to even admit your own misery.
</p>

<p>
	It is impossible to be unconscious and happy. Period.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically, it takes consciousness just to realize you are unhappy. As but one example, notice how you constantly live in fear. Every day of your life you have a constant cloud of fear and insecurity hanging over you. Fundamentally you feel incomplete and incapable of facing life. Fundamentally you feel broken, not good enough, and unlovable. This is not something that happens occassionally. This is the theme of your entire life!

</p>

<p>
	Do not fool yourself into thinking that any external material acheivement will ever change the above sitution. No matter how much money or sex you get, you will still be afraid, broken, and miserable. And eventually you will want to kill yourself because nothing you try will fix it. That is, unless you know about spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	The devil lies to himself that he is happy being a devil. Therein lies his tragedy. If only he would admit he is a devil, there would be hope. But he is too blind and arrogant to see it. So he continues living in his own self-created hell, calling it heaven.

<p>
	Hero With A Thousand Faces was one of the best books I read as a teen. It had a big impact on me and I still have fond memories of reading it.
</p>

<p>
	But don't expect it to be super practical like a how-to book. It is abstract, high-level wisdom which takes real thought to implement.

<p>
	Paranormal abilities do not work like that. They are not so precise that you can use them that way. It would be like asking, "Can I use my intuition to win the lottery?" No, but you can use your intuition to create a billion dollar business.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of paranormal abilities as material abilities.

<p>
	Hence the beauty of plugging. The dose is as precise as an IV injection. And you get 5-10 minutes to get yourself comfy for the blast-off. And the come-up is silky smooth, yet strong as fuck at a decent dose. And it lasts way longer, allowing for much better contemplation and integration. It also has no nasty smell or taste.
</p>

<p>
	I will verify it with N,N-DMT and let you guys know, but for 5-MeO-DMT and 2C-B it works amazing. Folks who aren't plugging are really missing out on a beautiful thing.

			I dabbled with kriya some time ago but I found Leo's suggested posture to be extremely uncomfortable for me.
		</p>

		<p>
			My legs go numb pretty quick and it becomes more about fighting pain than actually doing the practice.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've tried slight adjustments like the height of the seat but my legs still don't agree with this position at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			I tried to get used to it for like two weeks but finally gave up.
		</p>

		<p>
			Would practicing with another posture like vajrasana (which looks like this: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yI1iIMc.jpg" rel="external nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/yI1iIMc.jpg</a>) be much less effective than what Leo recommends?

	Finding a comfortable sitting position is very important. I would say, just find any sitting position you feel comfortable with which allows you to sit for a solid 60 minutes with minimal discomfort.
</p>

<p>
	Right now I've changed up my sitting position to using a Zen-style seize bench with some extra cushioning. So for the pranayamas and breath of fire I am sitting on my knees using that bench. The Mahamudra is done without a bench obviously. That's what I found works best for me.
</p>

<p>
	You could even just do it using a comfy chair.
</p>

<p>
	Again, don't let technical details get in the way of your core practice. Once your core practice is established you can always fine-tune it, change positions, add stuff, remove stuff, etc. But you need the core practice ASAP.
</p>

<p>
	There is no you to protect.
</p>

<p>
	Your question is predicated upon egotism. You are looking to survive. But there is no survival from the Absolute perspective because the Absolute cannot be killed.
</p>

<p>
	You're not getting yet that death is impossible. The only thing that dies are illusions, so there is no problem -- unless you're identified with being an illusion -- in which case you've got a BIG problem.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to change what you're identified with being.

</p>

<p>
	Questions of healthiness are always relative to what you're comparing to.
</p>

<p>
	And canned tuna ain't the same thing as fresh wild Alaskan salmon.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest concern with fish is heavy metal toxicity. You shouldn't eat too much of it.
</p>

<p>
	Stay away from predatory fish like swordfish, tuna, mackerel, shark, bass, etc. as they contain the most heavy metals. Smaller fish are generally safer than bigger fish.

</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga or mindfulness meditation with labeling will blow all that junk out of the water.
</p>

<p>
	What you need is not games but an industrial-grade practice like the two above.
</p>

<p>
	At the very least you could just sit and stare at your hand for 30 minutes straight, and that will do way more for you than those so-called brain training games.

<p>
	Science and mysticism will converge and co-evolve. But science as a conceptual activity will never really grasp the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Science must become the hand-maiden of mysticism.

	That's called mysticism. Lol. And it's been around for at least 10,000 years.

That definition of science is woefully inadequate to really understand what science is. Science is a conceptual, symbolic activity. It is impossible to do science without concepts or language. Yet no concepts are ever reality. So how do you resolve that?
</p>

<p>
	Yes, superficially science relies on observation, but then it turns those observations into a conceptual construct. Spirituality also relies on observation, but it turns observation into Being (if done properly) -- which science can never do. Science must always miss being for concept, not-knowing for knowing.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you're gonna know enlightenment, you're wrong. You can only not-know it.
</p>

<p>
	It is critical that you transcend the entire domain of knowledge. What we're talking about with spirituality is NOT knowledge! Notice how big of a problem this presents for you, since all you know, is knowledge!
</p>

<p>
	That's still too much at the level of intellect. You say that, but you're still playing the games because your ego thinks it's getting something valuable out of them.
</p>

<p>
	You haven't fully realized the significance of that statement. Relativity still runs your whole life, and you still treat the relative as though it has absolute value. Which is why you still cling to things, why you still have fear, anger, frustration, worry, negativity, etc. And why you struggle so hard to manipulate life every day, yet you keep failing and failing and disappointing yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The quantity of suffering you experience every day is a measure of how little you are conscious of the above statement. Suffering comes from not being conscious of relativity, treating the relative as absolute.
</p>

But also understand that you have not fully realized the Absolute yet. When your ego-mind is completely deconstructed, you will realize, much to your ego's shock, that all knowledge is conceptual, and not Being or Truth.
</p>

<p>
	It's gonna be quite problematic for you to do science once you're fully conscious that past & future, and cause & effect are not real.
</p>

<p>
	But if you ever reach that far, you also won't care, because by this point you'll be dead.
</p>

<p>
	And then you'll be a happy mystic without a care in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Could you still do science after that? Probably. But would you still want to? You gotta really wonder? Why do you do science at all? Why invest the time into it? What do you lack that it gives you?
</p>

<p>
	Sure, but the map is never the territory. Science is always conceptual, partial, and relative, never Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why most mystics don't care too much about science. It's an endless game of relativity.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with science is that it refuses to recognize its limits. Science is arrogant and foolish in this regard.

<p>
	What needs to be grokked is that consciousness cannot be explained. The problem here is way deeper than science can understand. No knowledge or explanation is ever Truth or Being.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to understand consciousness is to not-know it. But science is not in the business of not-knowing, it's in the business of knowing. So that cannot work.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness cannot be formalized because all formalization is finite while consciousness is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness has already been perfectly explained, so to speak, by mysticism. As soon as you understand consciousness you stop being a scientist and become a mystic by definition.
</p>

The Absolute cannot be known. Anything you know is not it. Being is not knowing, and knowing is not being.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to access Absolute Infinity sit down and stare at your hand. Your hand is it. Stare at it until it stops being your hand. Stop knowing your hand.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is identical to the actual present moment.

	All my pranayamas are the same. I visualize the prana flowing up the spine from chakra 1 to very tip top of the head, and then back down.

<p>
	Ideally you'd sit and concentrate. I'm often short on time so I just get on with life. To me, the value is in the physical rewiring effects of the pranayama. If I had more time I would concentrate more. Do nothing is also viable in my opinion.

<title>The dark side of meditation (having a proper theoretical foundation)</title>

</p>

<p>
	Think about what kind of practical skills would enable your LP. You could train to become a therapist for example, etc.
</p>

<p>
	There are many such opportunities.
</p>

<p>
	Since you live in the real world you're gonna have to build a set of stepping stones which move you up to your ultimate vision. Try to find a way to make a living that aligns with your LP at least somewhat. For example, becoming a therapist might be a great way to learn about helping people with their spiritual problems while also earning good money. Then you could transcend traditional therapy and do more spiritual type of retreats or workshops or coaching.
</p>

<p>
	Actualizing a big LP usually requires several such practical career moves. You can't just become exactly what you want in one step in most cases.
</p>

<p>
	Although if you were really serious, you could beocme a full-time monk and become enlightened within a few years.

<p>
	Definitely try plugging. It's a very different experience from smoking. Although you can't plug toad venom, you'll need synthetic.
</p>

<p>
	Blackout or whiteout is not good. The whole point of 5-MeO is that it's crystal clear and answers all questions. So far you haven't got it.
</p>

<p>
	Also try other psychedelics. LSD or mushrooms can easily give you nondual consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	With psychedelics it's very important that you don't overshoot with your dose. Less is better. At least for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics require at least 10-20 trips to start to get a handle on how they work. 1-5 trips is just not enough because there is too much variabilty between trips. Sometimes trips are duds or go sideways.

	Those who are doing the work aren't here yapping about it.
</p>

<p>
	What you need to realize is that the answers are all found inside you. When are you gonna get serious about self-observation and contemplation? When you do, you won't really need this place. It'll be only for amusement and maybe sharing a resource or two.

	Just look at the picture and find those spots on your body with your fingers at first, and then visualize them in your mind's eye and feel them through your body. There will be nothing there to feel per se. You're just going to imagine it for now. Ballpark it. Don't be a perfectionist.

	This is weak-sauce. Get to the fucking pranayamas and do at least 24 of them per day.

<p>
	My routine is the same as I last posted.
</p>

<p>
	I do 3 sets of Mahamudra, 3 sets of pranayama (36 total pranayama), and 3 breaths of fire. This takes me about 1h 20m
</p>

<p>
	Keep it this simple. Don't over-complicate things. Over time just increase the potency with which you feel and visualize the pranayamas. They are the key to this whole thing. So do them with real intent and feeling. Each breath upwards should feel like it's filling your skull with enlightenment. Suck that prana up your spine and into your skull like it's an actual fluid in your body.

<p>
	Be careful with how you throw around that word "depression". Clinically, it ain't depression until you've had it chronically for 6 months or more.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse an ego backlash or temporary shitty mood or some spiritual emotional upheaval with depression.
</p>

<p>
	There will be many times in your spiritual journey where you feel sad or dejected or lazy or agitated. These usually last for a few days, maybe a week, and then go away. That is all just trickery of the ego-mind. Totally normal.
</p>

<p>
	If it lasts for 3 months straight, okay, now maybe you should give it some serious consideration and stop meditation and seek some help.
</p>

<p>
	In my opinion you'd have a much higher likelihood of success with a year of Kriya yoga.
</p>

<p>
	But I haven't tried 1 year of SDS, so I can't say for sure.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know why you guys are not doing Kriya yoga. It's the most powerful natural technique I've found. All of you should be doing it religiously. Yet I sense that very few of you are.
</p>

<p>
	I've shared so many amazing tools with you guys. Why aren't you using them?

<p>
	That's good. But that's peanuts compared to what I'm talking about.
</p>

<p>
	Quantity of meditation alone is not enough. You must do more than meditate, you must deconstruct and become conscious of how ego runs your entire life from sunrise to sunset.
</p>

<p>
	You must infuse consciousness into your thinking process and your emoting.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you watch my The 10 Ox Herding Pictures video. It's very important for people like you.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, this is false. Look carefully at the present moment. It has no suffering in it.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is ALL mind. Stop fucking around, stop playing mind games, and observe how your mind is creating suffering. You ARE doing it! Notice this. Your mind is subtly interpreting and projecting negative meaning onto the present moment. You must look carefully to spot yourself doing this. From now on, every time you feel bad, you ask yourself "How am I creating this feeling? What must I believe to feel this way? What must I think to feel this way?"
</p>

<p>
	I can tell you exactly what happened to you. You got lucky and caught a solid glimpse of the Ox because my video blindsided your ego. It hit you out of blue, thus bypassing many egoic defense mechanisms. But your mind did not have a solid enough foundation to permanently hold this insight. The ego figured out a way to reassert itself and now it has doubled its defense mechanisms. It will not allow another easy, lucky break. Now you're gonna have to work for it.
</p>

<p>
	My guess is you are depressed because you want that enlightenment back and yet you don't know how go get it back. You thought catching a glimpse of the Ox was gonna solve all your problems and make life peachy without any serious spiritual work. And now you are starting to see that was just a fantasy. This is why you're depressed.
</p>

<p>
	But the truth is, you just got lucky. It was never really gonna hold because you have not done almost any work decontructing that big fat ego. You cannot be enlightened and maintain all of your habitual daily egoic manipulations, beliefs, attitudes, etc. All of that needs to be broken down piece by piece. You need to undo yourself and your life. The way you carry yourself every minute of every day IS ego! All of your emtional reactions and thought patterns must be purified through patient observation and contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of enlightenment as a magic pill. You must also become deeply conscious of your daily actions, thoughts, and emotions. Enlightnement is only likely to stick if your entire mind is deconstructed. So cheer up and begin that procees.
</p>

<p>
	Cheer up because you were even so lucky as to get a 10 day glimpse. That takes most people YEARS of work. You got it for free.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, finding God and then losing God is very frustrating. But also totally normal and common in this work. Awaking up is not like flipping a light switch, it's more like a kid playing with a light switch, flickering it on and off many many times.
</p>

<title>The End of the Game: Deconstructing the Portals to the Absolute</title>

<p>
	What people fail to get is that consciousness isn't a thing, it is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	If you think of consciousness as a thing, as a substance, as experiential phenomena, as form, or as a state, then it will seem that there is something prior to consciousness. But really there is not. If you hold that there is 1) consciousness, and 2) something prior to it, that's two things! Which is duality.
</p>

<p>
	Regardless of which labels you wish to use, in the end your ultimate understanding of reality better contain only 1 thing! Otherwise it's still a subtle duality.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing is to realize ONENESS, and why it cannot be anything but ONE.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you choose to call that ONE is then a matter of style.
</p>

<p>
	"Consciousness" and "awareness" are very tricky words. Be careful what you assume about these words. Consciousness and awareness are not what you assume they are. You will only appreciate that at the moment of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help suss out what consciousness really is and how it behaves.
</p>

<p>
	You would want to use a salt form, not freebase. Most N,N-DMT is freebase. But I have seen salt versions of it.
</p>

<p>
	If your N,N-DMT is unspecified, it's freebase. You have to go out of your way to find salt.
</p>

<p>
	The dose would also be significantly larger than 5-MeO-DMT. It will defintely be less comfortable sticking 100mg+ of chemical in your ass.

And don't forget the most important thing you know and love: yourself!
</p>

<p>
	Nothing you know about yourself is real. It's all a costume. Even the idea that you were born, is a story. You were never physically born. You arose as the story of you. One day the thought appeared: "I was born" and because this thought was never questioned, it became the basis of your entire reality. Then to that core fiction you slowly added all the rest of that you think of as yourself and your persona. In childhood, in school you built up the story of yourself and the world.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, fear, vulnerability, hurt, sadness... all of those are tools of the ego-mind to prevent self-reflection. It's okay to feel whatever feelings arise. But do notice, they are yet more manipulations. Manipulations on top of manipulations.
</p>

<p>
	Consider, if all your manipulations stopped, you would cease to exist. Which would be enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	All this is a lot to stomach. Stay with it. It will be worth it in the end.
</p>

<p>
	I have said exactly the same thing in my Becoming A Zen Devil video and The 10 Ox Herding Pictures video.
</p>

<p>
	Most people half-ass spirituality due to piss-poor theoretical foundation. This is common with shallow Neo-Advaita style teachings.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to theory, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. But I would rather have too much than too little.
</p>

<p>
	Technically, a Zen Devil is one who practices Zen with no theory.

<p>
	To be clear, this is nothing against you, or particular to you. This is the entire dynamic of life: using stories, concepts, and emotions to manipulate yourself into staying alive. This is what survival is all about. So whether you have dreams or don't, you're doing it. Whether your thoughts and emotions are positive or negative, you're doing it. Even when you feel happy or excited, it's a subtle egoic manipulation. The ego has co-opted the entire experience of life and turned it into a means towards self-perpetuation.
</p>

<p>
	Unraveling the inner workings of the ego-mind is a complex and tricky affair. A good place to start is to notice how every thought, every emotion, and every reaction you have, all day long, is somehow a subtle manipulation of yourself to act the way the devilish ego-mind wants. It takes a lot of patient observation of your thoughts, emotions, and reactions to start to see the full scope of what ego is doing. So start observing.
</p>

<p>
	You can contemplate questions like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Why do I have emotions at all? What is the point of them?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do I have thoughts at all? What is their purpose?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do I hold somethings as positive and others as negative? What is the point of positive and negative?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why am I motivated to do the things I do? What is the point of motivation and why does it exist?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do I hold some things as meaningful while others not? What is the point of meaning? Why do I create it?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Of course the ego-mind will vehemently resist and deflect all such questioning. Your survival agenda does not want to be questioned.
</p>

<p>
	Start looking at EVERYTHING that transpires in your experience of life as a deliberate egoic self-manipulation. Everything in your experience at all times is the ego trying to survive. This survival is not merely about physical life and death, it's extremely sophisticated. What's being survived in not a physical being, but a conceptual construct: the story of YOU.
</p>

<p>
	You -- the ego -- is like a giant living story which is writing itself every minute of its life. Any interference with this writing is perceived as threatening and therefore demonized and rejected.
</p>

Assume for a moment that you can be equally wealthy and successful no matter which career on Earth you pick. Which would you pick?
</p>

<p>
	Do that!
</p>

<p>
	In order to determine this, you really have to be able to step outside your cultural programming and various pragmatic fears that will arise. The fear is clouding your judgment, drowning out your heart's inner guidance.
</p>

<p>
	The heart knows what it wants, but the ego is too scared to listen. The counter-intuitive move here is to listen to your heart despite the fear, trusting that there is a higher intelligence at work.
</p>

<p>
	The more seriously you listen to your fears vs your heart, the more miserable, depressed, and regretful you will be in life, no matter how much money or success you achieve. It could even end up destroying your mental and physical health in the long-run. So don't take this lightly.
</p>

<p>
	Dare to live life offensively rather than defensively. Especially if you're young.

<p>
	That's usually how it goes.
</p>

<p>
	That's a glimpse of the Ox's tail. An important milestone but far from the end.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind is not prepared to handle the magnitude of what it discovers. That takes much more work. The ego-mind has to be slowly deconstructed piece by piece so that it's capable of staying in the light of nondual consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot stabilize in nondual consciousness and maintain all of your old devilish egoic modes of thinking, reacting, judging, interpreting, etc. It really helps to pull out a journal and start deconstructing your deepest beliefs about life, yourself, and reality.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Infinity and the present moment are real we might say, since they are Absolutes.
</p>

<p>
	But you are not conscious of Infinity nor even the present moment right now. So as far as you're concerned, nothing you know is real. Accessing the real takes a lot of mindfulness practice. Right now you are lost in the conceptual fantasies and projections of your own mind.
</p>

<p>
	Try becoming conscious of what the present moment is, minus all of your mental projections, meanings, beliefs, assumptions, interpretations, stories, judgments, emotions, etc. Try to "feel" what that is. Try to notice that NOW is an Absolute. It is not inside of time (time is a concept). NOW is prior to time. Time occurs inside of NOW. But what is NOW? Take a close long look. After all, it's always NOW!
</p>

<p>
	And Infinity is precisely identical to what is happening right NOW.
</p>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14400-orpheusnovum/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14400" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14400-orpheusnovum/" rel="">@OrpheusNovum</a> You are REALLY lost in concepts.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you said above is a conceptual fantasy that your mind constructed. Time, space, physics, objectivity, depression, body, mind, inner, outer, other people, nihilism, solipsism, Aristotle, Nietzsche, ancient Greece -- are all mental fabrications.
</p>

<p>
	If you think Actualized.org is "nihilistic" or "solipsistic" you are really not understanding nonduality, spirituality, or consciousness yet.
</p>

<p>
	Neither focusing on the mind or the body is the real solution. What is necessary is to self-reflect and become more conscious. Consciousness is neither inner nor outer, neither mind or body. What you call "the body" is really just another aspect of your mind. And the entire domain of mind is unreal anyways.
</p>

<p>
	More practically-speaking, if you're new to this work (and it's obvious you are given what you wrote), nothing I say is against the body per se. If you are stuck in depression and you want to use a body-based approach for breaking out, like Hatha yoga, gym, cleaning up your diet, going out to nightclubs with your friends, starting a business, going mountain-climbing, etc. -- that can be a useful approach. But in the end it will not be a root solution to depression because depression is deeply rooted in your metaphysical disconnection from consciousness & being. No amount of body work will solve that. No amount of success will solve that. For that, you must deeply investigate the inner workings of your own mind and your entire identity.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest work you can do it is done in solitude sitting on a cushion. But this is advanced work. Most people are not yet ready to do that. They need a lot of external actions first. And that's okay. I have nothing against taking external action. I spent many years taking external actions. But nowadays I'm at the point in my own development where I mostly care about internal actions. Pretty much all of your external actions are driven by ego, and this is the root problem. You are not going to solve that problem through more external action. But this is not to say external actions are somehow bad. In practice most people need to take a lot of external action when getting started with personal development.
</p>

<p>
	Not only is objectivity not necessary, it is impossible! There is no such thing! You made it up.
</p>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/8864-hero-of-time/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="8864" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/8864-hero-of-time/" rel="">@Hero of Time</a> Well, firstly you should know that the stuff you were doing at Blue which you call "spirituality" was mostly fantasy, group-think, & egotism, not genuine spirituality. So very little is actually lost by letting all that go aside from your ego taking a beating (which is precisely spiritual!).
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, don't wait to reach some Spiral stage to do genuine spirituality. You can begin it at any time (if you dare).
</p>

<p>
	For example, you could go take a psychedelic tomorrow and experience God in 30 minutes. No need to wait. And that's just one simple example.
</p>

<p>
	And finally, for me stage Orange "spirituality" felt a bit like recognizing the wonders of the universe through science and rationality. This is pretty weak when compared to genuine spirituality, but it can be exciting. Most great scientists become scientists because science is their way of doing spirituality (connecting with the wonder of nature & existence). They just aren't conscious of this yet. If you look at someone like Neil DeGrasse Tyson that's what he's doing every time he speaks publicly: he's scratching his own spiritual itch, via science.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is really nothing other than the exploration of yourself, the exploration of the universe, the taking in of nature in a conscious & truthful way. You are God exploring itself. The big problem with stage Blue is that it prevented you from ACTUALLY exploring yourself. Now you are free to go explore and see what can be discovered.
</p>

<p>
	Don't use Spiral Dynamics to limit yourself. You can go straight for Turquoise teachings right now! You might not be able to stomach or understand them, but you also might! So it's worth a shot. You could start doing Kriya yoga tomorrow and see huge shifts in consciousness within 3-6 months. It's not guaranteed, but you won't know till you try.
</p>

<p>
	No, my only regret is that I didn't awaken sooner and that I am still not fully awake.

<p>
	That is possible, but you will remain clueless about the domain of psychedelics and what they can or cannot do for you.
</p>

<p>
	The core problem here is that you are judging a thing (assuming what it can or cannot do for you) without any direct emprical evidence.
</p>

<p>
	It's a kin to a white person saying: "I don't want to talk to black people because they have nothing to offer me." Well, you don't know that until you actually talk to some. You might be pleasantly surprised.

<p>
	That would be 0.0000000000001% of what your happiness would be at the moment of full awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Try to imagine how happy you would feel if realized that death is impossible and that you are immortal and nothing in the universe can ever hurt you and that you personally own every galaxy and all of the stuff in them. And this condition lasts forever.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If you want true happiness, stop thinking with your dick.

<p>

<p>
	That would be fear.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can certainly have that fear. But truth doesn't care about your fears.
</p>

<p>
	There maybe lots of legitimate fears about flying to the moon. But if you have not flown to the moon, you get no say about what is on the moon. You chose to not experience the moon.
</p>

<p>
	And of course all fear stems directly from ego. So you fell into the trap of letting the devil dictate your inquiry into truth. And so the very thing you feared: delusion, you have made real.

<p>
	The basis of all genuine understanding is direct personal experience and investigation. Until you perosnally gain significant experience with psychedelics, you will not understand what the words "psychedelic", or "experience", or "reality" even mean.
</p>

<p>
	1 or 2 trips is also not enough to understand. This will require some serious investigation from you.
</p>

<p>
	Until such time, you can even begin to imagine how little you understand.
</p>

<p>
	If you are too lazy or scared to investigate this domain of life, that's on you. Then you have chosen personal comfort over truth.
</p>

<p>
	Since you do not know what truth is, you also do not know where truth could be found.
</p>

			How is one able to function in day to day life with that paradigm in the forefront? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The realization of nonduality is an extremely radical shift. Really, your old life is gone. You are dead at this point, so the question of "function" (survival) is moot. There is nothing left to survive. The game of life is over. You have awoken from survival.
</p>

<p>
	Consider, the only reason you worry about survival issues is because you hold the belief that you are alive. What would happen if that belief was surrendered? What would happen if you surrendered all control over your life such that there was zero effort or struggle? What would happen if you became God? Would worry about anything?
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is not a paradigm. It is Absolute.
</p>

I would guess that 90% of people who watch Actualized.org take zero action so they get very little results. It's like watching videos about weightlifting and expecting to get jacked without ever stepping foot in the gym.
</p>

<p>
	This work requires serious intention, motivation, passion, and persistence. By definition, 99% of people will be too lazy and myopic to do it. We are talking about the most advanced wisdom available to mankind. This will not be actualized effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want, you can totally transform your life. The choice is yours. How serious are you gonna take it?
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't take 3 years to see results.
</p>

<p>
	If you were serious, in 3 years you could earn hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash or transcend death using the information I've talked about.
</p>

<p>
	The problem isn't that what I say it too good to be true, it's that it's so true you'll hardly believe it when you see it.
