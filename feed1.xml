			Except pulling Prana up and down the spine is not Kriya... You can do this practice, yes. But it is not the Kriya taught by Lahiri Mahasaya. And no, the techniques are not "simple". If they were, then there wouldn't be all the confusion, lack of progress, and negative side effects that are so common on this forum. Talking down to people and trying to invalidate their concerns, questions, and issues does not fix anything, and is actually quite harmful, imo.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It is the Kriya Yoganada taught and which works for many people. You are mudding the waters.
</p>

<p>
	There are hundreds of different yogic systems. So to claim one true one is silly. Pick a system and go with it, rather than debating about which is the true one. There is no true one. They are all imaginary inventions of the mind, with various pros and cons. You can invent your own yoga if you want, just as all yogas have been invented by someone before you.

You're just speaking from the perspective of the Absolute while I was speaking from the relative.
</p>

<p>
	The relative perspective is important functionally, from the POV of survival. A society cannot be built if you regard outcomes like Stalin as of equal value as that of the Buddha. Even though of course in the absolute sense they are of equal value.
</p>

<p>
	I have discussed all of this before. You're conflating relative and absolute domains.
</p>

<p>
	There is no need to convince me of your paradigm. All paradigms and formulations of the Absolute are partial and relative. If you like your paradigm, fine. But convincing me of it a waste of time.

<p>
	You are free to start a commune in any 1st world country.

<p>
	But it will fail. As all communes become as corrupt as the people running them.
</p>

<p>
	The corruption is not out there, it is inside you. So no matter how much you fight evil on the outside, you will never conquer it because your inside creates it.

<p>
	But young people hardly vote, so they matter less.
</p>

<p>
	The most famous people are some of the dumbest members of our species. Of course there a few exceptions. But the most wise are almost never popular or even known about.
</p>

<p>
	The wisest person in the world will never be as popular as Trump or Kim Kardashian. Because popularity requires appealing to a herd of idiots. It's much easier to impress 10 million idiots than 10 million serious intellectuals.

	True freedom is the last thing the ego-mind wants.
</p>

<p>
	Freedom = death
</p>

<p>
	So just keep that in mind when you ask for maximimum freedom. You just might get it.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is all about limitation.

<p>
	I don't know about that. Might just be coincidence.

<p>
	It's even more powerful if you inject it stright in your veins. So I wouldn't place too much importance in that.

<p>
	Yes, of course. Even Trump and Stalin are very intelligent things. Their ego just gets in the way of access to God's infinite intelligence. But never totally. Even the most evil humans still use God's intelligence to do their evil. In fact, evil is highly intelligent. But nowhere near as intelligent as Goodness and Love.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That can be tricky. Depends on what exactly you mean.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to ground the ego or its sense of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is like jumping out of an airplane with no parachute only to realize that there is no ground. Then your life is a constant free fall for eternity.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind will do everything possible to stay grounded in the false ground of "reality". To seriously awaken this ground must be completely unraveled. You must realize that reality has no ground. Of course that ultimately will leave you right in the NOW. But first the entire ego-mind and sense of reality must collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire sense of what reality is must be unraveled and deconstructed.
</p>

	Way too much confusion in this thread. Just do the practices. They are so simple.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're being asked to read a book on how to tie your shoelaces and then spend 90% of your time debating and doubting the simple instructions.
</p>

<p>
	Pull prana up the spine, then down. Do this over and over again. The end. The rest is minutia.

<p>
	It's just intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Intelligence must be contextual, otherwise it's not very intelligent.
</p>

<p>
	Intelligence is a universal property of consciousness which can range from 0 to infinity and everything in between. Infinite Intelligence is the universe's total and complete self-understanding. Which is a real thing.

	There isn't a safe way. Safety is a concern of the ego-mind. You must surrender to the possibility of the worst happening.

			<strong>Darkness</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			I was lying on a couch looking at the ceiling. Suddenly the ceiling turned into a dark moving substance, that seemed to move towards me. This is where the trip gets a bit creepy. I saw that a black tube is attached to my body going up to the dark substance. My first ‘thought’ was, that this is some kind of a spirit attack, because it felt like the dark substance is sucking energy out of my body. My second ‘thought’ was, that this dark spirit/being is stealing my energy and causing my disease. Strangely I felt rather strong in that situation and commanded the darkness to leave. A second later I was amazed that the dark substance actually withdrew.
		</p>

		<p>
			A few moments after the withdrawal I had the epiphany, that what I saw and felt wasn’t some kind of an attack, but rather a prenatal memory: me in the womb of my mother. However as far as I can remember I had also some ‘insights’ about my ancestors being haunted by dark spirits. Unfortunately I can’t remember a lot I experienced in this part of the trip – or maybe I just repressed it.
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Your entire life and reality is imaginary and how you understand any part of life is itself an act of imagination which uses symbols and metaphors and other such functions of consciousness. So when such things happen during trips what you should notice is that these are just various ways that consciousness is imagining and communicating with itself.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you could picture that you have a disease by imagining that there is a problem with your DNA. Or you could picture that you have a disease because there is an evil spirit lurking in your body. Neither one is more "real" than the other because everything is imaginary. It doesn't really matter whether you imagine DNA or evil spirits. It's all imaginary!
</p>

<p>
	If you say, "But Leo, DNA is scientific and not as imaginary as evil spirits." You're wrong. Science is as imaginary as evil spirits. The only difference is that you imagine science is "real" and you imagine that evil spirits are somehow unreal. So there's multiple layers of imagination at work which create the illusion of reality.
</p>

<p>
	What you need to realize is that all ways of holding reality are totally relative. There is no one true right way to hold reality. All communication is relative. How you communicate with yourself depends on which symbolic paradigm you want to use: scientific, religious, mathematical, etc. It doesn't really matter what the paradigm is as long as it's internally consistent.
</p>

	Hehe.... Well, you're in luck. Because self-government is exactly what all government is.

	When a corporate band comes to take your house with tanks, helicopters, and mercenaries, you'll quickly yell for controlling them to not being able to do that. And thus government is born.

Don't necessarily draw a connection between the two. The Dems had historic wins in 2018. A Blue Wave did happen. So it could happen again.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is a buffoon of epic proportions, so this is a unique situtation in the US which should be looked at as a special case. No past performance will be indicative of what happens in 2020. We're in a whole new ballpark now. Things are very fluid.
</p>

<p>
	I think even Biden can beat Trump. Of course Biden would be a pretty depressing result. But what can you do? The country can only grow as fast as its citizens are wise. Progress is a long-term game. Bernie has already shifted the whole Dem policy platform to the left even if he loses. So overall, even with Trump in power, we are still making progress.

<p>
	This is to be expected.
</p>

<p>
	Older generations always have less progressive values. Progress is always made by the older generation dying off, not evolving. It's easier for most people to die off than evolve up two Spiral stages.
</p>

<p>
	Newer generations are always more progressive. Because it's easier to simply be born later than to grow out of your old ways.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why people under 35 overwhemlingly support Bernie while Biden's supporters are mostly over 50.

<p>
	We always have to remind ourselves, Bernie is a long-shot candidate. It assumes great wisdom on the part of the citizenry to elect Bernie. This wisdom is often lacking. Most of the citizenry is not that wise or visionary. They often would rather vote for the status quo rather than take a risk on a bold vision.
</p>

<p>
	It's not merely corporate Dems which hold Bernie back with their smears. It's that many Dems are simply not conscious enough to understand Bernie's vision. Most voters are NOT progressives. So electing a true progressive is always a difficult long-shot. It's likely that Bernie will not win the Dem nomination. But even so, it's worth a shot.

<title>What spiritual teachers say &quot;You are God&quot; ?</title>

<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	What some of you guys aren't fathoming yet is that awakening is God-realization. Nothing else. You still hold God as one thing and awakening as something else.
</p>

<p>
	When people speak of awakening or enlightenment what they really mean is:
</p>

<p>
	1) Realizing you are God.
</p>

<p>
	And...
</p>

<p>
	2) Realizing what God is.
</p>

<p>
	Of course some people haven't awoken deeply enough to understand this. There is much depth to understanding what God is.
</p>

<p>
	Do not be so naive and literal that you need a teacher to tell you the words, "You are God." They rarely state it so bluntly. Often because they know the ego will reject such a direct statement or misunderstand it.
</p>

<p>
	Be very careful with being overly literal in your reading of mystical teachings. It is a serious mistake to search the Bible for the phrase "You are God", and failing to find it, conclude that the Bible doesn't teach that you are God. Mystical teachings are not written for literal-minded rational buffoons. They are written for highly intuitive intellects which know how to connect dots.
</p>

<p>
	Intelligence and wisdom is being able to read between the lines. To understand what which cannot be made explicit.
</p>

	Yup, this is common. Enlightenment can lead to periods of loss of meaning and motivation. This is usually a phase. Many things might get dropped during this phase and facing the fear of dropping major parts of your life is part of the challenge of this work. It can be hard to navigate this.

	They are gross, but what can you do? People are herd animals. The status quo will always have its defenders. That's survival 101. They don't know better and it's not in their survival interest to know better.

<p>
	That is not Ralston's state. He's playful and heart-felt at times. He understands the beauty of the universe. He just isn't explicit about it. It's just that classic Zen style.
</p>

<p>
	Even the harshest Zen masters are still filled with love.

Have you talked with him about that? I get the impression he didn't suffer much at all. He seems like one of those guys that live isolated getting completely obsessed with like studying a molecule for 20 years straight. It's just that his obsession happened to be consciousness.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	He is definitely hyper obsessive and focused. That's the key to his mastery, I think.
</p>

<p>
	He is self-described autistic. So that shapes how he approaches awakening. He has a dry and cold approach. This has its pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know how much he suffered. In one of his old martial books he writes about getting depressed and going through a Dark Night after some of his deeper awakenings. So I wouldn't assume he didn't suffer. He just doesn't share that stuff much.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston is an oddball. He is not a good representation of how awakening works for normal people. He ain't normal by his disposition. So be careful emulating him unless your personality type is like his.

<p>
	You got it backwards. From God's POV there is no time and no linear sequence of cause and effect. From the human POV things unfold in a linear sequence.
</p>

<p>
	Cause and effect happens in infinite directions from God's POV. This is a huge mindfuck for a human mind.

<p>
	Because when I explicitly asked him about love, he brushed it off as merely an emotion. This clearly shows that something is missing. It's not merely a matter of defintions and words. He is missing that facet of awakening, which is why he doesn't teach it.
</p>

<p>
	Worry about your own bias.

<p>
	Lust for other women is common for men. It's just how we tend to be wired. But this idea that you should deliberately sleep around is stupid if you are already in a happy relationship.
</p>

<p>
	I would say, if you like this girl, commit to being with her. And if it doesn't work out and you become single, then you can sleep around at that time.
</p>

<p>
	There are times to sleep around, but when you're in a loving relationship already isn't one of those times.
</p>

<p>
	Be mindful that you sleeping around would cause her lots of suffering and it would certianly destroy your relationship. She will never forgive you for sleeping around. Nor should she, because you're acting like an ass, throwing away a good thing by thinking with your dick.

<p>
	Of course I can't crawl inside his head and know with 100% accuracy how he uses the word love.
</p>

<p>
	But Love is not a trap. To reduce it to that is a grave error.
</p>

<p>
	People can fall victim to all sorts of traps in this work. There are many "truth traps", but that doesn't keep him from using the word Truth in reference to the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone doing this work starts with their own flawed ideas about what Truth, Love, God, Self, and Consciousness are. That's all par for the course. That doesn't mean we stop using those words. We need some words to speak of such facets. Those words are as good as we'll get. The error is not in the words but in the ego-minds who can't help but misunderstand them.

	Love = Truth = Being = Consciousness
</p>

<p>
	There is only one substance of which the entire universe is made. That stuff is Love.
</p>

<p>
	It is problematic that Ralston's work (his books) do not use the word "Love" basically at all. From my POV, that's a very serious omission. That would be like writing a cookbook that never mentions the word "salt".

</p>

<p>
	If there wasn't a strong government (as the Libertarians want), rape and enslavement would be very real possibilities in your life. This is the key insight that Libertarians are missing.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarians basically want a boxing match without a referee on the grounds that a referee unfairly restricts their freedom. Well, that boxing match will very quickly devolve into an execution. Freedom means that your opponent can rape your corpse after he's done killing you.

	Love is of course a human emotion, but it's also an Absolute. Which is a facet of awakening that he's missing.

<p>
	My political predictions are not infallible and they do not hinge on the Absolute. They are relativistic predictions.
</p>

<p>
	It would be idiotic to claim that I know with 100% certainty what will happen in 2020 because I had some awakenings. And of course I never made such claims.

Ego wants positivity and pleasure and good mood. All of that is conditional and fleeting and leads to suffering and self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot become happy by chasing positive mood. Chasing positive mood leads to suffering.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is this: if you want to be happy, you have to stop caring whether you are happy or not.

<p>
	There's no mystery here.
</p>

<p>
	You can have total understanding of life's greatest metaphysical questions but not necessarily have it reflected in your outward behavior. What he means when he says, "I have all the answers" is existential answers, not survival answers. Existential answers do not requires any outward behaviors. You can have many existential answers but still be an asshole.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is conflating awakening itself with transformation of the mind, body, and human self. Having awakenings is relatively easy while changing the structures and habits of the mind is much harder and takes a long time of sustained practice.
</p>

<p>
	Also, nothing about awakening requires the guy to stay with his wife and family, or conform to any other kind of social expectations. They are projecting those expectations onto him. The expectations of how an enlightened person ought to behave. Nothing says that an enlightened person ought to act nice towards you.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is conflating issues of Absolute Truth with survival. Just because you are conscious of Absolute Truth does not mean you'll be good at managing money or family. Nor does it even mean you will feel positive. These are all separate issues.
</p>

<p>
	One of things awakening tends to do is make one uninterested in mundane survival issues. As they are seen to be trivial.
</p>

	Just to clarify, this also might change. There are phases in life when I am more isolated, and other phases when I am more social.
</p>

<p>
	And solitude does not literally require a cabin in the woods. Solitude can be had in the middle of a busy city.

<p>
	Don't be so defeatist. Dems have a decent chance of winning back the Senate in 2020. Most voters are not blind Trumpists. Many voters will be upset at Republican Senators in swing states next year. Could be enough to flip the Senate. Another blue wave is likely. Impeachment rallies the progressive base.

<p>
	Your analysis lacks nuance. Both parties are not at all the same and are not equally corrupt.
</p>

<p>
	Also, most politicians care about a lot more than getting reelected. They work hard to create the best government they know how to create.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to make simplistic and naive critiques without having lifted a finger to actually create a good government.
</p>

<p>
	You may have escaped the trap of being a Republican, but you've now fallen into another. It takes a lot of careful study and contemplation to start to understand how government and politics work. Careful acting like a know-it-all in this domain. You have years of learning ahead of you.
</p>

<p>
	There is a lot more to creating good government than picking one of two sides, or picking no side.
</p>

	"Experience" is already a dualistic, biased notion. Strictly speaking experience does not occur because there is no experiencer.
</p>

<p>
	There is no reality or world outside of one's imagination. You imagined your birth and you imagine your death.

<title>Why this Trump impeachment is a waste of time for progressives</title>

<p>
	Causing people suffering is not sufficent grounds for impeachment.
</p>

<p>
	It does not matter that the Senate will not remove him. Their votes are good enough to publically shame them.
</p>

<p>
	Successful impeachment does not require removal. Tarnishing the entire right-wing brand is good enough. Senators may lose their seats by voting in Trump's favor. The more Republicans debase themselves to defend Trump the better for future progress. They are making fools of themselves.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The Ukraine scandal is clear cut, unlike those other cases. When you try a criminal you need an airtight case.
</p>

<p>
	It is okay to get Al Capone on tax evasion when you don't have a smoking gun for murder.
</p>

<p>
	Law enforcement is a pragmatic thing. Dems have to be careful not to overreach. Ukriane is crystal clear to anyone with a bit of intellectual integrity. So it's a great thing to impeach him on.

<p>
	It doesn't matter what the polls say, impeachment is about enforcement of law. If Trump was not impeached he would have total immunity, which is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	All anti-impeachment arguments on political grounds are non-sense. The politics are irrelevant. Clear criminal behavior must be enforced, not when politically convenient or if it moves polls, but always.
</p>

<p>
	Law and order.
</p>

<p>
	Moving polls is not what impeachment is about.
</p>

<p>
	A wave function is itself a thought. Thought cannot describe thought.
</p>

<p>
	Symbolic understanding can only go so far because it is always 2nd order phenomenon. All language and explanation is dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	Symbolic understanding can never explain itself and it is always incomplete, a la Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.
</p>

<p>
	The only complete thing is Absolute Infinity, which is reality itself, not a map of it.

</p>

<p>
	The key mistake you're making is assuming that by cranking up suffering you can make a thing more real or true. But all this does is make the illusion stronger. No matter how much pain or suffering you are stir up, it does not make it real.
</p>

<p>
	By your silly logic, you could show clips of the bloodiest horror movies to argue that movies are real. But just because a movie shows horror doesn't make it any more real.
</p>

<p>
	Your selfishness is getting in the way of seeing Infinite Love. Yes, those clips you linked are absolutely Infinite Love. Your ego is just making you judge them because you lack consciousness, because you have not done any serious spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different ways it can feel:
</p>

<p>
	Like nothing, like becoming the entire universe, like love, like death, like God, awe, horror, like waking up from a dream, like heaven, etc.

<p>
	Tease her and flirt with her. Be playful in your conversations. Share some stories about yourself with her so she gets a feel for who you are.
</p>

<p>
	THEN you can ask for her number. Don't mention the word "date". You can tell her, "Let's grab a coffee sometime" as you get her number.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	#1 rule with girls: never explicitly tell them about sex. If she's gonna fuck you, she needs to be able to maintain the appearance of being a lady. When you tell her explicitly about sex, you make her feel like a cheap whore, and she will never sleep with you after that.
</p>

<p>
	You must play subtle and coy.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of "You down to fuck?" make it, "Let's get a coffee." Make things sound as innocent as possible. Rather than telling her, "Let's go have sex" tell her, "Let's go watch cartoons".
</p>

<p>
	There is no problem if you wanna fuck. Just don't go telling girls about it. Dating is a game. You gotta flirt and tease your way into her pants.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive. One of the best things you can do is act like you are totally disinterested in sex. You can even tell her, "We are definitely not having sex tonight." Then have sex with her 10 minutes later.
</p>

<p>
	Get good at playing these mind games.
</p>

She doesn't even know you exist. Move on.
</p>

<p>
	A girl who is attracted to you will respond to texts within minutes or hours at most.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot attract girls via text. If she's not responsive it's because you failed to build attraction in person and nothing can be done to overcome that.
</p>

<p>
	You must reach hook-point in person in order to get responsive texts. Try harder to reach hook-point. It's very noticable when you do. Usually happens within 5-10 mins. You will feel her get enthusiastic about you. She will look in your eyes and be very interested in what you have to say. She will be eager to follow your lead.
</p>

<p>
	Do not spend any time thinking about girls who haven't hooked. It will only bring you misery.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I have worldly obligations. Mostly with my biz (Actualized.org) and you guys. Also a bit of family obligations, but not much.
</p>

<p>
	I am not a social person because I find it too shallow and I like my freedom.
</p>

<p>
	I don't need to talk much about these topics with people/family because I get it out via my videos. The videos are my outlet.
</p>

<p>
	To me social balance looks like living in a cabin in the woods with maybe a girlfriend. And interacting with students via teachings or writing. I don't care for having a social life in the conventional sense.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to emulate this unless it feels natural to you. People have different social preferences. Mystics tend to have an abnormally high tolerance for solitude.
</p>

<p>
	Figure out what you want. What I want is irrelevant to you.

<p>
	Of course selfish vs selfless is a duality. Ying and yang feeding each other.
</p>

<p>
	Good with a captial G is absolutely everything. If you have to self-actualize to be Good, your notion of Good is far too weak and conditional.
</p>

<p>
	You are Good even if you rape dogs.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness is none other than Love made manifest.

	No only are days, weeks, months, and years relative, time itself is an invented notion. At one point in your life you had to invent the notion of "time". Before that, time did not exist for you.
</p>

<p>
	Of course as Einstein's relativity shows, even at the physical level, there is no such thing as time. In fact, physics cannot define what time is other than in terms of velocity, which is a circular definition (as all physics definitions are).
</p>

<p>
	Which is why time seems to fly when you're not thinking about it, and seems to crawl when you're wishing it would go faster. You are imagining time.
</p>

There's no appreciation of the complexity of human societies, cities, nations, businesses, courts, international trade, warfare, diplomacy, culture, education system, etc. There is no systems thinking. In the libertarian mind everyone is just an individual actor doing whatever he wants as long as it doesn't hurt others.

<p>
	Stop thinking about survival.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is transcendence of the domain of survival, wherein all problems and suffering lie.
</p>

<p>
	Your life sucks to the extent that it is about survival. No lasting happiness can be found in survival. Survival is constant suffering and dissatisfaction.

<p>
	Because to be a libertarian requires an enormously previleged life. You have to be so disconnected from the realities of survival that you are clueless about things like racism, rape, abuse, exploitation, slavery, corruption, war, warlords, tribal warfare, gangs, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It sure helps to be a young white male who grew up in the suburbs of America where no one had much of a chance to exploit you.

<p>
	Of course! That's selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	You can't be selfish without being outraged by unfair treatment of your self.
</p>

<p>
	Cooperation is also done out of selfishness.

	The only thing unstraight about your life is that you think you are real or important.

</p>

<p>
	Ultimate reality cannot be framed in terms of any dualistic statement.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot say, "Reality is like X and not Y." Because reality includes X and Y and transcends both. Both X and Y are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Grasp this, so you stop asking endless silly questions.

<title>Hard time dealing with some kind of awakening</title>

<p>
	You're in a place of confusion because you've only licked the surface of what awakening is. A lot more trips and a lot more contemplation is required to make sense of your trips and come to peace with them.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with how the ego-mind tries to interpret awakening experiences.
</p>

<p>
	If you watch my video: The Many Facets Of Awakening, it can help you make sense of your experiences.
