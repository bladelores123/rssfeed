<title>Do you need a goal in fitness?</title>

<p>
	Don't take bodybuilders too seriously. They tend to be an overly vain bunch with their materialistic goals.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, you will hit a point where you just want to maintain your health. You can't be hitting bodybuilding goals forever.
</p>

<p>
	At some point your goal should be to just have an enjoyable healthy workout.
</p>

<p>
	There's really nowhere to go once you drop all those vain bodybuilding goals.
</p>

<p>
	Goals can be great at the beginning though, if you need to lose some weight or just getting into the hobby. Of course you can have goals to build up certain muscle groups or whatever. But you can't keep raising your goals forever. Nor is that even desirable.
</p>

<p>
	After 10-15 years of non-stop gym work, I gave up on the whole notion of fitness goals. It's a waste of energy which you should be channeling into your spiritual work. Moderate exercise is all that anyone needs once they are at a healthy weight and eating properly.
</p>

<p>
	You might even want to replace gym with hatha yoga at some point.
</p>

	Russian interference is obvious. The only question is to what extent, and collusion is still a iffy, but certainly within the realm of possibility. If Trump had the chance he'd certainly do it. His only defense might be that he was too incompetent to coordinate something like that.

<p>
	I think it's good stuff if you can afford it. It might really help with certain issues. Not all issues, but some.
</p>

<p>
	You can find great local reiki healers simply via Yelp. And there are other kinds of healers besides reiki on there which might be even more useful, again, depends on the issue.
</p>

<p>
	It's definitely genuine. Whether it's worth the cost depends on what your goals are and your salary.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a decent salary it's a good investment.

<p>
	You're thinking about this is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Your fibromyalgia is likely the result of you living your life in unspiritual ways.
</p>

<p>
	The fibromyalgia isn't holding you back from spirituality, it is PUSHING you to wake up!
</p>

<p>
	Your body is screaming at you: WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WE CAN'T KEEP LIVING LIKE THIS! CONNECT ME TO SOURCE!!!!
</p>

<p>
	This is a much more robust issue than merely meditation. Your entire life needs to be spiritualized and infused with mindfulness and consciousness and love.

<p>
	No, we will not take that for granted.
</p>

<p>
	You don't take for granted that healing is an option. Healing happens on many levels: physical, mental, spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you find a local psychic healer / reiki healer who can help you work on your fibromyalgia and give you guidance.
</p>

<p>
	Fibromyalgia especially is a spiritually-related illness. If you had a broken spine, that might be another matter.

<p>
	Yes, you can do that. Battling the ego can sometimes be a useful formuation, but often not. Often the better approach might be to love the ego to death, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that every formulation will be dualistic. Every teaching will be dualistic, even nondual teachings. True nonduality cannot be spoken.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Christianity is very dualistic in misleading ways.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the notion of being "a sinner" creates a battle between ego and God.
</p>

<p>
	"A sinner" is just a devil, ego, or self. But the sinner is an illusion. There is no sinner and no sin. Most Christians do not understand this. Christians gets trapped in the duality of good vs evil, which itself becomes the source of the illusion of evil. The mind creates evil by imagining it.
</p>

<p>

And to make matters worse, you then deny it and attack me for pointing it out to you <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	It feels like Infinite Love. Imagine if you loved every object in the universe as much as you love your mother, your children, or your dog. But more! Literally Infinite Love! It is completely unlimited. You Love so much that it grows bigger and bigger and bigger until you realize that it literally has no end whatsoever. By this point your entire self gets annihilated in this love and you literally die as a human self. You die and become God -- which is pure Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	That's Death!
</p>

<p>
	Death = Infinite Love
</p>

<p>
	Did you really think God would let you die into some hell? Don't confuse God for a devil. God has ensured that all beings die into Infinite Love. How did God guarantee this? By making Love and Death identical!

	It mustn't. There are no musts. You are God and you are free to play in the sandbox of your Mind for eternity.
</p>

<p>
	You can go become Hitler and kill 20 million people. God will still love you.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why all these egos (seem to) exist. God allows them because no one is forcing you not be a devil. God doesn't fight devils with force. God simply loves them to death, which means they exist temporarily.

</p>

<p>
	God's Love is so great that God isn't bothered by Hitler. Your love is so small that you hate Hitler. That's because you're a devil. If you realized you were God, you'd love Hitler as much as you love your mother. But this is far to radical for mankind to admit. That's because mankind are devils. But luckily God is perfectly okay with that!

<title>Does spiritual awakening lead to a desire of starting your own business/pathway?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	No, it all depends.
</p>

<p>
	Although in practice many awakened folks tend to run their own shops. Once you're that conscious it just doesn't makes sense to waste your consciousness working for some fool to earn him money.
</p>

<p>
	The point of awakening is that then you're in a great and rare position to help uplift the world. The world needs your conscious leadership. You don't awaken and then go work at Wall Street to make a killing, hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	Of course we do, because you are an ego. So your definition is deliberately backwards, to protect yourself. That how you survive.
</p>

<p>
	If you had an accurate definition of ego, you'd be dead. The ego's job is to ensure you don't understand what ego actually is.

<p>
	You could say it doesn't exist. It merely appears to.
</p>

<p>
	So you'll ask, "But what is the reason for it appearing to exist?"

<p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes. Since there is only ONE thing, and it is LOVE, everything must be it, including any appearances or illusions, and everything is done for the sake of maximizing Love.
</p>

<p>
	Which closes the loop of the final duality: Why is there selfishness? To maximize selflessness!
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness and selflessness are identical! Ta-da! Which means: the devil is God! Which means: evil is Good! Which means: there is no evil, only Love!
</p>

<p>
	So in this way God defeats the devil. Not by fighting with the devil, but by leaving no room for a devil to exist. There never was a devil (ego). The devil/evil was always an illusion. There was only ever LOVE.
</p>

<p>
	And all illusions are there to maximize Love, they are the expressions of Love. Without illusion and survival, there could not be Creation. So of course all of your suffering is out of Love.
</p>

Doesn't God create everything selflessly? Isn't ego the veil that allows God to love itself?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	God/Oneness/Consciousness/Nothingness/Infinity is Love
</p>

<p>
	God is creation itself. God is selflessness itself. God is Love.
</p>

<p>
	No, ego is the prism which polarizes God's Infinite Absolute Love into limited, finite, material love.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Love is like pure white light. Once that Love materializes into some formed thing, or through some finite creature, that Love is made finite and selfish. It is exactly like shining pure white light through a prism which polarizes it into many lesser discrete colors. The love shining through all humans is like the color blue or red or yellow. But God's Absolute Love is white, containing all the above, being the Source.
</p>

<p>
	So when God's Love shines through a dirty prism like Hitler or Trump -- that's what love looks like in its finite form.
</p>

<p>
	When God's Love shines through a pure lens, it looks like that of Jesus or Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is the lens/prism. When you realize that ego isn't real, its like removing all prisms from the path of the light, allowing it to shine white.
</p>

<p>
	The clearest telescope is one which has no lens at all. The clearest lens is Nothingness! When your lens is Nothingness, you are Truth, you are Love, you are God. You stop looking at things, you BECOME the things you used to look at.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, God's Creation is completely selfless. Since all selves are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, an asleep God wakes up to realize that he is God.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing other than God can awaken because there is nothing other than God! God is ONE, so who can awaken other than him to himself?
</p>

<p>

<p>
	The ego doesn't exist. The ego cannot awaken. The ego cannot learn anything. It is the realization that ego never was -- that it is a total illusion -- which allows God to realize that it was God the whole time.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is the mistaken idea that reality is divided into parts: me, you, her, him, them, animals, Jesus, aliens, God, etc. To realize ONENESS is to end all these divisions and exist as ONE. That ONE is the real God.
</p>

<p>
	If the ego could awaken, that would mean there are two things: ego & something else which it awakens to. That would be duality. But Truth is ONENESS. So there cannot be an ego.
</p>

<p>
	We speak of ego as though it's a thing, but really where's speaking of a non-thing. It's like speaking about a snake which is actually just a rope that we thought was a snake. There never were two things: a snake and a rope. Nor did the snake become the rope. There never was a snake at all! Only rope! The snake was just a confusion. Which leaves us with oneness, ropeness.

<title>Bobby's perspective vs actualized.org</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Watching that video, Bobby fundamentally misunderstands the notion of ONENESS and relativity.
</p>

<p>
	If God is ONE, if God is Infinite, you must be it. The distinction between self/other is relative. So there cannot be a difference between you and God, you and Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	To otherize God or Jesus is a monumental misunderstanding of spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	It is not the ego which wishes to become God. It's is GOD which wishes to awaken to GOD! To label the desire for God-realization as ego is basically the worst form of devilry (ignorance/selfishness) which forever keeps one separated from God.
</p>

<p>
	It has nothing to do with building a bigger Youtube channel, LOL.
</p>

<p>
	YOU ARE GOD! Wake up! Stop denying. It is actually the ego which pretends it is not God under a veil of false humility so that it can maintain a subtle sense of "other" and therefore maintain a sense of self. The ego makes God something other than itself so the ego could survival as a new spiritual ego, a Christian ego which is now a follower of Jesus. This is one of the ego's greatest self-deceptions and Bobby has fallen into it.
</p>

<p>
	ONENESS is the ultimate truth. Any sense of distinction or duality must collapse. Never forget this fundamental law.
</p>

<p>
	Bobby is God pretending to be a Christian who is not God. Bobby is God imagining Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	Bobby may have taken some psychedelics, but he did not properly contemplate and realize what they had to show him. Instead he fell back into selfishness. The humble Christian self is the ego in sheep's clothing.
</p>

<p>
	Like I keep saying, there are many, many degrees of comprehension and realization of what God is. Bobby is just scratching the surface of this whole thing. There is mindfuck after mindfuck yet for him to realize. Most important for him would be the realization that self and other are indistinguishable. "Leo" is just a figment of his (God's) imagination.
</p>

<p>
	It is not merely that the Holy Spirit flows through you -- NO! -- YOU ARE FUCKING GOD! The one and only! You are just trapped inside your own mind so deeply that you can't even imagine a way out.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you are visited by Jesus if you pray to him is because you are God imagining him! Your will creates this dream we call reality.
</p>

<p>
	Bobby's video is actually very useful because it illustrates how deep the self-deception can go. Even someone like him, who has studied Buddhism, psychedelics, Eastern mysticism, and even watched my videos -- can still fail to reach the deepest level of Truth by getting stuck at some lesser level. Which is why I constantly warn you guys about being so careful about your epistemology and the many degrees of realization. Spirituality is way more complex and tricky than you can imagine. Just when you think you've finally figured it out, you're self-deceived.
</p>

<p>
	I wish Bobby a quick recovery from his paradigm lock. So he can take back his full authority as the sole Creator of this Universe.
</p>

<p>
	This video is also a great example and reminder of how dangerous Christianity can be. It's an elaborate device of the devil to keep you from finding God. The devil achieves this precisely by co-opting the very thing you trust the most. Anything you blindly trust, the devil will use against you to hide God from you. You have to appreciate that the devil is pure, ingenious self-deception. The devil has turned self-deception into an artform the two crowning achievements of which are science and religion.

<p>
	Of course if there is a values mismatch that should kill it long-term. Sex can't resolve that problem.
</p>

<p>
	But if that's the case, cut it off rather than this kissing for 2 years until she gets a new boyfriend. That's just silly.
</p>

<p>
	With relationships, by dragging it out the suffering is made much worse.

	You're thinking about it in too limited a manner. It doesn't have to be immediate and direct.

<p>
	If you shit in a public pool, the shit will eventually come back to you because you'll be swimming around in it for a long time. That doesn't mean it will come back within 5 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Right now your logic is: "Well... the pool is quite large, so if I shit in the northwest corner but I swim in the southeast corner, chances of it coming back to me are low so maybe I can get away with it."

<p>
	Working with emotions is very tricky stuff because they are not logical and they completely control one's behavior and thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	Bulling your way through emotional issues with a cold heart and lots of discipline will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional issues require a compassionate, gentle, loving, mindful approach.
</p>

<p>
	It's about becoming heart-centered rather than stuck in your head. It's about feeling into things, feeling into your body.
</p>

<p>
	The whole macho attitude of dominating emotional problems has to go.

<p>
	He is great to listen to, but just keep in mind that he doesn't understand spirituality,  nonduality, awakening, love, etc.
</p>

<p>
	He makes some excellent points about politics and ideology that are worth integrating.
</p>

<p>
	He's not really a communist in the way most people use that term. He likes to be provocative. By "communist" all he really means is a larger role for the state, and moving towards world government.
</p>

<p>
	You can agree or disagree with him on that, but his points about how ideology works are quite profound and important to understand. He makes important structural points there.

	Look, even psychoanalysis can be useful. It all depends on how you use it and what level you want to reach.
</p>

<p>
	I am speaking from the point of reaching absolute understanding of Self and reality. It won't take you there.
</p>

<p>
	Shadow work is useful but it ain't awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Have to be clear about your goals to select the right methods. Sometimes you need shadow work. Sometimes you need nonduality.

<p>
	You can find God through Jesus, but it will be a very limited path and you will probably not understand that Jesus is imaginary and that you are God imagining him.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of understanding what God is. The deepest levels are nondual and formless, so any kind of imagery like Jesus will get in the way. It's also crucial to understand that all spiritual imagery is relative. You could worship an elephant-man and it would work the same as Jesus. Because it's all imaginary. To get stuck on one set of imagery is so limiting.

<p>
	Not a belief, a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you were in a different state of consciousness you could become a kangaroo. But you aren't there. Changing states of consciousness is a real challenge because it defines "physical reality". It has to appear rock solid for reality to feel solid and not dreamlike.

</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you are looking. But there is no you.
</p>

<p>
	For awakening, that sense of you-ness must collapse. The mind will do every slippery thing possible to maintain the sense of you-ness. It's basically impossible to imagine what life would feel like without a you.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at the room, but while imagining you were never born. Notice the room is there without you.
</p>

<p>
	The sense of you is stuck to the room like toilet paper on a shoe, and it refuses to come off, since obviously that would be the end for you.
</p>

<title>Closing in Game</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44638-closing-in-game/?do=findComment&amp;comment=561576</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Closing involves a lot of factors and is an art in itself. This is perhaps the most advanced aspect of game on which hinge most of your results.
</p>

<p>
	Basically closing requires being really experienced at these things:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Screening her to make sure she's possible to isolate
	</li>
	<li>
		Being really good at planning logistics on the fly. Being really good at improvising new plans
	</li>
	<li>
		Leading -- getting her used to following you around
	</li>
	<li>
		Bouncing between various locations
	</li>
	<li>
		A convenient place to isolate her to (could be her place, or even a rented motel room, or even behind the elevator)
	</li>
	<li>
		Dealing with last minute resistance, shit-tests, and endless excuses
	</li>
	<li>
		Dealing with her annoying friends who will try to cockblock you every chance they get
	</li>
	<li>
		Seduction -- physically and emotionally turning her on.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	How do you learn all the above? Lots of trial and error, watching other experienced guys do it, and by studying some basic theory.
</p>

<p>
	Expect a lot of failure and near misses.
</p>

<p>
	One of the dirty secrets of PUA is that even the best guys only close like 50% of the women they manage to bring home. In the end, you can't force her. And many times she will be too relucant. But even to reach this point already takes serious skill. Just learning how to isolate her is tricky. There will be so many excuses and logistical obstacles. Endless excuses.
</p>

<p>
	Even once you get her panties off, it's still not a lock. You can lose her at any point. You can even lose her while you're inside her! It's a circus.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing will increase you lay count more than having a convenient place very near to where you met her. This is HUGE! It's so important it's worth paying an extra $1000/mo for it. Living within walking distance of the club/bar is priceless in game. If you have to drive 40 mins to your Mom's house, forget about it.
</p>

<p>
	A lot more meditation is required. Serious meditation which turns into mystical experience.

<p>
	That should be plainly obvious when you watch how conservatives defend Trump and war.
</p>

<p>
	They operate from an entirely different (and lower) level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who advocates for war gives himself away right away. That tells you who they are. A highly conscious being would never advocate for war.
</p>

<p>
	To be fair, plenty of centrist neoliberals also advocate for war. They are slightly more evolved, but not by much.
</p>

<p>
	Also the nationalism is a dead givaway of low consciousness. Nationalism is what gives rise to the racism, xenophobia, homophobia, mysogeny, culture wars, and fascistic/authoritarian leanings.
</p>

<p>
	Why do all the Republican Senators support Trump's brazen illegality and devilry? Because in their heart they like the notion of a strongman / authoritarian, as long as he is THEIR authoritarian. So they follow like sheep.
</p>

<p>
	Liberals are less inclined to behave this way. Liberals are less conformist, more free-thinking (even though they still of course get trapped in group-think).
</p>

<p>
	Studies show that liberals have higher openmindedness. Which is a key dimension of consciousness. You can't be conscious and closedminded at the same time.
</p>

And that is already happening.
</p>

<p>
	But it takes wealth and development to do that. In a world where many people are still starving, junk food is a step forward for them because it is cheap. They cannot afford better.
</p>

<p>
	Concerns about organic and whole food doesn't emerge until stage Green. 80% of the world isn't there yet.

<title>Psychedelics Paradox</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44596-psychedelics-paradox/?do=findComment&amp;comment=561367</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Psychedelics are a catalyst for facing one's shadow and transcending one's ego. The more dysfunctional one's ego is, the more shadow one has, the less stable one's mind is, the more things can go wrong during a trip.
</p>

<p>
	People with mental illness or disorders need psychedelics more than anyone, but they are also less likely to handle facing their shadow.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a high stakes bet for such people. If you win, you win big. If you lose, it will be hell.
</p>

<p>
	Proper and very gradual dosing is crucial in such cases. You don't want to bite off more than you can chew. The less mentally stable and whole that you are, the less you can chew, the less you should bite.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you are mentally unstable the less likely you are to follow my advice, the more sloppy your approach will be, the more likely you are to overdose and freak out. Ignorance cannot help being ignorant.
</p>

Your body is bald precisely because it adapted to wearing clothing.

If you are not addicted to sex, how do you know when to have sex?

<p>
	Consciousness is the solution to these issues. The more conscious you become the more wholesome your actions become overall, the more you act in alignment with wisdom and intelligence.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This just doesn't square with the facts.
</p>

<p>
	Humans have successfully adapted to cold environs for 100,000s of years. In fact, cold climates are more ideal for the growth of civilization, which is why the most developed countries are from the north, generally speaking.
</p>

<p>
	Eskimos are well adpated to living in Alaska and Nepalese have specially adapted lungs for living in the high altitudes. They can climb Mt Everest without oxygen tanks when most white people need to use oxygen tanks.
</p>

<p>
	And of course our skin colors have fully adapted to the climate we hail from.
</p>

<p>
	Evolution adapts fast. It's always adapting, even today.
</p>

<p>
	Humans and technology go hand in hand. These two cannot be treated seperately. Technology is a huge part of our evolution. We have adapted to cooked meat, fire, clothing, etc. long ago.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, we lived through the ice age and ate all the mammoths (probably). If you hail from Europe, eating mammoths is in your DNA.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's exactly the solution.
</p>

<p>
	Go be around people of various races and cultures until you stop seeing them as other or weird.
</p>

<p>
	Racism is very simple: it happens because people get stuck in a small circle of those who look like them and think like them. If everyone traveled around the world and interacted with people of all races and cultures, racism would disappear in a few generations.
</p>

<p>
	People deliberately segment themselves into like-minded enclaves in order to avoid expanding their sense of self and realizing their oneness with all beings.
</p>

<p>
	This is why people in major cities are less racist than those who live in the countryside. Because in a big city you are forced to interact with those who are different than you, but in the countryside you're living among your own kind, living in a racial/ethnic bubble.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, stopping wanting to cling to your own kind enough though that is what's more comfortable for your ego-mind.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	My point is not about politics. It's about the attachments you're exhibiting. You are missing the point of what I said to you, because you're stuck on matters of content.
</p>

<p>
	I let people know about pundits' fallacies in a non-attached way, conscious of the relativity of my perspective. That is the crucial difference. You are on here pushing an agenda every week. It's a question of attachment vs detachment for your own perspective.

Let it go. The way you comment is not in the spirit of our work here. Free your mind of that shit.
</p>

<p>
	All this political stuff you must hold very loosely, otherwise it turns into just another ideology. The content of your ideology is irrelevant, what matters is that your mind is stuck on it.
</p>

<p>
	Our work here is not to find better content to cling to, but to go meta and become conscious of the relativity of all content held. When you become conscious of this, you stop judging and blaming people.

<p>
	There is no how.
</p>

<p>
	Your looking for a how is the dualistic mistake.

<p>
	You are engaged in the process of asking what the Earth stands upon? Elephants. And what do the elephants stand upon? A turtle. And so on...

<p>
	This entire pursuit of elephants and turtles is misguided. There is just the Earth! No elephants or turtles. No how. 100% direct. Nothing is hidden. You need to realize that and stop chasing your tail.

<p>
	Lol, that is his fundamental mistake.
</p>

<p>
	He's running away from himself with his philosophical work. And it's obvious just by looking at his neurotic ticks when he speaks.
</p>

<p>
	This is the problem with academic philosophy. All brains, no consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is that there is no difference between inside and outside. But if Zizek would turn within, he'd discover God. Which is a problem for him, since he's an avowed atheist/materialist. So he keeps looking outside, forever lost in his own mind.

<p>
	Yes, there are clues.

	It's not a physical blockage, it's an energetic blockage.

No explanation will work because all explanations are dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	So try all you want, but you will always fail. The only solution is to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why Zen masters do not answer your questions. Because all your questions are misguided attempts by the ego-mind to maintain its dualistic delusional reality.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to this problem exists on a new plane of consciousness from the one you're currently at. You will not be able to reason your way to that new plane.

<p>
	Just goes to show how stuck the mind can get in stage Orange ideologies.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that a human can survive independent of society is a complete fiction. There has never been such a time in 300,000 years of human history. Less developed government means MORE dependence, not less. In tribal cultures humans are totally dependent on the tribe. No one is a lone libertarian wolf there.

	I'm a lone wolf type guy so I avoid these issues simply by keep to myself and following my life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	If someone is being an ass to you, leave their company. If it's a boss or coworker, then that's more challenging but that's basically turning into workplace harassment. You should be able to speak to HR about that and get them to stop. If it's a friend, change friends. If it's a family member, move away from your family or confront them about it. If it's happening at school, just ignore the person and stay away from them.

</p>

<p>
	There is a structural difference between the two. A stage Green person has no desire to be a fascist. They have outgrown that. They have a desire to support others who are different than them.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, sometimes a Green person might get upset or act foolish, but they will not create a fascist government.
</p>

<p>
	TYT is never going to lead to fascism, but Fox News could. Of course TYT can still be biased and lead to other lesser problems. CNN would also never lead to fascism because they are above that.

<p>
	Keep in mind that things have evolved a lot since Da Vinci's time.
</p>

<p>
	Today to succeed you must be more specialized. You can't be an architect, a painter, an engineer, and a writer because you will be out-competed by others who specialize in just one thing.
</p>

<p>
	Back in Da Vinci's time fields like engineering, architecture, etc. were not as developed or deep as they are today. It will take you 10 years of study just to become a decent engineer. And now you need work experience, licenses, certifications, etc.
</p>

<p>
	So you can certainly be a polymath in the casual sense of studying lots of topics, but you ain't gonna master them all enough to make a career out of. Pick your career field more carefully. Even something like Engineering is far too broad. You need to pick what kind of engineer you want to be.
</p>

<p>
	Competition is a lot more fierce today. So many amazing specialists to compete against. And it's a global marketplace. In Da Vinci's time the marketplace was a single city of 300,000 people, most of whom were peasants who couldn't read.
</p>

<p>
	I would prefer to go vegetarian for ethical reasons if it didn't disrupt my life too much.
</p>

<p>
	Of course taste of the food is a factor. Meat probably tastes better to me. But that could be retrained.
</p>

<p>
	But for example, I don't like eating fruit all the time. It becomes too sugary and gross. I don't know how people pull that off for long periods of time even if it gives them enough energy. My body doesn't tolerate a fruit only diet.

<p>
	It's not true acceptance if in the back of your mind you're accepting it only so that you can avoid facing it.
</p>

<p>
	"I accept that I have gay desires as long as that means I won't ever have any gay sex" << that's not acceptance!
</p>

<p>
	True acceptance would be: "It's okay if the only kind of sex I have in my life from now on is gay sex."
</p>

<p>
	Acceptance requires that you face the thing you don't want to face. Not hypothetically, but actually. That doesn't mean you actually have to have sex with a man, but you do have to face and accept the prospect of it until the point where it doesn't bother you.

<p>
	Yeah, what I'm saying is impossible to imagine from your current state of consciousness. You'd need a radical change of state.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, time and even cause & effect collapse in nonduality such that the impossible becomes possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can clearly recognize that you are the entire universe happening all at once. This is nondual awakening. No, it's not any analogy or explanation. You are the whole universe happening as we speak.
</p>

<p>
	Just as one example, I once became conscious that I wrote every book mankind has ever created. Not only did I write all the books in the universe, I am all of them too. The pages of every book is made out of my consciousness. And this goes for everything in the universe. I am everything that could ever possibly be. All of this is direct absolute truth. Not explanation or thinking or theory. It is not even perception. It is more true than perception and more true than mathematics.

			If child's needs aren't addressed by the parents, it will learn to satisfy them unconsciously by adopting coping mechanisms that will last a lifetime unless addressed. That is where the sex part comes in - these unconscious behaviors usually come bunched up with sex because it is an "adult" form of love.

<p>
	Sure, but it's all overblown.
</p>

<p>
	Your mother and father and sex are not that important.
</p>

<p>
	Unless your mother or father molested you, it's not a big deal.

<p>
	The ultimate truth is that male and female are both just aspects of your infinite self. You can have male and female orgasms. Both masculine and feminine energies are running through you and you will become most powerful once you integrate them both and experience life from both POVs.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine how powerful you would be if you were totally comfortable with your sexuality no matter what it was. That is true strength.
</p>

<p>
	To worry or fear about being gay is weakness.
</p>

<p>
	This is why Self-Love is the ultimate strength. It requires total fearlessness. So this is great opportunity for you to train yourself to be strong. A strong man is able to have sex with another man. A weak man is not. Your culture has this all backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Dude, look at the silliness of your position.
</p>

<p>
	If you desire to be fucked, that's YOUR DESIRE, YOUR WANT. The problem is that you are denying your own wants. The solution is to accept your own wants. It is your right to deny your own wants or embrace them.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I came to you and said I want to eat ice cream. But I don't want ice cream. I hate ice cream. Don't I have a right to hate ice cream? I'm so unlucky to want ice cream.
</p>

<p>
	You would call me insane.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is simply that your culture has brainwashed you to believe that men aren't supposed to enjoy getting fucked. But all that is, is cultural brainwashing. You must question your own cultural norms and assumptions until you realize that they are completely arbitrary, groundless, and even dysfunctional, as in this case. Your culture tells you that men shouldn't enjoy getting fucked, yet the truth is that many men in your culture enjoy it. So what is the point of following a culture which is so clearly untruthful? You'd have to be crazy to buy into such a culture. Then again, you were brainwashed into it from birth, so it feels like it shouldn't be questioned.

<p>
	You are all bodies, all beings, all things.

<p>
	If you woke up as a kangaroo tomorrow, you'd still be asking, "Why this kangaroo? Why not something else?" And so it would go until you went through every being and ended up right where you are right now. Someone has to be in your shoes. So here you are! Actually, no one is in your shoes. No one is in everyone's shoes, looking through everyone's eyes.

<p>
	The bottom line is, since you are the only being in existence, you have to be in all places at once. So you are in this place right now. Every place is as important as any other.

<p>
	Yeah, it really depends a lot on the culture. It won't fly so well in under-developed countries with traditional cultures like the Middle East.
</p>

<p>
	If your friends are stage Orange/Green or Green, it should be okay. But low Orange and below will be a problem. Blue will be a big problem.
</p>

<p>
	Homosexuals basically don't exist in Blue cultures. Because they are demonized and even killed if they come forward. Blue forces a repression of homosexuality. It's a total denial.

<p>
	I'm no expert on it, but the whole theme of interpreting human actions as a desire for sex, sexual organs, hidden perverted sexual desires, and all the mother/father stuff is just way too overblown.
</p>

<p>
	A being's actions are not primarily about sex, they are about self-survival. Sex is a tiny part of that. Psychoanalysis doesn't understand this and of course it doesn't understand spirituality, self-transcendence, nonduality, epistemology, or metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	Freud projected his own sexual perversions onto the world and saw in the world a reflection of his own neurotic shadow self. But just because Freud was that way doesn't mean we all are that way. In fact most of us are not.
</p>

<p>
	I don't find Freud's theories useful for personal development or self-transcendence. There are much better frameworks. Most self-help frameworks are better. Go grab any random book in the self-help isle of the bookstore and you will get better and more useful advice for improving your life than by reading Freud. Any book on my book list will be far better.
</p>

<title>Overcoming stage green ego</title>

<p>
	I agree we need to distinguish between progressives and neoliberals/centrists.
</p>

<p>
	But how it's done is also important. It's important to recognize that lots of people are neoliberals and centrist liberals because that is their level of development. You can't brow-beat them into becoming progressives. Almost by definition progressives are the rarest ones on the political spectrum.
</p>

<p>
	So while it's important to not confuse a neoliberal for a progressive, attacking neoliberals and centrist Dems is problematic because you just can't convert all Dems into progressives. There needs to be coalition and some mutual acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	My problem with Jimmy Dore is that I feel he's too aggressive. It's like red meat for progressives but it won't work to build a coalition. Being a rabid dog is not a good way to go. Bernie is very progressive but he's not so rabid and obnoxious about it, which allows him to attract people who normally wouldn't call themselves progressives or socialists or whatever.

	A very important principle for you to learn is that of meeting people where they're at. This will come up for you over and over again in life if you're going to be an advanced human. A lot of people will not be as advanced as you, and your solution to that cannot be to obnoxiously attack or "otherize" them.

<p>
	Remember that these are all your brothers and sisters. That is the real challenge. It would be so much easier if we could otherize half the population and lock them up in Montana. But we can't.

<p>
	Why doesn't it make sense? Unconsciousness leads to suffering.

<p>
	Unconditional Love definitely has a feeling to it, too.
</p>

<p>
	You're simply missing a mystical experience of Love. Try contemplating what love is on a psychedelic. You're disconnected from Being, and thinking about love in the abstract is not going to be enough to reconnect you. You need a direct experience to jolt you awake.
</p>

<p>
	You might also want to optimize your brain health, mental health, nutrition, energy, etc. to make sure that some chemical imbalance or energetic block is not obstructing you. Get blood work done. Check for vitamin deficiencies, heavy metal toxicity, etc. Dial in your health because it is the foundation for everything else.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you have too much lead or mercury in your brain, you may not be able to feel love the way you otherwise could.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't feel anything, that shows me some deeper underlying chemical or health issue. Or possibly some energetic blockage. That is not normal. Start researching your symptoms.
</p>
