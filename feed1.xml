<p>
	Lol, that's the rub.
</p>

<p>
	You are God playing a devil. So unless you decide to stop being a devil, and accept yourself as God, you will be a devil.
</p>

<p>
	No one can awaken you but you because you are the only thing there is.
</p>

<p>
	Since you are God you have infinite power to deny that you are God. And that's what you're so busy doing. You don't like the things I say because it interferes with your denial process.

<p>
	That doesn't mean it's free of corruption and falsehoods.
</p>

<p>
	Since God creates all falsehoods too.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is distinguishing the truth from the falsehoods.

<p>
	I just want to caution you guys once again of the extraordinary subtly and depth of this work.
</p>

<p>
	There is no more advanced work for human beings than this. So watch your step. Don't think you can just barge in here, watch a few videos, and figure out all of life. Not. So. Fast! There are traps! Thousands of traps.
</p>

<p>
	If you want very deep understanding you better be ready for some very deep and careful study.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to appreciate the things I talk about unless you read at least 100 books. But even that is still just the beginning of this journey. There is no deeper or more challenging human endeavor than holistic, stage Turquoise+ spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	But also none as rewarding.
</p>

Otherwise they could not occur. You can't make GTA do anything which isn't already coded into it, by definition.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the programmers themselves do not have a full understanding of all the possibilities they coded, because the possibilities are infinite. They'd have to have an infinite mind to know that.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, you'd have to play an infinite number of GTA sessions in order to fully know what GTA is. So no one actually knows what GTA is other than God, who has played through everything everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	That's what omniscience is: the state of all possible unfoldings of reality unfolded in zero time.
</p>

<p>
	From God's ultimate POV, everything which can happen has happened because it is outside of time. Everyone is just one singularity, like a tiny seed. Except this is an infinite seed which holds all possible universes. Every video game that could ever be made exists in that seed. And every object that could ever exist.

	"Want" is a poetic word here. More accurately God just is. Is-ing and wanting boil down to the same thing.

<p>
	God is fully actualized at all times. What appears to you to be a process which takes time (people being born & dying) from God's POV has all happened in less than on trillionth of a second. Actually in zero time.
</p>

<p>
	Everything that will ever happen in the universe has already happened from God's POV.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity was fully actualized in zero time for eternity. But for a human to be a human, it must appear as though infinity is slowly unfolding. In truth it exists as folded & unfolded simultaneously because there isn't a difference between the two at the Absolute level.
</p>

<p>
	Think of a video game cartridge which already has all the possible gameplay sessions coded in it at once. In a sense, a video game is just an infinite possibility space. Every time you play it, it is different. But all the possible paths are already there baked into the cart. There's nothing you can do which will "surprise" the cart. In a sense, the cart "knows" all. You just have to tell it which paths you want to take.
</p>

<p>
	God is the entire cart AND all the individual gameplay sessions which can be played. The two are actually identical.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard for the mind to understand or appreciate such an abstract point from the outset. You have to get deep into the work to appreciate that the snake will eat its own tail.
</p>

<p>
	The work is self-undermining, as any truthful teaching must be, because reality is groundless. So no teaching can actually become a solid ground. As soon as it does, it's a false teaching.
</p>

<p>
	I explained this long ago in my epistemology episodes. But hardly anyone takes those episodes seriously enough.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of reality is such that it cannot ever be pinned down. Anything you say it is, it also isn't, and it is also more than both. That is the nature of infinity.

<p>
	The point of all of my pointers is that they will eventually undermine and devour themselves, like a snake eating its own tail.
</p>

<p>
	My goal is to take you on this amazing journey through your mind, for years, until one day you have an awakening so deep and so profound that you say: OH-MY-GOD! It's all NOTHING! Everything Leo was talking about was just a giant cosmic divine circle jerk which I created for myself in order to realize the fully glory of myself as God. OH-MY-GOD! But why was all this necessary? To show you the enormity of your own mind.
</p>

<p>
	Of course none of it is necessary. I just like exploring the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Don't think of my teachings as logical proofs. They are poetry and art.
</p>

<p>
	All we're doing here is celebrating the profundity of yourself as God.

			What about all the detailed statements you make about Absolute Truth in your videos.  Are those just mental scaffolding, yes or no?  How are all those detailed claims like just pointing to Absolute Truth?  You seem to want to have it both ways.  You want to point and you want to talk about it factually.  I think this is a problem.  It's a case of having your cake and eating it too.  Am I right?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said, some ways of speaking about the Absolute are more "accurate" or "better" than others. This is a relative matter. It's a matter of fit between teacher and student. You might resonant more with the teachings of someone very different from me. I present things in a way which I feel is modern and appeals to ordinary folks on Youtube in the 21st century.
</p>

<p>
	Those detailed claims are still pointers. Like I could make very detailed claims about New York City to you, but none of them are the same as New York City itself. When you reach NYC itself, you'll see that my pointers were "correct" in many ways, but also not at all the same as NYC. Pointers are poetic devices which capture the essence of a thing.
</p>

<p>
	Try to describe the smell of a rose in words. You see the problem? Your words will never be it. But some words are better than others. If I wrote: "a rose smells like rotten fish" << that would be bad poetry. If I wrote: "a rose smells delicate and soft like a baby's bottom" << that's much closer
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as literal understanding. All understanding is poetic.
</p>

			But you've made numerous and specific claims about the Absolute that not everybody who has claimed to "know" the Absolute has made or endorsed by any measure.  Most people believe that Truth cannot be expressed in words.  You've used a lot of words to describe Truth very specifically.  Surely this is not some cannonical Absolute Truth that you're talking about -- this is your version of it, your twist on it.   Wouldn't you agree?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said above, the mind will understand and speak of the Absolute in a thousand different ways depending on culture, era, brain type, personality type, past lives, genetics, language, etc. You must distinguish the Absolute itself from anything said about it. Anything said about it is always poetic, we might say. There is no one right or wrong type of poetry. Although some types are "higher" or more "truthful" than others. Not all poetry is equally good or equally effective at pointing out the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Which poetry you prefer will be relative to your mind, your ego, and your needs. If you are an atheist, poetry about God will not inspire you to discover the Absolute. You will prefer more scientific like maps and models. So when I speak of God, that turns a lot of atheistically-minded people off. But this cannot really be avoided since what they refuse to admit is God. And God is the most accurate word for it.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind that there are many facets and degrees of depth to the Absolute. So not every awakened person has realized all the facets and degrees. So they may speak of one facet but not the other. This problem is called the 5 Blind Men And The Elephant (google it). Very, very few people have seen the entire elephant fully.

<p>
	Every word that comes out of my mouth is mental scaffolding.
</p>

<p>
	But beyond that is Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	It I cannot speak because I am it.
</p>

<p>
	No one can ever speak Absolute Truth, they can merely point to it.
</p>

<p>
	My teachings are "true" in the sense that they do a decent job of pointing you towards Absolute Truth. But they are not it. But also they are!
</p>

<p>
	That is the divine paradox. You should expect a strange loop here due to the self-reference problem.
</p>

<p>
	Since you ARE the Absolute Truth, you cannot think it or speak it. Absolute Truth is prior to thought or speech, yet it is also not separate from them. Because Absolute Truth is total ONENESS.

<p>
	It's not a thesis. It's Absolute Truth!
</p>

<p>
	See, the reason you have a hard time accepting this is because you still hold Truth as a mental thing. It isn't. If it's a mental thing, it isn't Absolute Truth. Once Truth stops being a mental/conceptual thing for you, once you BECOME THE TRUTH, there cannot be any more doubt, because doubt is a mental thing.
</p>

<p>
	Doubt is actually fear and delusion.
</p>

<p>
	God does not doubt itself. Other than via the devils it creates. It's the devil who doubts.

	Absolute Truth is Absolute. So of course it's certain.

<p>
	The two are deeply one.
</p>

<p>
	God gives you guidance if you ask for it and listen carefully to your highest thoughts and feelings. Your highest feelings are God speaking to you. Or rather it is you reconnecting with the Goodness of God.
</p>

<p>
	But also, suffering IS deep guidance. You may not like it but suffering shows you the way to God.

<p>
	Yes, it's extremely loaded. As all spiritual terminology is, precisely because the devil/ego deliberately corrupts it.

<p>
	The "I" you're referring to in that statement is ego. Ego can fabricate whatever it wants, but that's not Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	However you think reality is, is how it will appear to you. Because you are imagining the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you and I are one. So you and I both ARE the Truth. Truth is not something you "have". It's what you ARE. And it is the same for all people. But the mind will understand it and speak of it many different ways.
</p>

<p>
	It's also important to distinguish relative from absolute truth. You can "have" your relative truths which will be different for all people, but Absolute Truth is one.
</p>

<p>
	I will have videos in the future explaining the differences between absolute and relative truth, and what Truth really is. It's a complicated and nuanced topic.

<p>
	Not with that attitude.
</p>

<p>
	There can be no access to Truth without radical openmindedness.
</p>

<p>
	The things I talk about are extremely advanced. Do not make a mockery of these teachings with simplistic expectations. You mind will absolutely not be able to warp itself around the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	I've told you guys many times the importance and trickeries of epistemology.
</p>

<p>
	You don't know what you don't know. You don't know what you can or cannot know. Hence the wisest course of action would be remain radically open and tread carefully.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you disagree with the things I say does not make them false. There is also the possibility that your ability to discern truth from falsehood is corrupted by ego and lack of consciousness such that when you hear the highest truths they will sound preposterous to you. Precisely because that's what serves your survival and maintains your imaginary worldview.

</p>

<p>
	I've told you many times. Verify everything I say.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're not understamding what I said is because you have not reached those levels of consciousness because you aren't doing the practices seriously enough and you are not studying the books seriously enough.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	Stay openminded. Don't let the religious language fool you.
</p>

<p>
	You will eventually discover that Truth and the good life are identical.
</p>

<p>
	There will come a point in your growth when your understanding will be so deep you will sound like a madman to others. They will not be able to know how you know the things you know. And yet you will possess the highest Truth. And no one will understand you nor will you be able to explain yourself. And so it must be. Because by that point you will have done 10-20 years of work which no one else is willing to do.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Watch your projections.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot imagine, symbolize, or qualify the Absolute in any way whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
	So you might as well stop trying. It will never work and you will waste years of your life trying.
</p>

<p>
	At some point you have to ditch all metaphor, maps, and symbols because none of them are the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	You must to the meditative practices.

<title>How to make videos without it being cringe?</title>

<p>
	It takes some practice before your videos will be release worthy.
</p>

<p>
	Make like 50 videos just for yourself. Just for practice and experimentation. So there is no pressure to publish them.
</p>

<p>
	Then you'll be much better.
</p>

<p>
	A writter doesn't release his first 50 pieces of writting, nor does an artist. It takes a lot of practice in any field to reach the point where your work is ready for public release.
</p>

<p>
	With making videos it's actually easier than with music, writting, or painting. Those all requires many years of practice to release anything decent.
</p>

<p>
	That's definitely more challenging.
</p>

<p>
	At your age I would spend more time on awakening and spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can work on some books and so forth, or start a community, but also your priorities should be different at your age. It's less about impacting the world and more about deepening your spiritual connection with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is more satisfying than meeting any career objectives anyhow. You don't want to be filling the last quarter of your life with a busy work schedule at the cost of your spirituality.
</p>

<title>Awareness: is it a witness?</title>

</p>

<p>
	What you're missing is that this field of consciousness which everything is, is infinitely intelligent. Everything you see is materialized by this pure intelligence via Will into being.
</p>

<p>
	"Physical reality" is actually occuring inside a giant Mind which "thinks" it into being. Like a dream.
</p>

<p>
	Start to deeply notice the intelligence of every little thing around you. Every particle of dust is filled with infinite intelligence. Once you start to notice it, it will take your breath away. You've just gotten to used to overlooking the intelligence of everything.
</p>

<p>
	Also, there is no how. The very mechanism of reality is before you on full display. Reality does not work via any mechanism. It is impossibly direct. The how is the what. What a thing is is exactly how it is coming into being. In nonduality there are no mechanisms because those are all dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard for people to appreciate how radical this is. It means, for example, that your sense organs are not actually causing your perceptions. Nonduality denies sense organs basically because all of that is mechanical, dualistic, and indirect.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality breaks all scientific chains of causation. From a certain level of consciousness you will see that there is no causation at all. Everything is instant manifestion. As if the whole universe exists in suspended animation.
</p>

<p>
	It is Eternal and Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Keep tripping and you will discover more of these facets of God.
</p>

<p>
	Awareness is nothing. Even to call it a witness is too much and incorrect. There is no witness. The witness is nothing. If you turn your gaze back in on itself and ask what it is, you can feel there's nothing there. That's your so-called "witness". Just zero.
</p>

<title>What is the difference between yellow and turquoise?</title>

<p>
	Was this not explained in the Turquoise video??
</p>

<p>
	You won't really understand Turquoise unless you hang out with some Turquoise level people and have some mystical experiences while you are at Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	It's not enough to just have mystical experiences, as you could have them at Purple, Blue, Orange, Green. Your cognitive development must already be at Yellow and then the mystical experiences will push you past Yellow in Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	Firstly, there is shaktipat which is how some gurus awaken their students.
</p>

<p>
	But more importantly the guru cannot wake you up because you do not want to awaken. So they will never force any teaching on you. You are the obstacle here! No one can wash you of yourself but yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The only people who will awaken are those who seriously want it and are willing to pay any price to get it.
</p>

<p>
	You are God making yourself unenlightened. If you wish to awaken, stop doing that.

<p>
	It's useful to distinguish between two kinds of intelligence:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>

	</li>
	<li>
		Holistic, synthetic, heart-centered, soul-centered, big picture, spiritual, wise, unitive

			I'm having a hard time understanding what the function is of our own mind? It seems we are in constant battle with it, being deluded by it and for what reason? it almost seems like the mind is separate from existence or god and we need to get rid of it to see god. But if all is one what's the place and function of our own mind? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The function is very straight-forward actually: to keep you alive as yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is not a bad thing. It's just so relentlessly focused on its own survival that it tends to shoot itself in the foot.
</p>

<p>
	Without the mind the human race could not exist. But too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15239-nivsch/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="15239" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15239-nivsch/" rel="">@Nivsch</a> It's hopeless trying to convince such people (strong right-wing Blue) because they will always project their own biases onto you or the model you're presenting. Because they are not aware of how their mind is working backwards from their conclusions. Their dogmatic position is that right-wing is superior to left-wing. This is held as an absolute. And they have no interest in questioning that. So their mind will do all sorts of mental gymnastics to have that look true for them. They will cherry-pick evidence and use whatever rationalizations are available in order to generate their conclusion.
</p>

<p>
	Of course left-wingers also do this to some extent because this is not a left vs right thing, but a fundamental mechanic of the ego-mind. But right-wingers do it a lot more precisely because they are less cognitively developed on average. Of course you are never going to be able to convince them of this, precisely because they are not open to it.
</p>

<p>
	There is no cure for closedmindness.
</p>

<p>
	"The mind of a bigot is like the pupil of the eye. The more light you shine on it, the more it will contract." — Oliver Wendell Holms
</p>

<p>
	If everyone could be convinced of their bigotry and closedmindedness, half the world's problems would be solved overnight. The whole trick is that people are in denial about it. And what's worse they are in denial that they are in denial. That's just the nature of ignorance. It cannot help being ignorant.
</p>

<p>
	It is also almost always the case that such right-wingers have a very poor understanding of history. Right-wingers do not have an accurate historical understanding of Hitler, Stalin, nationalism, white supremacy, Marxism, capitalism, racism, civil rights, slavery, feminism, The Constitution, etc, and government in general. They are not interested in deeply exploring these issues other than as a way of justifying their pre-existing dogmas.
</p>

<p>
	Because the whole point of being a right-winger is that you have some position which you wish to defend out of a sense of fear of losing it. You have some position which you hold as absolute which is actually merely relative. This makes genuine inquiry virtually impossible. Such reactive egoic motives corrupt all inquiry towards truth.
</p>

<p>
	But good luck convincing a Blue/Orange right-winger of any of this.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the left-wing in also not immune. But still better.
</p>

One of those is your present human experience.
</p>

<p>
	Try not to think of Nirvana as somewhere or somewhen else. It is precisely THIS and NOW! But you ain't conscious of it.

	Plugging can last as long as 1-2 hrs. Usually closer to 1 hr.
</p>

<p>
	You struggle to remember it because it is not a memory but the very present moment. So any memory of it will not be it. You can't capture Nothingness in any way. It must be located NOW, NOW, NOW. No symbols can be used.

<p>
	I am not attacking you.
</p>

<p>
	I just notice you keep getting caught up in these reactive patterns. That's something to outgrow, if you want. It must be painful. Why not put an end to it? You don't want to live life defending yourself. You want to be creative instead.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13817-ivankiss/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13817" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13817-ivankiss/" rel="">@ivankiss</a> That's outside of stuff I've experienced. My experiences of God/Absolute are not like that at all.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe lay off the weed? It might be adding to your paranoia.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you might be having a kundalini awakening/activation. That would explain the body shaking and so forth. It might help you do some kind of body work to ground yourself or shake out the energy. Maybe Osho's dynamic meditation or just shaking your whole body like a madman. Chanting can also be helpful. When overwhelming energy comes up for you, try chanting AUM very long and deep from your belly, over and over again while also pounding your chest like a drum. Get a nice rythym going.
</p>

<p>
	I think you are doing okay. You just want to listen more to your body and let natural feelings show you the way. Trust your feelings. Let this process unfold and massage you. Sounds to me like God is taking over your mind and body. This is great. Let it take you over and rewire you. Surrender to it in high faith. Surrender to the highest love and truth. Set that intention every day. The ultimate goal is to let God take over your body. This requires a collapse of the old ego-mind. So that you become like a superconductor for God.
</p>

<p>
	This is exciting stuff! You've broken through to some deep awakening. Looks like you hooked a whale. Now slowly reel it in. Be patient with it. Really listen to your intution and highest feelings, not your rational mind. Allow your body to do whatever it wants to do (without hurting yourself).
</p>

<p>
	Prayer can be very helpful here. Prayer here would be you setting your intention to let God take over you for the highest good. Visualize what you want! This should help you cut through negative thinking and fear. Use your heart too! It's a powerful tool you can activate at any moment with feelings of love. Use that to cut through fear and doubt.
</p>

<p>
	Get clear about what you want in all of this. What is your intention? Do you want to be God? Do you want to surrender? Do you want the highest awakening? Intention is paramount here. Otherwise you are like a leaf blowing in the wind. Take control of the process, not from your mind but from your heart and soul. What does your soul want here?
</p>

	Indeed. You are too comfortable and complacent. Which is exactly why suffering exists. It's the only way a fool learns to wake up <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that your life can turn sour any second. Your health is not going to last. People around you will die. Etc. This is basically all guaranteed. You just ignore it to live your comfy life. It will not last. Not a chance. Life can turn really sour towards the end. What are you doing to prepare?
</p>

<p>
	People don't realize how "bad" life can get until its too late and they're stuck. The wise person prepares.
</p>

<p>
	But the biggest tragedy is simply what you miss out on by not living from an inspired place. You don't realize yet just how great you can be, just how good life can be.

<p>
	How many lifetimes of hell do you want to live through?
</p>

<p>
	Your soul desires to reunite with God. That's basically all it desires and it will not give you rest. Because it knows everything else is hogwash compared to God-realization.

<p>
	No, not always and never as deeply as during a trip. I'm sorta semi-lucid about it. Sometimes throughout the day I will reconnect and notice something like, "I am all alone" or "Hey! I'm God!"
</p>

<p>
	If I'm just going about everyday business it stays deep in the back of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	It's very much like sunlight through a cloudy sky. Occassional rays burst forth. The more you practice, the more you trip, the more rays burst forth on a regular basis.

<p>
	There may be very radical posibilities of incarnation. For example, imagine incarnating as a demi-god being who can architect his entire own universe of lesser beings and look after them like an ant farm. Imagine if you could split your consciousness into a million lesser beings and play through all of them at once.

</p>

<p>
	It stops when you reach total oneness in all possible ways. Total God. And then you being again from the bottom.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take any of this on faith. It could be wrong as far as you know. I'm just throwing out some ideas to open your mind. Direct experience is king.

The higher the teaching the more misunderstood it will be by the masses.

<p>
	I told you guys long ago that if you don't grow with me I will lose you in the dust. You can only see one or two stages ahead of you.
</p>

<p>
	By the time my work is done I will be seen as a madman and criminal. Then after I die I will be worshipped.
</p>

<p>
	Such is how humans behave.

<p>

<p>
	I'm saying those people who agree with my teachings the most are devils.

<p>
	It's like with the most zealous Christians. They are not true Christians, they are Christians in name only, not in action.

<p>
	You can only expect so much from a celeb gossip show.
</p>

<p>
	True happiness is a very radical and counterintuitive thing. Most people are not interested in it.
</p>

<p>
	If either of those men understood what true happiness is, their careers would be over. So it's not in their interest to understand it.

<p>
	Guys, it's not complicated. The instructions are clearly laid out in the books. All you have to do it follow them and practice. Everything will fall into place with a bit of practice. When in doubt, re-read that part of the book.
</p>

<p>
	You should not be here asking how to find a chakra. It's clearly explained in the books. If you can't follow that instruction how will a forum post help you?

</p>

<p>
	A soul is an individuated unit of cosmic consciousness which holds data even if you as the body/mind disappear.
</p>

<p>
	All souls are still ultimately one so this doesn't contradict nonduality. It just means there are layers to reality you are not aware of yet.
</p>

<p>
	Don't hold your body as primary. Soul is primary, body is just a costume it wears.
</p>

<p>
	Think of yourself as a hydra creature. Each head is one lifetime. Any head can be lost and the creature still lives on.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really say anything new. Most of these things have been written in various arcane scriptures which no one bothers to read for over 5000 years.
</p>

<p>
	If you care to understand reality in its fullest there is no getting around reading at least 200 books. You're not really serious otherwise. Your curiosity is too weak. If you really cared, reading 200 books would be a small price to pay to understand the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, most people will never do it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the next best thing. But most people won't do that properly either.
</p>

<p>
	The reason is: you don't really want to know the truth. It's not comfortable or easy.
</p>

<p>
	You will do it gladly. With love. Don't think of it as being the same stuck on a loop. You can make new choices each incarnation. It's like playing a video game. Each playthrough is different. Life's not a movie, it's a video game!

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1329-shiva/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="1329" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1329-shiva/" rel="">@Shiva</a> Firstly, yes it is strange-loopy since everything is one and you are talking about yourself here. The self-reference problem cannot be avoided here.
</p>

<p>
	But also consider:
</p>

<p>
	God's will is to give you free will. So you are free to be a creator. God watches as you create just to see what you as human will create. God loves anything you create equally much. But at the same time God desires that you re-discover the highest joy in existence: the joy of being God! So it's a though God had a trillion children in order to give them all the greatest gift in the universe: to discover that they are all Gods!
</p>

<p>
	Do you see the sheer genius of the design? It's designed to maximize love! God's great gift to the world is himself! And the only way he could give you that gift is by making you unconscious. So your unconsciousness is actually the highest form of love because it allows you to appreciate the possibility of awakening. You can't awaken unless you're alseep. God had to do it this way because he is giving the gift to himself because there is no one outside himself who he could give a gift to.
</p>

<p>
	So you'd be missing the greatest gift. But only for a finite period of time. Eventually every child wakes up. God rigged the game so no one can fail.
</p>

<p>
	Even the worst person ends up in heaven. That is God's love.
</p>

<p>
	What greater gift could exist in the universe than an infinite number of beings awakening to the fact that they are God? What greater purpose could exist? The purpose is INFINITE!
</p>

<p>
	It took God total Selflessness, Love, Goodness, and Intellect to acheive this! He's not fucking around. He used his power in the most responsible way possible, thus creating the universe as you see it today. He used his power to create paradise! For all his children to discover that they have always been in an unlimited paradise!
</p>

<p>
	If you only knew the extent of God's love for you, it would kill you. Since this love is without any trace of self. And since you are God. At the very moment that you realized this total paradise, you would be so alone that you would have no one in the universe to share it with. So your very next idea would be to create some "others" to share it with. But the only way you could do that is by making them unconscious, since otherwise they would just be you.
</p>

<p>
	The greatest tragedy of God is that he is so great he cannot share his greatness with anyone but himself. So here we are.
</p>

<p>
	It tends to be ever-increasing. It doesn't make such sense for Albert Einstein to incarnate into a kangaroo. That would be a step down.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possibility that there are higher beings than humans that you can incarnate into after you've maxed out being human.

<p>
	Religion is not created by the mystic but by his unrealized, unpracticing followers.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about me, it's about you! What will you create? Will you be a devil? Or will you actualize Godliness?
</p>

<p>
	Of course ego will come in and corrupt my teachings -- and all teachings. It cannot be otherwise. Wherever there is truth there is devilry not far behind. The devil will never allow a mountain of truth to sit uncorrupted out in the open.

<p>
	You already have! You got bored with that and incarnated into a human. So here you are! And now you want to go back??? What's the rush? After you end all manifestation you will be bored and re-create your human self again a million times over. You'll keep doing this for infinity.
</p>

<p>
	The end of manifestation, beginning of manifestation, and the middle of manifestation are all ONE! There is nowhere to go because there is only one place in the whole universe: nowhere. And you're already there no matter where you are. Try as you might you cannot escape from yourself! Wherever you go, there you are!

<title>First Existential Trip Report - Reached Eternal Insanity - Please Help</title>

<p>
	Yeah, I've been there. Realizing God can be freaky. Realizing all humans are your own imagination can be quite freaky too.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is you need a solid theoretical foundation in nonduality to help make sense of this stuff. Otherwise you'll feel extra lost.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you study some nonduality books. See my book list for dozens of great ones. That's what helps me ground my trips the most.
</p>

<p>
	Of course everything you saw was true:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		You are God
	</li>
	<li>
		You are all alone
	</li>
	<li>
		All people are your own creation
	</li>
	<li>
		Society is a lie
	</li>
	<li>
		Reality is a lie
	</li>
	<li>
		There is nothing but hallucination, and it goes on forever
	</li>
	<li>
		There is no difference between sanity and insanity
	</li>
</ul>

<p>

<p>
	Haha! You've got it precisely backwards! What could be BETTER than an eternal hallucination? It's heartbreaking in the truest sense: it's so Good and Beautiful that the Love of it breaks your heart.
</p>

<p>
	Death by Truth. Death by Love.
</p>

<p>
	What you saw is just the tip of the iceberg. There just isn't any physical world. There is only whatever you (as God) choose to hallucinate. You're hallucinating this forum post right now. And it's great! How else could anything exist as anything other than a hallucination? You are me and I am you. The circle is complete.
</p>

<p>
	Your only problem is that you lack theoretical foundation to properly ground and interpret your realizations. And this was also your first time. The first few times are freaky, then you get used to it and enjoy it. Also what you're missing is the infinite Goodness and Love of God. Your ego as taken these insights into a negative direction. That is a distortion of the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	So give yourself some time to heal and integrate these insights. Then come back for more to really understand. You've only had a tiny glimpse so far. Not enough to fully understand what you saw. Many more trips are required.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is a radical thing. It's an acquired taste.
</p>

<p>
	YES! I've felt that insanity you hit upon. That's some freaky shit. Shows you the power of God's Infinite Mind. But also great after the fact! Sanity is overrated. <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can face these things. It's merely the Truth. And nothing could be more beautiful or lovely. Just understand that your ego-mind badly distorted what you saw. It corrupted the Truth with its own petty judgments. So your negative reactions are not truthful.
</p>

<p>
	You're right. It's way too much. It's Infinite!
</p>

</p>

<p>
	It could be helpful, but probably not enough by itself. You can't really shortcut the inquiry if you want to truly awaken.
</p>

<p>
	And telling yourself, "I am God" would only be effective if you had a few glimpses already of what God is. Otherwise you'll just be filling your mind with wrong ideas of God.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that you have to SEE in your direct experience that you are God/nothing. Believing it is not good enough.
</p>

How Will creates all of physical reality?
</p>

<p>
	Have you become conscious that you designed your physical body using your own Will? Can you look at your hands and see that you are designing them right this very moment?
</p>

<p>
	Will and Being are one. Try to get a hit on that.
</p>

<p>
	Have you got a hit on Infinite Intelligence? What is intelligence in its purest form? Notice that Infinite Intelligence is materializing every physical object.
</p>

<p>
	By what method does God create? By what method are you creating this world?
</p>

<p>
	Make sure that you take FULL OWNERSHIP of yourself as God! You are doing it all! Do not offload that responsibility elsewhere! This is very important! You must realize yourself as THE CREATOR. You are not merely a nobody. You are THE CREATOR!
</p>

<p>
	The world is your creation. There is nothing and no one outside of you who is creating it. Because ONENESS.

	If Elliot Hulse is using Trump as a role model for how to be a man, God help us all. Trump is not a man, he's a man-baby. Don't be that. Watch my video above.

<p>
	Your best bet would be RSD videos.

</p>

<p>
	Of course it isn't true in any absolute sense.
</p>

<p>
	But very practically, if you want to be a high value man, you gotta teach yourself to be a provider/boss/value-generator.
</p>

<p>
	Traditionally the man's role is to hunt and bring home the wild game. Not being able to do so will hit your self-esteem. Again, simply on a practical level. We're not talking about enlightenment here. Just advice for average guys, not woke masters.
</p>

<p>
	Teach yourself how to hunt. Not to please the woman or society but to empower yourself. Hunting feels good. Which is why males of our species play first person shooter games. Females don't play such games.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: Why shouldn't you be happy that your ex is having sex? She is experiencing love and joy. Your spiritual growth is to realize that by loving her for getting love, you actualize your own love. And thereby everyone loves everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate the power of this. Your job in this life is to love everything until it hurts. Practice generatimg love on her behalf.
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot feel love for those who are happy, that's a sign of how much growing up you've got to do.
</p>

<p>
	Love her and love yourself. Then from this loving place find a new girlfriend. Remember: You can love people without having sex with them or even seeing them.
</p>

<p>
	The key to love is that it is an unlimited resource. You don't need to hoard it or trade it or hold it back in reserve because your truest nature is Infinite Love!
</p>

<p>
	Think abundance, not scarcity.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is just a lack of love.

<p>
	To me it's not so rare because I've studied lots of various masters. They are all profound in their own ways. If you have not studied many others then Sadhguru will seem rare.
</p>

<p>
	But clearly Sadhguru is great.

<p>
	That's untrue.
</p>

<p>
	Don't assume it cannot be known. It can be known.
</p>

<p>
	Both are true: you can reincarnate and God has already experienced everything. This is not a contradiction.
</p>

<p>
	Whether you reincarnate and as what you reincarnate as will depend.

<p>
	Wisdom comes from connection to God, not academics. Academics are very disconnected, so their understanding is straight-jacketed.

<p>
	That's a very short limbo. Consider yourself lucky.
</p>

<p>
	I get what you mean though. Sometimes loneliness can strike out of the blue.

<p>
	I've rendered & uploaded this video 3 times now. Each time it fails to process.
</p>

<p>
	Each render & upload takes about 12 hours.

<p>
	Youtube is definitely broken. I'm finding it impossible to upload videos. Every upload succeeds on my end but fails to process on their end.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I basically cannot upload videos any more unless they fix this.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't seem that they are even aware of the problem yet.

	I already uploaded it but YT failed to process it again. Something is off on their end.
