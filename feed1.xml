			It doesn't make sense to me - for society to, at one side of the coin feel that poor people are a financial imposition, and then at the same time, use whatever methods they can to keep these people from moving forward.  Essentially, the way this society is run is attempting to use various methods to murder the poor, disabled, diseased, minorities.  That is what the subtext says.  That pisses me off.<br />
			The majority of people who understand that subtext, are going to find that <em>repugnant</em>.  <br />

<p>
	What I was trying to communicate to you, and what you still refuse to see, is that all of this is still self-survival.
</p>

<p>
	Self-survival is a much bigger and more sophisticated notion than simply putting food in your belly. Your entire worldview is part of your "self" and what must survive. This of course includes all your notions of fairness, justice, morality, good/bad, social justice, good government, equality, and so on.

<p>
	You are being a child. We are just doing the work here. Don't make this personal.
</p>

<p>
	Important lessons are being taught to you right here which you still have yet to understand.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most common problems I see with my students is that they learn a bit from me and then all the sudden they think they have all of life figured out and that now they know better then everyone, including me. This is self-deception 101. You have many years of learning left before you understand how deep all of this really goes. So far you have only licked the surface of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that no one is personally attacking you here. All that's being pointed out is your survival patterns.
</p>

<p>
	What I was doing what robbing you of your justifications for your political position. Because all justifications are biased fabrications of the ego-mind. That is the lesson here.
</p>

<p>
	Realize that all justification are bullshit. They are not true in any objective sense. Justifications are manipulations of the mind. This can be painful lesson to learn, but well worth it.

<p>
	The name of your channel is irrelevant to its popularity.
</p>

<p>
	Achieving popularity is a lot harder than finding a popular name. It's about creating the right kind of content and marketing it in the right ways to the right people.
</p>

<p>
	If you get those 3 things right you could name your channel HairyMonkeyBallz and it would do great.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful naming things using your full real name because everything you put out will be permanently tied to you forever. It's very easy to screw up your reputation forever.
</p>

<p>
	That is more survival.
</p>

<p>
	You are doing survival.
</p>

<p>
	That's fine. But our work here is to become conscious of how survival biases our view of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take it personally.
</p>

<p>
	I pointed out your survival to you and you took offense (which is a doubling down on survival). Totally understandable. But it has nothing to do with truth.
</p>

<p>
	It's impossible to transcend survival if you get offended about your survival being pointed out to you.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be conscious politics without awareness of one's survival biases. What your post did was unconscious politics.
</p>

<p>
	Please don't make this about me. I am irrelevant.

	If it is a miligram scale, then yes. Assuming you know how to use it properly.

	You definely need to use a scale to calibrate your microscoops. You have no clear idea how much you actually took. Your numbers could be way off.

<p>
	You cannot atomize these things. They are deeply interconnected.
</p>

<p>
	That is the chief delusion men have, they want to treat sex and relationships as indepedent variables where for women it is not like that.
</p>

<p>
	You can have some quick sex and run off. She has to worry about dealing with a pregnancy. But of course you don't care about that risk as much as her.
</p>

<p>
	Sex for men and women is not symmetrical as men assume.

It's curiosity and the love of exploration. And nothing is lost if you can have more origami paper or if you play with another toy. The options are endless, and I want to explore everything there is. That's one perspective I can think of.

		<p>
			And another perspective being, if i knew the baby for what it is, i would not be able to do it, i would cry. I would comfort the little creature. I would not run the blade through it. Such a beautiful thing. Now if i were to run the blade through her despite knowing it's a baby, then i would be aware that doing so, would reveal that the baby wasn't the baby in the first place, that after it is shred into pieces, there is no baby. The sounds and the cries were emerging out of something which was not the body which was shred, but that which remains an unsolved mystery.

<p>
	Well, you are mixing survival issues with God-realization, which is a bit unfair. You are too wise for your own good! But not wise enough not to hang yourself with your knowledge of enlightenment. So you are stuck in a sort of netherzone.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimate fulfillment is too big of a thing for you to worry about right now. I would leave some room open for enjoying basic survival and getting good at that. It won't all be for waste. It's all part of your growth.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to feed and cloth yourself before you go chasing dreams of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	You are right that whatever you do, life is about enjoying the journey, not the destination. This applies to earning a billion dollars as well as to spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	It's too easy to pursue spiritual work joylessly.
</p>

<p>
	And don't forget: before enlightenment, the laundry. After enlightenment, the laundry. So you might as well get good at laundry.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need a book. Go experience some suffering.
</p>

<p>
	To clarify, your suffering must be mindful to dissolve ego. Mindless suffering can actually increase ego.
</p>

<p>
	Go do a 30 day solo retreat. You will learn suffering.

<p>
	Well, that's clearly a very unresourceful mindset.
</p>

<p>
	Do you want to spend your whole life thinking like that? Are you happy with the results that mindset brings you?
</p>

<p>
	If not, what results do you want and what mindset would create them?
</p>

<p>
	Do you see how your current mindset create a self-fulfilling prophecy? The thing you fear you end up creating by fearing it.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it can. Like heroin or eating too much food.
</p>

<p>
	But if you're disciplined, you can put that money to good use rather than allowing it to make you lazy and indulgent.
</p>

<p>
	You're never gonna be sick of simply have lots of digits in your bank account. The problem comes in what those digits drive you to do, or not do, and what you're sacrificing to get those digits in the first place. If you have a lot of digits and it doesn't corrupt you, no problem.

<p>
	Of course it depends on what kind of biz you're trying to make. If you're starting a new car company you might need $5 billion.
</p>

<p>
	But I started my first online biz for $2000-$4000.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't know where you'll get a mortgage these days with 5-10% down. Those days are long gone. 20% is standard these days. And that mortgage will cost you an opening fee and 3-5% per year. You gonna make all that back from your dinky condo? Don't forget, a condo has expenses, utilities, property taxes, and association fees.
</p>

<p>
	I would either save that money for a rainy day or invest some of it into building your skills so you can get a better job or start your own biz.
</p>

<p>
	The best investment of money is in training.
</p>

<p>
	But also you should have at least $10k-20k in saving just for emergencies and wiggle room. Don't be spending all your money. You need the wiggle room to change jobs, move cities, get needed healthcare, etc.
</p>

	A lot of it dissolved on its own. And I handed it over to my brother to manage so I could be free of it.

	It's very hard to leave a successful business that brings in lots of money. Very hard. It's like quitting heroin or the mafia.

<p>
	Mankind has existed for 350,000 years and rape is still a thing. So apparently it's not so easy. Rape will outlive your human form by many centuries. But even if you eliminate all rape in the future you will still be in a position where you must deny, reject, and demonize your past.
</p>

<p>
	God does not exist only in the future. God exists at all times and places. So God does not have the option to ignore the past. It must accept itself at all times and places. Only a human has the luxury of holding a perspective which accounts for a time span of 100 years. God's perspective must be infinite.

<p>
	Judgment, ego, shadow, and lack of compassion all go hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
	The less developed one's sense of self is, the lower one is on the Spiral, the more one judges, the less compassion one has, the larger one's shadow is, the more one must fight, deny, project, distract, distort, demonize, crusade, and justify.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is the most direct path to compassion for others who suffer. Suffering is the ego dissolving. Suffering leads to love.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple: any teaching which teaches judgment and fear instead of love is false.
</p>

<p>
	The degree to which your teacher is afraid of anything, he is corrupt.

</p>

<p>
	But if you choose to be devil, as you have done for now, then why are you puzzled about the existence of rapist devils? They just made the same choice you did. How can you expect the rapist to stop being a devil when you refuse to surrender your devilry? Surely it's easier for you than for him. And yet still you refuse.
</p>

<p>
	You are the hatred you project out onto others.

<p>
	That is the paradox of life. All meaning is imaginary, so what kind of meaning do you want to imagine? If you don't imagine consciously, you will imagine unconsciously. Not imagining is not an option. You are going to imagine something. You are going to create something. So what do you want to create?
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose and detachment are not opposites, they go hand in hand.

<p>
	All of that is still duality.

<p>
	Awaken to nonduality. Awaken to the fact of Infinite Love. Trust me on this one. You are only fighting yourself. Have the courage and wisdom to transcend all judgment, hatred, and fighting. It will be worth it. That is my highest teaching.

This problem goes much deeper. Even if you eliminated all the "evil" in the universe you would still not solve the problem because you would then be afraid and attached to there never appearing any new evil in the future. Hence you would fundamentally be rejecting your own infinite nature. You would be scared of yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The radical existential point is: God must love itself so completely that it accepts and allows all evil.
</p>

<p>
	That's the paradox: If God did not allow for all evil, God would be a devil. Which is what you currently are <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	The only barrier between you and God is your lack of self-acceptance. God's self-acceptance is total and absolute, since it is ALL. It takes a neurotic, limited intellect to reject itself. God is incapable of rejecting itself because it is the entire universe and it has infinite intellect.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to evil is not to stop it, it is to accept yourself fully. To accept yourself full is the end of evil. Evil is not a material fact, it is a matter of selfish perception.
</p>

So God created the entire universe, but not child rapists? So where did the child rapist come from? Did he create himself? If he did, then he is God. If he didn't, he was created by God. Either way, he is God.
</p>

<p>
	You are unable to see the love because you are too busy judging it.
</p>

<p>
	The devil is your judging mind. But you do not want to accept this. It is too threatening. It opens up a slippery slope where you might have to love everything unconditionally. And that is the last thing you want because your survival depends on you judging death to be bad.
</p>

<p>
	You are not indifferent, you are deeply judgmental. If I murdered your mother, you would judge me as a bad person. You would not be strong enough to love me.
</p>

<p>
	See, love is a very radical thing. An ego cannot do it.
</p>

<p>
	Fortunately God has no such limitations because God is totally selfless.
</p>

<p>
	If the universe rejected brutality, it would not be infinitely loving. God must accept itself totally, without exception.
</p>

<p>
	Careful... this is incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	Thoughts are distinct from feelings. You can have a thought without a feeling and a feeling without a thought.
</p>

<p>
	Thought is also possible without language. Thought can be in the form of images.
</p>

<p>
	You are on the right track, but this stuff is more nuanced than you think.
</p>

<p>
	Of course language is used to divide up reality into categories, all categories are dualities, and then those categories are reified or made "objective" through the creation of these categories, and then language is used to construct meaning. And all of this is ultimately imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	That's a classic conservative way of reasoning. From the conservative POV, people with problems are screw-ups because they didn't work hard enough, weren't disciplined enough, and therefore deserve it. Conservatives have an allergy to compassion because they build an ego out of being morally superior to poor people, drug addicts, criminals, minorities, women, disabled people, diseased people, foreigners, animals, etc.
</p>

<p>
	But life has a way of knocking such people off their pedestals. JP's view of transgender people would change significantly if he had a transgender son or daughter. For example.
</p>

<p>
	That's how self-bias distorts one's perception of reality.

</p>

<p>
	"Shock and awe" is a good way to describe certain deep existential insights. But that's usually upon first glimpses. Once you have many awakenings the terror of it goes away and you're mostly just left with awe.

<p>
	Die a few dozen times and you'll become comfortable with it. No big deal. It will be like, "Oh yeah... ego death. Cool."

<p>
	The problem with the creators of SD is that they do not have a deep access of God-consciousness. So they hit a glass-ceiling around the Yellow-Turquoise stage. The scientific mind cannot reach beyond Turquoise, yet that's when things start to get most interesting.

<p>
	If you want to really understand SD you will have to eventually abandon SD.

	Why do anything since eventually you'll be dead?

	Reality has no point other than being.

	No matter what you do, it doesn't matter other than in your imagination. A thing matters if you think it does.

<p>
	You have total freedom to do whatever you want since nothing you do matters.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, though, you are not in control of your desires. Your desires control you and dictate what you find meaningful. Of course your desires are totally selfish and groundless in the end. And your desires create your suffering.

<p>
	If you understood how I knew, you'd have already finished the inquiry and be awake.
</p>

<p>
	Hint: You will never find anything more fundamental than direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Any logic you conjure up to undermine direct experience is itself direct experience. This turns out to the key that unlocks Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Your speculations about aliens and computer simulations is all less fundamental than direct experience. The more you theorize and speculate, the further you get from Truth.

<title>Should I buy an existing business?</title>

<p>
	In practice it's hard to buy a decent existing business. People who are usually selling a business are doing it because the business is going downhill.
</p>

<p>
	$10k is so little when it comes to investing.
</p>

<p>
	It's pointless to buy a business you have zero experience with. You'll tank it. Running a business requires keen industry knowledge and experience. It makes sense to buy competitors in a field you're already deeply experienced in. But that's gonna cost you a lot more than $10k.
</p>

<p>
	What condo you gonna buy with $10k?
</p>

<p>
	$10k is basically good enough to start a small biz of your own. But this will require full time work.
</p>

<title>Complete Financial Freedom Before Life Purpose</title>

But it was very painful and soul-crushing.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, once you have a bunch of money and success from a non-purpose business, you will become so attached to it that you are not likely to ever find your true purpose. You will get comfortable and lazy and finding your LP will become too risky and inconvenient.
</p>

<p>
	Money and success easily corrupts the mind, getting it to justify whatever brings in that money as "good". You will start telling yourself things like, "Well, what if this thing I'm doing is already my LP? It probably is. Why rock the boat?"
</p>

<p>
	The enemy of the great is the good.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, you could easily lose all your money before you reach some kind of level of total security and freedom. Chasing money does not guarantee you money. The point of aligning with your LP is that it gives you the super-human passion necessary to become successful. It's hard to become successful at something your heart isn't into.
</p>

	Again, you're still thinking about this using your dick.

<p>
	The biggest challenge girls face is that they get pumped and dumped.

<p>
	It's easy for a girl to get laid. The hard part is getting a quality guy to commit to her.

<p>
	Imagine how you'd feel is every time you met a cool guy, he fucked you and left to pursue hotter girls.

<title>Would the world be a better place if it was more Psychedelic?</title>

<p>
	In practice every technology gets abused by devils.
</p>

<p>
	Since more than 50% of the world population is stage Blue or below, psychedelics would not work worldwide. But they can work in the most advanced cities and countries with proper regulation and education. The educational component is crucial. Something like Actualized.org is needed to create a theoretical framework for existential inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	Giving random people psychedelics is bound to create some disastrous situations which prompt regulators to crack down on it. Just like happened in the 60's. People were doing psychedelics without any proper theoretical framework. This framework still largely does not exist. One of my goals is to create that framework.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's worth pushing society to embrace psychedelics. There will be some minor disasters along the way but it will be worth it in the end. This movement is really no different than pushing for the abolition of slavery. Similar hurdles will be faced. What we're talking about here is changing deep cultural paradigms. The deeper the paradigm, the harder it will be to change, the more you will demonized for trying to change it.
</p>

<p>
	But it will happen regardless. It's only a question of time.
</p>

<p>
	That is the whole problem in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
	You can still practice dropping stuff. Including dropping intellectualization.
</p>

<p>
	Letting go must be practiced 1000s of times. It's nowhere near enough to let go a few dozen times. This must be a daily practice for years.
</p>

<p>
	See Sedona Method. It's worth doing.

</p>

<p>
	Take a conceptual thing and let it go in your direct experience. That is letting go.
</p>

<p>
	For example, let go of the idea that the Earth is round. Do it right now. That's it! That's letting go.
</p>

<p>
	Your ideas of letting go are not letting go.
</p>

<p>
	Try letting of the idea that the Earth is round until you no longer have any attachment to it. To the point where it no longer bothers you. To the point where it's just a non-issue.

Its difficult in a metaphysical context. But ive become extremely carefull and less heated in conversations about politics and generall life and morality questions. I cannot argue with my parents about refugee politics here in germany because they are just so stuck up in their way and they dont seem to notice. They do not have a sense where hate can lead and how twisted our motivations amd emotions are. They see me as a kind of left wing sheep who is just weak and not decisive. They do not see any complexity in such issues, while for me its difficult to utter any stupid phrase like they do, and then call it decisive or "experienced"

<p>
	Good! That's just the tip of the iceberg.
</p>

<p>
	When you fully understand relativity you should be unable to speak. Any statement you make about reality is a relative lie.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute cannot be spoken or thought.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is totally groundless and infinite. You cannot pin down infinity no more than a hand can grasp itself.
</p>

<p>
	The only solution is total acceptance of direct experience precisely how it is and not how you wish it to be.
</p>

<p>
	The more fully you accept reality, the more under-developed people will think you are crazy and criminal. It is of course because they are under-developed precisely because they reject so much of reality in order to suit their survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	The deeper your love becomes, the more unconscious people will hate you. An ego cannot tolerate unconditional love.
</p>

<p>
	This is the fundamental challenge of God-realization. You know what happened to Jesus. If it was easy, everyone would be Jesus, but virtually no one is. Now you can appreciate why.

<p>
	You need to study attraction theory and then tons of practice in real life to iron out your socially awkward ways.
</p>

<p>
	Basically your problem is you have way too little socialization experience so you don't understand all the subtle social cues and norms of courtship.

<p>
	Because there is no clear way of measuring the depth of various awakenings. Each one feels absolute.
</p>

<p>
	There's basically no way to know you're missing something unless you stumble upon an even deeper realization.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost impossible for human beings to reach the highest levels of consciousness without chemical modification. And most humans are against chemical modification. So they have no idea what they are missing.

Perhaps one can have an opinion that the absolute is far too tricky to give it a name because it will inevitably create a duality. When we talk about god we do it from a lense of a christian backround because when we grew up we saw around us the christian symbolic representation of god and now the word god rings the bell of that imagery. I say this because calling the absolute a god encompasses a lot of aspects of the absute BUT perhaps some aspects of the absolute are better represented in different forms especially if you want to explore different dimentions of life. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Everybody needs their own set of concepts because of their biology, culture and life endeavours. If we play the game of "my thing is better than yours" we are forgetting how diverse the absolute can be.

	You are God. End of story.

	If you are not conscious that you are God, or what the word God means, you just aren't fully awake.
</p>

<p>
	God has nothing to do with Christians, religions, humans, langauge, symbols, or any of that. God is infinite consciousness. Find out for yourself. You are it.

<p>
	Ego = suffering
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is not optional for ego. It's how it keeps itself alive.
</p>

<p>
	So long as your identity is less than infinite, you will suffer because you are disconnected from Truth.
</p>

<p>
	False perception creates all suffering.

<p>
	I found the best way to do that is by starting in the bedroom, where even tomboyish girls want to feel girly.
</p>

<p>
	In the bedroom you can literally guide her to tap into pure femininity. And then maybe from there it will spill over a bit into normal life. But still, don't expect to change her too much.
</p>

<p>
	To be able to guide her properly you first need a deep personal understanding of what femininity is. Which means you need to first guide yourself to connect with your feminine side.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are very helpful here.
</p>

<p>
	Try to have an orgasm as a woman using your mind. Then you might understand what femininity is.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, if everything is one, femininity is a fundamental part of your being. All femininity was created by your mind. If you are a man, it is part of your shadow, an aspect of reality you have disowned so you could get it from "other".
</p>

<p>
	You have not fully awakened until you have reintegrated it.
</p>

<p>
	For this issue you'd be better off visualizing yourself having multiple orgasms.
</p>

<p>
	Women can have powerful orgasms simply through strong visualization with no physical stimulation.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate how powerful your mind is.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is no substitute for having the right partner.

</p>

<p>
	There will always be geo-political tensions. The deeper question is, should national economies be more fair and less skewed towards unchecked greed, wage slavery, and profit?
</p>

<p>
	Pretty obvious that a conscious economy would be more fairly distributed, with high taxes on massive and needless wealth.

			I tend to agree, and yet if I'm really honest, I don't know. No one can know. When you do your practices and awakening happens, to say the practices helped is just a belief. You can never ever know that. Even this belief is reinforcing the illusion of separation. It's infinitely tricky. I'm not saying don't do the practices. But to think it's possible to manipulate reality for it to realize what it already is IS EGO ITSELF. As long as you think you can understand or manipulate the Absolute, you distance yourself from it. And I see this trap being tapped in here again and again. And I see it in myself as well. Might be worth taking into account. Maybe this is one of the tricks you still can't surrender.

<p>
	There are many levels of growth. The highest levels cannot be reached while manipulating.
</p>

<p>
	Most people never encounter this limit because they never grow that high.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate why you manipulate. And then surrender your need to stay alive or the need to meet any of your desires. Imagine a life where you stop caring what happens to you. Now manipulation has become unneccessary.
