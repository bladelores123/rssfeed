	The levels are not discrete things. Think of it more like light. There are many degrees of light, from an LED to the sun and beyond.

<title>Is Time Fundamental?</title>

<p>
	Time is purely conceptual and imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	When you become conscious enough you can just stop imagining it. You can just forget it like you do an old childhood memory, until it pops back into your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Time is a conceptual projection of your mind. Don't confuse it with raw experience. Just because raw experience changes DOES NOT mean it happens in time. Change and time are not the same thing, even though we measure time by using change.
</p>

<p>
	Also be careful with thinking that reality occurs in frames or has a frame rate. It does not. There is one continuous field.
</p>

<title>Does Info Wars count as a cult?</title>

<p>
	Technically it is not a cult because it does not coerce you to be a member or prevent you from leaving.
</p>

<p>
	But effectively it is a cancer of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	The technical definition of what a cult is will have to be updated to account for this new online era we now live in, where physical coercion becomes less practical. The best kind of manipulation and corruption is not physically forceful.

<p>
	It's not false per se, it's conceptual, relative, and partial.
</p>

<p>
	There are multiple orders of reality which we can talk about. Be careful not to confuse them. Sensation is a 1st order thing. Causation is a 2nd order thing. Similar to how sand is a 1st order thing and sand castles are a 2nd order thing.
</p>

<p>
	In this inquiry we are only interested in 1st order things. So stop asking 2nd order questions.

			Yes, I mean that pain is caused by a bar (while doing squats) on my neck and while I was going up it moved something at my neck and since then I have this pain, hence me going to physio therapy, but until now no luck <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

		<p>
			Anyway, the reason why I'm telling you that is because the ego obviously wants it to be healed and obviously nobody can say if it will, but "I" have faith. However, if it is self caused and pain is pain, this pain on my neck caused the numbness in my right leg too, so somehow it is connected. By what? consciousness? Measurements such as physio therapy, what are they doing? Moving my consciousness to the right place again?

<p>
	There is only a field of sensations and whatever causal explanations you're holding in your mind are drawing relationships between these various sensations, trying to make sense of them. Your mind can draw an infinite number of causal relationships between an infinite number of different sensations.
</p>

<p>
	E.g., you get an itch on your ass and you connect it in your mind with an image of a mosquito. You are connecting sensations with other sensations and those connections are themselves sensations.
</p>

<p>
	You've got nothing but sensations of various qualities.
</p>

<p>
	These are complicated conceptual questions. Don't worry about that for now. You can explore those questions in a few months -- assuming they still remain -- once you've done some serious inquiry grounded in direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	The short answer is: everything is self-caused. The brain doesn't cause pain. Pain causes pain. Pain IS pain. Everything is itself. That's it. A = A.

<p>
	No. Fear of intimacy is not your problem.
</p>

<p>
	Your problem is a total lack of experience in dating. This is a very different problem, and actually easier to fix.
</p>

<p>
	Step 1: Stop playing victim and making excuses.
</p>

<p>
	Step 2: Watch some pickup videos about how to attract women.
</p>

<p>
	Step 3: GO OUT AND TALK TO GIRLS IN REAL LIFE EVERY WEEK!
</p>

<p>
	Step 4: Enjoy sex.
</p>

<p>
	Everything will auto-correct if you just keep going out regularly.

<p>
	No, I'm saying you are the first person who will come crying and asking for regulation as soon as your safety is threatened. You don't care about freedom. You care about your survival. "Freedom" is just a euphemism you invented for your selfishness. By preaching about freedom you are just blowing smoke up your own ass. You are terrified of true freedom. If true freedom was given to you, you would immediately reject it as you felt its gravity.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're yelling, "Give me heat! Give me heat!" so we bring you close a fire and you like it. So you yell, "This is good. Give me more heat! More heat!!!!" but we tell this is close enough. But you yell even louder, "Give me more heat!!!!!!" so we bring you right next to the fire and it burns you. Then you yell, "You bastards! Why did you burn me?!"
</p>

<p>
	Like a child, you have no idea the consequences of what you ask for.

	"Censorship" as you so sloppily call it, exists at all stages in various ways.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	All regulation, by definition, becomes political as people have different survival values and will disagree about which regulations are necessary or valid.
</p>

<p>
	Society will never not have regulation, and the regulation will always be grounded in some value set and worldview. There is no such thing as "without an agenda". You are complaining because it's not your agenda which being implemented. But any implementation of anything requires some agenda vs another.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Because Google, Facebook and Youtube are doing this, there is an asking for free-speech platforms. There are a few cropping up like Bitchute.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There will never be a mainstream non-toxic absolute "free speech" platform. The people who think Google, Facebook, and YT are violating their free speech are mostly trolls, cultists, fundamentalists, extremists, racists, homophobes, fascists, criminals, assholes, devils, and ignoramuses who cannot even understand the Constitution. So your "free speech" platform will aggregate the lowest scum on the internet and they will masturbate furiously together inside a toxic, self-reinforcing ideological echo-chamber without any adult supervision until some great evil precipitates, forcing law enforcement and the courts to shut it down. This is what happens on sites like 4chan. Although even 4chan has moderation and regulation, so it's not nearly as bad as it could be.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be any healthy social media site which goes unmoderated. This is clear as day if you have any experience running a forum. This is the whole reason that societies creates laws in the first place. If humans were responsible enough not to need laws, laws wouldn't exist. Every law is a restriction on freedom.

<p>
	You have to clarify in your experience what "a brain" is. What does the phrase "a brain" or "my brain" actually refer to in your direct experience? For example, the phrase "Santa Claus" refers to an image of a fat bearded guy in a red costume in your mind. How about "the brain"? You'll have to be very careful here not to get lost in layer upon layer of concept.
</p>

<p>
	If you think "my brain" refers to an actual physical object in your skull, think again! That is NOT true in your direct experience. That is a conceptual fabrication because there is no physical brain present in your direct experience. If you're honest, you've probably never seen a brain in your entire life. Which obviously means your entire notion of brains is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Now, of course, this is where your mind will get extra tricky. It will say, "Okay, but if we cut open my skull there is guaranteed to be a brain in there!" But now you need to carefully notice that this too is imaginary! You are imagining your skull cut open. This is not real in your direct experience. Now you will say, "But what if it becomes real?!" << But that too is imagination! The entire notion of a future is imaginary! <img alt=":o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy@2x.png 2x" title=":o" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	You see, imagination works in multiple interwoven layers in order to create a sense of objective reality which isn't really there other than in your mind. If your mind stopped working, objective reality would disappear.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take my word for it. Take a look at it. Is there anything about reality which is objective outside your imagining that it is? How is it possible that you have ever accessed anything objective at all when 100% of your experience of life has been subjective???!!! <img alt=":o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy@2x.png 2x" title=":o" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Notice that objectivity is just subjectivity denied.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Part of the challenge here is seeing the relativity of "healthy". You are in some sense applying a stage Green idea of "health" to stage Red. But stage Red survival happens in a very different environment than modern developed society. So even a warlord or a mobster is not necessarily unhealthy once you consider the environment they have been forced to survive in. It mostly becomes unhealthy when you put that warlord into a modern developed society.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, you don't blame a crocodile for being unhealthy when he snaps at an antelope.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's primitive and exploitative (by today's standards).
</p>

<p>
	An intellectually empty mind. A mind that doesn't feel a need to think.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of people go through life without thinking much about anything. They are like animals.

	It's real easy for a cat to meditate.

<p>
	Well... people's notion of life-transforming is of course highly subjective.
</p>

<p>
	Those who are well-suited to it will get a lot more juice out of it. Exponentially more. Like 100x more. So that can explain that.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I'm not well-suited to it. My mind is hyper creative non-stop.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation is best for people with weak minds <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />

	It's far more shocking than that.

<p>
	There is only one dream. Yours. You are dreaming all the other dreamers.

			the benefits of mediation have become a bit overblown, it's a power tool sure, but is it life transforming? Perhaps not.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The reason you feel that way is because for meditation to be life-transforming it must be done with extreme rigor.
</p>

<p>
	If you half-ass meditation, it is 100x weaker than if you do it rigorously.
</p>

<p>
	Most people in the West are not taught to do serious meditation. They are taught meditation for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	It took me a lot of trial and error just to learn this. And I'm by no means a great mediator. But I understand what makes it powerful or life-transforming.
</p>

<p>
	Also, not all people are equally suited for it.
</p>

<p>
	To really appreciate meditation it must be done as a hardcore monk, virtually full-time. But almost no one is willing to pay that cost.
</p>

<p>
	With consciousness work you get what you are willing to put into it.
</p>

			No opportunism is not an ideology at least it is not used in this context as far as I can see.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Maybe a better way to put it is that most ideology is deep down opportunistic because its core function is to serve survival.
</p>

<p>
	Have you not noticed how the most ideological and dogmatic people are also the most hypocritical, making all sorts of excuses and exceptions for their own behavior? Why is that? Is that merely an accident or is there some deep connection between the two?
</p>

<p>
	Ideology is never some pure thing. It is always corrupted by the needs of the one who holds it because if the one who holds it doesn't get his needs met, he dies, and so does the ideology. So the paradox is that even though the ideology pretends to be rigid and pure, actually it's flexible in just the right ways that allow for the host to get his needs met.
</p>

<p>
	For example, murder is bad, but not when it comes to slaughtering animals -- because the host who carries that belief has to eat.
</p>

			I don't believe that. I think oppurtunists play the game better than people who believe what they are doing because oppurtunists studied the rules of power, persuasion. They can adjust to situations. They can make money by being leftist and also by being neo conservative. <br />
			<br />
			Of course if you believe in something you have super powers. You don't get tired like others but you may not be able to implement it into real life.<br />

	All human knowledge works this way. First we over-simplify reality, then we discover that our over-simplifications aren't nuanced enough to deal with complex edge-cases like trans people. And so we have to re-evaluate our simplistic ideas. But lots of people are resistant to doing so because they have taken on those oversimplifications as "facts", and they get outraged when they find you denying their "facts".
</p>

<p>
	Point me to a fact in the world which says, "That is man, and that is woman." You will not find such a fact within biology.

			I hadn’t thought of that. . . I also think it’s harder to call out one of your own. When Warren accused Bernie of telling her “A woman couldn’t become president”, I felt a strong repulsive reaction to it and was like “Bernie would never say that”. I took effort to step back and be open to the possibility that Bernie did say it.

<p>
	The real test for progressives is if someone like Bernie wins the presidency and then starts doing evil things. Will progressives have enough integrity and impartiality to call him out on it? Many won't because they will justify it in their minds as, "Well, he's still better than any neoliberal."
</p>

<p>
	That's exactly what Republicans do with Trump.

<p>
	Yes, but that is also easy for them to do now because they are not in a position of power yet. It serves the progressive survival agenda to rip apart neoliberals because the neoliberals are in power. But once progressives get into positions of power they will start to use double-standards to excuse away their selfish behaviors.

<p>
	The real test of your integrity is when you have serious power. It's easy to act noble and righteous when you are powerless.

			It seems conservatives do this more often, yet democrats are not immune. When Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault, the democrats were all in supporting Blasey-Ford and how she should be believed.

<p>
	Of course. This is what I refer to as self-bias, where one's own position is held as privileged and sacrosanct.
</p>

<p>
	The lower down the Spiral, the more self-bias there is.
</p>

<p>
	The mind uses double-standards, confirmation bias, projection, denial, and justification to enforce its self-bias.

			Could one way of doing this be to think “I’m defending solid, good, American conservative values and I need to be agile to respond against crazy and evil communists”. . . That way if they come in on Wednesday and the narrative completely changes, they can rationalize it as “adapting” their strategy against the crazy and evil communists.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course!
</p>

<p>
	Once the mind paints some situation as evil and another as good, virtually any action can be justified in the avoidance of that evil situation because it's seen to be in the service of good -- which can't be wrong (by the mind's logic).
</p>

<p>
	For example, if the mind believes that it is on God's side, almost any action is justified in the service of God. And you better believe all those FoxNews people believe they are doing God's work.
</p>

<p>
	Since they see the communists are taking more and more radical actions and gaining ground, they feel more justified to take off the kid gloves and use every trick in the book to win.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I disagree with Kyle on this. Trump is fundamentally more dangerous than Bush, even though Bush might have caused more lives lost strictly-speaking with Iraq. You have to distinguish between potential damage and actualized damage. You don't know how bad Trump could get if he gets 4 more years. A nuclear war is on the table. And when we take a look at the slow Covid response, hundreds of thousands of deaths could be on Trump's hands. A war with Iran is still on the table, which could be worse than Iraq.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously Bush was a dangerously ignorant leader. But Trump is more ignorant and more dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously I have not interest in whitewashing Bush's presidency. It was a disaster on many levels, both internationally and domestically. I was extremely critical of Bush during that era.

<p>
	Don't underestimate the mind's ability to fool itself into believing whatever serves its survival. Self-deception covers its own tracks. They are not aware of their own hypocrisy because then they couldn't live with themselves. From their POV they are defending solid, good, American conservative values against crazy and evil communists who seek to destroy America. They see themselves as heroes and guardians of mankind. This justifies all of their flip-flopping and manipulations.

<p>
	My point is that such a question is not as easy to answer as people assume.
</p>

<p>
	The mind deliberately conflates its worldview and its survival agenda to the point where it's hard to distinguish what is authentic and what is an act.
</p>

<p>
	I would bet that he believes that Democrats are far more corrupt and dangerous than Trump, which renders the question of Trump's misdeeds and corruption moot in his mind, similar to how we might overlook Biden's problems because we see Trump as the greater evil.
</p>

<p>
	He cares about elites abusing their power to the extent that it serves his worldview and career.

	So what's missing from that analysis is that Tucker is still operating under a worldview and an ideology.
</p>

<p>
	His mind -- like all minds -- tailors his worldview to fit his survival needs, and vice versa.

	Believe it or not, even with everything said in the above video, he's still acting in good faith, in a deeper sense. His worldview is one in which his actions are fully justified, reasonable, true, and good.
</p>

<p>
	Of course his ideology conveniently aligns with what is good for his career.

	History is full of people attempting to suppress the sex drive. The track record doesn't look good.
</p>

<p>
	I prefer to indulge in it with moderation and love.

</p>

<p>
	Most of my life I've been too busy for sex because I was so focused on my LP. If you lead a lame, boring, passionless life, then yeah -- masturbation is like all you got going for you.
</p>

<p>
	Usually, the less creative I am, the more my mind wanders towards sex. When I'm most creative, sex disappears into the background.

	Is here against peaceful protest? I don't think so. He's more complaining about extremist elements from what I remember.

<p>
	It's a deep topic. You'd have to start defining what you mean by critical theory and give concrete examples of it. Some of it will be reasonable, some of it will be excessive.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental thing that's not understood by Bret and JP is relativism. There are no objective facts per se. Reality is relative and constructed by the mind.
</p>

<p>
	If there is no such thing as absolute time, as Einstein showed, there surely is no such thing as absolute male or female. It's pretty embarrassing how a hard scientist like Bret can accept General Relativity but then insist that males and females are objective biological facts.

	The mistake there is taking universities too seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Be an independent thinker. Nothing is stopping you from taking whatever combination of classes you want.

<p>
	Be careful not to get caught up in petty social squabbles. Focus on creating your life as you want it.

<p>
	Which events?
</p>

<p>
	If you mean some of the deplatforming events on college campuses, like what happened to Bret in his classroom, yes, I think that is excessive and problematic. Stage Green can get excessively SJW-ey. But this is an exception and shouldn't cause too much alarm. Bret thinks it will cause a societal collapse, which is silly. That is just fearmongering.
</p>

<p>
	Bret wants progressive reforms, but he's unwilling to pay the cost in terms of social and cultural upheaval that will be necessary to bring it about.

<p>
	I watched the entire interview last week.
</p>

<p>
	Overall he's a reasonable guy. More reasonable than JP. I actually agree with most of his analysis of the George Floyd case.
</p>

<p>
	But of course he's not properly understanding the "cultural marxist" phenomena on college campuses. He sees it as a dangerous force that will destroy democracy. This is the same mistake JP makes. He's conflating stage Green with Maoism. He doesn't understand that stage Green has many healthy versions which are more evolved than the status quo. Of course Green has its excesses, but he's overly focused on that because he personally suffered from it. That's understandable, but it is skewing his perspective of where society is headed. Stage Green is not the end of democracy, it will lead to better democracy. He's failing to distinguish between health and unhealthy version of Green.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, Bret's a decent guy. He simply doesn't have a high enough perspective on things. He's still stuck in materialism, which is why he can't fully understand stuff like critical theory and its post-modernist roots. This is clear when he says that scientifically, male and female are some biological objective fact. This is obviously false if you have a deep understanding of epistemology and metaphysics. But he doesn't have that understanding because he's operating on materialism and realism. He doesn't understand how "male" and "female" could be categories projected by his own mind. He takes this the metaphysics for granted, as most STEM people do.
</p>

<p>
	And Joe Rogan does not have enough intellectual chops to challenge him on these points. Which is part of the problem when Joe interviews serious people on serious topics. He's not able to properly challenge their points. He mostly just ends up agreeing with whatever they say, and by extension so does his audience. Virtually nobody in Joe's audience will be able to deeply question Weinstein's view post-modernism. Post-modernism is really challenging to understand.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, he does it in good faith. He's a true believer in his own ideology.
</p>

<p>
	He simply has a different worldview than you. If it seems that he's acting in bad faith, it's because you don't appreciate the difference in worldview because you are looking at the situation from your own worldview.
</p>

<p>
	You're missing the relativity of all worldviews. Your worldview is not "true", it's a projection of your own mind and its survival concerns. Same as Tucker.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to grow, drop your worldview and try to look at the world from Tucker's POV until you understand its appeal.
</p>

<p>
	This is your error.
</p>

<p>
	You need a way to satisfy yourself sexually because you cannot always have the stars aligned with another person, even if you are in a relationship or married. Many times they will simply be physically unavailable.
</p>

<p>
	You need to realize that there is no difference whatsoever between having sex with another person and having sex with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	A sexual fantasy is as real as "real" physical sex.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, your sex will become much more potent and satisfying once you embrace the imaginary, purely mental aspects of sex.
</p>

<p>
	Don't buy into the societal norms and judgments which gives a negative connotation of fantasy or imaginary sex.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you have sex with someone physically, that desire will still probably not get satisfied or go away. It will only be a temporary satisfaction which will turn into a new craving in a few days. So it's not that much different than masturbation.
</p>

<p>
	A true sage has sex using the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than suppressing your need desires, embrace them and allow yourself to have the love you crave. You will overcome craving more effectively through love than through denial.
</p>

<p>
	Own your sexuality.
</p>

			So, I sit there for 25 minutes and ask the following: 
		</p>

		<p>
			- who am I? <br />
			- you are the brain, of course<br />
			- how do I know that? <br />
			- well, everything you do, comes from the brain<br />
			- but RIGHT NOW, who am I? <br />
			- you are aware of your sensations and your thoughts...isn't that your brain?<br />
			- why should it be the brain? <br />
			- because it is scientific proven<br />
			- your DIRECT EXPERIENCE...RIGHT NOW...who are you? <br />
			- someone is always watching my thoughts, which doesn't speak and doesn't do anything...am I the awareness? <br />
			- could it be? <br />
			- but then who comes up with these thoughts? <br />
			- they come up out of nowhere...so is this nowhere you? <br />
			- you cannot only be the awareness cause else who is doing the actions? coming up with thoughts? who decides things? <br />
			- me<br />
			- who is this me? it can't be you because you are a thought and you are definitely not a thought<br />
			- its nothing? 
		</p>

		<p>
			That's where I'm currently stuck at. These thoughts they arrive out of nowhere. So, is this nowhere and nothing that is deciding everything? My thoughts, actions, including the awareness? 
		</p>

		<p>
			Right now when I'm typing all of this, who decided this? It's not the thought, but it's the one BEFORE the thought, which is located nowhere. Am I right? Am I on the right track?

<p>
	Yes, that is a good start.
</p>

<p>
	Get very simple and direct with it.
</p>

<p>
	Try this next time you sit down for 25 mins: Take your finger and try to point to yourself. Notice carefully what the finger it pointing at. Try to clarify what that thing is. Notice, the finger never points at a brain. What is seeing the finger?
</p>

<p>
	As you do this, try to minimize thinking. Don't think about it, look at it. Clearly, thoughts come and go, so they cannot be essential to what you are. What is essentially you?

<p>
	No, it's not that simple. It's just one brute force method that tends to work well for clubbing.
</p>

<p>
	It does not necessarily address the root issue of your anxiety. But you gotta start somewhere. Sometimes problems auto-correct simply through exposure and practice. If you've been living in your mother's basement, going  out to lots of clubs and socializing will auto-correct much of your social awkwardness, since most of it simply comes from inexperience. Practice builds competence and confidence.

<p>
	You can still patiently make your case and offer Yellow explanations. Most people are not extreme lefties or righties and they will listen to a well-reasoned Yellow explanation. In fact, that should appeal to many people who are in the middle and don't like both extremes, since Yellow tends to be more balanced.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to remember that these political pundits on YT tend to be extremists on either side. They are too invested in the material they cover. Average people are not nearly so invested and are more persuadable.
</p>

<p>
	That's mostly my function here. The beauty of Yellow is that it tends to be unbiased and reasonable.

<p>
	What are you smoking? He said it a bunch of times in his Krystal and Sagaar video. He calls Sagaar and Tucker Carlson a white nationalist fascist and he even basically calls Krystal Ball that. He's way out of line there.
</p>

<p>
	Sagaar is not a fascist or a white nationalist. And as much as I hate Tucker, he's not a fascist either.
</p>

<p>
	Just because someone isn't a raving progressive does not make them a fascist or a fascist sympathizer.
</p>

<p>
	Vaush is an intelligent guy but he's too blinded by his progressivism. I know his heart in the right place but he lacks important nuance and understanding of conservatives.
</p>

<p>
	Sagaar is a decent and reasonable conservative.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with demonizing someone like Sagaar is that if you can't make peace with Sagaar's brand of conservatism, you basically can't negotiate or respect any conservative at all. As progressives it's very important that we accommodate reasonable conservatives, otherwise they will become radicalized.
</p>

<p>
	Politics requires compromise. You can't exclude and demonize 40%-50% of the population. That's going to backfire on you. You cannot expect every conservative in the country to convert to liberalism. It ain't ever gonna happen. Conservatives need to have a say in the direction of the country because that's how democracy works. Compromising with someone like Sagaar on immigration is actually a good deal. It will pacify conservative fears and lessen their radicalization. Sagaar's immigration stance is not a racist one. Unchecked immigration should not be the progressive position. It will turn off 50% of the country.
</p>

<p>
	Vaush is far too uncharitable to Sagaar.
</p>

<p>
	They are both dangerous in their unique ways. No need to turn this into a contest.
</p>

<p>
	I would actually say Trump is worse simply because he's at a lower stage of the Spiral. But then again, Trump is also so incompetent that he's not as bad as he would otherwise be.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, Bolton might start a war with Iran. But he would not, for example, ask foreign nations to interfere with American elections or refuse to leave office if he lost an election.
</p>

<p>
	Bolton has more integrity than Trump, which is a crucial factor. Without integrity you have a monster on your hands.

	We've talked about it in the past.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with these books is that for you it is all hearsay. Unless you can directly experience it, it isn't true for you.
</p>

<p>
	Be very careful simply accepting plausible spiritual narratives. Adopting a spiritual narrative is not going to grow your consciousness.

<p>
	The point of Absolute Consciousness is that it is crystal clear and Absolute. There cannot be fooling at that level. Fooling is a relative feature of a finite mind.

<p>
	You are so blinded by the hatred of them that you fail to see that without mainstream media democracy would devolve into authoritarianism and rank corruption the likes of which you cannot even imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Mainstream media is what protects against Trump becoming a full on tyrant. You just take this function for granted. Most nations can only dream of having America's freedom of press and quality journalism.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's bashing of the mainstream media is precisely designed to undermine it so that he can be a lying tyrant. This is so fucking obvious, yet you're falling for it. In your eagerness to avoid the string of a bee you are jumping into the jaws of a crocodile.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's attacks on the press is one of the most evil things that he's done. And it has long-term consequences beyond his time in office.
</p>

<p>
	Dude, the government is not that involved in people's lives. The government is not in control of when a mother decides to leave her husband for whatever reason because she has more freedom than ever in history. Same for the father. These are private decisions.
</p>

<p>
	One of the consequences of greater democracy is greater freedom, which means that people do whatever they feel like, even if it's problematic. The government cannot force couples to stay together.
</p>

<p>
	In the past, strong marriage was a survival necessity. That is no longer the case. And that will not change back, so you're fighting a war you cannot win.

<p>
	You are demonizing points of view without being openminded or curious enough about really exploring them and seeing the world from different perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	Your understanding of the motivations and intention of the mainstream media is incorrect -- warped by the biases of your worldview. I suggest you muster the courage to drop your worldview and consider other POV in good faith, rather than judging them. Your judgment clouds your ability to be neutral and open enough to see a new perspective.
</p>

<p>
	This is not an issue of who's wrong or right, good or bad, left or right. It is a meta-issue of your mind getting paradigm locked. Notice that you have some personal axe to grind against the mainstream media. This is driven by your survival agenda. Which means you are unable to seriously see their POV. Which hinders the development of your consciousness and ability to love. You are shooting yourself in the foot.
</p>

<p>
	Try not to make this stuff personal.
</p>

	You'll have to watch some of the videos 10 times to squeeze out all the juice. And even decades later you'll still be finding new nuggets of insight. That's just the nature of this work.

<p>
	Comprehension has many degrees and orders of magnitude. Understanding is bottomless.

	By that logic you would really love it in Saudi Arabia.

<p>
	It's easy to maintain a strong nuclear family with force and oppression. When a woman cannot even get a credit card or passport without her husband's approval, yeah, she will stay in the nuclear family. She has no viable alternative.

	You can certainly go out sober and pump up your state in the club so much that you will feel intoxicated simply on fun. I've done this. It feels like being drunk. Dancing is a great way to pump up your state, as is approaching girls. Lots of approaches will pump your state up to crazy levels. Having good friends with you will also pump your state up.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to become socially uninhibited it to go out to nightclubs very often and push your comfort zone in the club with dancing, flirting, talking, having fun, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Hell, you can even fuck in the club! That will pump up your state for sure <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	Nothing has to be. You can trust whoever you want, but trust does not guarantee truth. Every time you trust someone about something you are creating an opening for being wrong. So if something is important to you, you better verify it yourself. The unimportant stuff you can trust people on.

	Well, of course that's the case. But I wasn't even going to that absolute level.

<p>
	Femininity still uses mind. It just uses it in different ways. Feminine mind, masculine mind, kangaroo mind, alien mind.

<p>
	Indeed

<p>
	We need to move towards one person, one vote, and seriously raise taxes on the wealthy and giant corporations, and break up monopolies, and ban lobbying, and publicly finance elections.

<p>
	These basic changes would solve most of the problems.

<p>
	The name of their game is to be very right-wing but make it look tempered and reasonable.
</p>

<p>
	Sort of like how George W Bush was a "compassionate conservative". Almost every right winger has to draw a line between themselves and Nazis because it's just too blatantly hypocritical to be aligned with Nazis. And frankly, most of today's conservatives are more evolved than Nazis so they aren't wrong to draw that line.

	They don't conflate that. They separate themselves from the far-right. As gross as Prager is, even he would denounce Nazis and holocaust deniers and racism (I hope).

	Well, to be fair, by this logic cops shouldn't stop DUIs and all medicine should be sold over-the-counter.
</p>

<p>
	Government has always controlled what you can put in your body. Altering one's chemistry is dangerous stuff when done by fools.
</p>

<p>
	And we certainly need leaders. As a leader himself, it's funny how Hancock doesn't understand the importance of conscious leadership.

</p>

<p>
	Bolton thought Trump was Orange, only to discover that Trump was actually Red.
</p>

<p>
	This is where the power of Spiral Dynamics really shines. Once you know it, you'll never get duped like this.

</p>

<p>
	And they aren't wrong for doing that, per se. Most conservatives are not holocaust deniers or white supremacists.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that both sides make fine distinctions of their side and almost no distinction among the other side. To a conservative, all progressives are radical Maoist communists. To a progressive, all conservatives are fascist, racist, neo-Nazis. And thus nothing gets resolved.

	It makes no difference what sensation you focus on. I use visual examples because most of us are highly visual creatures and our visual fidelity is highest.

	Plenty of Zen masters got enlightened by focusing on sound. Sound can be an excellent meditation target. As can bodily sensations like pressure or breathing.

			Point. What I meant was an elite, who occupies a position of power, starts to believe stuff along the lines of 'I'm here because of my hard work. I deserve it while those losers out there, they don't!' That's what I meant by identifying as an elite, or a 'winner in the free market'.

	I believe I am here because of my hard work and that I deserve it and that many people don't because they didn't do what I did to get to where I am.

	By definition, anything you have you will feel like you deserve. Especially if you worked hard for it. It's almost impossible to have a decent degree of success without feeling like you deserve it.

			but then there's a new discovery saying that if you repeat the word "banana" 100 times, it will somehow affect your basal ganglia, which is responsible for habits, and all of your bad habits will be gone (a VERY absurd example, which is not true at all <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />) I just want to get my point across that people will believe it more when it is backed by proof of the brain.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In this case the only way you'll know if it's true is if you do the action and test it for yourself. Say banana 100 times and see what happens.
</p>

<p>
	Without doing that, notice, all you have a belief. The science could turn out to be false. This happens often.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, we can talk about brains as long as we remember that we are talking about a relative, imaginary construct of the mind. We can talk about conceptual stuff but the key is not to get lost in our concepts and start confusing them for reality.
</p>

<p>
	Again, you have to be extremely careful with how your mind weaves strong imaginary narratives such as: "To optimize my sleep I must change the brain and the brain is a real organ, etc." << all that is relative stuff.
</p>

<p>
	"The brain" is a conceptual narrative which grounds your entire sense of reality. Which is why it's so difficult for your to shake free of it. You see, you've hinged your very life on it. So this puts you in an existential bind. If you question the brain too much, you will lose a piece of yourself. Some part of you will die. And you don't want to die.
</p>

<p>
	To you, reality comes from the brain.
</p>

<p>
	To a Muslim, reality comes from Allah.
</p>

<p>
	To a kid, Christmas gifts come from Santa Clause.
</p>

<p>
	All these are imaginary constructs to which we grow attached and which are difficult to let go of because they are so fundamental to our worldview. If Santa Clause is imaginary, where do gifts come from? The kid is confused. He does not yet know the true origin. That takes work to discover.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You might be surprised to learn that most elites don't identify as being elites. "Elites" is a notion that normies invented in many ways.
</p>

<p>
	I don't wake up every morning thinking to myself, "I'm an elite". But some normie might think of me as an elite if he sees my bank account. Often times an "elite" is just a passionate, hard working person doing his best to help the world as he sees fit.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The fundamental problem I have with conspiracy theories is that they misunderstand the motivations of people. They tend to ascribe evil motives to people without recognizing that all humans, be they normie or elite, are acting out of what they think is best for the world.
</p>

<p>
	What needs to be understood is that when a normie wakes up in the morning and goes to work, he thinks he's doing something good. And when an elite wakes up in the morning and goes to work, he thinks he's doing something good.

<p>

<p>
	Of course later generations can free-load off the wealth of their ancestors. And in such cases the wealth quickly gets lost. Trump lost daddy's $400 mil. He would be richer if he just put all that money into a bank CD.

	Fundamentally this work is about seeking TRUTH. What is true?
</p>

<p>
	Is it true that your brain is imaginary? Is it true that a scientific theory is imaginary? Take a look.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever is true is what is true. My opinion about it is irrelevant.

			What if I'm reading a book RIGHT NOW on optimizing your sleep to improve the brain and what it does to it. But, whatever the effects on the brain it has (according the book) I just dismiss that because there's no brain? so then I just sleep 1 hour a day (just an example).

<p>
	You can optimize your sleep without needing to appeal to some metaphysical notion of a brain. In the same way that you can eat a banana without needing to bring to mind the atoms which you imagine it is made of.
</p>

<p>
	Chimpanzees have been eating bananas for a million years without knowing anything about atoms. You can read about atoms, but don't confuse atoms for a banana. Atoms are imaginary. And just because atoms are imaginary does mean that you cannot now optimize how you eat bananas.

<p>
	You are supposed to think: "Is that psychologist in the room with me? No? Then he's imaginary! And so is his bullshit scientific explanation."
</p>

<p>
	You are going to have to seriously question the foundations of science here. Science is not true as you were led to believe. Science contains some partial and relative truths, but it cannot grasp Absolute Truth, Consciousness, or existential questions. Science cannot ever tell you what you are. This is a meta-scientific question. Science cannot tell you what anything is in the absolute sense. Science can only make relative comparisons between things. Science cannot ever get at the thing itself.
</p>

<p>
	For example, science cannot tell you what red is, or what a chair is, or what matter is, or what energy is, or what time is, or what a number is. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that science has never given you a bottom line answer about what ANYTHING is! Start to wonder why that is.
</p>

			Ok, these last days I kept on doing the self inquiry about who I really am and I keep on coming back to the brain. The one who generates the thought, the one who processes the information, the one who's aware of everything. I can not pin point directly which part of the brain I am, but I consider all of it to work together and makes up who I am because if for instance, let's say the amygdala is taken away, then some emotions will also be gone, but I will still be there. If someone shoots me in the brain then Im gone.

<p>
	Dude! Cut the shit.
</p>

<p>
	There is no brain in your direct experience. You've never seen your brain. Notice that.
</p>

<p>
	This work is 100% about sticking to what is present in your direct experience. If it's not in your direct experience it does not exist. That means the back of your head does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	You need to be ruthless here about noticing what is actually present in direct experience vs whatever your mind is imagining.
</p>

<p>
	You are imagining your brain right now. Notice this. This is not a theory. This is literally what is happening in your experience. Take your finger and point at the brain and notice if the pointer is pointing to nothing.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what your mind is saying, you must look strictly at what exists in direct experience. The mind is constantly imagining all sorts of fantasies. You must not fall prey to them.
</p>

<p>
	Is your mother in the room with you right now? No? Then she does not exist. That's what is literally true. The rest is fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	The whole trick here is to not believe your own lying mind. Your own mind is constantly lying to you because it is constructing reality. You have to catch the mind in the act of construction, and stop it. Otherwise you will forever be living in a self-constructed fantasy while thinking you are looking at reality.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously. This is true by definition.
</p>

<p>
	The thing you have to take into account, though, is whether maybe they deserve that power. The reality is that some people are much better leaders than most, and are much more visionary, talented, capable, educated, hard working, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying that Bill Gates deserves $100 billion because he worked a billion times harder than his employees. But you have to admit, Bill Gates is an exceptional leader and visionary who accomplished things that very few normies could. So of course he has more wealth and power than a normie.
</p>

<p>
	And I would offer the following point which most populists will find hard to swallow: Bill Gates is more developed than the average person and he actually uses his wealth and power in a more responsible way than a normie would. If you give $100 billion to a normie they will get corrupted by it and use it for all sorts of selfishness and evil. I think most normies don't appreciate how evil Bill Gates could be if he really wanted to with that amount of wealth and power. Bill Gates is an exceptionally developed person relative to the national average.

<p>
	To some degree. But largely what normies believe is not so much dictated by elites as it a function of collective cultural forces which are beyond the control of any one individual elite, or even a well organized group of elites.
</p>

<p>
	And also, elites themselves do not control what elites believe. Elites themselves are products of their culture which they are nearly powerless to stop.
</p>

<p>
	The boundary between elites and normies is not so clear-cut.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, but this is a generic problem of the mind which will not be fixed by dethroning elites. A mob of normies could be even more cult-like because it has no sensible leadership.
</p>

<p>
	In many situations a small group of highly educated and talented elites is far preferable to a mob of ignorant normies. Which is precisely why elites have a lot of power. You have to wonder, how did they get it to begin with? They got it because they were more effective than a mob of normies.
</p>

<p>
	A small team of 10 highly exceptional and ambitious people is superior in effectiveness to a mob of 100,000 mediocre people. To distribute power evenly across those 100,000 people could actually create a disaster.

	How to get a girlfriend:
</p>

<p>
	Step 0: Stop fucking whining and making excuses.
</p>

<p>
	Step 1: GO OUT and talk to girls in real life. And keep fucking doing it regularly.
</p>

<p>
	Step 2: Snuggle after sex.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Also works: become a successful leader who offers massive value to the world, and girls will come to you begging. This is actually the most powerful way. But most guys are too lazy and incompetent to do it.

<p>
	This is just not true. You see it that way because you lean conservative and so that's part of your mind's confirmation bias.
</p>

<p>
	Plenty of radical lefties get censored too. In fact, in any given society, radical lefties are more censored than right wingers because the right wingers are aligned with the status quo while radical lefties risk the threat of upsetting the status quo and getting killed for it.
</p>

<p>
	History is full of radical lefties getting killed for their progressive ideas and values, and getting censored.
</p>

<p>
	As but one example, in American history, socialism has been demonized and censored A LOT over the last 70 years.
</p>

<p>
	Progressives are routinely kicked off the air on mainstream media channels like CNN and MSNBC. News anchors who were strongly against the Iraq War, for example, were routinely fired at MSNBC because their views were bad for business. There is a lot of incentive for businesses to censor progressives because progressives often challenge the business's drive for unchecked profit.
