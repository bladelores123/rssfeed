<p>
	Calling it imagary tells you that the world is a mental construction.

It's just a neat concept which you can appreciate if you do psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Reality isn't really a strange loop, it is Infinity. But when you try to think causually about Infinity you will run into strange loops. Strange loops are the result of a finite mind trying to grasp Infinity.

			This is perfect example of why the very idea of good, progress, evolution, betterment of society is a wrong kind of direction in your spiritual life. Desire to better society is the source of many evil, deaths and suffering. I think the authentic spiritual orientation must be fighting society, not improving it. Perhaps people who wanted to better society - have invented covid. And if not people, then let's say reality has invented covid in order to better society. Then the very desire to improve society is wrong and lead to bad outcomes. Think about it, what good society does for person, society only brainwashes person. So I guess its here not for us to improve it but for us to oppose it. If you improve it - you are helping it to increase its brainwashing power. Re-think your big picture.

<p>
	This is delusional.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a massive ego to think you know better the course of mankind than society.

<p>
	Society is like a tree. It just grows. And now you want to come and cut it down. It is growing as it should.

<p>
	Actually, ego IS the sense of self, and it is a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Perceptions alone do not generate a sense of self. People who are conscious of no-self (no-ego) still have experiences and perceptions. Just no human self tying it all together.

<p>
	I don't like being in a club. That's not how I blow off steam.

<p>
	I went out to nightclubs and bars for about 2 years in a row.
</p>

<p>
	In that time I had maybe 2 drinks, which were offered to me for free and I drank them just to be polite.

<p>
	Right-wingers are some of biggest victims and cry-babies.
</p>

<p>
	They only take responsibility when it suits them and as much as their mind is capable of understanding, which isn't much.
</p>

<p>
	I want to see a right-winger take responsibility for terrorism, racism, slavery, wage slavery, corporatism, nationalism, environmental destruction, 3rd world exploitation, paying fair taxes, and patriarchy.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck. Lol
</p>

<p>
	They cannot take responsibility for these things because their mind does not understand them holistically enough.
</p>

<p>
	Right-wingers who take responsibility for the above are otherwise known as progressives.
</p>

<p>
	You aren't approaching enough and aren't letting go enough.
</p>

<p>
	At least one night in your life go be a party animal. Dance until you are sweaty and out of breath. Be silly and stupid. Then watch how girls get drawn to you like a magnet.
</p>

<p>
	Do it sober. But by the middle of the night will become naturally intoxicated on fun. You will become fearless. You will stop giving a fuck about what anyone thinks of you.

<p>
	To be honest, Owen can be a weird douche. But at a nightclub this is okay.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to go out, let loose, and have some fun socializing. This can be done in a way where no one gets hurt.
</p>

<p>
	I challenge you guys to go out one night and just have more fun than you've ever had in your life. And do it sober. Girls love guys who know how to have fun.
</p>

<p>
	The right has its self-improvement ways. It's usually either mainstream religion or something like Jordan Peterson.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't expect it to be anything brilliant or cutting edge. It's gonna be conformist, traditional, and materialistic.
</p>

<p>
	Everything I teach is about questioning social dogmas, so by definition this will not sit well with right-wingers. They are not interested in deconstructing culture, they are interested in defending it. That's either whole MO.

			It’s like we’re being told something else in school and the reality is completely different. I was told you have to verbally ask a woman every time you do something.
		</p>

		<p>
			But here you are saying something else. That it’s okay to touch and kiss under certain circumstances depending on her mood and setting. We, as men, are getting mixed messages from movies, songs, media, school, You, and friends. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>It’s like you’re saying, you can do it, probably need to do it, but it’s also kind of against the law and a taboo. As I understand this.</b>

<p>
	As with many other domains, school left you totally unperpared to handle the realities of dating and sex.
</p>

<p>
	School does not teach those realities at all.
</p>

<p>
	Dating and sexuality is highly context sensitive and implicit. It is also so tied in with survival that it must be tightly regulated by the powerful because they want to fuck the best people themselves. So they will tell you one thing but then actually do the opposite themselves in their own private sex lives.
</p>

<p>
	Harsh truths about sex are like harsh truths about spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Flirting, playful touching, and being a good salesmen are not against the law. It's not even taboo. It happens in nightclubs and bars everywhere in the world and is generally considered acceptable. But talking openly about it is often unacceptable, especially in the MeToo era.
</p>

<p>
	Do some guys take the flirting and touching overboard into rapey territory? Sure! Some do. But you can also do it in a decent manner. Go flirt with some girls. No problem. Never force yourself on her if she isn't smiling while you do it. Her facial experssion tells you everything. If she's laughing and smiling and looking deep in your eyes, you can basically rip off her panties and do whatever you want. But as soon as her smile turns into a frown, that's when you stop. The key is to ATTRACT and CHARM her. This is very different than force.

<p>
	If it was truly unnecessary we would be able to easily eliminate it. But it's not so easy. So maybe it's more necessary than you imagine?

	But that's exactly what mankind has done for a million years. It's in your blood. You will do it when required or pay another to do it.

	We live in a complex economy where it's not feasible to do every detail of life yourself. A lot of ugly stuff is hidden within the vast complexity of the economy. And yet you cannot avoid the economy. Oil and gas might be killing the planet, but our economy cannot survive without it.

<p>
	I thought maybe I could try healing it and stopping it. But the more conscious I got, the more I realized it is Love and doesn't need my stopping it.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes to take away an obstacle is a disservice, weakening the student. Don't wish for life to be easier, wish for yourself to be stronger.
</p>

<p>
	This corona shit is just something mankind has to grapple with to reach the next level of evolution and love. You can't make all viruses disappear, more will come. We must rebuild society to function better for more people.

	You are not going to survive an Alaskan winter on fruits and vegetables.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to survive on vegan if you have certain health conditions.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to survive on raw vegan if you don't have enough money.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	The reason people eat what they eat is because that's what allows them to survive. Of course this can be changed, but not always. And survival is a much more complex affair than merely meeting your calorie needs.

<p>
	You can make an artform out of using toilet paper. The depth of any activity is as deep as you make it. You are creating the meaning behind it. So as long as you're able to trick yourself into thinking it's meaningful, it will appear meaningful to you.

<p>
	Lol, pickup in the MeToo era is gonna be seriously misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with dating hot women is that they actually like be dominated. But good luck explaining that to a MeToo audience.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I am not advocating sexual assault or rape, but most of these Reddit people calling pickup "sexual assault" are doing a disservice to the term "sexual assault." Stuff that goes on at a strip club or night club is very different than stuff that goes on at work, for example. In a night club it is appropriate to touch women in sexual ways while obviously not at work. People go to nightclubs in order to let loose and be sexual. That doesn't justify rape or actual assault, but squeezing a girl's butt in a playful way at a nightclub is not assault. Many women expect to be manipulated into sex. It's not like you go up to a woman and ask her, "Hi there. Shall we have sex tonight? Yes or No?" That's not how dating works. The woman is going to play coy and she is going to make dumb excuses and make the guy chase her. That is the mating ritual.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if she ever gives you a hard "NO!", then you stop. But short of that, the guy is allowed to keep pressuring her because she will play games. It's not that big a problem. She should know if she wants sex or not. And if she doesn't, she should state so clearly and the guy should stop and things are fine.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest distinction between pickup and MeToo is that the MeToo sexual abuse cases often involve positions of authority at work, where a boss exploits his female staff. This is very different than two strangers flirting and hooking up at a nightclub or bar.  The situation is a lot more fair and balanced at the nightclub. The girl is free to reject the guy at any time with little consequence or threat to her. Flirting and even a bit of groping and kissing at a club is not sexual assault, it's business as usual. But at work, that's a big problem because the girl has no option to leave and the boss has too much leverage over her.
</p>

<p>
	All of life is imagined by God, so of course past lives are too. The entire past is. God has no life and no past unless it imagines one.
</p>

<p>
	This I have been directly conscious of.
</p>

<p>
	If some spiritual teacher is talking about past lives, that's your clue that they are not fully Awake. There is no life or past at all at the highest level of Consciousness.

<p>
	Yes. Since Consciousness is Unlimited, it is 100% in perfect communication with itself at all times, unless it chooses not to be.
</p>

<p>
	And even modern science validates this. If a flea jumps on a planet 100 million light years away, the rest of the universe knows about it instantly, although it might take millions of years for the light and gravity waves of that event to fully propagate through space and time. A flea jumping 100 million light years away affects every other point in the universe. Reality could not function without 100% perfect self-communication.

<title>Are green people really cognetively superior to blue people?</title>

<p>
	There are many levels to Green. Many people's Green runs only skin deep, as beliefs and ideology. It's like a Green veneer. It takes a lot of inner work to reach solid Green. You can't reach solid Green merely through adopting liberal beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	Few Democrats are solid Green. They are mostly Orange with a Green veneer. But most people don't know any better. So we get this wolf in sheep's clothing effect -- as seen with the corporate Dems.
</p>

<p>
	Never forget, there are always devils around who will try to convince the world that they are one color when they are actually a few colors lower. This makes understanding Spiral Dynamics a bit tricky. You have to really develop a keen eye.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Trump seems Orange, but he's got a solid Red foundation with a bunch of Orange veneer. And it fools A LOT of smart people, not to mention the dumb ones. So watch out for fakers.
</p>

<p>
	To be at solid Green requires not just beliefs but an opening of the heart. You have to really empathize with other beings around the world. This cannot be faked. It's an honest signal. And yes, good education in a highly developed society can help you to open your heart. Good education is not merely book-smarts.
</p>

<p>
	The one reality is the sum total of all the lenses/perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	Appearance IS reality.
</p>

<p>
	Wahtever you are imagining becomes true for you. Because you are God, creating yourself.
</p>

<p>
	So if God wants to create a Mormon, he imagines himself being a Mormon for 80 years. And thus a Mormon is made. Until it is unmade. Which is why a Mormon must insist that he's real and not just something God imagines. To be a "Mormon" requires the denial that Mormons are imaginary. Now replace Mormon with scientist or human. That's why everyone is in denial about God, especially the religous and scientific folk.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you imagine the internet right now. If you stopped imagining it, you'd realize you are communicating with me right now directly, telepathically. Since I am just a fragment inside your own mind. But you need to deny that because you are attached to the idea of an external objective reality.

	The name of the game is imagiming shit and then denying you imagined it. You imagined Leo, yet you deny it!

</blockquote>

<p>
	Environment is a huge factor.
</p>

<p>
	Yes! Just the mere fact of being born in a developed part of society makes you more developed. If you were born in the Congo or the Amazon rainforest, you would certainly be less developed. Because humans are not merely individual brains. We are a herd species with hive minds. You cannot survive as an individual at all.
</p>

<p>
	So-called Western values do have some advantages. In developed countries people are taught how to think more independently and skeptically. The education systems of each color are very different. A stage Blue Islamic school is not the same as a stage Green Montessori school. The first one indoctrinates, the second one teaches students how to think for themselves. Of course it's not perfect, Green can still have lots of indoctrination, but it's way better than Blue, which basically just enslaves your mind.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of educational development is about infrastructure, which is both physical and intellectual. It takes thousands of years of intellectual infrastructure to produce high quality thinkers. This is not an individual accomplishment. You can't have an Einstein without the entire system that created him.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I can definitely confirm this is false.
</p>

<p>
	Personal sensitivity is a huge factor. You can easily validate this yourself by reading trip reports and tripping with a wide variety of friends. Your friends will react in very different ways to the same dose.
</p>

<p>
	At this point I have taken so much 5-MeO-DMT that I don't take any more. It's become too powerful for me. So not only does sensitively vary from person to person, it will change for you over time as you go deeper with each trip. So be careful. You will become more sensitive after some deep breakthroughs.

<p>
	Actually he has. Green is able to think more perspectivally, independently, relativistically, more compassionately than Blue. The Blue mind in some cases literally cannot compute Green's way of thinking, while Green can compute Blue. Although Green can struggle to understand Blue's inability to compute.
</p>

<p>
	This does NOT make Green superior in any absolute sense, but yes, relatively superior at the cognitive level.
</p>

<p>
	If you just compare a stage Blue thinker to a stage Green thinker, it's like a Toyota Corolla vs a BMW.
</p>

<p>
	Compare someone like Ben Shapiro vs Sam Seder. Totally different caliber of thinking. But that doesn't make Sam Seder always right or superior as a living being. There are much higher levels.

So there is no choice from God's POV. The only things God allows are Truth/Love because that what God IS.
</p>

<p>
	God is Absolute Perfection precisely because God is unconditional Love.
</p>

<p>
	But your ego-mind cannot understand this because it is stuck judging every bit of reality because you fear death. That's the illusion of survival. You're stuck in survival consciousness while God is not.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to this is radically raising your state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Choice does not exist. God is Absolute Love. Period. Nothing but Love exists. All else is misperception, which itself is also Absolute Love!
</p>

<p>
	Yes it does. Because that's how God's Goodness works. The "bad" is precisely there because it creates a higher Good.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter if he does or does not reconcile with her. Her work is to forgive him and his work is forgive himself.
</p>

<p>
	No justice is needed.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how you are projecting your personal standards of morals and justice on the world. This is holding you back from LOVE.

	That's good too, but that is your judgment. You are looking for people to act in ways that makes your ego feel comfortable. But the universe has no such obligation and so in this way you will cause your own suffering and until you realize the error of your ways.

		</p>

		<p>
			What girl are you talking about, the stripper? I'm pretty sure Owen never raped a stripper and it's clear that he was sarcastic when talking about it.
		</p>

		<p>
			His friend Julien Blanc had a huge media scandal in 2014 where he was accused of rape as well. If you spent maybe an hour or 2 watching his content before it happened, you'd find out he actually teaches to take it slow, be able to take a step back, not make a girl uncomfortable etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			What RSD did to Todd Valentine was questionable but trust me, they are not rapists.
		</p>

		<p>
			Tyler also recognizes that getting laid itself won't make you happy, he's been saying that since 2010. Same for Julien.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I stand by my points not only if all of them are rapists, but also murders. The judgment is your projection. That's the deep realization you must see if you want to reach the highest levels of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Or don't. It's fine either way.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not going to force you to love.

			Strong display of bias. So you probably grew up without sports.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sport is art. I’m surprised you haven’t realized yet at this stage. Take away the competitiveness and it is pure art and joy. The best athletes put on their greatest display when they lose themselves in the joy of the activity. What’s the difference between that and dedicating ones life to music? Whats the difference between Ronaldinho and Mozart? Only different modes of expression. But maybe you condemn other artists the same way, I don’t know. Just a heads up on the bias.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here’s some pure artistry for you
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can find some artistry in sports. But that's not what the professional sports industry is designed to cater to. It is a business built on tribalism.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, you are free to do sports. I was merely explaining why you won't find a lot of high consciousness people in sports. That is all.
</p>

<p>
	You can turn rapid hot-dog eating into an art and compare it to Mozart. But don't be surprised when you don't find the highest grade of consciousness in your colleagues. And don't be surprised when it wrecks your body and you can't do it any more.
</p>

<p>
	A display of mastery is a rather Orange level thing. A true master doesn't need to strut around like a cock.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Those ways are some of the fastest, but still takes time.
</p>

<p>
	You can always do the techniques twice or even three times as much per day. But also, be careful what you wish for. Slow and steady is usually better than too much too fast.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga requires patience and steady discipline.

</p>

<p>
	In the end, out of all the potential things there are to do in this world, are you seriously going to devote your whole life to being good a throwing or hitting a ball?
</p>

<p>
	Do you see how shallow that is in the grande scheme of things? Once you see that -- which takes some higher consciousness -- then you're not likely to get seduced by that illusion.
</p>

<p>
	But, of course, you're free to do as you like. I'm just explaining why you're not going to find a lot of highly conscious people in sports. Sports is an industry designed for cavemen, not sages.

<p>
	Vegan diet does not work for all people.
</p>

<p>
	So there is the "need".
</p>

<p>
	Judgment of meat-eating is, in a sense, a worse offense than the meat-eating itself. Because by rejecting meat-eaters you reject yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same problem as judging criminals or terrorists. It seems reasonable and justified, but it rots your mind and soul and keeps you from the highest levels of consciousness and love.
</p>

<p>
	Vegans don't appreciate the spiritual complexities of this issue. They like to think from their own POV, which is ironic considering how they care about the POV of animals. But what about the POV humans?

</p>

<p>
	If you can't see the value of the above video, regardless of whether Owen is a rapist or a murderer, then you're missing something.
</p>

<p>
	People are not good or bad. People are morally complex. Often their bad parts are redeemed by their good parts.
</p>

<p>
	Owen is a very complex guy. He has a troubled and criminal past. Which is what will make his final transformation so inspiring if he pulls it off. He knows all this and it fuels him.

<p>
	No, you can't stop those things through argument. In fact, if you argue about that, you'll likely spur it on.
</p>

<p>
	Try to distinguish between discussion/advice/logic vs argumentation.
</p>

<p>
	Logically explaining the consequences of someone's action to them CAN help them to rethink their behaviors. But not argumentation.

<p>
	It could develop your writing skills.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see how it will get you any closer to the publishing industry, as that's more of a sales/marketing/biz domain.
</p>

<p>
	Being a writer is TOTALLY different from being a publisher.
</p>

<p>
	Decide clearly on what you actually want. Do you want to write amazing books or do you want sell/publish the books of other people?
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be great writer, you will never achieve that merely through a degree. You must be writing non-stop in your own free time. That's how true writing skills are developed. Plan to invest 10,000 hours in writing on your own time for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be a publisher, look into degrees about marketing and biz.
</p>

<p>
	In general, you shouldn't major in a thing unless you can see yourself working many years in that field.
</p>

<p>
	Are you going to be working in math or engineering for at least 10 years? Philosophy? Then don't bother. You don't have time to waste on that shit. Time is too precious.
</p>

<p>
	Find the thing you can work 10 years in at least.

<p>
	You can always ask directly: "What would your ideal candidate look like?" Then try to actually fit that.
</p>

<p>
	You can also ask, "Do you have any hesitations hiring me? What are they? Let me address them and show you why I'm the best you'll find for this position."

</p>

<p>
	If you had the proper skills, resume, interview process, and presentation -- you'd get the job.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it from the employer's POV: as an employer you would NEVER hire a person based on random draw or luck. Why would you play dice with your business? That'd be foolish. You're always looking to hire the best person that is available at a reasonable price. You are screening out people who aren't the best fit.
</p>

<p>
	Employers NEVER pick candidates by throwing around darts. Employers are looking for every specific markers, so getting hired is about knowing those markers and nail them. Each job has different markers, requiring a customized approach.
</p>

<p>
	As with most of the realizations we talk about, it's not a binary. It's not merely a matter of getting it or not. It's a question of how deeply do you get it?
</p>

<p>
	If you ask the average person off the street whether people look at the world through different lenses, he would say, "YES! Of course! Duh!"
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean he has even begun to understand the ramifications of what that means. Does he understand that there is no reality independent of the lens one is looking through? Does he understand that terrorism, rape, and incest are relative lenses? Does he understand that physical reality is a relative lens?
</p>

<p>
	Not unless he's Yellow or above. And even then, he still doesn't understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	Truth cannot be argued or argued with.
</p>

<p>
	The more one argues, the less truth one understands.
</p>

<p>
	Have you noticed that the most argumentative people are the most false?
</p>

<p>
	And the most truthful people are the least argumentative?
</p>

<p>
	Why is that? How do you explain that?

</p>

<p>
	The greatest power is not to demand everyone be squeaky clean but to love everyone despite all their devilry. The bigger the devil, the greater your opportunity to demonstrate your love.
</p>

<p>
	When you require people not to be devils, that's actually coming from lack of total self-acceptance. The devil cannot be avoided, the devil must be accepted as your self.

<p>
	I doubt there was any awakening here at all.
</p>

<p>
	How is medication gonna awaken you?
</p>

<p>
	Way too much jumping to conclusions here. Such overly generalized statements can be dangerous because none of know what this user is really describing. The user himself might not know.
</p>

<p>
	This work requires precision and clarity. If you are facing a spiritual problem, please describe it extra clearly and carefully so there's no ambiguity and we can give you clear answers.

<p>
	That could be a very convenient defense mechanism for your ego.
</p>

<p>
	Criticism and judgment are red-flags for ignorance and falsehood. When you in possession of Truth, you don't judge or criticize much, you appreciate even ignorant people.

<p>
	What do you mean when you say "spiritual awakening"?
</p>

<p>
	And what does this have to do with meditation, meds, and mental hospitals?
</p>

<p>
	Be careful making such broad general statements. They are easily misunderstood, even by yourself, let alone others.
</p>

<p>
	What is your mental health history prior to meditation?

<title>Sharing my path: RASA, Depression, Psychedelics, Ashram, Romantic Love</title>

<p>
	Be careful with RASA, shaktipat, and this whole Ramaji gang. They are not deeply Awake and following them too closely will lead to delusions. Not to mention that they harbor dogmas and ignorance against psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you reach "1000", that's still a joke compared to true Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You should not rely on a guru to Awaken you. Ultimately it will not work. Which is not to say you shouldn't experiment and try various techniques. For those of you for whom RASA has helped, great. But just know, there's much more beyond RASA.

<p>
	Anything is possible. But my thyroid disease was diagnosed over 10 years ago, before I started Actualized.org
</p>

<p>
	So be careful about jumping to conclusions. Such health issues can be very complex and involve many independent variables.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I don't feel that psychedelics affect my thyroid one way or another. But of course you never know how some new chemical might affect your body in unknown ways. That is true of all medication, supplements, and even food.

Until then, it's just a story. I'm trying to be intellectually honest.

<p>
	That human is you.
</p>

<p>
	Stop being lazy and expecting others to prove your own nature to you.
</p>

<p>
	You are Infinite Consciousness, which means you are capable of Total Omniscience and infinite telepathic ability. But it takes serious work. This isn't for dabblers or naysayers.
</p>

<p>
	Intellectual honesty is good. But it doesn't make you right.
</p>

<p>
	Once you completely deconstruct materialism, telepathy becomes quite a reasonable possibility. QM shows us that two particles can communicate instantly across cosmic spacial distances. That's a tiny clue that Consciousness is not seperated from itself in any fundamental way. Consciousness can know all parts of itself instantly. That's what Absolute means.

			Although you, Leo had the privilege to be of the top 0.0000000001 percent of humanity who have reached such highs that you're talking about, but what does it make you believe that it is OK to dive more into the infinite levels of consciousness? What's so special about you? Why you want to do that? What does your ego want to achieve?

<p>
	It's not about having to, it's about wanting to.

<p>
	No one is forcing you to do anything.

<p>
	If you lack ambition you won't understand an ambitious person. And that's okay. Most people are not ambitious.

Period.
</p>

<p>
	But that's easy to say and hard to do, as it requires massive consciousness of all of one's mind's self-deception mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
	You CAN support a system without being ideological about it. But it tends to be quite rare.

			Here are stuff you are missing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes formless state is epic but it is case now. That formless Love is manifested as YOU. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But right now see how much more you get in some sense right now then in that state. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Take a close look at this dream, you can create you can do and love you can share you can do all sorts of things. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Take a close look, holly fuck this is fucking miracle and it's actually more amazing then that. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Me drinking coffee and typing this to you is OMG I can do this stuff, it's epic. Sounds silly but it is True. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I can help you you can help me we can Love all that we are. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Take a close look at Physicality it's quite actually best possible shape so to speak that Love can take.

	You were right, I was wrong.

<p>
	But then again, I am you and you are me, so what's the difference?
