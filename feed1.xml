<p>
	It makes perfect sense. Sex calms the mind and body, makes focusing on serious business easy.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to focus when you are a thirsty dog.

<p>
	A radical change in your state of consciousness is necessary.
</p>

<p>
	The human mind would basically have to die. You would have to experience a death so deep you surrender survival itself.
</p>

<p>
	You will not accomplish this through any trick or manipulation. You have to actually surrender the entire game of life.
</p>

<p>
	You have not descontructed your mind sufficiently to reach Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	You are still under the illusion that you are a human who has experiences.
</p>

<p>
	You have clearly not listened to those videos sufficiently, because I certainly explained it. 
</p>

<p>
	You are trying to understand awakening without awakening, and that will never work.
</p>

<p>
	The answer to your question is AWAKENING! Not words.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing further to discuss here. Go do the work to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	You can, but if you have no prior psychedelic experience it will be so radical you will probably freak out big time.
</p>

<p>
	The radicalness of 5-MeO-DMT cannot be overstated. You should have prior experience getting mindfucked on lesser psychedelics. It's very easy to overdo 5-MeO to the point of trauma.

	Open your mind to the possibility of Absolute Truth. Until you open your mind to this, you will forever be deluded, lost in beliefs and assumptions.

<p>
	Your fundamental problem is that you simply believe that Absolute Truth cannot ever be accessed. And this is false. That's an unquestioned assumption you hold.

<p>
	Absolute Consciousness is not any kind of belief.

<p>
	Funnily enough, it is you who holds a belief that Absolute Consciousness is a belief. But this is false. So drop that belief.

<p>
	You need to change your state of consciousness via hardcore concentration practice. Stop thinking about who you are and focus on building up concentration.
</p>

<p>
	You can do that with mindfulness with labling or via Kriya yoga. I highly recommend Kriya yoga, it quiets the mind nicely.
</p>

<p>
	Work towards stilling your mind and just sitting in emptiness with no thoughts. Your true nature will reveal itself naturally once your mind is still and highly concentrated.
</p>

<p>
	No there aren't!
</p>

<p>
	Scientists are not allowed to study aliens or UFOs. That would cause them to lose their jobs and credibilty. So no serious scientist is working on it because it would destroy his career.

<p>
	Try 2-4 weeks raw veggies/fruits and compare with 2-4 weeks beef/chicken. That would give you a clean baseline. Then you could experiment with others things like grains or dairy. Find which food groups work worst for you and then avoid them for life.

<p>
	Change and time are commonly confused, but actually change can occur without time. Time is an additional layer of imagination on top of the base layer of change.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, change can occur within Eternity.
</p>

<p>
	Time is a conceptual projection onto Being.
</p>

<p>
	The evidence for aliens is not any single UFO sighting, but the massive preponderance of evidence from thousands of different sources. You have to connect the dots to see it, rather than mindless pulling part one case at a time.
</p>

<p>
	Once you survey all the cases, all the evidence from all the sources you realize: aliens are the most reasonable, obvious, and scientific conclusion.

<p>
	You can try natural antibacterials first such as Allicin, Oregano oil, and others.
</p>

<p>
	But you will have to take them longer, for at least a month. And it may not wipe out H pylori.
</p>

<p>
	Antibiotics are pretty good for H pylori.

<p>
	Stage Green has many such anti-corpo, anti-vax, all-natural lifestyle ideas.
</p>

<p>
	There is plenty of delusion within stage Green.
</p>

<p>
	People tend to think stage Green is supposed to be perfect. Well, it ain't. Surprise!

<p>
	I would like to know exactly which date this high culture existed in. -1000? Nope. -2000? Nope. -5000? Nope
</p>

<p>
	By all measures today is the best time to be alive since the last 5000 years.
</p>

<p>
	To call the last 5000 years of human evolution a mistake is a huge mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Shunya is wise, but he is not wiser than 5000 years of human evolution.
</p>

<p>
	He can barely maintain his little commune of 20 people. And yet he thinks he knows how to restructure the world.

	I have not killed off the bacteria yet, but at least I'm no longer feeding it. Once the bacteria has been weakened for a few weeks, I will hit it with a cocktail of antibiotics and hopefully that will kill it all off. That's the plan.

<p>
	Worrying about the end of the world is silly. The whole point of awakening is to not give a fuck about such things. If the world ends, it ends. No point thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, human civilization is more peaceful and better than ever. There has never been a better time to be alive. Don't let Shunya bullshit your with his stories.
</p>

<p>
	I asked him when human civilization was better. He said in the ancient times. I told him 40% of the ancient Roman population were slaves. He just handwaved my objection away. That little fact didn't fit his worldview so well.
</p>

<p>
	Human civilization is better than ever and it ain't going anywhere. So buckle in and enjoy the ride.

	You want something akin to a systemic reform of how society/culture handles dating education/sex. That is not inherently a bad idea.

<p>
	I make fun of it because it's so unrealistic it won't happen in our lifetime. We will get socialism sooner than that.

	How about this: every hot woman in the country gets put into a jury duty lottery system. When her number comes up, she gets a letter in the mail with a pic of the incel she must open her legs for. Included is the incel's victim story of why life sucks and why talking to girls doesn't work. Incels can go to the SS office to redeem their hottie vouchers. Every incel gets 2 free lays per year with a random hottie.

<p>
	The claim is not metaphysical. The claim is tens of thousands of people have seen UFOs and the reports are too credible and numerous to dismiss at this point. You have to be willfully ignorant to ignore all the reports.
</p>

<p>
	These reports are not made by fools. They are made by serious professionals like Navy and commerical pilots. These people are not just making shit up for fame, and they are not crackpots or lunatics. And what they report is alien technology, not weather balloons or swamp gas or giant birds.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes if it looks like an alien and it flies like an alien, it's an alien.
</p>

<p>
	The evidence pattern is precisely what you would expect from alien spacecraft who didn't wish to land and make a big welcome party.
</p>

<p>
	Science is irrelevant to this matter. If an alien flies over your head, you don't need science to tell you so. And no amount logical deduction can be used to judge the probabilty of it. If an alien flies over your head the probablity is 100%.
</p>

<p>
	Another example of horrible misuse of "science". The science is: you see a fucking alien in the sky, and you say aliens exist. It makes zero difference how many sicentists agree or disagree. It matters not a damn what Neil Degrass Tyson thinks. His thoughts are worth less that a plastic fork in this matter.
</p>

<p>
	Be ware your misuse of skepticism. There is nothing scientific about it. In fact, it gives science a bad name.
</p>

<title>Say Hello To Our New Mods!</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/66601-say-hello-to-our-new-mods/?do=findComment&amp;comment=911806</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	One of the new functions of all Mods, new and old alike, is to keep an eye out of dangerous/reckless activity on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	What this means is, lock down threads and discussions which involve overly risking/reckless use of psychedelics or other methods which could lead to obvious harm or death. And post messages which inform the general public that such activities are dangerous and not what this forum or Actualized.org is about.
</p>

<p>
	Our values here are about healthy and responsible use of psychedelics and other spiritual methods. Nothing that harms the body or leads people into clear danger (like taking 1000ug of LSD).
</p>

<p>
	If you see someone who is unraveling in an unhealthy way, guide them to temporarily suspend their spiritual work until their mind and life stabilizes.
</p>

<p>
	We want to cultivate an ethos of safety around here. We do not want to be associated with anything clearly reckless or dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	And if people are talking seriously about Mahasamadhi, lock that down too. Nobody here should be considering Mahasamadhi.
</p>

<p>
	And if you find anyone being suicidal you report that to me.
</p>

<p>
	And how about empathy for women struggling to find stable long-term male providers?
</p>

<p>
	How about we regulate the dating market such that you cannot sleep with a woman unless you show the government your bank account. And if your bank account has less then $100k cash, no sex for you.
</p>

<p>
	The framing of this entire thread is itself sexist and deeply male-biased. It ignores the reproductive difficulties and agenda of women. Because this thread is just another lame attempt at making excuse for not talking to girls.
</p>

<p>
	The excuses you guys invent are truly crafty. Anything to not talk to a girl.
</p>

<p>
	You feel entitled to sex but you don't feel the need to work for it.
</p>

<p>
	Regulating capitalism is a lot easier than regulating dating. Capitalism already has regulations in place, so tightening those regulations is reasonable and doable. And the excesses of capitalism affect all genders, races, peoples, rather than one segment of the population.

	If one's body can handle it, then I suggest one try it.
</p>

<p>
	Of course people will make up what excuses they want.

<title>If the dating market is a market, then why it's not regulated,at least online dating</title>

<p>
	I am all for better education to help guys not become incels. But the fact is no school is gonna teach you what it takes to pull hot girls and be attractive. You are much better off learning that via online sources like RSD.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is: you can't regulate women to spread their legs for lame, weak, needy, pathetic men who play video games all day and complain on Incel forums.
</p>

<p>
	As far as education goes, you got all you need online for free. The problem is you aren't willing to use it.
</p>

<p>
	In the future I would like to see schools teaching masculunity and femininity courses. But that will still not be enough. The only way to reform an Incel is to send him into the field and do some serious cold approach. School will never do that for him.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I delayed my vaccine was because I had gut problems that I was troubleshooting and it was too many variables to introduce at once.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Today I have a little arm soreness where I got the vaccine. Slept a few hours longer than usual. But otherwise feeling okay.

<p>
	I have tried vegan and vegetarian and it simply does not give me sufficient energy.
</p>

<p>
	You vegans don't seem to realize something: not all human genetics and bodies work on a vegan diet. That is an unquestioned assumption you hold.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you misunderstand Love. Since God is Love, murder is Love too. You cannot use the fact of Love to justify any action, because every action is Love.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible if you're really wise. But since most people are fools, they will have to hit their own face against the brick wall to learn the lesson.
</p>

<p>
	And the biggest fools don't even learn the lesson then. They might hit their face against that brick wall 20 times and still not learn. Some people would rather die than learn their lesson.

So many sheep people here and they don't even know what they are doing, why they are doing it and what's even there\what's possible. 95% of them were here for some lame reasons such as reducing their suffering, and then you're like - what the fuck? Where are all serious folks?

		<p>
			There was one guy on my retreat who was hardcore into psychedelics and who's done 40 days retreats in some Thai Monastery. Now this guy was quite the opposite, he quickly gathered quite an audience around him on the 10th "talk day". But these people are rare af. It feels so fucking lonely. All you face are just a bunch of normies who are maybe 10% more awake than a regular person from streets

<p>
	Because the most serious people don't need to practice in a group. A group is designed for lazy sheeple.
</p>

<p>
	If a person was serious she would just sit down and become awake. The rest is games.

<p>
	I don't dispute he helped many people.
</p>

<p>
	But when you practice spirituality like a monkey, there will be consequences. Most of Sadhguru's followers do not even know what enlightenment is conceptually, nevermind achieving it.
</p>

<p>
	It's yet another religion with all the classic problems.
</p>

<p>
	What do you think will become of that organization in 30 years after he dies? What horrors will it commit?

	But I've been to a Sadhguru event and his members are total sheep. They are just zombies. They don't think about spirituality for themselves at all and they worship him. It's pretty stupid. After he's dead it's gonna turn into just another religion/cult.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru does not teach his people to think critically, he just teaches them dogmatic techniques which they perform like monkeys.

	Why are you talking a substance if you don't trust what it is?
</p>

<p>
	You took 35mg of 5-MeO-DMT? And you are surprised it didn't feel good? At 35mg you're lucky you're not dead.

<title>Understanding Relativism and the Validity of All Perspectives</title>

<p>
	In the Absolute sense, nothing is higher or lower. But in a relative sense, things are higher and lower.
</p>

<p>
	Relative to survival and your personal well-being, you don't want to be QAnnon supporter. Being a QAnnon supporter is a problem relative to the QAnnon supporter's own worldview, because a QAnnon supporter's worldview holds that certain things are true and certain things are false. And one day the QAnnon supporter will discover that QAnnon violate his own standards of truth. It is not Leo who says QAnnon is false. It will the QAnnon supporter himself who will realize QAnnon is false. So the problem with QAnnon is that it is incoherent by its own standards -- it's just that the QAnnon fanatic hasn't realized it yet. When he realizes it, he will be in pain.
</p>

<p>
	Any perspective which is selfish, unconscious, hateful, and fear-based will ultimately be incoherent by its own standards.
</p>

<p>
	The only perspectives which are coherent are conscious, selfless, and loving ones.
</p>

<p>
	Now you could argue: "But what's wrong with having an incoherent perspective? It's that okay?" To which the answer is: it's okay so long as you're okay with the suffering that incoherence results in. If you are okay with anything no matter what, then there is literally nothing wrong with anything. But then you're also awake. So the problem is that you are definitely not okay with anything on matter what. You are triggered so easily.
</p>

<p>
	The perspective that you have two ass holes is not equally valid to the perspective that you have one ass hole. Because eventually you will have confront the reality that you only have one ass hole. So it does matter how truthful your perspective is. The less truthful your perspectives are, the more you will struggle and suffer. But if you are okay with massive struggle and suffering, then there is no problem.
</p>

<p>
	What you need to realize is that it is you yourself who is judging the results of your own perspectives. If you didn't judge your results, there would be no problems. But you judge your results very much, hence you literally create your own problems. A wrong perspective is not wrong because others say so. It is wrong by your own standards!
</p>

<p>
	For example, you might adopt the perspective that rape is good. But then when someone rapes your mother you will realize: rape is horrible. And thus you yourself will violate and condemn your own perspective. You will realize that your perspective was selfish and foolish. In this way you evolve. It is your own internal contradictions that lead to your ruin.
</p>

<p>
	It is not necessarily ego.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds to me like he is extremely strict and demands his students obey his extreme spiritual practices. And then to support those extreme practices he needs money of course. This is not necessarily ego, it could just be his very high standards for how to do spiritual work. Obviously has some extreme ideas about society collapsing and so forth. If you honestly believed that society will collapse into nuclear war within the next 10 years, you would probably behave as he does. Although he's fooling himself if he thinks he'll be able to survive nuclear war in Costa Rica. His ashram only survives thanks to money pouring in from the outside world.
</p>

<p>
	He's basically running a monastery over there. Monasteries are radical and extreme places. I can see why he would not put up with shit from normies. A Zen monastery will also be very strict and extreme. These kinds of places are only suitable for extreme, hardcore spiritual seekers. I think the problem is that his students don't realize what they got themselves into when joining. Living in an ashram is not suitable for 99% of people.

<p>
	Jokes and stories must be delivered with proper body language, state, energy, contextual awareness, etc.

	The words you say matter less then how you say them. Just parroting my story will not help you. You need to invent your own stories that fit your style.

<p>
	Not necessarily. There will not be any simple formulas for this kind of thing. People simply have very different personalities and minds. The complexity of variables is staggering.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Awakening will make your innate character and personality stand out more. You will be more "you" than ever. You will be more authentic and unique as a character.
</p>

<p>
	For example, as I had awakenings I noticed they actually made me less nicer and less outwardly cheery because I realized those were masks I wore for much of my life so that people like me. So I actually became more authentically me, but at the cost of people perhaps liking me less because I no longer wear the masks they want.
</p>

<p>
	You stop giving a fuck about pleasing other humans. Of course some humans will not like this, because they like to be pleased.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, just be true to yourself and let the chips fall where they will.

<p>
	So? I would rather have partial understanding of Hitler than no understanding.
</p>

<p>
	But also, there is such a thing as Total Understanding too. Understanding does always have to be partial.

<p>
	Consider the possibility that I simply value understanding for its own sake, and you don't.

<p>
	Because it is necessary. You just lack the consciousness and intelligence to see the necessity of children dying.
</p>

<p>
	Everything that exists is absolutely necessary and could not be otherwise.

<p>
	Reality is Absolute Perfection. The only problem is that your vision is clouded.

<p>
	Of course, but that's AFTER you deal with horror of it.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I love it! But if you're worried about solipsism being true, you probably won't love it so much.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			I'd like to know one thing, though - and this may be the most important question, after all - and it is specific to you - after such a realization dawns upon you, what gives you the eagerness and the capacity to Love 'another' in the relative sense?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't necessarily love anyone any more in the the relative human sense. My love is very metaphysical and detached. Most people would not even consider it love.
</p>

<p>
	It's very subtle. It's a deep inner love for reality itself, not towards any particular person or thing. Imagine if you will that you just fell in love with the idea of reality itself.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			To 'exist' in everyday life needs a strong foundation on the tasks of a dual nature, too - is it that you have removed the egoic desires that come with it?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Be careful what you assume about me. I have not removed all my ego or its desires. Still plenty of that left.
</p>

<p>
	I have never made any promises or pretenses about "removing all my ego / desires". You guys often fall into the trap of assuming this about me, and it's very misleading. You will be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
	The only different between me and you is that I understand what reality is. You don't. That's all. This understanding does not make me some magical special extra-good person. You will find plenty of humans who don't know anything about reality and yet are nicer and kinder that I am. I am a bit of a jerk, actually. I am not too empathetic and I don't care very much about people's personal feelings. Mostly all I care about is understanding reality. You may find this difficult to relate to.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	How can it be explained? In many ways I look at the world just as you do. The only difference is that I understand what God is. You do not.
</p>

<p>
	Again, it's a very subtle shift in perception. Nothing crazy.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Who says it needs to manifest in any way at all?
</p>

<p>
	Truth is Truth. Truth is not there to be used by you for anything. You just enjoy it. Maybe it helps you not take life too seriously.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Mostly no different than before. I just also know in the back of my mind that they are projections of my own mind.
</p>

<p>
	Most of my interactions with humans are transactional. I am not kissing the mail man when he drops off my mail. In fact, I don't even know his name.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Mostly I avoid humans. I'm not running around hugging everyone. I keep to myself and try to enjoy my life and work on my life purpose. I am not an extroverted person or a social person. Now, of course, I can still socialize if I choose to. But I have little desire to do so. You may be different. People have different personalities.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It could, but your ideas of awakening are too fantastical. Mostly nothing happens. You have some awakening and then go about taking out the trash. It's not like fireworks are shooting out of my dick every day.
</p>

<p>
	This is some good stuff! Thanks for sharing.
</p>

<p>
	Although I should add, I see plenty of egoic projection in some of these critiques. Students often become disgruntled for whatever personal reasons and need someone to blame and they are too ignorant to understand the position of a deeply mystical and God-realized person.
</p>

<p>
	My biggest critique of Sat Yoga is that I doubt there is a single person there who is woke other than Shunya. As you become his little sheep servant monkey -- you won't have the time to awaken. You'll be too busy pulling weeds from his garden.
</p>

<p>
	The way I evaluate the quality of an ashram is based on how much time they actually give you to meditate. If you only have 2 hours per day to meditate, that's a shitty ashram. If you get 10 hours per day to meditate, that's a great ashram. Before joining any community make sure you are not just being used as a source of cheap manual labor.
</p>

<p>
	Also, the large sums of money they demand, if true, is a huge red flag. That's one of the reddest flags of a proper cult. You should not be paying any spiritual guru tens of thousands of dollars.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's technically correct. However, you do not have enough time in your life to embody everything. You can only embody a tiny amount of what you can understand.
</p>

<p>
	And it is not desirable to embody Hitler. But you can still understand him within reason without embodiment.
</p>

<p>
	Embodiment will always be a subset of understanding.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to punch yourself in the face to understand that doing so is not a good idea.
</p>

<p>
	When you finish deconstructing deconstruction, you will realize that consciousness is Infinite Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	You think you can escape consciousness somehow, but you can't because consciousness is all there could ever be.
</p>

<p>
	You won't understand how I know this until you awaken. Until then you will be under the illusion that something outside of consciousness can exist.
</p>

<p>
	What I am telling you is not a theory or a speculation. It is 100% certain. This is the whole point and promise of awakening. It is 100% certain. No doubt is possible.

<p>
	Dude, your posts seriously lack nuance.
</p>

<p>
	If you keep going down this road of misunderstanding you will be asked to leave the forum. You are misunderstanding a lot of stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is a relative fiction. I share it with you guys as training wheels for making some bit of sense of the social and political landscape -- without which you would be lost like a baby in the middle of the ocean.

</p>

<p>
	When I was there I definitely got strong group-think vibes. They worship Shunya way too much. But nothing I saw was a cult. But then again, my exposure to them was only 1 week long.
</p>

<p>
	All of Shunya's behaviors that I observed were of very high integrity. And he clearly knows this shit. My biggest gripe with him was his constant apocalyptic talk. Everything is framed as mainstream society is about to collapse any day, and this ashram is the only island of salvation.
</p>

<p>
	The people I met there were very nice, but they felt like sheep, not deep critical thinkers.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, Sat Yoga is basically a monastery. So you have to set your expectations appropriately. Monasteries are hardcore and conformist places.
</p>

	Practical is just selfishness. Of course there are many people how have practical morality. The point of all morality is to be practical and to serve one's survival. But this doesn't make it true. It is a fiction.

<p>
	No two people in the world have the exact same morality. Which clearly tells you that morality is relative.
</p>

<p>
	Moral systems around the world and across time vary enormously.
</p>

<p>
	There are many commonalities because humans tends to have similar survival needs. Since morality is pure selfishness, people tend to be selfish in similar ways.

<p>
	The core problem here is that you fundamentally don't understand relativity. Contemplate what relativity is.

When you do, it will feel extremely solipsistic to you in a horrifying way.
</p>

<p>
	Talking about dreams is all fun and games until you realize you dreamed up your mother. Then you shit your pants and cry.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, a video on solipsism is planned. I am not yet ready to talk about it.

<p>
	No. The difference is that I understand that all morality is invented and relative and selfish whereas JP and conservatives do not.
</p>

<p>
	I fully admit and embrace that my morality is groundless. It is purely my personal perference and bias. My morality is not normative nor objective. Not so for conservatives.

<title>Fear vs. Caution?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/66400-fear-vs-caution/?do=findComment&amp;comment=909172</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>
	The difference is, fear is a charged emotion.
</p>

<p>
	Caution is not emotional. It's more of a cool, rational understanding and premeditated avoidance.
</p>

<p>
	If you are standing at the edge of a cliff, you could feel fear or you could not. But just because you feel no fear does not mean you must jump off. You could simply decide not to jump and you could take a step back to be sure a gust of wind doesn't blow you over. That's caution.

	The problem is, people who follow my work are not hardcore full time monks. So my work cannot assume that. Just by watching my work already admits you are spiritually lazy and not willing to work hard like that monk. That's just the nature of YT.

			So psychidelics will never get kundalini to sahasra but get u all the amazing god wisdom there is?
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Pretty much. Although for some people it could activate kundalini. But that is not its core purpose.
</p>

<p>
	If you boil spirituality down to just raising kundalini then you'll miss a lot of amazing stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are 1 tool in the toolbox.
</p>

<p>
	That's what my work is. My work is not designed to sooth your every need.

</p>

<p>
	A single video of mine might require a year of contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, this nihilism video is the result of 15 years of my contemplation and life experience. You could watch this videos for 15 years and still find new things in it.
</p>

<p>
	The stuff I talk about these days is very deep. Peole don't realize that. It will take most people years to realize how profound the ideas are.

<p>
	I don't think anything will. He is too attached to his human views of reality.
</p>

<p>
	He would need to deconstruct his whole mind. He is lost in the labyrinth of his own mind.
</p>

<p>
	Being more conscious than 90% of people is nice, but also not nearly enough to be speaking about God or Love.

The end.
</p>

<p>
	What you can dream is completely unlimited.
</p>

<p>
	As a newbie this will not help you. You need to do practices or psychedelics to become more conscious.
</p>

<p>
	If you want Truth you should be willing to burn every assumption to the ground. Including the assumption of other people.

<title>God Realization Video Question</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Imagine knowing EVERYTHING in the Universe perfectly.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how unexciting that is after a while.
</p>

<p>
	Do not take my words too literally. These are abstract pointers to things.
</p>

<p>
	If you were God you would want to be human. And if you were human you would want to be God. The grass is always greener on the other side. The finite seeks the infinite, the infinite seeks the finite. Two sides of a coin.

<p>
	No.
</p>

<p>
	But also what you will realize if you become conscious enough is that chakras are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Being really conscious and raising your kundalini are distinct and seperate things. You can have one without the other.

	His answer is pretty decent considering he isn't conscious that EVERYTHING is Love.

<p>
	His is a human sort of answer.

<p>
	You can't understand the answer without a profound God-realization awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Just the fact that you have such a negative attitude about solpsism already tells me that you are not ready for God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	You need answers but your cup is full.

<p>
	Your logic is your own. It does not apply to me or even most other people.
</p>

<p>
	Practically speaking people who seek the end of suffering will never reach it because it tends to be a selfish and needy motivation.
</p>

<p>
	If what you live for is to end suffering, I feel sorry for you. Your life is so narrow. And, btw, the best way to do that is to kill yourself. This is what the desire to end suffering usually leads to in practice. It rarely leads to God.

<p>
	Dude, if she doesn't answer your texts you certainly cannot call her and game her. Learn to take a hint. She's not going to date you.
</p>

<p>
	Do you have any idea how many guys hit on a hot cashier? She gives out her number to 20 guys a week. Without rapport a number means nothing. Stop wasting your time hoping to get lucky. Learn to build real attraction rather than trying to get lucky. A 9/10 girl will not sleep with you out of sympathy.

<p>
	Basically do the work to move up the Spiral Dynamics stages. As we all move up the stages stuff like racism, selfishness, hatred, judgment, violence, war, terrorism, corruption, etc will all dramatically reduce. We don't really need aliens to help us with that. I doubt they even can.
</p>

<p>
	Also, we need more material wealth and economic development. Much of the world is simply held back from developing themselves psychologically and spiritually because they lack basic safety and material conditions. You cannot self-actualize in a warzone.

			I’m really curious about this. Do you not see embodiment as a central aim of the process? Wouldn’t that be up there on the same level as pure understanding in terms of importance? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To me understanding is more important than embodiment because you cannot pursue embodiment without correct understanding.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're saying: the building is more important than the blueprint. But you cannot create a building without a blueprint. And the blueprint of the building is actually of a higher truth than the building itself. I don't care about the building as much as I care about the blueprint. Most people aren't like that. Most people just want the building and they don't care about the blueprint, because they are pretty selfish.
</p>

<p>
	This is not to say that embodiment is not important. It is important and I do care about it. But it is not the most important thing to me. Because you will always be able to understand way more than you will be able to embody. And not everything understood deserves embodiment. For example, I can understand Hitler without embodying him. Embodiment is a limited subset of pure understanding. If I place embodiment above understanding I would not understand many things because you simply don't have enough time to embody everything.

<p>
	Yes. I don't care about the end of suffering.
</p>

<p>
	I mean... I don't want to suffer. But ending it is not what excites me about life. My motivation for life is not negative, and I think people who place the end of suffering as their top priority are making a big mistake. To me, that is an act of selfishness.

			Just look at Owen, he has mastered some aspect of the social aspects in life. He is magnetic, extremely charismatic, knows how to "hang out" so that maximum number of people have a good time and probably knows how to say no, how to retreat.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's not just about dating that this works. Words can make somebody ruin your life, right words can cause your life, de-escalate conflict. Attract right kind of people. Socialy speaking, you are worth that what and how you are expressing. The streets got something for you. Either it can take everything from you and gice what you want. Have to be careful, sometimes it punishes your greed, somtimes your non-expression.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you were hostile to everybody, immagine how TERRIBLE your life would be, you would be on the street, because you can't properly relate to anybody, and on top of that, somebody would kill you for the smallest of things. So presenting yourself and enabling your self-expression is whats pick up seemingly can do, besides getting you laid, at least that's what tyler radiates.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course Owen teaches a lot more than just getting laid. But I was speaking about PUA as a whole. It is about getting laid. The rest is secondary in that community. Owen is a spiritual guy and he has lots of great ideas about more than getting laid, but he does not understand enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is: don't go to a PUA to get enlightened, as he will badly mislead you in that area.

	Obviously Julian does not understand enlightenment. Nor does anyone at RSD.

<p>
	Enlightenment is when you realize you are God dreaming up the entire universe, including death.

<p>
	Obviously don't be trying to learn about enlightenment from a PUA. That is not his function. His function is to get you laid.

<p>
	It is less of a deception than a dream or imagination game. Since nothing can exist but via imagination, if you want to create a solid feeling realty, the only way to do it is via a very juicy/powerful illusion.

<p>
	See... here is the problem with your explanation. No matter what was disclosed about aliens or consciousness or whatever, 99%+ of the people of this planet would still be deeply selfish, biased, and corrupt, and thus all those problems of ignorance you mentioned would not disappear. Your conspiracy theory paints this picture of elites holding back the rest of mankind, but this is obviously not the case because it is 99% of mankind which is so ignorant and selfish that it unwilling to act in conscious and loving ways -- and it is they who elect the leaders.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a problem of anyone holding mankind back, it is problem of mankind simply not being developed enough.
</p>

<p>
	If the majority of normies cannot handle watching an Actualized.org video, how can you expect them to listen to some aliens talking about peace and love? They would just call the aliens evil and want to destroy them.

<p>
	You should try to get as much rapport and time as possible. Very short numbers will flake 95% of the time. Don't pride yourself on getting numbers, pride yourself on getting dates.
</p>

<p>
	You should always push for an insta-date right where you approach her. Walk her to a coffee.

			But I have issues with feeling oneness with the impermanent, let's say.

		<p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Generally the progression is this:
</p>

<p>
	1) You realize no-self.
</p>

<p>
	2) You realize Nothingness/Emptiness/Formlessnesss
</p>

<p>
	3) Then you realize The Self.
</p>

<p>
	4) Then you realize Formless =  Form
</p>

<p>
	It does not have to happen in that order, but this a very common progression.
</p>

<p>
	You need more consciousness to see that Formless = Form
</p>

<p>
	You progressively realize deeper and deeper that everything is ONE. All dualities merge into each other more and more and more and more until it gets so radical that you literally cannot tell the difference between anything.
</p>

<p>
	It's a slow process of defragmenting the mind until your mind becomes a perfect Unity. You are healing and unifying old divisions in your mind like, self vs other, life vs death, love vs hate, good vs bad, reality vs illusion, God vs self, truth vs love, something vs nothing, relative vs absolute, etc. In the very end you realize that everything equals everything else.

<p>
	I'd like to create a list of all the various kind of religious and spiritual symbolism that is found in cultures from around the world. I think it would be interesting to see the diversity and also the similarities. I'm especially interested in exotic or less well-known stuff.
</p>

<p>
	If you post a pic, try to link also to some Wikipedia page or other source which explains the meaning of the symbol.

<p>

<title>Question to Leo regarding day game</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/66319-question-to-leo-regarding-day-game/?do=findComment&amp;comment=908254</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	You don't need to demonstrate much high value during day game. The direct approach itself is enough, plus your confidence, body language, and humor.
</p>

<p>
	And of course you will suck at all that when you start. But you will improve. Just start approaching. Things will tend to auto-correct the more you do it.
</p>

<p>
	Lying isn't really necessary. You can literally make up stories and tell her you're making them up. For example, you can start telling her about how you and she are sitting on a beach in Hawaii drinking pina coladas. You can be very imaginative and fantastical with your conversation such that you are just spinning funny future-stories of you two together. And then you're not lying, it's just fun conversation.
</p>

<p>
	If you want interesting stories to tell, you can also just read a magazine or newspaper every day before you go out. That way you got some fresh material to talk about every day. You can tell her stories of interesting things you read in a magazine.
</p>

<p>
	Metal Floss magazine is good for this: <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.mentalfloss.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	It's just random factoids and weird stories.
</p>

<p>
	You can also just come up with stupid stories to say. For example, I would often open girls with the following: "Hey, me and my friend are starting a new business. It's a nutrition bar company. We will make nutrition bars from used up apple cores, Chinese newpapers, and bubblebees. We're calling it Bzzzzz. You should invest in our company." I got my first girlfriend from that stupid story.
</p>

<p>
	When you say stupid things, they don't have to be real or true and they don't count as lies because it's a joke.
</p>

<p>
	#1 rule of talking to women: Don't be serious. The dumber you are, the better.
</p>

<p>
	Of course. Totally understandable.
</p>

<p>
	But on the other hand, if two people don't fit, it will break up eventually anyway.
</p>

<p>
	You should try to make it work, but if it keeps not working, at some point you gotta move on.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, if a girl gets emotionally upset at me for watching porn like in the movie clip above, she's not my kind of girl. I'm not saying she's wrong, I'm just saying I got different standards than her and I don't consider porn cheating. In fact, I would watch porn with her. To me it's just not an issue. But those are my standards. Of course some girls won't agree.
</p>

<p>
	Just get clear on your standards and values, and what you're willing to compromise on and what you're not. To me, a girl as needy and insecure as the movie clip above is a turn-off. I don't need that much drama in my life. That kind of emotional reaction is suitable when someone cheats on you, not over porn.
</p>

<p>
	What is God? << that's the key question to crack. Answers such as "awareness" or "consciousness" or "nothingness" are partially correct, but not good enough. Those are glancing strikes. You must hit the nail right on the head to reach complete self-understanding.

<p>
	Of course. It's just a matter of realizing this more holistically.
</p>

<p>
	Look at your hands. Your body is God. This is what God looks like. God has a human body.
</p>

<p>
	God is a singular being who creates itself using infinite imagination. You are that being pretending to be human.
</p>

<p>
	You are an Infinite Dreamer. YOU! YOU! YOU! No one else but you. Just look at what you dreamed up.
