<title>What's the deal with the moralization of sexuality?</title>

<p>
	Morality is a major survival function.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is a major survival function
</p>

<p>
	The two go hand in hand because sex is a very powerful force for humans. It dominates all of human life. This force is controlled and manipulated by the individual ego and the collective ego in order to maximize survival. Church and state both have a vested interest in regulating sex.
</p>

<p>
	Sex seems like fun and games, but sex is also a matter of life and death, especially for the woman. So she and her family must take it very seriously because her value in society is directly tied to her reproductive potential.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is worth a lot of money so egos will come up with all sorts of ways to manipulate it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, you can build entire empires with sex. People did and still do.
</p>

			We could be more intentional and actually more conscious people on board with helping. But maybe to change society as a whole we need to find more subtle ways to get under defense mechanisms. So, at least this stuff has a chance to enter someone's mind. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I've had thoughts in the past of making more conscious art and entertainment. This could be a subtle way to shift things. It could be deliberate but not "in your face".  With that, we can send loving conscious material across the airwaves. This is only one possibility.

<p>
	That's where spirituality intersects with life purpose. Your LP should be about helping mankind raise consciousness in whatever way you find more meaningful. That could be through film, social media, writing, music, art, business, politics, education, engineering, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing for now is to educate yourself further. A deep study should be made of Conscious Politics before you run off to start some political or social revolution.
</p>

<p>
	Once you do that AND you find your LP, then your whole life will be making an impact and helping to elevate people.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how Marianne Williamson is ridiculed as a hippie New Ager by the mainstream press and pundits.
</p>

<p>
	That's how people ahead of their time are treated by the mouth-breathing masses.
</p>

<p>
	She is certainly not electable today. And why is that? Because the level of consciousness of the majority of voters is too low to appreciate the level she is speaking from. So it will take a few hundred years of social evolution before her ideas become accepted as obvious and mainstream. In the meantime, over 10 million people will have to die for that lesson to be learned.
</p>

<p>
	And the biggest mindfuck of it all will be: once her ideas are accepted as totally obvious, no one in that future generation will believe that it could have been any other way. They will take it all for granted.

	If it advances any faster it will burn up in the atmosphere.

<p>
	You have to realize that this has been a very long-term project from the very beginning. Amazing stuff is coming. But you must stick around for years to see it all unfold.

			Let me just say I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't really feel GOD-like or anything, maybe I am just not ready or conscious enough or something but I can see why people say that DPT has a more "darker" tone to it then other substances. Let me explain...
		</p>

		<p>
			On the come up I was just laughing at everything. Then here's where the "darker" tone comes in. I remember at one point in the DPT trip it felt as if I was being possessed over and over again by different malevolent spirits telling me that I need to work on my sub communications towards people, because people can sense through my vocal tonality that there is no empathy there and that I need to have empathy in order for people to feel safe around me. I then just starting laughing like an evil maniac. I think for most normal people this type of thing would scare the shit out of them but honestly I was really enjoying getting possessed over and over again which I am not so sure if that's a good or bad thing lol. That was the the so called evil part of the trip

	You're clearly an advanced practitioner. That is great. Which is why I am nudging you to go one step further. Do not stop until you have a direct consciousness of why Creation is happening.

			Awesome video, just a note that might be helpful and seems contradictory with with what has been said in the video,
		</p>

		<p>
			from the book the Righteous mind by Jonathan Haidt, by comparison of data between questionnaires of leftists and rightwing voters,  he provides the results that Right wing people are more aware of the Left people's mindset and ideals, they just do not agree with them.
		</p>

		<p>
			However Left wing people, although considered more open minded fail to understand right wing and overestimate the conservatism of right wing, in their minds.
		</p>

		<p>
			That being said..... leftists are more solid in their opinions and fail to understand the Right wing to the core, when right wingers are far more aware but they strongly  disagree.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't find that to be true.
</p>

<p>
	1) Research shows that conservatives are consistently more closedminded than liberals. Conservatives are generally not interested in exploring other POVs. Liberals are more open to that and more tolerant of other perspectives. Of course not always so. Many liberals also become dogmatic. And many liberals especially hate conservatives and therefore misunderstand them.
</p>

<p>
	2) Spiral Dynamics research shows that conservatives are lower in their cognitive and moral development than liberals.
</p>

<p>
	I agree that we need more mutual understanding of all perspectives. Which is why I spend a lot of time studying conservative perspectives. But conservatives almost never do that. When was the last time you saw a conservative reading a book on Marxism or Feminism? It's laughable. They would never do that.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that conservatives merely disagree with socialism or post-modernism, for example. They fundamentally do not know what socialism or post-modernism is. Even highly educated conservatives like Jordan Peterson, who is a professor, do not have enough intellectual curiosity and objectivity to understand socialism or post-modernism. Liberalism correlates positively with higher education. Which is why conservatives like to ridicule and demonize universities and academia.
</p>

<p>
	I agree that most leftists do not understand the right wing to their core. But the right wing understands leftism even worse. Just go watch Fox News to see the proof.
</p>

<p>
	You're being too flippant about it.

<p>
	God doesn't just create willy-nilly. There's a profound WHY behind it. Why is not merely an egoic question.

<p>
	To answer this question is to resolve the entire mystery of the universe. And it can be done.

<p>
	That's rather a shame. There is a definite answer, if you'd only be curious enough to seek it.
</p>

<p>
	I'll tell you this: it's worth seeking.
</p>

<p>
	How is it that you exist but are not curious enough to know why you exist and what all this creation is for?
</p>

<p>
	The answer is not a blank.

</p>

<p>
	1) People interfere with tripping, even if it's just 1 or 2.
</p>

<p>
	2) The shaman's medicine doesn't have standardized potency and he has no idea how tolerant you are. He does not have the time to gradually test doses on you to find your sweet spot. But at home you can (and should) do just that.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not surprised at all that some people go to a shaman and freak out. Because you took way too big a dose too fast.
</p>

<p>
	Gradual dosing is KEY in this work. It's very easy to overwhelm yourself and scare yourself off from psychedelics forever. It's like raising a child. You don't expose a 5 year old child to the entire adult world in one shot. You have to gradually ease him into it, otherwise he will freak out and develop a pathology. You wouldn't show a 5 year old child hardcore rape porn or videos of terrorist beheadings. That would obviously traumatize him. This is what's happening to you when you dose too high.
</p>

<p>
	The mind of God can be a terrifying thing to those who are inexperienced with navigating it. Because it is so powerful. Remember, this mind is responsible for creating the entire universe. So yeah, expect it to be unbelievably, frighteningly powerful. It takes great maturity and purity of heart to explore all its nooks and crannies. It is like exploring the mind of a madman. You have to be slightly mad to want to do it.

The trail is twisted and goes through a deep briar patch. Keep sniffing it out until one day you'll find yourself looking straight into the face of God.

<p>
	Enlightenment cannot be explained by materialism or science whatsoever. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever that lady experienced, that was a drop in the bucket of Infinite Consciousness. Her explanations are but hallucinations within the mind of God. She is hallucinating neuroscience without realizing it. And everyone watching her is hallucinating her without realizing it. LOL

<p>
	Cermonial settings are less than ideal because dosage is unknown and the environment is chaotic.
</p>

<p>
	Trip at home on small doses and it will be good.
</p>

<p>
	Do 10-20 low dose trips to get yourself grounded and comfortable in the psychedelic space.

<p>
	It just won't make sense until you experience it for yourself.

<p>
	These advanced things cannot be formulated in words and they are beyond logic or scientific method. So without direct experience of it you're stuck.

<p>
	What you fail to appreciate is that cutting edge discoveries don't work that way. There is a long and grueling process to verify a thing beyond all doubt, doubly so when that discovery would upend your whole paradigm of reality.

<p>
	The US Airforce releases credible video footage of UFOs out running the world's best jet fighters and radar locks and you ignore it. So who's being stupid here?

Keep asking them of yourself as you contemplate, meditate, and trip.
</p>

<p>
	If your desire to understand consciousness is deep enough, eventually you should get the answers until everything becomes clear.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that you are imagining the entire physical world with all of its rules and limitations. So if some physical scenario (like your camera example) works the way it works, it works that way precisely because you imagine it that way. But you're not aware yet of how you're doing it. Notice that your confusion rises because you imagine that it (the camera) should work some other way. You imagine that way and then super-impose it upon your yet deeper layer of imagination of the physical world. So the confusion arises because you're imaging things at various layers and getting tangled up in them.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine there are other people and cameras who see things. Then you complain how come they don't see things as you see things. Because first and foremost you imagine they are separate from you. You gotta untangle the many layers of your own imaginings. Of course first and foremost you gotta realize that "you" and "imagination" are themselves entangled, confused, and imaginary notions.
</p>

It is not so simplistic as imagining a unicorn and it physically appears.
</p>

<p>
	Reality/consciousness has many partitions and levels which are hidden from itself. Just like a sophisticated operating system. The OS does not allow access to all of its parts willy nilly to any random app. There are permissons and layers of security to ensure the integrity of the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
	There are aspects to consciousness which are private and aspects which are public. This duality itself is imaginary though at higher levels of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of being an individual creature is that you have this private domain of consciousness to work within. You are master over your private little dimension. Or at least it appears that way to you because that's how you know you're an individual being. God had to imagine that for you. Now you want to blur those boundaries but you're still so busy being in a state of separation.
</p>

<p>
	What good would God's design be if I could imagine that your child is a dog and he suddenly turned into a dog? Can you see why such a design would be problematic? So as a human I am precisely not given such powers.
</p>

<p>
	All limitations and boundaries are purely imaginary, but as a human you are not given consciousness of how this imagination works -- for your own benefit. It's too much for most people to handle. Human life is on a need-to-know basis. God does not reveal things to you which you do not need to know. Unless you need to know them. Then all is revealed. Which is why a burning need to know is so important in this work.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can very easily be decieved by your own imagination by getting lost in it.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you can imagine a religion or a system of morals or a scientific model and then believe in it so strongly that you forget that you imagined it.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're a writer who writes a novel so deep and so fantastical that he starts to confuse it for reality. He starts to believe that his fictional characters and all their problems are real.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you are fully conscious there can be no self-deception. But the problem is few people are fully conscious because consciousness is so vast and deep.
</p>

<p>
	It's precisely because you are the ultimate authority that you can totally delude yourself. If you imagine with your full conviction that you are a Muslim or Jew or Christian, that will become your reality until death.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of consciousness is such that it can fully mesmerize you. Because it is singular and all-powerful.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so simple. There are many different facets to God's awareness. Sometimes you're aware of one facet but not another.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you have to sorta see different facets individually and then piece them together. There's just too damn much to see it all at once.

<p>
	I have thought about it long ago. It's great in theory. In practice, the issue is that it takes serious skill and understanding to properly structure such a Wiki without having it turn into devilry of all kinds. People will try to inject their person biases into the Wiki, devolving into a nonduality war over whose enlightenment is deepest and truest.

<p>
	No, it's because your mind is actively denying that such people are yourself.
</p>

<p>
	When you judge another human, you are separating them from yourself, which is fundamentally false.

	I also find it problematic that he does not explicitly talk about God either.
</p>

<p>
	He is God-realized but he keeps a lot of things unsaid.

<p>
	That is his style. He's very rigorous and detached. Very Zen-like, very masculine.
</p>

<p>
	It has its pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that he's not loving. He is a loving guy. But the problem is he doesn't explicitly teach it. The word love is not part of his vocabulary, which is a problem from my POV.

<p>
	He is an excellent teacher, but he is missing the most important and deepest aspect of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	I used to think I was crazy to think so, now I know 100% that he does not understand existential Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love and Truth are one. This realiziation is critical. It is the core of this work. Love is not merely a human emotion. Love is the entire reason for existence.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just Ralston, I notice now that many Eastern spiritual schools do not properly understand or teach Love. Zen and Buddhism are guilty of this. Even Vedanta to some extent doesn't teach Love properly.

<p>
	These are delicate molecules we're dealing with, so you definitely don't want to boil it or apply a flame to it.
</p>

<p>
	Just put a shot glass of water in the microwave for 20 seconds. It gets very hot. Then you can pour that onto your substance.
</p>

	If you stare long enough at the carpet without blinking your eyes, you will see it start to melt and wave around.
</p>

<p>
	You can also notice neon tips.
</p>

<p>
	I mean sober. Usually sober people just overlook psychedelic effects in their visual field. It is filtered out as irrelevant to survival. But it's right there under the surface.
</p>

<p>
	If I sit down and meditate for 10 minutes my carpet starts to wave.

<p>
	This is an attitude of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	The goal of this work is to surrender and accept ALL reality, not just the parts your ego thinks are "good".
</p>

<p>
	Let go of needing life to be any particular way. Then happiness is posisble.

<p>
	Scoops are very precise, but only relative to each substance. So each new substance you gotta start off with 1 scoop and work up to find your sweet spot.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's harder to share your dosages in this case.

<p>
	This is false.
</p>

<p>
	Insight goes beyond thought.
</p>

<p>
	But also thought can carry truth, and must itself be a part of Truth, otherwise it could not exist.

</p>

<p>
	It is possible she's telling the truth depending on the answers to the above questions.
</p>

<p>
	The deeper point is: why do you care? You are clearly way too invested in her.

<p>
	Ultimately the only thing that's required to reach the truth is a genuine, unwavering desire to know the truth -- not your ideas of the truth or what is convenient and pleasant for you, but the actual truth, whatever it is, whatever the cost.
</p>

<p>
	If you have that intention, then you will ultimately reach the truth. And anything shy of that will not take you to the deepest levels.

<p>
	Because the world of form is precisely identical to formlessness and nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	You are still thinking that the material world is somehow less than or different from nonduality. This is the final barrier which must be overcome.

	Being indepedent is great but women should also cultivate their femininity.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to out-man men. Rather charm people with your femininity. If that resonates with you. People fall all along the masciline-feminine spectrum. Find your place along it.
</p>

<p>
	Femininity is great! Strength can be either masculine or feminine.

<p>
	DPT is a monster. I've been able to access levels of consciousness that are simply beyond beyond beyond everything else.
</p>

<p>
	Beyond Advaita, beyond Zen, beyond Buddhism, beyond all teachings and teachers.
</p>

<p>
	You will never reach such levels of consciousness naturally through meditation or self-inquiry. No way.
</p>

<p>
	Ya'll do not understand how deep it goes. And there is no way to explain it.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way, why would God ask a human whether it is God?
</p>

<p>
	You see how indirect that is?
</p>

<p>
	If you are God, then realize that, be it, and forget about all the middlemen.
</p>

<p>
	The notion of a guru cannot withstand total nondual consciousness. Gurus do not exist at that level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason you care about gurus is because you aren't fully conscious that you are God.
</p>

<p>
	You can't get more direct than YOU. Anything else is indirect and insufficient to access the highest levels. The highest levels are 100% direct.
</p>

	I have contacted his booking agent a while back, but my guess is Joe's a busy busy guy so who knows if or when he will get back to me.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind Joe probably has dozens of guests booked months in advance.
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe he's just not interested in this sort of material. It may be a bit too deep for his audience.

He is no Jesus i agree but the US severely manipulates media to project false information about him because he is a powerful threat to the US core-rupted system. US have just as much if not more mafia/illuminati controlled corruption than Russia. I was into this stuff many years ago, i studied quite a lot on what happens "behind the scenes" but i haven't kept up to date as much because its quite toxic to focus on long term. Although, many things may have changed in a positive direction in the US, i still notice quite a handful of old core patterns that linger around behind the scenes.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is a quote from Putin i read a while back that made me start resorting to alternative media about him because these words were on pair with my own thinking and information i had collected over time when i was into this stuff and most of the information of the corrupted systems were released by people within the US themselves. Its usually the places that are most corrupt that more and more order and righteousness emerges from the chaos because where there is/was more suffering, is usually the ones/places who awaken first.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now here is that quote
		</p>

		<p>
			"We as a species have the choice to continue to develop our bodies and brains in a healthy upward trajectory, or we can follow the Western example of recent decades and intentionally poison our population with genetically altered food, pharmaceuticals, vaccinations, and fast food that should be classified as a dangerous addictive drug." - Vladamir Putin
		</p>

		<p>
			Anyone else would of been assassinated for this. I have observed many assassinations in relation to the words used above.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Putin is an authoritarian who kills and jails opposition leaders and journalists.
</p>

<p>
	You do not understand Putin or how Russia works. I was born there, I know how it works.
</p>

<p>
	He is the leader of the KGB. He is sneaky enough to convince you to rape your own mother. Do not buy his bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	If you oppose him, he will have your kids teeth pulled put with rusty pliers in front of your wife. That is how business is done in Russia. They do not mess around and they are sneaky like you wouldn't believe.

<p>
	Science's empirical observations are actually what make it useful and good. Where it goes wrong is in its interpretations of those experiences and especially in its big picture understanding of what it all means.
</p>

<p>
	Science is much more than raw data collection. Raw data collection is fine. But science goes on to make models and theories, all of which are extremely limited. Data collection is also highly biased by one's survival agenda and metapnysical paradigm. You literally cannot see data which your paradigm tells you cannot exist.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a thing is limited doesn't mean it is flat out wrong. It can still be useful. But at the same time it's also missing a lot of the big picture.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Understanding Recontextualization, where I address this point in detail.

	Human "mistakes" are the result of the freedom God gave you. You are free to make mistakes so that you could learn and grow. Otherwise life wouldn't have any stakes.

<p>
	If your life was perfect, it would be imperfect.

<p>
	God does not make mistakes.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is just too small to appreciate the Grand Design. You keep underestimating God's power.
</p>

<p>
	If God is infinite that also entails that it is finite, otherwise it wouldn't be infinite. That is the paradox of God. God is too all-encompassing and all-inclusive to exclude stupidity.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you hate and dislike, God loves! Including evil, stupidity, and limitation.
</p>

<p>
	You have to really appreciate what Infinite Love entails.

<p>
	That's a self-defeating statement. The official paradigm is materialism, which denies the paranormal.
</p>

<p>
	There are millions of cases of paranormal phenomena, but they are all denied by closed minds.
</p>

<p>
	Science itself has statistically validated paranormal phenomena, but mainstream science and culture is in denial about it. Because according to official dogma, it cannot exist. Therefore it does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be in 14th century Europe saying: offically there is no evidence the Earth revolves around the sun.
</p>

<p>
	It is the job of officials to enforce the status quo, not to reveal cutting edge truths. When you expect officials to provide you with cutting edge truths, that's where you go wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Everything official is old news.

<p>
	Yes, indeed. That's exactly what I said: all authority is ultimately yours. So why are you looking to gurus and scientists and politicians to tell you what is true, who you are, and what to do?
</p>

<p>
	The problem is you are not conscious that you created Minecraft.

<title>Authority and science</title>

<p>
	Science works on consensus of expertise which is based on authority.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot really be science without a community of people. One guy working in his garage is not enough to produce modern science. Science needs schools, journals, universities, labs, peer review, confrences, textbooks, grants, teamwork, common languages, paradigms, government sponsorship, common units of measure, a common metaphysics, testing, credentials, certifications, etc.
</p>

<p>
	99% of all the science you know is purely concepts and beliefs. This is true even if you are a world-class scientist.
</p>

<p>
	All of this makes science very disconnected from direct experience, leaving a lot of room for error and myopia.
</p>

<p>
	Just the fact that you think science is valid, true, respectable, and good -- notice that that's purely based on blind faith and indoctrination. You believe science is respectable because you were programmed by your culture to believe that. You have never actually verified whether science is a proper method for understanding reality.
</p>

<p>
	A belief is not an insight.
</p>

<p>
	To understand what an insight is you'd need to have an insight about the nature of insight.

			So you are saying that the 'life dream' can be manipulated (with sufficient spiritual mastery)
		</p>

		<p>
			What does this mean? Like can you levitate or bring out a tornado at will ?
		</p>

		<p>
			But except in ancient religious writings where people talk about 'siddhis' , and  'miracles' in christianity, I have yet to find any evidence  for such occurrence. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Or are you saying that even to witness these 'miracles' one's consciousness should be raised? 
		</p>

		<p>
			Generally people don't believe in the existence of miracles like the way people believe in the existence of gravity, so commonly they are not thought to be true. Why do you think, 99% have never witnessed these miracles, hence 99% people don't believe in them?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Siddhis are real of course.
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean you get total control over reality.
</p>

<p>
	There are serious limits for obvious reasons. We cannot have devils running around creating tornados.

</p>

<p>
	As far as we know, America's voting system is pretty good.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful that you don't misuse skepticism to do more harm than good. The point is not to doubt everything under the sun but to doubt those parts which are false. Doubting truth is like shooting yourself in the foot.
</p>

<p>
	Russia does not have a great leader. They have an utterly corrupt mafia state run by a crypto dictator. You have no idea how bad things are in Russia. Any politician there who seriously goes against Putin will get assassinated or jailed.

<p>
	That's a terrible idea to put into peoples minds. We want more people voting, not less.
</p>

<p>
	American elections are often very close, meaning that every vote is significant.
</p>

<p>
	Trump won due to about 70,000 votes in key states. Bush vs Gore was even closer.

<p>
	I have already endorsed Bernie so there's not much for me to say.
</p>

<p>
	My general advice on politics is: vote for the most conscious person who stands a chance of winning.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie has the most progressive platform and is the least corrupted by corporations and lobbyists. He also has the longest track record of being progressive. Many other progressives are only skin deep.
</p>

<p>
	Telling people who to vote for is sorta pointless because people will vote no higher than their own ego will allow.

	You cannot just blindly mix DPT with that stuff, it could be very dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	You have to take it clean, without any other meds or supplements or things. Otherwise you'll never understand what is causing what.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be foolish folks. Mixing research chemicals with random things is irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
	Do not mix psychedelics with nootropics unless you specifically tested to make sure it's okay.
</p>

<p>
	Test! Test! Test! Every little detail.

	For some people the plugging method itself seems not to work. Maybe because they have different bacteria or genetics or whatever.

<p>
	You need to test that plugging is a method that actually works on you, regardless of substance.
