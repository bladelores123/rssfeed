<title>What are existential issues?</title>

<p>
	Metaphysical issues as opposed to psychological or human-centric issues.
</p>

<p>
	For example, figuring out how to make money or get laid are not existential issues. They are merely the pursuit of your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Questioning whether money or other people are even real would be an existential pursuit.
</p>

<p>
	You may be having lots of sex but do you understand that you are having sex with an illusion?
</p>

<p>
	Of course you wouldn't. And that is precisely why you are a miserable suffering devil.

<p>
	See, you don't really want truth, you really want selfishness. Hence you do not have truth, you have selfishness.

<p>
	The problem is that the ego does not know what true happiness or love are. The ego's selfishness and falsehood is precisely what prevents true happiness and love.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	That is merely due to lack of proper theoretical foundation, lack of self-inquiry, lack of meditation skill, incorrect dosage, and lack of consistent tripping.
</p>

<p>
	How silly would it be if NASA sent one rover to Mars and then said, "Okay, we're done. But we're so confused about Mars." To understand Mars requires hundreds of missions. One mission doesn't mean jack. It raises more questions than it answers.

</p>

<p>
	Truth is much bigger than happiness. Truth is there even if you're not happy. Truth is the only thing you can count on in this evanescent world.
</p>

<p>
	You should want the Truth even if it means it will cause you great suffering.

<p>
	Psychedelics will definitely not wake society up auto-magically. Psychedelics do not eliminate the work, they thrust you deep into it. And most people have no foundation for how to deal with that.
</p>

<p>
	I do not push psychedelics on everyone. I recommend them only to serious self-actualizers, which is less than 1% of the general population.

	Now you understand why 99.9999% of people aren't enlightened.

	I have a video planned on this exact topic so you'll be able to verify your understanding then.
</p>

<p>
	But unless you've had a massive enlightenment you will not understand no matter how well it is explained.

<p>
	As leader of this place, yes, I make such decisions every day.
</p>

<p>
	This is not CNN where ignorance is given equal weight as truth in the name of neutrality.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately if you don't agree with a spiritual teacher's guidance you should find another teacher. The guidance is sometimes given sternly, without room for debate, because the spiritual teacher has a greater depth of understanding than you. He's doing it for your benefit even though your ego may not like it.
</p>

<p>
	It's in poor taste to think you know more than the teacher. In that case, why be his student?
</p>

<p>
	And this is not to say the teacher is always right.

<p>
	LSD is outstanding. For me it is second best to 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	But people will have various opinions because psychedelics affect people differently.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are not as simple as people think. You don't just pop a pill and get the same result. Results vary ENORMOUSLY depending on many factors.

<p>
	If it has to be explained, you don't got it. And no explanation will help you get it.

<p>
	There is a very definite explanation.
</p>

<p>
	But if you knew it, you'd cease to exist and be enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind cannot answer that question because it requires the realization that ego-mind is a fiction. Which means you die at that precise moment.
</p>

<p>
	So the cost of answering that question is your death.
</p>

<p>
	Still want to know?

	Otherwise bring a vomit bucket.

<p>
	Yes, seeking ideals is a big trap in this work. Eventually you're gonna have to surrender all of your ideals for the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately this work is not about becoming a great person or even being happy. It's about discovering what is life and how it works. When you get to the rock bottom of it your perspective on life will change so dramatically that you will even cease to think you were ever born.
</p>

<p>
	If happiness comes, it will be a byproduct of a deep understanding how life works.

	The Absolute in none other than all arising contingent phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is all that exists. If you can see it, it is the Absolute. Your toilet is the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	If look at your toilet real closely, for a long time, you will realize it is God.
</p>

<p>
	That's nonduality. Nothing is hidden or separate.

<title>&quot;Insight knowledge is non-conceptual knowledge, right?&quot;</title>

<p>
	Of course one can get stuck intellectualizing, but the Truth is also not as clear as most people imagine. The Truth is massive, vast, paradoxical, freaky, and so multi-dimensional so it can easily be glimpsed and misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
	Hence the scriptures and teachings have value. A good teaching will give you a framework for understanding the Truth and points out common traps.
</p>

<p>
	Very very few people access the Truth fully and clearly in one leap. It usually takes years of stumbling around and piecing things together.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that people turn the teachings into ideology without any direct experience or very limited direct experience.
</p>

Psychedelics can take you into all sorts of wacky dimensions of consciousness. You have to distinguish those from nonduality proper.

<p>
	There is escape from suffering. But the irony is that to escape requires lots more suffering so most egos don't want to do it.
</p>

<p>
	The ego will settle for pleasure if it can. And these days society makes that very easy.

</p>

<p>
	You cannot understand what the words Brahman or Absolute refer to because you have not yet reached a fully nondual state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Go self-inquire or meditate, and stop conceptualizing about enlightenment. Your conceptualizing monkey mind is precisely what stands in the way.
</p>

<p>
	Or better yet, try some 5-MeO-DMT because otherwise you are gonna waste years chasing your own tail.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics make this so clear.

<p>
	This is like asking how long it takes to become a millionaire. It all depends on how bad you want it and how hard you're willing to work for it, and how effectitive your chosen methods are.
</p>

<p>
	Most people will not become a millionaire ever. Because it isn't simply a function of time. To think of it as a function of time is very mistaken and will in itself ensure you waste years in fruitless practices.
</p>

<p>
	Your practice must be serious, genuine, and powerful. Otherwise you will easily waste 20 years meditating without ego death.

<p>
	They are not different enlightenments but one and the same.
</p>

<p>
	"Soul" refers to a subtle aspect of the individualized self. That too is eventually transcended into pure nonduality regardless of which path you take. "Soul" is a technical term. It refers to subtle states of consciousness. Nondual is beyond even that.
</p>

<p>
	Transcendence goes:
</p>

<p>
	Gross >> Subtle >> Causal >> Nondual
</p>

<p>
	You can (and should) be working toward a permanent nondual awareness. That is the point of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga can help with developing that.

<p>
	A lot of time by your self contemplating and journaling is necessary. And not just once. You must do it over and over again throughout your life.
</p>

<p>
	The LP Course covers this topic a lot.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is the social conditioning and childhood survival habits run extremely deep. It is hard to seperate them out from your genuine higher self motives and values.
</p>

<p>
	I am still discovering more authentic motives in myself after years of self-reflection and years of satisfying various needs.
</p>

<p>
	As you grow your motives will get purified more and more until they run clear like a bitter cold high mountain stream.

	I know very little about him, but I'd guess he's an outlier and won't fit well on the model. People with mental illness will usually be outliers and their behaviors and motivations would best be explained by studying abnormal psychology (which I rarely study).

</p>

<p>
	Everything must include nothing otherwise it would be less than everything, since nothing would be excluded.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to phrase it:
</p>

<p>
	Without including nothing, everything is incomplete.
</p>

<title>effects of accelerating use of communication and AI</title>

<p>
	In the end, I can't see technological advancement as anything but part of God's plan. You can never put technology back in the bottle. Reality is always evolving into higher and higher levels of complexity and integration. Communication technology -- for all of its evils -- is helping integrate the world.
</p>

<p>
	Evil and division win in the short term, integration and love win in the long term.
</p>

<p>
	The internet makes it easier than ever to learn about self-help, consciousness, and enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	As we become more integrated, war becomes less and less a viable solution to our problems. But of course new kinds of problems always arise. Maybe now it will be information warfare more than physical warfare.
</p>

<p>
	Then why entitle your thread "It can't be said you're God/Reality/Consciousness"?
</p>

<p>
	Rather silly to say so when you are in fact that. So there's no problem saying it.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, to say otherwise would be a lie.

</p>

<p>
	You might want to try some easier psychedelics first like mushrooms or LSD and work your way up.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging toad venom is not gonna work. Toad venom must be smoked.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is preferable to smoking for newbies. But you'd need to find a synthetic version of 5-MeO for that.

<p>
	Living in this dreamscape is all about striking a healthy balance.
</p>

<p>
	Being an Elon Musk workaholic is to be out of balance in a pathological way.
</p>

<p>
	Allowing unfettered carbon emissions is to be out of balance in a pathological way.
</p>

<p>
	Pragmatically you are being given guidance on how to maximize your consciousness, whether as an individual or collectively. It's hard to enlighten people when their houses are flooded and their children's brains are polluted with toxins.

<p>
	There's no magic pill. You must slowly build one good habit at a time.
</p>

<p>
	By trying to solve everything at once you end up not solving anything. Significant change takes months and years of work. You must build healthy, sustainable infrastructure in your life.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe start by moving to a healthier environment. Then build up from there.
</p>

<p>
	If you try to change too much too fast you'll just experience a terrible ego backlash. It takes time and patience to rewire the brain in a sustainable way.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	You do not need to think to understand language. The mind handles that automatically already.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you could be in a conversation with someone, speaking to them, while simultaneously meditating.
</p>

<p>
	Even speaking does not usually require thought.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking is far less necessary than most people think.

The techniques are quite different, although they both lead to the same place.
</p>

<p>
	I find Isha Kriya to be less potent. I assume this is by design. Sadhguru's teachings are very mainstream and he probably does not want to freak noobs out and get himself into hot water.
</p>

<p>
	I assume Sadhguru reserves his most powerful techniques for advanced students. He doesn't give it to noobs to reduce complications.

<p>
	It isn't. Consciousness is everywhere. But for the sense of you to exist, you've tricked yourself into thinking it is planted in that body. Without an ego consciousness would not feel planted in that body.

<p>
	Imagine a hard drive with many virtual partitions. It is always one hard drive but the virtual partitions help to create temporary sub-domains within the drive, which can be useful. The key is to always remember that the partitions are not real but imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness subdivides itself through imagination, because in truth there is only unity. Division can only happen through imagination. Kind of like how a hard drive cannot physically cut itself into separate parts, but it can partition itself virtually.

<title>Are we within a Mind?</title>

I have said it many times already very plainly: there is only one thing in existence: consciousness. The entire universe is one mind.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic and see for yourself that this is true.
</p>

<p>
	But you have to stop thinking of mind as happening inside a brain. Rather, the brain is happening inside a mind. The conventional definition of mind must be expanded.
</p>

<p>
	To say that consciousness is all that exists is identical to saying the universe is one giant mind, the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be two substances to reality because you'd need a third substance to seperate the first two, and so on ad infinitum. The substance is always ONE, regardless of what you choose to call it: awareness, consciousness, God, energy, etc. If your picture of reality has more than one substance, it is dualistic and wrong.

<p>
	God is not limited to your present limited experience. God is not solipsism, as you think.
</p>

<p>
	As far as God is concerned, it is EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
	But you still don't understand what that means because you lack the direct experience of God.
</p>

<p>
	The only solution here is to have a direct experience of God. You're not going to understand it using your mind, arguments, or proof.
</p>

<p>
	It is not necessary for me to see every object in the universe for me to know that I am every object in the universe. You are assuming it is. That is a false assumption.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to become conscious that you are all things that have ever lived or will ever live. For example, I once became conscious that I was the dinosaurs. I did not have to become a pterodactyl to do that.

<p>
	Yes, all of this sounds impossible.

There is no you! The you who thinks it is reading this sentence does not exist. You are a fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is happening without you. The idea of "a you" is being attached to that reality to create the illusion that it is happening to "a you".
</p>

<p>
	For a minute right now, try to totally eliminate any sense that reality is here for you, or is in any way related to your body. Eliminate the sense of yourself entiry. Look at the room you're in an imagine you were never born, but the room still exists exactly as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Eliminate every ounce of you-ness from experience. If you are still saying the words, "me", "I", or "my" you still aren't getting it. Those words refer to nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Or just take a psychedelic and it will be so obvious. Stop wasting time on ineffective methods. Psychedelics answer all questions.

<p>
	"Illusion", "reality", "existence", "God" are themselves categories.
</p>

<p>
	It all collapses into Absolute Oneness. Within this Oneness nothing can be distinguished. It is pure undifferentiation. It contains all things. Like how white light contains all possible colors of light.

</p>

<p>
	The situation is simple: Either there is Truth or there isn't. If there is Truth you want to know what this Truth is. Pursue the Truth regardless of whatever. Truth is Truth is Truth. If knowing the Truth is wrong then you shouldn't want continue living.
</p>

<p>
	Let nothing stand in the way between you and Truth. Period.
</p>

<p>
	Truth can only be found if it occupies #1 priority in your heart.
</p>

<p>
	What use if family if it means giving up Truth? Can you see that without Truth nothing else matters? Nothing matters if you cannot distinguish it from falsehood.

<p>
	A) Spirituality is full of traps no matter how you slice it.
</p>

<p>
	B) This problem is solved through studying diverse sources and having maps like the Zen ox-herding pictures and Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	The greater danger with the way you are presenting enlightenment -- as total mastery -- is that people will always fall short of the fantasy, including yourself. Which then produces guilt and suffering. What you are really talking about is totally emotional mastery, and that is VERY different than enlightenment. It is significantly harder and a lot of people can become very frustrated chasing that.
</p>

<p>
	This sort of all-or-nothing approach is counter-productive and fills newbies with fantastical ideas of becoming perfect human beings after awakening. The fact is, you will awaken long before you become a perfect human being. Because these are independent variables.
</p>

<p>
	By all means pursue mastery. But make a distinction between it and awakening.
</p>

<p>
	If your definition of enlightenment excludes Ramana Maharshi, Shinzen Young, Osho, etc. you might want to rethink your definition.
</p>

<p>
	Firstly, many gurus are not at stage Yellow integral cognitive development.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, it is against the guru's business and marketing self-agenda to expose you to 100s of diverse sources. It is in his business interest to create a captive audience, a monopoly.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, exposure to 100s of diverse sources was almost impossible before the internet age. Be careful not to take this for granted. These days you guys are spoiled rotten with 100s of sources.

These are two very distinct things. By making this conflation, as you say, no one is enlightened, because your definition of enlightenment has become an idealistic fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	There are many lines and stages of human development alongside many states and degrees of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality can be grasped at many depths, it has multiple facets, and the realization of all those insights will not automatically make you a perfect human being.
</p>

<p>
	The way we use the terms enlightenment/awakening on this forum is to mean: the realization of no-self, God, Infinity, or Absolute Oneness. That life is a dream. This can happen and you can still have all sorts of fetters, bad behaviors, and psychological stuff. In fact, that's almost guaranteed.
</p>

<p>
	We do not use the word enlightenment to mean, "The total purifcation of karma and mind", or total mastery.
</p>

<p>
	Total mastery is a pipedream for most people and will take you 30+ years of industrial-grade practice.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment occurs when one catches the Ox. Not at picture #10.
</p>

<p>
	This is why the ox-herding pictures and Spiral Dynamics are so useful.
</p>

<title>Can Emotions Be &quot;Wrong&quot;?</title>

<p>
	The solution to emotions is to observe them mindfully. But of course this takes years of practice.
</p>

<p>
	There are also emotions of the higher self which pull you up to spiritual pursuits. But they are often drowned out by negative emotions like fear, anger, envy, greed, lust, etc.
</p>

	The distinction between self/other is a concept, and it will collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Leaving only one thing: YOU!
</p>

<p>
	Your mother is a concept. In fact, she is actually you. You came out of your own vagina.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this freaky to realize. It can feel like you're all alone. That's right! God is all alone. But do not confuse this with solipsism.

	Part of the problem with Green is getting lost in relativity: "everything's relative so anything goes. Let's let criminals run loose and do whatever they want."
</p>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	All POVs have some partial truth, BUT not all POV are equally functional. Some POVs are really pathological, dangerous, and limiting to upward mobility on the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a more evolved and healthier POV than Orange, but Green still has its limits and problems.
</p>

<p>
	Your Orange friend is slightly more deluded than you. And it can be useful to point out his delusion to him.

<p>
	Remember that people below stage Green don't have much concern for environmental issues because their mind is preoccupied with more selfish things.
</p>

<p>
	So the root solution to climate change is to raise more people to Green cognitive development. Then, from that, the rest of the external solutions will follow.
</p>

<p>
	A Green populace will vote for green politicians and green energy.
</p>

<p>
	Climate change is really a problem of excessive Orange. As we can clearly see with Trump, who is in such denial about it.

<p>
	Let's start a list of the best music for listening to on psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously taste in music is very subjective, but try to post the best of the best here. This music should work well with psychedelics and tripping. Chill, moody, down-tempo, ambient, techno type stuff.
</p>

<p>
	There's lots of obscure psychedelic & chillout music that can be found on SoundCloud.
