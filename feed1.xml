<p>
	Be careful just off-loading the problem onto some magical AI or robots. AI and robots are not going to magically solve our problems. They will create as many new problems are they solve.
</p>

<p>
	If robots ever get good enough to replace teachers, humans will be in trouble.
</p>

<p>
	At that point, what is the point of educating humans? Just replace humans with robots.

<title>A funny policy proposal // Asynchronous voting</title>

<p>
	Lots of problems with this model.
</p>

<p>
	How would a new political candidate ever get noticed? Voting would be reduced to a perfunctory process which few people would get engaged in. It would be hard to build a consensus for anything new progressive policy proposal.
</p>

<p>
	It's important that we have national debates and conversations about which direction the country should go in. At least election cycles allow for that. Clear cut election cycles make people more engaged I think. Otherwise everything will get muddled and luke-warm. It will be hard to even know who's in office.
</p>

<p>
	It would be better to just make voting day a national holiday.
</p>

	All relationships end. Most a lot sooner than you imagine.

<p>
	The reason you relate with people is mostly out of selfishness and to fulfill your survival needs. You ain't doing anything intelligent or sophisticated with your relationships. It's very basic survival stuff. The equivalent of pumping gas in your car.

<title>A Model for Free Global Education (Massively Online)</title>

<p>
	In practice this isn't good enough. There are many online universities already. But most of them are crap. Education involves a lot more than reading books or watching videos. There is a social engagement aspect to it which you cannot replicate online. And just the fact of showing up to a physical classroom is important for motivation.
</p>

<p>
	You can't just sit behind a computer for 12 years watching videos and clicking buttons. This kind of education will produce an army of incel trolls.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org works because it's supplemental. It already assumes you've go a solid base of education to build on top of. And even so, this work would be 10x more powerful in person. But I'm not about to run a physical university for thousands of people, so videos are good enough for the stuff I teach. But even so, most people who watch me are not serious students. They just watch videos randomly and get little results. You can't compare watching videos to a serious in-classroom education. Although of course the content of my videos is more powerful than any university curriculum. The videos are good for me because they allow me to reach a lot more people than I otherwise could. But the downside is my videos will only work on those people who are serious, self-motivated, and self-disciplined. Also the stuff I teach wouldn't be acceptable in any institutional setting, so online is good for that.
</p>

<p>
	Online is a great learning platform, but only for those who are already serious about learning.
</p>

<p>
	I could not be where I am today without the great in-classroom education I got as a teen.
</p>

<p>
	Before we deal with the problem of evolving education to the next level we first have to deal with the more basic problem of providing everyone with education.
</p>

<p>
	Actually, herding billions of children into classrooms is necessary. At least at this point in our evolution. It's got some downsides, but don't forget the massive upsides.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to criticize education. But how would you make it better? And remember, your solution must scale to billions of children. So some fantasy of having children running around in the grass doing whatever they want is not gonna fly. You'd need to design a system which scales to billions of students, is better than the current one, works within realistic budget constraints, and is politically acceptable to most parents. That is a very difficult design problem. Which is why we have the current system we have.

<title>CONFUSION: JP helpful for moving into yellow?</title>

<p>
	Just keep in mind that few people are solidly Green. Many people who lean Green in theory still have huge gaps in their development in practice. They are missing healthy aspects of Blue & Orange, and might have developed Blue and Orange shadows. So in this sense there can be value in learning from quality healthy Blue & Orange sources. This can help round out one's development.
</p>

<p>
	The danger is, if your Blue and Orange sources are impure or dysfunctional (which many of them are), you will tend to adopt their dysfunctions as your own.
</p>

<p>
	If you listen to JP enough you will likely adopt his dysfunctions, confusions, and shadow. He is not a pure source of wisdom. But you can learn from impure sources. You just have to extra careful.
</p>

<p>
	In fact the best way to learn from JP would be to study his impurity. But that is NOT how most people learn from JP.
</p>

<p>
	Studying impurity is an excellent learning technique. Too bad so few people know how to do it. Studying impurity requires being able to discern God from the devil. Which few people know how to do. If you were able to discern God from the devil, you probably wouldn't need to listen to JP.
</p>

<p>
	What Actualized.org teaches you is that you shouldn't see anything as bad.
</p>

<p>
	Or more precisely, realize that "badness" is a projection of your mind. If you think a thing is bad, it becomes bad from your POV.

You need to flirt with her in those 30 second periods every day. Make her laugh and smile. Try teasing her. Then you can ask for her number.
</p>

<p>
	The first girl I dated I met this way. Except I was the one coming and going while she worked at the reception desk. She actually started to flirt with me in those 30 second windows. After two weeks of flirting I asked for her number, she happily gave it, and we went on a restaurant date.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there's no guarantee she will be open to your flirting. Or she just might have a boyfriend or husband already. Check for the wedding ring first. Then just flirt with her assuming she doesn't have a bf.

<p>
	Those aren't healthy fears. You got some toxic beliefs to drop.
</p>

<p>
	Women do not blackmail men for sleeping with them. LOL
</p>

<p>
	You are projecting your own twisted mind onto women.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you sleep with a woman enough it will get serious and she will want some commitment from you. The mistake is trying to avoid that. Rather embrace it. Or then don't sleep with her more than a few times.

<p>
	Nothing is ever wrong. But everything has consequences.
</p>

<p>
	All attachment will bring suffering. Everything that goes up must come down.
</p>

<p>
	But you can't really learn that lesson without living through it. So knock yourself out with romantic infatuation and see where it gets you.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to be exceptionally wise and spiritually gifted to transcend such things without touching them.

	You've already posted about this in your impeachment thread.
</p>

<p>
	Also mind your biases and ideology.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a forum for arguing about ideology. This is a forum about reflecting on and letting go of one's ideology.
</p>

<p>
	If you keep posting with an ideological tone, you will end up banned.

<title>Concern Regarding Free Healthcare, Free College, and Taxing The Top 1%</title>

<p>
	1) By having free universal care there will be far less need of emergency rooms. Right now emergency rooms are overworked because people can't afford basic preventative care. If your condition is not an emergency they can just tell you to see your doctor the next week.
</p>

<p>
	2) Leaving is not enough, you'd have to renounce your US citizenship. If you want to renouce it, go ahead. But then you forego the benefits of being an American and in a sense you literally have betrayed your own country for money. Some will do that, but most won't because they are too attached to living and doing biz in the US.
</p>

<p>
	3) Your same argument could be made for public schools. Yet schooling is the one thing that keeps humanity out of barbarism. Free college also includes vocational training programs. So if you want to get training to become a pumbler or whatever, that's covered. So free college is not just for nerds or intellectuals. No one is talking about making Harvard free. Only public universities would be free. Private ones would still cost a lot. But they would now have to compete on cost with good free public schools like UCLA, UC Berkeley, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to establish a nice baseline standard for all citizens, so nobody gets totally fucked for life, the way it happens now.
</p>

<p>
	You're not getting it.
</p>

<p>
	The how is that there is no how.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying it's impossible to know how.
</p>

<p>
	I'm saying it's possible to know exactly how, and that how is magic.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to understand any of this without some reality-shattering awakenings. Psychedelics are your best chance to understand what is being said. You are not going to understand it in your current state of consciousness.

<p>
	All that's required is for people to go out and vote.
</p>

<p>
	There's a good chance Biden will crash by the time primary voting happens. Most people are not paying attention yet. Warren and Bernie both have good chances of beating Biden.
</p>

<p>
	This is exactly how democracy should work. Lots of good candidates to choose from.

<p>
	Ironically your awakening is incomplete so long as you are trying to escape experience.

<p>
	Sit back and enjoy the show. There's nowhere to go and no need to escape experience/form since it's no better or worse than non-form.

	Don't squander the gift of life.

<p>
	Once life is over, then you'll naturally be formless. So you will get the best of both worlds.

	There is a rare condition which causes some people not feel pain. Such people end up dead before adulthood.
</p>

<p>
	Pain is there to keep you from doing stupid stuff which would ruin your body. If God didn't invent pain, you'd be long since dead.

	Oh, it's gonna get a lot worse. This is only the tip of the iceberg of Trump's criminality.

<p>
	If the public only knew how much criminal stuff Trump has done, they would come for him with pitchforks.

<p>
	Trump has been skating on thin ice for years now and he's about to fall through.

<p>
	It's a good video. Makes some good points.
</p>

<p>
	I wonder though how bad a nuclear meltdown can get, and how bad a leak of nuclear waste can be once we have a 1000x more nuclear plants.
</p>

<p>
	Chernobyl and Fukushima might be the tip of the iceberg. If some nuclear plant leaks all of its waste into the ocean, how bad would that be?

<p>
	Of course vaccines were good for mankind overall. I don't think anyone disputes that.
</p>

<p>
	The question is, how do we make them even better?
</p>

<p>
	Yes, gasoline cars were very helpful for mankind.
</p>

<p>
	But now it's time to upgrade to electric cars which should come with less harmful side effects.
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem is, even if vaccines save 10 million lives for every 1 life they destroy, if you're the mother or father of a child who will get destroyed, you're not gonna take it quietly. Statistics are no consolation when your luck runs out.
</p>

<p>
	I don't understand why all-organic vaccines can't be produced. Do we really need mercury in there? Or is that just some cost-cutting measure?
</p>

<p>
	Self-transcendence is just the final step in Maslow's pyramid. One step above self-actualization.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make self-actualization and self-transcendence at odds with one another. They work together.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, to fully actualize yourself you must fully transcend yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The first half of this journey you spend actualizing your human self.
</p>

<p>
	The second half of this journey you spend actualizing your God Self.
</p>

<p>
	#1 leads to #2. And then #2 undoes #1. It's hard to undo #1 until you do #1. Most people need a lot more work doing #1 before they can even entertain #2.

<p>
	How could God not be curious about itself?
</p>

<p>
	God is too amazing and too mysterious to not be curious about itself.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you went to sleep in your bed and then magically woke up the next day on an alien planet. You would naturally be extremely curious to explore it. You wouldn't wake up and be like, "Oh, it's just some alien planet. Boring! I'm going back to sleep." Instead you'd say, "OMG! WTF is this? Let's look around. This is amazing stuff!"
</p>

<title>The fear of being surpassed intellectually</title>

<p>
	That's a very good insight about your fear.

			For each new insight, I feel like I'm growing and seeing things more clearly. So I feel like I can never get enough. The hunger is insatiable. But at the same time, there's this fear of not doing it. And that makes me wonder what lies on the other side. It could be growth, or it could be stagnation. It seems like I just have to take the plunge in order to find out.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But you must take it deeper. What is it about your identity which allows this fear to have any teeth at all for you?
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you've somehow made intellect an significant part of your identity (of who you think you are). So you fear losing that sense of intellectual self.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate that. Try to get more clear about it.
</p>

<p>
	And of course you know the ultimate solution here will be to surrender that intellectual self. You must bite the bullet that you will have no intellectual advantage over anyone else. At first you will resist accepting this because it will feel like a serious loss of meaning. You will feel like your life will become worse as a result. It will feel empty. But that emptiness is Truth. That emptiness is the True Self which you are avoiding. That emptiness leads to liberation.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, a big part of waking up is surrendering meaning. Especially those things in life you find most meaningful, which for you probably means the meaning which comes with intellectual pursuits and knowledge acquisition. Notice that knowledge acquisition is a subtle form of greediness and materialism. Like the businessman hoards money the intellectual hoards ideas and insights.
</p>

<p>
	Hoarding of ideas and insights must ultimately be surrendered to attain the final liberation. Because your truest Self is more empty and insubstantial than an insight or a piece of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	Of course don't make the mistake of demonizing or rejecting insight. Just don't build an identity out of it. That's all.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment makes you realize that genetics is a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	But relatively speaking, basically everything causes epigenetic change. So that doesn't mean much.

<p>
	Hehe, after the deep topics we cover here and with psychedelics, therapy will seem like child's play.
</p>

<p>
	The only way it could work is if you find a REALLY good therapist, not the typical hack.

<title>How to conquer fear of death on psychedelics?</title>

<p>
	Obviously you guys are still too afraid.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is conquered by facing it.
</p>

<p>
	See my recent videos on fear.
</p>

<p>
	You got a lot more tripping to do and inner work to do before your mind is ready to surrender. You're in just the early stages of this work. So just keep chipping away at it.
</p>

<p>
	Try to not think of it as death so much. Death is not real. Reframe it as waking up to yourself as God. This will make it less scary.
</p>

<p>
	If you watch Part 2 you will see I said exactly that: all fear is fear of one self. Which is to say, all fear is fear of one's own mind.
</p>

<p>
	All those "external" things you fear are your own mind which you have disowned.
</p>

	Kriya yoga is good for this. It's less mental and more physical.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try using binural beats as training wheels to build yourself up.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation is very difficult in the beginning.

	Philippines is a very stage Blue country. Stage Blue is too traditional and conformist to understand homosexuality. Stage Blue is very sexually repressed.
</p>

<p>
	You guys will argue about the issue for 50 years until you finally accept it as normal, just like all modern 1st world countries have done. And when you grand children look back on it, they will wonder what all the fuss was about.

<p>
	I don't have any formal practice right now. I just live life and try to be conscious.
</p>

<p>
	But this is not good advice to follow for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	Your practice will change depending on where you are in your path. So be careful comparing yourself to others. Find what you need right now.

<p>
	Nonduality is not a belief.
</p>

<p>
	Bad trips on DMT are no different really than good trips. A bad trip is nothing more than the tripper getting scared of his own shadow. If you take too much DMT too fast you will scare yourself, of course.

		<p>
			Hello.
		</p>

		<p>
			After 18 months of self-actualization which includes <em>meditation on a daily basis, reading, writing, mindfulness</em> and so forth, I still have a <u>deep</u> inner resistance when it comes to studying and trying to memorize facts.
		</p>

		<p>
			What I find strange is the fact that I can meditate pretty well and I can stay in the present moment for a long time without resistance. I have to admit that it was hard to reach this point where I can meditate everywhere, even at my work which is a pretty randy place.
		</p>

		<p>
			What bothers me is the feeling that I'll never be able to achieve a pleasant state (meaning a state of flow) when I'm studying the things that seem interesting to me.
		</p>

		<p>
			I want to be able to enjoy studying without resistance because it's very important for me to be a life-long learner. How can I become a good communicator if I'm not able to process and assimilate information very well?
		</p>

		<p>
			How many of you do have this inner resistance when studying?
		</p>

		<p>
			How many of you lack motivation when it comes to learning new stuff?
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm almost at a point of desperation and I mean that.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any suggestions to achieve a state of flow when I need to learn new information?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are getting in your own way. Your own ideals of being a good learner is precisely the thing which is tripping you up here. You are not allowing yourself to fully immerse in the flow of learning because you're too busy trying to live up to the image in your mind of being a good learner. This imagine creates all sorts of artificial requirements like memorization and other formalities which you then resist.
</p>

<p>
	Try learning in a less structured or rigid way. If you really enjoy learning, just do it. Learn in a joyful way without worrying about how that has to look. Perhaps memorization is not necessary at all. Perhaps finishing every book from cover to cover is not necessary either. Perhaps there are totally new ways to learn which you are not even allowing yourself to explore because you've got some rigid image in your mind of what learning has to look like. For example, maybe real learning might look like taking a vacation to another country and going to a bar for drinks with some new people you met, rather than sitting at home memorizing a book. Perhaps real learning is taking psychedelics in the middle of the jungle.
</p>

<p>
	As you go deeper into self-actualization work you have to find ways of doing it which feel organic and natural to you. It can't be like following some check list of mechanical rules.
</p>

<p>
	Telling yourself that "I must watch more self-help videos" will create resistance since its such a forced way of doing things.
</p>

<p>
	You must learn to listen more to your feelings rather than to your shoulds & rules. Your feeling tell you what you need to do when. But this requires getting attuned to hearing their subtle cues. For example in your case now your feelings are telling you that your method of learn is too artificial and forced, which is why you're frustrated.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I forced you to have sex every day and if you didn't have sex at the times I wanted you to, in the exact ways I wanted you to, I would give you a strong electric shock. This would quickly take all the joy out of sex. After a few months of this you'd start to hate the idea of sex.

<p>
	The democrats HAVE found ground and they have made a ton of serious policy proposals. Trump has no serious policy proposals other than anti-immigrant ones.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be making false equivalencies.

<p>
	The democrats have some of the best and most progressive candidates running in the history of the US. What more do you want? George Washington to crawl out of his grave and join the democratic debates? As soon as he learns about Trump he would crawl back into his grave and stay there.
</p>

<p>
	If people are stupid enough to vote for Trump a second time, nothing can save us. That ain't the democrats fault.

	How do you know? What if it is?

<p>
	What if your body is imaginary? How would you tell the difference if all you've ever experienced your whole life has been imagination?
</p>

<p>
	What if the very thing you think is real has always just been something you've been imagining to be real?
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine a thing to be real, does that mean it is real? Or is it still imaginary?
</p>

<p>
	How would you distinguish between you imagining something to be real vs it actually being real?

	It's not a challenge. I have always recommended moderate dosing of psychedelics.

Right now it seems like the MSM is coalescing around Warren and she's picking up a lot of the failed centrist candidate's voters too, while Bernie is being deliberately ignored. I saw a while ago you betting someone that Bernie would win the election, and I feel silly for saying this but this is what I've been basing the last few months of my political analysis around. Now, I'm not so sure. What do you make the situation?

<p>
	It's certainly possible that Warren steals his votes.
</p>

<p>
	I see a big problem with Warren and Bernie splitting the progressive votes, giving Biden the nomination.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind that it's too early right now. Polls don't mean much yet.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie will win the election against Trump. But will he even get to face Trump? That's a big IF. Biden and Warren are both stronger than I hoped in the polls.
</p>

<p>
	When I endorsed Bernie I didn't even know Biden would run. I was hoping he wouldn't. Biden really has no business running in this election. He's clearly just doing it because he's got nothing better to do.

<p>
	The desire to manipulate reality to suit yourself is the very definition of ego.
</p>

<p>
	But also, you are able to bend many rules as you become more conscious. You just have to appreciate that your personal human desires are not what governs the universe. There is a deep intelligence to how everything is arranged, so think twice before imposing your human ideas on how the universe should be.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe one day you'll discover that everything is perfect exactly how it is and that nothing needs to be manipulated. Imagine that! What a concept!

<p>
	I wouldn't call that racist. Politics is tricky and many politicians aren't able to keep their promises for reasons other than racism.
</p>

<p>
	Wearing costumes when abroad is fairly typical for leaders.
</p>

<p>
	Racism is a pretty serious charge that requires solid evidence.

<p>
	I don't know of his "racist actions" besides the face paint. By all means share if you have some evidence.
</p>

<p>
	I'm much more open to hearing about actual systemic racist policy vs face paint. I prefer to criticize politicians on their terrible policies than personal gaffs.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is a bit of an exception because he is so clearly a morally bankrupt devil. But even Trump I have compassion for. He's doing the best he can.

			So, it's not just as simple as smudging some make-up on their face. These mocking behaviors are actually very harmful and perpetuate all kinds of stereotypes. And if we give it a pass (especially from a world leader) and open the door for this type of behavior, other more serious forms of racism and willful forms of racism will take more of a foothold in society.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I agree that racism is still a problem.
</p>

<p>
	But I don't think it's right to ruin Trudeau's career for make up he wore to a party 15 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	I feel the voters of Canada can sort that out. It's been made public so now people can render their verdict at the ballot box.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget there are worse candidates in Canada than Trudeau who might win if he is tarred and feathered out of town. Canadian nationalism seems to be on the rise and a Trump-like Canadian president is not out of the realm of possibility, who would make Trudeau look like an angel.

<title>Is it wrong/ inauthentic to approach someone just because you feel lonely?</title>

<p>
	Dude, don't be so hard on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel lonely there's nothing wrong with finding some people to socialize with. In a sense that lonely feeling is telling you: "Hey dummy! You should socialize more!"
</p>

<p>
	What's inauthentic is desiring to socialize with someone but then not doing it out of fear that they will reject you. The authentic thing would be to walk over and say, "Hey, I was looking for a new friend and I saw you. So here I am. Please don't reject me or I will have to hang myself in my mother's basement with her vacuum cleaner cord."
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>BE MORE VULNERABLE WITH STRANGERS!</u></strong>

<p>
	There's not really much to discuss here. Try various techniques and discover what works best for you.
</p>

<p>
	And just keep an open mind that what works best for you will not necessarily work best for others. People's minds work in very different ways.

<p>
	That's technically true. But it's highly misleading.
</p>

<p>
	When I applied to CalTech by in my high school days I called them to ask what GPA I need to get in. They told me, "We have no GPA requirement." That's technically true. You can apply with a 3.5 GPA. But if your GPA is below 4.0, you ain't getting in. So be careful about kidding yourself.
</p>

<p>
	There are definitely things you can do to increase your odds of enlightenment. If this wasn't true, your teachers would be out of a job. Ralston holds enlightenment workshops. Obviously because he believes this increases your odds of enlightenment.

<p>
	Such things are not mere entertainment. They are part of this work.

<p>
	Be careful about holding language as contradictory to Truth or awakening. Awakening can infuse itself into language. Some great spiritual texts have been written and channeled. And they ain't just stories and BS. There is serious truth and wisdom in them.

<p>
	For example, it is possible to communicate directly with God. Of course this will involve language.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well of course that can happen. As Ralston said, you can get enlightened while falling in a bathtub.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of random shit can happen. If you facilitate 1000 students some of them will accidentally get enlightened by picking their nose. But that's a red herring. That doesn't mean you should bank on "picking your nose" to enlighten you.
</p>

<p>
	Not all spiritual techniques are of equal efficacy. Some are really really ineffective. So my point is, find what is most effective for you.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are unique is that they are exceptionally effective. Same for meditation & yoga.
</p>

<p>
	Watching cartoons is not effective. Although even that could work once in a billion people.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston is also wrong. It is possible to invent a method for enlightenment (at least a temporary one). And 5-MeO-DMT is it.
</p>

<p>
	To call 5-MeO-DMT a mere change in state is very very misleading. Make sure you do it before you say such things. And it's not good enough to toy around with it. You gotta seriously do it. You gotta hit a breakthrough. I'm tried of people talking about 5-MeO who have not had a breakthrough. Trying a psychedelic don't mean shit. You gotta have that breakthrough. Lots of people have tried meditation but that doesn't mean anything. Trying it is not good enough. You must actualize its full potential. And that requires some serious effort, not a casual experiment.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind there are some people on whom 5-MeO-DMT seems to have no to little effect due to their genetics or whatever. So their dud experiments don't count.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston's teachings are very advanced and most of you will simply not be able to actualize what he is talking about. So watch out. There is good reason why spiritual techniques were invented. Most people need them.
</p>

			I’ve met and have friends now whom are deeply enlightened and have taken psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT for example AFTER their own enlightenment and it’s the same answer every time “it’s a cosmic <b><u>state</u></b> of ignorance. This isn’t enlightenment.” That speaks WAY more than people taking substances and experiences crazy states whom aren’t enlightened and never even had enlightenment experiences thinking that they now know what they’re talking about. This isn’t to say psychedelics are not helpful for human stuff like healing, emotional work, psychological work, getting past certain issues. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You're not quite understanding how psychedelics work.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>There is nothing but states of consciousness.</u></strong> So you cannot escape states of consciousness since consciousness is the only thing that exists. There are just many different states and then there is understanding of how consciousness works.
</p>

<p>
	The point of a psychedelic is not to put you into a crazy state of consciousness per se. It's to reveal how consciousness works.
</p>

<p>
	The practical reality is that your state very much affects what you're able to become conscious of. If you're stuck in a bad state, you're basically fucked. You will not be capable of doing what Ralston says. In fact, basically no one is capable of doing the stuff Ralston says because their state is inadequate.
</p>

<p>
	The point of meditation and yoga is to permanently up your state so you have a reasonable chance of doing what Ralston takes for granted you can do.
</p>

<p>
	Although enlightenment is not directly limited to a state, one's state is really important for success in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck getting enlightened while you're in some PTSD state, depressed state, or opioid addicted state.
</p>

<p>
	States run your whole life. So dismiss states at your own peril.
</p>

<p>
	It's very different because on the one hand you have a serious climate catastrophe which is being made worse through denial and indifference. On the other hand you have Trudeau wearing some brown face paint at a dress up party.
</p>

<p>
	Sending a mob after Trudeau is overkill. Giving a stark and impassioned speech to the UN about climate change is appropriate.

<title>Is fear a concept about the past too?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/40082-is-fear-a-concept-about-the-past-too/?do=findComment&amp;comment=502842</link>

<p>
	Fear is always about the future.
</p>

<p>
	You don't fear your past rape. You fear having to experience that again.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you are afraid of your memories of that event, what you fear is re-living that experience (via your memories) in the future.
</p>

<p>
	So even fear of a memory is fear of the future, not the past. Because fear is fundamentally resistance to future experience. If something has already been experienced, or is being currently experienced, it is not feared, since it's already here there is no need to fear it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't believe me. Explore how fear actually works in your direct experience. Notice whether your fear is actually of the past, the present, or the future. This requires some good mindfulness skill.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to turn this into speculation about how fear works. Do not speculate or guess! Actually look at what fear is doing in your direct experience. There's no room for guesswork here.
</p>

<p>
	Is fear about the past or the future? Don't guess! Check what your fear is doing.
</p>

<p>
	Shaming some folks in a UN speech is one thing, sicking a mob onto a political leader for a minor past mistake to get revenge is another thing.
</p>

<p>
	This requires a delicate balancing act. I don't think people should be fired for minor mistakes, like what happened with Al Franken. Sure, he made some mistakes, but did it really deserve a firing?
</p>

<p>
	We need some way of repremanding a person without destroying their whole career.

</p>

<p>
	Don't worry so much about getting a breakthrough. That will come naturally once you are ready for it. The way you get ready for it is by doing smaller trips, contemplating deeply, doing other practices, and taking time to integrate each trip.
</p>

<p>
	Do 10-20 smaller trips and integrate all those insights. Then you'll be ready for a breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	You're trying to go too fast and your psyche isn't equipped to handle it.
</p>

<p>
	This work is a marathon, not a sprint.
</p>

<p>
	It took me about 1 year to integrate my highest dose (30mg) 5-MeO-DMT trip. Now I can handle a lot more (not dosage-wise but insight-wise).
</p>

<p>
	It all comes down to this key question: How much mindfuck can your psyche handle?
</p>

<p>
	The mindfuck goes much deeper than anyone expects. It blindsides you and you don't even know what happened because Truth is such a mindfuck.
</p>

<p>
	Your desire for goodness creates hell, since good and bad are in truth one. So by desiring goodness only you desire falsehood.

<p>
	It serves the purpose of maintaining your identity as a material being.
</p>

<p>
	Once you realize there is no brain, your whole life collapses.
</p>

<p>
	"The brain" is like the ultimate plot hole filler in the narrative that you call your life.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of the brain is not physical (as you assume) but imaginary. Without the story of a brain you have no way of explaining where you came from or what you are.

	There exists no storage solution for radioactive nuclear waste. Think about that. You want to build radioactive material that will last for 10,000 years with no plan for what to do with it.

<p>
	How about we first exhaust solar and wind. Then if we still need more energy we can consider nuclear.
</p>

<p>
	In the long run solar is the ultimate energy source. We just need to scale it up massively.

	Actually no physical signature is happening. You merely imagine it.

<p>
	There is no such thing as a brain at all. Nor is there a physical world.

<p>
	Very few Buddhists understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	Buddhism still has a lot of dogma in it. Even when people speak of the classical Buddhist enlightenment, they speak of it dogmatically, not from deep personal experience.
</p>

<p>
	And even if they've had some degree of awakening, it's still far shy of full God mode.
</p>

<p>
	So in practice 99.999% of Buddhists don't fully understand their own teachings.
</p>
