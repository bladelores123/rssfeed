	Enlightenment will strip all meaning from life. Hence why nobody pursues it.
</p>

<p>
	You can't get to Being while you're still stuck in meaning.

I know them all too well.
</p>

<p>
	You can do all the spiritual work you want, but the fact remains that PUA is an escape from the real inner work. When you get to real spiritual work PUA will fly out the window as delusional nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	I am not going to argue with you about it. You can figure it out on your own. All the points I made are still valid, despite your rebuttals.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, I don't object to talking to girls in clubs to improve your game. What I object to is the toxic anti-woman ideology that comes with it.
</p>

<p>
	PUA is like Islam. Good in theory but often ugly in practice.
</p>

<p>
	I know most of the RSD instructors. They are very immature and dysfunctional. With that said, yes, they still help lots of guys. They helped me. But you also gotta move on.
</p>

<p>
	The sad irony is, all these mens rights movements are way more ugly and toxic than feminism. Which is precisely why all this hatred of feminism exists. It's just compensation for one's own inadequacies.
</p>

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	Although it's complicated. You have to understand that mystics and enlightened people tend to reside outside Spiral the entirely.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality cannot be mapped. Nonduality is not a stage you reach. Nonduality is Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Never forget that Spiral Dynamics is just a model, and it is not designed to model mysticism, altered states of consciousness, or nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a model of levels of nonduality, Ramaji's LOC system is better suited to that. Although, still, it's just a model and will not address every facet.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Certainly the research shows it has medical properties of all kinds.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with it is addiction.
</p>

<p>
	True psychedelics are non-addictive.

<p>
	It just happens naturally as you trip. Just surrender to the trip and the substance will take you were you need to go, whether mentally or emotionally.
</p>

<p>
	I've had powerful emotional experiences on every substance. It mostly depends on you, not the substance.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms can be very emotional for me. They tend to be intoxicating and very trippy. LSD is better for metaphysical contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	As your trip starts you can set an intention to either: 1) work on personal emotional issues, 2) work on metaphysical insights, 3) work on life purpose and a vision for your life. Just pick one and see where it takes you.

			Sooo this is what RSDtyler said a few days ago:
		</p>

		<p>
			"I keep fucking falling into this trap.<br />
			<br />
			I read posts like this, and I think "Ya I'm being too extreme".<br />
			<br />
			Then I meet a "good girl" and I try to game her without all the fuck-boy stuff ......... and I get SHUT DOWN.<br />
			<br />
			The girl will even say "I just want to meet a guy who runs a business and doesn't do drugs and has a level head" and it's like HELLLOOOOOO I'MMMM HEEERRREEEE!!!  <br />
			<br />
			And then they go date a drug addicted degenerate.
		</p>

		<p>
			I fall back into that trap because of the negative influence of this forum and mainstream society that keeps telling me "A high quality woman will appreciate a high quality guy".<br />
			<br />
			Which is just flat wrong.<br />
			<br />
			I'm a high quality guy and I like HOT women.  I often date Instagram models and strippers because they are insanely hot.<br />
			<br />
			You can laugh at this and call it a flaw in my character, but when you have a perfect 10 professional hottie riding your cock.... I gotta be honest, there are few physical pleasures in life on that level.<br />
			<br />
			So if I fall into the same trap, and I'm a quality guy I think ... then i gotta remind myself that women do too.<br />
			<br />
			And stop believing this "quality attracts quality" bullshit.<br />
			<br />
			Humans are humans.  We like to feel super super super good whenever we can.  So be a sexual guy with women and they will appreciate it.  Stop correlating all this career and personal development shit with getting laid - too idealistic, not based in how reality actually works.<br />
			<br />
			Tyler"
		</p>

		<p>
			So does Tyler mean this exclusively for having sex and getting laid at the club? So does this mean getting laid as not orange will be difficult? 
		</p>

		<p>
			Or because hes too orange value system and doesnt know better?  
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is so toxic and neurotic I don't even know where to begin deconstructing it.
</p>

<p>
	That's how the world looks like when you're at Tyler's level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness, it does not look like that.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental problem with PUAs is, they want to bang the hottest 0.001% of girls, a new one very week, and when that girl rejects him or refuses to sleep with him within 4 hours of meeting him, he gets pissy and blames her for it. Because of course PUA can't be wrong by definition.
</p>

<p>
	Are young women in their early 20's attracted to low-quality men? Of course! In the same way that people are attracted to low quality food. The solution isn't to start another McDonalds. The supermodel girls in their 20's are immature and unconscious and have no idea how to select proper mates. PUA then blames and exploits them for it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you will definitely have more sex by manipulating girls. Just like you will definitely earn more money by manipulating and cheating customers. But that's not what you really want in the end.
</p>

<p>
	You don't really want a new supermodel girl every week. What you want is 1 girl who are able to love and build a deep relationship with. She doesn't even have to be that hot. That's your insatiable ego at work.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move for Tyler here would be to say, "I will surrender my desire for sex with a new super-model girl every week." The problem isn't that he can't get girls. The problem is that he is trying to reach God/Infinity through sex/girls/pickup, and this will NEVER work. Materialism never works. But rather than admitting that, the PUA will blame the women.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that PUAs are fundamentally incapable of being in relationships because they are too narcissistic and manipulative to have an honest, intimate, loving relationship. They are too immature to be vulnerable and to commit to one woman. Many PUAs are really just sex and ego addicts without realizing it. PUA becomes just another materialist escape, no different than TV, drugs, or porn. It's a 1st and 2nd chakra activity -- driven by very low consciousness needs.

<title>Whats wrong with Sam Harris?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/23004-whats-wrong-with-sam-harris/?do=findComment&amp;comment=254238</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	There are numerous problems I have with Sam Harris:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		He doesn't understand what God is, what enlightenment is, what consciousness is, or what intelligence is.
	</li>
	<li>
		He does not understand the true origins of religion.
	</li>
	<li>
		He still clings to and advocates a rationalist morality, without being conscious that morality is a human invention and a weapon of the ego.
	</li>
	<li>
		He demonizes Islam by citing poll studies which are greatly distorted and misrepresentative. The majority of Muslims DO NOT believe it is right to kill apostates, etc. Those polls are just bad.
	</li>
	<li>
		He has built a cult following of atheists and rationalists which use Sam to justify a closedminded scientism.
	</li>
	<li>
		He still fundamentally holds a dualistic, materialistic worldview -- despite his meditation and spiritual questing.
	</li>
	<li>
		He doesn't really fathom the depth of psychedelics.
	</li>
	<li>
		He doesn't really fathom the depth of consciousness.
	</li>
	<li>
		He doesn't understand what Truth is. He doesn't understand that science and language cannot access Truth.
	</li>
	<li>
		He treats consciousness as though it is produced by the brain.
	</li>
	<li>
		He advances American exceptionalism, which is a blindness to national and cultural self-bias.
	</li>
	<li>
		He acts as though Western culture is objectively better and superior to other cultures.
	</li>
	<li>
		In evaluating the problems in the Middle East he places way too much emphasis on Islamic beliefs vs geo-political, historical, and economic factors, which are far more significant.
	</li>
	<li>
		There is no acknowledgment that Islam can be practiced at different levels of consciousness: Purple, Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow, Turquoise. He paints all of Islam as Red/Blue. This is a fundamental error. The problems which exist within Islam are NOT due to specific beliefs in the Quran but due to lack of geo-political and consciousness development in the Middle East. All of the problems in the Middle East could be resolved without changing the Quran or the basics of Islam.
	</li>
	<li>
		He places way too much importance on the content of belief vs one's level of consciousness.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is engaging in a lesser Jihad and indoctrinating his fanbase into doing the same.
	</li>
	<li>
		Seems to me like he's making more enemies in the Middle East than building bridges. It's not an accident that he gets so many death threats. Because he's try to ram American culture down people's throats.
	</li>
	<li>
		He stokes up right wing Islamophobia.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	He is the poster-child for scientism by making claims like the following: "The scientific data can't be racist." Which is quite ignorant of what "data" is. There is no such thing as data. All data is theory-laden and will of course be cherry-picked by the ego to justify its self-biases. Which is precisely the problem of scientism, and what people like JP or Sam Harris are doing. They use "data" and "reason" to be advance their biases.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see an awareness of the nuances of epistemology within him. I also don't see an awareness of how the ego-mind uses logic, data, science, and rationality to advance its agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Sam's entire rationalist philosophy is ego-based from my perspective.
</p>

<p>
	He likes to play the philosopher without realizing that Western philosophy is dead because it is all mind-based ego games. You will never arrive a Truth via Western philosophy or science.
</p>

<p>
	And the problem is that because he presents an air of authority and intelligence, people just swallow it up without realizing that they are being indoctrinated into a religion.
</p>

<p>
	From the big picture perspective, the very problems that Sam Harris is pointing out within Islam, are the very same problems he himself is falling into. There is lack of self-awareness of the mechanisms of the ego-mind. Fundamentalism isn't just a problem for Islam. It's also a problem for materialistic atheists.
</p>

<p>
	If people didn't take him too seriously, that would be okay. But his fanbase is cult-like and really believes in it.

<p>
	You have to understand that stages Green, Yellow, Turquoise basically did not exist 200+ years ago. At least that's according to the Spiral Dynamics model.
</p>

<p>
	People from 2000 years ago lived in a radically different reality and culture. They were not like us today minus smartphones and cars.

<p>
	For starters, someone who has a sense of life purpose and doesn't play victim or whine about women.
</p>

<p>
	A man who complains about feminism isn't a real man, that's a pouting child.
</p>

<p>
	A real man has something of value to offer the woman. And he treats women well, with love and respect.

</p>

<p>
	Dating is much easier for guys than girls, so spare us your JP crocodile tears. You have no idea the kind of shit women go through.
</p>

<p>
	To expect top notch women to be handed to you on a silver platter sure sounds like communism.
</p>

<p>
	Women don't own you anything. Become a quality man and they will come aflocking.

<p>
	One of the best PUA friends I know is about that height. He is crazy good at attracting girls.
</p>

<p>
	He's like a sex mongoose.
</p>

<p>
	What girls care about most is your charisma and confidence. Not your appearance.
</p>

<p>
	You are projecting your caring about appearance onto girls. Girls don't think like you.

<title>Best psychedelic for improving the mind - (pls don't say that's an oxymoron)</title>

<p>
	I've done over 30 trips. I have not noticed any improvements of the mind per se.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I've gotten tons of insights.
	</li>
	<li>
		I've gotten lots of emotional growth.
	</li>
	<li>
		I've gotten a deconstruction of my conceptual matrix.
	</li>
	<li>
		I've gotten crazy depths of consciousness.
	</li>
	<li>
		I've gotten massive openmindedness.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	But no baseline improvement of memory or things like that.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga, visualization, contemplation, concentration exercises will have a better chance of improving your mind vs psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	If you have memory problems, perhaps look into vitamins or nootropics and clean up your diet.
</p>

<p>
	Good God!
</p>

<p>
	Enough of this nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	Western society is still highly patriarchal.
</p>

<p>
	The reason men are sexless is cause they sit around watching JP too much and playing video games all day. It's hard to have sex when you're sitting in your man-cave all day.
</p>

<p>
	What ever happened to taking responsibility for your sexlessness rather than blaming women and society for it?
</p>

<p>
	By Peterson's logic society should ban:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		TV
	</li>
	<li>
		Video games
	</li>
	<li>
		Internet
	</li>
	<li>
		Porn
	</li>
	<li>
		Virtual reality
	</li>
	<li>
		Smartphones
	</li>
	<li>
		Social media
	</li>
	<li>
		Nerd culture
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That would solve most of your sex problems.
</p>

<p>
	A real man doesn't blame women for his lack of development. Any guy can learn to get good with attracting women. But it takes inner work, and it requires going outside your man-cave and actually talking to women.
</p>

<p>
	RSD is really the practical solution to the male problems JP rants about.
</p>

<p>
	But of course then you've got all the problems that come with getting indoctrinated into RSD culture. Which I've already ranted about in the past.
</p>

<p>
	What would really solve this problem is if schools did a better job of teaching boys and girls how to interact with each other.
</p>

<p>
	Because Green cares too much.

<p>
	It's all about finding the right balance.
</p>

<p>
	If a mother loves her son so much that she isn't able to let him go to school (because she wants him around the house all day) then she cares too much, and her care has become neurotic. To this mother we would say, "Stop caring about your son so much", to which she would reply, "So you want me to hate my son?! NEVER! You are a monster!" At which point we would say, "Sigh..."

	That's exactly how you get enlightened masters who molest people, or are secretly greedy, or dogmatic, or can't run a biz, etc.
</p>

<p>
	There is a lot more to life than sitting in a cave. If all you plan to do is sit in a cave for the next 50 years, okay. But that is not what you will do. You will enter all sorts of complex interactions with people in a complex society. That's when shit will hit the fan.

<title>Whats wrong with Sam Harris?</title>

<p>
	Rationalism, materialism, scientism, moralism, intellectual crusading, demonization of Islam, duality.
</p>

<p>
	Sam Harris is stuck playing the role of an intellectual. The lesser Jihad.
</p>

<p>
	All classic traps you should watch out for.
</p>

<p>
	Writing a book or talking about spirituality & meditation does not mean one is awakened or has a profound understanding of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	If you're at stage Blue/Orange/Green, Sam Harris might be useful to you. Once you get beyond that, he will hold you back.
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing "wrong" with him. He is who he is.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness is a very tricky thing. Let's say you are not compassionate, does that mean you are less one?
</p>

<p>
	There is a danger of taking on "compassion" and "goodness" as truer than "hate" and "badness". But that just perpetuates the duality. The deepest levels of consciousness are beyond compassion, beyond human concerns, beyond being good.
</p>

<p>
	The distinction between love and hate must collapse in the end.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate litmus test would be this: when you see great hate, are you still able to love? Does your compassion extend to the perpetrator as well as the victim? Or are you cherrypicking?

	What I'm trying to do here is show you that you are cherrypicking the truth to suit your ego. Which is something you'll have to outgrow if you really want to reach liberation and peace.

<p>
	Of course!
</p>

<p>
	Not just freedom of speech, but even self defense and the right to life.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is, you have no rights. All "rights" are just inventions of the human ego to make life easier for the ego in an otherwise brutal reality.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you value freedom of speech is because your ego wants to mouth off its agenda without being limited. Egos hate having their agendas limited in any way. It hinders the ego's survival ability.
</p>

<p>
	If we passed a law which said that I could rape your child, but you are forbidden to ever speak of it, not even in court -- that would be a huge problem for your ego.

<p>
	"When it's not necessary" is a highly subjective call. The ego always finds it convenient to do unnecessary things.
</p>

<p>
	A person who does violence to another doesn't do it gratuitously. In his mind, he feels it is very necessary -- selfless even.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I know you don't, which is why I went out of my way to underscore that it is a survival issue.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is very sneaky. It loves to don the veil of devoting oneself to the "protection of others" when in fact you are devoting yourself to advancing your own egoic agenda. Devotion creates a self-righteous ego which then goes on to commit great atrocities. All great atrocities are done in the name of good, freedom, liberation, truth, rights, fairness, etc.
</p>

<p>
	What do you think terrorists and Nazi's are doing? They are trying to make the world a better place.
</p>

<p>
	"Make the world a better place" is ALWAYS relative to your ego! There is no such thing as an objectively good world. A good world for one group is a bad world for another group. Which is why conflict happens.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you think you can get all of mankind to work peacefully together, that is still mankind's collective ego. Who's to say that mankind is a good thing, and not a cancer in this universe? You? Mankind? Ha! Do you see the conflict of interest problem?
</p>

<p>
	This is very important to understand. Otherwise you will still be under the ego's influence.
</p>

<p>
	Consider: the only reason you care about mankind is because you identify with being mankind. That's your ego. If you were an ant, you wouldn't care about mankind at all. Nor would you care about slavery, human rights, or anything else of that sort.
</p>

<p>
	Your self-identification extends far beyond your physical body. You identify with all sorts of abstract self-images, like the image of "being a decent human being who fights for the rights of the weak and the poor against the oppression of the strong and greedy". That's YOUR self-image! It turns you on. You get off on it. Playing this role is an addiction.

</p>

<p>
	Your question is coming from a certain level of consciousness: duality.
</p>

<p>
	Your question is really about survival, not being or Truth. Survival demands constant manipulation. That is life. Improving society is a function of survival. Think of politics as nothing more than hunting squirrels in the forest to make sure you don't starve to death. That's what government is fundamentally about.
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing wrong with improving society, just like there's nothing wrong with hunting squirrels to survive, but there is a meta-issue: your preoccupation with survival is keeping you from realizing that the world is an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	What if one day you wake up and realize that all of this work you've been doing to improve society was happening inside a dream state? Such that slavery, racism, evil, nuclear weapons, science, and even your mother and father do not exist because they were just a dream? How silly would you feel then to have worried so much about all that stuff?

</blockquote>

<p>
	These are awakened people you are talking about it. To them, reality is just a dream. Nothing is serious. Whatever actions they take to "improve society" is just for shits and giggles. They are shooting at squirrels in the forest just for fun. It's a form of self-amusement. They are detached from it. They would not really care if the entire planet was nuked tomorrow. They would be just as happy. It would not be a problem for them in the same way that seeing the Earth get nuked on TV isn't a problem for you -- because you are conscious it isn't real to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	All human suffering is unreal.
</p>

<p>
	This kind of level of consciousness is difficult to fathom for someone who has not awoken from the dream. It is unimaginable that this could be possible.
</p>

<p>
	The reason an enlightened sage is good at helping people is because he is already dead inside. There is nothing for him to fear or lose. The world does not need improving, yet there is nothing else to really do here but help improve the world. That is the paradox. But you won't understand this at stage Green. You need some enlightenment experiences to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Morality is a function of survival. Not Truth. The ultimate truth is, there are no problems whatsoever and evil doesn't exist. Yes... detachment is a very radical and counter-intuitive thing.
</p>

<p>
	P.P.S. Advanced sages don't usually come out and say this so bluntly because they would be crucified by ignorant people for saying such things.

<title>Spiral Dynamics Stage Yellow Examples Mega-Thread</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Hey, ya'll, I need your help!
</p>

<p>
	I want to create a comprehensive list of video examples of prototypical stage Yellow thinking.
</p>

<p>
	This is not meant to humiliate or demonize stage Yellow. It's meant to be an educational tool for people learning about Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	So towards that end, scour Youtube and find all the videos you can which exhibit stage Yellow thinking. Try to find videos which are short and sweet. The more diversity we can display here, the better. Try to find examples from various cultures: Europe, Middle East, Asia, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, Africa, South America, etc.
</p>

<p>
	We will create a mega-thread like this for every stage in the Spiral, from Red to Turquoise. But here, let's just focus on Yellow. Each week I will start a new mega-thread topic for the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	Do not start a political debate in this thread! It is not our goal here to defend our personal political positions or to judge any stage, but simply to compile examples.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for your help! I'm excited to see what kind of juicy stuff you dig up. Try to be selective with your choices.
</p>

<p>
	This can turn into a really cool list.
</p>

			But you can't contemplate and imbibe Trump it looks like, even though you think you're so much more evolved than him. You wouldn't use such demeaning terms on a full red person even.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Because to take Trump seriously is to go too far. The proper response to Trump is ridicule.
</p>

<p>
	You don't engage someone like that in serious discussion because he is not an honest actor. He's a con-artist and he doesn't care about truth. So there can be no serious philosophical discussion with him or his ilk.
</p>

<p>
	This is not really judgment. Yes, it's my subjective evaluation. Trump is who he is and he cannot be otherwise. In fact, he is a facet of myself, so for me to demonize him would be just me demonizing God. Which is silly to do. But that doesn't mean I have go along with Trump's machinations. Trump is just very unconscious, and there millions of unconscious people all over the world. I can refuse to take part in their unconsciousness without making it a personal thing.
</p>

<p>
	For me to concede ground to unconsciousness when I know better would just be foolish. Whether you agree with me or not is not my problem. You are free to disagree with me and love Trump. Ultimately you have to learn to think for yourself. I am just presenting my ideas here.
</p>

<p>
	There is always a point at which you have to draw a line. For example, if someone comes to you and says, 1+1=5, you laugh him off. If you took every such case seriously, you would be very open to manipulation. People could just overwhelm you with false information to push their egoic agendas through. So there needs to be a firewall. The key is tuning your firewall properly so it doesn't reject legitimate points of view. It's always possible to miscalibrate one's firewall, but in the case of Trump, I'm not too worried about that being a problem. He's just not presidential material. This should be obvious to any unbiased observer. If you disagree, then we'll just have to agree to disagree and we'll see who wins at the ballet box in 2020.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, Infinity is not a concept, because concepts are finite.
</p>

<p>
	I mean actual Infinity. Which cannot be spoken because you are it.
</p>

<p>
	Calculus speaks of transfinite infinities, which are smaller infinities than the Absolute. I am speaking of what Georg Cantor called Absolute Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	See my 2-part series: Understanding Absolute Infinity
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity is identical to what you call "life", "perception", or "physical reality" -- but you are not conscious of its true nature as yet.

<p>
	Hehehe....
</p>

<p>
	That's LIFE: A battle against entropy that we will all lose.
</p>

<p>
	That's not the issue. The issue is, HOW will you live life? What is the healthiest way to live? That's what Spiral Dynamics is about.
</p>

<p>
	Manipulation of the world must happen for life to live. The question, which ways of manipulating are the healthiest, the most sustainable, the least harmful?
</p>

<p>
	Even after enlightenment you will still have to manipulate life if you want to live.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Blue/Orange is opposed to weed.
</p>

<p>
	Case in point: Jeff Sessions has a hard-on for criminalizing weed.
</p>

<p>
	Legalizing weed will open the gateway for psychedelic experiences, which spells doom for the Blue & Orange paradigms. Orange doesn't like weed because it: A) hurts profits, B) undermines Orange's mindless materialistic ambitions, C) undermines capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	Weed will help Green win the progressive culture war. Which Blue/Orange doesn't want. Weed helps open the mind and heart. So a closed-minded, closed-hearted ego will not allow it.
</p>

<p>
	It's no accident that weed is legalized in the most developed Green countries and states in the world first. Alabama is not about to legalize weed. Because they are too Blue.
</p>

<p>
	If California is the head of the snake, Alabama is the tail.
</p>

			"And yet when I say 'strange loop', I have something else in mind — a less concrete, more elusive notion. What I mean by 'strange loop' is — here goes a first stab, anyway — not a physical circuit but an abstract loop in which, in the series of stages that constitute the cycling-around, there is a shift from one level of abstraction (or structure) to another, which feels like an upwards movement in a hierarchy, and yet somehow the successive 'upward' shifts turn out to give rise to a closed cycle. That is, despite one's sense of departing ever further from one's origin, one winds up, to one's shock, exactly where one had started out. In short, a strange loop is a paradoxical level-crossing feedback loop."

<p>
	The point is to realize that religion is just what happens when you try to spread mysticism to the whole world, but the world is largely undeveloped, so they fail to get it.
</p>

<p>
	An ignorant person cannot help misunderstanding mysticism.
</p>

<p>
	Just like an ignorant rationalist cannot help misunderstanding religion.
</p>

<p>
	In all cases, the common denominator is ignorance. Which we are all guilty of in spades. So who is to blame?
</p>

<p>
	Since all that exists is the Self, there is no one to blame but oneself.

			That said, almost everyone from my hometown (a small redneck town in Florida) are huge Trump supporters... including my mom who was previously into a lot of Green initiatives. And I was so disheartened when he won the election. I felt sick the whole week. I didn't know that my mom even supported him, and I never would have seen it coming. She'd never mentioned either.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then she came to visit for Thanksgiving a few weeks later, and I was excited to vent to her about it. But all I heard about all weekend was about how amazing Trump is and how "He's so rich that no one can buy him." and "He tells it like it is." And just thinking that his idea of a Muslim ban and the wall are awesome. And how closed minded and hyperbolic I was being by saying that his idea of police profiling Muslims and making them wear IDs was similar to what the Nazis did. Then, when she came for Christmas it got even worse.

<p>
	Hehehe... yeah. Blue/Orange really likes Trump. He knows just how to market to their fears and hopes.
</p>

<p>
	Meanwhile Green is horrified by the backwardness of it all.
</p>

<p>
	Much of American society is still Bluish. If you live in a Green part of the country like LA or NY, this is easy to forget. It's telling that NYers hate Trump, lol. They know his con-game well.

</p>

<p>
	Bernie Sanders seems like a healthy Green leader. There is a high likihood of a Green leader winning in the next election cycle as mainstream America sees the full ugliness of Trump's version of Orange America. It's going to turn a lot of moderate, mainstream people off. Trump is less consciousness than the average decent American.
</p>

<p>
	The entire culture needs to shift Greener. Which is why we have this on-going culture war. Blue/Orange does not want to shift Green. Hence it's so actively demonizing Green and fighting against it tooth and nail. Hence the rise of someone like JP, who's riding this wave.
</p>

<p>
	But Green is coming regardless. It cannot be stopped. #MeToo and weed legalization is sweeping the nation, and more of that will come. America still has yet to awaken to Green's opening of the heart.
</p>

<p>
	To me, it's not a question of IF, it's question of HOW LONG?
</p>

<p>
	It's gonna be interesting to watch it all unfold.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, in the end, Trump will be a good thing for mankind. We need Trump to learn the lessons of electing narcissistic morons.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this lesson will come with some great costs. As all lessons do.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's depravity is shedding light on many weakness in our institutions which need shoring up. We are lucky Trump is too incompetent to be an effective dictator. In the future, we might not be so lucky.

<p>
	I think TYT plays an important role. They have some good ideas and initiatives which are much-needed, like their push to pass a Constitutional amendment to get all money out of politics. That would be a game-changer, and is very much needed, and it's not even a partisan issue. Both left and right wingers should be for getting all money out of politics.
</p>

<p>
	TYT is certainly far superior to right-wing (stage Blue/Orange) propaganda outlets and talk show hosts like Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, Alex Jones, Breitbart, Fox News, etc.
</p>

<p>
	But TYT also increases the polarization in our politics. It adds gasoline to fire and it has its blindspots. And it tends to over-simply the right wing without really understanding it. Which ends up backfiring.
</p>

<p>
	A stage Yellow approach would be wiser, I think. We need a politics which isn't Democrat or Republican, but Spirocrat <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> But society hasn't evolved that far yet.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in the long run society will become more harmonious, integrated, and fair. As it has been for the last 2000 years. But not without some ego backlash and bitter battles. Tyranny never gives up without a good fight.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity necessitates war.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most profound things you can contemplate when you're tripping on LSD is: Why does war exist? What is the existential basis for all conflict? Be prepared to have your mind blow.

			Do you think (counterintuitively) demonization and volatility actually serves a purpose in moving us forward as human beings in Tier 1 of Spiral Dynamics, despite the fact that demonization is a sign of unconsciousness? Or do you think that it serves no purpose or detracts from our movement forward as a species?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a tricky topic because in the ultimate big picture, EVERYTHING serves its purpose. Cenk's demonizing the right has its purpose. White people lynching black people has its purpose. Nazis killing Jews had its purpose. Racism, war, genocide, slavery, anti-Semitism, rape, murder, theft, corruption, harassment, abuse, tribalism, etc. It ALL serves a purpose. It's all totally inevitable and part of Infinity. This is the bitter pill that no ego wants to swallow because the ego loves to judge and be self-righteous and to create an environment which aids the ego's survival.
</p>

<p>
	So if you're gonna say that demonization is moving us forward. Okay. But also realize, so did Nazi concentration camps.
</p>

<p>
	It will take some deep enlightenment experiences to accept that. It will not make sense to the ego-mind. The ego-mind is too selfish to see it. And the ego-mind will try to use this fact to further its agenda by saying things like, "Well, I robbed that person, but it was totally inevitable, like Leo said. So I didn't do anything wrong."
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is just ego being a sneaky manipulative snake. Which is also inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	Reality cannot be other than exactly how it is. The challenge for ego is to surrender to what is.
</p>

<p>
	By definition, anything that happens within reality, servers the ultimate purpose. There is nothing within reality which is "wrong" or "should be otherwise". You cannot optimize reality beyond what it is. It is already 100% optimal and anything that occurs is part of that opitmality unfolding. It just unfolds in counter-intuitive ways. Most people would not think that murder is optimal, but that's because they are not seeing the biggest picture. They are not thinking infinite moves ahead the way God does. So to them, stuff looks sub-optimal. But that is just ignorance. At higher levels of consciousness that will fall away and there will be total acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	This is the #1 reason why nonduality cannot go mainstream. This truth is too brutal for people to accept.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You wouldn't think it stupid if you were an oppressed woman with no voting rights and few legal or financial rights.
</p>

<p>
	You think it's stupid because it doesn't fit your ego's agenda. From your ego's POV, there's nothing wrong and no need for equality because you already have a decent position in the game.
</p>

<p>
	But if you were a woman in Saudi Arabia with no right to drive or open a bank account, you might feel otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	Or if you had a couple of daughters who get sexually harassed, you might start to see things differently. Now your ego will have some skin in the game. Now it will be personal for you, whereas before it was academic.
</p>

<p>
	What feminist movements are doing in action is creating more equal rights for women. On paper, they have all kinds of academic theories. But in action, women today enjoy many benefits the couldn't imagine 100 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	To understand feminism you have to step outside your male perspective. It ain't about you.
</p>

	Green rant against Blue/Orange:
</p>

<p>
	I like this one because it shows how Blue/Orange demonizes Green, and then Green demonizes Blue/Orange back. So both sides end up vilifying each other without mutual understanding. It's tribal warfare.

<p>
	Guess who hates equality?
</p>

<p>
	Mr. Ego
</p>

<p>
	Equality will always be resisted by those whom equality seeks to level. The ego doesn't want equality, it wants control.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is a little tyrant. And no tyrant wants to be deposed. But in the end, the tyrant always loses. It just takes a long time and a lot of people get hurt in the process.

<p>
	Sounds like you are very right-brained.
</p>

<p>
	For such people, like myself, it can be very easy to understand something in a nonlinear, nonverbal fashion, but then quite a challenge to articulate it linearly. Because the truth is nonlinear, all linear explanations of it are partial and misleading.
</p>

<p>
	But with practice you can get good at articulating the inarticulable.
</p>

<p>
	Writing in a journal would probably help you organize your thoughts.

</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism</a>
</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself this: "How many books have I read on this topic?"
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of griping is that its a distraction from study, contemplation, and understanding.

	A) Your sits should be no longer than 60 mins each. Take short breaks. Get up and do some walking meditation.
</p>

<p>
	B) Hardcore monks and yogis sit through excruciating pain. Levels of pain you can barely imagine. This approach only works if you're really hardcore.

<p>
	Enlightenment is not an opinion or a belief.
</p>

<p>
	Either do the self-inquiry work, or don't.
</p>

<p>
	If you are interested in enlightenment, you do the work. You don't ask other people for their opinions about reality. Their opinions will not help you at all.
</p>

<p>
	Just like if you wanted to become a millionaire, you never ask people, "What do you guys think of millionaires? Are they real?" You go do the work to become one.

	Yeah, I've been there. I feel ya. Especially the breakups are hard.
</p>

<p>
	It's important, when do this work, that you don't make major life decisions too rashly.
</p>

<p>
	If you had a good relationship, then I don't really see a point in breaking it up unless you are just not interested in that any more and want to go 100% solo.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it will be hard going full-Buddha. Much harder than most people realize.
</p>

<p>
	Expect major ego backlash. Fast, dramatic, and intense is what you're signing up for when you go full-Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	It's not necessary to go full-Buddha. But maybe for you it's the right move. Only you can know what you're capable of.

<title>Is there objective reality without subjective perception?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	There is no such thing as subjective perception. Ego appropriates the Absolute for itself, creating the illusion of subjective experience.
</p>

<p>
	Without ego, subjective experiences becomes recontextualized into the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Your experiences are not really yours. And they are not really experiences, but Being.
</p>

<p>
	"But Leo! I'm having this experience right now! I'm seeing the world!" << No! That is ego! The universe is simply being. The universe is not happening "to you". This life is not yours! The universe is alive without you.
</p>

<p>
	Without ego, what was always subjective becomes objective. Being has instant direct objective knowledge of itself via no mechanism -- DIRECTLY! Being is. Out of blind self-centeredness, the ego-mind mistakes Being for perception. It's like looking at clouds and always seeing rabbits instead of clouds because you're always looking for rabbits.
