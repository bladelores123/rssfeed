</p>

<p>
	Your worldview may not be racist, but it is fundamentally ethnocentric. The very fact that you see the world in terms of races and cultures which cannot get along is your worldview. Notice that your position is coming from a place of FEAR and LACK. That has nothing to do with truth, it's your constructed worldview, and this worldview is serving your survival as a self.
</p>

<p>
	If those immigrants were your own mother, you'd sing a different tune.
</p>

<p>
	IQ is a silly metric. To make any arguments based on IQ difference is absurd because IQ depends upon the country's infrastructure and level of development, not racial differences. And even if there is an IQ difference, so what? A nation has people of all levels of IQ in it. You cannot keep all the low IQ people in some sealed off part of the world. Low IQ people are all part of our situation on this planet. Also, just because someone is high IQ does not make them an angel. There are many high IQ people who are ruining this country with financial exploitation. IQ is not equal to moral development or consciousness. Which is why it's such a bad metric.
</p>

<p>
	The world is going to be a multicultural place no matter how much you resist it, so might as well embrace it and get used to it. It already is multicultural. Immigration is the result of multiculturalism. When you create boundaries between countries, nature will obviously work to blur those boundaries. So the irony of what is happening is here is: humans invented all these imaginary ethnic and national boundaries, and now the forces of nonduality are telling you: not so fast! Those boundaries cannot remain permanent because no boundaries in the universe are permanent.
</p>

<p>
	The logic that you're using is that same kind of logic that people used against the Jews, Irish, Italians, and other people who immigrated to the USA throughout history. These Europeans were considered dirty, uneducated, non-White, and that they would corrupt society. Now it's totally obvious such logic is silly. Your logic is warped by fear of "other".
</p>

<p>
	No one is saying that we should have Wahhabist communities in the USA. And to conflate Latin American asylum seekers with Wahhabists is absurd. Again, coming from fear.
</p>

<p>
	Immigration has been a part of American culture since the very beginning. So to say that somehow these different races and cultures cannot get along is a projection of your own fear and also historically inaccurate. They CAN get along, but certainly not if you have an ethnocentric worldview which believes that different races cannot get along. By believing it won't work, you manifest it. To get along, you gotta stop seeing the world as all these different groups and start seeing the fundamental humanity of all humans. You also need to stop thinking so negative of people with lower IQs. As if IQ somehow determines a person's worth.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate reason immigration is happening is because you cannot have a wealthy country next to a poor country. Nature will try to equalize that differential until both countries are equalized. Don't forget that much of American wealth and success is built directly off of exploitation of poor countries. The US manipulates Latin American countries to exploit them financially. Then when asylum seekers come, that's directly related to American foreign policy around the world.
</p>

<p>
	It's all interconnected and you're missing this key point.
</p>

<p>
	Your fundamental argument is that people are just too different to get along. But all of these people are on the same planet. So whether you like it or not, we have to learn to get along or we will kill each other. Learning how to get two different people to get along is our whole job! You cannot have a global economy as we do while also segregating people. What you're basically talking about is segregation. Your same logic was used to oppose the integration of black kids into white schools in the 60's. The whites' argument was identical to yours: "We aren't racists! All we're saying is, if you integrate dumb black kids into our elite white schools, this will ruin our schools. And they will get into fist fights because they are too different." Yeah! That's called segregation, LOL. That's ethnocentrism and selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	All of this is collective ego 101. We've seen it happening in human history from the dawn of civilization. Nothing new in your logic at all.
</p>

<title>Why many awakened philosophers were atheists?</title>

<p>
	None of those folks were awakened except the Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	It's very rare for a Western philosopher to be awakened.
</p>

<p>
	Heraclitus, Plotinus, Berkeley, and Hegel were some of the few I think were awakened.
</p>

<p>
	Buddha-nature/Buddha-mind is God. Nirvana is God.

<title>Is a Guru Essentially a Life Coach</title>

<p>
	No, life coaching is a very specific thing, sort of like therapy.
</p>

<p>
	A guru is something distinct from that. A guru is guiding you to awakening. A life coach is not. The method of guidance is also different.
</p>

<p>
	Coaching is mostly done over the phone. A guru is mostly face to face.

<p>
	I would not trust Jung as a source of deep authority about matters of awakening because I do not consider him to be deeply enlightened, regardless of his other valid insights and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	The "ego" is a bit tricky and clumsy here. We have to be careful how we define that term because it can refer to various things depending on who's using it.
</p>

<p>
	From my experiences, the sense of human sense is a total illusion. The most enlightened people should have difficultly even distinguishing themselves from another human or animal because their consciousness is so universal. At my highest levels of consciousness I could not even understand how I ever thought I was born as a human. It just didn't make sense because it was so patently false & imaginary. And this was definitely not a pathological state. This is the most beautiful and profound thing ever.
</p>

<p>
	What happens at the highest levels of nondual consciousness is that the ego collapses and you become the entire Universe. Every movement of the Universe is your movement and Will. Every molecule in your hand is materialized into being by your Will (God's Will). For example, I once picked up a stray black hair from an ex-girlfriend on my carpet and I was fully conscious of how I designed that hair using my Infinite Intelligence, and how I designed my ex-girlfriend. But this cannot be communicated in any linear fashion whatsoever. The only one who can know these things is God. You must be God to understand it. A human cannot understand it.
</p>

<p>
	I think becoming God cannot be a disease if you do it properly. There can probably be many pathologies along the way as the ego-mind refuses to fully surrender and integrate.
</p>

<p>
	Probably the biggest danger at this point is that you can become so conscious that you just leave the body and merge into total undifferentiated Infinity. Maha-Samadhi. But I think this would be a conscious choice, so you newbies don't worry about it.
</p>

	Yeah, apparently Jesus had quite a temper as a young teen. If the stories are to be believed.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	That makes perfect sense to me. He'd have to literally be God, tapped into enough of God's mind to be able to reimagine a person's disease. I suspect it would be sort of like hacking into the central database of a massively multiplayer game and erasing a couple of files, so that that change propagates to all the client machines.
</p>

<p>
	It would require an enormous amount of consciousness. It would be very dangerous if such things were allowed to anyone but the purest of souls. Your intent has to be totally pure and selfless. At that point it is not right to even call it your intent or your will, it becomes the intent of the Universe and that is why it would end up working -- because it really isn't a personal wish at that point, it is the very creative force which spawns "physical reality".
</p>

<p>
	This is definitely way beyond your run of the mill Neo-Advaita enlightened people. They are not conscious enough to do such things.
</p>

<p>
	I also suspect that Jesus may not have been human. Giving him access to another league of spiritual powers.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Not so much on 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Although during my highest dose trip I had such a massive heart opening and kundalini activation that it shot out of my fingertips like invisible Jedi force lightning and pealed the skin on my fingertips, which remained pealed and cracked for a few weeks and took time to heal. It was a very overwhelming experience. Too much God too fast.
</p>

<p>
	On DPT, however, I have more visionary abilities. Like I described in some of my recent blog videos, I experimented with performing healing on myself and even healing the collective consciousness of mankind as a whole. DPT is a better tool for that. I'm still trying to figure out how it work. Seems like performing miracles is possible with it.
</p>

<p>
	I suspect that to be able to preform miracles one needs to have or somehow develop extraordinary, superhuman visionary capacity more so than just pure nondual consciousness. These seem to be distinct aspects of consciousness which can be developed independently, or perhaps together synergisticly.
</p>

<p>
	I think it may be possible to actually tap into the collective consciousness of an entire species and modify the trajectory of its evolution through one's will. Of course at this level of consciousness it's not your human will, it is the Will of God at work creating the entire universe. It's very hard to explain because it is utterly nonlinear and beyond words or any kind of human logic. Ordinary laws of cause and effect don't apply there. I have much more exploring to do there to make sense of how it works. Seems promising so far. Of course no one will believe it. It's hard to believe even as you're doing it. To the human mind it seems nuts and impossible.
</p>

<p>
	My theory is this: if you want to perform a miracle which objectively registered in other people's mind, you have to actually tap into the collective consciousness of all sentient beings and make the change at that level. Because the physical world has to be consistent across individual minds. You can't just change a thing for one mind but not another.
</p>

<p>
	I spend most of my time alone. If I worked at Starbucks, yeah, maybe I'd have to hide it. I'm fortunate in that regard.
</p>

<p>
	Most days there are moments of such deep love and profound understanding that tears cannot be stopped.
</p>

<p>
	For me this whole thing is not just about the state of consciousness but the profound understandings that pour nonstop. Reality is understood at higher and higher levels. Everything becomes so interconnected. I can watch a guy flick his cigarette out of the car driving at 40 miles per hour, catch a quick glimpse of the cigarette as it bounces off the asphalt and realize that in that cigarette butt lies an entire universe, as deep and infinite as the celestial universe our astronomers explore. Stuff like that all day long.
</p>

<p>
	I think there's quite a range of variability in how people experience nonduality. For some it will be more heart-centered and feeling-based, for others more head-centered and intellectual, for other more visual, for others more visionary, for others more wacky & paranormal, etc.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I wouldn't say I feel it. I would phrase it as: I understand my body is the imagination of God. Sometimes I look at my hands and see them as magic. Most of the day, however, when I'm on autopilot, I lose sight of the magic, simply residing in the mundaneness of everyday human life.
</p>

<p>
	There are moments throughout the day where I stop and consciously reconnect with the magic. Like, "Oh yeah! These hands are the hands of God!" But then I usually go back into functional living.
</p>

<p>
	I know I can deepen this a lot more with more work.
</p>

<p>
	I still need more work to calm the body and mind down to be still for long periods of time. I'm not so good at that because I am constantly bombarded with wisdom. Wisdom and insights pour all day long. I run out of energy just verbalizing them all for the benefit of mankind. I feel it is my duty to be a mouthpiece for God's infinite wisdom. And I enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to say. For me, the awakening experienced on 5-MeO-DMT represents the purest form of nondual consciousness. I'm not sure what it takes to turn that into an unbroken state. It's total God-mode. You would be a walking God with that level of consciousness and you would transform the entire planet simply through the power of your presence. You could look a charging elephant in the eye and get him to bow before you. It is truly superhuman.
</p>

<p>
	At that level I could no longer teach verbally. My teaching would be to walk around town blessing crowds of homeless people, children, and throngs of followers, and performing miracles. Grown men would be brought to tears from the radiance of my love. Birds would land in my hand.
</p>

<p>
	People would write myths about it a 1000 years later.
</p>

<p>
	I am nowhere near that level.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	There are degrees of it. The highest degrees of it are certainly not my perpetual state. At the highest degrees it would be hard to walk.
</p>

<p>
	I'm generally aware that everything I'm looking at is God. But I also have many moments throughout that day where I'm just running on autopilot and sucked into the dualistic world.
</p>

<p>
	I certainly cannot sustain a 5-MeO-DMT peak. That level of consciousness is just off the hook. The physical body struggles to cope with it.

<p>
	Yes, of course psychedelics cause your visual field to melt. That's what you call distortions. This is mostly a distraction. It's a cool effect but not too spiritually significant. Focus on probing the luminosity instead.
</p>

<p>
	What's really happening is that the psychedelic is lubricating your mind, softening it up from its usual concrete stranglehold. As the mind softens up like warm clay, it becomes malleable, wavy, and flexible.
</p>

<p>
	Taking a psychedelic is like melting an ice cube from solid to liquid to gas.
</p>

<p>
	As your mind becomes more liquid your visual field starts to melt. It becomes unstable, giving you access to Infinite Imagination. This is why you start seeing faces in the carpet and so forth. As the mind becomes more fluid your literally start to materialize your thoughts. If you think of demons you will start to see demon faces in the carpet, and so forth.
</p>

	Funnily enough, I have been resisting stickying this because I feel that most people ignore stickied threads over time.
</p>

<p>
	Life is so counter-intuitive that stickying a thread makes it less visible. What a sick world God has created! <img alt="xD" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/laugh.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/laugh@2x.png 2x" title="xD" width="20" />

</p>

<p>
	If you probe deeper into what that luminosity actually is, you'll discover it's pure Emptiness, Nothingness, or Void. That is the Groundless Ground or Buddhamind. Your Original Face.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms make you very aware of this Void. Basically all psychedelics do.
</p>

<p>
	Technically it's not a sensation. It is Truth or Pure Consciousness. You gotta probe deeper into it next time you trip. Contemplate: What is this luminosity? while you trip. You will eventually realize that it's totally empty and indistinct. This is pure existence devoid of form. This is the Absolute Formless, the Godhead.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, this luminosity is present right now in your direct experience! The Now IS pure formless luminosity!
</p>

<p>
	So you don't even need to be tripping on mushrooms to access it. It's always here and NOW. Mushrooms just make it easier to notice.
</p>

<p>
	Your thinking is very black and white.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to living totally in the truth to enjoy life.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta find some ways to enjoy life. All of this spiritual work is ultimately just a way of learning how to enjoy life. It's not about living in some cave and being a hardcore monk. That is only done for a temporary period as a means to an end.
</p>

<p>
	You can practice enjoying life right now. You don't have to finish your enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Structure your life in ways that make you feel good about yourself. I don't mean shooting up heroin or partying every night. I mean more simple pleasures, like the pleasures of reading a good book, cooking a nice meal, going fishing on the weekend, going for a road trip, listening to some good music, practicing some cool hobby, etc.
</p>

<p>
	There are many ashrams around the world. In India, in Costa Rica, and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try to find a more laid back job which is either more enjoyable to do or gives you more free time. When you have a business that you enjoy doing, life becomes a lot sweeter.
</p>

<p>
	I spend a lot of time on my work, but I love it so it rarely feels like work. That's the key to work. You gotta do something you find meaningful.
</p>

<title>Leo is Wrong About Trump - Accountability Predictions</title>

			<i>All of them </i>say they want:  complete amnesty + citizenship for everyone + free medical benefits.
		</p>

		<p>
			That means no consequences - and effectively - open borders.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, that is NOT open borders. Our borders are enforced and always have been enforced, even under liberal presidents. The threat of deportation and other problems are always there for illegals.
</p>

<p>
	Amnesty + citizenship is the same issue. Amnesty was done under Regan and even many conservatives are okay with amnesty as long as the border is enforced.
</p>

<p>
	The problem of amnesty isn't really a liberal one, it's a practical one. What do you do with 10 million+ illegals who've been here for years? Deporting them all would be unworkable, expensive, damaging to the economy, and cruel. So that leaves us with 2 options: 1) do nothing, 2) amnesty.
</p>

<p>
	Amnesty usually involves paying fines and making other contributions to society.
</p>

<p>
	Illegals pay sales tax, local tax, and payroll taxes while not receiving social security, Medicare, or other benefits. So to say that they will get free medical benefits is not quite right. And if illegals are given amnesty, they then pay into the system just like everyone else, so their medical benefits are not free.
</p>

<p>
	And finally, it's not like you have a solution to illegals coming to the USA. They will come anyway. Most illegals are visa overstays from airports, not border crossings. No wall is going to stop it. Walls will just be climbed over or under, or flown around. So the problem of illegals will remain.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to stop illegals then the only workable solution is to provide massive help to their home countries to boost their governments and economies. That would be a great long-term strategy. The US could loan those countries money similar to the Marshall Plan for rebuilding Europe.
</p>

<p>
	The only other option is a heavily militarized border like North/South Korea. But that's quite barbaric. Policing that entire border rigorously would waste more money than it's worth.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a serious misunderstanding of Spiral Dynamics. SD stages are not good or evil. It's just relative degrees of awareness and development.
</p>

<p>
	The reason some people don't like SD is if they find themselves low on the scale and then judge themselves that that is bad and unacceptable. But SD never said you are bad for being at a lower level.
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing evil about saying that person X is in 3rd grade while person Y is in 12th grade.
</p>

<p>
	Development Psychology and Spiral Dynamics help us understand one another better. It's the exactly opposite of calling people evil.

</p>

<p>
	Think of it as nothing changes visually. Just awareness increases and sense of self collapses or expands.
</p>

<p>
	It feels like being hyper-present. You become so present & aware that you literally see through the substance of physical reality. What once looked physical now seems like a hologram. Physical objects appear empty, like a hallucination or a mirage. You can see them still, but they lack reality. It can also feel like the air got sucked out of the room. Everything becomes crystal clear and luminous.
</p>

<p>
	It also feels like divinity and pure magic.

</p>

<p>
	When doing a retreat, be crystal clear about what you're doing and what the parameters are.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be jerking off in your Mom's basement and calling that a retreat. A retreat is when you're meditating/inquiring 24/7. Or in the case of psychedelic retreats it's back to back days of deep tripping.

This is very substantive and important stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with such sloppy false equivalencies.
</p>

<p>
	If you think that what I'm doing here is just the ideological opposite of what Fox News is doing, you've got much to learn and you are contributing to the problem.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a topic is polarizing and emotional does not make it any less important. In fact it's all the more important because people do not know how to think properly about polarizing issues. They tend to either take one side or do a sloppy false equivalency, both of which are dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	Ignoring poltical questions is not an option if we care about consciousness. Actualized.org could not exist under a regressive government. When monsters come to power they tend to silence and repress the intellectuals and wisest people.

<p>
	Your position is not quite racist but it is enthocentric. Small minds think ethnocentricly. What you're doing is defending an identity you constructed. But you want to deny it. But I am pointing it out to you that you are in denial about it. But the nature of denial is that you will deny that you are in denial. So here we are. You are stuck in Tier 1. I am trying to communicate to you from Tier 2. But you do not understand Tier 2 because you have an enormous amount of consciousness work to do. And of course you do not want to do it, so you make this about me. If your mind succeeds in making this about me, then you won't have to grow. Which is just perfect for your ego's survival.
</p>

<p>
	Do not underestimate the sophistication with which your own mind is tricking you. Nothing your mind says can be trusted. Your mind is a blind survival machine and it spins your ideology.

<p>
	I address libertarianism a lot because no mater how extreme or moderate it is, the people who hold such an ideology are very common today. Especially stage Orange young males. They get trapped by this ideology because they have a deep lack of experience and understanding of political history and they want to assert their individualism come what may.

<p>
	Mindlessness is relative thing. People here are way more mindful, on average, than the general population or Trump voters.
</p>

<p>
	The important difference is that people here are interested in being more mindful. Trump supports are generally not.
</p>

<p>
	Being ignorant or mindless is not so bad. What's really bad is being aggressive and stubborn in one's ignorance and mindlessness. And Trump is promoting a culture of aggressive mindlessness & selfishness. People actually feel righteous about being so ignorant. This is a dangerous and pathological development which must be challenged.

<p>
	What you're overlooking is that without a bureaucracy there cannot be a highway at all.

<p>
	Of course! That's the whole point! Not privileged but you must develop through the lower stages by meeting and integrating various low level needs.
</p>

<p>
	The fruits of Blue & Orange are definitely necessary. The problem is that Blue & Orange are becoming pathological to the point where the whole planet is in danger.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with a desperate homeless person is precisely that he cannot take any higher level concerns seriously because he's so needy he can only care about himself. So the solution is help elevate as many such people as possible by helping them to meet their basic needs, so they stop being desperate. That desperation is making them unconscious and unable to consider larger ecological issues.
</p>

<p>
	Ecological concerns are not a privilege. If the planet's ecology crashes, millions of the poorest and more desperate people will die. It's already happening, you're just not aware of it because you haven't studied these issues seriously enough.
</p>

<p>
	Drop your ideological opposition and maybe you can learn something here and advance to a whole new level of understanding.

	I didn't say he was enlightened. I said God-like. God-like comes in many degrees and is relative to one's era and culture.

<p>
	You don't have to be enlightened to be a good #2 leader. Bernie Sanders is a good example. He's far from enlightened but he is more God-like (i.e., selfless & compassionate) than most politicians of his time.

</blockquote>

<p>
	But that's the sick twisted irony of this whole situation. Trump is financially irresponsible so electing him reduces economic stability in the same way Bush crashed the economy with deregulation & tax cuts.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation hurt many of the poorest people.
</p>

<p>
	The people who vote for Trump are mindless precisely in the sense that they have an economic ideology which ends up shooting itself in the foot. They assume that unfettered capitalism will solve all problems (as their ideology promises them), but this just isn't the case because society and the economy are complex systems which work in counter-intuitive ways.
</p>

<p>
	People do not vote for Trump due to economics. They vote for him based on their gut feeling, because they resonate with his values and level of consciousness. Economics is a retroactive rationalization. The economy was improving and doing well under Obama. This is irrelevant to the Trump voter because economics is just an excuse. What drives them is their stage of cognitive and moral development. Don't let their retroactive rationalizations fool you. They themselves do not actually understand why they voted for Trump or are attracted to him. What they tell themselves are pleasant stories.
</p>

<p>
	It is very important to see through these stories and excuses.
</p>

<p>
	The poorest people actually voted more for Hilary than Trump. Trump's voters are in it for the culture war. Which is why Trump and Fox News are always playing up the culture war. Trump voters do not have a keen sense of policy. A vote for Trump is really a way for people who detest liberalism to spit in the eye of liberals. That's the whole emotional appeal of Trump. Trump is a "fuck you" to the "global elites". But of course the sick irony is that Trump is the fattest, greediest global elite there is because he loves money, sex, fame, power, and success no matter the cost.
</p>

<p>
	Poor people voting for a man who has a golden toilet in his house and lost $400 million dollars of daddy's money is the devil's sickest joke.

			The moment I read this, it finally clicked... I realized that real visionary leadership is leadership that inspires other people to think critically and more consciously. That’s what creates real collective change. Motivating individuals that empower them to take on greater concern than just their petty life...

<p>
	To help you deepen that insight, there are basically two kinds of leadership:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Rally people towards selfishness using fear
	</li>
	<li>
		Rally people towards selflessness using love
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	It really is that simple. Of course there are many degrees of both. Most leadership is somewhere in the middle. Exceptional leadership is #2. And #2 is so rare precisely because is cannot be faked. The leader must lead by example by himself being selfless and loving, which is impossible for a big ego to do. Which is why human history is filled with examples of such terrible leaders. But also a few exceptional ones. Exceptional #2 leaders become deified as gods. Because they literally must be God-like to lead that way. Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, Muhammad, Gandhi, MLK, etc. Unconscious people are incapable of such leadership nor are they capable of electing such people into positions of power. Those who get elected tend to be the most ambitious, ruthless, and manipulative ones. Rarely a selfless person will get elected, but he will quickly be demonized and kicked out of power by the selfish people who feel threatened by his selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	The thing that selfish people hate the most is displays of selflessness. Because it makes them look bad.

	Listening to podcasts is not a retreat.
</p>

<p>
	A retreat is a serious undertaking. Don't turn it into a mockery. Otherwise you're fooling yourself by telling yourself you did a retreat when you were really just driving in your car and listening to podcasts.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing wrong with driving or podcasts, but a solo retreat it is not.

</p>

<p>
	I did 13 trips over 13 consecutive days. By the end of it I was so deep mindfucked that fear of doing it became irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	It's normal to get a bit of anxiety prior to taking the substance. But once it's took, then just enjoy the ride.
</p>

<p>
	At certain levels of consciousness fear becomes untenable.

<p>
	Awakening is not a belief and cannot be embodied through any kind of actions or mental manipulations.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to understand awakening is to awaken. This requires a radical shift in consciousness.

<p>
	Psychedelics can help you quickly see how much you're missing.

<title>Asking girls before kissing them?</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13429-mada_/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13429" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13429-mada_/" rel="">@Mada_</a> There is no such need.
</p>

<p>
	All you need is to make direct eye contact and move your body/face within a foot of her's. If she doesn't hold eye contact or tries to lean away, she's not receptive. If she gives you puppy-dog eyes, then that's your green light.
</p>

<p>
	One final trick is to slowly brush her hair to the side with your fingers, and slowly run your fingers down her jaw line. If she flinches, she's not receptive and do not kiss her. If she maintains eye contact then she definitely wants to be kissed.
</p>

<p>
	Really, it's all about the eye contact. Look at her erotically in the eyes and hold it steady. If she maintains it, it's on boy!
</p>

<p>
	Another trick is if you go in for the kiss and she refuses it by leaning away. You brush it off as though nothing bad happened and try again 5-10 mins later. Keep trying even if she is resisting. Eventually she should relent.
</p>

<p>
	It's also important to time the moment. The mood has to be right. The best time to go for a kiss is after you've made her laugh. When she's in a good mood, she'll be much more receptive.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't make it a big deal. Don't make it some formal, stiff thing. The mood has to be light and casual so there is no nervousness or awkwardness about it.
</p>

<p>
	When you go for the kiss, decide on it and commit 100%. The worst thing you can do is be seconding-guessing yourself in your mind and half-assing it. Just assume that she wants it and that it will succeed. Don't be playing images of failure in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	If a girl is on a date with you, she's already agreed in her mind that she is willing to sleep with you. Otherwise she would have never agreed to the date in the first place. So all you gotta do is not be awkward or creepy.
</p>

<p>
	You need to build comfort and ease by doing lots of touching throughout the date. Then kissing is easy and natural. It is awkward and creepy when you go for half the date without a single touch. Get your hands around her body ASAP. You gotta be finding excuses to touch her all throughout the date. Tickle her and so forth in a playful way to break the ice.
</p>

<p>
	And finally, if you wanna use words, rather than asking, the better way is to declare it: "You look yummy. I feel like kissing you now." You must say it in a way where you are not fishing for her permission but stating your genuine desire and intention.
</p>

<title>Is deep sleep the Absolute?</title>

<p>
	If something is Absolute, it is everything and everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	So the funny thing is, there is nothing but the Absolute. You can't escape it or avoid it. You are enmeshed in it at all times no matter what is happening.

	DPT probably has more potential for a bad trip for average people.

<p>
	No, actual Truth is not a concept, thought, idea, or perspective. It is what is.
</p>

<p>
	Conceptual truths are partial and never complete. Conceptual truths are relative and subjective.

<p>

<p>
	No necessarily.
</p>

<p>
	First, access infinite intelligence, and then let's talk.

			Sort of like when you think you want 2 different things, e.g. you want to live both an expressive life and a passive life of meditation. One might think that those are conflicting interests only if they didn't see that they are complementary truths. One wouldn't make much sense without the other, and thus they can not just coexist, but they actually create a richness in what would otherwise be a rather bland experience (only appreciation would be rather colourless, and only expressivity wouldn't be very worthwhile).
		</p>

		<p>
			It just seems to me that there is always an integration possible that includes two seemingly contradictory goals, in a manner that doesn't exclude anything (making it not a compromise, but a win-win situation).
		</p>

		<p>
			Since reality is completely logical (meaning any statement can only be derived from a prior statements), doesn't that mean that complete falsehood is metaphysically impossible? I.e. regardless of how inclusive this statement is of other perspectives, it is still true relative to the goals of perspective that imagined them.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Your thinking is quite muddled here.
</p>

<p>
	Many of your assumptions are groundless. Awakening is not about integrating various human worldviews.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

			As such, when you say that the goal of the devil to spread ignorance, I interpret that as that their goal is to raise confusion (muddying of the waters as you call it). Yet what I'm claiming is that for every attempt the devil makes to do this, it should be possible that to instead of fighting his claims through force (which is the very same process the devil uses right?), instead an integration with this truth is possible that creates a higher truth which is inclusive of both truths, making it impossible for anyone listening to fight this truth because there is no logical denying it possible. The ultimate extrapolation of this would be a truth so all-inclusive that it includes everything that can ever be said, every story that can ever happen, etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There are far too many deluded worldviews on this planet to take them all seriously. You have limited time and attention. If you take every fool on this planet seriously, you will never awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Cut the shit and go straight for awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Access the Absolute Truth. Access Infinite Intelligence. It's possible. I've done it. Many others have too. There's nothing to debate here. You either do the practices or you are just clowning around.
</p>

<p>
	That's what this entire thread is, clowning around.

</p>

<p>
	But honestly, it sounds to me like you're just making too big a deal out of it.
</p>

<p>
	A small to medium dose of 5-MeO should be fine.
</p>

<p>
	I find 5-MeO-DMT to be a very benign and straight-forward process. It's just like cranking up the consciousness dial in your head to 11. Relax and enjoy the pure consciousness. It might take a few trips to get comfortable with it.

If only it were so easy! Truth is much more tricky than that.
</p>

<p>
	If I were to compromise with a materialist devil, I would only debase myself. It's the devil's strategy to get you to compromise with him. He will kick and scream to get you to take him seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all that a devil has to do to win is muddly the waters. That's the game here. The devil cannot win in actuality because he is coming from falsehood. The devil wins by getting you distracted from Truth and Love.

<p>
	There is nothing but states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the only thing that exists.
</p>

<p>
	To criticize something as a state of consciousness is just silly, since things can't be anything else.
</p>

<p>
	All criticism occurs within a state of consciousness. If you deny what I'm saying, that too is a state of consciousness. So there's no escaping consciousness. State of consciousness dictates physical reality, biology, and everything else. Your biology is just a state of consciousness. If your heart is beating right now, that's a state of consciousness you are in. Change the state and your heart will disappear like it never existed.

<p>
	It's good for you guys to see both the incredible bullshit of religion, and the incredible value of religion. That's the twisted paradox of it.
</p>

<p>
	Try to hold both views in your mind at the same time. It's good for stretching the mind.

<p>
	There is value in what Ralston and Sadhguru both have to say.

<p>
	With love, empathy, and compassion.
</p>

<p>
	Confront reality as it is. A big part of reality is that it can be ruthless and tragic. That's what makes it feel "real".
</p>

<p>
	Embrace the tragedy of it. That's part of its stark beauty.

<p>
	Go turn on the burner in your kitchen and try to stick your hand as close to it as you can.
</p>

<p>
	As you do that, ask yourself: What is the function of suffering?
</p>

<p>
	You'll get an answer real quick without a lot of mental masturbation.
</p>

<p>
	This work is not about theories. This work requires that you observe actuality.

<p>
	The trick is that if the mind imagines that something has meaning, then it does.
</p>

<p>
	So the irony is, people who deeply imagine Jesus can actually materialize Jesus. Of course the problem is that they then fool themselves into thinking that that's the only way.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine that Sanskrit is valuable, then it becomes so.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine that Sanskrit is just some sounds, then it becomes so.
</p>

<p>
	The key is becoming conscious of how you're imagining all this. What are you giving meaning to?
</p>

<p>
	For example, Ralston gives meaning to martial arts. But is martial arts any less silly than going to a shrine? What is martial arts really? It's the silliest thing in the world if you think about it. Two monkeys fighting each other to be top monkey. Why?
</p>

<p>
	Then again, why do anything? So long as you're alive you gotta occupy your time somehow.

	Evil doesn't exist!

<p>
	Evil if what "you" -- an ego self -- has labeled stuff which threatens your existence as an ego self.
</p>

<p>
	Fortunately the ego-self is not real, so it cannot really be harmed. Harm is illusory. But it sure feels real from your POV. That's the power of ego. Ego imagines evil. This is the cost of being born. You can't be born without dying.

<p>
	You are confusing your ego self with God.
</p>

<p>
	God proper has no needs or lack.
</p>

<p>
	Any need or lack you feel is simply the human ego self striving to survive. As a human you have real needs to stay alive. So go ahead and satisfy some of them. Just don't get too lost in a never-ending quest of satisying survival needs as that is a road to hell.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you should go make some friends.
</p>

<p>
	But God proper is above such things.
</p>

<p>
	Turning inwards and facing loneliness is a good spiritual practice, but it's an advanced practice for people who are ready for such things. It's not a solution to socialization problems.

<p>
	It would be rather selfish to hoard all that love for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Think about this very simply in human terms: if you just won the lottery for infinite dollars, what would you do? You'd give it all away to your family and loved ones. Why? Because it's fucking infinite! You've got nothing you lose!
</p>

<p>
	How petty would you have to be to not share it?
</p>

<p>
	What is the point of being an all-powerful God if you cannot share your Beauty and Goodness with everyone?
</p>

<p>
	Can you think of anything better for God to do? What would you do if you were God? Seriously. Think about it. What would you do?
</p>

<p>
	In the end you will come to this one conclusion: there is nothing else for God to do but share its infinite love. There can be no higher purpose. Any other purpose would not be worthy of God.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, God has no needs. What would you do if you had absolutely no need or lack? You'd radiate Love!
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	P.S. God IS bathing in Love for all of eternity. That bath is your experience. God loses nothing by creating you. You ARE God's Love!
</p>

<p>
	If you truly love yourself, why not touch yourself? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	Because I recognize that all symbols are relative and arbitrary. They make sense within a given system. They have as much meaning as you give them.
</p>

<p>
	God invents and understands all symbols. And its understanding goes even deeper than anything symbols can depict.
</p>

<p>
	If you like my symbols, cool, but also don't take them too seriously, in the same way that you don't want to get too attached to a single language.

<p>
	No amount of psychedelics can help so long as the person maintains the context of "it's all just wacky stuff happening in the brain." That materialist anchor must be challenged until it is realized that the brain was merely a conceptual fabrication.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it takes radical openmindedness to even take such a possibility seriously. It just does not occur to most people that their brain could be a hallucination. Let alone all of material reality, let alone their birth as a self.
</p>

<p>
	This is radical work we're doing here folks. The mindfuck of it is epic beyond description. It is twisted as fuck.

You can visualize every day whatever new belief you want to have. But you must visualize it daily for weeks & months for it to be effective. Once or twice will not work.

<p>
	There are many options.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering mindfully is a very direct path towards awakening, but it's hard to do precisely because it involves the thing you hate most: lots of suffering!
</p>

<p>
	Or you could do some other spiritual practice like meditation, yoga, psychedelics, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The following videos might help you:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		How To Deal With Strong Negative Emotions
	</li>
	<li>
		Awareness Alone Is Curative
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Psychedelics are a great way to learn about suffering.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	But see, you don't like that. You want to transcend suffering but stay an ego. That cannot happen. You have to completely surrender until you realize you were never born. At which point you become immortal.
</p>

<p>
	You die by realizing you were never born. That thing you think you are -- it's imaginary. Like Santa Claus. This must be directly realized. This realization is what we call awakening/enlightenment around here. It's like realizing that Santa Claus never existed. The only difference is that instead of Santa Claus, it's YOU!
</p>

<p>
	You cannot end suffering without awakening.
</p>

<p>
	This was the Buddha's great teaching.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you'll need to go even deeper than awakening. You'll need to also study and become deeply conscious of how survival dominates your entire life.
</p>

<p>
	To survive as a self! Suffering is the resistance of the self to dissolution.
</p>

<p>
	If you didn't suffer, you'd literally die and become God.
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>Suffering is the activity you invented to keep yourself from merging with God!</strong></u>

<p>
	Suffering is survival.
</p>

<p>
	To stop suffering you'd have to transcend survival. But you don't know anything other than survival, so you're stuck.
</p>

<p>
	Even your desire to escape suffering is a form of survival, which of course just ends up creating more suffering.
</p>

<p>
	You are guys are not taking survival seriously enough as a topic. There is no more important topic to understand than survival.
</p>

<title>Reconciling Stage Green Productivity</title>

</p>

<p>
	This is not to say Green stops getting work done, but that macho desire to out-work all your competitors takes a back seat to building and enjoying relationships with human beings.
</p>

<p>
	So maybe rather than working overtime to publish 100 research papers, you devote more of your time to working one on one with your students and you become known as the most beloved professor by your students.
</p>

<p>
	Just an example.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, relationships can be powerful. Deep relationships can open many doors for you in life, so you may not have to work as hard.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, nothing wrong with work as long as it aligns with your values. Your work should be working towards embodying or spreading Green values. Then you'll be motivated. Instead of personal achievement and success, Green is more motivated to help people / environment.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I work a lot less than I used to when my center of gravity was Orange. Today I make a lot of time for chilling out, tripping, contemplation, and deepening my connection to God. This would be unthinkable to an Orange person. I still do work, but it happens more organically at a deeper level. There's less raw output, but more depth and enjoyment. I'm less neurotic about work. My sense of self is less identified with the quantity of work I do.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Hehe, that's a tough one. Academia is not generally open to that. Maybe you should reconsider being in academia. That's what I did. I have no desire to play their games.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, there certainly are ways to make it work.
