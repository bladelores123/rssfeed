	All immigration and refugee issues are part of globalization. As the world gets more interconnected people move around more, destablizing old ethic boundaries and identities. If this went on long enough all the races would blend into one.

<p>
	Make sure you don't undersell your progress. It's easy to forget how much we grow, especially if we grew a lot.
</p>

<p>
	It's good to remind yourself once in a while how unconscious you used to be.

<p>
	It's all relative.
</p>

<p>
	Doing it is better than not doing anything at all. But it's better to be your own shaman if you can manage that.
</p>

<p>
	What matters is the substance, not the shaman. The shaman is a middleman. Why do you want a middleman between you and God?

<p>
	Cenk the one of the biggest leaders in passing a constitutional amendment to get money out of politics. This is the #1 issue. He needs all the support he can get. Nothing else is as important. Even Bernie is not as good on this issue as Cenk. He founded Wolf-Pac.
</p>

<p>
	Cenk winning would be bigger than AOC.

	It's to be expected since we have a strong trend to globalization which cannot be stopped and which threatens peoples' sense of identity. Nationalism is the backlash of an ego that doesn't know how to cope with this trend.

<p>
	Anything should be smokable if you use the right technique. The trick is not burning it. Sandwhiching it between neutral mullein leaves is probably your best chance.

<p>
	This is clearly false.

<p>
	Kundalini can obviously be awakened by pranayama and shaktipat. As well as psychedelics and other means.

<p>
	Are there dangers to awakening kundalini? Sure. Do your research before doing it.

<p>
	The ultimate solution is to realize that your identity extends to encompass the entire Universe, which of course includes your rapist and any others who harmed you. To realize that all that is YOU! And that you are Love.
</p>

<p>
	This requires a mystical experience of Self & Love. Best way to get it quickly is through a psychedelic like mushrooms, LSD, ayahausca, or San Pedro cactus.
</p>

<p>
	Who knew that the cure your trauma could be sitting in a pot at Home Depot? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> Better than wasting years in therapy.
</p>

<p>
	Mystical experiences have a profound healing power unlike anything which you can accomplish through the ordinary state of mind, reading books, listening to experts, or doing techniques. You need to access a level of love deeper than your trauma. The deeper the trauma, the deeper the required love to heal it.
</p>

<p>
	Confronting the person is not necessary once you confront your SELF.
</p>

<p>
	Once you access Divine Love, you will have a powerful capacity for compassion and mercy, which you will use to understand and forgive your abuser.

	Your question assumes unfoldment across time, a process, and a difference between folded and unfolded. These are still subtle dualities which must be transcended.

<p>
	There is a database problem. We're working to fix it. We may end up with a day or two of data lost.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for bringing it to my attention.

<p>
	This would be easy if everyone agreed on what "bad" is. But bad is relative and there are many competing interests in this game. What's bad for you might be great for me, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	So which way should we move? Who gets to say?

<p>
	It's a good question.
</p>

<p>
	Conservative values have importance, such as: courage, independence, hard work, commitment, discipline, faith, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you don't skip over stage Blue. That's basically what Jordan Peterson's redeaming message is.

<p>
	Air IS regulated and should be regulated a lot more.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you appreciate the value of regulation. Otherwise you might end up raped.
</p>

<p>
	It's fun to talk about no regulations until you realize that means someone will manipulate the whole thing against you. There are a lot of selfish devils around.

<p>
	It makes sense once you realize the power of the mind, will, and visualization.
</p>

<p>
	Some monks do such hardcore visualization practice that they can transfrom "physical" things. The more conscious you become the more powerful your will becomes.

<p>
	Be very suspicious when your mind supplies "he's a psychopath" as an explanation for anything.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishly pursuing survival is not psychopathy, it's standard operating procedure for all organisms. Just because you find it offensive doesn't make it psychopathy.

	There are many Silicon Valley types who like to pretend they are Green when really they are ORANGE-green because they are caught up in chasing money, success, fame, sex, etc.
</p>

<p>
	ORANGE-green is the dominant cultural norm right now in big cities.
</p>

<p>
	It's the difference between neo-liberals and serious progressives. The difference between someone like Bill Clinton and Bernie or AOC.

<p>
	Creating a just and fair society is very, very complicated and challenging. Which is precisely why it hasn't yet been done. If the solutions were easy it would have been done 1000 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	We've been trying for over 10,000 years and still no one has figured out how to do it at the scale of 100s of millions of people.
</p>

<p>
	But we have gotten a lot better. It's an evolutionary process.

<p>
	It is not government resistant at all. Government now regulates most of the exchanges and access points, and government is fully capable of tracking your BitCoin transactions through the public blockchain. So watch out.
</p>

<p>
	Governments are never going to allow an unregulated currency. They will regulate all the access points to it.

<p>
	Like all technology it can be used for good or for evil, depending on the level of consciousness of the user.
</p>

<p>
	Technology itself is always just a mechanical thing. What matters is the intent of the user.
</p>

<p>
	Of course powerful technologies must always be regulated because devils will want to abuse it.
</p>

<p>
	There is a lot of potential for abuse within BitCoin. Which is why devils gravitate towards it.
</p>

<p>
	No crypto currency will ever be allowed to go unregulated because it would be too dangerous to society. There are good reasons that banks and large transactions are regulated. Too many people would otherwise get exploited.

	No it won't. You're exaggerating things.

<p>
	Worse case scenario just move to another town and change your number.

<p>
	You can always pay him back in the future and make things right.
</p>

<p>
	There is no value in killing yourself. You will make so much money over your whole lifetime.

<p>
	You can even write him a heart-felt letter explaining your situation and why you had to leave town.

<p>
	Well, your view is one-dimensional and naive.
</p>

<p>
	Distributing value that people did not earn is itself theft.
</p>

<p>
	People own their labor, but not all people labor equally nor produce equal results.
</p>

<p>
	If you work hard to create something of significant creative value, you will understand why some low-level grunt should not own half of your life's work.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with taking the socialist ideology too far. And it is an ideology. It's not something you've careful deduced yourself from years of personal experience.
</p>

<p>
	Labor is not merely a matter of hours spent. Labor has to be genuinely creative and value-generating. So you can own your labor but if your labor is licking stamps, you don't deserve much compensation for that. Labor is highly unequal. Some labor is worth 1000x more than other labor.

<p>
	Be careful judging your results so directly.
</p>

<p>
	The opposite might easily be the case. As kundalini activates you can get crazy monkey mind as the body/mind purifies itself. You must endure such things if you want serious results.
</p>

<p>
	Peace of mind is a byproduct of deep purification. The purification process itself can be uncomfortable and agitated. That's actually a sign that it's working, not a sign of failure.

<p>
	This is very foolish. Just face the person and try to make things right. You will feel much better. To hinge your life on money is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	What's imaginary is your fear about money and facing this person.
</p>

<p>
	No enlightened truths are relevant for you because none of them are part of your direct experience. Enlightened truths only help you if you are conscious of them, and clearly you are not. By killing yourself you will put yourself through hell because you are not conscious enough to understand what you're doing.

<p>
	It felt gentle because you did a tiny dose of DPT.
</p>

<p>
	20mg of 5-MeO-DMT is equivalent to maybe 70mg of DPT.

<p>
	25mg of DPT is nothing. It should barely be felt at this dose.

<p>
	That's not going to work.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of a relationship is to <u>grow together</u>. As soon as that stops working you're doomed.
</p>

<p>
	For a stable long-term relationship you must find a partner who is willing to grow with you. Otherwise why even be in relationship?
</p>

<p>
	Do not underestimate the seriousness of a value disconnect in a relationship. You are going to be able to ignore that and just keep things going. The value disconnect will infect everything eventually.

	You can find such a service but you should expect to spend more than $100. One session is not gonna be enough.

<p>
	Sounds to me like your unique skillset, passion, and level of consciousness would go to waste in a standard political position.
</p>

<p>
	You can make a powerful political impact with spirituality. But it will probably be a much less orthodox path.
</p>

<p>
	Look to Gandhi as a role-model of what's possible. You don't have to work within the system. You can help mobilize people from outside government to care about things like corruption, Green values, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's compatible, but you're gonna have to design your own niche to make it work.

<p>
	Men are attracted to all sorts of types. Which is why porn of every stripe exists. There are entire websites that cater to guys who like fat girls, skinny girls, tall girls, short girls, black girls, old girls, young girls, hairy girls, shaved girls, Asian girls, Muslim girls, Christian girls, even girls with dicks and a thousand other things.
</p>

<p>
	The less people judge such things, the better.

	If you want us to be separate you can have that too by imagining that you're not me.

<p>
	There are only two choices:
</p>

<p>
	1) Imagine that you're not me, then you're not alone.
</p>

<p>
	2) Realize that you are me, then we're together as One.

<p>
	Both are the case. It's like looking at a half-filled glass.

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	Aloneness just means oneness. And oneness just means unity with everything.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that you're alone and separated. It's that you're are so merged and united with everything that there's nothing you're not intimately connected with.
</p>

<p>
	When you are having sex, two unite and become one. And this one is then alone (only logical). But this aloneness is really just as close as two can ever get: a total Unity. So there's nothing to worry about. Don't think of sex as aloneness. Think of it as unity.
</p>

<p>
	What you really seek your whole life is Unity. And now you are like the dog that finally caught its own tail, only to realize, "Hey! But this is just a closed loop! It's all me! Now I have nothing else to unite with! Boo-hoo..."
</p>

<p>
	But don't forget, you are now fully united, so you don't need anything else to unite with! The circle is complete.

</p>

<p>
	It's almost like you've stuck your dick inside a nice warm vagina and then you say, "Oh man! This sucks! Now I have nowhere to stick my dick." You must realize that you've arrived! The chase is over.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, if you did a mind-meld with every living being in the universe, you'd be totally alone. How else could it be?

			Yes she wants to grow, but financially. And No she doesn't want to grow because she would rather choose external materialistic growth than internal spiritual growth.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To be fair, wanting to grow financially is still a form of growth (just a relatively low one). But hey, many people need to start low. Moving from Blue to Orange will often involve growing financially. Remember, financial growth is not simply about earning more cash. To really grow in this area usually requires some significant and serious mindset shifts. For example, for a person to go from working a 9-5 job to being a successful entrepreneur usually takes a lot of inner growth. It's not simply a matter of money. You have to start to think about the world and yourself differently.
</p>

<p>
	Starting a business is one of the best and most practical ways to grow yourself as a person, especially within Tier 1 of the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that many people who want more money do not even understand that money is a function of one's being. So when you ask them, "Do you want to grow as a person?" they don't make the connection between that and earning more money. They think they can just have lots of money while staying the same inside. Which would be disastrous even if it ever came to be.
</p>

<p>
	A powerful way to help people grow is to show them how things like money, sex, success, fame, a good relationship, a good family, good physical appearance, and happiness are best achieved through deep inner growth, not by chasing externals directly.
</p>

			I have watched a multitude of different videos including Leos "How To Be Attractive" and I have trouble understanding how that theory is implemented and manifested in day to day social interaction. I often find myself in awkward pauses and not knowing what to say. Should I be polite? Should I be disagreeable? Should I ask them questions about them? Should I talk about me? Should I run away from speaking about abstract topics? Should I be optimistic about everything? I don't know which way to behave, they all seem to not work. I also don't want to appear as a loner (which I very much am).
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Sounds to me like you just need much more experience socializing.
</p>

<p>
	Socialization is just like tennis. To get good at it you must have many opportunities to practice.
</p>

<p>
	So very practically you need to change your life around so that you have more socialization opportunities on a regular basis. The rest will mostly auto-correct.
</p>

<p>
	You can't get good at socializing if you're alone most of the time.
</p>

<p>
	There is no specific way that you must be when you socialize. You can basically be totally natural unless you're some kind of psycho, in which case you'll have to reign that in. Be chill, friendly, pleasant, playful, honest, expressive, and relaxed. That usually works best.
</p>

<p>
	You'll be amazed at how often people just accept you exactly for how you are. Perhaps the biggest mistake of learning to socialize is to try to act a certain way to please people or meet their expectations. Just be you. Not everyone will jive with you, but that doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
	Be comfortable in your own skin. Act with strangers the same way you'd act with close family. Assume everyone already knows each other. Don't try to act cool or impressive.
</p>

<p>
	As simple as all these things are, it can take years to learn. Especially if you've developed bad habits.
</p>

<p>
	That's a big if.
</p>

<p>
	And presence has many degrees. You can be 1000x more present than you are right now. And it's also a matter of consistency. Can you stay present for 1hr straight? If you could, you'd already be enlightened.

	Love isn't just something you value, Love is what you are.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to lose Love while you're so wrapped up in chasing sex.
</p>

<p>
	The thing you most want is the very thing you push away in your desperation to get it.
</p>

<p>
	But do whatever you gotta do to learn that lesson.

<p>
	Be careful to distinguish Love and sex/girls.

<p>
	The opposite is the real question: how can you have a relationship with anyone if you two are not one?
</p>

<p>
	A relationship is a kind of union.
</p>

<p>
	What you ultimately seek is Unity. So it's very fortunate that in fact everything is one.

And that's assuming they are doing some kind of active self-improvement work.
</p>

<p>
	Your time might be better spent helping other people who are eager to grow, rather than dragging a stubborn old mule up hill.
</p>

<p>
	A person cannot be forced to grow unless they are interested in growth.
</p>

<p>
	Before teaching someone, you might first want to ask them, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how interested are you in growing yourself as a human?"

	FYI, it takes most people 5 years to move up one stage. And that's assuming the person is doing some kind of personal development work. If they are just coasting through life, forget about it.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why changing people doesn't usually work.

<p>
	Sam Harris has seen the tip of the Ox's tail, but not the full Ox. In this case atheism can still be maintained.
</p>

<p>
	But if he ever saw the full Ox, he'd realize how wrong he was.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of seeing the Ox. To call someone awakened who's only seen the tip is very misleading.
</p>

<p>
	Realization of no-self is only the beginning. It's the least profound aspect of God.
</p>

<p>
	20 years of meditation means nothing. What matters is what insights one has reached.

<p>
	There are many practical problems with abolishing private ownership of businesses.
</p>

<p>
	Let's say you work for 5 years to start your business. Now it's successful. You want to hire a couple of low level employees. Do they now own part of your business? This would be quite problematic and unfair.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see either of these as being a problem for Yang. Yang would beat Trump. Yang's problem is that he will simply not get the Dem nomination due to lack of visibility.

			Love is what's True. The void is the mechanism that allows God to forget what it is????

		<p>
			To be honest I have never experienced God as Love, only as the void, and the void just gets more and more voidy. The world gets more and more hollogramish the more meditation that happens. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So it is hard for me to understand how the void is not True? The void is simply a mechanism for forgetting??? But isn't the fact that every object in the universe is hollow and made of nothingness True???
		</p>

		<p>
			Oh well, guess I'm doing too much zen, time to do some bhakti yoga.

			You say it like its obvious, I find this to be deeply interesting. This puts a whole new perspective on the importance of theory and belief! God wants to create infinite facets, so he creates infinite amount of beliefs, and gets lesser beings to set intentions on all these different beliefs, and wola infinite amount of facets created!

<p>
	No, it's not about belief. Intention is a separate matter.
</p>

<p>
	The intention is simply to experience what is most true. Not about having your beliefs validated. There aren't infinite facets, only a handful of key ones.

			I started to notice this phenomena by watching responses of trip reports in the forum. A lot of trip reports in the past were seeing the void. As soon as Leo made videos about love, people all of a sudden were tripping and feeling absolute love. Which made me hypothesise that these facets were being influenced by the belief system and teachings that a particular person followed. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, the Absolute is Absolute. It's not relative as you assume.
</p>

<p>
	Once you see all the facets you will understand why people disagree about them. Because few have seen them all.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not a belief and it is not influenced by anything.
</p>

<p>
	Of course what you contemplate and set your intention for drives which facet will be revealed to you. So in this sense, yeah, if you go into a trip desiring to know about love, you will be shown love rather than something else.

<p>
	Yellow vs Blue is a pretty big disconnect.
</p>

<p>
	Common values are the most important factor for making relationships work. Spiral colors are different sets of values.
</p>

<p>
	I would def stay away from Blue girlfriends. Not worth the headache.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't think Dems are interested in a centrist billionaire.
</p>

<p>
	Bloomberg has no base of support. The people who might support him already got Biden and Buttigeg, and the Warren and Sanders and Yang supporters will never accept Bloomberg.
</p>

<p>
	Bloomberg will not make any of the debates. He just wants to buy the election, which I think voters are too smart to tolerate. Bloomberg offers nothing new.
</p>

<p>
	The real problem here is that Bloomberg might simply use the Dems as a launching point for a 3rd party run, which could be a big problem in the general election. Seems like Bloomberg is not truly running to win the Dem primary but to set himself up as a 3rd party after the Dem is selected. There's just no way Bloomberg will overtake Bernie, Warren, or Biden. Biden may be a centrist but at least he's someone people can relate to. Bloomberg is gonna look like an elitist asshole. The Rust Belt is not going to vote for him.
</p>

<p>
	I think there's depth to any state of consciousness, and there is nothing but states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There are states of consciousness so nondual you would not be able to walk straight. Seems hard to make such things permanent. Usually one's baseline state will be much lower than a possible peak.
</p>

<p>
	But ultimately I don't know. It's a tricky topic since you need reference points of what's possible, and those are hard to come by and even harder to communicate and share.

<p>
	Sahaja Samadhi is the end goal: a permanent state of nondual awareness 24/7 regardless of what you're doing.
</p>

<p>
	You don't access it, you are in nonduality at all times. That's the ideal. And ideally you don't get lured out of it by cravings and attachments.
</p>

<p>
	Accessing special states would be icing on that nondual cake.

<p>
	Sadhguru is not in a no man's land of no perception in his regular life. That might be a state he enters when he sits in deep meditation, not while he's driving his motorbike.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be nuanced here. There are many possible states of consciousness with psychedelics, not just some one state called "enlightenment".
</p>

<p>
	There are various kinds of samadhi states which have been catalogued by mystics and gurus throughout the ages.

<p>
	It is what it is. Arguing with people is largely a waste of time. If you care about truth you will sit down and do the work.
</p>

<p>
	Question what reason is. Study what post-rationality is. Don't take my word for it. I just don't have 10 years to explain to you all the limits of reason. It is your job to figure that out. I just give quick pointers. Under each pointer might lie 5 or 10 years of study and contemplation. So of course without doing that the pointer will mean very little to you.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse this work with any kind of proof. We're not in the business of proof or argumentation, we're in the business of self-reflection and exploration of how our minds work.
</p>

<p>
	The only way you can learn how your mind works is by studying how your mind works. Not by listening to arguments.
</p>

<p>
	Everything worth knowing can be found directly in your experience, so there is no need to argue about it. Observation work is necessary.

<p>
	This is really a discussion about feminism, and a lack of understanding of it's historical development and function in society.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to start a thread about understanding feminism, go for it. But let's get not derail this thread any further with debates about the validity of feminism.
</p>

<p>
	This threat for posting more Stage Green examples, positive and negative ones. Remember, to understand Stage Green is not the same as saying it is the end-all-be-all and that it doesn't have its problems and limits. There are much higher worldviews than Green. But to not understand Green is an obstacle to reaching those. Green's validity needs to be acknowledged to go higher.

<p>
	There are truths so much more advanced and more important than science that they make science look like a joke.
</p>

<p>
	If you could access such truth you would stop wasting your time reading science or trying to convince scientists of their blindness.
</p>

<p>
	It is mistake to ask spirituality to lower itself to the gross material domain of science.
</p>

<p>
	There is an endless list of technical problems to solve and solving them does not really improve the human condition.

<p>
	The cheif function of reason is to realize its own limitations and go beyond itself to vision-logic and then even further to pure consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Reason eats its own tail if you question it deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	At post-rational even the notion of argument falls apart. There is nothing to argue and no one to argue with but yourself.
</p>

			But if its mainly geographical reasons what about the fact that many Americans are also at stage blue? Surely if the environment is similar throughout America the whole of the country would be at the same stage according to this way of thinking.

<p>
	It's far more complex than that.
</p>

<p>
	America has pockets of Blue. Lots of it in the South, which is of course a geographical factor. Rural America is much less developed than urban America.
</p>

<p>
	Amd rural parts of the Middle East are far lower than Blue. They are mostly Purple and Red.

<p>
	No problem here at all.
</p>

<p>
	The rational is being criticized from post-rational. Post-rational still uses reason but recognizes its limits, whereas the rational does not recognize the limits of reason. Which is Sam Harris' biggest problem.

<p>
	Love is the not result of structure, but structure is the result of love.
</p>

<p>
	Life has a very specific structure which has a logic to it.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying one part of reality is better than another. I am saying the entire thing as a whole works to maximize love.
</p>

<p>
	You are overlooking the intelligence that went into the design. This intelligence wasn't just dicking around, telling itself that nothing matters and spawning monstrosities. It had a goal in mind: to maximize the sharing of love / God.
</p>

<p>
	And then there's actually losing your mind. Which is not so great.
</p>

<p>
	Being different or weird is not the same thing as insanity. Actual insanity is terrifying.

All those 20 minutes are spent thinking how awesome was the day, how I should be more humorous, how I should be interacting with more girls, and how awesome would it be to talk a bit more with that cute girl and etc, you get the point.
		</p>

		<p>
			What would you advise in such a case? Literally all those 20 minutes are spent sitting still and mind just wandering to all those places, which I know are the needs that I haven't satisfied yet. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I think that keeping at least 20 minutes of meditation habit is a good starting point, and the main focus must be on keeping the habit, no matter what.
		</p>

		<p>
			What do you suggest?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, firstly, 20 mins is the bare minimum. It usually takes 20 mins just to calm the mind. So you could meditate longer.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, part of meditation practice is training to quickly let things go. It's a skill.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, you could even practice a bit of meditation while around people. Mindfulness shouldn't end out the door of your house.
</p>
