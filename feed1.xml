<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you were doing it in a creepy way.
</p>

<p>
	This almost never happens.
</p>

<p>
	If you are camping a small supermarket every day, yeah, you will probably arouse suspicions.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do lots of approaches you need a large high volume area like a mall or nightclub or sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
	Places like supermarkets require being highly selective. You can't be an approach machine there.
</p>

<p>
	Flirting with a stranger is not sexual harassment. Girls are used to being chatted up. If you do it right, the girl should feel flattered and pleased about herself. It's a huge ego boost for her to be desired. Just don't be creepy. Dress nice, smell nice, groom nice, and SMILE for fuck's sake. Do not approach girls without a big cheeky smile.
</p>

And so culture will evolve.
</p>

<p>
	Rape and pilage is self-defeating because karma is a bitch. You rape long enough, someone you love will get raped. And that will make you rethink rape.

<p>
	They could, if they seek publicity.
</p>

<p>
	Osho was great at it.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru got nothing better to do than fly around and charm people. He already finished his spiritual awakening process.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru is just executing his life purpose of awakening the ignorant masses. Publicity can be useful for this. Ignorant masses love stunts. If Sahguru shot a fireball out of his ass, they'd all be impressed and start doing his yoga.

<p>
	Don't limit karma to something that happened in the past. Karma is all your current habits.
</p>

<p>
	Your time is better spent becoming more conscious of all your present habits, emotional reactions, beliefs, attachments, fears, desires, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can't change the past. Work on the present.

Notice that as you draw the inside you simultaneously draw the outside. You cannot only draw the inside.
</p>

<p>
	That is how all dualities work. You cannot have an up without its opposite, you cannot have a beginning without its opposite.
</p>

<p>
	A division always creates two pieces. And what you're doing is dividing reality with your mind.

			This might be my problem. What do you think would be a wise approach to get those? I know you advocate psychedelics, but honestly I would have no idea how to get them from a trustworthy source. Also I don't really have someone to do it with, a trip sitter or something like that.

<p>
	This explains why Turquoise is inaccessible to you.
</p>

<p>
	Once you have your first psychedelic breakthrough, you will realize what a fool you've been pursing Yellow. Turquoise is where life begins. Everything else is like living like a dog.
</p>

<p>
	I would recommend that you have a psychedelic breakthrough by whatever means possible as soon as possible. Otherwise you just can't understand what you are missing. But of course responsibility for that is all on you. I cannot tell you want to do.

	You're basically not going to even understand those levels without becoming a full-time mystic/yogi/monk with decades of hardcore practice achieving crazy high mystical states.
</p>

<p>
	Those are the kind of things which cannot be written or talked about. You're gonna be all on your own. Don't expect any support, validation, or anyone to understand you.

	Sorry, cannot allow a teacher on here who denies the truth of Love and God. That kind of corruption is unacceptable no matter how helpful the person might otherwise be. His formulation of nonduality is simply incomplete.

<p>
	Anyone who denies Love as the highest teaching is simply not fully awake.

<p>
	I don't know what your deal is, but Yellow is close to Turquoise, so you don't need to actively avoid Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	All it should take to get you interested in Turquoise is a few solid mystical experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Turquoise is basically inaccessible without mystical experiences. Seems like you're lacking those.

</p>

<p>
	In your self-centeredness you interpret the message of "stop violence against women" as somehow taking resources away from men. Yet this message doesn't mean to ignore men's issues.
</p>

<p>
	You lack basic empathy for those who are not you.
</p>

<p>
	You are like a white guy in the colonial South who walks by a poster that says, "Stop slavery now!" and you say to yourself, "But why should I care about the slaves when white poor folk are hungry on the streets? How is helping slaves fair?"
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking that helping to elevate others somehow takes away from you. This is a scarcity mindset.
</p>

<p>
	By caring about women, you will increase your care for men. By helping animals you will also help the whole universe. << this is the proper attitude. Love is an unlimited resource, so you don't have to worry about holding it back.
</p>

Expect massive flakiness.
</p>

<p>
	A good way to test for flakes on the day of the date is to text her 1hr before you get in your car: "Doing some chores and then will head out." If she doesn't respond, you know she's gonna flake.
</p>

<p>
	If she's gonna go on a date with you, she needs to be responsive to texts.

<p>
	That's due to class similarities.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to use cultural disagreements to distract from class differences. So lots of simple-minded people end up supporting Trump for cultural reasons against their own class interests.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is clearly not going to help low income people because he's thinks they are scum.

<p>
	That's how it is. Takes a lot of practice to overcome that. Usually years of rigorous practice are required.
</p>

<p>
	This problem of boredom is existential. It goes very deep. It can't be avoided. The point of meditation is to face it directly, which creates suffering -- which is why hardly anyone meditates.

			Yet this is the tragedy of your situation: While you may be a world class scientist, and you understand all the physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms of red, you’re color blind and can only see on a greyscale. See, despite all of you’re intellectualizing and scientific investigation of this specific light phenomena, you’ve still missed a crucial component to what red *is* existentially. You’ve missed an experiential insight into what red is that no amount of science can help you with.

<p>
	That's a classic example from philosophy of mind / phenomenology. Unfortunately even when you give that example, people still ignore it. Materialism simply discounts all phenomena as "subjective" and therefore insignificant.
</p>

<p>
	A materialist scientist will simply not understand how seeing the color red has any importance to science. "Okay, so even if I miss the color red, so what? Doesn't change a thing."

It's more important to mobilize the progressive base.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Bernie and Yang have some cross-over, which is nice.
</p>

<p>
	But Biden does well against Trump in polls.
</p>

<p>
	Warren would probably have the hardest time. But then again, caring about what Trump voters think/want is not a top priority. They had their chance, they fucked it up, and they show little remorse.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump voters admitted their error, then maybe we could have more sympathy for them. But as long as they act like assholes and keep denying any wrongdoing, no deal. There need to be consequences for electing terrible leaders. You don't get to elect a terrible leader and then come back the next time and make demands about how you're not getting enough of what you want, expecting everyone cater to your priorities.
</p>

<p>
	Catering to Trump voters is not necessary to defeat Trump.

<p>
	Be careful holding demonization as a defining feature of Green. That's pathological Green.

<p>
	Love and forgiveness is the solution in such a case.
</p>

<p>
	What such a "test" is testing you for, is the breadth and depth of your love.
</p>

<p>
	If you fail the "test", that's okay too. You'll just suffer more.
</p>

<p>
	The cure to all forms of abuse is deeper self-love, both for the parent, the child, and the abuser.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive because when your survival is deeply threatened the last thing you want to do is love. It takes great wisdom, bravery, heart, and consciousness to be able to love in such situations. And therein lies the "test". Such situations reveal your true level of development. Highly developed beings are capable of embracing it with love. But of course this is rare among humans. We are a crude species.
</p>

<p>
	Deeper self-love is the cure to all trauma and injustice.

	In the ultimate sense, everything leads back to total oneness, so there is no problem. But it seems to take consciousness many incarnations to get there. I'm not saying suicide will damn you forever to hell. I'm saying it could be temporary set-back, slowing the overall process. There is nothing wrong with slowing the process, per se. It's all relative.

<p>
	By definition everything that happens is "God's plan". But not in the simplistic sense of everything being predetermined. God's plan is a meta plan which includes your human plans. You have the freedom to make your human plans.
</p>

<p>
	No choice is right or wrong. Any choice you make is fine from God's POV. God has no desire to manipulate you and no particular desired outcome.

<p>
	It's imaginary in the same way a brick wall is imaginary.

<p>
	The notion of "imaginary" is much more robust than most people think. It encompasses all of "physical reality". So just saying that something is imaginary doesn't automatically set you free of it.

<p>
	Nope. Humans clearly affect nature with our actions. Even if you decide to take no action, that will have an affect on nature. It is impossible to not take action. Even inaction is a kind of action.

			This is an exercise I do in one of my classes: I go to the chalkboard and tell the class I will ask them a question and I want them to call out ideas.  I then say “First I’ll ask the males in the class ‘Tell me all the actions you take on a daily basis to protect yourself from sexual harassment and sexual assault”. . . Silence. . . The guys look confused. . . They don’t know if this is a trick question. . . Sometimes I tease them and say “C’mon guys, don’t be shy - let it out”. Nothing. . . . Then I ask the woman the same question and they give rapid fire answers. I’m now writing as fast as I can on the board and can’t keep up with them.

<p>
	That's warm but doesn't hit the nail on the head.
</p>

<p>
	Your definition is not fundamental enough. It still requires activity like "recognizing" and "communicating", which is 2nd order stuff.
</p>

<p>
	1st order Love requires no action. 1st order Love is simply Being itself.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to think of it is like this: replace your notion that everything is made out of atoms to "everything is made out of love". Love is the very substance of physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	An exercise I like to do is to look at my hand and just remind myself that it's made out of Love. This reconnects me with Love, reminding me that it's more fundamental than an activity.

<p>
	As soon as you start rating happiness, you'll lose it.
</p>

<p>
	The proper answer is: who gives a fuck? Reality is whatever it is and you feel however you feel at any given moment. Don't confuse true happiness with mood. That can be a serious error.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to "lock in" a happy mood is very counter-productive. You are guaranteed to fail at that.
</p>

<p>
	If you want real happiness, stop caring whether you're dying or being tortured. Then you'll be happy. And nothing less than that will hold up.

<p>
	Karma is much more than fear mongering.
</p>

<p>
	This topic is too complex and advanced to discuss on a forum. You'd need decades of advanced spiritual practice to begin to understand such things and I'm nowhere near understanding all that.
</p>

<p>
	If you violently disrupt consciousness (via suicide), it's not unreasonable to expect a ripple effect which cascades from such an event, disrupting the evolution of consciousness. Don't think of it as a punishment, think of it as a natural consequence of self-rejection and self-hatred. How can consciousness continue its evolution if it hates itself so much it cannot even finish out one human life?

<p>
	That's a bit questionable. I'm not certain how much of Obama was Yellow or Orange/Green. It's hard to tell without knowing him more deeply.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, the higher a person is up the Spiral the harder he is to assess accurately because there is more uniqueness of expression at Tier 2.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie is definitely more progressive than Obama, so I see Bernie as a step up for American politics. He is certainly less acceptable to the mainstream than Obama. America has yet to elect a solid, powerful Green leader. Few people embody solid Green. It's one thing to dabble in Green, it's another thing to really master it as Bernie has.
</p>

<p>
	For America to elect a solid Green leader would be a massive step forward. And it would cause a serious backlash as well. Bernie will not be well tolerated by many people even if he is elected. Turbulent times are ahead as America is forced to go Green kicking and screaming. We need to solidify in Green before we start worrying too much about Yellow. Green is good enough for now.

</p>

<p>
	I don't rank consciousness on any linear scale because I feel that would be misleading.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that just because a book is on my book list doesn't mean I agree with it 100%. If that was my standard the book list would be empty. I expect you to read books and evaluate them using careful and nuanced discernment. No book can be trusted or followed blindly.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that spiritual paths can be very unique. Don't try to follow anyone else's way. Make your own way -- whatever that entails. My way entailed psychedelics and I don't regret it.

<p>
	It happens all the time. Tens of thousands of times per year.
</p>

<p>
	But don't assume the "respawn" is free and clear. There is very likely an enormous karmic debt that comes with suicide. So avoid it if you can.

	Try to be more nuanced in your thinking. Things aren't good or bad, valuable or valueless. It's all in the details.
</p>

<p>
	Tools of the mind need to be used properly to avoid traps and errors.

<p>
	A human being grasps and understands and deals with tiny portions of God. A human is like 0.0000000000001% of God and has that amount of power allocated to him/her. Humans thoughts affect reality, but in a very weak way.
</p>

<p>
	A human is like an App in an OS which has only been given access to a tiny percentage of the total system resources. It is not proper for a single App to have access to total system resources and root access. These limitations are there for your safety so you don't accidentally kill yourself and the entire Earth.

<p>
	These days YT is very over-saturated. You have no idea how competitive and manipulative marketing is. It's a blood sport. This is not a game. You are talking about money here. Tens of millions of dollars. People are ready to kill you for money. Never forget that.
</p>

<p>
	Internet success is highly manipulated behind the scenes in ways which most of you cannot imagine. It is a Wild West for hacking, spaming, bots, money exchanges, politics, deal-making, backstabbing, lying, manipulating, stealing, bribery, exploitation, etc. This is how business works. It's ugly behind the scenes. Do not assume that internet success is "natural". There's nothing natural about most of it.
</p>

<p>
	Many giant internet companies defrauded their way to success and all of it is kept secret, creating the illusion of "natural" growth.
</p>

This is not a flex. This is really advanced stuff that most humans cannot fathom or handle. You've sorta got yourself in the deep end here.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to keep in mind that most humans beings have the consciousness level not much higher than animals. So this stuff is not suitable for most people.

<p>
	You feel that way because you are so needy.
</p>

<p>
	When you get a really clingy girlfriend you will see that it repulses you. You will start to feel disgusted by her and even have desire to abuse and exploit her. She will start to feel almost sub-human to you.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously this can get very toxic and dangerous.

	Good, this is called Wu Wei, or effortless action.
</p>

<p>
	Your spirituality is skin deep if it is forced, premeditated, or mechanical. The key is to make it a seamless activity of your whole life, your natural way of being.
</p>

<p>
	Spontaneous action from a place of surrender and presence is the goal of all our work.

<p>
	Of course awakening helps with detachment in profound ways.
</p>

<p>
	But if you can't teach yourself to attract girls I would not trust you to be able to awaken yourself. That's much harder.
</p>

<p>
	Start with managing the easier stuff.

<p>
	Before you go spending a lot of money on that, I would doing a comprehensive blood work, check your hormone levels, and get a heavy metal provoked urine test using DMSA and ALA.
</p>

<p>
	Heavy metal toxicity is one of the leading causes of ADHD and other issues like that. You need to test for mercury, lead, arsenic, etc. If these chemicals are in your organs/brain they can serious decrease cognitive performance and cause all sorts of other problems.
</p>

<p>
	Blood testing for heavy metals is not good enough. A provoked urine test is necessary using DMSA and ALA.

<p>
	Because suffering is false, same as fear.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason you don't like suffering is out of selfishness. So by trying to end suffering you are doubling down on selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to suffering is to stop caring about it. Stop trying to escape it.

<p>
	Actually I never said that.
</p>

<p>
	You certainly can become enlightened that way. I just consider it an inferior motivation.
</p>

<p>
	The soul's desire for Truth/Love/Union is a higher drive than the escape of personal suffering. The soul actually doesn't care about suffering. Suffering is irrelevant in the end since it is a finite and relative illusion.

	You are inside a hallucination. You have imagined your birth, your family, the Earth, science, humanity, all people, the past, the future, animals, atoms, physical reality, and myself.

<p>
	All of your questions are too shallow and miss the point.
</p>

<p>
	Your skepticism is a red herring, a clever distraction from realizing that you are hallucinating. Every reason you have is just another part of the hallucination.

<p>
	No one can help you because all others are just your own hallucination, including myself.

<p>
	They are not the same spectrum at all.
</p>

<p>
	SD is a lot more modest and successful as a model. SD does not rank people in a simplistic fashion. It acknowledges that people are complex and occupy multiple colors across multiple lines.
</p>

<p>
	I notice that many of you here have not studied SD deeply. You have a very surface level understanding of it based purely on watching my videos, which is a problem.

	Ego, ego, ego. Survival, survival, survival. Duality, duality, duality.
</p>

<p>
	Being outraged by and righteous about a thing is survival and delusion.
</p>

<p>
	This work is about truth, not justifying attacks on parts of reality which threaten your survival.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you attack is none other than your self. Just because you hate something a lot doesn't change this fundamental fact.
</p>

<p>
	If you have been hurt in the past, that is understandable, but adding ego on top of the hurt creates a spiritual trap.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot overcome evil through hatred or judgment. Never, never, ever. Until you realize this, you will be stuck.
</p>

<p>
	The only solution to evil is Truth. And what you wrote above is not Truth.

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not just based on one man's reaearch, and it's a complex model that doesn't assign people numerical values for awakening, and like I always say, you need to understand that it's relative and has its limits.
</p>

<p>
	SD is much more robust than a linear numerical scale for nonduality.

<p>
	You do not know the degree of awakening of any human beings. Just keep that in mind. That is what is true for you. Anything else are beliefs you have picked up from hearsay or your own speculations.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea how awakened Ekhart Tolle is, or Ramaji is, or anyone. And even the notion that you could know is highly suspect.
</p>

<p>
	Assigning numbers to teachers is a dangerous game.
</p>

<p>
	It's extremely important that you admit to yourself that you don't really know these things. Otherwise you fall into a delusion of thinking you know something which you actually do not know.
</p>

<p>
	If Ramaji's mind is corrupt, then his scale could be corrupt and you have no way of knowing that. You cannot just assume that his scale is accurate. To assume such a thing would violate the whole thrust of our work here.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, Ramaji's numerical rating of me was immediately incorrect. He rated me too highly and wasn't aware he did so.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot trust anyone in this work. No one! Not Ramaji, not Buddha, not Christ, not me.
</p>

	No, it is based on Ramaji's experience, which is hearsay/belief to you.

<p>
	You guys need to be a lot more accurate about identifying when a thing is belief/hearsay vs direct experience.

<p>
	Awakenings do not come with numerical values attached. Lol. This is not even Ramaji's direct experience, it is something his mind is constructing.

		</p>

		<p>
			So, are there other places where I can go to meet new people or I should brake through my fears?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	You will ALWAYS have that fear. That fear is not going to go away no matter which location you go to.
</p>

<p>
	It takes 1000s of approaches to start to get fearless. Until then, expects lots of fear. Approach despite the fear.
</p>

<p>
	Bus, sidewalk, cafe, mall, store, school... it's all the same.
</p>

<p>
	If it looks wierd it's because your mind imagines it so, and also because you are doing it in an uncool/creepy way. When done well an approach is never creepy or weird, regardless of location.
</p>

<p>
	You can even aproach a kissing couple on a park bench and have fun flirting with his girl. It's all in how you do it.
</p>

<p>
	You can even approach while she is with her mother and father and flirt with the whole family! Again, this requires some serious skill, so don't start here.
</p>

<p>
	The best location to start is bars and clubs because you can get away with a lot less skill and there are 10x more opportunities so you can blow up interactions without worry. During the day time you need to be much more precise than at night. Day time presents much less opportunities so you gotta strike with precision and skill.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Normal and abnormal are purely relative.
</p>

<p>
	It's very possible that a baby might be born to an abusive mother who feeds him baby milk poisoned with lead so he will grow up with a brain full of lead which then causes him to become a murderer.
</p>

<p>
	This is all part of reality. In a vastly complex reality, all sorts of fringe cases happen.
</p>

<p>
	I have never said that everyone is saved in the way you imagine. A lot of people are born into fucked up survival situations which are totally "unfair" and "horrific".
</p>

<p>
	But all of this is still relative and does not diminish the absolute goodness and love of reality. Love entails freedom. And freedom entails horror. Love entails horror and "evil." So it all adds up in the finally tally. But any individual life can get totally fucked.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality does not promise anyone a good material life. Just the opposite, it guarantees that your material attachments will end in deep suffering. Which is the whole point of transcendence.
</p>

<p>
	No matter how good your life is, a day will come when you will be totally fucked. So transcend while you can.
</p>

<p>
	Tis a mistake to take such simplistic numeric scales seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening cannot be quantified or mapped on a linear scale.
</p>

<p>
	Furthermore, all of this is purely hearsay and goes against the core of this work, which is direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	You have no clue whether these scales are accurate. You are just taking someone's word for it, giving away your own authority.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out, this can easily become a deep epistemic trap which skews your whole worldview.

It is not a direct realization, so you're still speaking from a position of delusion.
</p>

<p>
	In this work it does not matter what you believe or think. What matters is direct awareness of what is the case.
</p>

<p>
	All others, including yourself, are imaginary. You're not appreciating how radical this is. You're intellectualizing it and treating it as a cool idea. That is not nearly good enough.

<p>
	By your logic, all presidents would have to be populists because otherwise they couldn't get elected.
</p>

<p>
	Yet most presidents have not been populists. So clearly non-populist candidates win often and populist candidates lose often.

</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice this is solved simply by over-satisfying your needs.
</p>

<p>
	So if you're needy with girls, go sleep with 10-20 girls and your neediness will drop significantly.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot just wish your neediness away.
</p>

<p>
	The process you go through to successfully sleep with 10-20 females will cure you of much neediness. But it will be challenging process. Don't expect it to be easy. You will fail a lot. And that's exactly what will beat the neediness out of you. Every girl you lose will teach you a valuable lesson. You will come face-to-face with the ugliness of your own neediness.

</p>

<p>
	Do the practices or do not. But do not speculate about metaphysical issues.
</p>

<p>
	All understanding about God must come from direct personal experience. All guesswork and speculation is wrong.

<p>
	Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of spirituality is to face what is true and face all of one's fears.
</p>

<p>
	Your father will never awaken so long as he fears seeing sinister astral beings.
</p>

<p>
	All fear is fear of one's own consciousness. And until this is full realized, one will never awaken.
</p>

<p>
	He should take psychedelics precisely because he fears them. What he really fears is himself.

<p>
	How on Earth can you reach such a conclusion from that set of facts?
</p>

<p>
	When you hear a phone call, you hear a phone call. That is it. It has no more meaning than that. The rest is your interpretation, imagination, and projection.
</p>

<p>
	"A phone call about a pizza means there must be a pizza somewhere and therefore an external reality" << This is your projection.
</p>

<p>
	What's real is PRECISELY what appears. If you don't see a pizza, it isn't. If you imagine there is a pizza, that's exactly what's true: you imagining a pizza. If you think there's an external reality, that's exactly what's true: you are thinking there's an external reality. But notice, thinking there is an external reality does not mean there is an external reality.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is exactly what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.
</p>
