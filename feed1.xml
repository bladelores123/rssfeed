</p>

<p>
	False = that which is not. Falsehood isn't. There is only Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Mind and ego are both conceptual constructions.
</p>

<p>
	Truth with a capital T has no opposite.

So spinning falsehood becomes the devil's #1 priority.

<title>Accepting evil</title>

<p>
	No experience lasts forever. They all end. The only thing that can last forever is Nothingness and it is not painful.
</p>

<p>
	So in the long run you can look forward to Nothingness <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> That is why enlightenment is the ultimate Good, and why God is ultimately Good.
</p>

<p>
	There is literally nothing to fear. All fear is illusion. You just need to become conscious enough to see this. And that can only happen with death (enlightenment).
</p>

<p>
	No ego, no problem.

<p>
	No, but your sufferring would stop, thereby elimating the problem.
</p>

<p>
	No self, no problem.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you cannot stop all murder, but you can become so conscious that if you were murdered, it would not bother you.

			Since god has to include everything, that is one of the dimensions/realitys.

<p>
	This happens everyday to millions of people in the world. Millions of peole suffer pain like you can not imagine.
</p>

<p>
	What then? You would suffer until you died. When sufferring gets severe enough it goes full circle into peace. With enough suffering the ego-mind will simply shut off and die, thereby ending the sufferring.
</p>

<p>
	Linear time is not infinite. All form, all experience will one day end.
</p>

<p>
	Death itself is total bliss. The act of dying, maybe not so much.

<p>
	Ego is an illusion. It is not infinite and nothing formed lasts forever.

<p>
	Ego cannot be immortal. Only the no-self is immortal, and it is bliss beyond anything you can imagine.

<title>Why Are Mainstream Scientists Afraid Of Fringe Ideas?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/27171-why-are-mainstream-scientists-afraid-of-fringe-ideas/?do=findComment&amp;comment=308992</link>

<p>
	The strength and weakness of science is that it's conservative. For science to be able to claim a monopoly on the "truth" is must create a boundary between itself and falsehood. Then this boundary must be maintained by upholding rigorous standards for "proof". This is its strength and weakness. It's precisely because science tries to be so rigorous that it ends up excluding all truths which science hasn't yet figured out how to rigorously prove.
</p>

<p>
	Proof is always a smaller subset of truth, as Kurt Godel proved! There are many thinga which are true which are impossible to prove. Like existence, for example! Try to prove that the world exists. You can't!
</p>

<p>
	This is basically the same problem as with anti-virus software. In trying so hard to defend your PC it ends up denying many legit software and websites from working.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that a poorly tuned anti-virus software ends up becoming the worst software on your PC.
</p>

<p>
	A prime example of how evil and deception happens in the name of good.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry about it because you will be dead by then.
</p>

<p>
	The Void Self will live through a trillion lives. But you are not going to know it because you are one of those lives now. You don't have enough elevation to see the full picture.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that you already died a bunch of times as Napoleon, Hitler, etc. You just don't have access to those memories in this incarnation. So it's no problem for you.
</p>

<p>
	The issue here is that who you think you are, are your memories. Those memories will get wiped. Those memories are not the ultimate you, they are the illusory you. Any fear you have is also part of the illusory you.

<p>
	Distinction is prior to thought.
</p>

<p>
	Thought IS one kind of distinction!
</p>

<p>
	Words cannot get at what distinction is. So even though I am using the word "distinction" here, which comes with the concept of a distinction, that concept is NOT what I am talking about! I mean ACTUAL distinction, not the concept of one.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the concept of a distinction is also a distinction, but it is only one out of many and not what we are ultimately pointing to when we ask "What is a distinction?"
</p>

<p>
	This is where things get very Zen.
</p>

<p>
	If you still think distinction is a thought or a concept, you aren't getting it yet.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is a distinction. Seperation does not exist. Just because two things are distinct does not mean they are seperate.
</p>

<p>
	Most of you guys here have no idea yet how profound distinction is. If you were fully conscious of what a distinction is, you would understand all of existence!

</p>

<p>
	It is worth your while to seriously contemplate "What is a distinction?" Take your time with this one. There's a lot more to it than meets the eye.

	Most medications have a very rare chance of serious side effects.
</p>

<p>
	Life is a risky game. If you except guarantees of safety you're in the wrong place.

<title>About to inherit half a million dollars</title>

<p>
	In other words, this money will solve nothing in your life.
</p>

<p>
	You still lack clarity about what you want and nothing will solve that except clarity about what you want.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I would not hinge my plans on this money unless you have the cash in your hands. Half a mil in a few years sounds very suspicious. When it comes to things like that, they usually never pan out.

<p>
	Modafinil is readily available to those who care to search.
</p>

<p>
	You can bite off a small crumb from the pill.
</p>

<p>
	I haven't heard of any fake modafinil pills. It's cheap and legit manufactured in India. It comes in factory foil packages.

Relative is a very accurate and good word.
</p>

<p>
	Relative is precisely what conventional understanding, science, and awareness is. Relative as in: Einstein's General Relativity. Relative as in: one thing is understood in relation or by contrast to another. In other words, dualistic understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, it's not absolute, but we mostly live and survive in the relative domain. So don't reject it too much.
</p>

<p>
	Relative and conceptual are not identical. The size of objects is relative for example.
</p>

<p>
	The metaphor of the image and the LCD screen comes in handy here. The image is both separate from the screen but also not other than the screen itself.
</p>

<p>
	The voice IS you, but not all of you. The voice is like one image on a screen.
</p>

<p>
	Perception is actually only possible because you ARE the things you perceive. Perception is BEING plus ego. Being is perception minus ego.

<p>
	Don't let evil boss you around. Love is more powerful. You can bank on that.

<p>
	Always take psychedelics on a totally empty stomach. At least 4 hours from your last meal. This is key.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just a matter of a longer come up. The food changes the quality of the trip. It weighs you down and takes blood away from your brain.
</p>

<p>
	You can eat some snacks a few hours into the trip, after the peak. Keep it light. Always have some healthy snacks ready the day before.
</p>

<p>
	AL-LAD gets really profound at 150ug and above. That was just a baby dose.
</p>

<p>
	This is where the distinction between relative and absolute truth becomes handy.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is not a belief, it is actuality (as pointed to in my What Is Actuality episode.) Absolute Truth is non-conceptual.
</p>

<p>
	Relative truth is conceptual. It's all the useful concepts you learn doing personal development and it explains how to practically navigate the world. For example, "don't eat bad food or you will feel bad." Spiral Dyanmics and all of science is relative truth. These relative truths are very important, but you want to hold them loosely and hear many perspectives so you don't get stuck.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth can only be accessed through direct mystical experience. You cannot learn it.
</p>

Your political views are still naive.
</p>

<p>
	No one who takes the likes of Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro, or David Rubin seriously can be taken seriously. These people are deluded and well-paid political hacks.
</p>

<p>
	Many democrats do not take PAC money, like Ocassio Cortez, Beto O'Rourke, and dozens of others.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives do not care about getting money out of politics or reforming the system because they they are capitalist ideologues.
</p>

<p>
	It is NOT a genuine sharing of good ideas. It is ego reaction done as a money grab.
</p>

<p>
	The IDW offers zero real governance solutions. It's just a bunch of grown men whining and getting paid for it.
</p>

<p>
	If you're not careful you will be bamboozled by these ideologies. I've warned you guys how many times about ideology?
</p>

<p>
	This ideology stuff is very subtle and widespread.
</p>

<p>
	On this topic especially is where you'd want to apply my Mankind Is Full Of Shit video. You need to learn to see through the bullshit. IDW is bullshit plain and simple.

</p>

<p>
	Don't turn governance into a culture war as the IDW is doing.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to pathological Orange is Green. IDW is just an egoic reaction against Green. It does not address and serious policy issues.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to remove all money from politics and stop the culture wars. But of course that will not happen without a lot of resistance and yelling. But that's always how progress happens: thru half the people kicking and screaming like children.

It just seems that armodafinil does not suit your brain type.
</p>

<p>
	You could try modafinil. It is a bit different than armodafinil so there is a chance it won't give you headaches.
</p>

<p>
	I find armodafinil a lot more powerful. So much so that I hesitate to use it most days. Modafinil is more mellow.

	He did many years of both. He was into Zen a lot and he was a serious meditator.
</p>

<p>
	In the end it's probably gonna be a combo of techniques that get you there. The path is rarely straight.

	Modafinil is def more powerful than coffee and I never get any withdrawal symptoms from it. It's very easy to stop for me.

<p>
	Hmmm... Sounds like the side effects are too strong for you.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I've never gotten a headache.
</p>

<p>
	If you get headaches, then I recommend not taking it any more. Try some of the other supplements.

<p>
	The key is: judgment has an emotional charge.
</p>

<p>
	That emotional charge is the problem. It betrays an egoic attachment & agenda.

<p>
	When you're starting out you gotta be humble. Setting your sighta so high that you are too good for lesser jobs can be the biggest load of egoic bullshit. You rarely start life with a cushy job. You gotta work your way up to it.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about you getting a good job, it's about how much value you bring ot the table. If you ain't bringing lots of value, don't expect a good job. And bringing lots of value requires expertise and skillz.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bit of a catch-22, but it is possible to build up your skillz on your own and develop a juicy portfolio of work on the basis of which you will entice an employer to hire you.
</p>

<p>
	I will reveal it at some point.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind that more powerful isn't necessarily better. Power could come with side effects and body load, and you could retain less insight than with a less powerful substance.
</p>

<p>
	I've had trips so nondual that little got retained because there's just nothing there but an infinite void.

<p>
	When I take my stack, it is certainly no mere placedo. It's VERY noticable. Modafinil is especially very noticable.
</p>

<p>
	Armodafinil is nuts for me.
</p>

<p>
	And sulbutiamine seems to be the second most noticable for me.
</p>

<p>
	It can be hard to notice each supplement in isolation but easier when they are stacked and synergize.

<p>
	Join Toastmasters and/or practice talking out loud to yourself in the car, at home, in the shower.
</p>

<p>
	Also, talking to a camera really helps. Just set up your smart phone on a tripod, hit record, and talk. Do this every day and you will improve rapidly.
</p>

<p>
	Talk about whatever you are most passionate about and have lots of experience with. For example, if you love techno music, talk about that.
</p>

<p>
	There are deeper levels and more facets.
</p>

<p>
	Don't stop prematurely.
</p>

<p>
	Depression is an egoic reaction. It's normal and to be expected. But go beyond it. Go deeper.

<p>
	Of course don't ONLY do that exercise for the rest of your life, but you could doing it for a couple months and then switch it up.

<p>
	You gotta experiment to see which exercises jive with you.

<p>
	That's just ego backlash/resistance.
</p>

<p>
	If you're doing a lot of personal dev then you should expect to feel WORSE not better. This is like lifting heavy weights at the gym. Muscle soreness is not bad, it's sorta the point.
</p>

<p>
	Big change is emotionally taxing.
</p>

<p>
	You must learn to console yourself in times of stress and upheaval.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't be spending all day doing personal dev. Schedule some time for R&R and fun. Your schedule needs to be sustainable in the long run.

<p>
	Your two groups are a rather arbitrary dichotomy. The self-help industrry is gigantic and draws in all sorts, young to old, suffering to ambitious, depressed to happy, losers to successful.
</p>

<p>
	There's not a single person wouldn't benefit from some form of self help. Your entry point will vary: a bad relationship, desire for more money, desire to calm your emotions, desire to be more confident, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Hell, you could study this stuff purely for intellectual curiosity, as I like to do.

<title>Life Purpose or Girls?</title>

Plan things out strategically.
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose is a very long-term project. It will take you at least 5 years to seriously actualize it. So while you're chipping away at that, you should of course also work on other areas of your life like developing dating skills.
</p>

<p>
	You can work on your life purpose most of the week, but then Friday & Saturday nights you can focus on dating. This will actually rejuvenate you for next week's work.
</p>

<p>
	Counter-intuitively you can sometimes accomplish more work when you have good outlets for rejuvenation & socialization.

</p>

<p>
	There are times in your life when you will need to focus on your LP 100% to the exclusion of everything else. But then there are times when that's not efficient, where you don't have that much work to do on your LP, which frees up time for other things. And sometimes you will need to put your LP on the backburner for a while (into maintenance mode) while you work on your relationships, family, house, health, etc.
</p>

<p>
	At your current stage in life you probably don't need to be spending 8 hours a day on your LP.

	As soon as you try to articulate or conceptualize it, it slips through your fingers.

<p>
	This is what makes enlightenment work so tricky. You have to be able to grok that which cannot be grokked. I call this hyper-intuition. You start to understand reality transcendentally, non-symbolically.

</p>

<p>
	Zero sound is pure empty consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Zero sight is pure empty consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Zero feel is pure empty consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	To become aware of this Groundless Ground is enlightenment. It's remarkable when you realize that ALL sensation have always occurred within the Groundless Ground. It will be so obvious that you won't understand why you never "saw" this Nothingness before. It was there the whole time! It is you! It is God!
</p>

<p>
	Look closely at your actual hand. That is Nothingness!
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness is NOT an idea. Nothingness is actuality itself.

<p>
	Yes, that is the catch-22 of social development: low consciousness crowds tend to elect low consciousness leaders, and low consciousness leaders tend to empower low consciousness crowds.
</p>

<p>
	The entire society must therefore go through the struggle of fighting it out. The fighting it out IS the ACTUAL process of growth & evolution. Growth and evolution are sometimes bloody and ugly. Peace leads to war, and war leads to peace, and on and on it goes. That's the duality inherent within nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Every country, and every human being is going through this struggle to various degrees. It's just since Brazil isn't as mature as America or Europe, its growing pains will be more acute.

	Just to be safe, you can cut a blotter square into 4ths and consume one fourth just to test it. That should be about 20-30ug, which is a very mild dose. You won't trip balls on that amount, but you'll def feel it.
</p>

<p>
	After that test run, you can have much more confidence consuming a full square.

<p>
	Thing is, you can't just upgrade an entire nation by electing one good guy. That never works. What's necessary is to upgrade the systems, the infrastructure, the culture, the average people.
</p>

<p>
	Low consciousness people cannot appreciate a high consciousness leader (if Lula can even be called that -- I can't speak to what crimes is did or did not commit).
</p>

<p>
	Brazil is very Blue still and it will take a lot of work to transition it to pure Orange, let alone Green. Even America is failing to embrace Green. Brazil will not be Green in our lifetimes. But Orange is possible.

			Really? You would be ok with someone to be with you because of shallow reasons?

<p>
	It's not shallow reasons. Being successful opens a lot of doors. Then love comes. It's not like the girls falls in love with your money. You can lure her in with your success, but then make her fall in love with your personality.
</p>

<p>
	Most girls are not the golddigger types. A few are, but most aren't. If you're intelligent you can use this to your advantage. Become successful, access the hottest girls, and then pick one and make her fall in love with you rather than your money or success.
</p>

<p>
	The best thing about success is that it can buy you access to lots of people, which then gets you a lot of eyeballs, which makes attracting females a lot easier than being just another guy at the club.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, there are pros and cons to each personality style and mating strategy. Nerds have ways of getting laid. Jocks have ways of getting laid. Etc. The only people who don't get laid are those who sit at home complaining on online forums.
</p>

<p>
	There is just 1 tricking to finding girls: GO OUT & BE SOCIAL! That's it! Everything else is minutia.
</p>

<p>
	I don't care who you are or what you look like, if you go out long enough you will attract a girl.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but you will need to go at it much harder in the end to breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	But for starting, that is okay. You gotta start slow.
</p>

<p>
	In the end you will need to go at it 100 hours in a row.

</p>

<p>
	Focus on yoga, meditation, self-inquiry, shamanic breathing, etc. And read a lot about nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are no joke. They will rip your reality apart.

			That sounds a bit harsh to me. Hinduism is not about believing something, but about seeking. So non-duality is in essence something that has to be questioned and discussed over and over again, like the Indians did.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, this a common misunderstanding.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing to discuss about nonduality. Nonduality is perfectly clear and perfectly documented.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing to do with nonduality is to practice it. Anything else is the ego distracting from the work.
</p>

<p>
	Debating God does not help anyone. It's perfectly clear what God is. The only question is: will you do the practices necessary to realize it?
</p>

<p>
	That you are God is not up for debate or discussion. Look and you will see that it's true. Of course most egos don't want to look. Which is why they resort to all kinds of devilry instead.
</p>

<p>
	This is why Zen practice is very austere and brutal. There is no room in Zen for debate. A Zen master would never allow debate in his zendo. Smartasses who try to debate a Zen master will get a punch in the face.
</p>

<p>
	The proof is in the practice and nowhere else. If you want to ask questions about how to improve your practice, that is welcome and good. Stick to that. I love reading and answering those types of questions.
</p>

<p>
	But starting threads about how Leo is full of shit, or how enlightenment is fake, or how you are not God -- that's just bullshit.
</p>
