<p>
	This is just a belief. No different than when a Christian believes that the Earth is 5000 years old.
</p>

<p>
	Question all your assumptions. Where did you get this belief about brains and sense organs and biological creatures? Notice that all of it is hearsay from other people. You do not find any of this in direct experience.

<p>
	What more do you want? Do those things more rigorously rather that looking for new stuff to do.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you went to the best buffet in town, surrounded by food, and you log onto a food forum and ask the people there, "Guys, I'm at this buffet, but tell me how to increase my chances of finding more food."
</p>

<p>
	This work is not about more flashy stuff, it's about going deeper with the basics.

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is not a quality, it is all qualities and their negation simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity & God are not concepts. Of course they are concepts, but those concepts point to something prior to concept. In the same way that Australia is a concept BUT there is also the actual land which the word "Australia" points to.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, concepts themselves are part of Infinity, otherwise they could to occur.

			The only pragmatists who deny sufism came up in 17th century, and took over Arabia with the fall of caliphate and Ottoman empire in 1924.They are called the Wahabbis/Salafis, who are literalists. They are so stupid that they oppose majority of Muslims and say God is separate from humans and lives on heavens.
		</p>

		<p>
			All Sufi orders have spiritual chains of masters which lead to Prophet Muhammad(pbuh).There cannot be a sufi order without a spiritual chain, and the chain connects from different masters to either Ali or Abu Bakr which further connects with Prophet Muhammad.

<p>
	Because you aren't aware that you are me.
</p>

<p>
	You are implicitly assuming that there is a you and a me (these two beings). But there isn't. And you don't understand that yet. You acknowledge the possibility that you and I are one, but you are only doing this at the level of concept. You aren't doing it actually. If you did it actually you would experience a death of yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment at the level of concept is not enlightenment, it is theory. You must go from theory to actuality.
</p>

<p>
	Come to a point where there is actually no difference between me and you. Not in theory, but ACTUALLY!
</p>

<p>
	This requires a change in your state of consciousness. You cannot do it through thinking.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I wouldn't think of kundalini complications as being dark. It's just various sorts of energetic unlocking & processing.
</p>

<p>
	An energetic block doesn't have to be dark to be uncomfortable, frustrating, or troubling.
</p>

<p>
	So you can practice being loving, but an energetic upheaval can still get ya.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, for some people there might be a dark aspect to kundalini. There's a lot of variety to how these things can unfold. Some people report experiencing demons and other weird stuff. Personally that's foreign to my experiences but I think it's possible for some.
</p>

<p>
	I've never had a demonic experience in 70+ trips. I'm not sure what causes it. I guess demons don't like me <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />

<p>
	This is false. You can have direct experience of and genuine insight into the nature of death, afterlife, and pre-life.
</p>

<p>
	Of course people concoct all sorts of theories, but there are also some people who actually know through direct experience and mystical insight.

	Notice that people who hold these ideologies have almost no historical understanding of how government works, nor do they have any understanding of human psychology.
</p>

<p>
	It's simply ignorance, naivete, and arrogance rolled into one.
</p>

<p>
	You'll notice that no country in the history of the Earth has ever been libertarian or anarchist. Because it doesn't work to meet the needs of the people, so it would never be tolerated. You'd have to be a fool to even begin implementing it because you would quickly be kicked out or killed.
</p>

<p>
	Try to imagine a libertarian or anarchist going to Russia or China and promoting their agenda. LOL

<p>
	You have to appreciate that since the devil has co-opted your mind, what you find desirable is precisely the opposite of Paradise. Why are you so gullible as to trust your desires? Haven't you realized yet that desire is how the devil manipulates you?

<p>
	Your mistake is sitting there thinking about all this with your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Instead, you must do the practices.
</p>

<p>
	All your rationalizing is just a waste of time. You will never figure it out that way.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get somewhere, go do psychedelics, or Kriya yoga, or mindfulness meditation. Do it seriously and rigorously, like it's the most important pursuit in your life, more important than money, sex, entertainment, or comfort.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot understand the things I teach without doing serious practices. It's just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	Do, or do not. Speculation and theorizing will get you nowhere.
</p>

<p>
	Common sense should tell you that there must be a heavy, heavy cost to awakening, otherwise everyone would be awake.

<p>
	Self/other is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	You are imagining all beings, including yourself. Living beings have no reality whatsoever. This includes you.
</p>

<p>
	When this is realized, you will be totally alone in the universe. No one can help you, no one can tell you whether you've gone insane. No one can comfort you. Other than yourself.
</p>

<p>
	At this point the notion of reality entirely collapses. You are no long able to distinguish what is real or unreal because there is no difference. Your entire life collapses into oblivion and you find yourself dead yet still somehow conscious.

<p>
	It's a powerful kundalini activator for some people. The energy it activates can get stuck in various ways and lead to all sorts of spiritual emergencies. Not to mention that any kind of technique which rapidly builds up mindfulness and elevates consciousness can cause people to freak out. The ego-mind tends to resist such efforts in many different kinds of sneaky ways. It can trigger sleepless, anxiety, anger, restlessness, tension, cravings, visions, hallucinations, paranormal phenomena, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You should read up on the dangers of activating kundalini before you start yoga. I have some books on my book list about it. You don't want to be caught unawares.
</p>

<p>
	Basically all the stuff I talked about in my The Dark Side Of Meditation video, but even worse.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear, it's not guaranteed that bad stuff will happen. It's just a possibility.
</p>

<p>
	It also depends on how deep you go with it. If it takes you all the way to enlightenment you can certainly expect all the freakiness that comes with awakening, including the Dark Night of The Soul. Awakening is not all rainbows and daffodils. Some egos have serious freak outs.

<p>
	Rumi was a one in a billion enlightened master. And he started his own sect: Sufism, which most mainstream Muslims reject.

<p>
	You guys really need to educate yourself about social history.
</p>

<p>
	You can't seriously discuss political issues without understanding the historical context.

	Evangelicals support Trump because he panders to all of their stage Blue values, including nationalism, anti-LGBTQ, anti-minority rights, anti-abortion, and anti-secularism.

Again, you need to educate yourself on women's reproductive issues.
</p>

<p>
	Banning abortion is a terrible idea as you will create black markets and all sorts of health complications for a medical procedure which needed for many women. Not even to mention the human rights violations.
</p>

<p>
	Trump banning abortions is NOT a silver lining. It is a massive regressive step for society.

<p>
	Don't project your worldview and values onto others. Most people don't give a damn and would love to see the endangered species list nixed just to stick it to liberals. Or to be more accurate, most people are so clueless they have no idea any of this is even happening.

	Going vegan sounds good in theory, but in practice not enough people will do it.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that massive systemic problems require solutions that SCALE across tens of millions of people. 10s of millions of people are not going vegan any time soon.
</p>

<p>
	Reform of the political system is necessary. The #1 step is removing all money from politics.
</p>

<p>
	If you really care, donate or volunteer to: Wolf-Pac.com to help them pass a Constitutional Amendment to get money out of politics. And vote in primaries for the most progressive leaders. Primary all centrist corporatist Democrats. There will not be change so long as corporatists are in power. This means corporatist Democrats and all Republicans. Kick them out.

	Environmental problems are chiefly systemic. They cannot be solved at the individual level, they must be solved at the collective level.
</p>

<p>
	You can recycle all the Coke cans you want, but it will not make a dent in the problem.
</p>

<p>
	Environmental problems require a stage Yellow systemic perspective. So your energy would be better used not in recycling Coke cans but getting politically active. Voting in your local primaries and donating to conscious politicians and telling your friend to vote too is more important than recycling Coke cans.
</p>

<p>
	To solve most of our serious problems all that's needed is serious political engagement. Elect the right people and they will solve the problems for you.

	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Notice that stage Blue -- because it is very conformist -- is extremely easy to fool and manipulate by a stage Red/Orange opportunist like Trump. A stage Blue person has no problem buying the idea that Trump is "a man of God".
</p>

<p>
	Also notice how TYT (stage Green) struggles to understand stage Blue. It baffles TYT how stage Blue people can exist. They're constantly surprised by the foolishness of Blue.
</p>

<p>
	A classic example of the Blue vs Green understanding gap.

	It would be highly systemic in its thinking and it would be working to solve serious world problems, not building iPhone apps.
</p>

<p>
	Think of software that could help move other people up the Spiral somehow.
</p>

<p>
	And also your company would need to have stage Yellow leadership style and organizational style.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to do some serious research to build that. Don't expect such a job to fall in your lap. You have to invent it and lead it.

They are trying to unify a nation. They can't do that if everyone goes their own way. Blue is nationalism, which is what China's up to. They want to build a cohesive national Chinese identity. Of course this doesn't just happen willingly. People resist and China cracks down.
</p>

<p>
	Not saying China is the good guy here, but understand why they do what they do. They do it out of love.

<p>
	China is more Blue than Red I'd say. Hong Kong is more Orange.
</p>

<p>
	It's gonna be tricky for HK because China will not let them be independent as they used to be under British rule.

<p>
	Not-knowing does not exclude foul play.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it is very fishy and should be investigated. But I see people jumping way too eagerly towards conspiracy theories, which is a recipe for epistemic blunder.
</p>

<p>
	Best to admit "I don't know" and conduct an investigation. Of course an investigation is necessary. Pretty much everyone agrees on that.

<p>
	Because society has built up a bureaucratic infrastructure through 10,000 years of bloodshed, rape, genocide, theft, torture, and other horrors that you cannot even being to imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks to that infrastructure (which we call government) you enjoy the life you do while being totally oblivious as to how all this works or where it came from.

<p>
	This is a good case to admit the truth: You don't know.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how the mind spins theories and stories to convince itself. But the fact is extremely clear: you just don't know.
</p>

<p>
	Notice this. This is a very important point.

<p>
	Yes, all this is normal and great stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual purification I call it. The body stores a lot of emotional baggage, fear, tension, ego, etc. You're gonna have to release all that shit to reach the highest levels of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	The good news is, your next trip should take you much deeper into existential insight. The point of releasing personal baggage is to make yourself pure enough to realize the deepest existential insights.
</p>

<p>
	Next time try contemplating a question like: What is Love? What is God? Why does reality exist? What is intelligence? What is perception? What is consciousness? What is evil? and so forth.
</p>

<p>
	Once you purge all the energetic blocks, that's when the trips become really interesting. You can sit calmly and just contemplate.

	You must actively seek it, otherwise the whole world would be awake, and hardly anyone is.

<p>
	Some very spiritually advanced folks have spontaneous awakenings. But this is extremely rare for the most and not something you can rely on.

<p>
	That is a pretty absurd question. Of course the company must make profit off you, otherwise they'd be out of business.
</p>

<p>
	Business is not so simply. A company does not always know how much it's going to make off you because companies take risks. In some cases a company could actually lose money on you.
</p>

<p>
	If you ask that question on an interview, you will never get hired because it's way too combative and entitled, and doesn't appreciate the complexities of business.

			Understand that self enquiry is an advanced meditation technique. Success is very slim and requires luck - momentary attunement in a beginner meditator.
		</p>

		<p>
			It only becomes powerful for adept meditators who have high degrees of stable attention, awareness and equanimity. In other words, meditators who've mastered the path of mindfulness.

<p>
	Through lots of trail and error I have found this to be true.
</p>

<p>
	It does not make sense to recommend self-inquiry to people who are stuck in monkey mind. They can spin their wheels for years without getting anywhere.
</p>

<p>
	Mindfulness training or Kriya Yoga is great for calming that monkey mind.

<p>
	Just be aware, taking medications to halt the spiritual purification process is like pressing the gas and the breaks in your car at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	Ideally you let the process unfold naturally without trying to escape from it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it can be very difficult at times. The more growth you try to accomplish is the least time, the more shocking it is to the system. So there's a trade-off here. You can spend a decade waking up or a week. If you do it in a week, it will probably be hell.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing to understand is that in the waking up process, serious emotional and energetic upheaval is quite common and normal. It is not a "bad" thing. Ideally you push through it. But if you feel like it's reaching a life-threatening level, then obviously find some way to back off and come back to it later.
</p>

<p>
	Also be ware of ego backlash. It's coming.
</p>

<title>Is Jordan Peterson having a middle life crisis?</title>

<p>
	In the end, you gotta understand that what JP is doing, he's doing out of love. A twisted version of love.
</p>

<p>
	But you should also keep in mind that what Trump is doing and what Hitler did was also done out of love.
</p>

<p>
	So just because someone is doing something out of love does not mean it will turn out well for you or even for himself.
</p>

<p>
	The one who suffers the most from JP's ideology is himself. He is clearly not a happy man.

<p>
	Trump has approved the Pebble Mine in Alaska, which will destroy the world's largest salmon fishery:

<p>
	The day Trump won the election the first think I thought was: this is going to kill the environment.

			It seems to me like there is a lack of healthy blue due to the radical cultural changes that took place in the last few decades. A lot of people who listen to Jordan Peterson do not have their life sorted out at all, they do not have discipline, they do not take responsibility, they do not have purpose, they do not have meaning, which are all aspects which should be be communicated by stage blue institutions.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is certainly true. Many young people today lack discipline and other healthy aspects of Blue.
</p>

<p>
	The challenge is teaching Blue without indoctrinating people into a nationalist, anti-Green rabbit hole a la Fox News.

			Tell me some really high quality, amazing stage blue examples that teach this stuff on a wider cultural level. Whether you like the church or not, it definitely contributed to taking people through stage blue. In fact, I often observe people who never were religious to be quite dysfunctional, hedonistic, miserable stage orange people. To me it is likely that it is due to a lack of a strong and good stage blue foundation.

<p>
	Yes, churches and schools are probably the best examples.
</p>

<p>
	I think African American churches are some of the best examples of healthy stage Blue.

<p>
	Military also teaches Blue well (when it's not doing war crimes).

<p>
	Yes, and it also leads to demonization of all higher stages. There is a cottage industry on YT for demonizing Green. Folks make careers out of it. One such folk is JP.

</p>

<p>
	The question is, how much turd are you willing to tolerate in your sandwhich before you say, "Okay, this here is a turd sandwhich. Why do I keep eating this? Is there nothing better to eat?"
</p>

<p>
	Fox News is also capable of making valid points sometimes. But is it really something that Americans should watch??

<p>
	No, I'm not implying anything per se. I'm just assessing Trump's mind. He has the type of mind that will take down the ship with it if it goes down.
</p>

<p>
	I don't foresee a nuclear holocaust. But some phony war is within the realm of possibility.
</p>

<p>
	And more importantly he is going to wage a battle domestically this coming election cycle. It's gonna get nastier and dirtier than ever as his chances of reelection shrink. He will rally and whip up his base into an ideological frenzy. There will be even more conspiracy theories, demonization of decent people, and probably some degree of violence as things get desperate for Trump's base and they start to lash out.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to understand about Trump's base is that they're all-in. They will never admit defeat or any wrong-doing -- because it will be too ugly for them to admit. So they will double-down and scapegoat someone else -- like immigrants, Muslims, socialists, women, or whoever. As the failures of the Trump admin keep getting worse, the scapegoating will keep getting worse.
</p>

<p>
	The Trump phenomenon is like a giant swollen pimple that needs to burst. How bad it gets is hard to say. We have to be careful, but also don't get overly pessimistic. This is all part of the nation's growth process. It is all necessary to evolve to the next level. Just be careful not to get caught up in the eruption.

			I have serious panic disorder based on hypochondria and the fear of death. My plan for ultimately getting off them is firstly in depth psychoanalysis and simultaneously doing consciousness work, meditation, self inquiry and yoga in order to ultimately reach enlightenment, go through the experience of being absolute infinity, realize I'm not the same as this body so I don't have to obsess over defending its existence.
		</p>

		<p>
			Edit: My pursuit of enlightenment though is different, it starts from curiosity more than a need to heal. Honestly ssri's are doing a wonderful job at the moment with zero to little side effects and I am back to an almost fully functional state, so in a sense they solve the problem. I could go on SSRI's and never have another panic attack. I want to pursuit the truth, being healed from my trauma is for me something a little more secondary.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	So what this tells me is you got A LOT of work to do before anything like enlightenment will dawn. Probably years of work.
</p>

<p>
	That's okay, but what I mean is, you don't have to worry too much about enlightenment right now. Focus building up your meditation skills, psychoanalysis, yoga, etc. All of that will build up your foundation. At some point you should begin to slowly ween yourself off the medication and pursue the Truth full-bore.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is about facing your own death. So you need to build yourself up to the point where you're not having panic attacks and you a ready to face ego dissolution. You are not going to be able to avoid facing death. That is the whole aim of enlightenment work. Enlightenment is all about facing your deepest fears and seeing through them with extraordinary levels of consciousness and concentration.
</p>

<p>
	Weening yourself off SSRI's will also allow you to play around with psychedelics -- which are one of the most effective tools for facing death and fear.

What are you trying to understand or get?
</p>

<p>
	Sits are usually not nearly as effective without a clear intention. It's very important to become clear about what you want out of this work. And there are many things you could be working on / developing / realizing.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to just sit and done nothing, without any objective or goal. Fine. But then make that your intention and be clear about it: "I will just sit here like a cat and be in the present moment."
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes that's effective.
</p>

<p>
	Other times it's more effective to have some existential question you're working on, like "What am I?" or "What is reality?" or "What is Love?" or "What is Truth?", etc.
</p>

<p>
	But understand this: there is way more to this work than merely sitting like a cat. Nothing wrong with sitting like a cat. But if you really want to understand reality, life, and self -- that won't be enough. You need to probe various aspects of life to crack its secrets.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could be working on building concentration skill.

<p>
	All good questions that only you can answer by going on the Hero's Journey and seeking Truth.
</p>

<p>
	All I'll tell you is, it's worth it.
</p>

<p>
	I could tell you it's all for Love, but you would not understand because you have not completed your Journey yet.

I feel all those topics are relevant to that end. You never know when some seemingly unimportant topic might be just the missing  piece you needed.

<p>
	But it's hard to please everyone. There are pros and cons going narrow or broad.

<p>
	My bias is to err on the side of comprehensiveness.

<title>Amazing Scaramucci Realization</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/38206-amazing-scaramucci-realization/?do=findComment&amp;comment=479094</link>

<p>
	I was amazed by this interview because in it Scaramucci (a stage Blue/Orange Wall Street guy) finally realizes Trump's stage Red nature. And finally he turns on Trump.
</p>

<p>
	The key moment happens right at the 0:30 mark. He realizes that Trump is not evolved enough to be genuinely racist because he's too much of a stage Red opportunist.
</p>

<p>
	It's the most amazing back-handed compliment I've ever heard, LOL:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqAhFqah2Pw?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	A great lesson in psychology and Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	It's also very revealing that Scaramucci saw Trump's opportunism in the flesh, but it never bothered him until now. Which is exactly right. Stage Orange itself tends to be opportunistic without much remorse or foresight of the problems that such unchecked opportunism leads to.
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem with putting a shameless opportunist into office is that he won't hesitate to start a war if it helps him get reelected. The more cornered such a person becomes, the more dangerous he becomes because his only concern is his own survival.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump goes down, he will take the entire ship with him.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Every stage has healthy & unhealthy aspects.
</p>

<p>
	What are the unhealthy aspects of Green?
</p>

<p>
	Sit down by yourself and list all of them out. Then compare to Green news sources like TYT. You will see a nice match if you do the exercise properly.
</p>

<p>
	But you're gonna have to step outside your own personal opinions and biases to do this exercise correctly.

<p>
	That only holds true for Green IF the other side is tolerant and non-oppressive.
</p>

<p>
	Green does not tolerate oppressive versions of stage Blue or Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Green will often viciously demonize capitalism or Wall Street, for example. Green can even be violent against oppression, as in the case of eco-terrorism, PETA, GreenPeace, and Antifa.
</p>

<p>
	Please educate yourself.

<p>
	No. That is incorrect. You need to study the Spiral Dynamics theory more. Go read the SD book or the works of Ken Wilber.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber wrote an entire book about the "Mean Green Meme". Green precisely demonizes Orange and lower stages.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, you misunderstand Green.
</p>

<p>
	Green is precisely tribalistic against oppressors. Green does not embrace those who are intolerant, like racists or authoritarians. Which is why Green dislikes Trump so much. They cannot stomach his bullying of people and his divisiveness.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a collectivist stage which comes with some group-think and dogmas. This doesn't make it Blue. Green dogma is quite different from Blue dogma. Overall, Green is much better at dealing with multiculturalism. Green is not nationalist or racist. Blue is.
</p>

<p>
	Green is not so evolved that it will be understanding of racism. That requires Yellow and above.

<p>
	Actually, that's part of Green. Green sees Blue & Orange as evil sometimes.
</p>

<p>
	To stop seeing Blue & Orange as evil requires Tier 2 Yellow perspective, which of course Green lacks.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, Trump supporters are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Have you watched some videos of Trump rallies? Of Trump supporters being interviewed? It's beyond deplorable:

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not enough to resonate with Blue or Orange. One has to transcend them.
</p>

<p>
	I can make YT videos that resonate with stage Blue and feed their worst racist impulses, leading them towards Nazism.
</p>

<p>
	I can make YT videos that resonate with stage Orange Wall Street types and help them to further exploit society and 3rd world countries with sweatshops.
</p>

<p>
	Fearmongering (as JP like to do) is not an effective way to lead people up the Spiral. How can you elevate stag Blue & Orange people to the next stage -- Green -- when you fearmonger about feminists, post-modernists, relativism, LGBTQ, environmentalists, hippies, Marxists, socialists, and communists??? That sends a message to stage Blue & Orange: "Don't bother going Green. Green is delusional and dangerous. Stay Blue & Orange."
</p>

<p>
	Conscious leaderships requires pointing out the limitations and dysfunctions <u>of the current stage</u>, not the future stage. For JP to lead people out of Blue & Orange he would have to be talking about the limitations and problems of Blue & Orange. Instead he talks about the limits of Green. Talking about the limits of Green is only helpful if you and your audience is at least Green.
</p>

<p>
	JP denies the seriousness of climate change. That alone tells you the danger of his ideology.
</p>
