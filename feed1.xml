<p>
	I am not attacking you.
</p>

<p>
	I just notice you keep getting caught up in these reactive patterns. That's something to outgrow, if you want. It must be painful. Why not put an end to it? You don't want to live life defending yourself. You want to be creative instead.

My experiences of God/Absolute are not like that at all.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe lay off the weed? It might be adding to your paranoia.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you might be having a kundalini awakening/activation. That would explain the body shaking and so forth. It might help you do some kind of body work to ground yourself or shake out the energy. Maybe Osho's dynamic meditation or just shaking your whole body like a madman. Chanting can also be helpful. When overwhelming energy comes up for you, try chanting AUM very long and deep from your belly, over and over again while also pounding your chest like a drum. Get a nice rythym going.
</p>

<p>
	I think you are doing okay. You just want to listen more to your body and let natural feelings show you the way. Trust your feelings. Let this process unfold and massage you. Sounds to me like God is taking over your mind and body. This is great. Let it take you over and rewire you. Surrender to it in high faith. Surrender to the highest love and truth. Set that intention every day. The ultimate goal is to let God take over your body. This requires a collapse of the old ego-mind. So that you become like a superconductor for God.
</p>

<p>
	This is exciting stuff! You've broken through to some deep awakening. Looks like you hooked a whale. Now slowly reel it in. Be patient with it. Really listen to your intution and highest feelings, not your rational mind. Allow your body to do whatever it wants to do (without hurting yourself).
</p>

<p>
	Prayer can be very helpful here. Prayer here would be you setting your intention to let God take over you for the highest good. Visualize what you want! This should help you cut through negative thinking and fear. Use your heart too! It's a powerful tool you can activate at any moment with feelings of love. Use that to cut through fear and doubt.
</p>

<p>
	Get clear about what you want in all of this. What is your intention? Do you want to be God? Do you want to surrender? Do you want the highest awakening? Intention is paramount here. Otherwise you are like a leaf blowing in the wind. Take control of the process, not from your mind but from your heart and soul. What does your soul want here?
</p>

	Indeed. You are too comfortable and complacent. Which is exactly why suffering exists. It's the only way a fool learns to wake up <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that your life can turn sour any second. Your health is not going to last. People around you will die. Etc. This is basically all guaranteed. You just ignore it to live your comfy life. It will not last. Not a chance. Life can turn really sour towards the end. What are you doing to prepare?
</p>

<p>
	People don't realize how "bad" life can get until its too late and they're stuck. The wise person prepares.
</p>

<p>
	But the biggest tragedy is simply what you miss out on by not living from an inspired place. You don't realize yet just how great you can be, just how good life can be.

<p>
	How many lifetimes of hell do you want to live through?
</p>

<p>
	Your soul desires to reunite with God. That's basically all it desires and it will not give you rest. Because it knows everything else is hogwash compared to God-realization.

<p>
	No, not always and never as deeply as during a trip. I'm sorta semi-lucid about it. Sometimes throughout the day I will reconnect and notice something like, "I am all alone" or "Hey! I'm God!"
</p>

<p>
	If I'm just going about everyday business it stays deep in the back of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	It's very much like sunlight through a cloudy sky. Occassional rays burst forth. The more you practice, the more you trip, the more rays burst forth on a regular basis.

<p>
	There may be very radical posibilities of incarnation. For example, imagine incarnating as a demi-god being who can architect his entire own universe of lesser beings and look after them like an ant farm. Imagine if you could split your consciousness into a million lesser beings and play through all of them at once.

	Just a crazy idea <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	It stops when you reach total oneness in all possible ways. Total God. And then you being again from the bottom.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take any of this on faith. It could be wrong as far as you know. I'm just throwing out some ideas to open your mind. Direct experience is king.

	I told you guys long ago that if you don't grow with me I will lose you in the dust. You can only see one or two stages ahead of you.
</p>

<p>
	By the time my work is done I will be seen as a madman and criminal. Then after I die I will be worshipped.
</p>

<p>
	Such is how humans behave.

<p>
	I'm saying those people who agree with my teachings the most are devils.

<p>
	It's like with the most zealous Christians. They are not true Christians, they are Christians in name only, not in action.

<p>
	You can only expect so much from a celeb gossip show.
</p>

<p>
	True happiness is a very radical and counterintuitive thing. Most people are not interested in it.
</p>

<p>
	If either of those men understood what true happiness is, their careers would be over. So it's not in their interest to understand it.

<p>
	Guys, it's not complicated. The instructions are clearly laid out in the books. All you have to do it follow them and practice. Everything will fall into place with a bit of practice. When in doubt, re-read that part of the book.
</p>

<p>
	You should not be here asking how to find a chakra. It's clearly explained in the books. If you can't follow that instruction how will a forum post help you?

</p>

<p>
	A soul is an individuated unit of cosmic consciousness which holds data even if you as the body/mind disappear.
</p>

<p>
	All souls are still ultimately one so this doesn't contradict nonduality. It just means there are layers to reality you are not aware of yet.
</p>

<p>
	Don't hold your body as primary. Soul is primary, body is just a costume it wears.
</p>

<p>
	Think of yourself as a hydra creature. Each head is one lifetime. Any head can be lost and the creature still lives on.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really say anything new. Most of these things have been written in various arcane scriptures which no one bothers to read for over 5000 years.
</p>

<p>
	If you care to understand reality in its fullest there is no getting around reading at least 200 books. You're not really serious otherwise. Your curiosity is too weak. If you really cared, reading 200 books would be a small price to pay to understand the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, most people will never do it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the next best thing. But most people won't do that properly either.
</p>

<p>
	The reason is: you don't really want to know the truth. It's not comfortable or easy.

<p>
	You will do it gladly. With love. Don't think of it as being the same stuck on a loop. You can make new choices each incarnation. It's like playing a video game. Each playthrough is different. Life's not a movie, it's a video game!

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1329-shiva/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="1329" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1329-shiva/" rel="">@Shiva</a> Firstly, yes it is strange-loopy since everything is one and you are talking about yourself here. The self-reference problem cannot be avoided here.
</p>

<p>
	But also consider:
</p>

<p>
	God's will is to give you free will. So you are free to be a creator. God watches as you create just to see what you as human will create. God loves anything you create equally much. But at the same time God desires that you re-discover the highest joy in existence: the joy of being God! So it's a though God had a trillion children in order to give them all the greatest gift in the universe: to discover that they are all Gods!
</p>

<p>
	Do you see the sheer genius of the design? It's designed to maximize love! God's great gift to the world is himself! And the only way he could give you that gift is by making you unconscious. So your unconsciousness is actually the highest form of love because it allows you to appreciate the possibility of awakening. You can't awaken unless you're alseep. God had to do it this way because he is giving the gift to himself because there is no one outside himself who he could give a gift to.
</p>

<p>
	So you'd be missing the greatest gift. But only for a finite period of time. Eventually every child wakes up. God rigged the game so no one can fail.
</p>

<p>
	Even the worst person ends up in heaven. That is God's love.
</p>

<p>
	What greater gift could exist in the universe than an infinite number of beings awakening to the fact that they are God? What greater purpose could exist? The purpose is INFINITE!
</p>

<p>
	It took God total Selflessness, Love, Goodness, and Intellect to acheive this! He's not fucking around. He used his power in the most responsible way possible, thus creating the universe as you see it today. He used his power to create paradise! For all his children to discover that they have always been in an unlimited paradise!
</p>

<p>
	If you only knew the extent of God's love for you, it would kill you. Since this love is without any trace of self. And since you are God. At the very moment that you realized this total paradise, you would be so alone that you would have no one in the universe to share it with. So your very next idea would be to create some "others" to share it with. But the only way you could do that is by making them unconscious, since otherwise they would just be you.
</p>

<p>
	The greatest tragedy of God is that he is so great he cannot share his greatness with anyone but himself. So here we are.
</p>

	It tends to be ever-increasing. It doesn't make such sense for Albert Einstein to incarnate into a kangaroo. That would be a step down.

	Consider the possibility that there are higher beings than humans that you can incarnate into after you've maxed out being human.

<p>
	Religion is not created by the mystic but by his unrealized, unpracticing followers.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about me, it's about you! What will you create? Will you be a devil? Or will you actualize Godliness?
</p>

<p>
	Of course ego will come in and corrupt my teachings -- and all teachings. It cannot be otherwise. Wherever there is truth there is devilry not far behind. The devil will never allow a mountain of truth to sit uncorrupted out in the open.

<p>
	You already have! You got bored with that and incarnated into a human. So here you are! And now you want to go back??? What's the rush? After you end all manifestation you will be bored and re-create your human self again a million times over. You'll keep doing this for infinity.
</p>

<p>
	The end of manifestation, beginning of manifestation, and the middle of manifestation are all ONE! There is nowhere to go because there is only one place in the whole universe: nowhere. And you're already there no matter where you are. Try as you might you cannot escape from yourself! Wherever you go, there you are!

<p>
	Yeah, I've been there. Realizing God can be freaky. Realizing all humans are your own imagination can be quite freaky too.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is you need a solid theoretical foundation in nonduality to help make sense of this stuff. Otherwise you'll feel extra lost.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you study some nonduality books. See my book list for dozens of great ones. That's what helps me ground my trips the most.
</p>

<p>
	Of course everything you saw was true:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		You are God
	</li>
	<li>
		You are all alone
	</li>
	<li>
		All people are your own creation
	</li>
	<li>
		Society is a lie
	</li>
	<li>
		Reality is a lie
	</li>
	<li>
		There is nothing but hallucination, and it goes on forever
	</li>
	<li>
		There is no difference between sanity and insanity
	</li>
</ul>

<p>

<p>
	Haha! You've got it precisely backwards! What could be BETTER than an eternal hallucination? It's heartbreaking in the truest sense: it's so Good and Beautiful that the Love of it breaks your heart.
</p>

<p>
	Death by Truth. Death by Love.
</p>

<p>
	What you saw is just the tip of the iceberg. There just isn't any physical world. There is only whatever you (as God) choose to hallucinate. You're hallucinating this forum post right now. And it's great! How else could anything exist as anything other than a hallucination? You are me and I am you. The circle is complete.
</p>

<p>
	Your only problem is that you lack theoretical foundation to properly ground and interpret your realizations. And this was also your first time. The first few times are freaky, then you get used to it and enjoy it. Also what you're missing is the infinite Goodness and Love of God. Your ego as taken these insights into a negative direction. That is a distortion of the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	So give yourself some time to heal and integrate these insights. Then come back for more to really understand. You've only had a tiny glimpse so far. Not enough to fully understand what you saw. Many more trips are required.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is a radical thing. It's an acquired taste.
</p>

<p>
	YES! I've felt that insanity you hit upon. That's some freaky shit. Shows you the power of God's Infinite Mind. But also great after the fact! Sanity is overrated. <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can face these things. It's merely the Truth. And nothing could be more beautiful or lovely. Just understand that your ego-mind badly distorted what you saw. It corrupted the Truth with its own petty judgments. So your negative reactions are not truthful.
</p>

<p>
	You're right. It's way too much. It's Infinite!
</p>

</p>

<p>
	It could be helpful, but probably not enough by itself. You can't really shortcut the inquiry if you want to truly awaken.
</p>

<p>
	And telling yourself, "I am God" would only be effective if you had a few glimpses already of what God is. Otherwise you'll just be filling your mind with wrong ideas of God.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that you have to SEE in your direct experience that you are God/nothing. Believing it is not good enough.
</p>

How Will creates all of physical reality?
</p>

<p>
	Have you become conscious that you designed your physical body using your own Will? Can you look at your hands and see that you are designing them right this very moment?
</p>

<p>
	Will and Being are one. Try to get a hit on that.
</p>

<p>
	Have you got a hit on Infinite Intelligence? What is intelligence in its purest form? Notice that Infinite Intelligence is materializing every physical object.
</p>

<p>
	By what method does God create? By what method are you creating this world?
</p>

<p>
	Make sure that you take FULL OWNERSHIP of yourself as God! You are doing it all! Do not offload that responsibility elsewhere! This is very important! You must realize yourself as THE CREATOR. You are not merely a nobody. You are THE CREATOR!
</p>

<p>
	The world is your creation. There is nothing and no one outside of you who is creating it. Because ONENESS.

<p>
	If Elliot Hulse is using Trump as a role model for how to be a man, God help us all. Trump is not a man, he's a man-baby. Don't be that. Watch my video above.

<p>
	Your best bet would be RSD videos.

	Game without using routines or canned lines. You gotta be as natural as possible, so your game isn't game but your authentic personality on full display.

</p>

<p>
	Of course it isn't true in any absolute sense.
</p>

<p>
	But very practically, if you want to be a high value man, you gotta teach yourself to be a provider/boss/value-generator.
</p>

<p>
	Traditionally the man's role is to hunt and bring home the wild game. Not being able to do so will hit your self-esteem. Again, simply on a practical level. We're not talking about enlightenment here. Just advice for average guys, not woke masters.
</p>

<p>
	Teach yourself how to hunt. Not to please the woman or society but to empower yourself. Hunting feels good. Which is why males of our species play first person shooter games. Females don't play such games.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: Why shouldn't you be happy that your ex is having sex? She is experiencing love and joy. Your spiritual growth is to realize that by loving her for getting love, you actualize your own love. And thereby everyone loves everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate the power of this. Your job in this life is to love everything until it hurts. Practice generatimg love on her behalf.
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot feel love for those who are happy, that's a sign of how much growing up you've got to do.
</p>

<p>
	Love her and love yourself. Then from this loving place find a new girlfriend. Remember: You can love people without having sex with them or even seeing them.
</p>

<p>
	The key to love is that it is an unlimited resource. You don't need to hoard it or trade it or hold it back in reserve because your truest nature is Infinite Love!
</p>

<p>
	Think abundance, not scarcity.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is just a lack of love.

<p>
	To me it's not so rare because I've studied lots of various masters. They are all profound in their own ways. If you have not studied many others then Sadhguru will seem rare.
</p>

<p>
	But clearly Sadhguru is great.

<p>
	That's untrue.
</p>

<p>
	Don't assume it cannot be known. It can be known.
</p>

<p>
	Both are true: you can reincarnate and God has already experienced everything. This is not a contradiction.
</p>

<p>
	Whether you reincarnate and as what you reincarnate as will depend.

	Wisdom comes from connection to God, not academics. Academics are very disconnected, so their understanding is straight-jacketed.

<p>
	If you could, you certianly couldn't explain how you do it via any conventional human paradigm of understanding.
</p>

<p>
	It would be a level of connection to God-consciousness beyond anything words could convey.
</p>

<p>
	I suspect it is possible. But only for exceptionally advanced yogis. You won't get there through self-inquiry.

	The problem is that's poison to your body and mind. And you're squandering a good opportunity.

</p>

<p>
	I'm sorta semi-lucid but not 100% God-mode lucid. Which is what to me is the ultimate goal.
</p>

<p>
	Insight is important and good, peaks are good, but most importantly is the question of your minute to minute lucidity.
</p>

<p>
	I believe it's possible to be in full God-mode all the time.
</p>

<p>
	When you do 5-MeO it clearly shows you how unwoke you still are. It's a whole order of magnitude more wokeness than ordinary life. It's clear to me that such total wokeness is possible. And I certianly don't have that yet.

<p>
	Sometimes it can. But meditation is usually more focused on hitting higher states of consciousness rather than addressing buried psychological baggage.
</p>

<p>
	There are many layers to your mind which root many of your personal problems which meditation is largely unconcerned with.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of Zen masters and enlightened masters can still have significant shadow.

		</p>

		<p>
			how do you accept your friends viewpoints, knowing that they are wrong. i've said a few things to my parents and its like talking to a brick wall, not that i expect any less ofcourse. but i'm starting to build up this energetic feeling that by the power of grace, everybody in the world finds out enlightenment is an actual thing and i can then point to my parents and say i fucking told you so! this is what i meant the whole time! even imagining the situation is giving me joy beyond belief as opposed to them thinking that i've personally been brainwashed and without logic, blindly accepting what others say like the fact i am god etc.. 
		</p>

		<p>
			like its obvious that you probably don't talk to them about how you see reality (those that don't know) not like fucking ralston lol, my real question is how do you tolerate what they say and be bothered to reply with an answer that you may know not to be true
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I mostly keep to myself. I'm not a very social person. I am happy rolling solo most of the time.
</p>

<p>
	A few intimate friends and lovers are no problem. Discussing with them is no problem usually.

<p>
	Because society makes it easy, herding you into it like a sheep.
</p>

<p>
	Now you are on your own.
</p>

<p>
	You can actually learn much faster and deeper as an adult. But no one will motivate you. It's all on you.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, since you are now trying to move beyond the center of gravity of your culture, they will actively drag you down and discourage you from trying.
</p>

<p>
	So it's all on you twice over.
</p>

<p>
	Plus you gotta pay your bills, so it's all on you thrice over.

It's not merely a matter of belief. Belief is not what creates your body, for example, but your body IS a hallucination. So this process of creation is not as easy a beleiving whatever the hell you want and it appears.
</p>

<p>
	But if you are tripping on psychedelics they open your mind up so much that you can literally imagine a devil and see it materialize before your eyes. But this is not just belief. It's the machinery of Universal Mind which spawns physical reality. You cannot access this machinery easily in ordinary states of human conscious. Because your sense of reality must be maintained to maintain your human life. Your mind works very hard to create a solid sense of "reality" otherwise the game of human life would be up.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is pervasive due to the ego's survival function and your belief in death. Growing up is all about learning to master your fear and negative thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Yes and no. Since God is all God ultimately creates all. Since you are God, you create all, including your own suffering.
</p>

<p>
	That's the trickery of nonduality. All formulations of it never quite capture both sides of it.

<p>
	It was traumatically profound. No words can do it justice.

<title>Tips for integrating a not so pleasant LSD experience ? [Trip report + questions]</title>

<p>
	Since you are God, you are the only authority that exists. So whatever you hold as the case becomes your reality. If you think you deserve punishment, you will get. If you think some adult is your authority figure, that becomes your reality. If you think you are crazy, you become so.
</p>

<p>
	What the psychedelic ultimately shows you is that all of reality is your own projection. So be careful what you think or you just might get it. If you think scary thoughts you will get scary experiences. That's how people create their own living hells.
</p>

<p>
	Such "bad" trips as yours are all part of the journey. It was exactly what you needed at this time in your life. The next trip will be different if you've learn your lessons.
</p>

<p>
	Such "bad" trips are necessary to teach you the importance of respecting these powerful substances. The lesson is: these are not toys. So next time you will be much more careful with your protocol, attitude, and setting.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically practice can get in the way of spirituality in the same way that religious church rituals do.
</p>

<p>
	Yet at the same time, without serious practice you will not get very far.
</p>

<p>
	That's what makes this work so tricky. It's a catch-22.

	Except since you are God, you get to say what happens. You have God's Will running right through you.

<p>
	This was explained in my last Spiral Dynamics video.
</p>

<p>
	No, you cannot map types to stages. Types are an independent axis. Just like how male/female cuts across all stages equally. Do not try to map males to Red or females to Green. Likewise with personality types.
</p>

<p>
	And stages and types are not the only axes. There is more. See my vid about that.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	If you are God, the question then becomes, what do you want to create? Because creation is the only game in town and there is no one but you to tell you what you should create, so whatever you decide is worthwhile to do, is what you as God will create. If you decide that nothing is worthwhile to create, that will be what you created.
</p>

<p>
	If you decide to be an angle, that's how God created angels. If you decide to be a devil, that's how God created devils. If you don't decide anything and just follow the path of least resistance, that's how God created devils. Being a devil is the default condition. Being an angle takes deliberate intention.
</p>

<p>
	And so the world is exactly as it is. A perfect inevitability.
</p>

<p>
	That is not what's being said.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation can reveal the emptiness of suffering but that doesn't help those who are not liberated. Which is why helping everyone awaken is a big goal of Buddhism and all spiritual traditions.
</p>

<p>
	The only way for the entire world to escape suffering is for the entire world to awaken together. That is exactly what evolution is moving towards: unity and love.

<title>why do you come back after you die</title>

<p>
	For the same reason people don't permanently die from a few samadhis during meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Your body/mind is not so fragile because its job is to survive at all costs. You are a survival machine which protects you against your own stupidities. The body cannot actually trust the ego to keep it alive, which is why it tortments the ego with pain, suffering, and desire. That's the body making sure the ego doesn't do something stupid that gets both of them killed.

<p>
	The biggest problem affecting the world is that people don't meditate.
</p>

<p>
	If every politician meditated and woke up, world hunger and poverty would be solved overnight.
</p>

<p>
	All material world problems are the result of lack of consciousness and unconditional love. If people were conscious that they are God's, there would not be war, theft, rape, murder, slavery, exploitation, corruption, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Look at Trump. The only thing that can cure him is meditation, which he will of course never do. So the world is as ugly as it is.
</p>

<p>
	What you don't understand yet is that all political problems are self-created by people like you. Once you realize that you will see how all these problems can be solved. You cannot solve these problems at the level of consciousness that created them.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying you should ignore poverty and war. Just the opposite, I am saying you should wake up and realize that you are contributing to them.
</p>

<p>
	Unconscious people are actually incapable of caring about ecology, poverty, inequality, and war. They only care about it when it serves their ego to do so. Thus nothing gets resolved because the care is not deep enough or all-inclusive enough. Egos resist equality because they are too threatened and scared by it. They are too busy hoarding resources for themsleves, thereby creating poverty, slavery, rape, genocide, and war.

<title>As GOD Why we can't creat any thing</title>

<p>
	Firstly, you CAN heal your body. Healing is an entire discipline. You can increase the heal rate of cancer through shear mind power. This has been proven by clinical science long ago. There exist clinics which teach how to heal cancer with mind power. And of course it works. Not 100%, but you'd be surprised how effective it can be.
</p>

<p>
	There also exist millions of psychic healers who can help heal you. The shit Jesus did is not merely a myth! An exceptionally conscious mystic will have psychic superpowers that you can hardly believe. Of course it's not 100% perfect. Don't try to formalize it. You can't formalize psychic abilities within a materialist paradigm because they are immaterial and superconscious.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, since you are God, and you can create anything out of thin air, you created this human life where you get to experience limitation. You created limitation for yourself. You just forgot. So until you wake up you will be puzzled. After you wake up you will understand that you did this to yourself precisely because you have infinite power.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, by becoming more conscious your ability to create using your mind will increase significantly. You will not get 100% freedom because for that you'd have to stop being human. To be human is to have certain limits. But right now you are nowhere near the limits of what the human mind/body can do.
</p>

<p>
	Do not underestimate the power of the mind. The entire universe is mind-stuff. You just don't know how to access it. Humans are a very crude and underdeveloped species. And you are a very crude and underdeveloped human. So there's your answer.
</p>

	Faith and love are of course great things to bring into the trip. But you never know how twisting things will get. Sometimes a trip just goes hairy for no apparent reason beyond your ability to control it.
</p>

<p>
	If you trip long enough you will get some very hairy trips. The key is to go with the flow and for fucks sake never resist them. Surrender to the hairiness. That alone with grow you a lot.

<title>Having so much free time makes me spend it unwisely</title>

<p>
	Yeah, that's why self-employment is so hard and most people just cannot do it. Because it takes serious vision and self-discipline to be able to lead yourself. Most people are sheep who suck on the tit of society. They need a boss just to tell them when to wake up, otherwise they would become vegetables.
</p>

<p>
	The self-determined life is not the easy life. The easy life is working at Starbucks for 40 years and then retiring without a single dream or deep thought about life.
</p>

<p>
	You need to have a serous over-arching vision and purpose to your life if you're gonna go it alone. You need to be a fuckin boss on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Being a successful musician is not just about musical skills. You also need marketing and business skills.
</p>

<p>
	It may be necessary to keep your dentistry gig for now. But eventually if dentistry is not your passion but music is, you want to transition to place where your music can support you. That might take some years and some clever business scheming. You'd need to build a brand of some kind.

	I don't really know what that means.
</p>

<p>
	Stick to the core principles of course. Flashy game is bad game. The best game is chill, friendly, and so natural it doesn't look like game at all.
</p>

<p>
	Seek to be totally natural, congruent, authentic, and humble. Natural, chill, and authentic works like magic.
</p>

<p>
	When you boil game down to its essence you'll discover it's just you being you to the hilt. But it takes A LOT of experience to reach that point.

<p>
	Nothing is ever right or wrong. It's a question of who you wish to be. And the consequences of your actions.
</p>

<p>
	Think twice before pissing into the wind.

	Great work!
</p>

<p>
	Except you won't really die. There is no such thing as death. Only the idea of you will die. The real YOU is immortal.
</p>

<p>
	You will jump off the cliff to your death only to realize that the canyon has no floor.

<p>
	Yes, but even if you take weeks apart the trips will still get deeper and deeper and deeper.
</p>

<p>
	It will mindfuck you either way.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful what you wish for. You are not ready to see the Full Monty. You can never be ready. It's far too radical and shocking. It will suckerpunch you. It can easily traumatize you.

<p>
	EVERYONE is attracted to high consciousness beings, not just women.
</p>

<p>
	Because God is the greatest thing you can be. And people flock to be near it like moths to a flame.
</p>

<p>
	Deep down everyone craves love and consciousness.
