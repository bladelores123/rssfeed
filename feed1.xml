The only question is, is that really what you want?

At least for now, until you find something better.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get too cute with stuff like: I'm going to master myself. Yes, of course you will. But you also want some tangible marketable skills which you can use to build a career around.
</p>

<p>
	When you commit to something like "I will master teaching" or "I will master writing" or "I will master speaking", that is a very powerful and actionable intention. It sets you on a solid and clear career path.
</p>

<p>
	When you say something like "I will master myself" I picture you 10 years from now living in your mom's basement sniffing your own farts. Because it's such a vague and abstract intention.
</p>

<p>
	What tangible things are you gonna offer the world once you've mastered you?
</p>

<p>
	The world is not gonna pay you to sit there basking in your own self-mastery.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Which should be enough to get you seriously interested in reading books about LP and doing research.
</p>

<p>
	Do you want to live a passionate life?
</p>

<p>
	Yes?
</p>

<p>
	Then how can you not be passionate about reading a few books about how to create a passionate life???
</p>

<p>
	That's like wanting to be a millionaire but then saying, "Oh man... I don't want to read these books about becoming a millionaire."
</p>

<p>
	Think it through. Connect the dots.
</p>

<p>
	As I said in the Life Is A Maze video, you're in a maze whether you like it or not. So you might as well get curious and passionate about doing research to figure this maze out. You got something more important to do?
</p>

<p>
	To be successful at life you gotta love learning about how life works. Why don't you love learning about life?
</p>

<p>
	Living up to your highest ideals is very challenging. Only very serious students of consciousness work can do it.
</p>

<p>
	And even then, it is also very important to learn to drop your ideals, as they are ultimately imaginary and stand in the way of full acceptance of reality.
</p>

<p>
	I will talk more about the downsides of having high ideals in the future.

</p>

<p>
	You are a like an arrogant freshman who thinks he knows more than the professor teaching the class, trying to school the professor. It's just naive arrogance.
</p>

<p>
	I am pointing you to things you have clearly not become conscious of yet. I'm not here trying to brainwash you into my dogma. You just haven't done enough inner work or research to understand the complexity of these issues yet.
</p>

<p>
	This is not personal, or a debate. You just need to be willing to learn and explore new perspectives. That is all. There is no need to get defensive. I am here to help you. You are not being asked to believe anything here on blind faith. You are being invited to inquire deeply and openmindedly into the true nature of what meaning, value, and morality are. Not what you think they are. Not what you want them to be. But what they ACTUALLY are: constructions of your mind.

</p>

<p>
	Which is what I was pointing out to you.
</p>

<p>
	But you keep clinging to morality as truth without being open to other possibilities. So they conversation is useless. You hold morality as an unquestionable dogma. That is the issue here.
</p>

<p>
	Love is a facet of Absolute Being. It's not a moral issue but an existential one. You're conflating love and morality.

<p>
	Hallucination is a very specific word which has a precise definition: "An appearance without substance. A purely mental phenomena which does not correspond with any external objective thing." That's reality.

What you are intuiting the is infinity nature of reality. That's because it really is infinite. Which means that you will never pin down the Truth with finite symbols or thoughts. Cause/effect is a linear, dualistic, finite scheme which cannot get at the whole of reality. It can only get at finite, limited pieces of reality. It will always be just a partial map, never the whole territory.
</p>

<p>
	The territory is truly infinite, nonlinear, and non-causal.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you can have a direct insight that every object in your room has an infinite chain of causes leading to its creation. I once become conscious that my Apple laptop power cord was created by an infinite chain of causes. What a mindfuck that was. To this day I cannot look at my power cord the same way again.
</p>

<p>
	Every object in your room has actually existed for eternity.

<title>Problems Only Being Within The Mind</title>

How you feel about a situation is definitely created by the way your mind evaluates or interprets it. And this you can definitely change with lots of consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	You may not be able to change how your son behaves. But that does not matter because the key is to change how you feel about how he behaves.
</p>

<p>
	If you were more grounded in yourself your sons action's -- as bad as they might be -- would not bother you nearly as much, and you would also be more resourceful at finding an external solution, like for example, helping him to pinpoint the root cause of his problems.
</p>

<p>
	What consciousness will teach you is to let go of control and to surrender and accept terrible things gracefully.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that you can always control every bad thing in life is foolish. It just cannot happen because fundamentally the ego is not in control of anything. Control is one of the chief illusions which consciousness work tackles. You have to learn to accept things more. Counter-intuitively, this will make you more powerful, not less.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	One = Many
</p>

<p>
	Many = One
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute reincarnates infinitely as EVERYTHING. That's nonduality. Not only that, you are ALL beings at all times right now! You just aren't conscious of it. There is no need to wait for an afterlife as you are ALL beings already right now.
</p>

<p>
	There is nowhere in the universe you can go where you are already not. You are the whole shebang!

<title>Most businesses don't want to help people. They want the opposite</title>

<p>
	The purpose of most businesses is never about helping people, it is about maximizing profit.
</p>

<p>
	So of course! Maximizing profit at the expense of others is the go-to strategy for becoming wealthy.
</p>

<p>
	This is the very definition of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	But it doesn't have to be that way. It's possible to run a conscious business that doesn't prioritize profit. Of course this means less profit. Which is why so few people choose this path.

</p>

<p>
	That is what most people do.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem with it is, it's fundamentally based on falsehood, which requires that you enter a cycle of self-denial which then creates lots of suffering and stifles your ability to be a conscious and loving human being.
</p>

<p>
	To be truly moral, you must surrender morality.
</p>

<p>
	Is it threatening to your way of life? Of course, which is why almost nobody does it. Takes massive courage and lots of inner work. But it is worth it.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive solution is to surrender your way of life.

	It's not wrong because absolutely nothing is wrong.

<p>
	But it does create suffering, and you will regret it eventually as it comes from a position of ignorance.

</p>

<p>
	Absolutely-speaking, everything has equal value.
</p>

<p>
	Relatively-speaking, some things have more survival value to you than other things. Value is a relative notion. A thing has instrumental value to you precisely because it helps the ego survive.
</p>

<p>
	You can be conscious that all human beings have equal Absolute value, but you can still be selective about who you hang out with. For example, even though a murder has the same Absolute value as a non-murder, it would be foolish and even dangerous to make friends with a bunch of murders.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make is that they then take the extra step of demonizing murders and denying that they have equal Absolute value.
</p>

<p>
	So, you can be very selective about who you choose to sleep with, but it would be a mistake to demonize and judge those women who you don't want to sleep with. Just be honest and admit to yourself, "I don't want to sleep with that person. But this does not diminish that person in any way. They can still be a good person even though I don't find them sexually attractive."
</p>

<p>
	The mistake that guys like you make is that they think like this: "That women is ugly to me, therefore she is a low, worthless human being." This is a narcissistic evaluation. You are saying that just because a person doesn't fit your survival agenda that they are somehow inherently flawed or lower. When the truth is, she just doesn't fit your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Also realize that when you call anything in reality "ugly" you are actually disowning that aspect of reality, of yourself. Because the truth is, that ugly thing you hate is actually, literally, metaphysically, your very self. So you are placing yourself in an adversarial relationship with reality, with yourself! Which is the very definition of neurosis.
</p>

<p>
	When you call a thing "ugly" you are failing to become conscious of its inherent beauty. The beauty is there no matter what. But you are failing to see it because you are being too self-centered.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to live in a non-judgmental way.
</p>

<p>
	The irony of chasing hot girls is that the karma of it always comes back to bite you in the ass and make you suffer. Just by thinking, "Oooooo... look at this hot girl, so much better than that ugly fat girl" you are causing your own misery without realizing it. When you lose that hot girl, it will hurt all the more.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying you should sleep with girls you aren't attracted to. But you might want to reconsider the way you objectify women and use them to gratify your most base, most low consciousness desires in a purely materialistic fashion. Maybe rather than basing your attraction purely on looks, you give more weight to her personality and her level of consciousness, and you focus more on how you can give her love rather than how she can please you.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason a hot girl has value to you is because you crave her. And yes, it is possible to let go of craving. The trick is convincing your ego to do it.
</p>

<title>Transcendental Meditation Effective?</title>

<p>
	Careful, it is a cult-like organization.
</p>

<p>
	You can find non-cult-like forms of meditation or yoga which are just as effective if not more effective, and without the cult ideology.
</p>

<p>
	Many cults have legit spiritual techniques that they offer to newbies, but they are still manipulative cults.

<p>
	The downside of hardwiring anything is that you then become inflexible in a rapidly changing environment.
</p>

<p>
	The most effective survival strategy is not mechanical, but highly intelligent, fluid, and conscious.

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not a model for diagnosing or understanding legit mental disorders. So watch out. Spiral Dynamics is based on "normal" or "average" people.

</p>

<p>
	The reason spiritual traditions all over the world use suffering as spiritual practice is because it awakens the mind, while pleasure and comfort usually dulls the mind into unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Same idea as cold showers.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is often done is a dysfunction, pathological, moralistic manner, which is the opposite of consciousness.

</p>

<p>
	Editing of posts is deliberately disabled after 48 hours because people abuse the editing feature to stealth-change their posts.

<p>
	Depends of course on the particular skill. There are so many!
</p>

<p>
	Lynda.com is great for all sorts of technical computer skills.
</p>

<p>
	You can pretty reliably create a six-figure income just from mastering a handful of the skills on Lynda.com

Rather, you are being invited to become conscious of how you are creating suffering. That is all.
</p>

<p>
	Don't turn consciousness work into some sort of normative morality guilt trip.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to do anything. If you want to kill yourself, you are free to do so. There are no shoulds here. It's a question of how you want to live life.
</p>

<p>
	It would be pretty stupid to live life kicking yourself in the nuts everyday. But of course you are free to do so.
</p>

<p>
	Just think about how stupid what you are saying is.
</p>

<p>
	If you had to power to stop your own suffering, you would do so without hesitation.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like you live a cushy life without having suffered deeply. One day, you will face suffering so deep you will rethink your compacent position about it.
</p>

<p>
	You have no good sense yet how deep humans can suffer.
</p>

<p>
	Let's see how you will feel after you get into a car crash and half your face burns off in the fire. At which point you post your whiney victim story here and we will respond with: "How is this any different than joy? Why is suffering bad?"
</p>

<p>
	Then you will rethink your position.
</p>

<p>
	The ego loves to talk shit and act aloof while it is safe and comfy. But then, as soon as it gets a scratch, it cries and whines about how life is terrible and unfair.
</p>

<p>
	No, enlightenment is not like another other activity or distraction. There is being inside the Matrix and then there is being outside the Matrix.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea yet how radically different enlightenment is from anything you've ever done.
</p>

<p>
	If you like sufferring, you can continue to suffer. But the truth is, you hate sufferring and would be much happier if you could deconstruct it.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic and see for yourself why consciousness is desirable.

<p>
	Depends on why you're doing it.
</p>

<p>
	What is the point of your investing?
</p>

<p>
	Also, keep in mind that just because something qualifies as a life purpose doesn't mean it should be YOUR life purpose. Your LP needs to fit you like a glove.

<p>
	Strong Determination Sitting is a good way to work on consciousness of pain.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't easy to do, but try to sit for so long that you get to the point where the excruciating pain of your sit turns into pleasure. It's a very distinct inflection point that happens during long, serious sits.
</p>

<p>
	As you sit there in pain for an hour or more, you have ample time to contemplate: What is pain? What is suffering?
</p>

<p>
	With pain and suffering it's very important to try to contemplate it WHILE IT IS HAPPENING, not after the fact. This cuts through speculation and theorizing.
</p>

<p>
	My guess is, you'd have to be pretty deeply enlightened to be able to deconstruct pain in the way Ralston talks about. Because so long as the ego is intact it will bitch and whine and moan and resist too much. A deep surrender is required.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston is talking about super-human levels of consciousness. So don't be discouraged if you can't get it fast.
</p>

<p>
	It might be easier to do this using a much simpler image, like a red triangle or white circle or the yin-yang.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, these might bore you, but if you get bored easily then that's precisely what you must work through. Boredom is the ego-mind's resistance to truth and higher consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Boredom is not easy to work through, but therein lies the spiritual purification.
</p>

<title>The Nature of Perceptions</title>

What you presently think of as perception will eventually -- at high levels of consciousness -- get recontextualized into Absolute being.
</p>

<p>
	Perception only appears to exist because the ego is co-opting Absolute being as its own "perceptions".
</p>

<p>
	In truth, you are not perceiving anything. Absolute Infinity is being itself but because you believe you were born, you are misinterpreting Absolute being as "my perceptions of reality".
</p>

<p>
	Without a belief in a separate self, there is no perception. The notion of perception carries with it a hidden implicit metaphysics: subject/object (duality). When you become really conscious, this duality collapses and you realize that perception was never taking place. Absolute being was taking place.
</p>

<p>
	This may sound like a semantic word game, but I assure you its not. It's a very radical and palpable shift in consciousness. You will feel it like getting struck with a lightning bolt. Your whole sense of reality will flip inside out as your consciousness up-shifts from relative perception to Absolute being. Visually, nothing may change, but your understanding of what you thought your visual field was will radically change.
</p>

<p>
	It's like if what you thought was a shrub swaying in the wind, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a creeping grizzly bear <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

Never buy from an unknown source.
</p>

<p>
	And on top of that, use drug testing kits to verify your substance is a genuine indole.
</p>

<p>
	Be especially suspicious of substances which don't look pure (brown, grey, yellow, pink, dirty-looking, chunky, etc.).

<p>
	As far as interpreting imagery goes, the human mind can only understand reality via images and symbols. That's what understanding is regardless of whether it is scientific or spiritual understanding, literal or poetic. There really isn't a difference between literal and poetic understanding. So the mind, especially during a trip, will use whatever images it can to understand the vast complexity of reality. All sorts of strange symbols and images can arise, and they are all relative to that mind's intellectual framework. Truth and wisdom will be communicated in whatever way works FOR THAT MIND. To a Christian mind it might be the face of Jesus, to a Hindu mind it might be the face of Vishnu, to an atheist mind it might be a mathematical formula or a logical axiom, etc.
</p>

<p>
	All of it is just arbitrary symbols which only have meaning relatively, WITHIN the framework of that person's mind. It's like a language, which only makes sense and has meaning to those people who speak the language. To an outsider, it is just noise.
</p>

<p>
	Of course dissociatives can be used for accessing profound mystical states.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is, they tend to be physically harmful to the body, and also addictive.
</p>

<p>
	Ketamine can become very addictive and prolonged usages destroys the kidneys I believe. Which is why I do not recommend them. Why take those risks when you can have mindblowing mystical experiences on totally safe and non-addictive substances like LSD, mushrooms, or DMT?
</p>

<p>
	After a 5-MeO breakthrough, even small doses of LSD or mushrooms will be fully nondual, infinite experiences.
</p>

<p>
	I don't need more than 125ug of LSD to take to me to full God-mode.
</p>

<p>
	With so many safe psychedelics to explore, I would leave dissociatives for last on the list, after you've explored 2C-B, DMT, 5-MeO, MDMA, mushrooms, etc.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, once you try 5-MeO, you will not want anything else. It is a psychedelic in a league of its own. It makes LSD seem like a toy (and LSD is no toy).
</p>

<title>Is becoming socially withdrawn a part of the Self-actualization journey?</title>

<p>
	There are healthy and unhealthy ways to be socially withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
	In the healthy version, you desire isolation so that you can focus on working on your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Many sages have socially withdrawn themselves to high degrees that would seem unhealthy to most people. But they were just hardcore in their practices. This isn't strictly necessary, but it may be for some people for some period of time until they finish their work.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, there is only the one Self, so all those other people are none other than you. So whether you are with people or not, you are still always alone.
</p>

<p>
	There is no problem being alone as long as you enjoy it and you are not becoming more and more depressed or mentally unstable.
</p>

<title>Vanity and Spiral Dynamics</title>

</p>

<p>
	When contemplating this stuff, you must probe beneath the stories and excuses like, "My Dad caused this", or "It was because of my childhood" and get to the root of why you are still attached to it. Attachments like this are always rooted in your survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	So what do you fear will happen to you if you let go of vanity and appearance?
</p>

<p>
	What would happen if you became ugly and everyone thought you were a cheap nasty whore?
</p>

<p>
	How would that hurt your ego/survival? Why are you giving people that power over you?
</p>

<p>
	What is vanity/appearance REALLY giving you? Love? Happiness? Success? Self-esteem?
</p>

<p>
	Hint: it's giving you something positive, otherwise you wouldn't keep doing it.
</p>

<p>
	What if your self-esteem was completely independent of your appearance? What would be bad about that? What if you were ugly and yet you still loved yourself just as much as when you were pretty?
</p>

<p>
	Sit down and really contemplate all that in a brutally honesty manner.
</p>

<p>
	Also, get very specific and clear about what you mean by "vanity" and "appearance", as these are very vague notions.
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness and Infinity are identical. So this Nothingness is infinitely intelligent. That's what you are intuiting but not yet fully grasping.

<title>The mechanism of creating distinctions</title>

</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, reality cannot have a substance because there is nothing within reality which can be used to as a ground, and no one to arbitrate between any truth claim.
</p>

<p>
	Being cannot know itself precisely because it is itself. Or rather, being can come to know that being is fundamentally groundless and therefore mystical.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be a ground other than emptiness because any other ground would itself be in need of another ground, and so on, ad infinitum.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, the ground vs not-ground is also a distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Here we have reached the end of language. Anything said about the Ultimate Ground (The Groundless Ground) must be self-negating because the ultimate nature of reality is nondual, but all language works by creating dualities (distinctions). So anything we could say or think about the Absolute will be dualistic, which is the opposite of what it is. But... also not the opposite! (See how I have to negate my own words when talking about it?) Because to say anything about it is to give it a specific, distinct quality. But the Absolute is unbounded, infinite. But... also it is bounded and finite! (Again, I have to negate any quality I attribute to it).
</p>

<p>
	This is why Zen is so Zen. The Truth breaks logic and language alike because the Truth is infinite while logic and language are finite.

</p>

<p>
	DO NOT think about what suffering is. OBSERVE what suffering is in your direct experience!
</p>

<p>
	You suffer every day. The next time you suffer, OBSERVE it, and contemplate what you are observing.
</p>

<p>
	Avoid speculating or philosophizing about suffering. You don't need to speculate about it, it's RIGHT THERE every day in your life!
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Not only is it there, you are creating it! Another good question to contemplate is: Why did I create this suffering? Again, avoid speculation. Stick as closely to direct experience as possible.

<p>
	Like I said, I've tried those scales and they never gave me consistent results.
</p>

<p>
	Microscoops are better.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a scale is 0.001g does not mean it can actually measure out 10mg precisely. Most of these scales will barely even register a 10mg dose. It will read as zero on the scale many times. These scales assume you're weighting a fairly heavy object to begin with, like 100mg, then it will give you 0.001g accuracy. But not on a 10mg sample.

</p>

<p>
	You can intuit and trust, but none of that it is direct consciousness of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to get lulled into a false sense of comfort with such trust. Billions of religious people do it every day, and it becomes a huge obstacle to awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Trust, but verify.
</p>

<p>
	That's where 5-MeO becomes very handy. It will show you where that trust fully leads.
</p>

<p>
	Right now it's sort of like you're saying, "Yeah, I trust that Japan is a real place. I've never been, but I trust it."
</p>

<p>
	Okay, that's better than distrusting Japan. But it's a whole nother thing to actually go to Japan and roam the streets of Tokyo. It would be a trap to trust in Japan so much that you never actually bother traveling there. None of your ideas about Japan can compare to actually being in Japan.

<p>
	Distinction is a very tricky issue because distinction is the very nature of being.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully understood what a distinction was, you would understand the ultimate nature of reality, and you would be deeply enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Distinction is NOT a concept!</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Distinction is the "substance" of reality. And what then is the nature of a distinction? Nothing!
</p>

<p>
	Yes, paradox here is not a mistake. What you're starting to intuit is that reality has no substance. It's a set of distinct appearances which are actually just a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not made out of matter or atoms or energy. Reality is made out of distinctions!
</p>

<p>
	Creation is distinction. Without distinction you have pure formless Infinity. And with distinction, you also have pure Infinity! The formed side of Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Form is formlessness. Formlessness is form.
</p>

<p>
	Duality is none other than nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity contains an infinite number of distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	It's highly worthwhile to contemplate: What is a distinction?
</p>

<p>
	-------
</p>

<p>
	Mind vs not-mind = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Automatic vs not automatic = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness vs unconsciousness = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Real vs unreal = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Subjective vs objective = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Truth vs falsehood = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Creation vs destruction = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	The universe vs me = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	------
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the substanceless substance within which all of these distinctions occur. Like an LCD screen on which images are rendered.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you've ever seen or thought or experienced is a distinction. Including existence itself.
</p>

<p>
	SD is a complex model which requires serious study and contemplation to understand fully.
</p>

<p>
	All of these issues you brought are up only apparent issue because you haven't fully understood the model yet and you are not quite properly interpreting history. For example America was not more Green in the 60's than today. That is confusing the hippie movement with the average level of the entire country. In the 60's America was heavy Blue/Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Atheists are not Blue, they are just stubbornly Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Each stage builds on all the prior ones, so there is no contradiction in a Green or even Turquoise person starting a business. Business takes place at every stage, just following different values.

Those milligram scales are still way too imprecise. They cannot properly measure a 10gm dose. To them, 10mg to 20mg all feels the same. I have used several different milligram scales and they are all terrible.

<p>
	Teachers have different styles. This is why its good to study hundreds of different perspectives. Each one will expose you to some new facet that the other ones didn't.
</p>

<p>
	Teachers place different emphasis on things due to their unique personality, cultural background, path through life, and even their gender or level of testosterone.
</p>

<p>
	Never expect one teacher to explain everything to you. It just isn't possible.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, finding a teacher who you resonant with perfectly is bad because then you will tend to blindly accept what he/she says without thinking for yourself or considering other sources.
</p>

<p>
	Focus more on grasping what is being taught in your direct experience rather than daydreaming about or judging the teacher.
</p>

<p>
	The teacher you resonate with very much depends on what your particular needs are at this moment in time. In a few years, as your needs change, so will your teachers -- if you don't commit yourself to worshiping just one.
</p>

<p>
	My teachings are definitely not complete, and definitely contain some mistakes and shadow. This is not a problem so long as you think for yourself, make use many sources, and do your reading. Just listening to me is not enough to succeed in this work.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	He sort of bucks the trend.
</p>

<p>
	Although of course most people reading his books have no idea what he's really pointing to, or ever do the practice he suggests. He sort of obscures the practice with all his smartassery and story-telling.

<p>
	Jed's work is sort of a cult classic.

The only thing is that you haven't really gone all the way yet. You got a small glimpse, but not the Full Monty.
</p>

<p>
	When plugging, it's very important to make sure that your bowels are empty, otherwise the substance will not absorb fully.
</p>

<p>
	Measuring 5-MeO using a micro-scoop is far superior than using a scale. Scales are just not sensitive enough. Get a micro-scoop on Amazon (like this: <a href="https://amzn.to/2oguKiE" rel="external nofollow">https://amzn.to/2oguKiE</a> ) and use the same micro-scoop each time so your doses are consistent.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you might need to smoke it to get the Full Monty. Or just increase your plugged dose.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, at high doses, it gets freaky.
</p>

<p>
	But having that Fully Monty breakthrough is paramount. Until then, you still don't understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	Doing it with Octavio should definitely get you a breakthrough. Smoking is MUCH more intense than plugging. Plugging is like a walk in the park compared to smoking it. With smoking, the ego should not be able to hold on or resist in any way.
</p>

<p>
	Because no one would buy it if it said, "You gotta do 10,000 hours of work".
</p>

<p>
	People want easy answers. That is what sells.
</p>

<p>
	The popularity of your product/service in the marketplace is directly proportional to how easy and effortless you make your solution sound.
</p>

<p>
	"Enlightenment In 15 Minutes" << That's the video every fool clicks on.
</p>

<p>
	The most serious teachers, who emphasize hard work, are the ones you'll never hear of because they are not mass market.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: The Deep Problem of Marketing.
</p>

<p>
	To sell enlightenment effectively, you gotta simplify it and dumb it down to the point that hardly anyone who listens to you will ever attain it.
</p>

<p>
	If a guru told you what enlightenment really is, no one would buy it.

</p>

<p>
	Identity creates attachment and clinging, which is sort of the definition of dysfunction.
</p>

<p>
	America has plenty of unhealthy strict Blue too. Look at the Catholics, Evangelicals, and Mormons.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever a meme is turned into an ideology, into "the truth", it becomes toxic because all memes are partial and limited. They are never the full Truth.

<p>
	I guess I should have been more clear: solving the master does not merely mean enlightenment. It means solving the entire maze of your life, which is a far greater undertaking than just enlightenment. It includes mastery of relationships, career/biz, finances, art, health, emotions, etc. Even an enlightened perosn still needs to figure this stuff out, or at least to figure out that he is renoucing them.
</p>

<p>
	Mastering the maze requires detailed knowledge of the maze, which can only be acquired through books. I don't just mean spirituality books. You don't need to read 300 spirituality books.

	I am supportive of therapy. It just isn't sufficient by itself to resolve the maze.

<p>
	The therapist him/herself usually has no idea about the maze or how to escape it.

<title>7 Pillars of Strategic Thinking: Concentration of Force</title>

Internal vs external is a conceptual duality.
</p>

<p>
	Generally-speaking, competition is a bad strategy for life. Be a creator, not a competitor. All competitors eventually lose because there's always a bigger fish. In the time and energy you waste competing you could have created something beautiful and valuable.
</p>

<p>
	I explain all this in the Life Purpose Course.
</p>

<p>
	Competition is such a limiting paradigm. You are fighting a war which does not need to be fought. Which is the greatest strategic blunder.

<p>
	This was obvious from the day one, even to most establishment Republicans. Trump's entire life/career is a house of cards held together with lies. From his fake hair to his fake bone spurs to his fake news to his fake university to his fake charity to his fake wife. Everything in Trump world is a cheap fake. That is Trump entire MO. Fake, fake, fake your way to the bank.

	It works great until you get your hand caught in the cookie jar.

<p>
	The problem with con-artists is that they never know when to quit while they're ahead.

<p>
	I see you guys are not actually contemplating what ideology is.
</p>

<p>
	Ideology is NOT the entire domain of thought!
</p>

<p>
	One can think and conceptualize without being ideological about it.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with lumping all thought and speech into ideology, as if there is only nonduality or ideology.

</p>

<p>
	He just represents the healthiest aspects of Blue/Green. Don't forget that Blue & Green can be very healthy. They don't have to be raving lunatics.
</p>

<p>
	What Rogers is speaking against in that video is Orange vulgarity. Orange is all for showing tits and violence on TV for the sake of profits. Which Rogers would have a serious problem with because of his Blue values of propriety and decorum.
</p>

<p>
	Just his manner of speaking is Blue Blue Blue. Formal and proper.
</p>

<p>
	"Protect our innocent children" is a common trope for Blue and Green stages.

</p>

<p>
	You assume that to be enlightened is something the ego-self acquires. Which is of course a false assumption. Just stop assuming that. You were told from the very beginning that you are an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	I don't understand people who learn this and then start to exclaim that you cannot be enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	To say that you became enlightened never meant that ego acquired enlightenment. It always meant that ego dissolved and empitness dawned. That is what becoming enlightened means.
</p>

<p>
	Why quibble over something so obvious?

</p>

<p>
	Wheat is just empty calories. Why do you think everyone eats it? It's cheap empty calories. That is all. It has no nutritional value. You might as well just eat spoonfuls of white sugar. At least the sugar won't cause autoimmune reactions.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't rocket science. Just basic common sense. You are fed wheat for the same reason cows and chickens are feed grain. It's the cheapest fuel there is.
</p>

<p>
	Peasants, soldiers, slaves, prisoners, and animals are fed bread. That's what makes society run. Not oil, grain.
</p>

<p>
	That's the problem right there.
</p>

<p>
	Your business has no actual meaning for you, despite outward appearances.
</p>

<p>
	Business must be designed to serve some higher purpose than money.
</p>

<p>
	You don't actually have a life purpose yet. Making money is not a life purpose.

	And that's all it will ever be for you until you exit your mind.
