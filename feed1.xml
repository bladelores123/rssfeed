	No, most people aren't trolls and they got bigger fish to fry than using a fascist clown for entertainment.

	The 50,000+ people who commit suicide in America every year say otherwise.

<p>
	It's not worse because from the fetus' POV, it has no idea what life is and therefore it is not missing anything.

<p>
	You only value life because you've been alive for so long. An 8 week fetus does not value life or care about life. You are projecting your adult values and ideas onto the fetus.

<p>
	That's a rather different situation.

<p>
	A) To know the fetus' sex is already a pretty late stage of abortion. It's far less problematic to do the abortion early.

<p>
	If we had a very good socialist run state with excellent foster care support, excellent free education, excellent free food programs, excellent free healthcare services -- then we could even ban late tern abortions.
</p>

<p>
	Although don't forget that carrying a baby for 9 months can take a huge toll on a woman's body. She has to be willing pay that cost.

<p>
	Mein Kampf is a terrible source because you're reading his own ego-mind's rationalizations.

<p>
	He absolutely did.
</p>

<p>
	Where did all his ideas come from? He certainly didn't invent them. They were in vogue his era. No human mind naturally comes out as Hitler's did. That kind of worldview only comes from deep indoctrination and cultural programming. Frustrated with his personal life, Hitler found succor in radical right-wing ideologies which were popular at the time. He turned his life's purpose into fighting his own shadow. He chose the lesser vs the Greater Jihad. And of course he would not admit this to you if you asked him because he was unconscious of these ego dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	The goal of world domination was just part of his indoctrination in ultra right-wing nationalism which believed that Germans are the best ethnicity and their proper place is to rule over all the others.
</p>

<p>
	His project to exterminate the Jews was even more important to him than world domination. Hitler diverted a lot of energy way from fighting WWII towards exterminating Jews. If Hitler hasn't been so obsessed with exterminating Jews, he might have actually won the war.
</p>

<p>
	My analysis is anything but surfacy.

<p>
	But I never bothered to seriously understand Lacan. It's just way too arcane and impractical in my opinion. There are better things to spend your time studying.
</p>

<p>
	And I do not buy into the Oedipal Complex. In the history of Western intellectual tradition, I think it's one of the dumbest and most overrated ideas. It won't help you improve your life.

<p>
	Don't forget to take into account the suffering of being born and raised by parents who A) do not want you or love you, and B) are not equipped to provide for you financially or psychologically.
</p>

<p>
	The most common reason for having an abortion is simply that you are not ready or willing to raise a child. Forcing people into raising children when they do not want to, or are not mature enough to do so, is going to have serious downstream fallout. More school shooters, more criminals, more psychopaths, more terrorists, more suicides, more depression, more mental illness, more drug addicts, more drug overdoses. All of that is directly related to bad upbringing from immature or impoverished parents.

			The technology described seems to be so advanced, to assume that we can shoot such a thing down is to me quite unrealistic. From the speculation we are hearing, this thing might not even be travelling at all, instead it is pushing through space itself, sucking itself through it so to speak. It's not actually moving, in other words if you were to be inside that thing and it was moving with 10x speed of light, you wouldn't feel a thing. It would be as if you'd stand on a non-moving object.
		</p>

		<p>
			When it is moving through the air, it is not actually interacting with the air, which is why it doesn't seem to cause a sonic boom. It doesn't actually push any molecules while it is travelling, because it is not actually travelling. I don't understand the hypothetical physics of this, but I am not sure if it couldn't just fly through a wall. That's how advanced that technology might be.
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			Also to think that giving us this kind of technology would be in any shape or form a good idea is very naive aswell. It would be like giving a bazooka to a chimp. Humans can barely keep up with the technology they themselves are creating, just think about if nuclear weapons had been invented a decade earlier, in another part of the world, like for example Nazi Germany. You don't try to teach a 4 year old to drive a car, the mind of the 4 year old is not ready. The same is true for us as mankind. We might not even be biologically capable of responsibly using that kind of technology. It might be that we will first need to actually change the structure of our brains and minds for us to deal with it on a larger scale.
		</p>

		<p>
			Don't forget, at some point technology might become so advanced that a single dysfunctional mind could annihilate all life on a planet. A single "school shooter" type could destroy all life on earth, if technology was advanced enough.
		</p>

		<p>
			This kind of dysfunctionality cannot even be given a chance to exist before a certain technological point has been reached. It cannot even be 1 out of a trillion people. It has to be a mind completely alien to ours, a mind that has no capacity for primitive desires like jealousy, hatred, fear and so forth.
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			The fact that there are people who would ever shoot down an alien aircraft to gain an imaginary benefit is all the reason why the aliens would deem us far too immature to do so. They might deem us so unadvanced that giving us any kind of advanced technology would be like giving ants nuclear weapons.
		</p>

		<p>
			And equally, any technology that we might be given could be equally incomprehensible as a nuclear reactor is to an ant. A human mind might not even be capable of comprehend any type of understanding of how and what that technology is, or how it has been created. That's how advanced they could be.
		</p>

		<p>
			Don't forget, if a species reaches a certain level of development it might be capable of intelligently "evolving" a structure that gives rise to a mind that would not be created in trillions and trillions of years of natural evolution. The wisdom of nature and all it's organism would seem like a child building something out of legos.

You need to need to clarify what aspects of creativity you want to manifest, how, and why.

<p>
	There are at least a million unique ways to manifest creativity.

<title>Collecting Questions For 1 Million Subs AMA Special Video</title>

<p>
	Welp, we're getting close to 1 million subs and I suppose an AMA/Q&A video is warranted.
</p>

<p>
	Post your question here and I may select to answer it in the video, which will probably be released in mid-October.
</p>

<p>
	Try to keep your questions not too dumb. I expect there will be many questions and not all of them can possibly make it into the video so I will be selective, so make your question good if you want a realistic chance of it being answered.
</p>

<p>
	I will also be collecting questions via YT comment section around the end of September.
</p>

			The very question "Where does change come from?" is implying that you are asking in the realm of time. In the realm where things have a beginning and an end. But this is just imagination. There is not really change in reality. There is only nothing. All change is just an appearance of change, it borrows reality from the changeless eternal subject. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But there is also benefit here for the changeless eternal subject, because it enjoys those illusions of change. That's probably why it merges its reality with all objects within itself.
		</p>

		<p>
			There is only ever nothingness, all appearances, no matter how real they look, are just skillful illusions. And I cannot say from direct experience where those skillful illusions come from and who/what is generating them and why. It's a movie and I appear to be the character. And you appear to be another character... But if we watch direct experience now, as you have taught me to do, I exist AS the ultimate reality - I have never changed EVER, only appearances in me change. I cannot tell how they change or why. My best guess would be that it's my imagination.

			Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Col.): “I think we’re too close to the election. The president who is elected in November should be the one who makes this decision.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas): “I believe the American people deserve to have a voice in the selection of the next Supreme Court Justice, and the best way to ensure that happens is to have the Senate consider a nomination made by the next President."
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas): “It has been 80 years since a Supreme Court vacancy was nominated and confirmed in an election year. There is a long tradition that you don’t do this in an election year.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.): “I don’t think we should be moving on a nominee in the last year of this president’s term — I would say that if it was a Republican president .”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.): “It makes the current presidential election all that more important as not only are the next four years in play, but an entire generation of Americans will be impacted by the balance of the court and its rulings. Sens. Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid have all made statements that the Senate does not have to confirm presidential nominations in an election year. I will oppose this nomination as I firmly believe we must let the people decide the Supreme Court’s future.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): “A lifetime appointment that could dramatically impact individual freedoms and change the direction of the court for at least a generation is too important to get bogged down in politics. The American people shouldn’t be denied a voice.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa): “We will see what the people say this fall and our next president, regardless of party, will be making that nomination.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.): “Vice President Biden’s remarks may have been voiced in 1992, but they are entirely applicable to 2016. The campaign is already under way. It is essential to the institution of the Senate and to the very health of our republic to not launch our nation into a partisan, divisive confirmation battle during the very same time the American people are casting their ballots to elect our next president.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.): “The very balance of our nation’s highest court is in serious jeopardy. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will do everything in my power to encourage the president and Senate leadership not to start this process until we hear from the American people.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wisc.): “I strongly agree that the American people should decide the future direction of the Supreme Court by their votes for president and the majority party in the U.S. Senate.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.): “In this election year, the American people will have an opportunity to have their say in the future direction of our country. For this reason, I believe the vacancy left open by Justice Antonin Scalia should not be filled until there is a new president.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.): “There is 80 years of precedent for not nominating and confirming a new justice of the Supreme Court in the final year of a president’s term so that people can have a say in this very important decision.”
		</p>

		<p>
			Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio): “I believe the best thing for the country is to trust the American people to weigh in on who should make a lifetime appointment that could reshape the Supreme Court for generations. This wouldn’t be unusual. It is common practice for the Senate to stop acting on lifetime appointments during the last year of a presidential term, and it’s been nearly 80 years since any president was permitted to immediately fill a vacancy that arose in a presidential election year.”

	I love the mental gymnastics that all these Reps will be going through over the next 2 months.

<p>
	It will be a masterclass in grade AA bullshit.

<p>
	No. We use change to measure time, but time is a concept that is superimposed over change. Change can happen without time.
</p>

<p>
	A tree changes but it has no notion of time.
</p>

<p>
	If you stop imagining time, it will stop existing. But change will still happen. The change will happen within eternity.

<p>
	Change and eternity are one.

<p>
	Look for one who has an understanding of spirituality/nonduality/meditation.
</p>

<p>
	And you really want to test a therapist, ask the therapist if you're God and observe their reaction.
</p>

<p>
	Ask them:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is love?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is truth?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is consciousness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is science?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is therapy?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is happiness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is suffering?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is mind?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is ego?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is healing?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	And observe their responses. This will tell you everything about them.

<p>
	They could even ram it through after Trump loses but before he leaves office.
</p>

<p>
	That would be the most devilish move. Act like they won't ram it through for 6 weeks, then ram it through before January as a final F-you to the Libs.
</p>

<p>
	But they are probably too greedy for such a move. They will want to ram it through immediately.
</p>

<p>
	Reps have to be very careful here, because how greedily they pounce on this could cost them the whole election across the board.
</p>

<p>
	If Reps got their judge but lost across the board, I think that would be net win for America.

<p>
	The Supreme Court is already lost. Dems won't stop that.
</p>

<p>
	But there will be hell to pay as people get outraged at Republicans over it.
</p>

<p>
	Majority of people support liberal judges. 75% of the country supports abortion. So these moves the Republicans are making are anti-democratic and they will not be able to sustain that. People will get outraged. People are already outraged. When the will of the majority is not honored, there will be civil unrest.

<p>
	When this happened under Obama, they blocked Obama's judge for over a year until Trump won and picked his own.
</p>

<p>
	Mitch McConnell stole 1 seat from Obama while arguing that it was warranted because the election was just over a year away. Now the election is 6 weeks away, but McConnell don't give a fuck.
</p>

<p>
	There would be no problem if Obama got his judge: as is Constitutionally required.
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty gross that Republicans were able to steal a judge so blatantly and shamelessly.

	From what I understand, no it doesn't. The Constitution does not specify the exact number of judges.

<p>

<p>
	Yes, exactly. But it will be a huge public battle, bigger than Kavanaugh. People will see that the Republicans are overplaying their hand right before the election.
</p>

<p>
	This is potentially very dangerous for Republicans if they overplay it. And it looks like they will.
</p>

<p>
	This will mobilize a lot of enthusiasm for Biden. Biden has a lot going for him now, after this and Covid.

<p>
	This will actually increase Biden's chances of winning now. The more right-wing the country turns before the election, the more it will swing in the other direction in November.
</p>

<p>
	Being so aggressively, monstrously right-wing is what may cause the Republicans to lose all 3 branches in Nov.

<p>
	Yes, he will, if they see him side by side with Trump.
</p>

<p>
	Joe Biden is not like Hillary Clinton. He doesn't have strong disapproval ratings. Most people would be happy with Joe Biden. He comes off as a decent, reasonable guy. Only the fringes of both sides strongly oppose him. It's very hard to paint Joe Biden as some radical or crazy person. He feels competent, and right now I think most people just want some competent non-divisive leadership.
</p>

<p>
	All Biden has to do is present himself as reasonable and competent. Trump should self-destruct.

<p>
	Well, people have different metabolisms, but I think your fat gain is more the result of other stuff you eat than something like avocado oil.
</p>

<p>
	To gain 5kg per week you'd need to eat 5 entire crates of avocados. 5kg = 38,500 calories. 1 large avocado = 235 calories. So you'd need to eat 163 avocados per week. And that doesn't even take into account the fact that you burn about 2,000 calories per day.
</p>

<p>
	Here's an even better diet:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Only carbs from non-starchy vegetables and low/med-sugar fruits like blueberries, apples, oranges, etc. No bean, no lintels, no corn, no rice, no wheat, no oats.
	</li>
	<li>
		Have 3 recipes you cycle so you don't get bored.
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't drink calories other than low-sugar veggie juices like tomato, celery, cucumber, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Liberal use of high quality oils like olive, avocado, coconut.
	</li>
	<li>
		Lots of lean protein like chicken or turkey. Or eggs if you tolerate them.
	</li>
	<li>
		No cheat days.
	</li>

	Sure you will. Your mind will also work better. You will have more energy.

<p>
	I pour a ton of avocado oil on everything I eat. I go through a few bottles of it per week. It has a nice neutral taste, unlike olive oil, which tends to be bitter.

<p>
	You can imagine whatever you want. The only problem is that your mind has biases. You imagine that some things are better than other things, which isn't ultimately true.
</p>

<p>
	Seriously contemplate this: Why would one thing be better than any other? It isn't! Only due to your selfishness.

	Does a rock care if it gets kissed, spanked, raped, crushed, melted? Nope. Because the rock is unbiased. The rock is selfless.

</p>

<p>
	Personal development is all about doing research and testing stuff out. Don't expect anyone else to that for you. No therapist will do it for you. And I will not do it for you either.
</p>

<p>
	If you are short on money, I would stay away from therapy and focus on doing your own research and lifting yourself up by your bootstraps. You can read books on any problem you have, like low self-esteem, which will tell you how to start fixing it.

<p>
	Losing weight is so easy. All you have to do is stop eating carbs and only eat 75% the size of your typical meals so your stomach remains not full. Walk around with a slightly hungry stomach. And just keep doing that every day for a few months. Just get used to that empty stomach feelings.
</p>

<p>
	That's it. Simple. Going to the gym is hardly necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Cleaning up your diet is priority #1. No junk, no sugar, no wheat, no grains, no rice, no corn, no potatoes, no sweet drinks of any kind. If you are strict on that, you will lose weight effortlessly and never have to worry about yo-yoing or putting it back on.
</p>

<p>
	God doesn't need to. Ego does so out of fear.
</p>

<p>
	At a higher level, God imagines "others" so that it can share its Love. Without an imaginary other there is no one to share Love with.

<p>
	Absolute does change. Non-change and change are One. Absolute includes everything possible.
</p>

<p>
	If you have some idea of the absolute as being a static thing, drop it. The absolute is not limited to that. It's unlimited.

<p>
	I slept normally, about 8 hrs.
</p>

<p>
	I just didn't have much of a social or family life.
</p>

<p>
	I didn't do it for long. It took me about 6 months to become financially independent and quit my day job. But this is unusually fast. In many ways I got lucky. Most people won't be able to pull that off. But I was very creative and ambitious.
</p>

<p>
	If you are creative, strategic, ambitious, and manipulative enough, you can achieve amazing results rather quickly. Although that does take a toll on your soul.

<p>
	All stages are actually states. The difference being that these states are more long-lasting and stable than what people normally consider states.
</p>

<p>
	There are brief and unstable states vs long and "permanent" states (stages). Of course nothing is truly permanent. Even your enlightenment will be lost at some point.

<p>
	For an atheist, God does not exist. Because he imagines it does not. Althought he is God imagining that there is no God, and thereby making it true, but he in such a state that he cannot be aware of it, and thus God has locked himself out his own house.

<title>Why should I be good to others?</title>

<p>
	If there was a reason for being good, then it wouldn't be good. Contemplate it.
</p>

<p>
	For good to be good, it must be done for its own sake. Selflessly. Which is why Good = selflessness. If you are trying to do good for a reason, that is selfishness, and that is evil.

<p>
	It's very simple. It all hinges on your state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that Infinity is forgotten. Infinity is a state of consciousness. You cannot access Infinity without the proper state no matter how much you think or remember.
</p>

<p>
	Duality is a state of consciousness.

			Are you ever going to be willing to play the role of a student or admit when you're wrong, relatively speaking? Does it always have to be your way or the highway? I wanted to see if you could see/understand what i am saying and instead you are controlling the dynamic with your god-consciousness pedestal and rigid beliefs about reality. I call them rigid because you discount so much, you claim it's not as conscious or deep as you've been as if that's the whole point of the spiritual journey. It's not, expansion is about connection, not division, not keeping people below you or in a state of seeking "the infinite". Where's your humility regarding differing view/opinions? It seems to me what you hold onto is fear, unwilling to entertain certain structures of belief, realities outside of your own, because they threaten your sanity and survival. I am not going to battle you on the meaning of god-consciousness, why would i want to exclude your way about it? I just won't agree with how you claim it to be the only "true" explanation of enlightenment.

<p>
	What I told you wasn't personal. It is what it is. If you want to play your games, that will not change the underlying truth of what was said. You cannot argue or manipulate your way out of a low state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is a radical change in your state of consciousness. The end. Nothing to argue about. You can explain it however you want.

<p>
	Someone earning $300 per week DOES NOT pay $100 in taxes in America.
</p>

<p>
	I've been earning 6 figures for the last decade, and I have never paid over 33% effective tax rate. And nearly all my income was self-employed cash income. Which is taxed at the highest rates.
</p>

<p>
	Effective tax rate is always significantly lower than the tax bracket rates.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Of course if you include sales tax and property tax, then it may get over 30%. But I'm talking Federal.

<p>
	America doesn't have too much taxes.
</p>

<p>
	Effective tax rates are very low.
</p>

<p>
	People just love to bitch out paying taxes because their minds get infected with that libertarian ideology which says that you have no responsibility to society.

<p>
	That kind of thinking is usually what keeps you poor.
</p>

<p>
	Real wealth is built methodically over time.
</p>

<p>
	When you try to take shortcuts, it often takes longer since all your schemes devolve into leeching money from others without providing serious value -- which always collapses in on you, forcing to begin again from scratch each time.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, there's nothing wrong with strategically looking for high-paying job.

<p>
	In practice it's a viable and even necessary strategy for many people because you gotta eat.
</p>

<p>
	But the real solution in this case is to basically work twice as hard to claw your way out of wage slavery.
</p>

<p>
	So during the day you work to pay your bills.
</p>

<p>
	And during the nights and weekends you work to build your future career/biz.
</p>

<p>
	That's how I did it. It's difficult, but totally worth it if your body can handle it.

<p>
	How could it be otherwise?
</p>

<p>
	You simply haven't contemplated what Consciousness and Love are deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	If you do, you will realize that Consciousness = Love = Nothing = Everything
</p>

<p>
	You are subtly creating a duality between the void and not-void. When in fact void and not-void are One.

There simply isn't a large % of people in America who are progressives.
</p>

<p>
	How can a progressive candidate win in a democracy when the majority of voters are not progressive?
</p>

<p>
	It's just so simple.
</p>

<p>
	A guy like Bernie will win the presidency only when something like half the country is progressive.
</p>

<p>
	Your mama and papa ain't progressives. Contemplate that.

	I have already answered this question many times. I won't be explaining it to you yet again.

	Vaush has hit the mother-lode with this caller:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">

	</div>
</div>

<p>
	I like that in the end Vaush is conscious enough to understand that he needs to get better a communicating with stage Blue people. Although he still doesn't understand that the failure to communicate is a function of different level of consciousness and ego development.

<p>
	Because I've interacted with such people and they do not understand that they are God. They are lost in a higher plane of spiritual phenomena. The astral realms and all the beings there are just another dream.
</p>

<p>
	Most psychics and healers are not awake. Although they are more much conscious than normies.
</p>

<p>
	This is where a lot of New Agey, Teal Swan-like stuff comes from. Teal Swan says she's an alien. Well, actually, she's God imagining to be an alien.

His bluster is merely an overcompensation of his own weakness. He's a weakling posturing as a strongman.
</p>

<p>
	But nevertheless, he is a highly skilled con artist and bullshittter who spreads untruth, delusion, and corruption. And that alone is dangerous in the information age. Rolling tanks through the streets is no longer the main issue in the 21st century. The real issue is corruption of peoples' minds.

<p>
	Yes, definitely. That's what most psychics, healers, channelers, and astral projectors are doing.
</p>

<p>
	They easily get lost in those things while not being conscious of the ultimate truth: that they are God dreaming everyone else up. It's not much different than getting lost in material life.

<p>
	He already has orchestrated it.
</p>

<p>
	Trump certainly cannot be a serious dictator, because he is not a serious person, but he can destroy American from within like a saboteur or con artist by polarizing the culture war. Which is exactly his entire strategy and talent. The greatest damage he's doing is radicalizing average people to believe in his egoically twisted version of reality. The brainwashing of the American culture and people by right-wing politics is extremely problematic and dangerous. And it has already happened.
</p>

<p>
	The only question is how to cure this cancer of the collective mind.

So his followers will feel outraged even if he loses. They will precieve it as radical socialists trying to steal an election.

<p>
	Laws and courts cannot kick Trump out, only the military high command can. And they will be very hesistant to get involved.
</p>

<p>
	Congress cannot kick him out. And 95% of conservatives in Congress will feel that Trump won even if he loses because they just want to keep power.
</p>

<p>
	It's gonna be a complete clusterfuck. Trump will take the whole country down with him.

	Syrian rue is never taken days before the trip. You take it with the DMT, in small amounts.

<p>
	Your tone and attitude is simply not reflective of someone engaged in consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	You are here trying to argue and start debates and push your pet opinions. That's not how we operate here.

<p>
	Sounds like you took too much.
</p>

<p>
	Start with small doses and contemplate reality. There is little point in tripping if you have no clue what is happening.

<p>
	That sounds like a massive dose. Why are you fooling around with such doses?
</p>

<p>
	Combining syrian rue with psychedelics can be extremely dangerous as it will multiply the trip potency by 10x. A 60 gram dose would probably have been given you a horrible trip. And if you combine that with something like 5-MeO-DMT, you will kill yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you're going to take rue, take pure harmaline extract in the 0.5 gram range.
</p>

<p>
	Syrian rue will likely make you vomit and it is psychedelic all on its own at high doses.
</p>

<p>
	I listened to the allegations today and they didn't seem as bad as "forced sterilizations". Seems like one corrupt doctor.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to jump to conclusion. Bad doctors are a thing. There needs to be much more serious proof for the "forced sterilization" claim.

<p>
	Maybe they have tech which can scan a person's mind and extract all the knowledge, data, beliefs, ego development level, etc. But to use that tech they need to abduct a few folks.

	All sorts of combinations are possible. There are not hard rules.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you pretty much guaranteed to have various profound insights even after your first few awakenings.
</p>

<p>
	Your first few awakenings are not going to make everything crystal clear. You should still have many questions remaining.

<p>
	His consciousness model is interesting and somewhat useful, but I would not conflate it with Cook-Greuter's work. They are very different.
</p>

<p>
	Any model that tries to map consciousness on a linear scale is extremely problematic. Conscious states are not at all linear or one-dimensional.

<p>
	There are many degrees of this giftedness.
</p>

<p>
	I certainly have some degree of it, but there are people who have it 100x more than me.
</p>

<p>
	I would say that I am mildly gifted. My mind is gifted with extraordinary intuition, holistic intelligence, and wisdom. This has basically always been the case for me. It is not something I worked to achieve. Although my inner work cranked it up to 11. But I am not gifted in the same way that psychics, healers, and yogis are.

	Things will stabilize for you. This is just a phase. Just keep reminding yourself that this is a process and it will stabilize. You just gotta be patient with it. Don't get pushy with it. Let it unfold organically. Be open to wherever it wants to take you.

<p>
	I don't see how it makes a difference. You can crank up the plugged dose as high as you want.
</p>

<p>
	A longer trip is not going to dissolve the ego any less than a short trip, just the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	It's not like you will come back from a 4 hour 5-MeO trip and be like, "Well, that was full nonduality, but it lasted for 4 hours instead of 15 minutes, therefore it isn't permanent enlightenment."

<p>
	There is a difference between abducting a few individuals vs first contact.
</p>

<p>
	First contact means that every culture and country in the world would officially recognize aliens as real. There would be no more doubt or speculation.
</p>

<p>
	The TV news would be wall-to-wall alien coverage. People would be going nuts.

<p>
	He's already laying the groundwork.
</p>

<p>
	Trump will never admit defeat, even if he loses both the popular vote and electoral college. He has already blamed any future loss on Democrat rigging and fraud. No matter what happens the Democrats will be scapegoated and gaslit for the loss. Everything Trump does to rig the system he will blame on Democrats and progressives.

<p>
	Oh, his health looks good enough to be alive.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem for him is: you have to be out of prison to run for president.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump loses, there's a good chance he's going to prison. Tons of criminal cases pending against him.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why he will refuse to leave office. For Trump, leaving office is basically a prison sentence. He needs the immunity.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because humans are not yet evolved enough to take first contact as a positive thing. Humans are so dumb and fearful that we would turn it into paranoia.
</p>

<p>
	These aliens have probably interacted with many other species in the universe so they know from experience which species can handle first contact and which cannot. They probably freaked out and inadvertently hurt many species with contact before they learned the lesson not to interfere until folks are ready for it.
</p>

<p>
	Non-interference is an important aspect of consciousness and love. You don't stick your nose where it don't belong. You don't got derailing the developmental paths of others without good reason.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same reason why God does not do stunts to show itself to people. God has a non-interference policy. The nature of a good being is that it will not force itself upon you because it is conscious that this would hurt you and backfire in the grand scheme of things.
</p>

<p>
	Even us 21st century humans try to keep isolated native tribes free from outside interference.

<p>
	You can take that position if you want, but that's not how I teach. I teach practical methods for ordinary people.
</p>

<p>
	Neo-Advaita leaves out everyone who isn't lucky enough to get enlightened through doing nothing. Which is 99.999999% of the population.
</p>

<p>
	By trying to not leave out some people, you end up leaving out all of them.
</p>

<p>
	Telling an ordinary person to do nothing will never awaken them. And even if they get very lucky and do awaken, their awakening will be so weak that I don't even want to call it awakening.

			In the meditation your pointings are very Neo-advaitan.

<p>
	That's basically the do-nothing technique. It's a good technique. But you won't reach the highest levels of consciousness with it. Not unless you're supernaturally gifted from birth with special brain chemistry.
</p>

<p>
	The present moment is not all there is. You need to change your state of consciousness. Your present state of consciousness NOT God-consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Your state of consciousness is absolutely crucial.

<p>
	The opposite is the case. THEY create an elite club of 1 in million people who got enlightened through sheer good fortune, and they expect that same good fortune to carry over to everyone else.

<p>
	Well, good luck with that. You'll need it.

<p>
	My approach is far more non-elitist. Any fool can stick 5-MeO-DMT up his ass and experience awakening. You don't even have to sit through my satsangs or kiss my ass.

		<p>
			But how can you say that antidepressants are worse than placebo when they have been proven to be statistically significantly effective in many studies?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	1) My claim that they were worse than placebo had more to do with their negative side-effects, not their lack of positive effects. My point was that in the NET they are not worth it. I do think they produce some positive side-effects that you will not get with mere placebo since they alter brain chemistry similar to a psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	2) There are many conflicting studies because this is a complex issue. Some studies show that stuff like exercise and other basic practices are as effective if not more effective than anti-depressants. But also, people react to anti-depressants very differently, so it is a great mistake to speak of these drugs in the aggregate, The only thing that ultimately matters is how they affect you personally. For some people it will be helpful and for others it will not. The problem is that these studies do not look at individuals but aggregate data.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, I don't think anti-depressants will solve any fundamental problem. The vast majority of people who take anti-depressants do so because they are clueless of their true effects and because they have no idea that their depression is caused by other root factors which anti-depressants will not correct, only making things worse. And doctors mainly prescribe them because they have no idea of how human psychology or consciousness works and they are corrupted by Big Pharma money. The whole thing is a fucking disaster and a tragedy of ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Also take into account that many of these studies are corrupted by Big Pharma money and agendas, so they cannot be taken at face value. And they do not properly account for negative side-effects or alternative holistic treatments.
</p>

<p>
	It's definitely not that. No human technology is remotely capable of what UFOs are reported to do.
</p>

<p>
	Occam's Razor is that they are simply ETs. Super-plausible given how many planets exist out there.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are rather stupid to expect ETs to just land on the White House lawn. They would never do that. No intelligent beings would so disturb the development path of entire species in such a way.
</p>

<p>
	And if they were hostile, they would have already easily killed us.
</p>

<p>
	So if ETs are flying around us, they will be highly intelligent and highly benevolent.

<p>
	This is context-dependent and relativistic.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, cause and effect is a dualistic notion. From the absolute perspective cause & effect chains are infinite.
</p>

<p>
	But that is a misleading conflation of the absolute and relative domains. When a student asks a Neo-Advaitan teacher about what he can do to become enlightened, saying, "There's nothing you can do because you're already enlightened and cause & effect does not exist" is a foolish answer because obviously the student's question is coming from the relative domain. In the relative domain there is much you can do, like stick some 5-MeO-DMT up your ass.
</p>

<p>
	In the absolute sense you can argue that sticking 5-MeO-DMT up your ass does not cause enlightenment because cause and effect aren't real. But the simple fact remains: if a student sticks enough 5-MeO-DMT up his ass, he will get enlightenment. It's simple, practical, and scientific. No BS games.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between any two things unless you imagine it.
</p>

<p>
	Even to distinguish infinite and finite is an imaginary difference.

<title>In which way do Jim Newman/Tony Parsons and Rupert Spira talk about the same thing?</title>

<p>
	There is no contradiction in saying that you can and that you cannot bring about enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	It works just like fishing. Can you bring about a fish from a lake? Not directly. You cannot ever know when the fish will bite.
</p>

<p>
	But you would be a total fool to take that to mean that there is no skill to fishing. The difference in how much fish a skilled fisherman will catch vs one who is just randomly throwing hooks in the water is about 10,000%
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, the Neo-Advaitan claim is just strictly false because I can consistently bring about enlightenment via 5-MeO-DMT in 15 minutes every single time, any time I want. So the idea that nothing can be done to bring about enlightenment is simply false. Furthermore, the idea that ego cannot take action that will bring about enlightenment is also simply false. You can easily disprove both these claims for yourself with psychedelics. And of course it doesn't stop with psychedelics. You can also do it with meditation, concentration, yoga, visualization, prayer, mantras, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that spiritual practices do not bring about awakening is just absurd and counter to common sense because spiritual techniques would not exists unless they were effective for some people.
</p>

<p>
	And the greatest absurdity of the entire Neo-Advaitan position is the most canonical enlightenment of all time: The Buddha. The Buddha used his ego to generate his enlightenment by forcing himself to sit under the fucking tree.
</p>

<p>
	So the next time a Neo-Advaitan tells you it's impossible to create enlightenment, tell them: But what about the Buddha? And then watch them begin their mental gymnastics.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that the Buddha would have become enlightened without doing his 7 years of hardcore practice is laughable.
</p>

<p>
	Ego plays a crucial role in bootstrapping enlightenment. Without the proper ego, there will be no enlightenment.
</p>

	We pose zero danger to them.

<p>
	I would assume they look after our nukes out of compassion and love -- to make sure we don't kill ourselves. But they must do so in a light-handed way, so as not to interfere with our development.

	Like, maybe if an accidental nuke is launched, they might zap it and we would chalk it up to mechanical failure.

	I doubt Joe will be up for it in 2024. He's getting too old. I think there might be a push for someone young and more progressive.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see Kamala being president. She didn't get enough interest in the primaries and dropped out real early. She will definitely try to run for president again, but I doubt she will succeed. There will be more interesting choices in 2024 and she likely won't excite enough people. But I think she's a good VP pick for Joe.

<p>
	A) Because US culture is dominant online and around the world. If a UFO was seen in Russia, Peru, or India, you would never hear about it in western mainstream culture.
</p>

<p>
	B) I think there might be a connection between UFOs and nuclear launch facilities. Which might explain why they became so popular in the 1950's and 60's, and in the US. If UFOs are real, then they would probably have a special interest in military installations and weapon systems. Which might explain why there are so many military-related sightings.

<p>
	You've choose a mission which is a bit like: I want to teach people how to ice skate uphill.
</p>

<p>
	It would be wiser to focus your teachings and services on those people who are actually suited to it.
</p>

<p>
	An important aspect of the life purpose course is articulating your strengths and playing up to them. Design your LP around your strengths, not your weakness.
</p>

<p>
	Also consider this very important distinction: teaching people how to sing is not the same thing as being a great singer yourself. You might be a bad singer but a great teacher. So clarify what you really want: do you want to be a singer or a teacher?
</p>

<p>
	Rather than teaching everyone under the sun, teach those who show promise.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe in theory you could teach anyone to sing, but is that really worth the effort? Maybe it is. I dunno. But maybe it isn't.
</p>

<p>
	Just as a comparison, teaching everyone calculus is unnecessary and I would even say harmful, because most people are not suited to it and don't need it. Calculus should only be taught to those who really need it and have a knack for it.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I am interested in both.
</p>

<p>
	You can have an ego-death but still not be conscious of God.
</p>

<p>
	Usually ego-death comes as the result of high consciousness, but that doesn't mean it is the highest level of consciousness. There is much to become conscious of beyond ego-death.
</p>

	It seems to be a lot easier to reach ego-death than consciousness of God. And then there are many degrees of depth of God consciousness. The first few levels are pretty shallow. It takes many awakenings to get to the really deep levels, where you finally start to understand what God is, why it is, how it is, what it's doing, what it wants, etc.

<p>
	The limited stages come from when you're not conscious enough to be in the ultimate stage.
</p>

<p>
	Polarization of light is the best analogy. The purest form of light is pure white, which contains all the others. The other colors are what happens when white light gets de-unified. If you re-unify all the light in the world, you will just be left with pure white (which contains all the rest within its whiteness).

<p>
	Those hot girls are just using Instagram to get money and ego validation. They're not gonna sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	Go talk to real girls, not Instagram cock-teases.

	I was in Orange County a few weeks ago. Most folks were wearing masks.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that the internet exaggerates lunatic voices, making them seem more popular than they really are.

<p>
	Yeah, but 200,000 Americans have died, and probably double that will die in the next year. And the damage to the economy is worse than a nuclear terrorist attack.
</p>

<p>
	And at least half of it was easily preventable if not for Trump and his supporters making a culture war out of wearing masks.

<p>
	Highly doubt Trump would actually do it. His word means nothing. It would be huge risk for him. 3 hours of unscripted talking, Trump would say some stupid things he shouldn't be saying if he wants to get re-elected.

<p>
	How it looks is relative.
</p>

<p>
	It looks however you imagine it looks. Which is not to say your image is wrong, but also don't hold it as the one exclusive way it is.
</p>

<p>
	God can be cognized and imaged in a million different ways, all partially valid.
