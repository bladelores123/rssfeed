<p>
	If an ordinary person off the street was shown enlightenment for 5 minutes, he would think he went insane.
</p>

<p>
	It's a very radical shift in perspective.

	Buddha-mind is the Absolute. The Ox is Brahman. Atman = Brahman. Form is formlessness. Formlessness is form. Everything = Nothing = God = Self = Consciousness = Love = Infinity = Oneness

<title>Experiencing the ego death - timeframe</title>

<p>
	This is like asking how long it takes to become a millionaire. It all depends on how bad you want it and how hard you're willing to work for it, and how effectitive your chosen methods are.
</p>

<p>
	Most people will not become a millionaire ever. Because it isn't simply a function of time. To think of it as a function of time is very mistaken and will in itself ensure you waste years in fruitless practices.
</p>

<p>
	Your practice must be serious, genuine, and powerful. Otherwise you will easily waste 20 years meditating without ego death.
</p>

<p>
	They are not different enlightenments but one and the same.
</p>

<p>
	"Soul" refers to a subtle aspect of the individualized self. That too is eventually transcended into pure nonduality regardless of which path you take. "Soul" is a technical term. It refers to subtle states of consciousness. Nondual is beyond even that.
</p>

<p>
	Transcendence goes:
</p>

<p>
	Gross >> Subtle >> Causal >> Nondual
</p>

<p>
	Sounds groovey.
</p>

<p>
	You can (and should) be working toward a permanent nondual awareness. That is the point of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga can help with developing that.

<title>How To Find Your True Motives?</title>

<p>
	A lot of time by your self contemplating and journaling is necessary. And not just once. You must do it over and over again throughout your life.
</p>

<p>
	The LP Course covers this topic a lot.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is the social conditioning and childhood survival habits run extremely deep. It is hard to seperate them out from your genuine higher self motives and values.
</p>

<p>
	I am still discovering more authentic motives in myself after years of self-reflection and years of satisfying various needs.
</p>

<p>
	As you grow your motives will get purified more and more until they run clear like a bitter cold high mountain stream.
</p>

	I know very little about him, but I'd guess he's an outlier and won't fit well on the model. People with mental illness will usually be outliers and their behaviors and motivations would best be explained by studying abnormal psychology (which I rarely study).

</p>

<p>
	Everything must include nothing otherwise it would be less than everything, since nothing would be excluded.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to phrase it:
</p>

<p>
	Without including nothing, everything is incomplete.

<p>
	In the end, I can't see technological advancement as anything but part of God's plan. You can never put technology back in the bottle. Reality is always evolving into higher and higher levels of complexity and integration. Communication technology -- for all of its evils -- is helping integrate the world.
</p>

<p>
	Evil and division win in the short term, integration and love win in the long term.
</p>

<p>
	The internet makes it easier than ever to learn about self-help, consciousness, and enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	As we become more integrated, war becomes less and less a viable solution to our problems. But of course new kinds of problems always arise. Maybe now it will be information warfare more than physical warfare.

	Then why entitle your thread "It can't be said you're God/Reality/Consciousness"?
</p>

<p>
	Rather silly to say so when you are in fact that. So there's no problem saying it.

</p>

<p>
	You might want to try some easier psychedelics first like mushrooms or LSD and work your way up.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging toad venom is not gonna work. Toad venom must be smoked.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is preferable to smoking for newbies. But you'd need to find a synthetic version of 5-MeO for that.

<p>
	Living in this dreamscape is all about striking a healthy balance.
</p>

<p>
	Being an Elon Musk workaholic is to be out of balance in a pathological way.
</p>

<p>
	Allowing unfettered carbon emissions is to be out of balance in a pathological way.
</p>

<p>
	Pragmatically you are being given guidance on how to maximize your consciousness, whether as an individual or collectively. It's hard to enlighten people when their houses are flooded and their children's brains are polluted with toxins.

<p>
	There's no magic pill. You must slowly build one good habit at a time.
</p>

<p>
	By trying to solve everything at once you end up not solving anything. Significant change takes months and years of work. You must build healthy, sustainable infrastructure in your life.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe start by moving to a healthier environment. Then build up from there.
</p>

<p>
	If you try to change too much too fast you'll just experience a terrible ego backlash. It takes time and patience to rewire the brain in a sustainable way.

<title>Language and no mind</title>

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	You do not need to think to understand language. The mind handles that automatically already.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you could be in a conversation with someone, speaking to them, while simultaneously meditating.
</p>

<p>
	Even speaking does not usually require thought.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking is far less necessary than most people think.

The techniques are quite different, although they both lead to the same place.
</p>

<p>
	I find Isha Kriya to be less potent. I assume this is by design. Sadhguru's teachings are very mainstream and he probably does not want to freak noobs out and get himself into hot water.
</p>

<p>
	I assume Sadhguru reserves his most powerful techniques for advanced students. He doesn't give it to noobs to reduce complications.

<p>
	It isn't. Consciousness is everywhere. But for the sense of you to exist, you've tricked yourself into thinking it is planted in that body. Without an ego consciousness would not feel planted in that body.

	 You ARE everyone and everything. But you believe you are not, so it feels to you like you are separate.

<p>
	Imagine a hard drive with many virtual partitions. It is always one hard drive but the virtual partitions help to create temporary sub-domains within the drive, which can be useful. The key is to always remember that the partitions are not real but imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness subdivides itself through imagination, because in truth there is only unity. Division can only happen through imagination. Kind of like how a hard drive cannot physically cut itself into separate parts, but it can partition itself virtually.

I have said it many times already very plainly: there is only one thing in existence: consciousness. The entire universe is one mind.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic and see for yourself that this is true.
</p>

<p>
	But you have to stop thinking of mind as happening inside a brain. Rather, the brain is happening inside a mind. The conventional definition of mind must be expanded.
</p>

<p>
	To say that consciousness is all that exists is identical to saying the universe is one giant mind, the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be two substances to reality because you'd need a third substance to seperate the first two, and so on ad infinitum. The substance is always ONE, regardless of what you choose to call it: awareness, consciousness, God, energy, etc. If your picture of reality has more than one substance, it is dualistic and wrong.

There is no you! The you who thinks it is reading this sentence does not exist. You are a fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is happening without you. The idea of "a you" is being attached to that reality to create the illusion that it is happening to "a you".
</p>

<p>
	For a minute right now, try to totally eliminate any sense that reality is here for you, or is in any way related to your body. Eliminate the sense of yourself entiry. Look at the room you're in an imagine you were never born, but the room still exists exactly as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Eliminate every ounce of you-ness from experience. If you are still saying the words, "me", "I", or "my" you still aren't getting it. Those words refer to nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Or just take a psychedelic and it will be so obvious. Stop wasting time on ineffective methods. Psychedelics answer all questions.

	There are no sides. There are scientific projections which predict 1-10 ft of sea level rise which will leave millions homeless, or there is propaganda paid for by corporations with vested interest in denying such studies.

</p>

<p>
	The situation is simple: Either there is Truth or there isn't. If there is Truth you want to know what this Truth is. Pursue the Truth regardless of whatever. Truth is Truth is Truth. If knowing the Truth is wrong then you shouldn't want continue living.
</p>

<p>
	Let nothing stand in the way between you and Truth. Period.
</p>

<p>
	Truth can only be found if it occupies #1 priority in your heart.
</p>

<p>
	What use if family if it means giving up Truth? Can you see that without Truth nothing else matters? Nothing matters if you cannot distinguish it from falsehood.

<p>
	A) Spirituality is full of traps no matter how you slice it.
</p>

<p>
	B) This problem is solved through studying diverse sources and having maps like the Zen ox-herding pictures and Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	The greater danger with the way you are presenting enlightenment -- as total mastery -- is that people will always fall short of the fantasy, including yourself. Which then produces guilt and suffering. What you are really talking about is totally emotional mastery, and that is VERY different than enlightenment. It is significantly harder and a lot of people can become very frustrated chasing that.
</p>

<p>
	This sort of all-or-nothing approach is counter-productive and fills newbies with fantastical ideas of becoming perfect human beings after awakening. The fact is, you will awaken long before you become a perfect human being. Because these are independent variables.
</p>

<p>
	By all means pursue mastery. But make a distinction between it and awakening.
</p>

<p>
	If your definition of enlightenment excludes Ramana Maharshi, Shinzen Young, Osho, etc. you might want to rethink your definition.
</p>

<p>
	Firstly, many gurus are not at stage Yellow integral cognitive development.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, it is against the guru's business and marketing self-agenda to expose you to 100s of diverse sources. It is in his business interest to create a captive audience, a monopoly.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, exposure to 100s of diverse sources was almost impossible before the internet age. Be careful not to take this for granted. These days you guys are spoiled rotten with 100s of sources.

These are two very distinct things. By making this conflation, as you say, no one is enlightened, because your definition of enlightenment has become an idealistic fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	There are many lines and stages of human development alongside many states and degrees of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality can be grasped at many depths, it has multiple facets, and the realization of all those insights will not automatically make you a perfect human being.
</p>

<p>
	The way we use the terms enlightenment/awakening on this forum is to mean: the realization of no-self, God, Infinity, or Absolute Oneness. That life is a dream. This can happen and you can still have all sorts of fetters, bad behaviors, and psychological stuff. In fact, that's almost guaranteed.
</p>

<p>
	We do not use the word enlightenment to mean, "The total purifcation of karma and mind", or total mastery.
</p>

<p>
	Total mastery is a pipedream for most people and will take you 30+ years of industrial-grade practice.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment occurs when one catches the Ox. Not at picture #10.
</p>

<p>
	This is why the ox-herding pictures and Spiral Dynamics are so useful.

<p>
	The solution to emotions is to observe them mindfully. But of course this takes years of practice.
</p>

<p>
	There are also emotions of the higher self which pull you up to spiritual pursuits. But they are often drowned out by negative emotions like fear, anger, envy, greed, lust, etc.

	The distinction between self/other is a concept, and it will collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Leaving only one thing: YOU!
</p>

<p>
	Your mother is a concept. In fact, she is actually you. You came out of your own vagina.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this freaky to realize. It can feel like you're all alone. That's right! God is all alone. But do not confuse this with solipsism.

</p>

<p>
	But "feeling better" is not a good measurement. Rather, how conscious are you of how your emotions manipulate you.

<p>
	At good way to view emotions:
</p>

<p>
	Emotions are self-manipulations to maintain the self's survival agenda.

	Part of the problem with Green is getting lost in relativity: "everything's relative so anything goes. Let's let criminals run loose and do whatever they want."
</p>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	All POVs have some partial truth, BUT not all POV are equally functional. Some POVs are really pathological, dangerous, and limiting to upward mobility on the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a more evolved and healthier POV than Orange, but Green still has its limits and problems.
</p>

<p>
	Your Orange friend is slightly more deluded than you. And it can be useful to point out his delusion to him.

<p>
	Remember that people below stage Green don't have much concern for environmental issues because their mind is preoccupied with more selfish things.
</p>

<p>
	So the root solution to climate change is to raise more people to Green cognitive development. Then, from that, the rest of the external solutions will follow.
</p>

<p>
	A Green populace will vote for green politicians and green energy.
</p>

<p>
	Climate change is really a problem of excessive Orange. As we can clearly see with Trump, who is in such denial about it.

<p>
	Let's start a list of the best music for listening to on psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously taste in music is very subjective, but try to post the best of the best here. This music should work well with psychedelics and tripping. Chill, moody, down-tempo, ambient, techno type stuff.
</p>

<p>
	There's lots of obscure psychedelic & chillout music that can be found on SoundCloud.
</p>

	Psychedelics will cause bad trips. This is guaranteed if you do them enough times.
</p>

<p>
	The key is it doesn't matter. A "bad trip" is just part of the growth process.

			The reason I say this is because of the "Dark night of the soul" thing. People talk about going through this stage for years. I can't do that. I've read about enlightenment a lot and almost everyone goes through years of hell to finally reach it and then a couple of years later go back to hell. I've already seen too much to go back, so what am I gonna do? live through this dark period until I give up on everything in my ego, including my loved ones?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The Dark Night does not usually last for years. That is rare. Many people don't even get a Dark Night.
</p>

<p>
	When the Dark Night lasts a long time that is for people who have no theoretical foundation, no good guidance.
</p>

<p>
	By watching my videos and reading the books you should be able to avoid all that.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Giving up your loved ones will be necessary regardless. All loved ones come and go. They do not last forever. Enlightenment requires you to surrender everything, but after that you come back and can appreciate it that much more.
</p>

<p>
	Detachment -- counter-intuitively -- heightens your capacity to love.

</p>

<p>
	Rules are important for a society to function, but also rules must be well selected and you must understand why the rule was created.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between following rules consciously vs unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
	And rules in society are much more appropirate than a rule-based personal morality. Your personal morality should not be rule-based but heart and consciousness centered.

A tiny taste.
</p>

<p>
	You only skimmed the surface of the ocean that is psychedelia.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation will come naturally at deeper levels. You have to distinguish between contemplation which is artificial and contemplation which is organic. At higher doses you will be hit with organic contemplations without any need of writing down lists of questions.
</p>

<p>
	What's most important is just genuine curiosity about reality, not a list of questions. The list of questions is good to make, but you do that BEFORE the trip, and you don't look at it during the trip.

You gotta meet the person where they are at.
</p>

<p>
	Telling normies things like, "Nothing is real!" or "Who is saying that?" is just not skillful.

			I agree with what you are pointing towards. The true self is all of reality, as it is right now. 
		</p>

		<p>
			OK Leo, but what do you mean by "creature" here? The idea that there exist external biological organisms which are centers for conscious experience is a concept which I cannot prove. You, Leo Gura, are appearing in my consciousness as a creature but I do not know that you are actually another conscious being. I am Leo Gura but I do not know if Leo Gura is conscious. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The falsehood of solipsism is a practical truth but when aiming for Enlightenment we want the person to stop conceptualising and abstracting all together. 
		</p>

		<p>
			To even say a statement like "you'll live forever" is extremely fuzzy verbal territory to root in actuality because implicit to that statement is notions of time when time is an illusion.

<p>
	It does not make sense to you because you are not awake.
</p>

<p>
	If you woke up you'd immediately know that you are all creatures (and non-creatures) in the universe. This is not a theory or a conceptualization. It is the Absolute. But only if you awaken.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to become every creature to know this, you just need to wake up to what you are. To wake up is to become the entire universe and all objects in it.
</p>

<p>
	At the moment of awakening you realize that you will reincarnate infinitely, forever. Because you cannot die. This means the big Self, not the ego. The ego was a fiction to begin with. It never was. But the big Self takes on infinite forms.
</p>

<p>
	There are many good scientific articles.
</p>

<p>
	Science, by its very nature, is a collective consensus-building activity. So if you're gonna use science at all -- and what other choice do you have? -- you're gonna have to accept a lot of stuff as expert hearsay.
</p>

<p>
	So in this example you were just being too dismissive and smartassy.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, stage Green & Turquoise must build on top of stage Orange rather than excluding and denying it.
</p>

<p>
	Science denial is not a tenable position. What you can do instead is talk about various ways to interpret the science, various ways to recontextualize empirical data.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	But the root source causing the shyness is falsehood. You are shy because you have fear. And all fear is falsehood.
</p>

<p>
	Uncovering why you are fearful in social situations will ultimately eliminate the shyness.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is overcome by understanding what it is you fear, why you fear it, and facing that fear.

<p>
	This is a very poor framing of the situation.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I convinced myself that my learning mathematics would hurt everyone I care about.

<p>
	Enlightenment makes you more capable of helping, loving, and healing everyone you care about. This is the proper framing.

<p>
	A) That video is only one perspective, not the absolute truth. It showcases one facet of a complex issue.
</p>

<p>
	B) That video was primarily about language, but questioning, understanding, and insight goes way deeper than symbols and language.

	It's a quality problem to have.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually you'll probably get so over-stuffed with self-help theory that you will need to detox from it.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually, to deeply awaken, you'll have to let go of the desire for hoarding theory. But right now you might still be at the point where more theory is helpful to you. You'll have to play it by ear.

<p>
	I'm seeing a lot of misunderstanding going on here.
</p>

<p>
	Watch your projections and assumptions about enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is simply consciousness of the Absolute Truth. No particular behaviors or lifestyle correspond with this. Behaviors and lifestyles can vary greatly.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to be deeply enlightened be still be manipulative, abusive, addicted to things, etc.

<p>
	Reality is not like how materialists think it is: an external static object. Rather it is a dynamic mindscape. How you use your mind makes an enormous difference in how you experience reality.

<p>
	Of course you should try to maintain as high a consciousness state as much as you can.
</p>

<p>
	This is transformation, this is growth. You will change and people around you will start to notice it and they will usually not like it because they expect you to be the old self. Become your new self anyways. Change requires the old dying to the new.
</p>

<p>
	A metamorphosis must happen. You are the caterpillar turning into the butterfly. Other caterpillars will not understand your new butterfly form until they do it themselves.

</p>

<p>
	In a high state of consciousness you will not be criticizing anyone. In the same way that you will not be doing violence in a state of high consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	This does not mean people aren't being dangerous fools. There are plenty of dangerous fools in the world. But criticizing fools is itself a delusion because fools cannot help being fools. The more proper attitude is to have compassion and understanding of their state of ignorance.

A normal human cannot focus like that without rigorous training.
