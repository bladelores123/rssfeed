<p>
	Well sure. It's not like Ken has a monopoly on this stuff.
</p>

<p>
	But as a general rule of thumb, I would never trust a professional academic's level of awakening or metaphysical understanding to be the highest.
</p>

<p>
	The wisest and most conscious people would never be academics. This doesn't mean academics don't have some valuable contributions to make. They do. But their understanding will not be too high or all-encompassing and they will miss very important facets of the big picture.
</p>

<p>
	To understand the highest stages you must look for visionaries and geniuses.
</p>

I was/am very anti-conformist like you. Nothing wrong with that. It's just a part of your personality. It might mean you should be a leader, a boss, a solo artist, or just off doing your own thing. This is great. In this case you will have to build yourself up and lead yourself a lot before others start to follow you.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be afraid to carve your own path in life. Maybe consider starting a business within a field you are passionate or curious about.
</p>

<p>
	A traditional cookie-cutter college major or job is probably not right for you. You need something more custom, more your own.
</p>

<p>
	Autistic is also okay. Just part of your personality type. You just need to find a career/purpose which leverages that.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to pursue truth is via yoga, contemplation, philosophy, self-inquiry, and/or psychedelics. So I would build experience will all the above and see how that feels for you. If you really value truth you should love all that.
</p>

<p>
	Try to think about what kind of career would be most aligned with your personality and the value of truth. It's basically that simple. Don't beat around the bush. Nail your top value.
</p>

<p>
	The core of awakening is being conscious of your true identity as Nothing. If you identify with being a body, mind, some human life, or any form whatsoever -- you ain't awake.
</p>

<p>
	What are you?
</p>

<p>
	If you have to think about it or search for it, you ain't awake. An awake person knows what they are immediately, directly.

	Shinzen teaches a narrow version of his vipasanna/mindfulness system. He does not talk about stages of development.

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics breaks down around Turquoise. Ken Wilber's intergal model works much better at mapping stages above Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you cannot understand anything above Turquoise unless you become very awake and experienced with spiritual practices. Which the creators of Spiral Dynamics are not. So it is above their head.

<p>
	It's a sign that you are moving in the right general direction, but it's unclear when an awakening will come. The awakening may still be far off if you've got a lot of energtic blocks and stuff to work through. That stuff that's coming up needs to be worked through, processed, and ultimately let go of.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you're doing okay. Keep working at it. Let the energy take over you. Act it out for a bit in a safe manner and then it should leave you.
</p>

<p>
	Some sort of intense physical activity should good for acting out the energy, like boucing around on a trampolene, etc. I think the key here is to act it out rather than trying to bottle it up. So if you feel like speaking in tongues, or flailing your arms, or yelling, do it. Lock yourself in a room with a punching bag and let it all out. Do so safely.
</p>

<p>
	You need to immerse yourself more in the field and do a lot more research. As you do lots of research you will naturally start having new ideas, you will start seeing unfilled opportunities. It's very hard tobsee these opportunities without immersing yourself and lots of diverse source material.
</p>

<p>
	The secret to creativity is lots of diverse source material.
</p>

<p>
	You say you want to run seminars, but how many seminars have you attended yourself? If you attend 20 seminars I can guarantee you will have some good ideas about how to create some new kind of seminar.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you are stuck is because you lack relevant experience. So go get more experience.

<p>
	Sounds like he is afraid of commitment.
</p>

<p>
	See, a lot of men fear commitment. Men value freedom. Then as they get entangled in a relationship it feels to us like we are losing our freedom and we get doubts. That is very common in men.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like he is not mature enough to be in the kind of serious intimate relationship you want. Trying to change him will be like pulling teeth and will probably end in disaster in the end.
</p>

<p>
	You need to get better at screening guys. Is the guy aligned with your values and what you want? Trying to tame a player is not going to end well for you.
</p>

<p>
	Look for men who are more emotionally mature. Players are usually not.

After a deep trip that after-glow can last for as long as a week or two. Then usually comes a crash back to duality. So wait and see how things go.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you crash, there was still growth, so don't fret too much over it. Keep doing the work. There's always more to become conscious of.

</p>

<p>
	Do not forget that a position of agnosticism, indecision, or doubt is STILL a position, so be very careful that you don't hold it as true or absolute.
</p>

<p>
	What remains after you have doubted everything, including your doubt? Take a look.
</p>

<p>
	Have some hope that your situation is not hopeless. Genuine understanding is possible.

<p>
	That is not going to happen.
</p>

<p>
	It wouldn't be real progress if it could be falsified so easily.

<p>
	That is like saying, if I learn math while on birth control, after I go off birth control will the math still work?

	Puts stuff into words is part of the larger process of realizing it can't be put into words.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's right, you lack a reference experience for what the label "Absolute Love" is pointing to.
</p>

<p>
	That is okay. I only discovered this reference experience a few years ago at around age 31.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot be gotten in your current state of consciousness. You need a radical change in state. Psychedelics are your best bet.
</p>

<p>
	Next time you trip, set your intention to realize what Absolute Love is. At the beginning of your trip tell yourself, "Okay, now show me Absolute Love! What is Love? I am ready to know." If you set a firm intention and you really want to know, it will be shown to you. Mushrooms, LSD, DMT, 5-MeO, 2C-B, MDMA, etc can all show you this love. But you may have to purify yourself first before it is shown to you. You must be ready to surrender the ego to see it, since it is totally selfless.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to know, it will be shown to you. No doubt about it. It's not a matter of random luck. So keep your intention strong. Put your heart into it.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds to me that you're close to realizing it. A few more deep trips might do the trick.
</p>

			So what you are saying here is that there is no ‘why’ that can be expressed with words? But how can it then be understood as a concept? Can this question be answered verbally? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, it can definitely be expressed with words -- but -- those words will ring hollow to anyone who hasn't had the direct realization. Words only have meaning to you when they have a corresponding reference experience. The word "apple" means nothing to you unless you've tasted an actual apple first. Then the word becomes useful. So it's like I'm talking about apples to you but you've never even seen an apple. So to you the word is empty.
</p>

<p>
	It CAN be understood as a concept, but the concept of it is not the thing itself. I have explained the purpose of ego and life many times in my videos as a concept. But what good does it do you? Not much, because you need to discover the truth of what I say for yourself. Then my words will have some significance to you.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it can be answered verbally, but it's weak compared to the non-verbal realization. Here's your verbal answer:
</p>

<p>
	What is the purpose of ego? Survival
</p>

<p>
	What is the purpose of life? To experience yourself as God
</p>

<p>
	Why does anything exist at all? Absolute Infinity
</p>

<p>
	Remember that words are pointers. Pointers to direct experiences. So you must discover what the pointers are pointing to.
</p>

How can I understand deeper what and how Yellow emotional operation system works?
		</p>

		<p>
			How one can examine his emotional stage of development? I mean, I thought that Green and Orange are feeling the same emotions but for different reasons.
		</p>

		<p>
			Of course, we can distinguish, for example, Green from others by presence of such emotions like empathy and love to himself, but at the same time I think Orange also can feel the same but for another reasons and through another “medium”. While Green can hug and cry with you, Orange will pitch you to his boss or take you to the bar. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Is what you talking about when saying “emotional development” are differences in the ways of expression?
		</p>

		<p>
			Or you talking about emotional awareness and understanding of the most suitable ways of expressing them?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not that Orange or even Red can't feel love or empathy. They can. The issue is the level of sophistication these emotions, the level of self-awareness, their depth, and their extent.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Red and Orange will feel love, but that love will be very limited -- their circle of concern does not extend very far. It only applies to their family, close friends, and their nation. And even so, selfishness will limit that love even within family. Red and Orange will also treat love as "merely an emotion". Their love will not have an existential aspect. Their love will not be universal. They will not understand how deep love goes or the power of love. They will deny that love is an Absolute or a property of the universe. They will value money and sex over love. They will mistake love with sexual desire or material possession. They will be so stuck in their left-brain that they will think that logic is superior to love. Their hearts will be closed. They will not have a "Teotlized heart". Whereas a Green person will understand the importance of love more. The Green person has some opening of the heart. But Green still does not comprehend love as an Absolute. Green still does not understand what love is. Green's love is still not fully universal. Green loves to hate Blue & Orange. Whereas at Turquoise love becomes an Absolute -- finally, it becomes totally universal. Finally the constant judgment and criticism and hatred are purified in the light of consciousness. Love is no longer something you do, it's something you ARE. Now you have a Teotlized heart which embraces all of Creation. At this point, your love is so great you are incapable of seeing evil, enemies, or wrongdoing. All sense of "other" starts to disappear. Everywhere you look you only see your Self, you only see Goodness, you only see Love. Your love becomes not about having or receiving but about giving. You love while simultaneously being detached from the objects of your love. Your capacity to love increases exponentially and the depth of your love goes through the roof. Your love becomes unconstrained by ego.
</p>

<p>
	This is not just about feeling an emotion. This is about changing your entire attitude towards and understanding of reality. As you understand reality deeper (at higher Spiral stages) your emotions will change. How you see the world affects what your emotions are doing because emotions reflect your needs and values. As you move up the Spiral your needs and values change.
</p>

<p>
	Practicing unconditional love is a great way to develop emotionally no matter what stage of the Spiral you're at. You can always love a lot more, a lot deeper. So when it doubt, love more! This one approach can transform your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional development is probably the most important of all developmental lines. Because emotions dictate your whole life. Emotions are more powerful than cognition. Which is why all advertising, marketing, and politics is played at the level of emotion. To get someone to do something you must trigger them emotionally. Logic is cheap.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is a real thing (as real as anything else is). The point is that it's possible to become so conscious that you stop doing it.
</p>

<p>
	Think of suffering like biting your nails. It is real when you're doing it. But you can also stop doing it. The point of consciousness work is to become aware of how and why you're doing dysfunctional unconscious stuff, like getting angry, or judging, or overeating, or suffering. We are making unconscious habits conscious, thereby giving us freedom from doing them automatically.

You need to hit a new state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation, yoga, or psychedelics are needed. The answer is experiential, not verbal or rational.
</p>

<p>
	When you really discover why it all exists, it blows your whole heart open. It takes your breath away. It is a religious conversion experience. It is not even in the same ballpark as a verbal answer.

	There is far more to this work than one enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Neo-Adavaita is dangerously oversimplified. You are never going to master consciousness through something like Neo-advaita.
</p>

<p>
	To master consciousness will take you tens of thousands of hours. Not just 1000. Some of you guys keep not understanding this.

<p>
	A brain happens within consciousness. Consciousness does not happen in a brain.
</p>

<p>
	You are stuck in the materialist paradigm and it will totally block you from enlightenment unless you completely deconstruct it and drop it like a fairytale.

</p>

<p>
	With that said, therapy is still useful. But it won't work for you if you're short on cash. Effective therapy requires lots of sessions and will be very costly.
</p>

<p>
	Session per session psychedelics will grow you 10x to 100x faster than therapy. Talking about psychological matters is nowhere as effective as direct spiritual consciousness. Talk therapy is notoriously slow.

It is a compound thing which includes several components: 1) a raw sensation, 2) an automatic bodily recoil reaction, 3) a conceptual activity of interpretation, assignment of meaning, and judgment, and 4) an emotional reaction.
</p>

<p>
	So what Ramana is referring to is #3 & #4, which are of course conceptual activity which can be stopped. The raw sensation is still there. But once you eliminate #3 & #4, this thing we call pain starts to feel and look very different from pain. The sting of pain is not in the raw sensation but in our conceptual interpretation and emotional reaction to it.
</p>

<p>
	So there's no contradiction between what Ramana says and what I am saying. He's just stating it a bit simplistically and starkly so that you realize the important lesson: your mind plays a huge part in how you experience pain.
</p>

<p>
	Have you ever had an experience of pain so intense you start to enjoy it? If you get really curious about pain as it is happening, the sting of it lessens. In that moment you are experiencing it purely as #1, a raw sensation.
</p>

<p>
	Also notice that most pain is not physical but emotional in nature. When someone breaks your heart, or when you feel sad or lonely, none of that is physical pain. It's conceptually driven. And even if you break your leg, at least half your pain will come from the story you tell yourself about it, "OH MY GOD! Why did this happen to me? When will I be able to walk again? What if my boss fires me? How much is this gonna cost me to fix? How could I have been so foolish? Why can't it just stop?" etc.
</p>

	Yes, videos are in the works. It's just taken me some time to integrate my retreat experiences and figure out how to live life from a higher altitude. I have to change how I do my work. So I'm sorting that out.

But the raw sensations of stuff we commonly call chairs, tables, trees, dogs, cars, etc. is what I call Being/Truth.
</p>

<p>
	When the physical world is stripped of all concept and interpretation what remains is Absolute Being. At that point the world stops being "physical" and it becomes divine and eternal.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, we are saying the same thing.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Always try the direct route first. Sit down and simply ask yourself, "What is my trauma?"
</p>

<p>
	If your intention is genuine and honest, and you are open, your mind should supply you the answers.
</p>

<p>
	If that fails, do it while on a psychedelic and you will almost surely receive your answers. Just be careful what you wish for.
</p>

<p>
	The whole problem with heavily traumatic people is that they are not genuine, honest, or open. They have no intention of facing their trauma. They don't want know the truth because it is too painful. They actively avoid talking or thinking about it. So in such cases therapy or psychedelics are very useful. But even so, if there is no intention at all to honestly introspect, nothing will help. The person has to want to grow.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind usually gives you what you ask of it. Most people don't ask much so they don't get much.
</p>

<p>
	All the answers to your life challenges lie within you. But you must dig them out.
</p>

Awakening will be filtered through the mind and personality no matter how awake you get. Some people are more sentimental and emotional while other people are more autistic, cool, and dispassionate.
</p>

<p>
	One awakened person could emphasize Nothingness in his teaching. Another awakened person could emphasize Love in his teaching. Etc. Which is why an integral approach is so good. You can get the best of all the teachings and teachers.

<p>
	Another way to phrase it is: put your attention on attention itself. What is pure attention devoid of all content?
</p>

<p>
	Try doing that for a bit and see how it feels. Notice it's really hard to keep your attention there. The attention veers off within seconds onto some form. This kind of meditation requires serious concentration ability which most people do not have in today's media-saturated culture.
</p>

<p>
	You need to be able to concentrate so hard you could burn a hole through brick wall with your focus. This is the key to accessing the deepest levels of spirituality.

<p>
	What he's saying has value, especially for newbie and intermediate students.
</p>

<p>
	But at the same time, suffering IS a conceptual activity and it can be transcended or stopped. It is something you are doing and you can stop doing it. This does mean that you stop feeling, just the opposite, you must feel it fully, with total consciousness. That total consciousness is what allows you to experience the suffering as self-constructed activity, at which point it becomes conscious and it ceases to be suffering.
</p>

<p>
	This requires very high levels of consciousness which even most awakened people in the West do not have.
</p>

<p>
	But the most advanced practitioners develop it. Which is how monks can do self-immolation.
</p>

<p>
	So the deconstruction of suffering is not merely marketing. It's just unattainable for most people because this requires super-human levels of consciousness which only the most hardcore practitioners will attain.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is, by trying to end suffering you end up creating suffering. So that's not a good attitude in this work. Trying to always be in a positive state is not going to work well. If you really want to end suffering you must completely stop caring what state you're in, even if you're getting tortured, you have to be okay with that state. It's REALLY hard to be that conscious. But it can be done. Just don't go chasing it.

<p>
	I have not vaped it. Because after I snorted 30mg the trip was so intense it felt traumatizing and physically harmful. So I'm not eager to go any more intense than that.
</p>

<p>
	The intensity I get from plugging is so powerful I don't need any more intensity. And if I did, I could always up the plugged dose.
</p>

<p>
	Properly vaporizing a dose can also be challenging. Vaporizing HCl can be tricky as it burns. It also smells gross and I'm not sure if it's healthy for the lungs.

<p>
	You must understand that people have their own partial perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	Martin has some good ideas, but they are partial. He has never plugged 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	My 5-MeO experiences are different from what Martin describes in his books. People react to these substances in unique ways. I am not against vaping. I've just resonated with the plugging. Sometimes you find something that's so good it is perfect, requiring nothing more. That's where I'm at with plugged 5-MeO. To me, it is perfect. It is just absolutely perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Try various methods and see which you like most. Don't turn this into an ideological battle.

<p>
	Falsehood does not exist. There is only truth.
</p>

<p>
	What you call falsehood is an idea which exists in your mind. You're confused about what it is. You're confusing ideas for reality, which makes falsehood seem like it exists when actually it does not.
</p>

<p>
	I dare you to take your finger and point to one false thing in the world. Notice, it cannot be done. Anything you point to, is true. If it isn't true, it isn't a thing so you cannot point to it.
</p>

<p>
	If you point to a picture of a unicorn thinking that's false, you're wrong. It's true. It's just a drawing of a unicorn. That's what it IS. That's its truth. The mistake is imagining further that this unicorn is supposed to exist as something other than the drawing that it is. See? You get lost in your imagination. That's the whole problem here. Falsehood seems to exist only when your imagination is active. You must imagine falsehood. But even imagination is true. You just need to be aware that it is imagination and not the physical world. People conflate those two very easily because it helps us survive.
</p>

<p>
	Falsehood is like a magic trick. It's a clever illusion. An impossibility that appears to be possible when you're not looking at it closely enough.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to stay conscious that all "other" is really yourself. Even if the other is harsh.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise you're in duality.
</p>

<p>
	So I would practice integrating that experience in a way where you're not separating yourself from whoever/whatever that thing was. Then maybe next time it won't feel so "other" or foreign.
</p>

<p>
	If plugged DMT works similar to plugged 5-MeO, it will be an amazing ROA. My best guess is that plugging DMT is better than vaporizing it. Most people vaporize simply because they have not been shown a better way. And because most DMT is sold as freebase. I'll try out both methods and let you guys know my results.

Ruper spira says that attention only serves as directing consciousness away from consciousness towards an object (breath, thoughts for example), in order for consciousness to be aware of consciousness attention has to stop, and that meditation techniques that require the focus of attention only serve to calm the mind and are only preliminary exercises. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Doesnt this contradict what you said in your self inquiry video that one has to concentrate on pure nothingness? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There's really no contradiction. Just different ways to phrasing the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation techniques which focus attention are very good. I wouldn't besmirch them as merely "preliminary exercises." Self-inquiry is a concentration exercise.
</p>

<p>
	It is also possible to meditate on nothingness. But it's an advanced kind of meditation which is not easy for most people to do because the mind easily clings on to some form. So instead most newbies are taught a technique like: focus on the breath.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to put your attention on Nothingness if you're very conscious. It requires taking your attention off of all form. Basically you're trying to become conscious of formlessness, Shiva, or the Godhead.

<p>
	It's not feasible in the long-term. And the deeper question is, why are you interested in working that much at all since work will never make you happy? It clearly shows that you have your priorities backward.
</p>

<p>
	Work is endless. It's an endless game of chasing one's tail. You want your work to be enjoyable and you want to have lots of spare time for spirituality, personal development, and enjoyment of life.
</p>

<p>
	What you want is not effectiveness or success, but consciousness, joy, peace, and health.
</p>

<p>
	Working long hours should only be done for short periods of time for critical strategic purposes, like if you're launching a new business you might work really hard for a year or two, but only because you'll then have more free time.
</p>

<title>Can one put attention on absolute nothing?</title>

<p>
	Nothingness is prior to mind, space, or anything else.
</p>

<p>
	The answer is "sorta." Attention is put on it through the self-inquiry process. Your mind must become very still and your concentration laser focused.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse this with putting your attention on some idea or concept of nothingness. I am talking about ACTUAL nothingness, not any idea you have. An idea you have of it, is not it, and it will prevent you from accessing it. So be careful. DO NOT TRY TO IMAGINE NOTHINGNESS. That is a giant waste of time. It will not work and you will not even be close.
</p>

<p>
	Or a psychedelic can take you there easily.
</p>

<p>
	It's best not to think of it as "putting my attention of nothingness" but rather, nothingness is what you ARE. You are it. It is your truest nature. So rather than looking for nothingness, look for what you are, your truest nature. When I say "you" I am talking to that nothingness you are.
</p>

<title>Vaporhuasca vs vaporized 5 Meo NN DMT.</title>

<p>
	Sounds like you accessed channeling. Very interesting.
</p>

<p>
	I didn't know that MAOI would affect vaporized DMT. That's kinda odd since it was already active. I guess MAOI just supercharges any substance.
</p>

<p>
	Have you tried plugging DMT salt? That should last 45 mins or more and be smoother than vaping with no MAOI required.
</p>

<p>
	Warning: combining 5-MeO-DMT with MAOI can be lethal. Never do that.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is still extremely powerful. And you can increase the dose to the point of whiting out. So lack of intensity is not a problem.
</p>

<p>
	It's just more gentle and longer-lasting.
</p>

<p>
	That gentleness is very good. You don't want to freak yourself out or overload your system. It's also easier to keep your eyes open.

	Yes, when I was in college I had to work really hard on health to lose 65 pounds. I was really fat my whole life.

<p>
	Starting my first business and quitting my job.
</p>

<p>
	It's basically impossible to become wealthy without learning business, sales, and marketing and being very serious about business. Business does not tolerate bullshit and wishful thinking. You must deliver hard results or you're dead. Most people cannot handle that. It's brutal.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	That's a bad way to frame it.
</p>

<p>
	The whole distinction between conscious and unconscious is bogus. There is only consciousness at various levels.
</p>

<p>
	Trips are super-conscious.
</p>

<p>
	Freud and Jung are not good teachings. They did not understand nonduality. Jung has some redeeeming quilities, but still not good enough for our purposes.

<p>
	What you need is a desire for Truth, radical openmindedness, and brual honesty with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The word faith is confusing to people because they then think that Truth is some kind of wishful thinking belief. It is anything but.

</blockquote>

<p>
	They are one and the same, but they are simultaneously distinct. Just like how a coffee table is located in space, yet it is distinct from space. You can have space without a coffee table. Or space with a coffee table.
</p>

<p>
	Phenomena occur inside the witness (we could say). Phenomena are also identical to the witness. And the witness is also distinct from all phenomena. These are various aspects of nonduality which you will have to realize individually, and also together all at once.
</p>

<p>
	A good order of progression is first to realize the witness as distinct from phenomena. Then to realize that since the witness is nothing and nowhere, it is everywhere and everything, including all phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	Something which is nothing and nowhere is also everything and everywhere. That's what you're missing. The witness is not a point in space, it is omnipresent, sort of like how a vacuum is omnipresent.
</p>

	How can anyone answer that for you? If you're gonna be a badass sage, you gotta figure it out.

<p>
	It will not unfold as you anticipate. There will be many unexpected twists and turns. So be flexible, yet also have a vision, be decisive, be proactive.

	Some stuff you try will work. Some will not.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's general advice for all psychs.
</p>

<p>
	Our goal here is to recognize nonduality in everyday life. You need to realize what perceptions are. You need to experience your room and your body as God. So that when you arr sober still know that form and formlessness are one.
</p>

<p>
	It's SO critical to realize that form and formlessness are identical. Otherwise you're still in duality.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is gonna be a very different experience. Very gentle yet strong and lasting for 60 mins.

</p>

<p>
	Really, it was too powerful. Blasting into outer space is not ideal.
</p>

<p>
	Try plugging 20mg. It will be a very different experience. Make sure you keep your eyes open. It's important that you don't fly off to some other dimension but realize that the Absolute is ordinary life, not some colorful fractal.
</p>

<p>
	Medium dose, eyes open, and contemplate.
</p>

<p>
	Your sensitivity will only increase as you have breakthroughs.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out with mushrooms. They will become much more powerful and 5-MeO-like. Scale back all your dosages for all substances.

</p>

<p>
	Be very careful mixing psychedelics with modafinil. Reports seem to suggest that it's not a good combo. But I have not verified it personally.

<p>
	Yes, LSD is a very powerful tool, not to be taken lightly.

There cannot be true authenticity of psychological wholeness without awakening.

	If you were in Australia you wouldn't ask such silly questions, you'd be too busy enjoying Australia and there wouldn't be a problem.

He has the responsibility to call the ambulance when the situation gets totally out of control. So basically yeah, you should have no other people around you. So living in a big city, it could be a problem. But if you start with a relatively low dose, you will still have some control</span>

		<p>
			<span>Actually, I dont remember screaming at all. I was told that I "fainted" for about a minute or so. So that dose was definitely the end of my bodys capacity to handle the substance. I wasnt in control of screaming or not. I simply dont remember it. For me that minute doesnt even exist. It is as if I had tripped permanently without any gaps.</span>

I filled the syringe with about 1 ml of vinegar and just tried drop after drop. Then it solves as nicely as if you put water on HCl. The solution becomes very clear and has no colour. So I do it directly before administration. But I assume if you let the rest of the liquid evaporate, you can still store the acetate solid form quite nicely. I think the salt forms are best for storage (in the freezer).

	It's wrong in the sense that police show up or neighbors disturb you. You need to trip in a responsible manner. If you start running around the street naked, that's no good, even if it feels natural to you while you're high.

			It is only unreal from a very specific viewpoint, which is of the neophyte meditator. There is no such thing as 'asbolute', 'maya' or 'real'. This all sounds very confusing, no? To get people interested in the work, teachers often use bad metaphors and analogies. It's like how they teach you Newtonian physics before quantum. I find this approach to be more confusing than helpful.

	You might as well be asking, "How do we really know that Australia exists? I've only been as far south as Japan."

<p>
	If you really cared to know, you'd buying yourself a 1st class ticket to Australia, not sit around philosophize about it. You can't ever get to Australia through philosophy.

<p>
	As you become more and more successful you will realize how hollow and unsatisfying success is. You will experience depression and disappointment. That will force you to re-evaluate your happiness strategy. Eventually you will have to admit that the only way to become happy is to awaken. And then you will pursue awakening in earnest.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of chasing before we realize that chasing does not work.

	Guys, you must do the work and have your own insights. My answers cannot help you.
</p>

<p>
	Take the things I say as loose orienting pointers.
</p>

<p>
	This is very advanced and tricky stuff. You will have to go through a lot of struggle to ultimately understand it.
</p>

<p>
	Self-deception is always possible. You must always be open to that possibility.
</p>

<p>
	But there is Absolute Truth. You must discover that for yourselves. I have discovered it for myself and that's all that ultimately matters to me.
</p>

<p>
	To doubt the Absolute is itself a self-deception.

<p>
	They didn't look like anything. It was a purely formless understanding. It's just one of the many consequences of nonduality. If you are conscious that everything is nondual, then you realize that you were the dinosuars. Seeing the dinosuars is not necessary to realize this.

From higher levels you will see there are no enemies.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, any stage can have a lapse in awareness. Awareness goes up and down all day long. That's not the issue. The issue is your stage of development.
</p>

<p>
	There are valid criticisms of Green, but you are criticizing Green from below, not above. Seems like you are Blue/Orange.

<title>Sadhguru on 8 types of samadhi states and liberation.</title>

<p>
	Sadhguru says it well.
</p>

<p>
	But it is also possible to preview this Nirvana temporarily -- in case you want to know what it's like without fully exiting this life.
</p>

<p>
	You will dissolve totally into the universe. Then you will return to human form and be able to talk about it. Although it's so nondual there's not much that you can say about it.
</p>

<p>
	It is a total lack of discrimination. The collapse of all distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	Then you can decide whether that's something you really want. This whole liberation business is often framed as "you must do this, this is the highest" but there's also nothing wrong with exploring the formed realm. Don't be in too much of a rush to liberation. Explore the formed realm well first. Then, if you are sick of it, you could consider liberation. Liberation is not better than anything else. Liberation is just the organic end point of doing a lot of exploration of reality to the point where you've explored so much of it that you say, "Okay, I'm good. I've had my fill. Time for peace". Very few people are at this point. Don't rush too much to get to this point, it should be organic.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that life is about the journey, not the destination. Try to enjoy the spiritual journey rather than rushing to some ultimate end-point.
</p>

<p>
	It makes no sense to the ego-mind because the ego-mind is constantly trying to survive. The ego-mind as a mechanism does not allow you to feel happy other than as a manipulation or a reward for survival. So you are like a dog stuck in a cycle of chasing dog biscuits without realizing that there is an endless mountain of dog biscuits right over the hill. But you are so hungry for that one biscuit that you never go over the hill to dog heaven <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Motivation is a manipulation mechanism that the mind uses over you. Notice how easily you're controlled by the promise of a little pleasure in the future. You are so controlled by it you wouldn't even take infinite happiness if it was offered to you. Because you'd say, "But that would mean I have to stop chasing crumbs." Yes, you'd have to stop chasing crumbs.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you have been offered a billion dollars but you say, "I'm too busy to take this billion dollars because I'm busy chasing millions of dollars." Well, okay, have it your way.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Similarly, why not just pursue enlightenment and say fuck off to the rest of personal development and your life areas (social, career, hobbies, etc) as you will already be happy? Why not just sit down and do nothing every day? Is it that the joy from unconditional happiness great isnt that great of a feeling and other things provide some more upward curves? Does unconditional happiness just move the baseline?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Indeed. That's what an intelligent person would do.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, you can't do it. Because you're too hypnotized and addicted to life.
</p>

<p>
	Are you really willing to sacrifice your entire life for God? If so, do it.
</p>

<p>
	You are totally underestimating what awakening offers. It doesn't just offer happiness. It offers immortality and God-realization. You cannot even fathom such kinds of joy. It is a joy beyond anything you've experienced in your life. The technical terms for it are Bliss, Ecstasy, and Paradise.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a literal Paradise. That's what you're missing by not fully awakening. So what's the catch? The cost of attaining this Paradise is surrendering your entire life. Which is of course out of the question for you.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	See, the problem is, you don't have any reference point for what an Absolute is. You don't even understand that an Absolute is possible. Because all you've experienced in your life are relative things.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute means it is true under all possible circumstances. It was true before the Big Bang happened and it will be true after our universe ends.
</p>

<p>
	An Absolute is not state-dependent, it is not a function of the human mind, it is not an experience, it is not an perception, it is not belief, it is not an assumption, it is not a theory, it is not a thought, it is not an intuition. It is ABSOLUTE!

<p>
	Facing your fears is one of the keys to life.
</p>

<p>
	1-2g of mushrooms in a good setting should be a wonderful thing.
</p>

<p>
	Bad trips come and go. Not such a big deal. You're not going to break your brain with 1-2g of mushrooms. The worst that can happen is you will freak out a bit. But even that is not a big issue on 1-2g. The real mindfuckery begins around 4g.
</p>

<p>
	1g is a very safe starter dose. 2g is pretty awesome but still within the realm of reality. And at 4g reality starts to collapse in really twisted ways.
</p>

<p>
	I remember in my worst trip, at 4g, I realized I was all the dinosaurs who ever lived. That was freaky.
</p>

<p>
	You oversimplify this whole process.
</p>

<p>
	If that worked for you, great. But that it's not going to be that easy for most people. There is much more to this work than just watching the breath. If it was that simple, then spiritual traditions would be that simple and there wouldn't be tens of thousands of pages of Buddhist scripture mapping out various spiritual realizations and other nuances.
</p>

<p>
	No one is saying enlightenment is not one. It is of course one. But there are many degrees and facets to that one. The ocean is one but it has many depths and areas to explore.

			Yeah I really wanted my trips to be contemplative and productive but I get so distracted by the psychology-based insights I keep having. That stuff's productive, sure, but it's still based on form. I struggle with being distracted in my day to day life along with over-theorising, so maybe it's my ego trying to hold on and knowing how to stop me going deeper.
		</p>

<p>
	That's not necessarily wrong. It might just mean that you have some psychological baggage to work through to prepare you for the really deep existential insights which will inevitably come if you keep tripping consistently.
</p>

<p>
	I have a theory that most ordinary people, if they do a bit of psychedelics, will not get deep metaphysical insights because they have a lot of psychological baggage to clear up first. They aren't pure enough, and they aren't existentially curious enough. The psychedelic will show you the answers you NEED and also the answers your heart is seeking. What does your heart want to know? If it doesn't want to know much, then you won't get much.
</p>

<p>
	For me, my heart was always seeking the deepest answers to why reality exists. And so I get those answers very quickly on psychedelics. Because I care about understanding reality so much. It's really my purpose for living. So the psychedelic takes me there almost instantly. It's nuts. You have to really care to know.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really actively contemplate on psychedelics. Most of my contemplation is during everyday life. But that then sort of builds up a deep curiosity which then gets answered in the trip. I don't try to control my trips much. I just sit down and say something to myself like, "Okay, now show me the highest Truth! Whatever it is, I want to know and I will accept it. Lay it on me. What am I still missing? What am I still not understanding about reality?"
</p>

<p>
	Usually that triggers a torrent of profound revelations. Sometimes it can be uncomfortable.
</p>

Play some chill tunes while you drive and enjoy the lights.
</p>

<p>
	That's probably my fave way to integrate. Driving puts me in a great mellow meditative mood. A sort of integrative flow state. Road trips out in nature in the wild are also amazing for this. Do a 3 hour road trip through a mountain, forest, or desert. Those are some of my fondest times.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said before, there are many degrees to awakening and nonduality. Many facets. Very few people are totally awake or understand all the facets and degrees.
</p>

<p>
	"Normal enlightened person" is simply too vague of a term. Some of those people have very shallow levels of realization, and some of them have very deep levels of realization. Lumping all enlightened people into one bucket just isn't accurate and creates misunderstanding, turning enlightenment into a binary, one-dimensional thing when it is not.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying 5-MeO is the best or deepest. I'm just saying it's a very powerful tool which many people are dismissing to their own detriment. I don't want to turn this into a nonduality dick measuring contest. There are just degrees of it.

			A lot of his talk about no free will was inspired by his awakening to no sense of agency state which as far as I know, he is to this day.

			There is a huge difference in experiencing 5-MeO infinity and classic permanent shift to "non-dual" awareness

	Sam Harris is nowhere near awakened. He's had some minor insights into no-self, but that's a far cry from the kind of stuff one realizes on 5-MeO. He still has a massive ego and that damned materialist, rationalist, dualistic attitude. He has not realized God or Infinity or total nonduality, or many others important things.

<p>
	Yes, there is a difference between 5-MeO and a classic shift into non-dual awareness. 5-MeO-DMT is more temporary but more profound and more powerful. It's impermanent precisely because it is so powerful it's almost impossible to function from such a high level of consciousness. You need something more tame and stable for everyday life.

<p>
	Imagine a degree of nondual awareness so high that you couldn't even walk. You would just be writhing around on the floor in astonishment like a flapping fish as your mind connects to universal intelligence and fathoms everything in existence.
