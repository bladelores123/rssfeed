			The biggest challenge is "finding a qualified dentist". I'm not sure how I'm meant to know who's qualified and who isn't. If for instance the dentist at my local clinic is qualified, he's obviously going to think he is. I have no idea though.

So how did you get these toxic metals in your body, was it the food that you were eating or the water you were drinking, I mean were you drinking tap water without filtration?

<p>
	It's impossible to know exactly from where.
</p>

<p>
	It all adds up over your lifetime. Heavy metals can be present in any brand of food or drink and you will probably never know it.
</p>

<p>
	I never drank tap water.
</p>

<p>
	Think of how much food you've eaten over 30 years. Well, each piece of food had some trace amount of heavy metals in it. And it's all added up. It's pointless trying to guess which one place it came from.

<p>
	Western medicine is still in the Dark Ages. You basically can't trust Western doctors about many things.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there are serious risks to getting amalgams removed. It must be done properly by a qualified dentist. Do your research.

</p>

<p>
	If your dentist was using mercury fillings in 2016, you should fire that dentist and maybe even threaten to sue him.

<p>
	There's always gonna be some targeted strikes happening. That's just how American empire operates. And some of that might be necessary. It's not a Democrat or Republican thing.
</p>

<p>
	I don't consider keeping a small contingent of troops in an area a war. The low amount of troops we have now in Iraq or Afghanistan is not a big deal. They could be helping the area from breaking out into a bloodbath. This is a good use of military.
</p>

<p>
	The reason these troops are not pulled out by Dems or Republicans is because the military advisors tell them both that doing so would lead to reckless instability in the region. And that could well be the case.

	For all the shit that progressives talk at the Lincoln Project, their actually philosophy is spot-on.
</p>

<p>
	These guys need to form a sane conservative party because conservatives are not going away. It's simply of question of: will we have sane conservatives or bat-shit crazy ones?
</p>

<p>
	I actually feel bad for sane conservatives because in the era of Trump they have no voice. It's Trump or nothing at all -- and that is no sustainable. It is possible to be a reasonable conservative, but they get no voice.
</p>

<p>
	Progressives make a mistake when they demonize reasonable conservatives like the Lincoln guys and David Frum -- leaving no alternative but bat-shit crazy.

<p>
	Mercury will pass all barriers and enter every organ in your body, including the brain all by itself.
</p>

<p>
	That's already the case for you.
</p>

<p>
	Just detox it out. You can do a heavy metal detox the day of your vaccine so all the mercury will just get peed out.

	Maybe. The only way to solve such issues is to troubleshoot various solutions one by one after doing lots of research. No one will do that work for you. You must do it yourself.

<p>
	Her take probably wouldn't change if she still had that stage Blue/Orange conservative worldview.

<p>
	There are two dynamics at play here:

<p>
	Oil, rare minerals, cheap labor, factories, tourism, farming, etc.
</p>

<p>
	But of course it's a difficult situation. Which is why 3rd world countries tend to stay 3rd world countries.
</p>

<p>
	But look at India. They are a good example of a 3rd world country that might soon develop into something more thanks to their labor and manufacturing potential.
</p>

<p>
	Basically 3rd world countries have to go through industrialization just like 1st world countries did a century ago. You can't really skip the massive industrialization part.

<p>
	If you read Peter's books and the books on my book list, then you should be all set.
</p>

<p>
	I will be adding more books to my list, but most will not be enlightenment related.
</p>

<p>
	There is only so much use you can get out enlightenment books. After you read a dozen, they all become the same. To really go to the next level you must drop the books and turn to psychedelics.

<p>
	Also remember, when it comes to meditation: quality over quantity.
</p>

<p>
	It does little good to meditate 5 hours but it is a sloppy 5 hours of monkey mind. Tighten up your method and reduce your time. You will gain more this way.

<p>

<p>
	It was not doxxing per se. It was a matter of reporting a suicidal person to their parents. Be chill, things are in good order. You guys are way too gossipy around here. Keep your nose to your own business.

<p>
	Just realize this: when you are day trading your job is essentially to steal money from others. Only you don't call it "stealing".
</p>

<p>
	And then you wonder why it doesn't work and why your money gets stolen instead.
</p>

<p>
	When you enter a den of thieves, expect to get robbed. That's called being a fool.

<p>
	That is beyond the scope of what we are talking about. First, get the basic distinction between a belief and direct experience of a thing.
</p>

<p>
	When we talk about direct experience of Mars, we are not implying that it exists forever permanently. That's an additional projection your mind adds to the experience. We are simply talking about the experience. Have you ever experienced Mars for yourself? Yes or no? I don't care if you think it exists without you looking at it. And I don't care if you think it is a hallucination. Those are separate issues.

<p>
	We have a billion dollar right-wing propaganda machine which demonizes Green.

<p>
	Economically Obama is more in the Orange/Green stage. Not even solid Green.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is a demogague. Demogauges gain power by con artisry and appealing to people's fears and anger. Trump pull off the greatest con in American political history thanks to demonization of Green and improper media coverage.

How do you know about it at all? It is just hearsay and belief.
</p>

<p>
	Have you ever seen it? No? Then what else could it be but a belief?
</p>

<p>
	If you ever see it with your own eyes then it will become something more than belief for you.
</p>

<p>
	Buy a telescope and actually try to find Mars and notice the difference between what you find and the belief you had.

<title>Daniel Ingram: Psychedelics, Meditation and enlightenment</title>

<p>
	Well, I think there is more overlap between meditation and psychedelics than decathlon and calculus. But psychedelics require a patient and methodical approach, just like meditation. You can't just jump into it once and understand.
</p>

<p>
	It's good if we get more advanced meditators like Daniel to also go deep into psychedelics because right now these two fields lack integration. We need more mystics and nondual teachers and Buddhists doing serious psychedelics.

	In that thread I said that Russia's level of development could not accommodate much better.
</p>

<p>
	Were it not for Stalin, probably some other strong-man would have taken his place.

<p>
	In general I don't hold the naive view that ousting a "bad guy" will solve much of a country's problems. The bad guy will be replaced by another bad guy.

		<p>
			I may also be a naive Green, but i feel you can't ignore the responsabillity of the commander in chief of a country when it meddles in another countries affairs. I used to think Obama's election was cool. Then Lybia happened, and i started to dislike him a lot. Today, each day i gorw more fond of him, due to better understanding some of his actions and responsibilities.
		</p>

		<p>
			That said, somethings i just can't swallow, and i think Lybia is the best example. Gaddafi did not pose any threat to the US population, only to the interests of some US corporation's who wanted to exploit the continent. And Obama signed the order to bomb the country, effectively destroying it and turning it into to a hub of slave trade.
		</p>

		<p>
			And you dont have to compare him to a school teacher, Trump for example did a much better job (even though i like Obama better) at not destroying other countries.
		</p>

		<p>
			You ask what the alternatives to drone strikes are? i feel like NO drone strikes are a GREAT alternative.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, there are many possible explanations there:
</p>

<p>
	1) There were threats posed by Lybia that needed some action.
</p>

<p>
	2) The military advisors and so on misled Obama
</p>

<p>
	3) Obama could have made a mistake.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to tell without knowing all the details of why they decided to bomb. I don't know all the details of that action and the reasons behind it.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly I acknowledge that Obama could have made some bad choices. But you also have to consider what worse choices someone else in his position could have made. If Trump was in his shoes during that time I don't think he would hesitate much to bomb Lybia. Same for John McCain.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, it's not like Jesus is going to fill the Presidency role. The choice was Obama vs McCain vs Romney.
</p>

If you had a serious issue it would be many times higher, like 30 or 40 instead of 4.7
</p>

<p>
	You must get blood work done for Free T3 and Free T4. These are required to see the true function of your thyroid. TSH is not good enough by itself.
</p>

<p>
	If your T3 and T4 are within range, then TSH is no big deal. But if your T3 and T4 are out of range, you need thyroid hormone pills to bring them back into range.
</p>

<p>
	Any good doctor should immediately test your Free T3 and T4. You can also order these tests online without a doctor.

<p>
	Copper is not a heavy metal per se, but still probably not good in the long-term.
</p>

	I would test out all your options to see which one has least side-effects for you. Girls tend to have different side-effects on different methods and it varies a lot from girl to girl. Only way to know is to test it.

<title>Contemplation vs meditation: I am too addicted to Questioning to meditate</title>

<p>
	Yes, this can be a big problem.
</p>

<p>
	As some point you gotta shut off the contemplation and just sit in silence. This is a crucial skill to develop.
</p>

<p>
	If you're good at contemplating, now you must learn silent concentration. Sit in silence, empty your mind, and rivet your attention on pure awareness/existence/I AMness itself. And just sit like that for as long as possible. With time you will get better at it.
</p>

	Look at all the right-wing political media channels and sources. They are funded by millions and billions to peddle pro-capitalist, pro-libertarian disinformation. Think tanks, lobbyists, grifters like Dave Rubin and Candence Owens, Fox News, Brietbart, OANN, NewsMax, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's all designed to milk money from stage Blue rubes to keep the stage Orange capitalists on power.

<p>
	Obligation is a terrible motivation for doing something.
</p>

<p>
	Forget about cancer and follow your pasison.
</p>

<p>
	The cancer patients will be cured by those who are passionate about cancer.
</p>

<p>
	And once those patients have been cured, they will need good writing, sociology, and politics. What good is curing them if they then become ignorant QAnnoners? Curing the cancer of ignorance is just as important as curing physical cancer.

<p>
	There are two main facets of awakening:
</p>

<p>
	1) Realizing that you are not the human biographical self who imagines it was born and will die. You are the empty awareness which imagines all form.
</p>

<p>
	2) Realizing that the empty awareness (Nothingness) is identical to all form! Thus coming full-circle.
</p>

<p>
	So in the end, you are all of reality. But also you are prior to all forms as Infinite Emptiness. And you are certainly not the biographical human self, which is an illusion. But still, you also are it (temporarily).
</p>

<p>
	You need to have both of the above realizations. They will probably not occur at the same time. Start with realizing #1. Then move on to realizing #2.

	It depends on where you're getting the girl from. If you're getting her from the nightclub, you need to sleep with her that night because the next day she will lose her mood and never call you again.
</p>

<p>
	But if you get her from more day-game and social circle, then you can afford to be much more patient.

	Some people simply have no ambition.
</p>

<p>
	Without ambition you can live a simple life, but you won't achieve anything big. Cause you don't care.
</p>

<p>
	But also, if you really don't care, then what's the problem? Unless you actually do care?
</p>

<p>
	There is no cure for lack of ambition.

<p>
	There are many factors possible here:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		The tone of voice you talk to yourself with
	</li>
	<li>
		How much you judge yourself and criticize yourself
	</li>
	<li>
		How hard you push yourself to achieve goals
	</li>
	<li>
		How strict you are with yourself
	</li>
	<li>
		How little rest you allow yourself to take
	</li>
	<li>
		How you don't allow yourself to have fun or enjoy life
	</li>
	<li>
		etc.
	</li>
</ul>

	They are partially and relatively true. Assuming you're thinking well.
</p>

<p>
	Your thoughts are true from a certain point of view.

<p>
	No it isn't. I've found physical causes.

<p>
	Not all of life's problems are mental. When you have heavy metals in your brain, that ain't mental. And no amount of positive thinking will resolve that problem.

A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.<br />

</blockquote>

<p>
	The reality is much more brutal than merely that.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that the reason rich people are rich is mostly because the whole society is rigged like a pyramid scheme to funnel money upward toward the very top 1% to 10% of society, thus basically enslaving the bottom 90% to be the servants of the top 10%. And then those top 10% are so happy and so powerful that they have zero interest in change the system because it serves them perfectly, and the bottom 90% are too poor and too busy working for the top 10% to do anything about it.
</p>

<p>
	This is how all human civilizations have functioned for some 10,000 years since ancient Egypt. And it continues to this day.

<p>
	It's not simply a matter of what Trump says or tweets. It goes so much deeper than that. There is a billion dollar industry of right-wing propaganda and misinformation that's happening online through social media. Millions are being burned to spread Trump's lies and attacks on the "fake" news media, corrupting the minds of 10s of millions of people, sowing doubt and distrust of scientists, doctors, experts, bureaucrats, politicians, liberals, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This is one of the greatest mass-brainwashings in human history and it's going to have severe negative consequences. And what's worse, Trump ain't done. He's only gearing up his fake news propaganda campaign. He's gonna keep milking it for the rest of his life. It's really tragic how much damage this one man will do to American political discourse. Thousands of people will die needlessly and millions of minds will be corrupted for a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	The damage Trump has done and will continue to do is in a sense worse than Bush's Iraq war. Trump is corrupting the entire epistemic framework of the country. And almost nobody understand how serious that is. Because epistemology is not a big shiny object. It's mostly all subconscious and hidden from sight. At least a war is visible, tangible, and has a beginning and an end, and it can be easily protested. You can't protest cancer of the mind and it lasts a lifetime.

	Nice try, but too little too late.
</p>

<p>
	A local approach is not good enough to handle a serious pandemic. This is precisely why a federal government exists, but people are too attached to their ideological ideas about freedom and states rights. Okay, have your states rights, and 1 million people will die and the economy will lose trillions.
</p>

<p>
	That's what bad governance gets you.
</p>

<p>
	Government is not some silly thing that happens automatically in Washington. Government requires serious attention to detail and serious measures.
</p>

<p>
	If we followed your ideology in WWII, Hitler would have taken over America.
</p>

<p>
	You have to think these things through, not just parrot ideas you heard somewhere. New problems require new ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Containing Covid is too late now. Now we gotta deal with the shitstorm Trump invited. And millions more will die as Trump has brainwashed them not to take the vaccine with all his "fake news". Trust in the media is crucial now, and it has been completely undemined with conspiracy theories and populism. So millions more will die, and trillions more will be lost in the economy. This is precisely what happens when you vote a selfish idiot into a position of enormous responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	Did you think there wouldn't be a price to pay for his absurd levels of selfishness? You think the universe will just let that one slide? You really don't understand spirituality then.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump's way of living and governing has no massive costs, then everything I teach with Actualized.org is wrong and you should stop developing yourself.

<p>
	That strategy can def work if you are pateient enough for it. But many will never agree to come to your house for a first date. Inviting a woman to your house for a first date is a bad move unless you know she really likes you. You will have far more luck doing the most low-investment date, which is a coffee near your house.

There's not much to admire in Lenin. He might have been a bit better than Stalin, but not by much. Socialism in Russia would have never worked, no matrer who was in charge. The development level was not at all ready for it.
</p>

<p>
	There are many people who just believe Marxism is great and will work. Well, that's just not the case. It's great in theory but doesn't fly in practice. But people get ideological about it.
</p>

<p>
	Many Green progressive types are ideoligically stuck on Marxism. They are not truly thinking independently.

<p>
	I sound like a broken record, but psychedelics can fix that pretty quick.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you can be intimate without necessarily dredging up old traumas and things. Not sure why you're so eager to go into that. I mean, she's not your therapist. She doesn't need to know every weakness you had in the past.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like you're trying to build negative intimacy when you could just focus on building positive intimacy.
</p>

<p>
	If everything is awesome now, what's the point of delving back into the past?

</p>

<p>
	I think your problem would simply be solved if you developed a couple new paths forwards weekly socialization. Like a group of friends you hang out with or play games with.
</p>

<p>
	You can find local meet up groups through MeetUp.com
</p>

<p>
	Stop wallowing at home and go meet some people. Action is required here. Then see how you feel.

			I have a question for you: Nowadays I mostly watch your content and Matt Kahn's, I feel like Matt Kahn is the heart and you are the mind, to love you don't need to understand and sometimes I question myself if I should take one approach or the other, since being in my feminine seems to be much easier than understanding all the complexities of the mind, <u>do you think at some point you will be more heart centered as you approach enlightment or your style will still be very rational?</u>
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Actually, Understanding IS Love.
</p>

<p>
	How can you Love when you don't understand what Love is?
</p>

<p>
	Matt's style will resonate a lot more with feminine females than mine will.
</p>

<p>
	My style will evolve. But my bias is towards understanding stuff. Every teacher has his biases. Find what works for you.

<p>
	No only that, but the vaccine will take months and even a year to fully roll out, so you will hear about any side-effects from real-world victims.
</p>

<p>
	There's no way the side-effects will remain secret. It will all happen out in the open. If people die, we'll see it. You won't even have access to the vaccine until millions of other people get it before you.
</p>

<p>
	But the idea that people will be dying from this vaccine is absurd. It's not gonna happen in any significant degree. But people die from Covid something like 1-3%.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality" rel="external nofollow">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality</a>
</p>

<p>
	And Covid has many other harmful effects beyond 1-3% death rate. You could easily lose $10,000 in hospital bills alone!
</p>

<p>
	There's just no comparison. The vaccine is 10000% better. And the sooner people understand this, the sooner our economy can recover.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course there could. But you must weight that against the very well-documented serious side-effects of Covid.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is considering risk in isolation from other risks. The question is always one of the difference between two risks, not any one risk by itself.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps the greatest risk of all is the damage to the economy if we do not stop this virus dead-cold within a year. This will harm billions of people. The economy cannot return to normal without stopping this virus. Pretending like the virus does not exist will not work. We can't just will our way back to normal.

<p>
	There are serious side-effects to owning a stove. So what?
</p>

<p>
	You're using ridiculous logic. A million people will die without a vaccine. This is not speculation. It's already half-way there.
</p>

<p>
	No technology is perfect. But given the mess we are in right now, we don't need anything close to perfect. We just need something better than 1 million deaths and a 10 year depression.
</p>

<p>
	So far the most common side-effect of the Pfizzer vaccine is like 7% of people get fatigue.
</p>

<p>
	Governance is never about perfection, it's about minimizing harm and risk in reasonable ways. AKA, strategy.
</p>

<p>
	Even if the vaccine killed 0.01% of people, it would still be worth taking. But the vaccine will be much much safer than that.

<p>
	Except the problem there is that it's the parents' whose survival needs are being met there while the survival needs of the partners is often being ignored.
</p>

<p>
	You're dealing with 4 competing survival needs there: husband, husband's parents, wife, wife's parents. Which makes for a very loaded political game. It will be difficult for Truth and Love to compete with all those interests.

			The thing is food production and waste has to get REDUCED in rich countries. Then use the machines and fertilizers used there to support local food production in poorer countries. Yet, you can't copy exsisting forms of agriculture 1:1, but have to adjust them to the soil and climate in those countries. One of the problems is that, for example in Africa, countries are distributed on different latitudes and every latitiude can differ quite a lot in climate.

<p>
	This kind of stuff requires higher forms of world government which even America and Europe is not yet ready for.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that you can just treat the whole world as one giant collection of humans and just distribute resources to whoever needs it << we don't live in such a world, not politically. The world is deeply divided and tribal still. Which creates all sorts of inequalities that cannot be easily equalized from one part to another.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Help from outside can work. It just has is limits.
</p>

<p>
	The country has to develop to a higher point on the Spiral, which takes hundreds of years. Any country Orange and below will have crippling poverty. We at least need stage Green. And people love to hate Green these days even in developed countries. Which shows you the depth of our problem.
</p>

<p>
	Poverty is not really a farming or shipping problem, it's a mental development problem. It's a catch-22. You need better access to food to increase mental development. But you need high mental development to create better access to food. So there is a lot of struggle and slippage as the process tries to bootstrap itself.

	I'm not sitting in a cave. I was trying to create a deep romantic relationship. I will create a video about Conscious Relationships in the future. Once you see it, you'll see me in a different light. I just haven't had the time to shoot it yet.

<p>
	That's questionable in a relationship context.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is the ego loves to co-opt spirituality and consciousness for survival. It's a very deceptive and murky process.
</p>

<p>
	Is there something like a genuine connection with another human? Yes. But it is wrapped in layers of survival stuff which will always linger.
</p>

<p>
	But hey, I'm sick of preaching this stuff. Go contemplate how your dating and relationships truly work for yourselves. If you dare.
</p>

<p>
	Consider this: the only reason you guys follow me is because it gives you survival value. As soon as my ability to give you value disappears, you will leave me or hate me. Yet in your minds you don't think of it that way. In your minds you think you really appreciate me for who I am. Of course this is pure fantasy. You don't really care who I am. If I was Hitler, you would want me killed. Such is life. Accept it and move on.

<p>
	All you have to do to see that your romance is completely self-biased and survival based is to contemplate why you don't get romantic with a gorilla. There is absolutely no reason why you should relate with humans more than gorillas other than survival.
</p>

<p>
	Absolutely everything involving sex is pure self-bias. Why do you not hump a light-post? Sex is COMPLETELY arbitrary and relative. And the only reason you do it is because it has survival value for the species.
</p>

<p>
	But don't get me wrong. This doesn't mean you can't have deep intimate relationships. You can! Just stop fooling yourself about what it is you're doing. You are using those relationships to enhance your survival. You are doing that without admitting you are doing it. Self-deception 101.

			You're right but i think labelling relationships as just completely and utterly a big, swirling survival game sort of muddles the water between conscious vs unconscious, healthy vs unhealthy, decent vs indecent relationships. It gives you a free pass to be a dick and view women red pillish. Because hey its all a big toxic ego game anyway right? Being a dick is just survival!

<p>
	Except that's your projection, not anything I said.
</p>

<p>
	Relationships are survival. But saying so does not devalue the relationship in any way. It's just being honest about what you're doing. People get the very wrong idea here that I am anti deep relationships. Not at all. You can do deep intimate relationships with consciousness and spiritual aspects. But it's still a survival game.

<p>
	People love the illusion of it not being a game. It makes the ego feel justified in its raw survival. The ego needs to paint a pretty story about how all of its purely arbitrary survival needs and manipulations are in fact legit, pure, good, honest, truthful, and selfless. Women especially fall into this illusion and they really upset when it is pointed out them.
</p>

<p>
	Both men and women are selfish as devils when it comes to sex. The selfishness is asymmetrical, with each side denying their own particular brand of selfishness while being outraged by the selfishness of the opposite side. And all of this is, of course, just more selfishness! And all of this is, of course, denied with great passion and fury.
</p>

<p>
	It would be much simpler if you just came out and said: "I am a selfish devil and I want sex under conditions X, Y, Z because that's what serves me best." But of course you cannot do that because it harms your survival. Your community will judge you for it and you can't stomach admitting to yourself just how selfish you are. So you must keep all your true motivations and conditions secret, even from yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Careful, not all dicks who mistreat women are PUAs. That's a very problematic conflation.
</p>

<p>
	Ordinary guys mistreat more women than all the PUAs in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Guys with poor dating and poor social skills are not angels. They creep women out big-time.
</p>

<p>
	Let's not pretend that a non-PUA will not manipulate women. He certainly will, just with less skill.

That's like shooting fish in a barrel. The perfect cover to ply your art.
</p>

<p>
	Many people get laid from their jobs, simply by having the right jobs which offer automatic socialization opportunities. And of course they use this to their advantage to snipe the best targets. This is like a socially acceptable form of pickup.

<p>
	That's precisely how ignorance works. An ignorant person feels he has the whole world figured out. Hence the tragedy of it.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I said a conspirscy theory is a dumb person's idea of intelligence. Analogous to how Trump is a poor person's idea of a rich person. They don't know what genuine wealth or strength looks like.

<p>
	You have a naive understanding of how politics works. When you are leading a giant nation, all sorts of evils will happen and mistakes will be made.
</p>

<p>
	Have you considered how many people would have been killed without the drone strikes? What the alternatives to drone strikes are?
</p>

<p>
	See, when you sit at home and judge others, that's easy. When you are put in charge of the world's largest military and tasked to defend Americans, that's a whole new ballgame. Don't forget, they will replace you with someone more bloodthirsty if you don't make them feel defended.
</p>

<p>
	The rules for world leaders are not the same rules as middle school. Death is baked into every decision you make at that scale.
</p>

<p>
	A naive stage Green does not appreciate such politcal complexities. It just wants peace to magically happen. This is the biggest problem with progressives. They act like all this is so easy, and then of course they complain and pout when they can barely win power in a real world election. Much easier to be right in your own head vs making things happen in a world full of selfish devils who want to eat you alive.
</p>

<p>
	Obama is a butcher compared to a middle school teacher. But that is the wrong comparison.

<p>
	If it was so easy, we would have done it a long time ago.
</p>

<p>
	It's a super complex political and systemic issue. It's not simply a matter of food delivery. Many people in poverty have serious mental health issues. How you gonna magically solve that? You give them food, they will sell it to buy crack. You give them food, a local warlord will bully it away from them to sell. Delivering free food to many of the worst countries is impossible because local dictators, mafias, and warlords will not allow it.

			Whats your view on professing spiritual love, being honest about your insecurities/fears, and showing weakness as a form of vulnerability to a girl you've been with for 8 months?

<p>
	8 months, then sure, no problem if you do it right.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Not sure. That need has never arisen for me.
</p>

<p>
	If I cry in front of a woman it's tears of spiritual joy, not depression. And they love that.
</p>

<p>
	It also depends on how much you're crying. If you do it rarely, like once a month, no problem at all. If you do it every day, that could become a problem.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I think it depends on the girl. If she's in love with you, then you can probably get away with it. Although if you wallow in negativity and weakness for weeks and months on end, she may start to lose attraction. But again, this depends on the girl. Some girls will stick around no matter what, even if you beat her. Usually, once a girl falls in love with you, she's pretty damn committed to you. It takes a lot to repel her at that point.

			Is it all a game? Is there no time and place for this and I'm just killing attraction and killing our vibe every-time I'm honest? Or does a higher consciousness relationship require this level of vulnerability and honesty?

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, it's not all a game. You can drop most of the game once she's in love with you. But of course she will still always have her own needs and desires. No one wants to be around a chronically depressed person.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be afraid to be REAL in a deep committed relationship. That will actually deepen the bond. But also, take care of yourself man. Don't use women to be your emotional tampons. It's your responsibility as a guy to handle your emotions.

<p>
	Or how about be of some service to mankind and earn some coin?
</p>

<p>
	This idea that money is evil while begging for food is noble is absurd and needs to be jettisoned. It certainly does not work in modern develop countries. Maybe it worked 2000 years ago.

<p>
	Don't frame it like that.
</p>

<p>
	You are just holding back your raging neediness and being a cool, chill guy.
</p>

<p>
	There are certain unspoken protocols to dating and attraction. It's like a mating dance. You must dance in a certain way or you mess it up. You would never text the girl, "Hey, let's bang", even if you two both want it, because that breaks the protocols of the dance. You must proceed slowly and not just dump all your cards on the table. She doesn't want that. She wants you to attract her in a smooth and natural manner so she doesn't feel like a slut. And you must demonstrate to her that you're a high value guy. And a high value guy never professes his spiritual love for a girl he hasn't even slept with.
</p>

<p>
	It will be a delicate balancing act. I'm not making these changes to attract more viewers, but to give the work a higher caliber image for existing and future viewers. In the past I didn't think the image of the work mattered so much, but now I realize that casual attitude cannot hold up in the future as we grow. It needs to feel more professional.
</p>

<p>
	I think I can tone it down without losing the directness, honesty, and in-your-faceness. I want to be direct without being offensive or obnoxious, which I sometimes come off as. It will take me some practice to find the right balance. It should be subtle.

<p>
	So, after considering the situation, I've decided to retract my dating post because I see people getting resentful and this undermines the focus of my teachings, which is more important to me than dating. People will try to use this to demonize my teachings in the future, which I don't want to have to deal with as I get enough of that already.
</p>

<p>
	For those who supported me, thanks and I appreciate your support. But I have to learn to be more careful with image issues and political correctness going forward because the pressures will become great to demonize my teachings as Actualized.org grows in size and naturally develops more enemies who will misconstrue everything I say in order to invalidate the work. This is something I have to think about more seriously going forward because really these teachings should be as little about me as possible. Ideally I want to take my personal self out of the teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry, my mistake. Party's over folks.
</p>

<p>
	In the future I will be making further changes to my style and manner of delivery in order to make the teachings more selfless and tactful. The days where Actualized.org could be the wild west are coming to an end. As the size grows, image issues become more serious and important. This seems to be the nature of politics and public relations that I don't have much experience with. I am still learning to navigate these waters because my natural style is blunt and politically incorrect. I notice that I have to be much more careful and responsible as more people watch my content in ways that were not normal for me in the early days. I am looking forward to cleaning up my presentation so that it is more selfless and then you don't have worry so much about your friends saying that you are following a cult leader. Although of course that will be said no matter what due to the nature of the material we study.
</p>

<p>
	I apologize for not being more forward-thinking about these issues.
</p>

<p>
	One of the things I also plan to do in the future is clean up my language and stop dropping f-bombs. I've been thinking of doing that for some time now, and this situation will hasten that. I have been seeing for a while now that these changes will be necessary for what Actualized.org is to become in the future. My style needs to mature to reflect the gravity of the work. I will also hold myself to a higher standard as a role-model, because even though I don't particularly want to be one, people will treat me like one regardless and it is my responsibility to take that one as part of delivering these teachings. It just comes with the job.
</p>

	You don't know shit, son.
</p>

<p>
	Listen to the wisdom of a 1000 rejections.
</p>

<p>
	Forget about love for a month. This is not the place for it. Attraction is what you have for her. You are desperate to be with her.
</p>

<p>
	Doesn't matter if she approached you. You need to cool down by 1000%. If it's true she approached you, then you can play it real cool and easy. Keep your texts short and lite. No walls of text. Nothing serious. Use texts to set up an evening coffee date. Keep all texts short and playful.

	Of course you can self-actualize and learn a lot, but at some point you will probably outgrow that job and want to find something more refined.

	For the love of God, stop treating this girl like a princess. Do not try anything deep or spiritual.

<p>
	Text her: "Hey dork"

<p>
	NO SPECIAL CONNECTION! NO LOVE!
</p>

<p>
	You are needy as fuck and she will instantly reject you.
</p>

<p>
	You need to play it cool, like you don't care about her at all. You must be the prize, not her. As soon as she feels that you think she is the prize, you will lose her.

<p>
	Look, take it easy. Deconstructing reality is the most challenging work in the universe. Sometimes you gotta take a short break and just enjoy life. Then get back to deconstructing. If you want. Don't do this work if you don't love it at some level.

<p>
	I have no idea since I'm no corporate climbing woman.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly there will be challenges there. You are dealing with stage Orange men who will be very masculine in their attitude and probably will not take you seriously unless you kick some ass and grab some balls.
</p>

<p>
	You should seek out a woman in corporate for better advice.

Girls don't like to hurt your feelings so it's easier for them to say that compared to something like "i don't find you attractive".

<p>
	Let's say she was just being nice, then she rejected me for my looks, which is even worse.
</p>

<p>
	But in that specific case, she literally looked at me, took my necklace in her hand, and said, "Ewww... I don't like this. Go away."
</p>

<p>
	And I've had girls not return my texts even after we slept together. Fucking cold.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Welcome to reality.
</p>

<p>
	You know, it's not like us men sat down and decided one day: we will be attracted to X but not Y. Attraction is not a choice.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: why aren't you attracted to a gorilla? When you get to the bottom of that one, you may understand why not everyone is attracted to you.
</p>

<p>
	No one likes being rejected for any aspect of themselves, flesh or otherwise. Rejection always hurts. And women reject men all the time over the most superficial things. I've had women reject me because of the necklace I wore. I've had women punch me in the mouth and I couldn't hit her back.
</p>

<p>
	That's life. You suck it up.
</p>

<p>
	I have literally been rejected 1000s of times. Some nights I'd go home and cry. It's good for the ego. Makes you stronger. Teaches you not to care what people think.
</p>

<p>
	I am suggesting dating is a survival game and honesty was never its goal.
</p>

<p>
	I like being honest about what dating is. So as not to fool ourselves with stories about it.
</p>

<p>
	None of this means you can't have a decent relationship. Just understand that both sides are playing games. And that's okay. Life is an interplay and life is sneaky.

<p>
	Pickup works of course, but:
</p>

<p>
	A) I don't really enjoy clubs and bars. I did that earlier in my life because it forced me to grow. I would rather be meditating. Chasing girls is not so appealing to me since my time is valuable. I am not a social person by temperment. I can be happy living in a cave. And one day I may just completely leave society behind and you may never hear from me again.

<p>

	It's not assumed, it's a given.
</p>

<p>
	If you and I weren't one, we could not communicate.
</p>

<p>
	Your very communication with me disproves your point.
</p>

<p>
	You simply aren't contemplating how reality works. You're just spitting ideas out.

<p>

<p>
	There is an order of operations to dating. Don't go too deep too fast. But eventually you can go deep. You have to calibrate.

<p>
	I love going deep, but only at the right time.

<p>
	It depends a lot on the level of development of the people you commune with. If they are low in development, stage Red or Orange, they will preceive nice as too weak to survive.
</p>

<p>
	Nice gets appreciated and valued at stage Green and above.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you try to be nice in prison, it will backfire.

	YES! Very good. Now that's some progress. You are an enneagram type 2. Classic girly problem.
</p>

<p>
	You sacrifice yourself too much for others to the point of not taking care of your needs enough. You need more self-care and self-love. Be more selfish.

You gotta be very clever and intelligent about it. You gotta be like a fox.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that all of reality runs on cleverness. Brute force approaches are not smart enough to solve the deep problems.
</p>

<p>
	The problem you're facing is a lack of requisite variety (a cybernetics term). See my blog post video on Requisite Variety. It will explain everything.

	If you are a social person you can ask people this question: "What is a problem that keeps nagging you? Keeps you up at night?"
</p>

<p>
