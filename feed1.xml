	You are EVERYTHING, which means you are every asshole and rapist who ever lived. Get used to it. Stop judging reality, since you are it.
</p>

<p>
	Accept that you are EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is not about becoming a good person or attaining a good future. It is about accepting EVERYTHING. Absolutely. All the ugliest shit you must accept. There is no other way to get peace.

	Yeah, that's the bitch, breaking into heaven and then falling back down into petty human affairs.
</p>

<p>
	With time you will forget about heaven and the human crap becomes a bit more tolerable.

</p>

<p>
	You are not going to create a DMT breakthrough by will. To feed newbies this idea is beyond irresponsible. That's like telling a Covid patient he can cure himself by will, and if he can't, he's just not trying hard enough.

Do not discourage regular people from getting the vaccine. This is irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
	No one has ever said that vaccines don't have some very rare side effects. Every medicine and chemical has rare side effects. That is not sufficient reason to discourage their use for average people.
</p>

<p>
	If you fed peanuts to 100 million people, some would have severe reactions. That is not a case against peanuts.
</p>

<p>
	Covid kills 1000s of people. This vaccines does not.

<p>
	Obviously yes. Nothing I say goes against that.

<p>
	The point is to make yourself so attractive that she is begging to have sex with you.

<p>
	You're not going to logically persuade a girl to have sex with you anyways.
</p>

<p>
	But sometimes she can be hesitant. You gotta make her comfortable.
</p>

<p>
	Lead, lead, lead. Then if she says No, you of course back off.
</p>

<p>
	Most weak guys give up way too soon. So for such guys it is good advice to burn every set to the ground. Make her tell you NO! Push it to see what you can get away with. This does not mean forcing yourself on her, but be persistent. This is not really necessary in normal dating situations, but if you are hitting the bars and clubs and doing cold approach and SNLs, then you gotta get good at dealing with all the BS obstacles and logistics. If you are doing casual dating from your social circle then such things are not necessary. But in a place like Vegas you gotta burn every set to the ground and push the envelope.

You need to find the substances which align with your brain and metabolism.
</p>

<p>
	Some nausea on 5-MeO-DMT is normal. Sometimes the nausea can be quite strong.
</p>

<p>
	20mg is not that much plugged. You could certainly go up to 30mg and higher. 20mg vs 30mg is a HUGE difference in potency.
</p>

<p>
	If that doesn't work then look for other substances which sit better with you.
</p>

<p>
	There is no guarantee that 5-MeO-DMT will produce deep mystical experiences for you. For some people it just won't work.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Vaping is always more potent than plugging. So watch out. Lower your dose and go very slow. Don't take big hits.
</p>

<p>
	Some people tend to be immune or tolerant to plugging. In which case you should see a big bump in potency from vaping. So be careful. It's easy to over-vape.
</p>

<p>
	If 5-MeO-DMT works properly on you, you should be having the most profound mystical experiences imaginable. If you are not having that, you're clearly tolerant to it for whatever reason. The mystical experiences should be so deep that they make your eyes bulge out of your head.

</p>

<p>
	The harsh truth you don't want to accept is that you're needy. Which is why this whole thing bothers you. And she probably smelled it off you and ran away.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that will lose you girls faster than neediness is creepiness. Girls know how to sniff out neediness the way pigs sniff out truffles. She sniffed you out for a week or two and found you lacking.
</p>

<p>
	You will keep losing girls until you bite the bullet and grow into a stronger man with some balls.

<p>
	Other people not existing has nothing to do with coping.
</p>

<p>
	It's about becoming so conscious that you become conscious that all others are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful who you assume is deeply awake. There's a lot of shallow awakening on YT.
</p>

<p>
	If you have any emotional attachment, it's to other people being real.

			Thanks for the reply Leo!<br />
			It seems however that you're saying that they are living more happily and with flow and love because of their ignorance (if I understood correctly), while I am more stuck and have resistance because I am contemplating more (?)<br />
			But it kind of goes against what you say, because if they are not so conscious then how are they living with more flow? Isn't it the case that the more conscious you are, the more loving and at flow you are?

<p>
	There is a heavy cost for awakening.
</p>

<p>
	It's high investment, high return.
</p>

<p>
	You are in that phase of this journey where your investment is high but return little.
</p>

<p>
	Consider that all the greatest things in life have high upfront investment with little immediate return.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why fools stay poor.
</p>

<p>
	The fool is one who judges a thing by its short-term returns.
</p>

<p>
	There is no question your friends are fools. The only question is you.

			To give a better explanation of how this mindfulness and self acceptance have helped me:<br />
			So I have always been sucked into youtube going through rabbit holes of self help (for mental masturbation, obviously), and pretty much spent my day thinking about improving, and believing I'm improving by hardly doing a thing. My mind was very very weak and I was literally not able to do almost any activity that required my input, it was just to threatening. I'm talking about even fear of playing a video game, which I still do (because it's an emerging into a new world and I might lose myself, if it makes more sense). But I have managed to play the piano a bit (it became easier for me to be present and to risk the dirty process of learning and making mistakes and becoming creative and committing).<br />
			All of this is nice and great, but it feels for me like those things are very easy and natural to many other people. And yet, I am the one working on raising my consciousness! How could it be that I'm still behind?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The reality is that you have hardly even begun to do consciousness work. You think you're doing it, but you've only dipped your toe in the water, hence you don't have much results.
</p>

<p>
	If you are going to pursue a conscious life, you have to hold yourself to very different standards than average people. You take on WAY more responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	But also: Don't forget to have fun too! Don't be too serious about life.

<p>
	What I said has nothing to do with fear. It's just common sense that when 45 mass shootings happen per month, and you hear someone firing a gun on the streets, you gotta be very proactive about it. You don't know his age, you don't know if he threw the gun away. You gotta assume he could be a mass shooter. Many of these mass shooters are like 19 years old.

	Again, the cop doesn't know there won't be a gun fight.

			Leo I have something to tell
		</p>

		<p>
			I plugged 30mg today DPT hcl with no results at all! The substance couldn't dissolve in water solution that good so I heat the syringe with tap water. The syringe was closed with a needle and sealed, I saw the substance dissolving a little more but I didn't wanted to over do it, after plugging I inspect the syringe and I found white powder inside. I let this method for now,. I snorted 20mg and felt almost nothing, I hadn't eat all day so my stomach was a bit messy also after the plugging process. So I decided to eat a toast and a slice of cheese only just to get my blood sugar up because of the discomfort and I went out with my dog as I felt better it started to kick me, it was nothing more than a warmth in my body and fingers shaking, I got a relief about what it is as a triptamine and on my way home I was thinking about it and planning one more attempt.  I snorted 40mg, my nose is perfect, no dripping no bad taste, I licked a bit of the powder and my tongue got numb, it's not happening with all triptamines, my gut would say, eating it would work pretty well on me, I got an intense body load very sensual and pleasant and was trying to explore it, it reminded me 5meo-mipt on a bit higher dose. On the trip I was contemplating how deep you described it as an experience, you are in a total higher frequencies when you trip,  I discovered that my brain doesn't use the substance completely, your brain is using the substance chemically with out a thought your brain is very efficient, this is why you don't need much of a substance and you go so deep, the substance is doing me but you do the substance.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm afraid to use a way larger doses because I'm home alone so I need to train my brain to use the substances for efficient. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The dpt has huge potential for contemplation like the 4ho-mipt when the body load goes away  but I want to have a solid trip with 5meo-dmt first to take my fear away to go higher on dpt. I got hcl and want to try plugged
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	40mg for DPT, plugged, for an average person is too low of a dose. You won't feel much.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that I am 2x to 3x more sensitive than normal folk when it comes to psychedelics. So a 40mg trip for me is like an 80-120mg trip for normies.
</p>

<p>
	DPT is not like 5-MeO-DMT or 4-AcO-DMT or 4-HO-DMT. It requires a much larger dose.
</p>

<p>
	It is not obvious to a cop in the middle of the night that he put his hands up vs was turning around to aim his gun.
</p>

<p>
	If the kid throws the gun aside 3 seconds earlier the cop doesn't know that.

</p>

<p>
	The media is going hogwild with these stories and framing them in a skewed way.
</p>

<p>
	This kid had a gun in his hands in the middle of the night 1 second before he was shot. After shots were fired in the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
	He wasn't shot for no reason.

	Yes, but you'd have to really operate outside the box to actualize it.

<p>
	If you are an ectomorph, of course.
</p>

<p>
	If you eat a whole foods based diet it's hard to get fat. Getting fat mostly comes from eating processed foods which are super calorie dense, nutrient dense, and addictive. Like cookies.
</p>

<p>
	Most fat people eat junk food. That's why they fat. And most of that junk food is refined carbs.

<p>
	You can get skinnier on an ice cream and bacon diet. If you eat less calories than you burn in a day.
</p>

<p>
	Eating 2500 calories of fruits per day is not so easy. And fruit carbs are way better and less calorie dense than refined carbs. If you are replacing Standard American Diet with fruits, of course you will lose weight and be healthier. You are going from more carbs to less carbs.

<p>
	Repressing sex definitely does not work. So I say indulge in it in a conscious way and exhaust your urges until you are bored with it.
</p>

<p>
	But also, sex and dating can be a giant waste of time. So be careful not to get your mind hijacked by it.
</p>

<p>
	You're damned if you do and damned if you don't. Welcome to life.
</p>

<p>
	And do not fool yourself that you will use sex to reach enlightenment or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	The point of this thread is that men are luckier than women, because it's easier for a man to raise his sexual value.
</p>

<p>
	Takes lots of work though.
</p>

<p>
	Exceptionally physically good-looking men and women alike get special treatment. This has always been the case and will always be the case. It is like being born to a millionaire family. It is a rare gift that lands in your lap. And if you get it, you will certainly use it to advance your survival.

	Yes, this is good and you should pursue that. Build your life. Build a custom life that suits you.

<p>
	No, because there are psychedelics. Which is exactly the point. You can also modify your DNA and so forth.
</p>

<p>
	And you still have that 5% techniques. Don't dismiss that. You can do a lot with 5% if you really want to.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is really a technology problem. Gurus don't ever mention this factor.

	If you are starving you will eat anything.
</p>

<p>
	Most species on Earth are starving every day. They will eat anything they can just to live one more day.
</p>

<p>
	Eating lots of fruits makes me disgusted. It's easier to eat a lot of meat than a lot fruit. The sweetness becomes cloying and nauseating after a while. There is nothing natural about eating an all-fruit diet. Large juicy fruits are very rare in nature. They are like rare treats you stumble upon, not a staple you gorge on for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Fruits are not even in season most of the time.
</p>

<p>
	Go out into the wilderness and see how many fruits you can find and how long you can survive on them. And WTF are you gonna do in the winter?

<p>
	I'm telling you, the vast majority of spirituality is genetic. Doubt me if you want, but it is what it is.
</p>

<p>
	It's the elephant in the room no teacher dare speak. Yet the facts bear it out. It's not for lack of techniques that creatures lack God-realization. If you are born an ant, you're fucked.
</p>

<p>
	Simple and obvious really. You just don't want to accept it. And none of your rationales or excuses will change this.
</p>

<p>
	But hey, I will not try to debate it or prove it to you. Find out for yourselves.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is like 95% genetics and 5% techniques. Gurus don't tell you this cause it's bad for business.
</p>

<p>
	If you doubt this, take a look at a donkey. How many spiritual donkeys do you know? It ain't for lack of technique.
</p>

<p>
	If not for this, everyone would be awake and humans wouldn't be so dumb. It's hard to fix stupid with a technique. That's the bottom line.

	It's true that it is easier for a man to increase his attractiveness simply because women are less attracted to looks than men are.
</p>

<p>
	It's easier to change your personality, status, wealth, and game than your looks. But even so, it's still not easy and most guys are too lazy to do it.

They do not have a normie brian or neurochemistry. Which is why they rose to the level of a teacher. They are worldclass people.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why less than 0.0001% of the planet is awake. Most folk simply lack the hardware to do it. Psychedelics help bridge that gap.
</p>

<p>
	Some people are basically born mystics and enlightened. Some do zero work to get it. It's like being born with a huge cock. Yeah, a guy born with a footlong cock doesn't need any pills. But is that you?

			In theory, yes. Yet not always easy to do.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've been in parts of Central and South American in which a white tourist could not fully trust corrupted police. A police encounter had a significant chance of me getting abused. Intellectually, I knew I had better odds complying, yet there were a couple situations in which fleeing was on the table. It was extremely difficult to keep my composure and interact with the officer. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, it's not just abuse at the point of arrest. It is the whole legal process of the justice and prison system. There were places in which complying with an arrest had a risk of being screwed over at the police station, courts and jail. My desire to flee was most strongly fueled by what could happen <em>after </em>complying with the arrest. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Being black in some areas means that there is a risk of getting screwed over after the arrest. If the justice system was fair to black people, there would be far less people resisting arrest. As a middle-income, educated white person, I have very low risk complying with police since I know I will be treated fairly through the process. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I think it's very hard for people that lack the experience to imagine what it's like.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You make some valid points.
</p>

<p>
	But still, resisting arrest is dangerous and will always be.
</p>

<p>
	If I resist arrest in a rich white neighborhood in the manner this guy did, I still expect to get tasered and roughed up at the least.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there is systemic racism and police abuse. But there is also stupid action by lawbreakers. Again, these are not mutually exclusive. Criminals tend to behave in irrational and stupid ways which makes them difficult to handle.

<p>
	Yes, being chill, nonreactive, detached, and masculine is all good and important. But while doing those things you must actively approach, and you should be more emotional, silly, and playful.
</p>

<p>
	Half James Bond, half clown.
</p>

<p>
	PLAYFULNESS is the #1 key to game. James Bond is too fucking serious.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that girls will not give you the same attention Bond gets. Because Bond is fiction. No guy gets that kind of attention automatically without being a celebrity. So you have to grab her attention and keep it captivated with effort.

<p>
	Sorry, I don't buy this logic.

<p>
	Running from/fighting with cops is a very bad idea no matter what color you are, but especially if you black. It's dangerous all around. And even if you are black the statistical chances of you being killed by a cop while arrested is like 1 per million if you don't try to flee. So fleeing is just the dumbest possible idea. It shouldn't get you killed, but that is legit a risk.

			That's the problem. And also her using a gun instead of a taser is not her simply being "sloppy", its her not doing her job correctly. The whole point of police training is to be able to handle situations like this, and if you can't be work under situational pressure, then you should not even be a cop. If a firetruck driver accidentally ran over a civilian, him being "sloppy" isn't an excuse.

<p>
	Being sloppy is not an excuse, it is what happened. People make mistakes. I'm sure she feels like shit about it. And she will still be tried for manslaughter. It is manslaughter but I would not hold her morally guilty for murder because she obviously made a simple mistake, which all of us are capable of on the job.
</p>

<p>
	She worked under pressure for years. And today she made 1 simple mistake, which will be the worst mistake of her life. I'm sure she will regret it for the rest of her life. It's tragic on both sides. But that's life. If she gets a sentence I prose it should be very light.

<p>
	I don't know. Nobody knows. There is no algorithm for it. It's not something the ego can control.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking paranormal abilities cannot be quantified or treated in a materialistic fashion. Which means you cannot say "it takes X hours of meditation to develop telekensis". It does not work like that. It's much more complex and blurry than that. That's why it's called mysticism and the occult. It is not quantifiable.

<p>
	Find out and come back and tell us.

<p>
	You are treating this topic as though we have all the answers when in fact we have almost none of the answers. To answer your questions would require 1000 years of serious scientific research.

<p>
	Mankind does not know how paranormal abilities work. We are not there yet. We hardly know which food causes cancer and you are asking about crazy paranormal stuff.

<p>
	By definitions Siddhis violate the rules of physics, chemistry, biology, and science.
</p>

<p>
	All those rules are imaginary and you gain Siddhis in direct proportion to your consciousness that those rules are imaginary. Consciousness of their imaginary nature IS what allows you to violate them. You literally unimagine them.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The limit is nothing other than your level of consciousness. As your consciousness becomes infinite all the rules melt away into nothing until you are completely God, with infinite creative capacity.
</p>

<p>
	But it is not how you think. God' infinite creative capacity cannot be used for any selfish act. It can only be used for Love, and this Love is so total and absolute that you have zero control or say over it. So it's the opposite of what you want: you as God become totally powerless. You can't, for example, use this power to make yourself rich or do anything selfish, because selfishness itself is a loss of infinite power.

<p>
	We break those "rules" with science all the time. We call it technology.

<p>
	You might as well ask, "What are the limits of science?" And the answer is, none. Science is unlimited if you keep doing it long enough.

<p>

<p>
	Religions claim a lot of bullshit. It's mostly exaggerated myths.
</p>

<p>
	But also, the human body has no size. Scale is imaginary and relative. Your body is precisely the same size as an atom or the sun. You only imagine there is a size difference.

<title>Why doesn't the James Bond approach work?</title>

<p>
	The James Bond approach is too passive. James Bond is a fictional character who magically attracts the best pussy by just standing around and looking sharp. This is every guy's FANTASY. It does not work in the real world unless you're a celebrity. An ordinary guy has to be much more active about approaching girls and dealing with lots of rejection.
</p>

<p>
	When there are 200 guys at the club, if you just stand around acting cool, waiting for a girl to notice you, you'll get nowhere because nothing about you stands out and other guys are being active and emotionally stimulating the girls. The girls want to be emotionally stimulated.
</p>

<p>
	You'll get more girls by being silly than acting cool.

<title>LEO claiming Jesus Miracles are true and other far fetched radical claims</title>

</p>

<p>
	You have to take into account those radical things I said are true ONLY from extremely radical, super-human states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Not only are these things impossible from your current state of consciousness, they are not even imaginable. You cannot imagine how it is possible. Because your consciousness is nowhere close to super-human right now. You are like a donkey trying to make sense of calculus.
</p>

<p>
	More broadly, this topic of Siddhis has been discussed and confirmed by most of the greatest mystics. So I am not saying anything unusual here. This is par for the course if you are an advanced spiritual student. But if you are a normie materialist, rationalist -- yeah, it makes no sense whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
	I have personally experienced telepathy and many other even more magical and radical things that no materialist would believe are possible. Let me assure you, consciousness is not limited in any way. There is nothing impossible for consciousness to do if it wants to do them. BUT! That does not mean your ego will get to control theses things, in the way materialists hope and imagine.

			I'm giving you a fair critique.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's not about making your work idiot-proof. You'd never succeed. I'm not saying you should be perfect about it because that's just not possible.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm saying that it's unwise to share your teachings in a way that's easily misconstrued (and used for devilry) by the majority of people... especially since you have such a large public platform.
		</p>

		<p>
			I saw like two or three people on this thread alone that took your insight and the way you shared it and then they were like, "Yep! I agree with Leo. Junk food is good for me." 
		</p>

		<p>
			And I know that's ridiculous. But people are ridiculous. And as a leader, you would be wise to be more responsible with teaching people in a manor that doesn't so easily lead to devilry and self-deception. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Here on the forum, you seem to prefer sharing things with a short punchy style where you can portray a demeanor of certainty and firmness. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But this style really seems to backfire if your goal is to elucidate things to your audience and get them to understand.
		</p>

		<p>
			All I'm saying is that it would be wise to at least <u><strong>try</strong></u> to avoid being purposefully cryptic. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I understand what you're saying.
</p>

<p>
	My true teachings are my videos, where I over explain everything. This forum is not a formal teaching, it is casual interaction. Yeah, I post cryptic stuff here sometimes because I am not going to put the same attention to detail into a forum post as I do a video or a blog post. My responses on this forum are causal and conversational -- like if you were chatting with a professor at the bar vs him lecturing in his classroom.

<p>
	It wasn't a regular traffic stop. The guy had an outstanding arrest warrant. The cops had to take him in on that warrant and as they were doing so he started resisting arrest and fleeing.
</p>

<p>
	Using a taser in that situation is fully justified. But not shooting him of course.
</p>

<p>
	Although if he got in that car and started driving away, I think shooting at him would be justified too. You can't just get in a car and flee an arrest warrant and not have cops shoot at you. Keep in mind, that car can be used as a weapon, and it could contain weapons.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the taser should have solved this whole problem. That is its function. Looks like the cop was panicking and got sloppy.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to say. Cholesterol is not the only factor. There is a more general question of how healthy it is to eat large quantities of meat. There is also cancer and many other considerations.
</p>

<p>
	I don't think the fructose in whole fruits is anything to worry about. It's balanced out with fiber and many other nutrients. And of course one should not be eating too many fruits overall, more veggies.

You do not understand my situation and I am not going to waste time explaining to you. I have a dozen people giving me unsolicited and blind advice in a dozen different directions. Yet they don't even know my health situation or what I have already tried. It's a waste of time. It's not wise to stick your nose too much in someone else's business. I know you're just trying to help, but you know nearly nothing about my health.

	<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sibo-notes/treatment" rel="external nofollow">https://sites.google.com/view/sibo-notes/treatment</a>
</p>

<p>
	In my experience, none of that will work unless you radically cut out all carbs from your diet. Ideally carnivore for at least a month or two. Stop consuming all carbs entirely.
</p>

<p>
	Before you invest in all these treatment protocols make sure your do a SIBO breath test to verify that you have hydrogen or methane SIBO. The breath test is crucial.

It's the standard anti-microbial supplement treatment plan: allicin, berberine, and grapefruit seed extract.
</p>

<p>
	I've been taking those for months to no avail.
</p>

<p>
	And I am still experimenting with various supplement combos.
</p>

<p>
	Carnivore diet has been way more effective for me then any supplement combo I've tried so far. And I've tried something like 100+ supplements.
</p>

<p>
	Supplements are useless when there is an underlying autoimmune condition triggered by diet and toxins.

<p>
	Yes, consciousness is missing.
</p>

<p>
	When you become infinitely conscious you will drown in an Infinite Love that never ends.
</p>

<p>
	NDE's and occult practices are still low consciousness stuff compared to what I am talking about.
</p>

<p>
	God would never punish anyone because God IS everyone. Punishment is only desired by limited beings and fragmented consciousness. Infinite Consciousness has no need whatsoever for punishment and in fact it is literally incapable of punishment because all it can do is Love itself endlessly.
</p>

<p>
	GOD IS LOVE.
</p>

<p>
	Why would it be anything less?

<p>
	But if I had to choose between living 65 years on carnivore vs 80 years on vegan, with how much better I feel on carnivore factored in, I would rather live 65. No doubts about it.
</p>

<p>
	Longevity is meaningless without energy and quality of life. I can accomplish more work in 65 of carnivore than 80 years of vegan. At least given my current health condition. Hopefully I can change that.

			Leo, on the video you say carnivore is not for the long term but on the other hand the inuit and every hunter-gatherer tribe from the beginning of time ate mostly meat, for their entire life. Meat has been always the main food of humans. How can that be bad now when it wasn't bad our entire existence? I mean those tribes didn't have modern illnessess like we do now.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Longevity in meateating tribes is not good. They get clogged arteries. Most of them simply don't live long enough to get a stroke or heart attack because tribal folk tend to die young of natural causes.
</p>

<p>
	High meat diet will definitely skyrocket your cholestorol, the bad kind.

<p>
	Close to 3lbs of meat/chicken/salmon all combined per day.

<p>
	On carnivore you got little choice in the matter. You must eat however much calories your body requires per day. Oil and butter can help reduce the meat intake a bit.

<title>Is it legitimate for my life purpose to be &quot;to manifest the experience of 5-MeO-DMT&quot;?</title>

Try to bridge the gap with a life purpose that's a bit more closer to your experience of life. You are making an LP about a thing you haven't even experienced, don't know is real, and don't even know if you will like.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta test all those waters first and see if it really is something you're passionate about. Don't assume your passions, feel for them in the now. What are you passionate about now that in part of your life experience?
</p>

<p>
	You can always expand out into 5-MeO or awakening once you experience it and find it resonates.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with assuming too much is that you will find you aren't as passionate about that thing as you thought once you actually experience it. It can be easy to fall in love with the IDEA of a thing rather than the thing itself. So be careful not to fall into that trap.
</p>

	Yeah. I'm not surprised at all. You can smell those toxic Red and Orange fumes from a mile away. It's so obvious once you got some consciousness. I've only watched Brian for like 3 minutes, and that was enough for me to smell the fumes.

<p>
	BTW, I found a great interview he did with Sadhguru -- where Sahdguru basically tells him about how toxic modern politics is. And then Brian goes on to do this toxic mayoral campaign, Lol

<p>
	They earn way less than $35k/yr.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know what the exact salary should be, but it's also not only about salary, it is about unionization, benefits, good treatment, paid time off, parental leave, and democracy at the workplace.

<p>
	Peeing in bottles is not how employees should be treated.
</p>

<p>
	Given how ridiculously wealthy Amazon is, working there should be a pleasure, not slavery. People there should be working 4 days a week and getting month-long vacations.

<p>
	It's a fine personal goal, but LP is not about what you do for yourself. It's about what you want to do for others.
</p>

<p>
	So in this case once you finally reach your goal, a valid LP would be to spread that experience to others.
</p>

<p>
	So you're close to an LP, but you're stilling thinking of it too selfishly.
</p>

<p>
	Your LP might be to help OTHERS expeirence 5-MeO-DMT. Although that is risky business so be careful with how you go about that.

	Nice!
</p>

<p>
	It's true of course, but still, on a practical level it seems like practicing love is not enough without also changing your state of conscioussness somehow.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really love from a low state of consciousness, and these fucking entities should know that.

<p>
	Vegan diet is definitely the diet I feel worst on. It does not work for me at all, and I tried it multiple times.
</p>

<p>
	And it is basically impossible to do vegan diet when you got a bad case of SIBO. You would be in so much pain you would want to kill yourself.

<p>
	Basically yes.
</p>

<p>
	You need to complete 5 or 10 years of basic self-help work before you can start to appreciate the value of higher things like God or Love or consciousness or Truth or spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing wrong with that. You can't grow faster than you're able. Spend the next 5-10 years building your basic success in life. Then come back and we'll talk about God.

	Again, you have gotten yourself stuck in this very narrow version of wokeness. Why are you so stubborn? Why not relax your rigid rules? Learn to play and be creative. Use the mind creatively, if your mind is truly free. Doesn't sound like your mind is truly free though.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't know the full mechanism. I just know the big picture.
</p>

<p>
	Your question is basically a highly technical scientific question. We would need a team of advance scientists to study and map out the mechanism. And the mechanism is always going to be infinite so you can keep mapping reality forever and never reach the end.
</p>

<p>
	All mechanistic explanations must recede into infinite complexity.

			There are trends that will crystalize into a new type/wave of Billionaires soon who will bring forth many new perspectives, including increased harmony. Similar to the Entrepreneurship wave that was created by the Internet. This both the high range (50-100 Billion net worth) and also 100-200  new people entering the Billionaires club about the 1-2 Billion range. All with product and service creation primarily. Not Wall Street types. This is expected to continue for the next couple hundred years at least easily with no effective way to change it.
		</p>

		<p>
			What are your thoughts on that?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I do believe that in general, business people and businesses will be forced to become more conscious or go extinct.
</p>

<p>
	But the question is at what pace this happens and to what extent. And there there are practical concerns about how much to tax them, how to regulate them, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I don't have a problem with people earning lots of money by truly generating lots of value for mankind via genuine creative labor. What I have a problem with is business-people who leech and exploit the working class. And either way, even those genuine creative folk need to be taxed and regulated more.
</p>

<p>
	If you earn over $5 mill per year, you should be taxed very heavily because the only reason you're able to earn that much money is thanks to a community and a society. You are not doing it on your own. The community is allowing you to do it. Therefore you should not be allowed to keep doing it at the expense of the community.
</p>

<p>
	No one would be pissed off at billionaires if they paid their taxes and paid their employees well and didn't corrupt the political system. Those are the real issues. Stop being a dick. That's all we're asking for.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, this is a rather uncharitable and self-serving position to take. Many people claim to have healed their gut with carnivore, and to dismiss these genuine people as liars or deluded doesn't sound wise. Perhaps the one fooling yourself in this case is you.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying it's guaranteed to work. But to claim it cannot work is not right since there is no possible way you have tested every person and their conditions. You're just speculating in a dogmatic fashion.
</p>

<p>
	I am also not claiming that carnivore diet is some ultimate long-term health plan.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to health and nutrition it's very important to respect the fact that people are different. What works for you will not work for everyone.
</p>

<p>
	I have no ideological attachment to any diet. I simply try them all out and see what works best for me. Currently carnivore is the best thing I found for my body. But that might change in the future as my health improves.

<p>
	The problem with such questions is that they assume an egoic definition of "I" or "you".
</p>

<p>
	You as this human will not experience anything more than being this human. But you as Nothingness can experience everything.
</p>

<p>
	You already ARE me. No need to return, just expand your state of consciousness.

	The only obstacle is a sense of finite self.

<p>
	Whenever you think of yourself as something less than EVERYTHING, that's the obstacle. Anything less than EVERYTHING isn't your full nature.

<p>
	Look at a toilet and whisper to yourself, "That's me!" And keep doing that until you stop feeling human.

<p>
	Because you are already creating exactly what you see.
</p>

<p>
	The ego thinks that God can use its infinite powers to do egoic stuff. Wrong! God cannot use its powers for anything but Infinite Love. So in sense God is totally powerless because God cannot be anything but Love. There is no choice about it. God cannot not be God. So here you are. You cannot not be you.
</p>

<p>
	You think beocoming God will make you powerful, but it will make you totally powerless. Because power and powerlessness are a duality which must come full-circle.
</p>

<p>
	The seeking of power is ego. So of course it must collapse.

</p>

<p>
	Too much existential/spiritual work can become counter-productive. You gotta balance it out with more ordinary work. Like, go work on your career, build some skills, make some sales. Then come back to spirituality and you'll appreciate it more.

<p>
	They are loud, but they are not massive.

<p>
	If you watch a lot of progressive YT, then you get a warped picture of Biden and his popularity. Progressives whine and yell a lot, but in the end Biden is very popular and most people tolerate him well enough. There will always be those 20% of the far right and left which can never be pleased because what they want is so unrealistic.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt Bernie Sanders would have been able to pass much better bills than Biden. The bottleneck is not Biden, it's the Republicans who stonewall everything, even moderate stuff. Until the Dems have a solid grasp over the Senate and House, Bernie is useless as President.

			So, then why are there more people in the US these days who are actually for culturally liberal issues and liberal judges (which are both stage Green if I am not mistaken)? Also, why have conservatives lost the popular vote in almost every presidential election since 1992? Furthermore, why are more people in our country in support of Democratic US senators (stage Orange/Green people if I am correct) than Republican US senators (stage Blue/Orange people if I am correct)?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In US urban areas Blue is quickly dying out. For consevatives to win the popular vote they need lots of stage Blue support, but this kind of support is dying out fast as Americans shift Orange. Trump appealed a lot to Orange conservatives.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to overpower Green by appealing to Blue/Orange, which was Trump's strategy.
</p>

<p>
	But it's also possible to overpower Blue by appealing to Green/Orange, which Biden did. And also Biden isn't so threatening to Blue. Biden exhibits many healthy Blue qualities. So overall Biden hits all the right notes with Blue, Orange, Green. There is a bit there for everyone to like and not much to hate. It's hard to hate Biden. This is one of the keys to his success. The only people who hate Biden are extremists, who are a minority.
