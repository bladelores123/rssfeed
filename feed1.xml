<p>
	I wouldn't say it was some chemical synergy. It's just that as I explore consciousness more from many different angels my understanding becomes more and more holistic.
</p>

<p>
	There is definitely a benefit to tripping with different substances so you can appreciate the full range of what consciousness can do.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with stuff like meditation is that it's so one-dimensional. You never see the full range.

<p>
	Smoke some salvia or DMT and you will see how insane consciousness can get.

<p>
	After a lot of trial of other things, I returned to 5-MeO-DMT and it took on a whole new level of power for me beyond any other thing I have tried.
</p>

<p>
	DPT is amazing, but I gotta say, these days, for me, 5-MeO-DMT is more amazing. The clarity of it is insane.

<p>
	You will experience something so freaky that your mind will not be able to make sense of it.
</p>

<p>
	It will probably terrify you. But that's exactly what you need.

<p>
	My first time I had a panic attack. And I've never had a panic attack in my life.
</p>

<p>
	You will probably think you've killed yourself.

	It felt like I was, but since then I've had about 20 or 30 even totaler Awakenings.
</p>

<p>
	They keep getting more total. Which seems absurd, but that's how it goes. It shocks me every time.

	The stat I quoted wasn't specifically from that article but from other places.
</p>

<p>
	Severe cases seem to range from 10% to 20% for ages 20-44. Depends on which stats you pull from. Stats vary by country.

<p>
	Salvia is too wacky. 5-MeO-DMT is where you'll find total Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	The length of it is irrelevant. It might only last 30 minutes. But during those 30 minutes it is total. There is no time during it.

		<p>
			When you talk about "you imagined this and that"   I dont know if you are talking from God POV or limited human form POV. Last would be solipsism. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There was a time when you always made it clear from which perspective you talk. Maybe you changed a lot. Are you from now on per default talking from Gods POV ?  If yes, I can read this whole thread again, lol.
		</p>

<p>
	Yes, I'm mostly talking from God's POV since you are God and that's what's True. Why would I talk from an invented human POV?
</p>

<p>
	Humans are not real things. They are imaginary. So let's stop talking as if they are real.
</p>

<p>
	If you see a picture of a human on TV, does that make that human real? No! Likewise, when you see a human walking down the street, does that make the human real? No! When you see your face in the mirror, does that make you a human? No! When you look down and see a human body which you think of as yours, does that make you a human? No! Just because you see some pictures doesn't mean you are those pictures.
</p>

<p>
	If I show you a picture of a kangaroo, does that make you a kangaroo? What if I make you wear a kangaroo suit? Would you become a kangaroo then?

	I understand. People have their own timelines. But they also love to be stubborn, make excuses, and drag their feet. Anything to avoid Awakening.

<p>
	Because Awakening is Absolute. The Absolute tends to be sure of itself.
</p>

<p>
	Why would God be unsure of itself? Unsureness suggests a lack of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But the converse is a trap: just because you're sure of yourself doesn't mean you are conscious.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said in my series: Understanding Duality, that's a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is imagining a distinction between temporary things and permanent things.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, all consciousness is Eternal and Absolute. Awakening transcends time since consciousness imagines time.
</p>

<p>
	If awakening was permanent how could anyone ever awaken? -- since they would already have been awake!
</p>

<p>
	God can exist in various states of self-awareness. In some states God is not self-aware at all. In other states God is mildly self-aware. And in other states God is fully self-aware. There are not just 3 or 10 of these states. There are thousands if not more.

<p>
	That doesn't hold up.

<p>
	The US government didn't crack down on the hippies because the hippies were draining their body energy.

<p>
	The US government cracked down because the hippies were starting to question all of the conservative Christian norms which held American society together.

	I have yet to see any evidence that psychedelics drain your body or harms your energetic system. If you want to make such claims, bring the evidence. Serious claims require serious evidence.

<p>
	My health issues are an independent variable. I've had a thyroid disease for 10 years, before I even started Actualized.org or knew about psychedelics. I've struggled with it for a long time. And as I get older my health isn't as good as it used to be.
</p>

<p>
	People are far too eager to blame psychedelics for anything that goes wrong.
</p>

<p>
	If I broke my leg tomorrow, people would say, "See! It's those damn psychedelics! I knew it!" Because people are looking any excuse they can find to reject psychedelics. Because psychedelics are gonna nuke that ego and deep down the ego knows it. The ego-mind needs to paint psychedelics as illegitimate. Then it's safe to play its spiritual games. A Buddhist can only keep being a Buddhist if he doesn't do enough psychedelics.

</p>

<p>
	So, for example, if you want to manifest a rock, not only would you have to imagine the rock as real for you, but you would also have to imagine that the rock is real for everyone else on Earth.
</p>

<p>
	That's easier said than done.
</p>

<p>
	And most people are not even open to such a possibility.

<p>
	Well, that's just a practical problem. How can a teacher recommend them if they are illegal in most places? This would get the teacher in trouble. It doesn't scale. And this assumes the teacher has lots of experience with them, which none of them do because they have been so tightly controlled and demonized.
</p>

<p>
	It's a catch-22. Teachers can't recommend them unless they become more widely available. And they can't become more widely available unless teachers recommend them. Thus it is a circle of ignorance. The only way to break that circle is with visionary leadership and by challenging authority, which is dangerous.

<p>
	Of course that's a huge factor.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics have the power to wake people up and melt down all socially constructed belief systems. As a result they are extremely dangerous and threatening to those in positions of power and authority. So they must be locked down and tightly controlled to maintain the illusion of society.
</p>

<p>
	If the US government did not crack down on the hippie psychedelic revolution of the 60's and early 70's, the people in power could not stay in power any longer. Which is why psychedelics are commonly demonized in all cultures. Christians demonized psychedelics and witchcraft because it was a threat to the authority of the corrupt church.
</p>

<p>
	Yogis do this too. If 5-MeO-DMT was widely available, yogis like Sadhguru would be out of business.
</p>

<p>
	Shrooms can make you super woke too. They are challenging though because they are very visionary and twisted.

<p>
	You have to understand that 5-MeO-DMT is not like any other psychedelic, and it was only discovered/synthesized in the last 50 years.
</p>

<p>
	So it's a cutting edge technology that no one knows about. No yogi knows about it.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe yoga is better than weed or datura. But it is not better than 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>
	Well, I don't want to be arrogant. So I hold out hope that some people are Awake. But most are not.
</p>

<p>
	I also don't claim to be Awake at all times. I merely claim to have accessed extraordinary levels of Awakening for short periods of time. So it's not like I'm better than anyone in any moral sense.

<p>
	Maybe some people can. But you ain't gonna generate 30mgs of it. Maybe a few milligrams. And even that is dubious.
</p>

<p>
	There's no solid evidence that you can generate 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>
	Exceptional people have naturally different neurotransmitters, giving them a "natural high".
</p>

<p>
	But even they have not reached the highest levels as you can reach on something like 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way a human being can naturally experience a state of consciousness as something like Salvia can produce. Just no way a sane person can do that, even with all the yoga and meditation in the world.

<p>
	Psychedelics and herbs have been used for over 50,000 years. It's just not advertised on CNN so you don't know about it.

<p>
	See my video series: Correcting The Stigma of Psychedelics. I put a lot of research into it.

</p>

<p>
	How can a creature have a robust immune system if it is never put to the test? And how can it be put to the test unless some people die?
</p>

<p>
	Do you want your children to be sickly weaklings? Then fight that virus!
</p>

<p>
	A thing cannot grow strong unless it encounters resistance.
</p>

<p>
	But see, if you were weak and sickly, you would complain, "Why God? Why did you make me so weak." And yet when God tries to make you strong by infecting you with a virus, you complain too. You complain in every case. That's the game you're playing.
</p>

<p>
	The virus is nicely showing the weaknesses of society as it is currently organized. The weakness of our political systems. So that your grandchildren could live in a stronger society with robust healthcare and economic systems. The healthcare and economic systems are not going to fix themselves without external pressure. Society evolves as a response to survival challenges. So here we are. Evolution is happening every day, through you! Your struggles are what makes evolution work. Which creates all of life.

	This gives you an idea of how there is no self/other and how consciousness works:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="morphing-01.gif" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed" data-fileid="22052" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_03/morphing-01.gif.a522ebe7b0d824a05c9749d11882cb40.gif" />
</p>

<p>
	You are THAT! Not any one person. You are the entire field of consciousness which generates the whole show. This field is highly intelligent and completely omnipotent in its creative power.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being so Awake that instead of seeing physical objects or people, you see the above AND you are aware of how you are doing that.
</p>

<p>
	Stare at that gif for a while and try to notice how there is no self there. Or, another way to put it is: there is only the ONE infinite Self which includes all possible finite limited selves.

<p>
	Because you are busy imagining the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	No matter what you imagine, you could always complain: "But why can't I have the opposite?! Why can't I flap my arms and not fly?!"
</p>

<p>
	So here you are. God pretending not to be God.
</p>

<p>
	You expext God to be some other way, but God is busy being precisely the way it is right now. You are always one step behind.
</p>

<p>
	To create the illusion of physical reality God had to make sure it couldn't just flap its arms and fly. That would not be physical reality, that would be some kind of dream world.  But if you were in this dream world you would complain that it doesn't feel solid enough, it doesn't feel real enough.
</p>

<p>
	The cost of things feeling "real" is not being able to change them on a whim.
</p>

<p>
	For Leo to feel real for you, you must be in denial that you are imagining Leo. If you knew for sure that you imagined Leo, then that would destroy the possibility of Leo being "real" for you. You'd know you are pretending. So the game you're playing is pretending that you are not pretending so that you can really pretend.
</p>

<p>
	It only differs in depth and breadth of understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Other gurus are not wrong, their understanding is just not as complete.
</p>

<p>
	There are higher and higher levels of completeness.
</p>

<p>
	It is similar to math or science. Euclid's geometry from 2000 years ago was not wrong, but it was also not as complete as our understanding of geometry today.

<p>
	What you're not conscious of is that from God's POV there's absolutely no difference between a child dying of cancer at age 5 vs that child living a healthy life till 100. From your biased, selfish POV there is a difference between these two outcomes. From God's POV there is no value judgments of any kind and therefore no difference whatsoever. God does not mind dying of cancer at 5 years old. Why would it matter if God is immortal and Perfect?
</p>

<p>
	You see the problem here? God loves itself absolutely. But you don't. Hence you think cancer is a problem. But God does not. If you had unconditional Love, you would not have a problem with cancer or premature death. The only reason you struggle with these things is because you are not conscious enough to love yourself. You are afraid of yourself. But God is not because it is fully conscious of itself to such a degree that no fear is possible.

			Okay, this is the most by far difficult stuff to grasp as our mind thinks in a liner way. When I start thinking of it, it gives me a headache. I can not grasp that time does not exist and never did, and that I will not be able exit from this reality it in the future with my death. Like I will be in this moment forever, or I have never been born. Well, I am okay with it, but what about yesterday? it felt so real, an hour ago was real. I can not understand this. I have a memory of walking outside an hour ago in my neighborhood. I can stomach that I have never been born, but I can not stomach that I have never walked outside an hour ago. I still remember the people I met on my path. This is crazy.  <img alt="O.o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/blink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/blink@2x.png 2x" title="O.o" width="20" />

<p>
	That's right. The logical mind cannot grasp it. It's far too radical.
</p>

<p>
	A change in your state of consciousness is required to understand what I'm saying.

<p>
	That's an even bigger mindfuck. Because God is absolute Perfection and God has no choice but to be Perfect, Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	God cannot not be God. God cannot say, "I don't like diseases so I will stop them". Because God is precisely what is. How can God remove a disease when God IS the disease? God cannot destroy itself because destruction is God too! Since God is Infinite, it is EVERYTHING, and therefore cannot be otherwise and cannot be different.
</p>

<p>
	When you think a disease is a sign of imperfection, that's merely because you lack the consciousness to see its absolute Perfection. Only God is able to understand its own Perfection. You have to be God to understand that God is Absolutely Perfect. A human cannot understand God's Perfection because the Perfection is infinite.

<p>
	Again, this is the mindfuck: nothing happens when Leo dies because death is imaginary! LOL
</p>

<p>
	You are not realizing how radical "the NOW moment is all there is" is. It's so radical that there literally isn't a future, and hence no possibility of dying in the future. You literally can't die if you are conscious that the future is imaginary!

<p>
	It will not look like anything because it will not happen! You are imagining Leo's death. Stop doing that.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that in order to engage in this mental speculation your mind has to project into the future. Your mind is literally creating the future as you ask these confusing philosophical questions. And so you get yourself trapped in illusions.
</p>

<p>
	When you wonder, "But what will happen from Leo's POV when his body dies" you are literally creating the possibility of Leo, his body, and it's death. But you aren't conscious of what you're doing. You're taking it all for granted, as if Leo, his body, and its death were real.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's more twisted than that. I have existed in this moment for Eternity. As God. Leo is just some idea God overlays on top of the present moment. Like putting on a mask. There is no reason why you could not pretend right now that you are Leo. That would be as true as me pretending to be Leo. Leo is an imaginary thing. You could imagine you are Leo, or Arnold, or Trump, or Jesus. These are all just masks God can wear. But right now you're too busy wearing your personal mask because you think it is real and true. You think that you cannot be Jesus because that wouldn't be true. But that assumes there is a true mask. But all masks are imaginary. You can pretend to be Jesus from this day forth and it will be as true as the actual Jesus. Since "the actual Jesus" has never been anything more than your imagination!
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is that you're still assuming the existence of a past. Notice how you say, "before Leo life-time". That assumes a past which is real. But the "before Leo life-time" is something you are imagining right now! You are creating the past by imagining it. There never was a "before Leo life-time" and there will never be an after Leo life-time. That is, unless you imagine it to be so. If I start imagining that I'm a kangaroo, then that will be who I am at that moment. If I stop imagining altogether, then I will be Nothing/Formless.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine you had a past life, that becomes true for you. But when you Awaken you realize all of that was imagination at play and none of it was anything solid.

			I've had some awakenings and realizations but I want to see if they correlate to what you're saying. Are you conscious of previous lives? If they exist you could be interacting with yourself from previous lives because time doesn't exist. You know that you're conscious and I know that I'm conscious, both are right, what you are experiencing now is the god head, and what I'm experiencing now is the god head. The only difference is the god head can only experience itself one at a time, and the previous lives are the distinction. Basically what I am saying is that from every single persons perspective, they are conscious, but because time doesn't exist everyone sees themselves as the god head and no one is wrong, because you're just interacting with yourself from previous lives.
		</p>

<p>
	I have become conscious that there is no such thing as lives, past or present.
</p>

<p>
	Past lives are imaginary.

		</p>

		<p>
			But how can you say that the one consciousness that is choosing to express or project itself as them, is also imaginary? Isn't consciousness the only thing that is real?  Isn't the one consciousness the ultimate real player of the entire video game, in all of its limited dualistic forms that it is deciding to temporarily project itself as? Please explain.

<p>
	When did I say that consciousness is imaginary? I never said that.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the one substance of reality. Consciousness imagines all things. But that doesn't mean consciousness itself is imagined.

<p>
	Psychedelics are not about escaping the present. They are about accessing higher consciousness than humanly possible.
</p>

<p>
	You will never, ever naturally access the kind of consciousness that 5-MeO-DMT can give you. Not even with 40 years of practice.

<p>
	Awakening is such a radical thing that you simply cannot treat it like any other domain of human knowledge. It is not knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine becoming God, becoming conscious of how time, space, Earth, the body, life, death, and mathematics was invented. Imagine you become conscious of how you designed Hitler. That's what we're talking about. It is not a human function at all. Your life as a human comes to an end.
</p>

<p>
	It comes from pure consciousness. Where does the fact that you exist come from?

<p>
	That's the ultimate mindfuck: there is no death, there is no end. You are imagining an end. This moment and this room are Eternal and exist forever.

<p>
	Death is just complete Awakening and dissolution into Infinite Love for forever. It is not blankness or void. It is Total Awakeness forever.

	I am speaking of a level of Awakening which is outside your ability to imagine, understand, or comprehend.
</p>

<p>
	But if you don't want to go there, that's okay. I will not push you any further.

<p>
	Yup, indeed psychedelics are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You got it! Good work!
</p>

<p>
	But now you need to take some real psychedelics to go deeper <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

	My perspectives on Awakening changed a lot in the last month. I will explain more in new videos.

			Obviously you're saying everything is imaginary. My question to you is, by using difference phrasing, is the chakra system fictional? Does it actually exist? i.e. is real in the same way this "table" in front of me is real, like it's an existing structure. I've had strong experiences with my third eye having sensations, or if I'm doing spinal breathing I will interpret there to be energy spots on my spine. What makes this tricky however is the fact this spinal breathing is a visualisation exercise of imagining prana moving up the spine, so my mind can be seeing what it wants to see or my mind rather will change my bodily sensations to match my visualisations ( I need to experiment with this a lot more than I currently am). <br />
			<br />
			So does this structure called the chakra system exist? If it is true that (adding the phrase "If it is true that" because I don't want to pretend like I've directly experienced this) I imagine my nervous system to have an impact on my consciousness. The spine being a part of the nervous system, it is of energetic significance? I'm not ultimately concerned with rationalising it as nervous system or as this or that tbh, I'm just curious what you think about this entire concept of chakra system.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To me it's obvious that chakras are imaginary. BUT! So is the Earth. So... just because it is imaginary doesn't mean you can't use it. The whole point of yoga is to imagine those things and use that to prop yourself up. So I'm not saying it doesn't work.

<p>
	Contemplate this: what is the difference between me being real vs you imagining me?

<p>
	That difference itself has no ground.

<p>
	There is absolutely zero difference between anything, unless you imagine otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	It's far more radical than you guys are thinking. You are still treating Awakening as solipsism. It is not! It is God! And what is God? You don't know since you ain't Awake yet.

<p>
	Awakening is not a theory.
</p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	It's not merely that materialism can't explain things. It's fundamentally a total delusion.
</p>

<p>
	You were never born and science is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Not as a theory. Actually!
</p>

<p>
	Your birth is the theory.
</p>

<p>
	Open your mind to the possibilty of direct access to Absolute Truth.

<p>
	Yes, they can help a lot.
</p>

<p>
	But they will not automagically still your mind. That requires years of training.
</p>

<p>
	But a psychedelic will definitely put you into a effortless yet temporary state of samadhi. This is the whole point of psychedelics. They make samadhi accessible to anyone within 10 to 20 mins. Zero training required.

	That's the whole trick, I think. You become so conscious that you can blur those lines at will.

<p>
	If we are talking about manifestation of physical objects, then your friend should be able to see it. Or at least you will imagine that he does. Since your friend is imaginary to begin with.

<p>
	Truth does not depend on my authority or word. It's right there before your eyes. Why are you asking me instead of looking with your eyes? I am less reliable than your eyes. I could be lying to you, but your eyes are showing you Absolutely what is the case.

			This increasingly makes sense to me because of psychedelic experiences and understanding sciences like qp and neuroscience. But there’s one thing that I struggle with most and can’t seem to reconcile: if I fly over to Vegas and actually stab you in the eye, you’ll report your subjective experience. Yet you say that I’m just imagining some body with a mind (which is a concept on top of the body’s visual appearance). So that subjectivity that you report to me; all the awakenings that you have, I don’t have access to any of it. So what <i>is that?</i>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Other isn't real! Self isn't real either. Subjectivity isn't real either. Everything you see, is Absolute Truth. There is nothing but Absolute Truth. The ego mind has simply mistaken it for a human experience. You need to play this game otherwise you cannot be a human.
</p>

<p>
	The way God becomes human is by imagining that it is having a subjective experience and others are too.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental problem is that you imagine that you were ever born as a human. That's a fiction. You were not born. You've always been this moment now.
</p>

<p>
	It's a mindfuck.

			I talk here from limited human form perspective in this relative world:  what is when two imaginated people look at the coffee table at the same time, the one from the frontside the other from the backside, the coffee table has then a backside in this moment because one of them is aware of the backside. Correct?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, not correct.
</p>

<p>
	You're imagining people, self, other, and the other's mind.
</p>

<p>
	There is only you looking at the coffee table and imagining the other looking at it. In this case, the coffee table still only has one side.
</p>

<p>
	If you ask the other person to describe another side of the coffee table, you will hear some words, but the coffee table will still only have one side.
</p>

<p>
	To be even more precisely, there is not even a "you" looking at the side of a coffee table. There is only the side of the coffee table without a "you" who is "looking". "You" and "looking" are already an illusions of the ego.

<p>
	But it DOES exist for you because you're imagining viruses, atoms, molecules, immune systems, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Imagination is extremely complex. It's as complex as reality itself. You don't have to literally see a virus for it to affect you because it affects you in many ways besides through vision.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is nothing behind the scene. Ask yourself why a behind the scene is necessary? It's totally extraneous. Everything that exists is PRECISELY what it appears.

			So a coffee table has a backside because god is omniscient and created this 3D space time object called coffee table and has full access to every little detail (atoms, structure, energy, spirit whatever).. But when I as an imagined person look at a coffee table, I (not God) just imagine the backside of a coffee table. Because I dont have access to the backside of the coffee table with my eyes (I would if I could have x-ray vision).
		</p>

		<p>
			But in fact the backside of a coffee table is still there thanks to God who is omniscient.  Did I understood you correctly? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	You are still in the trap of imagining God as some other magical thing somewhere behind the scene, holding stuff in his mind but only revealing parts of it to you.
</p>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	There is no behind the scene! This is all there is! What you see is the whole universe right now.
</p>

<p>
	If you only see one side, the coffee table only has one side. If you were to see 10 sides, that's how many sides a coffee table would have at that moment in time.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that you don't have access to the backside of the table. It's that you have access to the fact that there is no backside, only the side you're seeing. That's what is. That's Absolute Truth. The rest is thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	You are God. God sees precisely whatever you see. Nothing more!

<p>
	It's a common dogma floating around in the spiritual community.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to take into account is that most spiritual people do not think or investigate anything independently for themselves. They adopt spiritual beliefs which they then justify with a few mystical experiences.

<p>
	Yes, you will imagine it to be so, and so it will appear to you.

<p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Obviously you're imagining my body and my pain.
</p>

<p>
	What's less obvious is that you are also imagining your body. If you pay close attention you can notice that right now you are imagining your heart. You have no heart until we cut your chest open, at which point you will imagine a heart there, and it will appear. << This is what we call reality.
</p>

<p>
	And thus the illusion of reality is created. You imagine everything at precisely the moment it is needed to render the illusion. A video game engine does not render anything other than those pixels necessary to create the current frame.
</p>

<p>
	Why would God waste its time creating things it cannot see?? In fact, the problem runs even deeper: it is impossible for God to do that because God is omniscient. So God cannot hide from its own awareness. Anything God creates must be fully accessible to it at all times. If a coffee table had a backside, God would have to be aware of it. So if God wants to see a coffee table from one angle, it must create only that face of the coffee table and nothing else.

			As for the guys bothering you including Leo; You come off as rather annoying and immature in your responses. She said she wants to stop and take a long break. Piss off and stop pestering her to snort more drugs. Accept where she is at.

<p>
	It's not about pestering her to do more drugs.
</p>

<p>
	It's about helping her to keep an open mind about future experiences.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people fall into the trap of dipping their toe in the ocean and thinking "That's it, I don't need to explore the ocean any more. I understand ocean now." Which is a shame. It's a self-deception.

	That Alan Watts quotes is so misused. Alan Watts was not Awake.

<p>
	You're not going to acheive emotional mastery without some degree of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional mastery is probably the hardest thing to achieve.
