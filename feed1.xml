<title>Meditation styles effective for ADD</title>

<p>
	Psychedelics + Nootropics + Kriya yoga
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is very effective at shutting down the monkey mind through brute physical force.
</p>

<p>
	Also, if you have the money, EEG neurofeedback training. You can find a center near you that offers hourly sessions. It's great for ADD. Just 5 to 15 sessions can make a lasting impact.
</p>

<title>Looking For PHP Web Developer</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/27470-looking-for-php-web-developer/?do=findComment&amp;comment=312629</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I'm looking for a fairly experienced web developer with good working knowledge of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. And as a bonus, experience with Wordpress backend, shopping carts, and Paypal backend integration would be really nice.
</p>

<p>
	I have a few improvements that I want made to the Actualized.org website, like an improved search function, and we need to create a registration page for the upcoming Actualized tour -- which needs to be hooked up to Paypal payment processing and a custom database -- and some other additions to the shopping cart.
</p>

<p>
	This would be a part-time, semi-paid volunteer gig. You could add Actualized.org to your resume/portfolio. I could also give you free access to all current & future Actualized products/courses, or maybe even some one-on-one life coaching if you want.
</p>

<p>
	PM me if you're interested. Let me know what kind of experience you have and where you are located. I only need one person.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks!
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not impossible.
</p>

<p>
	That's where spiritual work is needed.
</p>

<p>
	Being is far superior to meaning. The pursuit of meaning never satisfies because it's like a donkey moving towards a carrot on stick that it will never ever reach.
</p>

<p>
	This is very important for you to grok if you ever want to be truly happy.
</p>

<p>
	JP's ideology will NEVER lead to happiness. And you can tell it makes him miserable. It's visible in his demeanor. Compare him, say, to someone like Eckhart Tolle or Sadhguru and you can see the vast difference.
</p>

Suffering actually comes from the construction and chasing of meaning. Because in the end the Truth will win out and all meaning will be rendered meaningless. Because in Truth, being is meaningless.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful not to fall into the naive trap of assigning negative meaning to meaninglessness.
</p>

<p>
	JP is deluded, and if you keep listening to him he will infect you with his gross misunderstandings of reality.
</p>

<p>
	It is fine to pursue meaning in a relative sense as long as you understand that all meaning is just a game that you are playing to amuse yourself. You cannot take meaning or value seriously, otherwise you will suffer greatly and become deluded.
</p>

<p>
	For example I pursue meaning by doing my work. But I also understand that my work is ultimately meaningless and that it's just done for fun. I don't take it too seriously.
</p>

<p>
	One of the things you should immediately notice about JP is that he takes himself way too seriously. And you better believe this causes him great suffering. You don't want to be JP.
</p>

<p>
	Value & meaning are the survival mechanism of the ego.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, meaning & value are relative. Which means you can literally make it anything you want to be. It's imagination and fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Guys, enough of this stupid question/response.
</p>

<p>
	You have to speak to people at their level. Just telling some newbie "Who is doing X?" when the person is clearly not in a position to understand what you mean is the very definition of unskillful means.
</p>

<p>
	A teaching only works when the other person is at a place where they will get it.

</p>

<p>
	The cure for bad trips is 1) Learn the lesson it was trying to teach you, 2) Let a few months pass, 3) Then try a different substance to clean your palette.
</p>

<p>
	Only then return to the original substance.
</p>

<p>
	By this point your trip will go very differently. You will be much more mature.

<title>US midterm election results</title>

<p>
	Regardless, Kavanaugh is definitely a liar and an ideologue. Which should be enough to disqualify him from a Supreme Court position.
</p>

<p>
	It would be good if no partisan or ideologue was ever allowed to even apply for that job. The most important requirement for a judge is to be non-biased. That judges are liberal or conservative is silly. Judges must be neutral and openminded. But of course, that would de facto make them rather liberal, which conservatives would never abide.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is that openmindedness is not acceptable to conservatives. Their entire philosophy is based on closedmindedness. Which is why self-actualization and conservativism are like oil and water and not just my personal political bias. Conservatives are neurologically wired to be more closedminded, as studies seem to show. Which doesn't mean they are always wrong but let's just say they fall more on the losing side of history, like dodo birds.
</p>

<p>
	As Socrates famously said, "I know that I know nothing."
</p>

<p>
	That's enlightenment in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
	But it's still not what you imagine it to be. By knowing nothing you know everything. Things go full-circle in an unexpected way.
</p>

<p>
	You should also distinguish carefully between absolute vs relative knowing. We are talking about knowledge of the Absolute Truth in this context. Relative knowledge abounds, but it is relative.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute knowledge isn't really knowledge, it's Being. But we colloquially call it "knowledge" because most people do not understand a word like "being".
</p>

<p>
	Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	That's why I keep saying you must hone an genuine desire for TRUTH! Not pleasure or joy, but TRUTH at all costs!
</p>

<p>
	There will be terror.
</p>

<p>
	The joy comes afterwards.
</p>

<p>
	If TRUTH was so easily enjoyable, every fool would have found it by now. The trick is precisely that the greatest joy lies behind a veil of your greatest fears: death & insanity. You must have enough wisdom and vision to confront your greatest fears, intuiting that they are merely paper tigers.
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to realize God without dying.
</p>

<p>
	A bigger dose of psychedelics helps here. A dose so big that you have no choice but to surrender. But not so big that you physically harm yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Time is relative. Everything exists simultaneously from a high enough elevation.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, every experience exists eternally, forever. Including this one right now. Here it is! Eternal!
</p>

<p>
	But you're stuck in relativity so you aren't aware of the eternity. See, that's what happens when your mind gets attached to particular forms.

<p>
	Of course Spinoza knew what's up.
</p>

<p>
	He was a Western mystic. Apparently a hero of Einstein's.
</p>

<p>
	Check out Bishop George Berkeley too.

</p>

<p>
	The navel chakra stores the largest reserve of kundalini energy. Which is why the navel chakra is often stimulated only after lots of prep work -- because when it opens it could unleash a torrent.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you would get a lot of out of Kriya yoga. It should be very effective for you. Much more so than conventional meditation. Give it a try for 6 months. You could awaken just like that. It could change your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	Don't depend on other people to awaken you. Take the job into your own hands. Which is not to say never do Reiki, I just mean, seize this lucky break to awaken yourself.
</p>

<p>
	I have some books about kundalini on my book list. Make sure you educate yourself about some of the dangers of kundalini and how to awaken it gradually and properly. Otherwise you might run into problems.

<p>
	Because every trip builds on the prior. Those first few trips were merely laying the groundwork for the mindfuckery that is to come in the future.
</p>

<p>
	In the future you will experience recontextualizations so radical that you will not be able to tell if were ever born. You ain't seen nothing yet. So watch your step.
</p>

<p>
	See, the arrogant ego just stumbles into this stuff thinking that it's a joke. Then it catches one tiny glimpse of Truth and it runs crying for Mommy. You just can't appreciate yet how radical this work is and how deep the rabbit hole goes. The only way you can know is by getting mindfucked.

<title>Osho - Unknowable Intrinsic Reality</title>

<p>
	That is the core lesson of mysticism: reality is irreducibly mystical.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot know the Absolute because knowledge is a 2nd order process. Being is prior to knowing. You can BE the Absolute rather than knowing it. Or you can know that it is unknowable. Which is what Osho is describing.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality means that knowing must collapse into being. Which is why the ultimate Truth cannot be spoke, thought, or symbolized. All symbols are too indirect. You must directly become the being of which all symbols are made. Language and thought must be entirely transcended. The Truth is beyond thought, imagination, or even your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Ayn Rand was of course an arrogant, egoistical, dualistic, stage Orange fool. The hallmark of the ego-mind is that it thinks it can know everything through linear reason. And in this it is deluded beyond hope.

</p>

<p>
	From now on, when you trip you will do it with seriousness, good intent, focus, and no more willy-nilly stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are not a toy.
</p>

<p>
	When you take a psychedelic properly, you set aside the whole day, mentally prepare yourself, and you do it almost like a religious ceremony (minus the dogma).
</p>

<p>
	Why are you drinking during a psychedelic trip?
</p>

<p>
	Why are you tripping while tired?
</p>

<p>
	Why are you trying to avoid the trip through sleep?
</p>

<p>
	This shows sloppy protocol and disrespect for the substance.
</p>

<p>
	When you take a psychedelic you must in peak form: alert, awake, focused, sober, solemn, at peace, in a positive mood, well-rested, empty stomach, reverent, slightly apprehensive, and ready to be mindfucked.
</p>

<title>Differentiation within Pure Beingness</title>

</p>

<p>
	You are assuming there is a material difference between something and nothing, when there isn't from the absolute perspective.
</p>

<p>
	What you're calling "differentiation" is otherwise called a distinction. Distinction is NOT a concept! But concept is a distinction!
</p>

<p>
	All of reality consists of distinctions, but at the same time all distinctions are ultimately one.
</p>

<p>
	This was explained in my longest episode: Understanding Sameness vs Difference
</p>

<p>
	Pure beingness is literally nothing whether you drop your concepts or not. Nothing has ever happened. That's reality. Nothing. And everything. Because there is no difference between the two. The difference is only there in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The implications of this are not only important, it is the source of all Creation! This is how God created the entire universe!
</p>

<p>
	If you understood what a distinction was, you'd be deeply enlightened and you'd understand how the entire universe came into being. So it's worth contemplating a bit <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	P.S. You would also become immortal as the distinction between life and death would collapse.
</p>

<p>
	P.P.S. An object which lacks all distinction is Infinity. And yet at the same time this object contains within it all possible distinctions, thus comprising the sum total of reality. Nothing and Everything in one tiny/huge point. A white hole if you will.
</p>

<p>

	By definition God is all. So asking the question: Is thing X God? is pointless because the answer will always be YES regardless of what X is.

<p>
	If you have a problem paying for spiritual teachings, you don't understand how money works and you've got your priorities backwards.
</p>

<p>
	If spirituality is the most important and difficult thing in life you should be willing to pay the most money for it.

<p>
	Democrats had a fairly strong win.
</p>

<p>
	The Senate was never really in play this term.
</p>

<p>
	Red states are still red, and they will not change much in 2 years time. Conservatives like Trump so they will not change. The only thing that really changes is independents and moderates, and they seem to be turned off by Trump, which is about as much as you can expect.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really expect deep red states to flip all of the sudden. Texas and Florida are red and will stay red for a years to come.
</p>

<p>
	From what I can see Trump will find it almost impossible to win reelection in 2020 because he has clearly lost independents and moderates. He only won thanks to them in 2016 because they did not yet realize his true character and Hillary didn't inspire anyone and had lots of baggage.
</p>

<p>
	If the Dems put up a good candidate in 2020, Trump should easily lose, assuming he even survives 2 years of criminal investigations.
</p>

<p>
	The only way Trump wins again is if the Dems put up a terrible, uninspiring candidate. (Which they could manage to do.)
</p>

<p>
	If the Dems put up someone like Sanders, Warren, or Beto, Trump should lose.
</p>

<p>
	If they put up Biden...

	There is no need to close your eyes.
</p>

<p>
	You will get more out of the trip with eyes open. Otherwise it will tend to devolve into just another dream.

<p>
	The point is to let the psychedelic transform your everyday perceptions. So keep your room as it is. Don't make it dark or special.

<p>
	That's doable. Although San Diego is a pretty reasonable drive from LA.

<p>
	Why do you have no problem with source needing you to spend thousands of $$$ to feed it self?
</p>

<p>
	By your logic shouldn't God hand out free slices of pizza to homeless people? And while we're at it why not a free Rolls Royce too? After all, source wouldn't want people to have to get places using their legs. That might produce blisters. And everyone knows driving a Kia is just embarrassing.

	Shakipat is a classic awakening method. But it's not gonna work on everyone and like all methods it has its pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you can shortcut the hard work of inner development, you'll probably be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that awakening ain't development, and development ain't awakening.

I understand that you may not want to rely on random forum people, but very least, I could help come up with and organize a suitable venue, if it ever comes to the European tour and you consider my city :).

<p>

	Enlightenment will be the death of "you". After that, there is nothing left to die.

</p>

<p>
	The ticket price makes up only a portion of the total of the travel expenses. And for this tour, the tickets have to be at specific hours. Budget red-eye flights with long layovers will not work. I can't arrive dead tired. I have to be fresh enough to speak and lead a group.

</p>

<p>
	What you're looking for is nonduality. Or maybe some kind of meditative yoga center. Not Hatha yoga but serious Indian meditative yoga like Kundalini yoga, Kriya yoga, etc.
</p>

<p>
	In Vegas we have a pretty good Indian yoga center. But that will vary a lot city to city.
</p>

<p>
	Usually you have to travel to find good nondual teachers. Isn't Rupert Spira in the UK? That might be your best bet. I've traveled to far away places to seek out the best teachers. It is worth it.
</p>

<p>
	In the old days folks would fly to India.
</p>

<p>
	Also Sadhguru has yoga initiations in London I'm sure. Maybe even Ireland.

<p>
	That's a good question. I imagine my talks will be in the vein of Actualized.org videos. With some new helpful in-person group exercises which would be focused on raising general consciousness & self awareness. This would be useful for all people across the board, basically delving you into consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	I don't think we'd directly work on life purpose, but consciousness work will help with all your goals, from career to relationships to spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	We would probably be exploring topics like emotional mastery, fear, judgment, confidence, self-esteem, self-deception, spirituality, meditation techniques, body awareness, nonduality, shadow work, motivation, getting unstuck, etc.

<p>
	The dates will be set and announced long ahead of time so that people can be mobilized to sign up.
</p>

<p>
	You would have to sign up online and submit payment ($30) to reserve your spot. Otherwise many people will flake. And also because I need to know how big of a meeting room to book. Every room has a max occupancy which is commonly 15, 20, 30, or 40 people.
</p>

<p>
	If I'm flying out there, you gotta show up. It costs at least $500-$700 to fly out to even nearby cities.

	Vancouver is possible. Maybe Toronto if there is enough demand.

<p>
	You cannot invalidate Truth. That's the trick!
</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Nothing the materialist can do will undermined nonduality. In fact, the entire universe could explode tomorrow and nonduality would still hold.
</p>

<p>
	That's the value of nonduality. It's FOREVER! If it could be undermined by some silly materialist's scientific discovery it wouldn't be worth talking about.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot apply relativistic standards of falsification to the Absolute!
</p>

<p>
	You can discover the Absolute for yourself. But you cannot ever falsify it. Because it is true, absolutely.
</p>

<p>
	So I've decided to give this tour a shot. The details are still yet to be determined but tentatively I'm hoping to visit about 10 cities in the next year around the US.
</p>

<p>
	This tour would happen in 3 phases:
</p>

<p>
	Phase #1: Los Angeles, San Fran, Seattle<br />
	Phase #2: Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago, NY<br />
	Phase #3: Austin, Atlanta, Miami
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps not in exactly that order, but something akin to that. We will adjust cities based on demand. But Phase #1 seems fairly certain to happen in that order.
</p>

<p>
	It would work as follows:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I would fly into the city on Friday
	</li>
	<li>
		Around 6-7pm on Friday we would meet in a hotel conference room where I would give a talk on some new topic followed by some group exercises and Q&A.
	</li>
	<li>
		This would all last about 2-3 hrs long in total, with about 10-30 people attending (depending on demand).
	</li>
	<li>
		This would perhaps be followed by a dinner at a local eatery, depending on crowd size. Probably limited to 10 people max as it gets unwieldy with a party over 10.
	</li>
	<li>
		Cost: estimated around $30/person
	</li>
	<li>
		Cost of attending dinner: some amount just to keep the group to 10 max + you pay for your dinner
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I would visit at least 1 city per month, maybe as much as 1 city every 2 weeks. The schedule would vary to avoid conflict with holidays but the meetings would be held on Friday evenings.
</p>

<p>
	Locations outside USA are too cost and time prohibitive right now. Europe might be possible if and when Phase #3 is successfully completed, but that's too early to talk about yet.
</p>

<p>
	I'm doing this in phases because I have no idea yet how many people would show up in which cities. If fewer than 10, it's not really worth doing due to the expenses of travel, hotel, meeting room, car, and time. 10-30 would be ideal for now. More than 30 requires larger, more expensive meeting rooms but I doubt we'll have this problem at this stage.
</p>

<p>
	If there is interest I might also design a one-day mini-workshop which I would teach on the following day: Saturday. With the idea being that if you like the Friday talk and you want to do a more in-depth training the following day, that might cost $100-$200 for let's say a 4-hour training. This extra mini-workshop day would help cover my costs of travel and it would be a good learning experience for you. But for the mini-workshop to be practical there would have to be at least 5 people paying. Otherwise it's not worth the hassle.
</p>

<p>
	The trick in planning this out is that I have no idea how many people would be interested in this in each of the above cities, let alone show up. The only way to find out is to actually schedule the dates and do it. So I will probably be making concrete plans shortly for Los Angeles, San Fran, & Seattle. After those 3 are complete we could assess how things went, make improvements, and schedule new cities. Or, if not enough people show up, then Phase #1 will be the end of this experiment.
</p>

<p>
	Let me know what ya'll think.
</p>

<p>
	This would probably only work if those who want to attend can convince 1 or 2 friends to come as well.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest benefits of these meet ups would be the ability to network and make friends with self-actualizers in your city. So you don't just get to meet me, but you get to make some new local friends who are into this work who you can hang out with for years to come.
</p>

<p>
	I'm excited to do some talking and socializing in the non-digital realm <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

			Does Leo take all of the nootropics mentioned in his video simultaneously? Like at any one time, how many nootropics is it appropriate to be on? Are there any long term benefits to modafanil/armodafanil? Or are these two drugs only good for the period of time that you are on them?

<p>
	It's certainly possible to take 20 pills at once. I don't do that every day but some days I do. Depends on what I'm planning to do and what I'm in the mood for. Most days I take a smaller batch of like 6-10 essential pills. As you experiment you will discover which ones are most essential for you.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if I'm going to be doing a long day of creative intellectual work I might take the full 20 pill stack. But for most days that's overkill. I'm not gonna take that on a weekend when I'm just chilling.

This you will do for years. And at the same time you want to have 2-4 things you are working on in your life using the various techniques and practices we talk about.
</p>

<p>
	Like meditation, contemplation, psychedelics, journaling, working on your career, working on your diet, visualization, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Start with those things which are giving you the most problem, which are keeping you stuck the most.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to do everything at once. Come up with a list of your priorities. Something like: #1 career, #2 diet, #3 relationships, or whatever. It's hard to do personal dev in the abstract. You need to have some concrete goals that you're working towards, whether it's getting a girlfriend or starting a profitable biz or having your first mystical experience. Those are all concrete goals you can work towards every day using various practices.
</p>

<p>
	What are the top 3 ways in which you want to change your life? Start there.

So obviously it only exists for you, in your mind. The coffee table must be entangled with your mind otherwise your blinking would not alter it in any way.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not the coffee table how is it possible that you perceieve it?
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps a better question for you to ponder is: prove that you are a body.

<p>
	Yellow is about exploring lots of different POVs.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect any Yellow news sources. Too early in our evolution for that. It doesn't sell and it cannot become mainstream or popular yet.

<title>Spiral Dynamics (Worldview) Questionnaire Test</title>

<p>
	If you were at stage Blue or Orange, for example, you would not pick higher stage values because you know they are "right" because the whole point of being at a stage is that you think that stage is right.
</p>

<p>
	A Blue person will resonate with traditional values no matter how much you tell him that dogma, conformity, ideology, and ethnocentrism are not "right". That's what it means to be at Blue.
</p>

<p>
	And likewise for the other stages.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really fake your stage. Whatever you resonate with or gravitate towards genuinely is what defines your stage. If you genuinely gravitate towards integrating many perspectives from across the world then that by definition makes you as least Greenish, if not Yellowish.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you probably still have lots of work to do to fully exhaust and transcend Orange. There is a big difference between dabbling in a stage vs fully mastering and realizing a stage's limitations. A lot of people can dabble in Green & Yellow without having fully exhausted Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever stage you are at, you also have 25% of the stage below it, and 25% of the stage above it.
</p>

<p>
	So if you feel you are Orange, you probably have 25% Blue and 25% Green. That's what being Orange really means. It does not mean you are 100% Orange but only 50% Orange. Likewise, the typical Green person has 25% Orange and 25% Yellow. And so on. Almost no body is solidly one color. Don't expect people or collectives to be 100% anything.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The more you do the work more no-mind you will experience. At first it will be only seconds at a time, but with more practice it will turn into minutes, and then hours.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is very good for attaining no-mind. It will speed up your progess a lot.
</p>

<p>
	You can also specifically train mindfulness during busy work. Start by doing walking meditation. The try to meditate while driving, while doing the dishes, while out in public, and even inside of conversations. All of this will take a few years at least.
</p>

<p>
	Attaining stable no-mind is not easy at all. It is a very advanced stage of practice and I am certaibly not there after 5 years of meditation and other kinds of work.
</p>

<p>
	But I am getting closer. Just lately I made a significant step towards no-mind and I can see that it will come with years more of practice.
</p>

<p>
	It's worth the work.
</p>

<p>
	1) It is especially important to emphasize that identity is relative because people generally believe identity is a physical fact. Like, a cat is a cat. No, a cat is a cat only TO YOU. The universe at large draws no such distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	And very importantly that means that your identity as a human being is relative. It is not absolutely true.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, if you truly understood that everything is relative you would also understand that identity is relative, but it helps to emphasize the point.
</p>

<p>
	2) All Actualized.org videos are basically about dialing in your inner game.

<p>
	Being mean is just being an egoic dick.

<p>
	There is a big difference between the rate at which people who follow Actualized.org grow and the general population.
</p>

<p>
	If you watch me and you do many of the techniques I talk about you will grow by a stage every 2 years or so. But his Orange friends aren't doing that. They don't even know about Spiral Dynamics and they don't care about what Actualized.org teaches.
</p>

<p>
	Just to be interested in Actualized.org you must already be a pretty rare type of person.

<p>
	5-MeO basically has no tolerance so you could do back to back doses.
</p>

<p>
	The real issue is whether you'd actually want to redose.
</p>

<p>
	10mg is a good starting dose for snorting/plugging.
</p>

<p>
	5mg is too little unless you are smoking it.
</p>

<p>
	10mg snorted will freak you out enough that you probably won't want to redose that day. Even 10mg if its your first time can be very shocking.
</p>

<p>
	For me 5-MeO trips tend to be so deep that I would never want to redose same day.
</p>

<p>
	I would plan it like this:
</p>

<p>
	Day 1: 10-12mg
</p>

<p>
	Day 2: 15-20mg
</p>

<p>
	Day 3: 25mg
</p>

<p>
	A week later: 30mg
</p>

<p>
	Even that will be emotionally challenging to pull off.
</p>

<p>
	After my 30mg dose I didn't want to do 5-MeO for a whole year. That's how strong it is. I still have no desire to do a 30mg dose.
</p>

<p>
	At 30mg your life as a human being is over.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Have you been working too hard? Sounds like you might need to slow things down and take more time for yourself, for fun. When doing highly creative work you need some outlets for breaks and diversion to recharge your batteries.
</p>

<p>
	Like take a small vacation every 90 days.

<p>
	Try making at least one new friend who is beyond stage Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Then compare and see if you want more of that.
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty important to make at least one Yellow/Turquoise friend.
</p>

<p>
	You won't really be able to drag an Orange person higher. They have to evolve into it on their own, and I wouldn't count on it happening for at least 10 years. And even then, Green is not that advanced.

<p>
	There is value in talking about it so as to point out all the traps, explain the techniques, clear up egoic confusion, and inspire/motivate people into action.
</p>

<p>
	But philosophizing, speculating, or debating about nonduality is counter-productive.

<p>
	Predetermined vs not predetermined is just another duality.
</p>

<p>
	All of that collapses in the end. It is mystical.
</p>

<p>
	Since you are God, every action you take is basically an act of God. Whatever you end up doing is God's unfoldment -- what God is. And God is EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really make sense to ask "Who did X?" because there is only one thing in existence ultimately: YOU/Consciousness/God/Reality

<p>
	Hard to say if LSD will resolve your headaches, but it will certainly result in spiritual purification. LSD is an awesome substance. Dare I say, better than mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try Shamanic Breathing as described in my video. That's a very powerful therapeutic technique.
</p>

<p>
	Don't trip on LSD or mushrooms more than once very 2 weeks. Otherwise tolerance. Plus you want to fully integrate your trips which usually requires at least a week or two. If you trip too often without enough integration you will likely start to experience some bad trips which will scare you away from psychedelics forever.
</p>

<p>
	The best strategy is to trip gradually but consistently over long periods of time. The trips will build on themselves and you will keep growing and growing in depth.
</p>

<title>Greek Gods &amp; Nonduality?</title>

<p>
	You can basically think of the Greek gods as the Hindu gods.
</p>

<p>
	Shiva = Zeus = God
</p>

<p>
	That's the big nondual daddy. The godhead.
</p>

<p>
	And then you got all kinds of other lesser gods.
</p>

<p>
	There's really no contradiction.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics actually also parallel this structure.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO = Zeus
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms, AL-LAD, DMT, etc. are the lesser gods.
</p>

	I haven't used it, but it's not a serious EEG device.

<p>
	A solid EEG costs $2-3k with all the important software and accessories.

<p>
	There is a much more fundamental problem here: how does anything work?
</p>

<p>
	Like seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Like what is your explanation for why you don't fall through the floor of your room?
</p>

<p>
	Think about it.
</p>

<p>
	What is an explanatory framework at all? And how much does it really explain?
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality reveals that all the workings of the universe are spontaneously self-manifesting beyond explanation. Or, in other words: the universe is fundamentally, irreducibly mystical, or mysterious.
</p>

<p>
	At rock bottom everything is consciousness and consciousness interacts with the only thing there is: it self!

<p>
	Yes, which is why it's useful to distinguish between relative truth and absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth has no opposite. It is none other than this present experience you are having.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is everything that is, but recontextualized as nondual being.
</p>

<p>
	The only difference between experience and being is that expeirence assumes the context of an ego, a subject who is having the expeirence, whereas with being there is no more subject, subject and object are one. Objects are thus self-illuminating or self-knowing.

</p>

<p>
	You will experience all of them, but even so, that will not even be 0.0000000000000000000001% of EVERYTHING.

<title>Questions about Contemplation</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Depends on what sort of questions you seek answers to.
</p>

<p>
	Start by contemplating simple ordinary things like: Why do people lie? What is anger? What is fear? What is success? Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Those you can get answers to pretty easily just by mulling them over and observing your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	More profound questions like -- What is existence? What am I? What is God? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is death? What is a distinction? -- require transcending the mind into mystical states of consciousness. This can take a lot of focus and work, and it's tricky because the mind itself will get in the way of the answer. The answer to these questions will be experiential, not verbal or logical.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to answer your question by taking a psychedelic. You will see within minutes what the answers to such questions feel like. They are often hyper-intuitive, non-verbal, non-linear, and trans-rational.
</p>

<p>
	I used to think infinity was just a dumb brute force process, but then it was revealed to me that this is not so.
</p>

<p>
	You are so intelligent that you designed every molecule in the universe to work perfectly together and then forgot about it.
</p>

<p>
	Pure intelligence is so infinite it can materialize objects from thin air.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a Jedi who can spawn a star destroyer with his mind. That is the power of God-mind. It's way too radical to believe. It defies all physical laws.
