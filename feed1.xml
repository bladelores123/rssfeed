			What do you think is happening in terms of all these libertarian ideas becoming quite mainstream in political discourse now, as well as things like brexit here in Britain exhibiting nationalistic beliefs? Are we regressing as humans or is it a kind of ego backlash on a population level?

<p>
	I think it is all progress. Progress requires solidification of previous stages to create a stronger foundation. That's what's happening. It's like compacting earth before you start building the house.

<p>
	Bottom line is: it changes your state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Your current state of consciousness is totally inadequate for spiritual understanding.
</p>

<p>
	You need some way to change your state, whether that be psychedelics, concentration, fasting, breathing, whatever.

<p>
	Yes, I pointed this out in my latest blog video.
</p>

<p>
	Except there is a difference. America and Russian are in different developmental positions. And Trump is a moron who is making America weaker. For Russians, Putin is a pretty decent president. For Americans, Trump is a shitty president. We can do much better.

<p>
	I don't want to do nitrous. It doesn't seem healthy.

<p>
	Pure 5-MeO-DMT gives me all the depth I need. It has infinite depth. Just do more trips and you will get more than you can handle. The limit is you, not the 5-MeO-DMT.

	Not for a while. Although it's amazing too. Just not as clear as 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest drawbacks of 5-MeO-DMT is simply that it's too short. I like a solid 3-4 hr trip and you just can't get that with 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>
	It's a limited partial truth.
</p>

<p>
	There are deep problems with the Marxist framing of elites vs working class. This is a dualistic frame and it will not hold up to deep scrutiny and it will cause problems when mistaken for reality.
</p>

<p>
	The boundary between elites and working class is much more fluid. There is really no such thing as "an elite" or "a capitalist" or "a boss". These are gross oversimplifications.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that your "boss" is your enemy is a problematic framing. Your boss is also often your boss because he knows a lot better than you want to do to make the company not die. The boss has a lot more responsibility than the average worker. He has to work night and day to make sure the business doesn't collapse. This requires a lot of intelligence and strategy, and taking on risk.
</p>

<p>
	So simply blaming the bosses is not going to cut it.
</p>

<p>
	But of course bosses can be exploitative too. It's a very complex dynamic.
</p>

<p>
	Russia has evolved enormously and is in its best shape ever.
</p>

<p>
	You take for granted how terribly underdeveloped Russia was 100 years ago, or even 30 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	The living conditions for Russians have improved significantly since the early 1990s under Putin's leadership. Russia is now once again becoming a player on the world stage. You have to see this from Russia's POV, not yours.
</p>

<p>
	Putin is looking out for Russia's survival. Which is exactly what most Russians want. They want more world power and wealth. They don't want to be bullied by Americans.

	Serious business leaders are not con-artists. They're actually good at creating value and results and getting shit done. They run successful companies which build real things. Trump is incapable of that. He's too selfish and ignorant for that. He's only capable of bullshitting his way through life.

<title>Is emotional release necessary on this path?</title>

<p>
	Very necessary if you want to be fully whole and not dysfunctional.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that many of those Buddhist monks are dysfunctional people regardless of how enlightened they are.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening requires a lot of processing of your internal emotional baggage. The more baggage you have, the more you'll have to process to reach ultimate peace.
</p>

<p>
	Working out your emotional baggage is one of the most useful things you can do in life.
</p>

	It is a mistake to suppress emotional and psychological stuff by deciding to just bull your way through to enlightenment. You can bull your way through to enlightenment (maybe), but you will have a lot of inner work to do afterwards. The macho Zen approach is not that effective for most people. Most people need a softer, more emotional, more holistic approach.

</p>

<p>
	And so we end up in the mess we are in.
</p>

<p>
	And the way to get out of this mess is to start to unravel all the selfishness and self-bias and understanding others agendas as if they were your own.

<title>Trump is American Putin</title>

<p>
	Trump is a moron, Putin is a grandmaster strategist.
</p>

<p>
	Also, Putin is not as bad as Trump because Russia is in a very different stage of development. Russia is so corrupt that it requires an authoritarian to keep things steady. Putin is problematic from America's POV but honestly Putin is doing what Russia needs to regain its power on the world stage and defend Russians from exploitation by Americans and their allies.
</p>

<p>
	Putin is a strongman because that's what is required to rule Russia at this point.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful judging Putin when you have no idea how hard it is to rule in Russia. Russia ain't the US or Northern Europe.
</p>

Such an experience might challenge your habits of perception for a while, but that's not the same thing as an increased consciousness. It is possible to have an enlightenment no matter what the circumstance, but drugs only provide an altered mind-state, and certainly not enlightenment. </em>

<p>
	I have my disagreements with Ralston. He's way too dismissive of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics absolutely, 100% increase consciousness.  I don't know how anyone can deny this.

<p>
	JP teaches people to take responsibility for their lives -- "Clean your room. Get your house in order before you go and try to fix the world." -- but then he himself goes and tries to fix the world without having put his (spiritual) house in order.
</p>

<p>
	"Get your house in order" is great advice. But this advice goes much deeper than JP yet realizes. There are many, many degrees of getting one's house in order.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	You may be conscious enough to see that JP shows physical signs of neurosis, but that doesn't mean he is conscious of that. Don't forget, it's very easy to see the self-deceptions of others but much harder to see one's own. So while you can easily see JP's self-deceptions, he can't see them so easily.
</p>

<p>
	Deep down JP believes the things he says are not just true, but so true as to be highly important to communicate to mankind. What he says is relatively true from his POV. From your POV you can see obvious limitations of his worldview. And from my POV I see the obvious limitations of your worldview.
</p>

<title>Jordan Peterson Delusion</title>

<p>
	A) I don't think that JP is being deliberately dishonest or manipulative. He's a true-believer in his ways of seeing the world. He's not dishonest, he's just stuck in self-deception and doesn't see a clear way out. This is a rather sad state of affairs which should spark some compassion in you.
</p>

<p>
	I actually find JP quite honest. It's one of his better qualities. He's honest about his limitations and doubts where most people wouldn't be. Of course being honest does not automatically solve the problem of self-deception. There are many things he's simply not conscious of.
</p>

<p>
	B) Even if he was dishonest and manipulative as you project he is -- even if he was the biggest devil on the planet -- he is still you. So you're still judging and hating yourself. Yes, millions of people can be misled. And your job is accept, forgive, understand, and love that because that is Truth/Reality/God/You.
</p>

<p>
	You can't hate JP for being JP any more than you can hate a kangaroo for being a kangaroo. What else would it be?
</p>

	The blind love to follow the blind.
</p>

<p>
	But don't forget, Jordan Peterson is you. So have compassion for his ignorance and confusion. It is also your ignorance and confusion.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to see JP is as a lost and abused little boy in need of a hug from you. Railing against JP is like shooting fish in a barrel and it only exacerbates the problem.

	Hard work is very important to success. But so is smart work. You gotta work in the right ways, not picking strawberries.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of people work hard but not smart, so they stay poor.

<p>
	Well, considering he invented his scale, it would be silly to say he's not 1000 since he's using himself to calibrate the scale. So it's true by definition.

<p>

	It's not a function of time. Consciousness can be totally omniscient or not, or anything in between. Consciousness can change. It's not simply a monotone thing. You could be sleeping or you could be awake, and much more.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness can take on an infinite number of different states. Like a TV screen.

<p>
	It's pretty weak to just quit so early. Biden still has a decent chance. Trump may simply be in a very bad position economically by November. A lot will happen by November. I'd say the odds right now are 50/50. A lot of people are simply sick of Trump and to them Biden will look like a reasonable, sane, safe way out of Trump's disgrace.
</p>

<p>
	To give up now just because Biden doesn't give you a hard-on is silly.

			Now one is under Ramaji (LOC 1000 author) and he's wife to assist me further into deepening and to find shaktipat. As you said in your last video, going away for deepening and explore healing, this "letting" of consciousness is absolutely true. But I do wonder, if one could ever so possible evolve beyond shaktipat. The idea is there, so I would say so. I don`t want to stop, ever.

<p>
	From my personal experience, there are levels of awakening way beyond 1000. But don't expect Ramaji to admit that. You can't know it until you've been there.

I know you're well evolved, so opening me up for absorption from "your" consciousness, doesn't seem such a bad idea for me :-) So trusting would imply surrendering and opening up for higher change.

<p>
	Consciousness is capable of being infinitely self-aware or not, and an infinite number of degrees in between those two.

<p>
	Wherever you are, you're always at some level. You are closer to zero consciousness than infinity right now.

<p>
	Even that is tricky because people understand love in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	But I generally agree that Love is a very distinctive level of awakening which many lack.
</p>

<p>
	It's also possible they don't talk about it so that you can discover it on your own because love can be a very misleading notion for the ego-mind. Talking about love makes people think love is a personal feeling or something like that.

<p>
	If there are bodies or vehicles, there is no fucking way any military government will give those up for public display in some museum. This would be the most valuable technology on the planet and the first priority would be to use it to gain advantage over other governments. All that will surely be kept top level classified.
</p>

<p>
	It's also reasonable that advanced aliens would not likely crashland on Earth. They probably know how to fly real well.
</p>

<p>
	It makes a lot of sense to me that aliens would fly around and observe us from a distance without meddling in our politics because that is a lost cause.

<p>
	There is a point in becoming more conscious as it improves life.
</p>

<p>
	Also, just because death happens to the body does not automatically mean you stay in Infinite Love forever. You may still not be ready for that and reincarnate as a Nazi or something.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Love is the ulitmate destination, but how long it takes you to get there is up to you. Maybe you'll need 100 lifetimes.

<p>
	What I have seen is this:
</p>

<p>
	When your consciousness goes fully infinite, even the notion of eating cake or experiencing life becomes extraneous. If you were infinitely conscious you would be so complete and full, so not lacking in anything, that life itself would become obsolete and come to an end. You would simply exist as pure Infinite Love forever.
</p>

<p>
	If you are still here eating cake, you're not complete. Your love is indirect.
</p>

<p>
	Just to experience life is already an act of seperation and bias. And with it must come lack, because your highest form is pure formless Love. Until you are an absolute Unity, you are lacking something. When you are an absolute Unity, there is need for celebration or enjoyment of even life. You are too united for such games. They are all indirect. Life itself is indirect.
</p>

<p>
	Life is for kids who are too scared of Infinite Love forever.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is speculating about the levels of consciousnes of people you don't really know.
</p>

<p>
	The correct answer is: you are just guessing. And that's a dangerous game to play as you could easily be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	So be careful. You could really get screwed up that way by assuming too much. You are not in a good position to judge anyone's level of realization until you yourself are deeply realized. And even then it's tricky.

	Since you are God, you are in the very nexus of creation, where Will and Being merge into a seamless Unity. You are in the driver's seat, driving creation.
</p>

<p>
	Reality/God is a tautology, which means it cannot be any other way than the way it is. But it is always in the process of creation, so it will become whatever you create. Your destiny is whatever you end up creating in the now. What is meant to be is whatever you create.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you regret, the ultimate lesson is to forgive yourself and love yourself. There are probably other lessons there as well, but the highest lesson is to accept reality as it is, which in this case includes whatever bad act you committed. You can learn to do it better next time, but the fact is whatever mistakes you made in the past are whatever they are, and could not be otherwise. So accept it. But the future is open and unknown, so you are not doomed to repeat the same mistakes. You get to decide how things will unfold.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to be confused about the lesson. It might take months or years before you learn what the lesson was. The lesson may still be unfolding so maybe you don't have enough data yet to draw a solid conclusion.
</p>

<p>
	UFO sightings are so numerous that it's hard to dismiss it all as delusion or fantasy. There are simply too many credible reports.
</p>

<p>
	It's really not so outrageous that aliens fly around in space. Once you contemplate this idea for a while, you see it's quite reasonable and there are good reasons why they would not just land on the White House lawn like interstellar partycrashers. Mankind is not ready to deal with aliens. We can barely deal with immigrants without going apeshit.

<title>God and Studies in Plato's Metaphysics</title>

<p>
	Reality is Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	No triangles or particles or numbers or shapes are fundamental.
</p>

<p>
	You will never be able to ground reality in any kind of form or object, since they are all imaginary and reality has no bottom, top, beginning, or end.
</p>

<p>
	You will never be able to understand Infinity through any kind of symbolic system like sicence or math. You must access Infinity directly via your consciousness. You are Infinity. So become infinite.
</p>

<p>
	Plato did psychedelics, so he likely had some direct consciousness of God, which informed his philosophy. It's just a question of how deep did he go? How total was his awakening? My guess is, not so total.
</p>

<p>
	His Allegory of the Cave is clearly from doing psychedelics. And its pretty accurate.
</p>

<p>
	I think Plato was on the right track, but he didn't go all the way and his work is rather outdated and murky by today's standards.
</p>

<p>
	You guys are shooting yourselves in the foot.
</p>

<p>
	Politics requires good strategy, not blind idealism.
</p>

<p>
	By calling Obama/Biden war criminals you leave the door wide open for Trump to do something like start WW3.
</p>

<p>
	It's childishly naive and you will lose because people's lives are at stake.
</p>

<p>
	Politics is not about what makes you feel good. Stop making it about you and your feelings. As if appeasing you is the point.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be voting for Mickey Mouse.
</p>

<p>
	The right is united in 2020. If the left goes divided, the right wins, which means progressives lose the most. 4 more years of Trump is not going to help your cause. Biden is a way better alternative, even though you are not passionate about him. Your passions are a luxury. You have to learn how to be pragmatic and strategic at times. Being a rabbid progressive who never compromises is not a virtue. It means you will have almost no power or voice.
</p>

	Since consciousness is infinite, it can be completely self-connected and infinitely telepathic.

	We will be cracking down on all conspiracy theories on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	Those of you who keep posting conspiracy theories here, be careful, because bans are coming.
</p>

<p>
	This is not the place for it. Take your conspiracy theories to Reddit or wherever. Here we do not engage in wild speculation and "us vs them" thinking and blaming.
</p>

<p>
	Since this Covid-19 thing started I have noticed an uptick in fear-mongering and conspiratorial thinking. This is expected, since people are scared and looking for someone to blame rather than taking responsibility for themselves. People also now have a lot more free time on their hands to go down these rabbit holes.

<p>
	But on a deeper level there is still a lack. You lack its taste which is the only reason to put cake in your mouth.
</p>

<p>
	If you could generate the taste of cake using your mind, you'd never need to eat cake. Since you lack that ability, you require cake to give you that taste.
</p>

<p>
	If you could give yourself a proper orgasm, you wouldn't need sex. You use people like pawns precisely because you need them to get what you can't otherwise get.

<p>
	If it was, that won't be good enough to embody that radical degree of consciousness.

<p>
	This is why people become full-time monks. It takes a lot of work to be able to live from that place 24/7.

<p>
	I would treat sex as you would food.
</p>

<p>
	You don't work hard to stop your body from eating. You feel hungry, you eat in reasonable quantity. If you are an obese glutton, then yeah, maybe try a diet.

<p>
	Really?
</p>

<p>
	If you weren't lacking something, why would you have sex?
</p>

<p>
	You relate to others precisely because you lack what they give you.

<p>
	If it happens, good. And if it doesn't happen, good.
</p>

<p>
	But it's easy here to fall into the trap of setting artificial spiritual rules for yourself like, "Thou shalt not fuck ever again." Or holding sexual desires as wrong or evidence of lack of spirituality.

<p>
	The suffering happens when you try to deny or suppress your natural bodily desires.
</p>

<p>
	Just look at how much all these no-fappers suffer. They are at war with themselves.

<p>
	If I want to fuck, I will fuck and enjoy it, and roll it into my spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	And if I stop wanting to ever fuck again, then that will be that.

	From what I have experienced, there are fundamental limitations to being in this body which block you from the highest consciousness.

	You can certainly transcend sex. I just bet you won't. And it's a bit silly to even desire that. I would much rather teach you how to have astounding metaphysical sex.

<title>Can you lose progress in consciousness?</title>

<p>
	Ego backlash is very common. You could consider is losing progress, or you can see it all as part of the whole path.
</p>

<p>
	Like the stock market, you can't always be in a bull market. Life waxes and wanes. There are cycles, phases, and chapters.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to see failure as crucial to your ultimate success. Failure is not a bad thing. It's how we learn our deepest lessons.
</p>

<p>
	There is an old Zen story about how an eager young monk renounced material life and spent years trying to get enlightened. But it just didn't happen for him. Finally he quit in frustration and decided to go immediately to a whorehouse and get laid. As soon as he stuck his dick in, enlightenment happened.

	If you want to stop your sex drive, there's a real simple way. Get your balls removed.

<p>
	Studies are shit and they won't convince you of what consciousness is capable of.
</p>

<p>
	Telepathy is so profound and shocking that your jaw will drop when it hits you over the head like a sledgehammer. You're not gonna understand it through logic or current science.
</p>

<p>
	And that will still just be the tip of the iceberg.
</p>

<p>
	Ditch science. It's shit. Do real spirituality and never look back. Let the scientists circle jerk each other by themselves. They are children. There's no real consciouness to be found in academia.

	Smoke some DMT and you will get a higher dimensional reality.
</p>

<p>
	I have accessed realities beyond our universe. Things which the human mind cannot imagine or even store in memory.
</p>

<p>
	But don't expect to be able to hold that beyond a peak experience.
</p>

<p>
	The human form seems to have fundamental limits, just like how a kangaroo can't do calculus.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is beyond experiencing new realities. Awakening is far more profound and radical than that. It cuts through all realities, all dimensions.

			It's not about being not being humble enough or something. It's not about not being confident either.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's more like saying joking about myself to humiliate myself, not to show myself as a smart person, just to fit in, as I described in a post. I am 100% honest here - my problem is not being too cocky, I already got that covered.

<p>
	I was being cheeky.
</p>

<p>
	That's a low self esteem issue. Which means lack of Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love yourself!
</p>

<p>
	Check out Nathiel Brandon's exercises from Six Pillars of Self-Esteem.
</p>

<p>
	Or just fucking fall in love with yourself. You are beautiful and perfect.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason you are worried about fitting in is because you don't love yourself enough.
