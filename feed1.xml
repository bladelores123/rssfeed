</p>

<p>
	Eventually the awakening "sticks". But there are also various depths of it. Very very few people reach the deepest depths of it. There are depths that even awakened people have not reached.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest depths are totally unimaginable and only attained by tiny handfuls of people.
</p>

	Nothingness is the Source of all sources.

<p>
	How do you know you exist? Which source did you ask?

<title>Does Spirituality reject the physical plane?</title>

<p>
	Spirituality does not reject anything. It is nothing other than looking at whatever is true. If something is false it will get revealed as an illusion in the process.
</p>

<p>
	Physical and spiritual are actually identical. The physical and spiritual world are one and the same.

		</p>

		<p>
			Don't get that confused with the partitioned consciousness, the small self that is your ego.
		</p>

		<p>
			From there you are one perspective and reality is relative.   You are in a "dream" which is consciousness - so everything in the dream is just that.
		</p>

		<p>
			Your mother is still your mother, but you don't have access FROM YOUR perspective to her consciousness, to her memories, otherwise you would no longer be YOU, and you would be HER.
		</p>

		<p>
			So when these things are discussed we should be careful from which perspective we are talking about.  The absolute, or the part!
		</p>

		<p>
			What happened with Akuma is he got a glimpse of his true self - and it's fucking majestic, beautiful, beyond words, and terrifying at the same time.
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			it's like DAMN, whole shit, I AM EVERYTHING.   
		</p>

		<p>
			Then you sync back into your ego and it's like, wtf?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, this is the difference between relative and absolute truths.
</p>

<p>
	The more awoke you get, the more relative truths give way to absolute truths.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's because there is more to mastery than merely the realization of no-self or nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to go deeper with your consciousness work and become conscious of what suffering and pain are. Which is NOT the same thing as enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	You can be enlightened, but you do not have total mastery and you are not conscious of everything your body/mind is doing. You are not yet conscious of how you create suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Initial stages of enlightenment are very far from mastery of the mind/body. There's still tons of stuff you ain't conscious of. Hence in practice an awoke newbie will still suffer.
</p>

<p>
	For you: it's possible to be enlightened and also still suffer and be depressed, since enlightenment neither guarantees nor precludes a state of any kind.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is none other than Truth. And Truth includes all states, all feelings, all emotions.
</p>

<p>
	Even enlightened masters can get triggered! They are not superhuman robots.
</p>

<p>
	With a deep enough enlightenment there should be no depression.
</p>

<p>
	Depression is mostly the result of improper psychology, not some permanently bad brain chemistry. The bad brain chemistry is mostly caused by improper psychology, diet, and lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
	A practice like Kriya yoga will also rewire your brain and can create ecstatic bliss.

<p>
	Except nihilism is true. Life has no meaning. So by demonizing nihilism you drive people to believe in egoic fairy tales.
</p>

<p>
	There is no enlightenment without facing nihilism. Hence the Dark Night Of The Soul.
</p>

<p>
	The saddest part of all this is that by rejecting nihilism JP is preventing himself from realizing God.

	In practice most people will need to take several stepping stones before getting to their ultimate life purpose. I spent about 3 years building a business I hated in order to become financially independent enough to start my dream business.
</p>

<p>
	That's what being a strategic motherfucker means. Most people never think that far ahead, and so their life reflects that.
</p>

<p>
	Most people will not be able to start their dream career right off the bat because there are real-world financial and other limitations. Meaning you gotta plan and work towards it. Build skills, save money, develop social connections, etc.

<p>
	Lol, clearly the dude who wrote that has not smoked enough 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	The highest tax rate has been slashed from 90% to 45%. Corporate tax rates are absurdly low and full of loopholes. Income inequlity has skyrocketed. Average worker wages have stagnated for 30 years. CEO pay has skyrocketed. Money in politics has skyrocketed. Corporate power and lobbying has skyrocketed. Unions have been almost eliminated. Stock buy-backs are legal again. Many industries have been deregulated. Social security and medicare are under attack and would be eliminated if conservatives got their way. Healthcare costs are out of control. The drug war is out of control. Environmental regulations are being dismantled. Public education is being dismantled. Military spending is out of control. Disaster capitalism is rampant. The Republican party has lost all sense of decency, integrity, and truthfulness. Right wing propaganda channels like Fox News and Brietbart are disinforming the populace.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that the world faces newer, more complex problems than in the 1960's, which demands much greener solutions.
</p>

<p>
	See Noam Chomsky's analysis of the situation.
</p>

<p>
	If income inequality continues at this rate the entire US economy could collapse. Yet here we are talking about a few radical feminist college students who grind JP's gears.

	Remember, the journey is the best part, not the destination.
</p>

<p>
	I have some fond memories of fighting to escape wage slavery. It was tough but also fun.
</p>

<p>
	And remember, freedom isn't all good. Too much freedom comes with its own problems.

<p>

<p>
	I have no doubt that 5-MeO-DMT could supercharge a psychic person's abilities by 100x.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO basically makes me omniscient.

A diamond in the rough which you must now polish. Follow those breadcrumbs and something juicy should materialize in the end. Leave some room for improvisation and innovation in your plan. So you're not being a copycat but doing something new.

</p>

<p>
	Of course hardcore spiritual practice will increase odds of developing psychic abilities by 100 fold. But still doesn't mean you will get them.
</p>

<p>
	Om Swami is a hardcore monk beast. Results not typical (as they say).
</p>

<p>
	Intense Kriya Yoga is the best way I know to unlock psychic abilities. Years of it.

<p>
	This is all a problem of low self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
	Do 1 year of Nathaniel Branden's self-esteem exercises from his books. That's the solution.
</p>

<p>
	Also more self-love. Watch some of Matt Kahn's self-love videos. She's all about helping women with low self-esteem. You gotta learn to love yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can help you realize how beautiful you are. You are literally a Goddess after all! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> I never love myself more than when I'm on a psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	What your ego is trying to get from you bf is pseudo-love. And it will never work. Never! You will always be left feeling incomplete. You must have a spiritual awakening to the fact that YOU ARE LOVE! Give yourself the love you want him to give you. It's very counter-intuitive.
</p>

<p>
	It's impossible to not be beautiful when you realize you are the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	And by completing all the above your bf will respect and love you more. But it won't even matter at that point because you will already have loved yourself.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is the solution.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics could help you see the good and love again. She's not really gone. She and you are one forever. Maybe try some MDMA, 5-MeO-DMT, or mushrooms so you can realize this directly. They will reconnect you with divine love and oneness and help you deal with any emotional baggage that remains.
</p>

<p>
	Also remember that a grieving process is totally normal. Especially this early into it. Don't avoid the grieving, rather go more fully into it. Explore it. Rather than trying to be all "spiritual" and stoic, dive into the feeling! Feel deeper!
</p>

<p>
	And be gentle with yourself. Don't forget to love yourself.
</p>

Why not just start the relationship and see how it goes? It's not marriage. It's just a relationship. It might work, it might not.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of women is to get into relationships with them! The sex gets 100x better. The relationship is fun and rewarding.
</p>

<p>
	You were born ready. Just do it. It will be a growing experience. Do not wait for "the perfect one". Ain't no such thing. Learn to love who she is, as she is -- not as some fantasy you imagined.
</p>

<title>Fantasy of men taking advantage</title>

How did you get love/approval from him, or lack there of? That might hold a clue.
</p>

<p>
	But also rape fantasies for women are totally natural and I would say even healthy so long as you're doing it playfully with your man.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between being turned on by that kind of behavior vs actually allowing yourself to be abused by someone you're intimate with. People get turned on by all sorts of weird stuff and it's not necessarily a problem as long as you understand that it's a fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Low self-esteem is also a huge issue for women who get abused by men. Probably the #1 cause. A man will only respect you as much as you respect yourself. You can raise self-esteem through Nathaniel Branden's work.
</p>

<p>
	Don't stop, just switch up your visualization/affirmation to something else. Awareness is best handled by meditation. But there are many other things you could visualize which meditation cannot give you.

</p>

<p>
	But Green is capable of killing people, just like any stage is. Especially when things get political. Political leaders have to make many tough choices which usually involve the death of people.
</p>

<p>
	Take a look at what happened in Osho's ashram. They almost killed people even though their culture was very Green.

There are no guarantees but hardcore yogic practices are probably the best way. Most people will not get them.

<title>Is Enlightenment the end of all Anxiety/Depression?</title>

<p>
	Yes, enlightenment should put an end to that.
</p>

<p>
	But practically speaking you probably won't attain enlightenment without first conquering your OCD. It's a two-way street.
</p>

<p>
	You must become conscious of what your fear and sadness is, along with what you are. It's all interconnected at rock bottom. Fear and depression and ego is all one thing. One giant self-sustaining illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are great for this.
</p>

<p>
	Our society has been going right for 50+ years.
</p>

<p>
	There is no serious discussion with JP because he does not understand feminism, post-modernism, relativism, socialism, morality, developmental psychology, or spirituality. He is not helping his audience understand these complex and nuanced topics.
</p>

<p>
	I'm willing to bet good money that no JP fan has ever read a single feminist or post-modernist book. So this isn't a discussion so much as it's bigotry.
</p>

<p>
	JP himself is pretty well-read. But his audience is not. So it turns in turns into a one-eyed man leading the blind off a cliff.
</p>

<p>
	But don't take my word for it. Discover for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Penrose is great stage Yellowish scientist. But he lacks direct nondual experience. He's about where Albert Einstein and the fathers of quantum mechanics were. But that's still not high enough to really understand what consciousness is. So close yet so far.

He just creates a straw man out of Green. JP has a Green shadow. He is denying Green, judging it, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I have posted examples of this on my blog in the past. Like this doozy of ignorance:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LquIQisaZFU?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	But you see, he doesn't need to be hateful. All he needs to do is create this judgmental ideology, this straw man, and poison the well, and the alt-right will do the rest for him. He's a gateway into the alt-right. He himself will never say anything hateful, but his philosophy will give aid and comfort to xenophobia, Islamophobia, racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, socialism-phobia, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's basically like Fox News. They are never directly hateful per se, but they create toxic propaganda which keeps many people in ignorance and ultimately bolsters judgment and hatred.
</p>

<p>
	The dangerous person teaching your kids is JP. Lol.
</p>

<p>
	A refugee crisis created by a stage Orange overactive American capitalist military-industrial complex. The one JP is defending. It was obvious that the Neo-Con's wars would cause all sorts of systemic blowback. If the USA had a stage Green government there would be a lot less refugees and terrorism. The irony is that conservatives are creating the very thing they hate: hordes of angry brown Muslims. Just wait until the effects of global warming kick in. The refugee problem will become 10x worse thanks to Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Integrating refugees is a valid issue. A nation cannot integrate an unlimited number of refugees. But this must be carefully distinguished from ethnocentric objections to taking in refugees. For example the USA can support millions more refugees. Conservatives who oppose immigration here are not doing it on systemic-collapse grounds but on ethnocentric grounds. They don't like brown foreigners diluting "their" country.

<p>
	You have not watched enough of his political commentary.
</p>

<p>
	In his university lectures he does not demonize as much as in his political commentary. And it's his political commentary which made him famous.
</p>

<p>
	JP's entire public career is predicated on attacking Green. He makes millions of dollars directly off that. His most loyal fans love him because of that.
</p>

<p>
	I hesitate to even post a video rebutting JP because I know his fans will try to attack me, hack my accounts, DDoS attacks, doxxing, swatting, death threats, etc. Because that's how an angry stage Blue/Orange ego behaves.
</p>

<p>
	He has created in anti-feminist, anti-socialist, anti-post-modernist ideological cult.

<p>
	Soviet Union was Red/Blue not Green.
</p>

<p>
	His conflation of Soviet Union with America and socialism is abysmally wrong-headed.
</p>

<p>
	The most advanced, developed, happiest, and healthiest countries in the world are: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Netherlands, etc. They are stage Green, verging on Yellow. Yes, they pay more taxes so that society is more even and fair for average people. The metric of success is not tax rate but average happiness, education, health, and success levels.
</p>

<p>
	His wisdom is not so practical when it polarizes young white males into demonizing stage Green, collectivism, post-modernism, environmentalism, and women's/minority rights. His audience has not integrated these things at all. Nor has JP.
</p>

<p>
	Meanwhile American society is drowning in pathological Orange to the point of global collapse.
</p>

<p>
	That's like worrying about jellyfish when there's a great white shark headed right at you.

You could teach yourself to stop creating it. Then you would enter nirvana. But you'd also be dead.
</p>

<p>
	Nirvana is the realization that negativity does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	Heaven is always here, but the ego turns it into hell.

<p>
	There are many different universities and programs. You can certainly find universities which teach positive and transpersonal psychology.
</p>

<p>
	Life coaching or hypnotherapy is another option.
</p>

<p>
	Hell, you could become a psychic and get clients through Yelp (assuming you had psychic abilities). I know a psychic couple who charge $200/hr for healing.
</p>

<p>
	The more woo-woo you get, the more you'll have to run your own shop, which means learning biz and marketing skillz. But that can be super rewarding.

<p>
	The whole point of being a tenured professor is that you can basically research whatever the hell you want. You can even get government grants for your research and hire research assistants.

<p>
	Mars colonies don't materialize from thin air. It takes 4 billion years of murder to create a Mars colony. And on that Mars colony you will have people who will use force to survive. Not to mention your killing of plants (which of course you conveniently don't even consider as initiation of force). But you are literally enslaving plants and eating them. Did you ask the plant for permission to eat it? Is the plant being eaten voluntarily?
</p>

<p>
	Do you see how ridiculously self-biased your whole worldview is? You are so selfish you don't even see your actions as selfishness!

<p>
	Without initiation of force against others life could not exist.

<p>
	Survival is force, manipulation, theft, killing, and deception.

<p>
	You are lying to yourself that you do not initiate force. See how you pretend to be an angel while actually being a devil?
</p>

<p>
	As soon as your survival is threatened, you will initiate force and then you will justify it to yourself as not an initiation of force. Because in your egoic delusion you are an angel and must maintain that heroic self-image. By definition, anything you say, do, or think is "good" in your own mind because all you know and care about is your survival. All of your high ideals are just part of your survival strategy. They are survival through deception.

<p>
	No! You fundamentally misunderstand how ego works.
</p>

<p>
	Ego defines everything relative to itself. "Self-defense" and "good" just mean: whatever is good FOR ME -- whatever I believe.
</p>

<p>
	People do not agree on anything. That's the whole problem.
</p>

<p>
	People are dishonest and lying ALL THE TIME! Most people are full of shit, even with themselves. All of those libertarians are full of shit. Therein lies the problem. They don't realize their own bullshit. All of their high ideals are just fantasies of the ego which is acting noble when in fact it is a selfish devil. A libertarian has no idea of how the ego is running the entire show.
</p>

<p>
	A libertarian is just a devil in sheep's clothing. What's worse, he's so deluded he's managed to convince himself he's an angel. At least a warlord is honest with himself that he's a devil.

	Lol, to the ego, there is no difference between defense and offense. Your anarcho-communist commune will attack a neighboring commune and slit all their throats in the name of "self defense". Of course they will rationalize it to themselves as being fully consistent with their lofty non-aggression principle, in exactly the same way that the US rationalized the invasion of Iraq as "liberation" and self-defense against evil-doers.
</p>

<p>
	What you are describing is exactly what governments do now. Only you're describing a version of it from 10,000 years ago. It's like you want to roll social evolution back by 10,000 years, thinking it will hold. But you can't wish nuclear weapons away.

There are left and ring wing versions of libertarianism.
</p>

<p>
	There are even anarcho-communists:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-communism</a>
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that doesn't work at scales of tens of millions of people. Yes, a handful of farmers can get together and build a local farm road. But they can't build an interstate highway or stop giant corporations from pouring toxic waste into a lake or running nationwide high speed 5G wireless phone networks.
</p>

<p>
	Modern governments with 100+ million people require massive infrastructure to maintain. You can't get that by living in tent villages and bartering homegrown lettuce with your hippie neighbors.
</p>

<p>
	Warlords will certainly enslave your hippie commune if there is no strong federal government to protect it. But even more realistically your hippie commune you will self-collapse from greed and sexual and other scandals. A sociopathic narcissist will hijack your commune and turn it into a criminal cult.

What are you trying to know or understanding?
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What am I?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why is there something rather than nothing?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is consciousness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is love?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is another?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is the mind?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is ego?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do I end suffering?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You want to be clear about what insight you want.
</p>

<p>
	What the fuck do you want??
</p>

<p>
	If you want nothing then be clear about that and just sit in peace without effort (the do nothing technique).
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot too.
</p>

<p>
	No, meditation is going to surface emotional "stuff". It only becomes calm after years and years of heavy practice.
</p>

<p>
	For a Zen monk with 20 years of daily practice, yes, it's now calm. But that ain't you.
</p>

<p>
	Although sitting still should still be doable for you. Not sure why your legs need to be flailing around.

</p>

<p>
	Nothing wrong with getting a Green job. Yellow is built on top of Orange & Green. You can't just start a Yellow biz in mid-air. You'd probably first need to gain experience running a business at Orange. That is hard as it is. A Yellow biz is not easy to achieve. Every higher stage gets harder and harder. It's not an accident that Yellow and Turquoise businesses are very rare. It takes exceptional skill to create and sustain them.
</p>

<p>
	I couldn't start Actualized.org until I first gained proficiency in Orange enough to pay my bills and attract viewers. Without Orange Actualized.org would not exist.

<p>
	That's really my only criticism of the Majority Report. As Green, they are too adversarial against Orange & Blue, thus deepening the polarization.
</p>

<p>
	But that's just how Green is. It ain't yet Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	I thought about sharing Spiral Dynamics with them, but they would probably demonize me for it. Green does not want to give up its hatred of Orange.

Maybe you should build the thing you seek rather than expecting it to fall in your lap.
</p>

<p>
	Create a stage Yellow company. Found a stage Yellow academic community. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you don't necessarily need a entire Yellow community to start. Start by finding 1 solid Yellow colleague/friend. And build up from there. This is not like having Facebook friends. Less is more.
</p>

<p>
	Seminars, workshops, and conferences would be a great place to find Yellow people. Find a few Yellow workshops and go there every year just to network and make friends. Go to workshops that stage Yellow people would attend. Like systems thinking or ecology or those that tackle worldwide systemic problems.
</p>

<p>
	A psychedelics conference would a good place. I've posted psychedelic workshops on my blog before.
</p>

<p>
	Hell, Don Beck even holds a Spiral Dynamics conference every year!

<p>
	That's because the higher your development the easier it is to awaken because the higher your perspective-taking ability is and the more openminded you are.
</p>

<p>
	But be careful with your generalizations. All of these people are different and they lived long lives which involved lots of unseen development work. You probably cannot imagine how much work such people did on themselves. We're talking 10s of thousands of hours of work and study.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse humility and simplicity of teaching with lack of work. Just the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	Most of the people on the Turquoise list are world-class masters.

<p>
	If you want to get a fair sense of Green politics I suggest you check out the YouTube channel, Majority Report. They are the epitome of Green, but notice that they are not some kooky student activist with utopian ideas. Their political analysis is sharp, nuanced, pragmatic, and intelligent -- despite their biases. They are smart socialists and if you listen to them long enough you might become a socialist yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, they are not Yellow. So don't expect them to be as wise as Yellow or the stuff I share on Actualized. Nor am I suggesting you should become a socialist.
</p>

<p>
	Just make sure you are getting a fair assessment of each stage. Look for the best examples of each stage, not the worst. You can find monstrous and kooky people at each stage if you look hard enough. For example, I could smear all of stage Orange as being like Trump. But that would be very unfair to Orange. He is like the worst of the worst of Orange.
</p>

<p>
	For another great example of Green see Bernie Sanders. He's not some kook. He's got a very sensible agenda and his value system is very advanced. Good luck finding a politician with a more advanced value system and higher integrity.
</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			The reason is that I have my life purpose in mind, but it will take around 5-10 years of study and skill building to achieve. In the meantime, I would like to have the time and freedom to actually gain skill in my life purpose. That’s why I’m interested in the programming business.
		</p>

		<p>
			I’m currently in college, but I hate my degree and would like to start a business ASAP. Any tips? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, how to start a business is a HUGE topic & skill set all on its own. There are thousands of books, courses, videos, seminars, workshops, and trainings available on this topic.
</p>

<p>
	It would be relatively easy to set up a web programming business where you get clients to pay you so that your small team of programmers can code their website or app. There is a near endless demand for high quality web programming teams. If you were smart you could manage such a team remotely. You could have a 100% virtual programming business by hiring good programmers from overseas like in Eastern Europe or India.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all of this requires business & project management skills. But that's not too hard to learn if you are serious. You could easily make 6 figures like this.
</p>

<p>
	And that's just one idea.
</p>

			So you would define post-modernist, transgender identity-politics people that are also Marxist as green and thereby higher in development as Jordan Peterson?

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes. The intention of such Green people is fairness for oppressed minorities. Which is a fairly evolved set of values. It is much more evolved than those who cry "white genocide" or complain about the war on Christmas or white males.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that people like JP and the alt-right media have created a demonized stereotype out of these post-modernist Marxist types. They do not really exist. JP and his ilk have taken like 1% of the most extreme Green folks and smeared all of Green with that. They've created a straw man out of Green and of course the straw man is easy to knock down. But Green is not that straw man. There are many very serious, sane, sober, lovely Green people. And they are higher than JP and his ilk. Radical feminist activists in universities DO NOT represent the majority of stage Green.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I smeared all of stage Orange as greedy capitalist pigs who exploit children in sweatshops and kill polar bears for fun. I could create a whole YT channel about that and get millions of followers to agree with my selective outrage. I could create 100's of videos of children in sweatshops, big oil spills, and corporate corruption. That's analogous to what JP and the alt-right media is doing to Green. The reality is much more nuanced.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest tragedy is that JP and his ilk are missing several key lessons from post-modernism. Regardless of any excesses or faults, post-modernism made crucial intellectual discoveries which are being denied by JP. Like the relativity of all cultures, all value systems, and the socially constructed nature of all categories and paradigms. This is very important to understand into order to create a peaceful and well-functioning world. You are not a serious intellectual if you think that the white race's value system or the capitalist value system is objectively superior to others. The acknowledgment of relativity is vital to the development of higher levels of morality.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Orange sorely lacks the understanding of relativity. It also fails to appreciate the importance of collectivism -- since we do live in a community. We are not individuals who get to do whatever we please.
</p>

<p>
	Is it an accident that JP is a climate change denier? He's even in denial that he's in denial! This is not going to cut it in the future. We need a lot more ecological awareness if we want to thrive.
</p>

It will tell itself it knows more than it does. You can count on this.
</p>

<p>
	But if your intent for truth is genuine and you are forcing yourself to self-reflect and question all of your beliefs, that should ultimately lead you closer and closer to the truth. You have to be brutally honest with yourself or else you will settle for wishful and self-biased delusions.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot too. On psychedelics you clearly see what genuine insight feels like. It is undeniable and transcends all belief, ideology, or speculation.
</p>

<p>
	It also helps to have great teachers and great books to keep your egotistical fantasies in check.

So all you got to do is build up more of those skills and build an awesome portfolio which showcases your skills.
</p>

<p>
	While you are job-hunting, spend the rest of your time building your audio engineering skills & portfolio. If you end up working at Walmart, keep building your audio engineering skills on the evenings and weekends. After a few years of that you'll get your desired job.
</p>

<p>
	If you can afford to take 6 to 12 months off to focus solely on building your skills, that would be ideal. In 12 months of full-time skill-building you should be a very solid entry-level audio engineer candidate.
</p>

<p>
	That's how I got my first job as a video game designer.
</p>

<p>
	When you are applying for jobs, you should be applying all around the country, not just in your city.

</p>

<p>
	But it requires that you offer value to the employer rather than being a leech.
</p>

<p>
	What job do you want? What skills do you have? Are you showcasing your skills well with a portfolio?
</p>

<p>
	These days training yourself and building skills is easier than ever. You must train yourself and then show evidence to your employer of your skills and your willingness to learn further on the job.
</p>

<p>
	Building a great portfolio is a MUST as far as I'm concerned. With a great portfolio you will eliminate all your competition.
</p>

<p>
	People being more experienced than you is not a significant factor because those people also demand a higher salary. Employers are always looking for people with low experience because they need people to do grunt work and those who will work for lower salaries.
</p>

<p>
	You are not competing with people with 5-10 years of experience. You are competing with people who have 1-2 years of experience, which you can provide for yourself. "Experience" does not have to mean that you were a salaried employee during that time. Experience could mean: you working on a project in your mother's basement.

</p>

<p>
	Generally, you cannot change a thing which doesn't want to change. So you could work with your girlfriend so long as she was open to growing and learning about Spiral Dynamics. Changing an Orange workplace is probably a no-go. You'd be better off finding a Green workplace or starting your own.

	The research is not called "spiral dynamics" per se. What we're talking about here is the entire field of Development Psychology which includes hundreds of researchers.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber does a good job of integrating and mentioning many of the researchers.
</p>

<p>
	Here are but a few names:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Jane Lovinger
	</li>
	<li>
		Piaget
	</li>
	<li>
		Kurt Fischer
	</li>
	<li>
		Robert Kegan
	</li>
	<li>
		Susanne Cook-Greuter
	</li>
	<li>
		Kohlberg
	</li>
	<li>
		Gilligan
	</li>
	<li>
		Jean Gebser
	</li>
	<li>
		Maslow
	</li>
	<li>
		Clare Graves, Don Beck
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	It takes work on your part to integrate all this stuff and see the bigger picture. Do not expect the current state of science or academia to give you the big picture. It gives you tiny fragments which you must piece together.
</p>

You were given a list of ways to move beyond each color in each video.
</p>

<p>
	Now you must actually do it.

<p>
	It sorta is. A spiral is an upwards moving circle.
</p>

<p>
	Overall reality seems to move towards greater and greater complexity. Society is becoming more and more complex. There can certainly be collapse, but the idea that humans were more evolved 10,000 years ago than today strikes me as wrong.
</p>

<p>
	I do not see how the chaos and egotism of modern society can be avoided through collapse of society. We are more likely to pass through it by growing society, not by abolishing society.
</p>

<p>
	I like Shunya overall, but the apocalyptic aspect of his teachings I do not agree with. I once asked him about ancient Rome and he told me how great it was back then without acknowledging that 40% of the population were slaves. Not so great methinks. I will take post-modernity any day.

			Anarchy is simply without government, or rulers. It doesn't remove anything else. David Friedman has explained thoughtfully how for instance law enforcement and the justice system would work in such a society. If your daughter was raped and mother enslaved, you would be paying an Agency, which you've chosen based on your preference of laws, even before, as insurance, to track down the assailants, and then deal with the assailant's agency along with a private court to make a deal.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Ahahahahaha!
</p>

<p>
	That Agency and private court would already be owned by the dictator and his cronies. When you come to them to report the crime, they will spit in your face, take your wallet, and laugh you out of the building.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarians have no idea how human nature really works.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "without government or rulers". Without rulers, the strongest most ruthless narcissist becomes the ruler, enslaving everyone to his whims.
</p>

<p>
	What you are describing is worse than modern day Iraq or Afghanistan.

<p>
	I have not done SDS for a long time. I mostly use other techniques. But don't let that stop you from using it. It's a solid technique. Although I think Kriya yoga is superior.

<p>
	There are various versions of anarchism as an ideology. There are flavors of it in Orange and flavors of it in even in Green.
</p>

<p>
	You have to distinguish anarchy as a political ideology vs actual anarchy, which nobody actually wants.
</p>

<p>
	Most ideological anarchy is just mental-masturbation mixed with naivety and inexperience with how the world works.
</p>

<p>
	When your daughter is being raped and your mother enslaved, your high ideals of anarchy will fly out the window. The ego is actually terrified of actual anarchy as that means lack of control, disorder, and death.
</p>

<p>
	In an anarchic system all that would happen is that the strongest, most ruthless, more power-hungry would enslave you and you family. Order would be installed to serve the dictator. Only you would end up at the bottom of the hierarchy as one of the slaves. Unless maybe you were willing to claw your way to the middle by stabbing people in the back. This is stage Red.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	That is generally what enlightenment requires:
</p>

<p>
	1) Solid ability to concentrate one's mind
</p>

<p>
	2) Turning one's observational awareness in on itself, towards The Self
</p>

<p>
	Both components are super-important. They tend not to be effective one without the other.

Shinzen Young only became a Zen monk due to his massive use of drugs and psychedelics in the 60's. I have specifically talked to him about that and he is very openminded to 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	You won't understand my position on psychedelics unless you take the leap and try them.

<p>
	It's like you're saying that 1st grade is closer to 3rd grade because both are odd, while 2nd grade is even. So what? 2nd grade is still closer to 3rd grade.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense Green is further away from Turquoise because in its own mind it already thinks it is Turquoise. The similarity actually makes it more self-deceptive and therefore harder to ascend. At least Yellow understands that there is a Turquoise above it. Green often doesn't. There is a big difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2. In this sense Yellow is much closer to Turquoise because they're both Tier 2.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest thing Green lacks is the meta-perspective of Tier 2.
</p>

<p>
	You know... psychedelics clear up this issue very quickly. Hence their value in this work. Otherwise the mind keeps wasting years asking conceptual questions which would otherwise be answered and laid to rest in a few minutes on psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Why ask me questions when you can go straight to the source? Let God shows you the answers. It's far cooler and more fun than asking me.
