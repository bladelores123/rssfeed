</p>

<p>
	Non-existence isn't real, it is imaginary!
</p>

<p>
	There is only existence. Existence is an Absolute and has no opposite.
</p>

<p>
	A non-existent object is actually an existent object in your imagination. But you are misunderstanding that object's true nature. You take it as really non-existent when it is actually existent as a thought. Your mind confuses thoughts and objects. For example, you confuse thoughts of your mother for your mother.
</p>

<p>
	The kicker is, if you didn't create this confusion you couldn't have a mother. Since a mother is a thought, not an object.
</p>

<p>
	So how are you gonna escape this confusion? Escaping it would mean the collapse of your entire reality. Can you stomach that?
</p>

<title>Yang vs. Sanders</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	We have had decades of inaction.
</p>

<p>
	Sanders is just the kick in the ass we need. Of course he won't be able to pass everything he wants. But he will lead a movement that will shift the overtone window seriously left, which is what we have been lacking for 50 years.
</p>

<p>
	Sanders could be the next FDR. If only he was younger.
</p>

<p>
	Working class people, even Republicans will like Bernie as he pushes against elites.
</p>

<p>
	The ones who hate Bernie are mostly elites.
</p>

<p>
	A working class person is not going to hate Bernie.
</p>

<p>
	FDR was the most popular president of all time. But the elites hated him. I predict a similar sitation if Bernie wins.
</p>

<p>
	Of course hardcore conservatives will demonize him. But they demonized Obama, so there is no pleasing them.
</p>

<p>
	Fox News will demonize no matter who the Democratic president is.
</p>

<p>
	Data seems to show that conservatives benefit from voter suppression, not expansion.
</p>

<p>
	Australia has mandatory voting. Seems to work for them.

<p>
	It's very simple: is your birth happening right now? No? Then you are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	If you object, "Yeah, but at one time it really was happening", just notice that you are imagining that too.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot ever escape imagination. If a thing is not being imagined right now, it doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple. You just don't want to accept it because you want things to be "real".
</p>

<p>
	Everything is imaginary, including brains, atoms, planets, science, logic, and your life.
</p>

<p>
	Brains seem to exist from your POV because that is what you're stucking imagining without being aware that you are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness imagines a brain. Your entire paradigm is backwards.

<p>
	You don't need to zoom into it. It is already nothing as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Form is nothing. Don't go hunting for nothing. Nothing is everywhere. You are like a fish hunting for water.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, space is not nothing, it is something. But since something is ultimately nothing, space is also nothing.

<p>
	Of course you can't upgrade the level of development of an entire country by several stages in 15 years.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless you guys are making progress. You got to work out those tribal differences and learn the value of pluralistic democracy which tolerates minority rights. Learning that less will take you guys 50-100 years, but you gotta start wherever you're at. It's not like the Saddam situation was sustainable. Eventually he would have died of natural causes, his sons would have been even worse than him, and there would be a bloody revolution to overthrown them. So the US invasion only hastened the inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	Forcing people to vote is still better than no voting at all.
</p>

<p>
	Even in America 50% of people don't vote.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not so bad. Things will get better.
</p>

We have many words for everything, and each one has slight nuances. Nuance is important.
</p>

<p>
	To call Actualized.org religion would be inappropriate. To call it spirituality is more appropriate, although limited.

<title>Online Dating</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Online dating requires above average looks, REALLY good professional profile photos (no selfies), and massive volume.
</p>

<p>
	Online dating requires serious work. You don't just put up a profile and start getting dates. You gotta game it more than real life.
</p>

<p>
	Online girls are screening you almost entirely on looks because they have nothing else to go by. Your personality has no chance to charm them. In real life you can hit much higher outside your league with charm and boldness. This cannot be done online. The girl has to decide whether she will sleep with you purely based on your profile photo in 1 second.
</p>

<p>
	If you're turning online because you're too lazy to do it in real life, chances are your results will be bad. Laziness is not a viable strategy for finding attractive females.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a classically handsome appearance, you can do well online. If not...
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, there's much more to reforming government than a single proposal like UBI.
</p>

<p>
	UBI vs jobs guarantee is like 7th on the list of important issues.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful about turning into a single-issue voter. A politician must considered holistically, not on the basis of one cool proposal.

<p>
	Religion is just spirituality turned into unquestioned ideology.
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean spirituality is free of dogma or ideology. Just that religion is much, much worse.
</p>

<p>
	Religion is what you call it when spirituality has turned into a cancer of the mind.

<title>Why does everything seem to be so consistent, if all there is is perception?</title>

<p>
	What you're noticing with your line of questioning is the collapse of the selfish/selfless duality.
</p>

<p>
	You should expect all such dualities to breakdown at the edges when you question them deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	God is the Absolute Unity for all dualities.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot say that God is X because God is also not X, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity is unqualifiable. Anything you say about it is always finite, partial, limited, and in a sense, misleading. Absolute Infinity cannot be fully explicated in finite form. Infinity is by its very nature implicit. It cannot be fully unfolded (because it goes on forever).

	There is software you can install which will block your access to certain websites you select, like YouTube or whatever. You can even set a schedule in this software so that you can access YouTube after work, or on the weekends but not during weekdays.
</p>

<p>
	This kind of thing can help give your life some structure if you are unable to discipline yourself.

<title>Is Bernie Sanders a populist?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/40835-is-bernie-sanders-a-populist/?do=findComment&amp;comment=511215</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Yes, but the difference is that Sanders is genuinely concerned about little people. Trump is not. Trump is obsessed with materialism and wealth and fame. So he's just an oligarch in populist clothing.
</p>

<p>
	It's not enough to speak populism. You have to walk your talk. You can't be a serious populist if live in a $100 million dollar house and play golf every weekend with millionaires.
</p>

<p>
	A real populist would care about the lowest classes of society. Trump is the opposite of that. He only uses populist language when it suits his rise to the top.
</p>

<p>
	This is a classic tactic. It's called demagogery. Nazis, fascists, and Communists were masters at this.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Funny enough, Bill Gates lives in a $100 million house, yet he still cares about helping poor people. So it's complicated. It is possible to be rich and still care a lot about little people. But it tends to be rare. And Trump certainly isn't that way. What really matters is not your wealth but your level of consciousness and compassion for others. It's no accident that wealthy people often lack compassion because they needed to be ruthless to earn their wealth in the first place. It's very hard to earn a billion dollars without being ruthlessly exploitative.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, any firewall we build will be abusable by future devils. Nevertheless, in practice, a better gov and court system helps to keep the biggest devils at bay.
</p>

<p>
	As an example, slavery is no longer possible in most of the world due to suffciently evolved legal systems. This was not the case 500 years ago. Of course our legal system can still be exploited, but not nearly as badly as it used to be. So there is improvement.

<p>
	You have to ground yourself in the desire for Truth as opposed to meaning.
</p>

<p>
	If Truth is what you most desire, and the Truth turns out to meaningless, you will be satisfied with it because what you really wanted was the Truth, regardless of what it is.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want meaning more than Truth, then you're in trouble because of the Truth happens to be that all meaning is imaginary, you will have to deny it or act upset.
</p>

<p>
	To desire Truth is to want it regardless of what it is. Truth for truth's sake.

<p>
	Maps come in various degrees of accuracy, with some being totally wrong. But even if you have a very accurate map it is important be conscious that the map is never the territory it depicts.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it's important to understand that "the Earth" is an imagination you are now having.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that there is no Earth in your current direct experience. Which obviously means you must be imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	The floor you're standing or sitting on is not "the Earth".

This individual is my father who is at rock bottom. He doesn't take responsibility for the idea of the trip but has expressed to me that he is willing to take my advice and help seriously. He says that he can't take another month of what his mind is currently doing. He watched something on the news last night about how some people are using Psilocybin to cure depression and anxiety, so something external besides myself is providing him with information within his paradigm. He refuses to help himself, but is continuing to question this. He has asked other people close to us about the experience. He asks them "so what do I do? Do I just sit there? Do I walk around?" <br />
			<br />
			Does this possibly re-contextualize the question for you? If it doesn't, do you know any other approaches I could take that would see quick short term improvements?

<p>
	Yes, that is better.
</p>

<p>
	In which case 1g of mushrooms or 75ug of LSD is a great starting point.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure he's not on SSRI medication.
</p>

<p>
	And explain to him some of the basic theory of how the mind constructs all of reality. He needs to understand that psychedelics are not a hallucination any more than a brick wall is. As he's tripping tell him to contemplate how his mind is constructing reality.

	I've considered it, but I'm not really interested in interviewing others. I'm mostly interested in sharing deep insights directly with my viewers.
</p>

<p>
	Interviewing people requires a different intent and skillset. I have too much to say.
</p>

<p>
	I'm also not really interested in waiting for someone else to ask me deep questions. I would rather cut to the point.

</p>

<p>
	Do not give psychedelics to random people who are not taking responsibility for the trip.
</p>

<p>
	The person doing the trip should proactively do research and have an intrinsic motivation to trip. They should not be apathetically popping a pill that some random friend gave them.
</p>

<p>
	This is going to create problems. You cannot just assume that he will have a great mystical trip. Many people are not ready for the radical nature of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that you could make his situation worse and you will be blamed for that.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are something you have to really desire to do. You have to have a need for it. You have to proactively seek it out.

<p>
	Yes, but what are you gonna do with your life after awakening?
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose only starts to get serious after awakening.

	It is not ideological unless you turn it into an ideology.
</p>

<p>
	I warned you from day 1 not to turn my teachings into an ideology.
</p>

<p>
	You must use my teachings consciously. How you use them depends on you. Many warnings have been issued.
</p>

<p>
	It would be a good idea to clearly distinguish in your experience what it means to act ideologically and what what it means to act consciously.

	Please don't cite me "spontaneous insight". You have no idea what hell Tolle went through to earn his so-called "spontaneous insight."
</p>

<p>
	He spent 2 YEARS living on a park bench just to integrate it.

<p>
	Your logic is like saying an Olympic champion got his gold medal in a 30 minute ceremony.

	No! You still aren't getting it.

<p>
	You are using an imaginary notion of a "behind the scenes reality" to ground reality.

<p>
	Your are fooling yourself when you do this. You are anchoring reality in a fantasy.

	You might as well believe that there exists a behind the scenes space kangaroo who runs reality. There is as much evidence for space kangroos as there is of a behind the scenes brain.

<p>
	Your are splitting hairs now.

<p>
	In practice you will not get insight without time and deep experience.
</p>

<p>
	If this wasn't true, people would not do meditation retreats or become monks.
</p>

<p>
	The core hypocrisy is this: meditation retreats are treated as necessary and important, yet psychedelics are demonized and dissmissed as ineffective.
</p>

<p>
	This is a clear double standard born of self-bias.

	You are interested in truly questioning your reality. You are more interested in being right.

<p>
	Your sense of rightness is, of course, imaginary. But since you deny this, you're now stuck forever until you decide to open up.

<p>
	Or maybe you can do it faster with psychedelics. Who knows?

<p>
	You answered your own question. If both require space between, the space in between cancels itself out.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so hard to take 100 people, split them into 2 groups, and pay each one to do 5,000 of either psychedelics or meditation. And then see who is more conscious in the end.

</p>

<p>
	When you compare psychedelics vs meditation, you're making a biased comparison.
</p>

<p>
	You are comparing 5,000-10,000 hours of mediation with 50-100 hours of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	A true comparison would be to compare 5,000 hours of meditation with 5,000 hours tripping, or 50 hours of mediation with 50 hours of tripping.
</p>

<p>
	It's very misleading to criticize the limited transformative power of psychedelics when you are comparing a few psychedelic trips with a master mediator who's done 10,000 hours of practice.
</p>

<p>
	The true test is to compare apples to apples. Which of course no meditation teacher does. Because of how bad it would look for them. Meditation is terribly inefficient. The only way to overcome its inefficiency is with a full-time professional commitment. And even then, you will not ever be as conscious as with 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that doing 5,000 hours of psychedelics is unheard of in our society. So no one really knows what it would result in. People are too scared or too closedminded to run the test. Because a visionary leader is needed to pioneer a new spiritual path as the Buddha did with Buddhism.
</p>

<p>
	There is a huge difference between following an existing spiritual path like a sheep vs pioneering a brand new one for others to follow.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's what they would say, but their position is incoherent and circular.
</p>

<p>
	What is your behind-the-scenes reality grounded in? You're not questioning that deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot ground reality in the brain because the brain is already part of what you call reality. This is classic question begging.
</p>

<p>
	It's like saying God is true because the Bible says so. And why is the Bible true? Because God wrote it.

	You don't need to go to some alien planet. Animals on Earth already sleep different amouts at different times of the day. Some animals only wake up at night.
</p>

<p>
	Some animals even sleep through the winter.
</p>

<p>
	This has nothing to do with what time is per se. Regardless of what time is you can sleep whenever you want.

<p>
	Reality is groundless. If you try to ground it in anything, like a brain or atoms, you still aren't getting it. Oneness cannot be grounded in anything but itself because oneness can have no other.
</p>

<p>
	Brains have no absolute reality. They are imaginary. Just like all form is.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple, you cannot ground form in another form. That is delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Discover this for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Brains are a relative duality which we use to speak about relative reality. This concept works, but only up to a point. If you examine it deeply enough you will hit upon a self-reference paradox which results in a strange loop. That's your clue that you've reached the limits of that concept of "a brain".
</p>

<p>
	The strange loop is this: if the universe in happening in brain, then where is the brain happening? In the universe? You can't have it both ways. On the one hand you say that the universe comes before a brain, on the other hand you say the whole universe happens in a brain. Which is it? Is the brain itself happening inside a brain?
</p>

<title>Why Psychedelic Awakenings are Insight 'Experiences' and not Permanent Awakenings</title>

There can certainly be a trap in only hitting peaks but not enough sober embodiment.
</p>

<p>
	The peak of a psychedelic like 5-MeO is so extreme it's very hard to embody it even if you meditate all day. You are never going to hit that same level of consciousness sober. You proabably couldn't live regular life while in so much consciousness.

<p>
	You guys keep forgetting that final twist.

<p>
	If you do not understand that Devil = God, you are not properly understanding my teachings. I've been very explicit about that when speaking of devils. That's what makes my teaching different than classical Christian teachings which separate the devil from God, resulting in a duality. My teaching is nondual.
</p>

<p>
	I don't hate Trump. I merely use him as an example because he's the epitome of ego. I understand exactly why Trump must be Trump and that it cannot be otherwise for him. Trump is just a part of my Infinite Self. I would be foolish to hate myself.

			About 20 years ago I met the woman who I knew was the love of my life, but we were both non-single, and I knew the time wasn't right anyways. 5 years later life brought us back into one another's world. Again, we were both dating other people, but both in unsatisfactory relationships. We had an attraction that was so strong and right that we ended up leaving our partners and coming together. Now we are celebrating 10 years of marriage and beautiful children together. It happens. I feel bad about the hearts we hurt, but we are all friends still, so I think we made the best out of a difficult situation.

<p>
	This is simply false. Imagination isn't limited to sense perception. In fact, sense perception is something you're imagining.
</p>

<p>
	Your critique is based on a lot of daulities of which you are unaware. Dualities such as self/other, self/God, self/world, real/unreal, reality/dream, dream/hallucination, reality/hallucination, human/God, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	All of those dualities are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between your childhood happening and it being imaginary. What it means to say that "my childhood really happened" is that you imagine it did. If, right now, you stopped imagining that you were born, you would cease to have a childhood. But you are so attache to the idea of your childhood and having been born that you refuse to acknowledge it is all pure imagination. I don't just mean that your childhood memories might be faulty or exaggerated. I am your childhood even happened other than in your imagination right now! In fact, there is no difference between the two unless you imagine there to be.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference whatsoever between a dream, a hallucination, and your present experience. You just imagine there is.
</p>

<p>
	What you're not understanding is: What you imagine becomes real. Not in some stupid simplistic sense of imagining a unicorn and it landing in your lap, but in the sense that you are constructing all of reality with your mind, the end result of which is precisely what you see before you. Whatever you see is precisely what you are imagining and you are not conscious of how you do this. This process is extremely sophisticated and infinitely complex. If you imagine that you aren't imagining your childhood but that it was real << that's what you're currently imagining, and that's what becomes real for you! You are creating reality by assuming it! You can't see it because this process of imagination is responsible for imagining you. You have a massive conflict of interest problem here. For you to understand what I am saying you would first have to face your own death. Which of course you have zero interest in doing.

<p>
	The larger goal of Actualized.org is a build up a catalog of powerful videos which people can browse from around the world and find every important topic under the sun.
</p>

<p>
	To achieve this goal I need to release lots of videos.
</p>

<p>
	The priority is not the weekly flow but the overall catalog which is built up over time. These videos are not designed to be watched in a linear sequence. This isn't Game Of Thrones. You are meant to look at a giant catalog of 500 topics and click on those which are relevant to you right now.
</p>

<p>
	It should feel like ordering food at the Cheesecake Factory.
</p>

<p>
	If you've never been to the Cheesecake Factory, it's a restaurant with a menu the size of a book. There's so much to choose from you don't know where to start and it all looks so good.
</p>

<p>
	That's the effect I'm shooting for.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to create this effect if I only release 25 videos per year.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I'm not revealing yet what the new course will be about.
</p>

<p>
	But it will be a course that is useful to 100% of people and my viewers, regardless of where you are on your path. It doesn't matter whether you're into spirituality or not at all, this course will be hella useful to you. It doesn't matter whether you've watched a single Actualized video before, or if you've watched them all. But if you've watched them all, this course will help you to implement it.
</p>

<p>
	It will not be about enlightenment or metaphysical topics.
</p>

<p>
	It will not be redundant to the LP course. Both courses will be useful on their own, and also synergize together.
</p>

<p>
	The new course is not "more up-to-date" because it simply covers different/new material. And the material covered in the LP course is timeless. It will still be useful 50 years from now.
</p>

<p>
	If you're following my free videos, you should also supplement them with more practical, less metaphysical teachings from other sources. Actualized's focus is big picture understanding of life, not so much about making you successful. There are tons of sources available for nitty-gritty success techniques and tips. I offer a bit of that, but it's not our main focus here because that ground has already been well-covered by others and because we seek a deeper level of development than success tips can offer.

<p>
	Just the exposure of Trumpism is already raising consciousness as Trumpism looks so ugly to most people that we as a culture will agree that it's not the right path forward. Of course there will always be some fanatics who refuse to change their mind, but mostly people see that Trumpism is not a workable way forward. Even his own supporters are starting to admit it. You can't deny the obvious forever.
</p>

<p>
	All that's necessary is to shine sunlight on devilry and it will start to dissolve. Trump's whole presidency is that process unfolding.

<title>Difference Between Mystical Experience and Hallucination</title>

<p>
	All experience is a hallucination. It's just a matter of what kind of stuff you're hallucinating. The mind can be highly stable or highly unstable and everything in between. Highly stability does not make a hallucination any less a hallucination. It just creates a hallucination of stability and solidity.
</p>

<p>
	A brick wall is you hallucinating something solid and stable. Take a psychedelic and the brick wall will melt and morph. Then it will return back to solidity. Get shot in the head and the brick wall will cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	Classical psychological hallucinations like psychosis are the result of a less stable mind which tends to play by a different set of rules than ordinary minds. It's more dream-like. More like being on a psychedelic 24/7 but often mixed with ego, fear, and confusion. It's not clear like awakening or meditation. Hence people can hallucinate demons and other things like that.

<p>
	We will still be covering practical topics in the future. A lot of topics remain related to emotional mastery and those will all be practical.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff on business and success too. Relationships too. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	I just have a big backlog of metaphysical and spiritual topics which I've been executing. It won't always be like that. I'm not going to keep rehashing old topics. There's always new stuff to talk about with at least 200 new topics planned.
</p>

<p>
	There will also be a new paid course, which will be the most practical of all. ETA for that is sometime within the next 5 months.
</p>

<p>
	So much work, so little time.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it depends on what my goals are. If what I wanted was a serious relationship and he was actively doing pickup, then probably not. If he is at the point where he's already done a lot of pickup and got it out of his system and was willing to let it go, then that might be ideal. It's every girl's dream to lock down a stud.
</p>

<p>
	Girls hate the guy doing pickup but they love the end-results of pickup if they can lock the guy down at the end of it. Pickup refines the guy and makes him a stronger, more attractive man. Girls love that, but they don't want to know how the sausage was made. They want to assume he's a natural.
</p>

<p>
	It's like, "OMG! You're so good in bed! How did you get this way?"
</p>

<p>
	"Um... you don't wanna know."
</p>

<p>
	Like anything else in life, being attractive requires practice. Highly attractive people tend to have lots of practice.

<p>
	Trump's strength is pure illusion. He's like the Wizard of Oz. People keep thinking he's strong because he got lucky and won once.
</p>

<p>
	If you're a betting man, bet on Trump's luck running out. Never bet against karma. It will catch up to him one of these years. He can't keep dodging it forever. What's amazing is how lucky he's been up to this point. But that won't hold up.
</p>

<p>
	In true poetic style he will end up hoisted by his own petard.
</p>

<p>
	It's foolish to bet on a devil prevailing over the truth in the long-run. A devil's victories are always short and fleeting.

<p>
	It's important to keep in mind that all systems have parasites and exploiters. This is not a condemnation of government per se. It's a fundamental aspect of nature. Parasites have existed for a billion years and will continue to exist for a billion more. This is not a valid excuse to not create better and bigger systems. In fact, this is why better and bigger systems evolve. The better government gets the less parasites will be able to abuse it.
</p>

<p>
	Bigger government is important precisely because its size helps to protect it from large corporate parasites. Government must be larger than the corporations it governs, otherwise things get squirrely.

			Ehh... so then how is nonduality you teach, different from solipsism? I don't get it, you are basically saying it's not solipsism yet only my mind exists??
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	First of all, solipsism is a conceptual scheme, a philosophical system. This is very different from actuality. In this sense solipsism is a fantasy whereas nonduality is actuality. Map vs territory. This is a HUGE difference. Don't underestimate this.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, solipsism is not even a good map. It does not recognize the truth of no-self and the truth that you are God. Solipsism is still dualistic in that it denies the reality of others by upholding the reality of the ego-self. Nonduality makes a more radical move. It denies the reality of all individual selves, especially oneself. If other people are unreal, you as a person must also be unreal.
</p>

<p>
	If you are unreal, then what are you? Solipsism doesn't answer this ultimate question.
</p>

<p>
	The part that solipsism gets right is that ultimately you are all alone. But what are you? You are not a finite being, as solipsism assumes. But when you finally realize that you are an infinite being, you will also realize that you are both alone and together, because infinity includes all dualities. You are so ONE that you cannot even distinguish oneness from twoness!

<p>
	Again, the difference between the two is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	People are imaginary BUT, since everything is imaginary and there is nothing but imagination, people are in this sense as real as anything can be.
</p>

<p>
	From the Absolute perspective people are unreal. From from the relative perspective people can be spoken of as if they are real. When I interact with many of you, I treat you as if you are real because that's helpful for navigating the everyday world of human survival. It would not be appropriate for me to treat the guy at the grocery store as if he was a cartoon character.
</p>

<p>
	But from the Absolute perspective I know that I am the only one here. Yet I don't live from this perspective most of my day as I run chores and do ordinary survival activities. The illusion of other is very strong, even after some awakenings. It's easy to fall back into the illusion of otherness, especially when people behave like dicks.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It doesn't make sense to you because you are interpreting what I say from a dualistic paradigm which assumes a self/other distinction. You are projecting your delusion of duality onto what I say.
</p>

<p>
	I am conscious that other users on here are simply projections of a universal mind. You are not conscious of this. So when I speak to others, I know am just speaking to myself, but you do not know that because your ego is in the way. Your ego will not even allow you to imagine what it would be like to realize that the self/other distinction is unreal.
</p>

<p>
	No matter who I address I am addressing you and I am addressing myself because you, me, and all beings are ONE!
</p>

<p>
	Everyone is the only being in the universe. It's like a massively multiplayer online game where one central server runs all the players. God's mind has fractured itself into a trillion pieces. Or it imagines it has. In truth, nothing is fractured because the distinction between fractured vs whole must itself collapse, leaving behind Absolute Unity. A Unity which has no opposite. The human mind cannot imagine such a Unity because it is too total to allow for a finite mind to exist in it. Within this Absolute Unity there is no difference between your human body, a chair, a kangaroo, a taco, or anything else. All of it blends into ONE. This is the Godhead. This is what you were before you were born as a human self.

	Psychedelics are of course imaginary, just like everything else.
</p>

<p>

Once you drop that assumption, all the sudden psychedelics cease being physical objects and all of your objections fall away.
</p>

<p>
	My claim is not that everything is a hallucination except psychedelics. My claim is that everything is a hallucination, including psychedelics. Which means, when you eat a mushroom, you're not actually eating a physical substance, you're hallucinating eating a mushroom.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between a mushroom, a chair, a house, a tree, your body, your Mom, or Santa Claus. All of them are just different kinds of imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Taking psychedelics helps you to realize this. Yes, it's strange-loopy and paradoxical. As it must be since everything is ONE.

	You just don't want to take them seriously because you've confused the limits of your tiny personal experience for the limits of the universe.
</p>

<p>
	Talk about aliens is very distracting because its gets the ego all defensive and dogmatic, driving it deeper into the materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The surest way to tank your credibility as a teacher is to talk about aliens. You will instantly lose 90% of your audience and be branded a crackpot cult leader. People will laugh at you and call you names. In olden times you would certainly have been burned at the stake for witchcraft and heresy.
</p>

<p>
	That's how closed minds behave.
</p>

If you are a student of nonduality you should know by now that nonduality means oneness.
</p>

<p>
	How can you pursue oneness while maintaining the notion of twoness (self vs other)?
</p>

<p>
	You are not conscious yet of the implications of ONENESS.
</p>

<p>
	It means... you know... that everything is ONE!
</p>

<p>
	Which means you are the only being in the universe.
</p>

<p>
	This does not contradict Rupert Spira. You're just not understanding yet the full implications of Spira's teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse oneness or nondualty with solipsism. Solipsism is not radical enough to be true. And yet, you are all alone.
</p>

<p>
	Technically, the duality between aloneness vs togetherness collapses. But when this happens your ego will perceive it as solipsism. If you're not careful you will reject/deny this important insight of God's existential aloneness because you are so attached to the idea of there being others.
</p>

			This whole "I am God / You are God" movement that's popular in modern day spirituality is incredibly distracting and misleading.

<p>
	It's not misleading, it's simply what's true.

<p>
	Devils have misused spiritual truths for thousands of years and that's not about to change.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Dating and relationships are predicated upon manipulation.
</p>

<p>
	But pickup takes it to the next level.
</p>

<p>
	You can do pickup, the biggest thing to avoid there is the ideology which often comes with the activity.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is not so much that guys do pickup, it's that they develop a toxic masculine ideology to go with it.

<title>Is Death Imaginary?</title>

<p>
	The problem with your reasoning is that it assumes a distinction between self/other, which is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	What dies is the thing you imagined was real -- self or other. But that wasn't a real thing, it was an imagined boundary.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if the imaginary boundary between America and Canada stopped being imagined by all human minds, then America and Canada would both "die". But of course in truth nothing has died because it wasn't real to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	Things "die" when they stopped being imagined.
</p>

<p>
	Which means: if you stop imagining yourself, you will die.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	RSD is enormously manipulative at multiple levels.
</p>

<p>
	Of course manipulation is often critical for survival (which is mostly what you're doing).
</p>

<p>
	The point is to become more conscious of what manipulation is, why you feel the need to do it, and karma/suffering which results from it.
</p>

<p>
	You have a lot of work yet to do to understand the depth of what manipulation is and how much suffering it causes in your life.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with manipulation is not that you're being bad towards other people, per se, but that it's like pissing into the wind. It comes back in your face in ways you're not conscious of yet. Manipulation is not a satisfying way to live. When you manipulate you are selling your soul to the devil for a piece of chocolate cake. Yes, the cake tastes good, but at what long-term cost?

<title>Free-rider problem</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/40618-free-rider-problem/?do=findComment&amp;comment=509087</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The solution to the free-rider problem is to adopt an abundance mindset.
</p>

<p>
	If you are confident in your skills and the value you add to society you don't need to worry about a few poor people enjoying some crumbs that fall off your table.
</p>

<p>
	The free-rider argument is advanced by people with a scarcity mindset who fear that there won't be enough to go around. The truth is that there are enough resources on this planet for every human to be comfortable. If only those resources were shared fairly and not hoarded.
</p>

<p>
	The free-rider problem is also seriously overblown. It's not like the government will supply you with a comfortable living while you sit around and play video games your whole life. People on food stamps and welfare programs are not automatically bums. Many of them are hardworking people.
</p>

<p>
	The true free-rider problem is the free-riding that corporations do when they lobby and corrupt government to get tax-breaks, cushy government contracts, wars, subsidies, and less regulation.
</p>
