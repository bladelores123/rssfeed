<p>
	Of course it is. It was never going to be anything but biased towards Israel.
</p>

<p>
	It's not a deal, it's a joke.

<p>
	Pickup leads to that if you want. Most guys who get into pickup just want to get a nice girlfriend. They are not going to bang 100 girls.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you sleep with 10-20 girls, you get that out of your system, and you settle down with one who's right for you. Not much different than normal social people do.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, people who are social can easily have 10-20 sexual partners, simply because they are so social and have ample opportunities. A hot girl will easily have 10-20 sexual partners in her lifetime. She is fucking around. She just keeps it secret.

<p>
	LOL, you haven't read about how many gurus sleep with their students?
</p>

<p>
	Gurus have optimized pickup so much that they don't even need to go to the club/bar, the girls flock to them. This is the ultimate form of pickup. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. Getting laid as a guru is the easiest thing in the world. Which is a big reason why spiritual communities are formed. If you start a spiritual community you are automatically guaranteed sex. Of course it all turns into a toxic mess soon enough.

<p>
	LOL, how naive.
</p>

<p>
	The "very specific religious purpose" is to bust some nuts.
</p>

<p>
	The people participating are carefully selected to be as hot as possible.
</p>

<p>
	You must appreciate how sneaky the sex drive is. It will not simply lay down and die, even after awakening. It will get crafty.

<p>
	Ralston's awakening came from intense self-inquiry retreats where me contemplated "Who am I?" for 3 weeks non-stop.
</p>

<p>
	And Ralston is a freak of nature. None of you here have his contemplation or focus abilities.
</p>

<p>
	If you only knew how much work Ralston has done, your jaw would drop.
</p>

<p>
	He's done over 10,000 hours of retreats.

<p>
	Again, you guys are only looking at the surface. If you had actually read Suzanne Segal's life story you would know that she spent years doing intense, hardcore TM meditation. She was a high level TM instructor. And THEN her awakening came spontaneously some years after she quit TM.
</p>

<p>
	She mediated for 10 hours a day or more. None of you here have ever done that much spiritual work.

	Fools gold. None of it was spontaeneous. You just don't realize the work that went into it. You are only looking as the end result.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Key word there is "seems".
</p>

<p>
	It seems that way because you don't know how much effort it took.
</p>

<p>
	It took Neale Donald Walch over a year to channel the first book over many sessions. And of course his notes were heavily edited and polished. He did not just sit down and the whole booked poured out of him in one week.
</p>

<p>
	You guys have to be careful with you assumptions. When you see a spiritual teacher or teaching you are only seeing the end result. You have no clue how much work was done behind the scenes and how ugly the work looked.
</p>

<p>
	That's one of the reasons I'm sharing raw footage of my awakening process. It's going to look very messy when it's happening to you. It's not going be like Ekhart Tolle sitting stoicly on a chair. It's going to feel more like you're ready to put a gun in your mouth and pull the trigger. But no one shows you that part.

<p>
	Just the opposite. When the mind is closed, death is its only salvation.
</p>

<p>
	This is a message of highest compassion.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you are welcome to open your mind prior to the death of that mind. God hopes you do. But just in case you don't, God has made sure that that mind will die.
</p>

<p>
	I'm just explaining to you Plan B.

	You don't need to stop dating or having sex to awaken. Many awakened people have sex. In fact I would say most of them.

	Lots of people bring passion and craft to their profession, but they don't get paid $25 million/year for it because they are not throwing balls into baskets. It requires a society which values balls in baskets to pay that kind of money for that kind of activity.

			How do you set a date, dont get anxious in the date as to not making it bored, and then get laid. Or even less, to get out of the needy state while in the date. Or did you just went on a date if you where prepared into the mood? Consciously settings dates while being unconcious is fckng tricky. This is when you start seeing all the glitches in the matrix.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	First of all, you are far more needy than even you admit. Not just with online dates but offline dates too. When the opportunity for good sex presents itself, your mind will start craving it and clinging to it.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you so overthinking this? All you gotta know is: Do you want to have sex with that person? If yes, set up the fucking date and be interested in it, yet detached and non-needy.
</p>

<p>
	How do you become non-needy? By going on dozens of dates with dozens of people until it starts to feel normal.
</p>

<p>
	It also helps to have a decent amount of sex (with one person or many) so that you get your sexual hunger satisfied, at least somewhat. Most men are like starved dogs who haven't eaten in a month. Of course you will be needy for food in that situation.
</p>

<p>
	Look, the reality is, if you're just starting PUA you will be very needy for the first year or two. That's par for the course. Struggle through it and do the best you can. Try to contain your neediness when possible. As you see how your neediness turns off and loses you many hot girls, the pain of those losses will teach you to surrender your neediness more and more.
</p>

<p>
	A human avatar is a finite thing. It is not meant to muck around with the physical laws. For the same reason that Trump is not allowed to rewrite the US Constitution to suit his will. Because his will is the will of a devil.
</p>

<p>
	How would you like it if Trump could materialize a bomb over your head? You'd be here complaining about how evil God is to allow such a thing. Yet when God disallows such a thing, you are here complaining about it. Because you are not clearly thinking through what you're asking. It's like you're a baby playing with a loaded gun, completely oblivious of what it can do. And you complain when your parents hide it from you.

	It can be negative, but it can also be healthy and positive. If you value improving your country for the benefit of all citizens, that's a good thing. If you turn it into nationalism, that's a toxic thing.

<p>
	I didn't want to exclude stage Blue people. Many of them value service to country/culture. Yes, it can become toxic, but doesn't have to.

<p>
	Because there are 1000x less helicopters than cars in that 100 mile area.
</p>

<p>
	Helicopters are an elite mode of transport, like how carriages used to be. If you are the only one driving around in a carriage because you're so rich only you can afford it, then yeah, you'll be very safe. Until everyone else gets a horse-less carriage.

			They're branching out into Spirituality now. I think in 5 years or so Tyler's videos will probably be a bit like the videos you now make tbh. I watched Tyler's latest video recently and its a trippy walk through the woods whilst it goes from day to night talking about karma and shit.
		</p>

		<p>
			To me it almost looks like he has seen your videos and want to do something like them in the coming years. I also get the feeling he might be inspired by the Conversations With God books and wants to use his fame/infamy to do good things in the future with his business. I could be wrong, its just the sense that I got watching his most recent video.<br />

<p>
	It is funny because I got the idea to start Actualized.org from watching Tyler's earliest videos. He was a sort of pioneer of early YouTube marketing.
</p>

<p>
	I even approached him in person back in 2012 to start a self-actualization channel but he was too into pickup back then to go all-in on personal development and spirituality. His plan was to exhaust pickup fully and then go all-in on personal dev. (Or so I think.)
</p>

<p>
	I think deep down he has a good heart and he would make an amazing warrior sage. But he's also got a really massive ego. Hard to tell how that will hash out. I wish him full God-realization. If he ever attains full God-realization he will become a powerful, powerful Bodhisattva and a source of light unto the world. But will it actually happen? That's the question.
</p>

<p>
	My guess is yes, but it will be an ordeal and take a long time.

<p>
	Men have been hitting on women since the dawn of time. It ain't about to stop. It's merely a question of: Will they do it skillfully or unskillfully?
</p>

<p>
	What's more disgusting is online incels who are too afraid to even talk to a woman, blame women, and then go shoot up an elementary school because they can't get laid. But of course even that is not disgusting. It's totally understandable.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate how strong the sex drive is in men. It will not just sit quietly. Either it will be channeled in a healthy way or an extremely unhealthy way. Men who can't figure out a healthy way of getting laid will create social disturbance, start wars and fascist movements. In this sense RSD is helping the world to avoid that.

	I know your struggle. But there's only so much time in the day to teach.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is a journey. You must struggle through it to get it, and then transcend it. Just begin with the mountains of material that's already on YT. You'll figure it out if you try. And enjoy the process. Don't make it just about the results.

		<p>
			Okay, I do agree with what you said here. However, there are a couple of issues I still have with learning good game.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first concern I have is that learning good game still might turn a guy into a stoic being who is forced to mask all of the pain of rejection and uncertainty he has to deal with on a constant basis. What if he reaches a certain point where he can no longer handle anymore rejection from women. Back when I approached hundreds of girls and tried connecting with countless girls on online dating websites and other social media platforms, I got to a point where I felt my self esteem and confident drop so much and I got so exhausted with having to pretend that I was okay with being constantly rejected. I felt so worthless and incredibly frustrated and indignant about dating. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There's always ways you can screw something up or make it into a dysfunction.
</p>

<p>
	You are taking rejection too personally because you're so desperate for success. Your neediness becomes its own hell.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta learn to date in a less needy way.  Go to the nightclub/bar and enjoy yourself for once. Enjoy being there. Enjoy talking to new people. Try not to make it a chore or something you do to get a score.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			The second concern I have has to do with working on my social skills. While it’s all sounds good that being a confident and masculine man is what makes you attractive to women, having strong masculinity and solid confidence isn’t actually enough to date and sleep with a great amount of the kind of women you want. Unfortunately, you need to also have a good level of social skills to achieve the results you truly desire with women. Yes, we all need to have at least an average level of social skills to properly get along with others at least at a normal functioning level, respect other people’s boundaries, acknowledge and comply with authority, read and understand non-verbal cues given by the person or people you’re talking to, act with at least a certain level of dignity, learn how to be kind/sympathetic/empathetic with others, etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, learning social skills is key. It's perhaps even more important and fundamental than dating itself. Your larger goal should be to learn how to socialize effortlessly. This comes with lots of practice. Simply by being more social you will attract lots of women automatically. The biggest reason for incels is that they simply aren't social enough. And Facebook and Reddit don't count as being social here.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			However, what about learning the techniques or methods to be more charismatic such as good story telling, humor/wit, being good at starting a conversation, transitioning conversation topics smoothly, having deep, meaningful conversations that invoke emotions in others, etc.? Wouldn’t learning and practicing all of those techniques eventually turn you into a people pleasing entertainer?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	These are all great things. Yes, master them all. No, learning those things will not turn you into a people pleasing entertainer. It will just make you much more magnetic and comfortable in conversation. You will also enjoy your conversations more, not just with women but with men and everyone.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are good at conversation, conversation becomes enjoyable for its own sake. Then you have the best of both worlds. Women and men will flock to you. Who doesn't love a good conversationalist/story-teller?
</p>

<p>
	Have you ever met a really good conversationalist who drew you in for hours?

	Cars are unsafe not because they are unsafe, but because there is so many of them.

	What devilry is this?!
</p>

<p>
	Of course "you" want a dark theme. Of course! Everywhere the light shines you want darkness.
</p>

<p>
	And are you satisfied with cloaking yourself in darkness? No! You must lure everyone else into your darkness to keep you company.
</p>

<p>
	And you expect to be thanked for this.

<p>
	Clever devil.

<p>
	I didn't create a miracle. But I was so conscious that I could literally change reality simply via infinite imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Like, I could imagine a drop of divine water falling on a sick person's head and healing or awakening him. Because at that level of consciousness it is totally clear that physical reality is just my imagination and I can imagine it any way I want.
</p>

<p>
	I understood how someone like Jesus could heal. He just imagined it.
</p>

<p>
	I'm still toying around with this stuff. Mastering it would take a lot of work.

<p>
	1) It can!
</p>

<p>
	2) Precisely because it is already happpening. Remember, if you ask for an apple, you will get an apple, not an orange. Right now you are so busy materializing apples yet you're asking why you don't have oranges.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is your current state of consciousness is far too low to allow you to change how you are materializing physical reality. If your state was 1,000,000 times higher, you could change that.
</p>

<p>
	I have been so conscious that miracles become possible. But this is not a state I can sustain (yet). It's utterly radical. You are not human any more at those levels of consciousness. People will preceive you as an alien. And they will come after you with pitchforks.
</p>

<p>
	This is dangerous territory, and ripe for abuse.
</p>

<p>
	If there is, I haven't reached it yet.
</p>

<p>
	I would define too much awakening as awakening so high that you are on the brink of leaving the physical avatar permanently. That's where I would draw the line.
</p>

<p>
	Although, if you ever reach that point, would you even care? The only reason to stay behind would be to help others awaken, or maybe if you had young kids.

<p>
	Because compassion. Compassion is never mandatory, but if you are conscious, it naturally comes when you see tragedy.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to care about millions of people who you don't even know exist.
</p>

<p>
	But of course in the absolute sense Kobe's life was no more important than an ant's. But humans are self-biased creatures. And killing a queen ant has an outsized impact on the other ants.
</p>

<p>
	If you think about it objectively, it really is amazing that Kobe got so famous and rich for throwing balls into baskets. That says a lot about what humanity values and our level of development. People don't like to question the obvious.

			Hey Leo, what do you think is the best way to pace yourself when doing all this personal development + Spiritual growth work? I'm pretty new to the forum and I'm quite astonished to read about all the things I don't know about its quite mind-boggling and it feels overwhelming. I'm currently meditating at least once a day for an hour or more and reading as much of the books on the booklist. I feel like slow in steady seems to be the way. 
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's almost impossible to answer that. Everyone's path is so unique. The most important thing is not to do what I tell you, but to go inside yourself, connect with your heart, and listen to what it tells you you should do next.
</p>

<p>
	You want to get good at leading yourself and following your own compass (intuiton and heart). You do this by going into solitude and quiet contemplation, and asking yourself powerful questions that open your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Reading those books and watching videos is a good launching off point. You need to arm yourself with quality information and ideas of what's possible and what's worthwhile to pursue. Don't be afraid to invest a few years just reading, watching, and taking notes. You need a decent vision of where you're headed and why.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, slow and steady is key. Be a tortoise not a hare.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The context of this thread was asking about how gender can be relative. So my response is to point people to the fact that absolutely everything is relative. That's what everything is, pure relativity.
</p>

<p>
	A deep contemplation of what relativity is, is crucial in this work. Maybe give that a try some day.

<title>Could learning game turn you into a people pleaser with low self-esteem?</title>

<p>
	There are right and wrong ways to learn game.
</p>

<p>
	If you're doing good game, your goal is to develop authenticity and inner strength. You're not trying to please the girl at all. If you go in trying to please the girl, that's bad game, and she will smell it and reject you. With good game you're not being fake to trick her into liking you, you're working on yourself as a many to burn off all your fear and weakness so that when she's talking to you, you actually are a highly attractive, strong, valuable man. And then she falls in love. She's not falling in love with a fake or a people-pleaser. If anything, game will make you icy and detached. You will stop caring what people think of you. And then your game will shoot through the roof because women find that so attractive.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, after your entire gaming journey is complete, what you'll discover is that nothing is more attractive than genuinely and FULLY being yourself. That's all game is. But when you start you are so self-conscious and so inauthentic that you have no idea what FULLY being yourself means. Game is a process of a many discovering himself. And then women get attracted like flies on shit.
</p>

<p>
	If you can just be 100% fully authentically yourself without an ounce of fear or embarrassment in front of a hot woman, that's all you need to sleep with her. It really is that simple. But it's also really hard to pull off if you're a socially awkward guy with little dating experience who secrete hates himself for all his flaws.
</p>

<p>
	All you need is to be able to walk up to a beautiful women, look her straight in the eyes like you want to fuck her, and then proceed to have a fun playful relaxed conversation, charged with a tinge of sexual energy. Easier said than done. Real game is about training yourself to be able to do that.
</p>

	RSD was one of the best back in the 2012ish era when I was big into it. Not sure about what they teach today since I haven't watched in a long while.
</p>

<p>
	Was it highly conscious? No. But it worked for getting good with the ladies.
</p>

<p>
	But there are many, many dating and attraction courses and teachers out there. I've studied dozens of different ones. Hard to remember them all. David DeAneglo is a classic. I studied Adam Lyons, David Wygant, Mystery Method (although it's super outdated), and a bunch more that I can't recall now.
</p>

<p>
	The basic theory is very simple: you go to a crowded place where there are many hot women, you see one, you muster the courage to approach her, and you start talking your mouth off. Smile, be playful, strong eye contact, have sexual intent, get good a touching her early without being creepy. Repeat 10,000 times. The rest is fine details. Roll with experienced wingmen who can show you the ropes in-person.

	Actualized.org can never go mainstream. Any politicians associated with me would be viciously smeared, so it's best to keep me away from them.
</p>

<p>
	Mainstream people are never going to accept the things I teach, so their only option will be to smear as a self-defense mechanism.
</p>

<p>
	When you're dealing with politics, you're dealing with appeals to people on a very low-brow, shallow level.
</p>

<p>
	Just look at the backlash Bernie got for Joe Rogan's endorsement. It will would be an order of magnitude worse with me because I say far more threatening things than Joe Rogan.
</p>

But that is an exception, not the norm. In most such cases the wounds will be carried to the grave.
</p>

<p>
	All karma can be overcome. But that's a very tall order for most folks to fill.
</p>

<p>
	And also, you must consider, How deeply were you indoctrinated into Christianity? There are many degrees of it. Some people got it real bad.
</p>

<p>
	Technically I was raised Orthodox Christian. But I got a very mild form of it, and I was too conscious from the get-go to buy that shit. The relativity of religion is too obvious after a certain point of consciousness. It's obviouy not possible for any one religion to be Truth to the exclusion of all the others. Just as it's obvious that English cannot be the truest language. There simply is no such thing.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who thinks Christianty is the truest relgion simply reveals their lack of study and contemplation of other religions. It's pure self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that only Jesus had the highest access to God is comically naive and goes against the very core of what God is -- ONENESS.
</p>

<p>
	It is devirly to claim that anyone has an exclusive or highest access to God.
</p>

<p>
	It is the oldest trick in the book to claim that one's religion is the highest. Children think this way.

<p>
	The Infinite Good is all things. You can't improve it because it is already the sum total of all possible improvements you could think of.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is always Perfect, but you don't see it that way because you are self-biased and are attached to things going your human way. If you surrendered your attachment to life, you would see Perfection everywhere.

<p>
	Now you say, "But isn't that dangerous? I might die!"

<p>
	EXACTLY!
</p>

<p>
	The key is to bite that bullet and not care.

<p>
	I am not denying that you can experience the masculine or feminine, but all of that is relative.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this is the Absolute perspective, but that is what's missing here.
</p>

<p>
	You are still subtly trying to ground reality in that duality, which keeps you from going as deep as you could.

	Sounds to me like in your case it's not just "some", it's a whole fucking truckload. Emotional problems easily manifest as physical problems. In such a case, treating them physically will not bring lasting relief.

<p>
	You're in luck. For females it should be easier because your sexuality is much more in the mind than of the physical act (like most guys).
</p>

<p>
	Via hypnosis I know it is possible to give females a male ejaculatory orgasm: where you imagine having a penis and using it to ejaculate.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of exotic types of orgasms are possible with females via hypnosis, but it usually requires a knowledgeable guy to lead it. Although if you really wanted to you could probably lead yourself. Unfortunately for you ladies there are very few men who you date who have this knowledge or even an interest in it.
</p>

<p>
	I took an entire course on sexual hypnosis.

<p>
	Not ready to reveal such things yet. I think it also varies from person to person. People react differently to the same substances, so it take exploration to find what will work for you.

<p>
	It's not a function of money. They are simply paradigm locked and do not fully understand how relativity works.
</p>

<p>
	They can't help it. Someone who was raised in a Christian household has been so deeply programmed by Christian symbolism from such an early age it's almost impossible to let that attachment go. It forms the kernel of the OS which runs that mind.
</p>

<p>
	Even if one of these Christians turns to Buddhism or explores the New Age, deep in their mind they will still have a resonance for Christian symbolism. Their mind has been imprinted with that karma.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Psychedelics certainly help. There are some which are very erotic which are perfect for this. I got very close to having a female oragsm once. I don't doubt it's possible with more practice. But even if you aren't able to actually have one, just getting close is very powerful and healing as it integrates your feminine side.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise there are other methods like hypnosis and visualization.
</p>

<p>
	Visualization is an extremely powerful tool. You can visualize so hard that you can materialize a diety into your perceptual field. But of course this is not your regular visualization exercise. This is hardcore stuff that requires serious commitment and practice.
</p>

<p>
	I think every guy should try to have at least 1 female orgasm just to open his mind. And don't confuse female orgasm with anal sex. That's not what I'm talking about.
</p>

<p>
	Hehe... yes! Mind raped by God.
</p>

<p>
	Get used to it.
</p>

<p>
	This is why we keep saying you must integrate masculine and feminine. This is very important.
</p>

<p>
	As a male, try to actually experience what a female orgasm feels like and enjoy it. You have to get over this idea that you are a male. You are not male! You are God pretending to be male.

<p>
	Seems like that Sikorsky S-76B has two engines.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, if the upper mechanism breaks I'm guessing that second engine won't do much good.

<p>
	Such a freak accident this was.

<p>
	That's not the real reason. You're not appreciating the relativity of perspective. From the Clinton's perspective they do good for the world. Of course that doesn't excuse some of the bad stuff they do, but they don't do it for money, they do it because they believe that's the kind of governance the world needs, AND it also makes them good money. Of course they aligned those two things in their worldview in a convenient manner. You can disagree with that since you're a progressive. But it's not as simple as doing stuff for money. And don't forget that the Clintons also did a lot of good stuff for the world. Governance is a tricky and dirty business. Don't expect people to have clean records.
</p>

<p>
	It's problematic to look back to the 90's and judge it by today's progressive standards. The Democratic party has evolved a lot. And that evolution sits on an older foundation which was the Clintons. Like it or not that's how progress happens.

<p>
	To be clear, a rock does not have gender unless you project it there.
</p>

<p>
	In truth nothing has gender. Gender is an imaginary category, as all categories are.
</p>

<p>
	If you find gender in a rock, you put it there.
</p>

<p>
	If you find gender in a human, you put it there.
</p>

<p>
	You put everything everywhere. Otherwise it couldn't exist. Because you are God.
</p>

<p>
	But this takes some SERIOUS consciousness to grasp. Nothing short of awakening will do.

	Maybe so, but that ain't fascism, that's corporatism -- a stage or two above.
</p>

<p>
	CNN does speak out against fascists like white supremacy movements. No CNN anchor would equivocate about that. They would call it beyond the pale. They would not spin to justify it, unlike Fox News. Fox News would find some way to defend it.

<p>
	Hangovers could be due to lack of nutrients for the brain. Fuel yourself up with antioxidants and other brain supplements after the trip. I've heard this can really help with MDMA hangovers, which means it should also work on all types of hangovers.

	He did a great job of reproducing himself.
</p>

<p>
	This is when it's good to remember the relativity of reproduction. His biological offspring may be gone, but his impact on society won't be so easily erased.
</p>

<p>
	This will touch the hearts of millions.

	Ugh...
</p>

<p>
	I have always hated helicopters. They are too gimmicky. Could fall out of the sky at any moment.
</p>

<p>
	Quite tragic. He will go down as one of the greats.
</p>

<p>
	Note to all aspiring rich people: when you get rich, don't buy a helicopter.
</p>

<p>
	But I guess lots of people die in cars too. But in a helicopter if that engine goes out, you're truly fucked. There's no gliding your way down.

			"... I need to exercise infinitely more Self - Love. The desire of having a different story - a different life, comes from lack of self - esteem and self - love. Why not experience fully the current story I'm living. Live it, embrace it, experience it. Grow with it, let my consciousness mature the way it has to. The way it really is.

	I am done replying to this thread.
</p>

<p>
	I have spoken the truth. Now it's on you to do the work to get it.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that these are extremely advanced teachings. Treat them with the respect and nuance they deserve. It will take the average person 10 to 20 years of serious inner work to fully fathom what was said in this thread. Sloppiness, laziness, and self-bias just won't cut it here.

<p>
	Mushrooms tend to be one of the few psychedelics which can produce a hangover for me. Long and deep mushroom trips can be exhausting, requiring another day of rest.
</p>

<p>
	Other psychedelics I no hangovers from.

<title>I cannot have a platonic friendship with a woman because I need love!</title>

<p>
	Two basic solutions to this problem:
</p>

<p>
	1) Practice Self-Love. Using visualization, give yourself the love that your wish your mother gave you. Give yourself unlimited love. Give yourself the love you which any woman or girlfriend would give you. Do this for 10 minutes every day for several months. It will make a big difference.
</p>

<p>
	2) Go attract some women and have sex with them. Get a girlfriend.
</p>

<p>
	After you do steps 1 & 2, your problem should be gone. If not, repeat steps 1 & 2.
</p>

<p>
	Politicians digging up dirt on opponents is par for the course.
</p>

<p>
	What's not okay though is if the dirt-digging discovers actual serious dirt.
</p>

<p>
	Like if your opponent discovers you murdered someone, well, that means you're disqualified from the job. It isn't really dirt if it's true that you murdered someone.
</p>

<p>
	The problems with Trump are not merely his sexual scandals and tabloid dirt. It's the fact that he's seriously corrupt as fuck.
</p>
