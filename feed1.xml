	I don't know where you found that nonsense. That is not what I consider proper pickup. Why are you even looking at that when there is so much good material out there?

<p>
	Pickup theory does not apply to women trying to find men. Women need a whole different set of advice and techniques. You can find tons of material specifically tailored to women. Dating advice for women. It is not going to involve cold approaching men on the street asking for phone numbers.

Really, really, really advanced stuff! It took me tens of years of earthly development before I got to the lofty topics I'm now covering. There are many earthly materialistic development topics which I hardly cover at all even though they are very important for the average viewer.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like I'm teaching a college calculus class but you walk in by accident as a 5th grader. You need to handle the basics first.
</p>

<p>
	What most of you guys need is some basic Tony Robbins shit. Do some of that before you try to get all spiritual. Be mindful of getting ahead of your skiis.

<p>
	I'm not sure what this means.
</p>

<p>
	The finite can know the infinite. And the infinite can know the finite. The infinite is not other than the finite.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand spiritual phrasing in their proper contexts.
</p>

<p>
	What Spria might be talking about is the the Absolute formless Godhead which you can think of as sort of disconnected from the formed realm. You could say that it does not know the finite formed realm. But at the same it is also identical with the finite formed realm.
</p>

<p>
	In this context, you have to understand that the word "know" is virtually identical with "be". We are not talking about linguistic knowledge. We are talking about being.
</p>

<p>
	But all of this talk will only confuse you more. You must let all this go and just do the practices. Take a psychedelic to easily see what Spira is pointing to.
</p>

<p>
	It's not the weed, it's one's existential questioning that does the work. The weed is just a lubricant. A lubricant does not do the work by itself, it needs a running engine.
</p>

<p>
	Which explains why most people who smoke weed never realize God. Because their engine isn't running to begin with. They are not existentially questioning reality.

	If you feel like you can die, you're not there yet. Keep going until you're 100% sure you're immortal.

<title>Can low self-esteem make you selfish?</title>

<p>
	Low self esteem people tend to be very insecure, helpless, and needy. They love to play victim.
</p>

<p>
	When you are incapable of meeting your basic needs your entire life becomes dysfunctional and backwards. You are forced to resort to outrageous degrees of selfishness just to maintain your basic existence.

			There's always more to learn and more to be conscious of for the hippocampus. But "enlightenment" is before all that. You already are it all, there's no need to huff and puff to try to reach for something other just seeing that you are the one reaching. I mean look. It would be fun to know but there's nothing that will fill up the illusionary empty hole you keep thinking up when pretending you're somethin else than that which you are..!

<p>
	You misunderstood what I asked you. I was not talking about learning more stuff for the hippocampus. I was talking about being conscious of things which you're still not conscious of.
</p>

<p>
	A little bit of enlightenment is a dangerous thing indeed. Makes for a flippant smartass.

<p>
	The most ruthless Aztecs probably ate the wisest ones.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. And JFK, Gandhi, and MKL were not the wisest people in our culture. Not even close. They were just relatively wise compared to average political leaders. Which is not a high bar. None of them were enlightened. The wisest people in the culture are so wise hardly anyone knows about them.

</p>

<p>
	A) Material = spirit. A truly spiritual person understands this. Notice the duality you are creating.
</p>

<p>
	B) Karma yoga
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of being spiritual is to infuse your everyday life and "material" actions with spirit. Life purpose is nothing else but working from your heart and higher self -- letting Teotl work through you on account having enough wisdom to see through Teotl's many disguises.
</p>

<p>
	What you call "material" is just you admitting, "I can't see Teotl. I am fooled by Teotl." Material is how Teotl appears to those who are not wise enough to see Teotl's pure form.
</p>

<p>
	Go re-watch my Aztec episode. You still have much to learn from it.
</p>

<p>
	Lack of theory is also a trap.
</p>

<p>
	The opposite of a trap, is another trap.
</p>

<p>
	I see so many Zen devils around due to poor or insufficient theory. And of course the first thing those devils do is dismiss the value of reading or theory. How convenient for a devil to not have to read about his own devilry on the pretense that he is "too woke" to read books.
</p>

<p>
	Lol! It's absurd!

</p>

<p>
	You must appreciate how deep this problem goes.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless, Absolute Truth exists and it can be directly comprehended. But not in the way you're trying to do. Not by sitting there and theorizing about it. Truth is precisely not theory.

<p>
	Such conditions often have multiple causes. You must experiment to find what the root cause is for you. Not everyone gets ADD for the same reasons.

</p>

<p>
	Yeah, food is tricky because grabage food is EVERYWHERE and healthy food nowhere.
</p>

<p>
	You must basically cook all your own food if you want to eat clean.
</p>

<p>
	Diet is super important. It's really the foundation. You will not get far with self-actualization without proper diet.

</p>

<p>
	You and I are identical, nothing.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is you're getting too attached to perceptions and forms.
</p>

<p>
	Consider: you could have perceptions of there while I have perceptions over here, yet we are still one. I am still you. In the same way that the entire universe is one thing.

<p>
	You're just talking to yourself in this thread. There's no one here but you.
</p>

<p>
	Do not mistake what I am saying for solipsism. As I have said before, nonduality is not solipsism. It's not that you gf or the demon is unreal. It's that they are facets of universal mind (YOU).

</p>

<p>
	Genetics is just universal memory.
</p>

<p>
	The genetics of a donkey do not allow it to have sufficient consciousness to learn mathematics.
</p>

<p>
	Humans brains have enormous variety. We do not all have one type of brain. Each brain has unique pros and cons. Some are good at linear thinking, others at meditation, others at emotions, others at art, others a language, others at psychic powers, etc.
</p>

<p>
	No one brain does it all equally well. There are real tradeoffs.

<p>
	I was assuming it would get better, not worse. But there's definitely a lot of devilry in that community. Owen has not purified himself of his own devilry last time I checked. He's taking his sweet time. His ambition is his greatest strength and weakness.

<p>
	How much consciousness one can muster definitely depends on genetics and physiology.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is of course prior to genetics. But this means jack if your brain is fucked up.
</p>

<p>
	This is simply not recognized by most spiritual traditons because they are 1000 years older than genetics or neuroscience.
</p>

<p>
	If your brain is filled with lead and mercury, good luck getting enlightened. You'll have ADD so bad you will barely be able to read a book.
</p>

<p>
	The deep problem here is that genetically gifted spiritual people take their own abilities totally for granted, as if everyone has them. No they don't.

<title>Night out rapport</title>

<p>
	The upside of rolling solo is that you grow very fast, as long as you're able to do approaches. If you're going out solo and you're so scared that you don't even approach, then you're not ready for that yet. You need a wingman/friend.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14201-brenzo2/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14201" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14201-brenzo2/" rel="">@Brenzo2</a> You mean you're in a relationship but you want to build your pickup skills at the same time? That's hard. In practice, once you get in a comfortable relationship your pickup skills will suffer. There's a trade-off.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4468-joel3102/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="4468" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4468-joel3102/" rel="">@Joel3102</a> Yes, it certainly is, but it's going to take much more work than you imagine at the outset. But the upside is that it will also be much more rewarding (in terms of growth) than you imagine. To really get good at pickup you need to hit it hardcore for a couple of years, approaching 5000+ people. You need to take it very seriously. A half-assed attitude will not work here. You basically need to rewire and retrain much of your mind. Attraction is extremely counter-intuitive. It will shock you. You'll be in for some rude awakening. It will be emotionally difficult. But it will grow you like crazy. If you do it, don't do it for the sex, do it for the stronger man it makes you. It can also be very fun and exciting compared to sitting at home and playing Fortnite. Doing pickup hardcore makes you feel ALIVE! It makes you feel like a hero on his journey towards manhood.
</p>

<p>
	I highly recommend handling this part of your life. Just don't be a douche, don't hurt women, and don't develop an ideology or identity around it.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get serious about learning this skill set, you must bite the bullet and move to a large city with great nightlife and lots of hot girls. LA, NYC, Chicago, Miami, Austin, Vegas, London, etc. It's very worth it. Don't be trying to learn pickup in some redneck part of the world. You need volume to practice on. If you're not willing to relocate, you're not very serious about it.
</p>

<p>
	But at the same time, don't make excuses if you can't relocate immediately. Begin wherever you're at and make plan to upgrade your situation.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is not just about attracting girls. Pickup is about upgrading your entire lifestyle. It's about better nutrition, better fitness, better apartment, better decor, better cloths, better haircut, better friends, better car, better everything. Transform yourself into an attractive fucking man with an awesome life such that a woman would be itching to be around you. Shed your old childish ways. Become awesome. When you become a truly awesome, valuable man, guys and girls will flock to be around you. This is not some gimmick. You are actually becoming awesome. It's a total makeover.
</p>

<p>
	But also don't get lost in it. Return to spirituality once you've completed that phase of your life.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. There are always limits to everything a human does. Don't let that stop you from being awesome. You don't need to sleep with 100 girls. You don't need to become the Michael Jordan of pickup. You just need to become decent and score a few girlfriends. Which basically any guy can do.
</p>

And the closer you get the Truth, the more the mind resists.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be spirituality without self-discipline and training.
</p>

<p>
	There is no magic trick for avoiding this. It must be faced. Which grows you in and of itself.

The good news is you're actually way ahead of the curve because you've already found the most important thing: the field of personal development and spirituality. Most people won't find these fields until they are 30, 40, or 50 years old.
</p>

<p>
	Since you're only 17 you've got many many years to resolve all those issues.
</p>

<p>
	I have made multiple videos where I give a blueprint of how to begin doing personal development and I give long lists of techniques.
</p>

<p>
	Just pick a thing and start working on it. Focus on whatever your heart wants most. If it's girls, then go chat up girls. A very simple exercise is to go to the local mall on the weekends and start trying to have conversations with shop clerks. Try to chat them up. Don't even hit on them, just chat with them. Try to make the conversation last for 5, 10, 15 minutes. Try to make them laugh.
</p>

<p>
	After practicing that for a few months, then start applying those exact same skills at school by approaching random girls at lunch. Girls you don't know. Just teach yourself how to socialize. You don't even need pickup skills at this point. Learn to have conversations with strangers. Learn small talk. Learn eye contact. Learn how to talk about yourself. Learn how to tell interesting stories. Learn how to smile. Learn how to project your voice. Learn how to be friendly.
</p>

<p>
	All of this stuff has been written about in books and talked about in videos ad nauseam. Just go apply it. Break it down into small actionable steps.
</p>

Or at least they will not believe that self-love can help because they think they need other-love.
</p>

<p>
	So can you? Yes.
</p>

<p>
	Will you? I wouldn't bet on it.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to crawl before you fly. Self-love is much harder than finding someone else to love you. Self-love requires a lot of maturity and consciousness to execute.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't it true that you hate yourself? Think about what it would take to never hate yourself again.

You're always just relating to your own needs, the way that person fits into your life. The relationship is always about you relating not who she is, but to your fantasies of what you want and need her to be. But the actual her never lives up to your fantasies so you try to change her over and over again, which still doesn't work, until eventually you give up and leave.
</p>

<p>
	YOU ARE ALWAYS RELATING TO YOUR OWN EGO! Not to what is actual. You don't give a rats ass about what is actual. You want to live in a fantasy. But you want it to feel like its real. So you just call your fantasy reality.
</p>

<p>
	EVERYTHING YOU DO IS YOU MAINTAINING YOUR OWN FANTASY. Every thought you have and every emotion you feel is part of this effort. Notice this. Then maybe you can learn how to relate to things actually.
</p>

	Lol

<p>
	Your logic is like this:
</p>

<p>
	Doctor: "Bob, you've got psychosis. You are hallucinating demons."
</p>

<p>
	Bob: "But doctor! How could that be so? Hold on doc, let me check. Hey, demon! Come here. Now answer me truthfully demon: You really exist right? I can trust you right?"
</p>

<p>
	Demon: "Yes, of course you can trust me Bob. I'm totally real. I would never lie to you."
</p>

<p>
	Bob: "Ah good. I knew I wasn't crazy. See doctor! I'm not crazy. I asked the demon and it assured me that it's real and it sounded convincing. So what's going on here doctor? How do you explain it?"
</p>

<p>
	Demon: "Don't trust anything the doctor says Bob. Better yet, maybe you should just kill him. After all, he's clearly a bad doctor if he thinks you're crazy. If you don't kill him, this doctor might harm many innocent patients like yourself over his long career. So yeah, it's best if you kill him and make a soup out of his remains. There's good nutrition in those bones. Would be a shame to let those juicy bones go to waste. Quickly now! Just bonk him over the head with this hammer."

<title>What made the “legends of enlightenment” different?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31893-what-made-the-%E2%80%9Clegends-of-enlightenment%E2%80%9D-different/?do=findComment&amp;comment=373796</link>

<p>
	Contemplate how many thousands of people even greater than Jesus, Buddha, and Mahavira lived and died, but you never knew about them due to lack of marketing.
</p>

<p>
	The things you know about you only know about for one reason: someone marketed the shit out of them. Not because they are the best.
</p>

<p>
	What made them different was that they were genetically predisposed to it. They are freaks of nature, like someone who is 7 ft tall. Good luck beating him at basketball. Mental capacities are correlated to the brain. You are never going to get a donkey to understand trigonometry.
</p>

<p>
	And now, for those of you who are eager to turn what I said into a victim mindset about how you can't achieve enlightenment. We'll that's nonsense. You can. You're just making excuses. It would be like arguing that you can't play basketball since you're not 7 ft tall. You don't need to be 7 ft tall to play basketball. Will you be the best basketball player in the world at 5ft tall? No. But being the the best in the world is an ego trip. Let it go. Just be the best that YOU can be.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to be Sadhguru or Buddha or Christ. Be you.
</p>

<title>Combining Spiral Dynamics with my geography class</title>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not a good model for explaining in 15 minutes. You're gonna feel very rushed and people will not really understand it in that short a time. It's likely to confuse them or misinform them.
</p>

<p>
	For example, calling the USA Blue is far too simplistic and will lead to incorrect conclusions. Spiral Dynamics needs to be complex because it's describing very complex phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps choose a different topic.
</p>

	Besides being good on policies a politician needs to be charismatic, able to rally people behind him, and excite his base.

Does the person you're voting for really have a chance of winning? Will your donation go to waste?
</p>

<p>
	Simple-mindedly voting for the highest stage candidate is not good enough. Because society might not be ready for stage Yellow yet, or because stage Yellow might not be the right counter-balance to stage Blue & Orange in the way that stage Green might be. You have to consider all these nuances. There are many stage Yellow people in the world who would not make for effective politicians or who might not introduce significant enough policy proposals. Dealing with the hardcore right in this country is not easy. You have to know how to drive a hard bargain. Meeting them half-way often doesn't work so well (as we saw with Obama). Sometimes a good battle is necessary to bring the losing position into collective awareness.

<p>
	Spiral stages are equal in the absolute sense but are inferior/superior in the relative sense.
</p>

<p>
	Just like drinking pure spring water is relatively better for a human being than drinking water from a public toilet. But in the absolute sense, the toilet water is no worse than spring water.
</p>

<p>
	The value of water is RELATIVE to the health of a human being. So it is important IF you care about human health. It is not important in the absolute sense.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to politics and issues of governance be careful not to adopt too much of an absolute perspective, since politics is a question of pragmatic solutions for issues of survival. Poliltics requires a pragmatic eye. What will actually improve peoples lives? What will put mankind in harmony with our environment? Taking an absolute stance on such questions is a mistake.
</p>

<p>
	For example, naive people pursuing nonduality might wrongly conclude that after enlightenment voting no longer matters because they are now so above politics. So they stop voting. But then that action might lead to a facist getting elected and starting WWIII or outlawing spirituality. There cannot be a decent society without voting. Good luck getting enlightened in North Korea. It is not enough to just get enlightened, you must also help to create a society where other people can get enlightened like you did. It is not right to say, "Well, I'm enlightened now, so fuck ya'll." Because you would have never gotten enlightened if all enlightened people took that attitude. The path to your awakening was laid by millions of people working for thousands of years to create a society which would allow it. So it would be kind of you to return the favor.
</p>

<p>
	Remember the important role that balance plays in earthly life. The point of politics is to get our collective balance right, so we don't fall into collective disease.
</p>

<p>
	No one is above politics. Not as long as you care about living. By not voting, you've cast your vote for the status quo.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is irreducible -- since it is the only thing there is. What changes is your degree of consciousness. You need to get an experiential hit on what degrees of consciousness are. Psychedelics are the easiest way to do that.

<p>
	Classic newbie mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Your own mind will trick you like that and get you to believe that having fun with your friend is accomplishing something. It isn't. Fun is fun. But it's not enough to get you the skill set you want.
</p>

<p>
	You must force yourself to approach 10-20 sets each night. No excuses. It's best to start approaching immediately upon walking into the club. The first girl you see, you approach.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why when you get a bit more experience and comfort, you should hit the clubs solo. Solo you can really do some damage in the club. Hanging to your friends too tightly will not allow you to get laid. You must be ready to break off from your friend to approach girls, and bounce them to new locations. It is not enough to just approach a girl and stand with her in the same spot the entire night. Once she's attracted to you, you've got to bounce her as much as possible around the place and then outside the place to other places and ultimately to your apartment. Pickup does not work without leading and bouncing.
</p>

<p>
	Solo is highly efficient. But it's emotionally hard, because when you're out of set you feel very alone.
</p>

<p>
	Your typical girl probably goes to the club a few times a year when her friends drag her along.

	The EEG machine itself is fairly cheap: $800. But the software, accessories, and training materials will cost another $1,500 at least.

<p>
	You are forgetting to reflect your own logic back in on itself: your own logic is a hallucination which you are unwittingly trusting.
</p>

<p>
	You are assuming an anchor point for reality, but there isn't one. Whatever you regard as "real" isn't actually so except in your own mind.

<p>
	It's very technical to learn. Most people will not figure it out, and it is not easy to explain. Which is why I don't talk about it much.
</p>

<p>
	Took me a month of tedious research to figure it out.

<p>
	The very first cave paintings, the earliest human art, was psychedelic shaman art.

<p>
	Very interesting.
</p>

<p>
	Increasing beta is not right though. You want beta to be as low as possible and alpha as high as possible. That's what meditation does.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, coherence is super important.
</p>

<p>
	Gamma is also important.

</p>

<p>
	Let's apply your logic to the USA. How come Donald Trump is putting children in cages and bombing the Midde East when we have people like Eckhart Tolle, Adyashanti, and Peter Ralston teaching nonduality?
</p>

<p>
	How come we have Catholic priests molesting children when the truth of nonduality is readily available in thousands of YT videos?
</p>

<p>
	Every culture has vast diversity, from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high.
</p>

<p>
	The wisest people are never in charge, never in politics, never mainstream.
</p>

<p>
	And don't forget stages of development. Although the Aztec shamans accessed nondual states they were not high on the Spiral. They were mostly Purple, Red, and a bit of Blue. A stage Red person may access a mystical state and then cut out your heart and eat it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry about it. Handle your basic survival needs. Later you will shift your balanced back to spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	You can only do whatever your ego will allow you to do. If your basic needs are severely under-served your ego will not allow you to seriously pursue spirituality. Your heart must in whatever you're doing. If your heart is telling to go fuck, then go fuck. Get it out of your system.

It's highly unusual. Girls will do it, but it's not something they do on the regular. You have to really make it smooth like magic. It is highly unnatural to have sex with a person so quickly. Usually a girl would know a guy for weeks or months or years before she would sleep with him. Simply due to the social circumstances of meeting new people.

That's the right attitude. He's just being too creepy and no charm.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, you gotta be an approach machine. High volume. You fish using a net, not a single hook.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta be persistent like he is, and you gotta have a light-hearted attitude. Notice how he doesn't judge himself or even register rejection. A rejection is literally nothing. He's just having fun and taking it easy. That is absolutely essential. You cannot take this shit seriously. You basically must place zero investment in the girl until she's ready to sleep with you.

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I don't really actively talk about it unless they ask me, which they rarely do.
</p>

<p>
	My Mom is pretty tolerant of me doing whatever, even though she basically thinks I'm crazy.
</p>

<p>
	My brother is pretty open to it because his wife is pretty heavy into spirituality and he's had some mystical experiences on psychedelics. But mostly he's stuck in stage Orange materialism and scientism. He's open to it in theory, but not motivated to do any actual practices. Recently I introduced him to the Spiral Dynamics model and he found is interesting from a sort of scientific and historical POV.
</p>

<p>
	My Dad I don't communicate with at all for others reasons.
</p>

<p>
	My ex-girlfriend was a bit into it but the metaphysical stuff was just way over her head. Although she loved the psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter. Just do your spiritual work and mostly keep it to yourself or some close friends who are also into it. Definitely do NOT expect your family to be into it or to understand it or to support you in your spiritual journey. Your family wants you to be the old you. They don't want you to be enlightened because it would freak them the fuck out. They cannot handle the mindfuck of you becoming immortal. It is just totally outside their reality. They want to feel like The Matrix is real.
</p>

<p>
	A great way to scratch the itch of sharing is to find a girlfriend or boyfriend who's also into self-actualizing and spirituality. Then you can go real deep with it together. That will be a wild fun ride. But it requires the right person, not just some rando.
</p>

<p>
	There is no cure for closedmindedness. Other than to open one's mind.
</p>

	You should take them off at night when you sleep.

A girl rejecting you is not a bad experience. Did a girl stab you with a knife? Then I might understand you'd be hesitant.
</p>

<p>
	You are just being weak and playing victim.
</p>

<p>
	You need to take massive action to solve this problem. This requires going out over and over again hundreds of times. Try to enjoy it. Some night you will cry. It's difficult but also rewarding.
</p>

<p>
	It helps to find some friends and wings to roll with. Solo is doable but pretty hard for a newbie. You REALLY have to push yourself when you're solo.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with kids these days is that they have no sense of work ethic. They don't know how to discipline themselves to achieve a big result. You expect everything to be handed to you, otherwise you think it's impossible. Like if I took you by the hand, sat you in the car, drove you to the bar, put you into a good mood, and pushed you to approach girl after girl after girl, and told all your sticking points and all the right ways to deal with girls, you'd have success. But you're not motivated enough to do all that by yourself, to figure it out by yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You have to learn to lead yourself and to be a creative problem-solver. All the resources you could possibly want for learning how to approach and date hot girls is available online. Much of it is free or very affordable to purchase. But see, you're not making use of it. You're not even appreciating that 20 years ago none of this information was available. It was basically unheard of and impossible 20 years ago. But today it's all free knowledge. And yet still you don't put it to use. 20 years ago you would have paid a million dollars for this knowledge.

Just start by doing your research and be open to finding new stuff.
</p>

<p>
	But also, if you were really serious you could get a job and save up $2k-3k pretty fast. You have to be open to trying stuff and doing what it takes to get results. Don't lock yourself into a victim mindset. There are many ways to solve problems.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe you could even volunteer in a neurofeedback facility in exchange for them letting you use their machine. It costs them nothing to let you use it.
</p>

<p>
	Get creative.

<p>
	Neurofeedback is definitely no placebo.
</p>

<p>
	I use my EEG machine to meditate every day. It's about 10x-100x more effective at meditation than without it. No joke. You feel it after 1 hour.

<p>
	I don't regret spending $3000 on it.
</p>

<p>
	It's a truly amazing tool, but too expensive and too technical for most people to self-operate it. It took me over a month of technical study to learn to use it properly. But now I get to use it for the rest of my life easily, for free. Strategic thinking FTW!

<p>
	I heard it on a podcast from a psychedelic-researching neuroscientist (can't remember his name or the podcast). He did brain scans which showed the brain rewiring itself and a build-up of tolerance which never fully goes away.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA changes how the serotonin in your brain works. At least that's what he said. Of course I don't have direct experience of that.
</p>

<p>
	To stay on the safe side I would not do more than 10 trips of MDMA unless I hear new research to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA causes your brain to dump massive amounts of seritonin (which is what gives you that pleasure high), and then the subsequent crash. You don't want to fuck up your brain's serotonin levels or regulation pathways.
</p>

<p>
	I'd rather stick to LSD, mushrooms, and 5-MeO-DMT -- which seem much safer.
</p>

	If it's so severe that you're unable to function like normal people, there's a good chance it's physical.

<p>
	I have been working on improving my own health lately (thyroid issues) and I've been reading about how ADD is correlated with heavy metal toxicity. It's probably not the only factor, but it is definitely 1 of the factors. I'm not sure what all the factors are. You'd have to research that more. Don't expect conventional Western medicine to have a proper root cure for ADD. You'll have to look more to the fringes.

			The main thing that I guess gives me paranoia about neurofeedback is the cost for sure because there are tons of neurofeedback places here in SF. Honestly, my dad doesn’t really want to help me with my psychological stuff now and given that neurofeedback centers tend not to take insurance, they do seem to cost a fortune of money which I don’t have. I also feel like he’s put off because the evidence for this stuff is very much anecdotal (despite me telling him all the flaws with that view and him brushing it off as new agey self help nonsense).

<p>
	Yes, they can be expensive. Usually $100/session or so. But also permanent improvements can come from just 10-20 sessions.
</p>

<p>
	Health ain't free. It can be a good investment. If it actually helps you, you can earn that money back simply from increased productivity.
</p>

<p>
	But you'd have to weigh the pros and cons of that for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I invested $3000 in my own brain training machine. But I'm sorta hardcore and I got money to burn.

If you have serious ADD you might want to research ways of curing that first before you tackle other things.
</p>

<p>
	From what I understand, ADD is often caused by heavy metal toxicity due to impure diet and water.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I'd get a heavy metal toxicity urine test done to make sure you don't have elevated levels of mercury or lead.
</p>

<p>
	I would also check other vital blood work stats to make sure you're not vitamin D deficient, thyroid deficient, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And if all of that came out good, then I would look into EEG neurofeedback training. That's quite effective for ADD. You can find treatment centers all around in San Fran.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I'd spend some serious time researching the root cause of your ADD. Find the best books on ADD treatment and read them. Visit some ADD forums. Find cases of people who successfully cure ADD and follow their steps until you resolve your condition.
</p>

<p>
	ADD could be physically caused. It could also be psychological. And it could also be both at once. So you must look at physical solutions as well as psychological solutions (like meditation).
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is a great practice for reducing monkey mind.
</p>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/232-preetom/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="232" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/232-preetom/" rel="">@Preetom</a> Yes, that's precisely what I'm telling you. 2000 years ago Jesus could have owned slaves and no one would have batted an eye.
</p>

<p>
	Your definiton of enlightenment is literally con-fused. You are conflating states of consciousness + stages of development + lines + types + morality + personal development + emotional awareness + the shadow + mastery.
</p>

<p>
	All of the above must be carefully distinguished from one another. Otherwise your definition of enlightenment becomes so grand that no human on Earth qulifies as enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is NOT moral perfection. Nor is it development. Nor is it emotional mastery. You will have to work on all of that post-enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is strictly only one narrow thing: direct consciousness of Absolute Truth. Nothing else.
</p>

<p>
	It is as though you are defining surgery as the cure to all ills and I am telling you that surgery will not cure all ills but you are insisting it must. This is a dangerous attitude because there will be many ills which surgery cannot cure, so you will then be forced to repress these ills in order for your definiton to be true. And so you will be sick without knowing why.
</p>

<p>
	Waking up does not cure you of dysfunctions which depend on the structure of your mind. Waking up merely detaches you from giving a fuck about the dream. Within the dream rules still apply to you. Hence why you will not be perfect, you can still be addicted to alcohol or rape a woman or own a slave. You can still be ignorant of relative truths and believe in false conspiracy theories. You can still fail to acknowledge the validity of other spiritual traditons. You can still have anger problems. Because all of this relates to the formed dream realm.
</p>

<p>
	The dream realm has importance. You cannot just neglect it unless you are okay will all hell breaking loose.
</p>

<p>
	That is precisely incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	What you call phenomena is actually Absolute Truth, not human perception, and it is not subjective. You think it subjective because you believe you are a human.
</p>

<p>
	Without ego, subjectivity gets recontextualized into the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	There never was subjectivity! It was an illusion.
