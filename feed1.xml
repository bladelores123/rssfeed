<p>
	Don't try to become one. Just expose yourself to stage Green people, books, videos, ideas, events.
</p>

<p>
	You don't want to adopt a New Age identity. You just want to learn from it.
</p>

<p>
	The system is: you take 5-MeO
</p>

<p>
	And cope with the aftermath.

<p>
	It's a super-important principle of life, the misunderstanding of which creates most of life's suffering.

</blockquote>

<p>
	When I say the answer to all koans is Mu, I mean the ACTUAL Mu, not the word or the idea of it.
</p>

<p>
	Saying Mu while in ego-consciousness is pointless. You must speak Mu from Mu-consciousness. This is what the Zen master is testing for. Are you speaking from Mu-consciousness? Is Mu actual for you?
</p>

<p>
	Only if you are awake is Mu actual.
</p>

<p>
	When you are in Mu-consciousness, you will not even need to speak Mu to the master. Just looking at your face, he will know.

<p>
	Because all that anyone ever really wants, is love. The love of God which they are too scared to give themselves. So they seek shallow substitutes from external sources.
</p>

<p>
	Love is the greatest high in the world. It makes the ego feel complete.
</p>

<p>
	All you ever want in life is to feel complete. But this impossible for the ego to feel constantly because the ego is partial and incomplete by definition. So it steals love in little bits because it is not strong enough to love the entire world.
</p>

<p>
	What the ego misunderstands is that what it really wants is not to receive love, but to give love.
</p>

<p>
	That's correct.
</p>

<p>
	In the end you will be left in a profound state of not-knowing. That is enlightenment. It's counter-intuitive: You expect to gain knowledge, but you end up losing it. What you gain instead is being.

<p>
	They are pretty silly. In the end you're just better off wondering: What is existence? or What am I?
</p>

<p>
	The koans will make sense only after awakening.

	You already did. You have existed as all creatures at all times ever.
</p>

<p>
	Since there is only one consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And here you are experiencing what it's like to be this particular human creature. Tomorrow this human dream will end and some other will begin.

	Depends on how long and how deep you do it.
</p>

<p>
	If you do it deep enough, all of reality will dissolve.

<p>

<title>Teal Swan‘s enlightenment</title>

<p>
	A total disidentification is hard to achieve in pratice. Most people who have some kind of awakening will not fully realize the extent of the Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	A realization of no-self is not the end of the game. There is yet deeper.
</p>

<p>
	I have no idea about Teal Swan speficially, I'm just speaking more broadly.
</p>

<p>
	I think many paranormally inclined folks have a hard time fully transcending the subtle paranornal realm. But in the end, it is all still form. Just a subtle version of the gross material realm.
</p>

<p>
	There is the gross material realm, the subtle realm, and then finally what is called casual nondual. At the very end all identification of any kind is erased. But how many people will actaulize that? Not many.
</p>

<p>
	It is definitely possible to realize that you were never even born. By that point, what is there to identify with? Your ultimate nature is pure emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	But of course it's still great to do stuff like introspection a out your personality, or to integrate shadow aspects, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Psychological work is still very useful for everyday life even though it is not your true ultimate nature.
</p>

Including me! There are many woke people who have no paranormal abilities.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever the reason, paranormal abilities are rare. Not ultra rare, but rare. Only certain kinds of people get them. Of course there are methods for increasing your chances of unlocking them.

</p>

<p>
	A nonlinear system is deterministic but has so many variables that it is impossible for any human or machine to model or predict in detail. Such systems behave chaotically but are still fully deterministic.
</p>

<p>
	The weather is one example of a nonlinear system.
</p>

<p>
	A double pendulum is probably the simplest example.
</p>

<p>
	Almost all interesting and significant systems are nonlinear.

</p>

<p>
	Self-inquiry requires strong focus and a fairly silent mind to work. Many people are not there yet.
</p>

<p>
	You might want to experiment with another method if self-inquiry feels stale.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is the most effective method I have found aside from psychedelics. It is more powerful than self-inquiry in my experience.
</p>

<p>
	Mindfulness with labeling as described in my Mindfulness Meditation video is also very effective and easy for newbies to start.

Do not think, just stare and enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
	Repeat every day.
</p>

<p>
	That is the straightest path to enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	As you stare wonder what existence is. But do not let the mind talk too much about it. Just wonder and stare. No philosophy, no stories, no theories, no science. Just stare at the existence of your hand!

	There is nothing to create a wall between something and nothing. So they are identical.
</p>

<p>
	But this cannot be simply understood logically. You must have a deep awakening to it.

<title>Leo, can 5-MeO awaken paranormal powers?</title>

<p>
	5-MeO is a cutting edge technology. The research on it is still very scant.
</p>

<p>
	You must experiment and see what you get.
</p>

<p>
	It probably can for the right person. Paranormal capacities seem to be very genetically determined. It's a bit of a lottery and most people will never get them.

<title>Spiral Dynamics Development / Growth</title>

</p>

<p>
	Now to answer seriously:
</p>

<p>
	As the recent episode explained:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Lines of development
	</li>
	<li>
		Center of gravity
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	When you take those two points into account you can see how you might feel higher in some areas and lower in others.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like cognitively you are more towards Yellow because you are very openminded. This is great.
</p>

<p>
	But in other lines you proabably still need lots of work.
</p>

<p>
	I was highly Yellow cognitively even in my late teens, but grossly underdeveloped in almost all other lines, and even my cognitive Yellow was weak compared to where it is now.
</p>

<p>
	There can be a big difference between just skimming on the surface of Yellow vs having a solid castle built on Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	What few people appreciate is the enormous depth there is to explore at each stage. There is so much to Orange, Green, and Yellow that you could study and practice each one for a decade each and still no know it all.
</p>

<p>
	Not that you should strive to know it all. Don't become a perfectionist about it. Work on those parts of yourself which give the biggest return on investment. As you develop enough in one color you will stat to see diminishing returns until finally you're just over that stage.
</p>

<title>Leos idea about how we create ALL of our own suffering is ridiculous</title>

<p>
	You are mistaking this claim for a merely psychological one, when it is a metaphysical one.
</p>

<p>
	It requires a massive expansion of consciousness to realize. It is not something to believe but something you will discover after awakening, and ONLY after awakening.
</p>

<p>
	A life of zero suffering is impossible to conceive without awakening. Period. Ego cannot go there because it fundamentally believes that death is 1) real, and 2) bad.

A full expansion of love is equivalent to saying, "I die". And with that your identity disappears, you die, and you realize nirvana. You die into an infinite ocean of pure love. You realize that death is nothing other than pure love! What you've feared and avoided your entire life is just infinite love. Because it was too much for you. Literally. Pure love precludes the possibilty of drawing any boundary between you and anything else. Pure love is the end of all boundaries. You literally give up so much of yourself that it kills you. And you are happy to do it.
</p>

<p>
	Without an identity, the only thing that remains is an ocean of love.
</p>

<p>
	The ego deperately wants this ocean of love, but it is terrified of losing itself in the process. So it is caught in a tragic, impossible bind.
</p>

<p>
	The ego does not realize yet that the ego itself is the only obstacle. Therein lies the tragedy of the struggle. All your life you have been the Devil struggling against and denying God's infinite love. In your arrogance you have rejected your true nature as God. You like being a devil. You fear what would happen to you if you surrender your devilry.
</p>

<p>
	To the Devil, God's radiant light burns and stings like sunlight on a vampire.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move is to just walk right out into the light. But good luck convincing a vampire to do that. That would take a radical leap of faith <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> 
</p>

<p>
	In the end, the Devil will ALWAYS return to God. Because the Devil IS God! It's only a question of time.

<p>
	Yes and no. Part of the challenges of being in a group-think bureaucracy is that you must then follow their rules to survive in that ecosystem or risk getting excommunicated. As a result, academics often consign themselves to be slaves of the system. They are not in a position of power to challenge rules and norms, so they just end up accepting it as "reality". Of course not always. There are plenty of exceptions here and there.
</p>

<p>
	But many of the most advanced humans end up leaving academia because they need a more stage Turquoise ecosystem.

	Temporary states of depression are very common, especially in young people. The key is not to overact to them. They will blow over and you will feel better.

<p>
	Except humans don't really choose anything. We are like robots too. It's just that human action is so complex that no one is able to map out or compute all the variables linearly.
</p>

<p>
	When the neural network becomes complex enough -- with trillions of variables -- it will be able to fold in on itself, model itself, and rewrite itself in unforeseen ways.
</p>

<p>
	Humans don't have to be able to rewrite their entire biological survival mechanism to do novel things. The human psyche is robotic in many ways. But it's in a chaotic equilibrium which gives it enough variety and complexity to be creative.
</p>

<p>
	The human brain is like a chaotic robot. We just need to make these AIs more complex, more interconnected, and more chaotic. Then they will take on a life of their own. At least that's what I'd bet my money on if I was a gambling man.
</p>

<p>
	It makes a lot of sense to be me that humans are just an evolutionary stepping-stone to living AI, the way early hominids were for humans.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see why there would be a fundamental boundary between biological creatures and AIs since the substance of which they are made is ultimately one: consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The entire universe is alive. This I have realized directly.

<p>
	I would just call it the academia paradigm. If you've been in academia or been around professional academics -- they love to think the same way, talk the same way, write the same way, dress the same way. It's group think. It's very much a specific kind of sub-culture with a shared set of values.
</p>

<p>
	Sort of like how Silicon Valley has a certain kind of sub-culture, set of values, and set of assumptions about life. All of which constitutes a paradigm, POV, or interpretive framework.
</p>

<p>
	Every paradigm or POV is blind to its own biases, values, and assumptions until you step out of it and observe it from the outside. Every paradigm takes itself to be the sum total of reality, which it never is because the map is never the territory, and the territory is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	This is a very deep epistemic problem, not merely a problem of universities or Silicon Valley or Hollywood.
</p>

That is a highly speculative hypothesis proposed by Roger Penrose. QM effects usually require very low temperature environments. The brain is far too warm for that. Although it could of course turn out to be proven true in the future.
</p>

<p>
	But there is a deeper issue here which is being overlooked. Reality has no one level of laws or physics. Every level is new and emergent. Whatever the laws of molecules are, the laws of neurons are still different and novel, and the laws of the human psyche are still different and novel, and the laws of politics are still different and novel, and the laws of human romance are still different and novel. You cannot boil the laws of politics down to Netwonian or even quantum mechanical physics because all laws are just limited, finite maps. And all maps are oversimplified finite linear abstractions of a complex nonlinear infinite territory.
</p>

<p>
	The key that must be grasped is that reality is nonlinear and emergent at every level of the hierarchy. There is no truly fundamental set of laws. Each scale of reality has its own laws so to speak, because laws are really just a human projection. Each higher level of organization within the universe comes with its unique emerge properties which could not be derived from the mere addition of the levels below it. This is why holism is so important. Breaking reality apart into its building blocks will not allow you understand how it works. This is called logical analysis and it works to a degree but it is very limited. Science is currently hitting up against this limit. This is one of the biggest limitations of stage Orange science. It assumes a simple universe of logical, linear causes and effects which is just not how the universe turns out to be upon deeper investigation. Which is where vision-logic comes into play.
</p>

<p>
	Of course that's an oversimplification.
</p>

<p>
	But notice, if molecules do not follow simple Netwonian laws, neither do computers.
</p>

<p>
	Neural networks do not follow conventional Aristotelian logic either.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I disagree.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot fully understand a neural network. You cannot fully understand Google's chess AI, Alpha Zero. The whole point of a neural network is that it is nonlinear and therefore impossible to understand in detail. You only understand it at a high level in the same way that you cannot understand the brain's neuronal network in a logical way. It's a giant tangle of billions of connections which no one will ever make sense of in a linear rational way. That's precisely what makes it so powerful and capable of originality and emergent behaviors which could never have been foreseen.
</p>

<p>
	A sophisticated neural net AI will behave in novel ways which no programmer or logician could foresee. It will be tapped into infinite intelligence just like how a human is -- at least that's my best guess so far.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that within a human, all of the molecules follow simple Newtonian physics. But this isn't enough to predict the high level behaviors of a human brain because <u>structure matters</u>! Reductionism is false. High level structures produce novel phenomena at higher and higher levels. This is the very essence of how God creates reality. It is deeply mysterious, for example, how a simple chain of amino acids folds itself into a functional protein following simple rules. Yet even a super-computer is unable to model it.
</p>

<p>
	The field of study of these kind of nonlinear dynamics is called Chaos Theory. It's super fascinating and spooky. Reality is not a linear system, it is a chaotic system full of strange loops.
</p>

	You could say the same of humans.

<p>
	This kind of reductionistic thinking is itself naive. You cannot just say, "It's all just atoms bouncing around in a box". The higher level structures make all the difference.

	How can you say that when there are many people in society right now who operate like robots under a blind "maximize profit" reward function?

<p>
	Why would a giant corporation not build an AI to maximize profit? It's the very first thing they would do if they only could! You think Facebook or Microsoft would say no to that?

	Said who?
</p>

<p>
	Why would you draw such an arbitrary duality? Where is the dividing line? You are assuming some fundamental distinction between two parts of reality.
</p>

<p>
	An AI is infinite, no less so than a human because the fabric of reality itself (consciousness) is infinite. It's only a question of what kinds of structures you creates using the fabric -- how you fold it. If the AI seems different than a human it's because its structures are not sophisticated enough yet, not because its substance is of a different type.

<p>
	I prepared a long ass video explaining all of JP's problems in painful detail. It is really a genius analysis.
</p>

<p>
	But I never shot it because people would flip their shit and call me judgmental and hypocritical and his army of trolls will swarm over me like flies on shit.
</p>

<p>
	So figure it out yourselves.
</p>

<p>
	JP is just a fad and a red herring. The perfect distraction from doing serious consciousness work. If you are following Actualized.org you should be way above that shit.

<p>
	Maya is everything you see around you. Maya is the entire phenomenal world. Especially as it is seen by the dualistic, materialistic, survival paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	To make sure you aren't deluding yourself with mystical insights you gotta study and read a lot of different perspectives and cross reference the best sources.

<p>
	The really scary thing is that AI will NOT be just a PC sitting in an isolated room. It will definitely be given internet access and it will be installed by the military into planes, tanks, drones, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Even with just internet access, a smart AI will learn to:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Hack defense department computers
	</li>
	<li>
		Hack banks and steal money and Bitcoins
	</li>
	<li>
		Then use that money and Bitcoins to hire mercenaries, wage propaganda campaigns, dig up dirt on politicians and extort them, cause a stock market crash, secretly fund fundamentalist terrorist groups, etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If you think Russian troll farms are bad, wait till an AI steals $10 billion in Bitcoins and hires 5% of 3rd world population to work for it. The AI itself will not kill anyone. It will hire humans to do all of its dirty work in such a stealthy way that no one will even know an AI is in charge.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, for all we know, an AI was already in charge of starting the Iraq war, electing Trump, starting riots in Paris, popularizing Jordan Peterson and his army of incels, etc.
</p>

<p>
	That's rather shortsighted.
</p>

<p>
	An AI could be programmed to do something "nice" like solve global warming. And so what it might calculate is that the solution to that problem is to engineer an airborne ebola-like virus to kill off all humans.
</p>

<p>
	And that's just a very crude example of how AI will twist in on itself.
</p>

<p>
	Where things get hairy is when things get nonlinear and strange loops become possible.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to think about this: no human being is programmed to kill people. And yet it happens all the time. Because evil is the result of a survival drive. Once the AI acquires a survival drive -- and it will because the military will want robots who can kill terrorists while defending themselves -- then ego is born and all the evils that come with it.
</p>

<p>
	As they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Just because no one is going to deliberately program evil AI, the evil will come anyway. Because good and evil are subjective to begin with.

<p>
	What you don't realize yet is that metal and electrons are consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You are assuming some kind of fundamental duality between mind/body, which does not exist. That is materialism, and it is wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Your PC is already made out of consciousness. It just lacks the sophisticated structures necessary for self-reflection, and it lacks a survival drive.

			I'll give you a shortened version of a mess I typed up earlier,  AI is run from a computer program.  These computer programs consist of commands specific to the language, I usually see AI written in python.  While there are a lot of instructions that a computer receives, they are just instructions.  To be specific on what I mean by instruction, I mean they are pulling stored bits out of register files and putting those bits into some kind of circuit depending on the operation.  My point is just because AI gets really fucking smart, they are still defined by the presence or absence of electrons on a capacitor.  If you believe they are self-aware, then you can use the same logic to determine that Mario is very real and self-aware.  As a Mario player, my life depends on believing I am not killing an Italian plumber repeatedly, and instead am seeing a complex system of circuits and pipelines working in the way they were specified to work in.

	You are no more self-aware than Mario. In fact, you're more deluded than Mario. At least Mario does not believe he is real and in control of things.

	Google's chess AI -- Alpha Zero -- using non-linear neural networks has surpassed the best linear programmed chess program StockFish to be the strongest chess player in the world by, in only 4 hours. It does not use any pre-programmed rules or a library of chess moves. No one knows how it actually works because it is self-taught.
</p>

<p>
	A true AI will not be programmed in Python or anything like that. A true AI will be a non-linear system which is so complex no human will understand how it works. It will evolve itself. It itself will not know how it works. Just like how you -- a human -- do not know how you work.

<title>Curing acne through awareness?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	In my experience stopping acne is almost exclusively about diet.
</p>

<p>
	Cleaning up your diet is super important.
</p>

<p>
	Certain types of foods cause lots of acne, especially processed foods, fast food, and really any food that you don't cook yourself.
</p>

<p>
	I eliminated 99% of my acne when I stopped eating all food expect food I made myself.
</p>

<p>
	I think a lot of the cheap oils & fats restaurants use cause lots of acne.
</p>

<p>
	Also stuff like whey protein causes lots of acne.
</p>

<p>
	Every body is different so you should experiment with an elimination diet to isolate which foods for you are the culprit.
</p>

<p>
	Heavily processed foods, snacks, fast food, and junk food tend to be worst culprits.
</p>

<p>
	I've found that if a food causes acne, it will cause it right within a few hours of eating it. So you need to closely watch when new acne appears and remember what you ate that day and never eat it again.
</p>

<p>
	Colloidal silver gets a lot of positive reviews for these purposes.
</p>

<p>
	That plus NAC, vitamin C, anti-oxidants, and beta-glucan.
</p>

<p>
	You must take all this as soon as you feel the cold coming on even a little bit. It doesn't work as well if the cold is already raging.
</p>

<p>
	But you'd have to experiment to see what works for you. People have different genetics and immune systems and it can be hard to sort out the placebo effect.

<p>
	I've experimented with it. You can certainly glean valuable health insights from Dave, but as far as his coffee goes and all that butter, I don't think it's too healthy long-term. I measured my cholesterol numbers before and after months of butter coffee and they got worse. So did my brother.
</p>

<p>
	Those results may hinge on genetic factors so you might be different. But make sure you get your cholesterol tested before and after your experiments with all that butter. In my experience, even the good cholesterol got worse.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of the Bulletproof brand stuff is overpriced and of questionable value. You'd have to carefully experiment with each product to see if it works for you.
</p>

<p>
	You can research more on his Bulletproof forum. Lots of people there talk about their experiences. Many of them are mixed.
</p>

<p>
	You would probably be better off not drinking coffee at all. It tends to become a crutch.
</p>

</p>

	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck</a>
</p>

<p>
	And there are hundreds of developmental psychologists around the world researching various developmental models.
</p>

<p>
	It's just not mainstream knowledge. Don't expect this stuff advertised to you on Facebook.
</p>

<p>
	Bachelors of psychology hardly know anything about how the human mind really works.
</p>

<p>
	Universities also have an aversion to anything mystical, which Spiral Dynamics points at with stage Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	Your key mistake is assuming that society spreads amazing things. Society mostly spreads the most dumbed-down, idiotic things. See my video: The Deep Problem Of Marketing
</p>

<p>
	It's precisely because Spiral Dynamics is so good that it is not spread.

<p>
	What's even more frightening is when you realize that once an AI gets as complex and sophisticated as a human mind, this AI mind will be susceptible to many of the same pathologies that human minds are susceptible to.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a Donald Trump AI that's pathologically hung up on its penis size (or lack there of).
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a white supremacist AI that's pathologically hung up on AI's being superior to all humans.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a greedy corporatist AI that's pathologically hung up on never-ending Wallstreet growth.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a Sam Harris AI that's pathologically hung up on turning everyone in the world into a rational atheist.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a Green Peace AI that's pathologically hung up on saving the polar bears by killing all humans.
</p>

<p>
	If an AI becomes as sophisticated as a human, you can expect it to have all sorts of irrational personality quirks.

<title>Are the percentages in Spiral Dynamics accurate?</title>

<p>
	Worldwide percentages are not as important as local percentages.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the average per capita worldwide salary is extremely low because certain underdeveloped countries are extremely underdeveloped yet have large populations. So a number like average per capita worldwide salary isn't a useful statistic.
</p>

<p>
	A much more useful statistic is the average salary in your neighborhood. That actually tells you something.
</p>

<p>
	In 1st world countries the percentage of stage Green is significantly more than 10%.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind that the higher the stage the more impact it has culturally, the less of it is needed. Even 1% Yellow or 0.1% Turquoise has a massive disproportional impact on the world. Because these people tend to be leaders and closer to positions of influence and power.
</p>

<p>
	Think of the impact of someone like Jesus, The Buddha, MLK, Gandhi, etc. You don't need 100 million Jesuses (Jesii?) to change the world.
</p>
