<p>
	Science is a conceptual, symbolic, relativistic, and dualistic enterprise. It cannot overcome this ever because all language is dualistic amd science cannot be done without language. Try it.
</p>

<p>
	Beyond language is mysticism.

It is an abstract point about frames of reference.
</p>

<p>
	"Bad" only exists relative to some frame of reference you establish. How else can you determine when to call a thing bad? You need some criteria. Whatever criteria you choose will be aribtrary. You might say death is bad. But that's only true assuming you don't want to die. If you want to die death now becomes good. You might say, but who wanta to die? That is irrelevant. The point has already been made. It is an abstract point.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be bad as an Absolute.

<p>
	The epistemology and metaphysics of science is a very complex topic. There is no silver bullet against science. The devil is all in the details. Many books could and have be written about it.
</p>

<p>
	The core problem is that science does not question its own foundations.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know science is capable of accessing Absolute Truth? After all, this has never been demonstrated by science. And how would you demonstrate it anyway? By using science? Do you see how that begs the question? If science is incomplete or flawed then you cannot use science to validated science. You need a meta science. And a meta meta science, and so on to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Science actually has no foundation because reality is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	The ancient Greek skeptics showed 2000 years ago why no human knowledge is possible. But the scientists ignored them. And they are in denial about it to this day.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot convince a scientist that science is a dream. Because scientists hold science as a dogma. Like religious people. You will never convince a Muslim that his idea of Allah is a dream. Because his mind is not open to such a possibility. He is not interested in searching for Truth because he thinks he's already found it. 
</p>

<p>
	I think you missed the point. I didn't exactly say people like suffering. I was just making a point about frames of reference.
</p>

<p>
	Torturing a puppy is only bad relative to the assumption that suffering is bad.
</p>

<p>
	From the Absolute perspective, suffering is not bad.

<p>
	We have a few new Mods who came online recently and they are still learning the ropes. Being a Mod is not easy, it requires a light touch, and I am working with our new Mods to make sure they understand this.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes they may step over the line because there are no clear lines within reality. This is the nature of the game. But overall I think we'll be good.
</p>

<p>
	Policing people is never easy because they take it so personally. No one ever wants to admit they are in the wrong because from their POV they never are. Relativity 101.

<p>
	Existentially we are all equal. But this is pickup/dating. Within the dating game you gotta build up confidence.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel like you're inferior and less cool than others, the girl will smell it off you like stink off a squashed skunk.
</p>

<p>
	You have to feel entitled to the girl. You will only be able to attract and maintain girls who you feel entitled to. As soon as you start to feel, "Oh man, I'd be so lucky to have this girl", you've already lost her.
</p>

<p>
	Your attitude must be: "This girl would be lucky to sleep with me because I'm such an awesome person." And then make that true. Turn yourself into an awesome person. This isn't just about BS-ing yourself or her. Your confidence must be grounded in the fact that you truly love yourself and recognize your own awesomeness.
</p>

<p>
	It all boils down to building a high self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
	How could you not be awesome? You are God after all! LOL. So start acting like it.

	Sit down and get it. This isn't so hard.

	No one will ever supply you with proof that you are God. You must recognize it.

	But are you conscious of what God is? It's one thing to realize you are God, but another thing to realize what God is.

<p>
	It cannot be easily formalized. Low quality is a nebulous thing. When I see it, I will moderate it.
</p>

<p>
	The Mods are mostly enforcing standard forum guidelines.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of locking low quality threads is reduce distraction. It's all too easy for people to come here and become keyboard jockeys, wasting their own time and those of the Mods, myself, and all of you guys. No serious spiritual school would allow such distractions. This forum needs to maintain a certain focus and quality level.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise I would rather just shut the whole thing down.

	We lock very few threads. This forum will moderate low quality posts and posters.
</p>

<p>
	You don't appreciate how bad this place would be without moderation.

<p>
	This place is not 4chan, where you get to post any random nonsense. If you want that, go to 4chan. Experience what that is like.

<p>
	That's the beauty of it: you are free to do whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	It's called liberation for a reason.
</p>

<p>
	There are no shoulds in life. All shoulds are relative.
</p>

<p>
	But don't forget, all actions have consequences. So you are not free from the consequences of your choices.

<p>
	There is nothing but direct experience, so you have no other other but to trust it.
</p>

<p>
	Name one thing which isn't in your direct experience? You cannot.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is how you are misinterpreting your experience with egoic distortions.

</p>

<p>
	Of course ego also cares a lot about physical survival. Your physical, social, and psychological survival are all intertwined.
</p>

<p>
	Intuition and even the higher self are often also part of survival.
</p>

<p>
	Try to locate what isn't survival in your experience. Most things will be survival.

<p>
	A few good options here:
</p>

<p>
	1) "My friends are around here somewhere." [point into a large crowd], or "I'm waiting for them to show up" or "They just left. They were tired."
</p>

<p>
	2) Just own it and admit you're out alone. "I was bored at home and I felt like going out, so here I am." or "That's how I roll girl. I'm not part of some gaggle of sheep."
</p>

<p>
	3) Just ignore and change the conversation into something else, "You seem like the kind of girl who voted for Trump. Admit it! You voted for Trump, didn't you?!" or "Why are you being so racist?"
</p>

<p>
	They lose interest because you don't own your aloneness. If you think it's weird, she will think its weird. If you think its totally normal to be out at a club alone, she won't care either. But you have to keep the conversation moving. Don't just say you're alone and then let it hang. You gotta immediately follow up with some other conversation topic as if her question was nothing at all.
</p>

<p>
	In general what you're lacking here is confidence. A confident man does not let some random girl judge him or frame control him. You gotta feel that you are way cooler than her no matter how many sheepish friends are around her. Her sheep friends are all fools and so is she for herding up with them. Be the badass lone wolf. And treat everyone in the club as your friends. You can make instant friends with some random guys in the club.
</p>

<p>
	When you are in the club you gotta walk around like you are the owner of the place. Exude that kind of confidence and comfort.
</p>

You are actually acting without egoic calculations in the moment. You are not thinking. In fact there isn't even a self in the moment. Which is why it feels so good. But these moment are rare because mostly you're thinking and calculating so much.
</p>

<p>
	Think of a moment when you are laughing hard with friends. In that moment the ego is absent. In that moment your personality shines the most.

That's what ego is mostly doing: surviving the complex social persona of you. And it's doing it perfectly. All of your thoughts are about that.

<p>
	That's exactly what I'm saying.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of a symbol is such that for it to serve as a symbol is its being must be overlooked. If a symbol's being is recognized, then it stop being a symbol and becomes being/Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The word cat is not itself a cat. Because of this, the Truth cannot be symbolized. Truth is prior to symbols. Truth cannot be pointed at because any pointer is already itself the Truth, but not recognized to be so.

<p>
	I am also in your subjective experience. So how could you think I'm real?
</p>

<p>
	Why the double standard?

But your body would still have preferences. It has instinctive programming to avoid stuff which endangers survival. So in practice you will survive just fine because your body has an intelligence of its own and it's not going to do something as stupid as sawing your own leg off. But at the same time, you will be at peace with the prospect of the body dying. You can survive without being attached to survival.
</p>

<p>
	What happens to the body become irrelevant when you're conscious enough because you're so conscious you know that you're not limited to the body. The body is like clothing you are wearing. The body is God's jacket.

<p>
	It's actually more radical than that. You can achieve a state of consciousness so total that you realize you always ARE doing precisely what you want. So if someone is sawing your leg off, you can be conscious that you (as God) are doing that to yourself. Because EVERYTHING that happens is God's Will and it is all Absolutely Good and done out of pure Love. It is a love that you as a human cannot fathom or embody because it is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	When you are that conscious, there is no need to exert your own personal human will. Whatever happens, however it happens, becomes fine by you because you realize THAT is your will.
</p>

<p>
	By defintion, anything that happens is your will. Not your human will, but your God's Will.
</p>

<p>
	Your personal will must be surrendered completely so that whatever the universe does becomes your will.
</p>

<p>
	There are many levels to imagination. Some imagination is very surface level, like when you imagine the Earth is flat. Some imagination is very deep, like when you imagine that you were born or that your parents are real.
</p>

<p>
	Most of your imagination is outside your personal human will, therefore you call it "physical reality" or "other". What you mean here is that it's other to you as an ego self. But as God you have locked your out from your own full power so that you could create this limit human form. Sort of like how a computer OS can lock out applications from accessing all of a computer's internals, for security purposes.
</p>

<p>
	You are not currently in a state of consciousness which gives you access to your own deepest levels of imagination. You only have access to the "human" levels right now. Until you change your state.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like you're world class genius who uses his genius to act like a retarded person. Your act is so convincing that you actually think you're retarded when in fact you are a genius with an infinite IQ.

	If you have not taken 5-MeO, then don't speak about 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	It's that simple. Not too much to ask.

</p>

<p>
	It became quickly obvious to me when I was about 21 years old that a university would not accept my radical epistemology because it would be the death of the university.
</p>

<p>
	Creating new paths is what I enjoy. I have little interest in walking other people's paths.

<p>
	Language only works for sharing common experiences. You cannot communicate something which another person has never experienced. So what we need to get more people having more mystical experiences easily.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why psychedelics are the best way of creating a common spiritual language. But of course they are demonized precisely for this reason.

<p>
	I mostly just release the videos which I feel motivated to release. I don't calculate too much about it. But of course, that's because I have that luxury. If you're just starting off you have to be much more calculating. In my early days I released a lot of videos which were not my favorite topics but which I knew would be popular mainstream topics.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, of course all others ultimately equals self. But when you run into a grizzly bear in the woods you don't say to yourself, "No big deal. That's just myself."
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with mixing relative and absolute domains.
</p>

<p>
	If aliens exist, that's still significant to human life, even though we are all of course one.
</p>

<p>
	To call an alien an ego projection is as silly as calling a grizzly bear an ego projection. Aliens can have valuable lessons to share. And they are worthwhile in their own right, simply by virtue of being aliens. If aliens are real, communing with them is a worthwhile activity. As worthwhile as any other activity.

<p>
	It does change you for sure, but in subtle ways.
</p>

<p>
	Mostly what I have gained in not equanimity but understanding, humility, love, God, authenticity, wonder, and overcoming the fear of death. The body is more at ease too.
</p>

<p>
	But I still have much work to do on myself. My equanimity is not great and I still have plenty of cravings.
</p>

<p>
	Without 5-MeO I would not have the understanding of God's mechanics as I do. To me that was the most delicious and important thing. I care more about understanding God than I do about anything else. And so for me my deepest desire was fulfilled with total omniscience.

</p>

<p>
	When you become fully conscious you'll realize brains are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Animals are also something you are hallucinating.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a video game character has a brain does not mean the brain is running the simulation. The brain is part of the simulation.

	It's not bad, but it will simply never work because you are assuming reality is a static objective thing when it fact the very language you use constructs reality and no two people live in the same reality.

<p>
	Yes, it's all God's imagination. But you are God, so it's your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	It's not all "ego stuff" any more than you seeing a cat walking down the street is "ego stuff". That's not ego, it's the "world".
</p>

<p>
	Some people who trip can of course do so in a dualistic way, where they might see an alien and assume that this alien is somehow "other" to them. But that alien is just like any other being in "real life". It is BOTH an entity other than you, but also it is you, since all people are you.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at the world dualistically, other people are not you.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at the world nondualistically, other people are all your own projections.
</p>

<p>
	There's really no contradiction. Both are true in a sense.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you trip with a weak spiritual foundation the ego can co-opt the trips and do a lot of egoic stuff and projecting. So you have to be careful about self-deception. Just like you do in "real life."
</p>

<p>
	But seeing a DMT entity is not ego any more than seeing a cat is.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course, this is a key issue which so many people get wrong. Most people are unconsciously acting out either an individualist dogma or a collectivist dogma without realizing that these are two mutually-interdependent forces which must be carefully balanced. See video: Aztec Nonduality, where I discuss the central importance of balance.
</p>

<p>
	A big part of conscious politics is recognizing that delicate balances must be struck between capitalism & socialism, individualism vs collectivism, freedom & limitation, and status quo & progress. None of these can be taken as absolute goods. Any philosophy or ideology which takes an absolutist position on any one of these is misguided, Tier 1, and will ultimately fail. Yin and yang must be balanced. But not necessarily down the middle. Balance is a complex and dynamic process, not the mid-point between any two positions.

<p>
	I also stress that difference.
</p>

<p>
	And I also stress the difference between awakening and things like cognitive development, moral development, and other developmental lines.
</p>

<p>
	You can be deeply enlightened but still deficient in cognitive development and other important things.
</p>

<p>
	Post-awakening pathologies are very common. An entire book could be written about them.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I really dislike defining "enlightenment" as total perfection. Once people get that definition in their heads, they start to expect perfection from their fave nondual teachers and then get shocked when they see their fave teacher/guru fall short of that standard because that standard is virtually impossible to meet even after 40 years of practice.
</p>

<p>
	Even when Christ was nailed to the cross he said, "Father, why have you forsaken me?" This was a very human response to a horrific situation. And I'm sure he suffered deeply.
</p>

<p>
	So to set up a standard for students that even Christ could not meet is not wise.
</p>

<p>
	And of course 5-MeO-DMT will never give anyone such an extraordinary degree of perfect equanimity permanently. Although during a 5-MeO-DMT peak, I have had that degree of perfect equanimity, where pain and pleasure are literally indistinguishable. But it will not last.

<p>
	One of the upsides of Bernie is that he has 40 years of government/politics experience. A lot of newer Democrats in this primary have some good ideas, but they are just inexperienced with how Washington really works. That's important to take into account. That's one of Yang's downsides for example. Same with Williamson. I worry such people might be somewhat naive about the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
	I would like to see a special law passed which seriously protects and even actively encourages whistler-blowers to come forward. It's gross how whistler-blowers are attacked for revealing deep truths. That's pure devilry. Whistler-blowers must be celebrated as heroes.

	Of course. I don't see people confusing those two.

	Someone who has a few awakenings is not a master. But also this should not be used to disparage or deny their awakenings -- which are genuine and important, although incomplete.

<p>
	No one is claiming this either. Self-deception is always at work. Perfect clarity is not how this work works. We are doing the best we can under conditions of limited knowledge and various biases.
</p>

<p>
	The issue I have with your advancing of "enlightenment" is that you're stuck on this notion of mastery or total enlightenment as you've chosen to define it, and dismissing anything shy of it.
</p>

<p>
	Virtually no one here is going to become a master, so talking about total enlightenment is basically pointless here. It's so exceptionally rare that it is irrelevant. If someone is serious about becoming a master, they ain't on this forum, they are in a cave or forest meditating full time and they don't need any outside guidance. They understand how to do the work.

<p>
	Dude, chill. By shamanic work I was simply referring to Martin's sessions where he guided clients.
</p>

<p>
	You get really hung up on technicalities without seeing the bigger picture of the conversation.
</p>

<p>
	What Martin was doing is just a variation of shamans offering medicine. Call it what you will.
</p>

<p>
	I have read his books, I'm just not hanging on his every word as you seem to be. I read his books and quickly moved on to greater things. I am not interested in following his books as a step by step instruction manual. Precisely because I have other perspectives to consider and I saw problems with some of his methodology, including the dismissal of insight and intellectual integration of trips. I was also not interested in energetically overloading myself. I asked him about the possibility of energetic overload in an email a long time ago. He said it wasn't a problem at all. And I decided for myself that I don't believe that. It is a legit problem from my POV. And I take that into account whenever I trip and with how I suggest others trips. Because it's pretty obvious to me that disregarding energetic overload can be dangerous and reckless for other people if not for oneself. Which is why I developed the plugging method.
</p>

<p>
	I don't blindly follow people, I learn from them and adapt it to suit myself. I recommend you do the same, otherwise you might end up following someone off a cliff.

</p>

<p>
	I can remember some of my earliest trips as though they happened yesterday. The memories can be very vivid and even emotional, inspiring, and awakening.
</p>

<p>
	When I go over some of my deepest trips in my memory, it actually shifts my consciousness up a few notches in the now.
</p>

<p>
	Insights are also not just a matter of memory. Deep insights change your whole worldview and recontextualize life.
</p>

<p>
	I can never just forget that I am God. That understanding is with me no matter how bad I might feel.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like school. You don't need to remember all the details and facts in order for school to have significantly shaped your life. The trips reshape you even if you can't fully recall them.
</p>

<p>
	I have never claimed that 5-MeO will clear you of all defilements or produce mastery. My claim was much more humble: that it produces genuine and very deep awakening experiences which are helpful and healing.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to purify all defilements that will obviously require far more work and it is not likely to happen through psychedelic use alone, although psychedelics ARE very effective at curing certain defilements. But probably not all of them.
</p>

<p>
	To cure all defilements would require lots of daily, near minute to minute practice. It could not be a peak experience. There is value to peak experiences as well as more gradual and mundane daily work.
</p>

<p>
	All of this was quite clear from day one. I don't know why anyone would assume that 5-MeO would do all that work for you. That was never it's purpose. It is not a replacement for inner work, it is a catalyst. Which I have said from my first videos on psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with setting the wrong expectations.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not the same as moral perfection or being Christ-like. Awakening is literally just this: becoming conscious of the true nature of ultimate reality. It is not behavioral reform. If you still crave smoking, that's a separate issue.
</p>

<p>
	Many of you guys are talking about mastery, which is something that will take you a lifetime of work.
</p>

<p>
	It is foolish to equate enlightenment with mastery. And no one has ever said that Martin had mastery. This was quite obvious.
</p>

<p>
	Buddhist maps are also poor at taking into account psychedelics. The psychedelic path requires drawing new maps. Actually what psychedics reveal is the inadequecy and partiality of Buddhist maps. The Ten Ox Herding Pics do not work well for psychedelics.
</p>

			Yes. Energy is no joke and I haven't even done 5-meo-dmt. Awhile ago you mentioned you felt electricity entering your fingertips. I had this happen to me on an aya ceremony. I literally could not make a fist and my hands were raised to the sky. Just trying to surrender completely. It was the first time I KNEW divinity was real.

<p>
	That was on an early highest dosed snorted trip: 30mg. It was truamatic and felt unhealthy so I dialed my doses back a lot and invented the plugging method, which is much smoother.
</p>

<p>
	I have not felt unhealthy energetic overload from plugging about 30 moderate doses. The trips were still very strong, but smooth and healthy feeling.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It doesn't necessarily gain any ability. Any siddhis gained are an independent factor.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening alone does not clear up all energetic issues, or shadow, or ego, or emotional issues, or bad habits. Nor is it development. So there are many factors herw besides awakening.
</p>

<p>
	All of this I have stressed in the past.
</p>

<p>
	Many awakened teachers have weird personality flaws and shadow issues and pathologies.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening does not mean there cannot be a pathology. As history shows.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The rules must be very different for all 3.
</p>

<p>
	Gigantic biz needs the most oversight because of how much damage they can do if allowed to roam free.

<p>
	To be clear, Martin's method of using 5-MeO is very different from mine.
</p>

<p>
	I don't endorse blasting oneself with 5-MeO to the point of energetic overload as that can be needlessly traumatic.
</p>

<p>
	Moderate dosing is important in my book.
</p>

Not as many as you mention above.
</p>

<p>
	Then he started being a shaman. Which is what he describes in that vid above. And yeah, I stand corrected, seems like he did a lot of it at that point as part of his shaman gig.
</p>

<p>
	So he did much more than me then in total.
</p>

<p>
	I did not realize he was smoking it in every shaman session.
</p>

<p>
	Also, taking on other people's bad energy could be very problematic if that's what his shamanism involved.
</p>

<p>
	It costs the IRS zero to know your income. You report it to them! If you report over $200k, no UBI for you the next year. If your income drops below $200k/yr a few years later, then you start getting it again. So you always have a safety net but you don't need to use it when you are kicking ass.
</p>

<p>
	The actual dollar limits aren't so important. Those can be tweaked to find a good sweet spot.
</p>

<p>
	Very profitable corporations like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Walmart should be taxed significantly more. They are getting away with robbery.
</p>

<p>
	Small biz should be taxed less. Anything under $1M should have low tax so more people are starting small businesses. In fact there should be government rewards for starting a small biz.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that people do not need more than a few mil to live extremely well. Anything beyond that is actually unhealthy for society and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different ways to do psychedelics. They don't have to burn out anything. There are gentle ways of doing them.
</p>

<p>
	And to say that psychedelics only give insights is just false and shows a lack of experience with using them.
</p>

<p>
	Martin did not even do a lot of 5-MeO. I've done more trips than him at this point.
</p>

<p>
	I was watching an interview with a guy who did 600 DMT trips. Now that's a lot of trips.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do a fair comparison, let's bring up all the cases of people who became depressed, suicidal, had insomnia, or got attacked by demons from intense meditation or yoga. 1000s of such cases are easily found.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual work is messy, period. Do not single out psychedelics here as if all other paths are a cake walk and free of problems.
</p>

<p>
	We just don't know what is going on with Martin. We need to wait and see how things go for him.
</p>

<p>
	If Martin finally concludes that psychedelics caused his insomnia, then that will be an importnat point to acknowledge and take into account. Although even in that case, it's still just one case.
</p>

<p>
	How do you pay for UBI? Easy:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Wealth tax on people with net worth over $10M
	</li>
	<li>
		Raise taxes on people with income over $1M/year
	</li>
	<li>
		Raise capital gains tax
	</li>
	<li>
		Raise taxes on passive income
	</li>
	<li>
		Wall Street tax
	</li>
	<li>
		Real estate speculation tax
	</li>
	<li>
		Much higher taxes on real estate that is a 2nd or 3rd home.
	</li>
	<li>
		Raise taxes on corporations with cash reserves over $1 billion
	</li>
	<li>
		High taxes on yatchs and private jets and luxury cars
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	No VAT, and people who earn over $200k/yr do not get a UBI at all since they don't need it.
</p>

<p>
	Nay if it involves VAT taxes, cutting welfare programs, and eating into welfare benefits.
</p>

<p>
	Nay if it means no free college, no Medicare For All, no $15 minimum wage.
</p>

<p>
	Yea if it is done properly taking all the above into account.
