	You could also create an identity out of having a certain length of hair, or any other attribute.
</p>

<p>
	How about when a child is born is call ones with curly hair "aliens" and ones with straight hair "queens"? And then we program our entire culture around this, such that we have separate bathrooms for aliens and queens, and we dress and treat them differently. We pay the aliens half as much as the queens. We humiliate aliens in public. We tell the aliens that they are worse than queens and then they will want to kill themselves.

<p>
	Obviously it does not. It proves there is a disappearance and reappearance.
</p>

<p>
	The claim is not that something disappears when you close your eyes.
</p>

<p>
	The claim is that it disappears and reappears precisely however many times you close and open your eyes.
</p>

<p>
	You are being dumb in how you're thinking about this whole thing. Stop trying to simplify reality. Reality is precisely how it appears. In your lifetime, the moon will appear and disappear something like 10,000 times. That is exactly what's true. Not that there is one moon. There are 10,000 different moons. And if you live a little longer, there will a few more moons. And if you die tomorrow, they will be a lot less.
</p>

<p>
	Reality dynamically adjusts to create the present moment however it is, exactly as it is. Obviously! Any simplification you make of it will be wrong.
</p>

	You will build many nests before your build the right one.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are not thinking about this layering problem carefully enough.
</p>

<p>
	If you have 2 layers, the second layer would still have to be held in consciousness. No matter how many layers you imagine, they would all still have to be held by consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And furthermore you're missing the beingness of the appearance layer. You cannot remove the truth/beingness of appearance by citing some other layer or thing, because appearance IS absolute truth.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is that you think you can somehow ignore the truth of appearances, but you cannot, because anything that appears must be absolutely true.
</p>

<p>
	This does not make sense to you because you are not conscious of what Absolute & Truth are. You have confused these things for concepts. But Truth is not a concept.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to understand what I'm saying is after awakening.

<p>
	You need this:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.walkinlab.com/products/view/dd-toxic-metals-urine-test-kit-doctor-s-data" rel="external nofollow">https://www.walkinlab.com/products/view/dd-toxic-metals-urine-test-kit-doctor-s-data</a>
</p>

<p>
	And you must buy DMSA on your own for the test. The test kit will not include DMSA nor will it tell you how much to dose. You have to figure that out yourself.
</p>

<p>
	DMSA is not sold in the USA. You have to order it from overseas.

<p>
	I can't speak to the Course's material, all I can say is that I don't consider Jeffery Martin awake, nor does he understand what awakening truly is, from my POV.
</p>

<p>
	You will get more awakening in one dose of psychedelic than any such course.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever awakening this course offers, it will be very, very weak.

<p>
	No, that's all too much work.

<p>
	He will get rich from riling up and milking his Trumpist base. He's gonna keep doing those stupid rallies until he's either dead or in jail.

<p>
	That's what it means to say reality is imaginary. Whatever you imagine becomes real. But not the ego-you, the God-you. This why insane people live in a very real world of their insanity. To them, it's fully real.
</p>

<p>
	To a Christian, Jesus is literally the one and only son of God.
</p>

<p>
	To a QAnnoner, Hilary Clinton really is a pedophile and Trump is going to save the world.
</p>

<p>
	To a Nazi, Jews and brown people are a disgusting plague of diseased locust.
</p>

<p>
	To a radical Islamist, America is literally Satan.
</p>

<p>
	Until they stop imagining that.

<p>
	A big juicy multi-part video series on the limits of science is coming soon. This will be a serious deconstruction of all of science.
</p>

<p>
	I wanted to collect any questions people have about science, how it works, what it's limits are, any objections to my critiques of science, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I'm particularly interested in collecting any counter-critiques of my critiques of science. Tell me any way you think I'm wrong about science. Obviously you'd have to see my videos first to have counter-critiques, but maybe you have some based on my older videos.
</p>

<p>
	Ask away. Your question may be addressed in the Objections section of the series.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	We do that with each stage, so it's fair game. There do exist some extreme examples of Green, just like with any stage below it.

<p>
	Some Green folk are nuts.
</p>

<p>
	When left-wingers go too far into their upotian socialist ideals, they lose touch with the pragmatics of survival.
</p>

<p>
	Ideas such as abolishing the police, military, and open borders will never work within our lifetimes. Although they are great ideas for later on, let's say in 500 years when the whole world has a higher standard of living where everyone is able to shop at Wholefoods.

<p>
	Imagination means it is a mental activity.
</p>

<p>
	The physical world is the mental activity of an Infinite Mind.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you can become conscious of how you are imagining your own hands or your parents or your childhood.
</p>

<p>
	My entire body is imaginary. Made up of figments of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You will readily admit that dreams are imaginary, right? Like, your body inside a dream is imaginary, right? Obviously. Well, now just go one step further and apply that to the physical world. It is just a bit more of a powerful form of imagination.

<p>
	In a sense it is not. It is a limited state of God's mind. God's mind can expand infinitely beyond your little bubble. But assuming it isn't expanded. This is what it is.
</p>

<p>
	You see, when God's mind is limited, that's literally what God becomes until it changes to something more unlimited.
</p>

<p>
	So, in a sense, God is able to lock itself out of its own mind. When God imagines it is a human, it's as if God doesn't exist. From the human's POV that's the case. And since the human's POV is just God limiting itself, that limited POV becomes reality. Until it changes to something more expansive.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is nothing but POV. So being stuck in the human POV is like the death of God. And taking on the God POV kills the human.

<p>
	That's a bad example because that's a dream within a dream.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening will reveal that to be an illusion.

<p>
	Why would God deny anything??
</p>

<p>
	God will even allow you to deny God, Truth, Consciousness, and Love.
</p>

<p>
	The highest Love is to allow the denial of Love.

	Since God is infinite, it needs no cause, process, or how. It's infinite. It can just pull whatever it wants out of its own ass. That's the whole point of infinity. It makes the impossible possible.

<p>
	Look, reality is completely relativistic.
</p>

<p>
	So if right now your state of consciousness is such that you think there are no other higher states of consciousness, then that is literally what is true. Until you imagine otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	Or consider this:
</p>

<p>
	For an atheist, there actually is no God. Until he imagines otherwise.

<p>
	I take many measures to make sure my work never becomes a cult. But you don't understand that so you see it as a cult.

<p>
	Ironically, this post is gaslighting.
</p>

<p>
	There is no cult here other than the cult you wish to see.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, question your self. What else do you expect a spiritual teacher to say?
</p>

<p>
	This work has nothing to do with me. What Leo says or does is completely irrelevant. Stop making it about me. Simple. Do the work and make progress.

<p>
	That's also imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	All that data is here, so to speak, and it needs no cause.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine data behind the scenes because you are unwilling to accept that the present moment is uncaused and absolute. If you deny uncausality, then you must forever go about hunting for and imagining hidden causes.

<p>
	I am suggesting that basically all awakened teachers are still in limited states of consciousness which maintain their mind's structure for the purposes of survival.
</p>

<p>
	You don't fully appreciate what consciousness is unless you've been in state where you cannot even remember your name. All memory is obviously a limitation of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I've been in states where I can access the memories of every being in the universe. Since memory is just imagination. You are not really remembering your name, you are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	To function in this material plane you must be limited.

	You'll have to spend decades breaking down that character. Awakening will not do that for you. Structure of the mind remain even after awakening, otherwise you'd be dead.

<p>
	They aren't the only way.
</p>

<p>
	But for most people, they will never access awakening otherwise. Psychedelics will save the average person decades of tail-chasing and listening to the empty words of gurus.

</p>

<p>
	Even if you experience all the other bubbles, they will still be inside your bubble and imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to confuse your currented limited state of consciousness for the limits of consciousness itself.
</p>

<p>
	This is where smoking some DMT would be helpful.

<p>
	Locking something in is completely irrelevant to truth.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is the point. Truth is the case regardless of how long it lasts. 3 seconds or a life time. Even when you "lock it in", that is still not permanent, since the body/mind will die and you will cycle back into unenlightenment.

</p>

<p>
	If so, where is it found?

			Well as I said there is two ways of looking at it.. Relatively speaking if we agree there is a knower and a known.. There is knowledge through the senses..and through logical facilities .

<p>
	There are more problems than that. Don't forget the body's health.
</p>

<p>
	Stop framing this as a mutually exclusive thing. You must do both. And don't do psychedelics daily. I only did them daily for specific experiments. I would never make that a chronic habit. That would go against core principles of personal development.

</p>

<p>
	The problem here is that you're taking knowledge for granted. You've never bothered to wonder how knowledge is possible at all and what makes it tick.
</p>

<p>
	Spend a few years contemplating that.

<p>
	Because it becomes a crutch and you need to rewire your brain thru manual effort to go far in this work.

<p>
	Building concentration ability is crucial for this work. You cannot succeed in this work without it. And psychedelics will not build your concentration ability. You need to reach a point where you can enter samadhi through sober concentration.

<p>
	And that is a huge problem.

<p>
	There is a lot more to this work than enlightenment alone. And there is no such thing as one singular enlightenment. There are many grades and qualities of it. Low grades are easy to attain. High grades are extremely rare.

<p>
	Of course. Because virtually nobody is genuinely interested in pursuing truth. Most people pursue spirituality because it makes them feel good, which is still function of ego/survival. People are not seriously interested in deconstructing themselves and reality. Those folks who get sucked into yoga or a Sadhguru program are doing it out of conformity, not any serious desire for truth. Nobody following Sadhguru is interested in truth. They watch his videos like a monkey who has discovered a shiny peddle.

<p>
	Ha! People are 99% deluded before spirituality and then they become 97% deluded after practicing spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Even deeply enlightened people can still be highly deluded. As I keep saying, none of this stuff is a binary switch. There are many, many degrees and dimensions to spiritual work. Just because someone does some spiritual practices or studies some spiritual material does not mean jack. You should still treat them as though they are deeply deluded.
</p>

<p>
	I find that most spiritual people do not take epistemic issues seriously. They couldn't even tell you what epistemology is. Go ask on of Sadhguru's followers about epistemology. You will see they are clueless.
</p>

<p>
	The kind of things I talk about are not talked about in most spiritual schools. It is not all the same, as it might seem. Just because someone uses words like "love", "God", "spirituality", "meditation", "consciousness", "awakening", etc. does not mean they are on the same level. These binary words obscure a lot of depth.
</p>

<p>
	Never, ever trust that some spiritual person is fully awake. I don't care how many decades of experience he has.
</p>

Ik you’ve talked about healthy skepticism but can you briefly tell me the difference between being skeptical and being cynical? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Don't lose sight of the point.
</p>

<p>
	The point of skepticism is not an end in itself but a means to arrive at truth. What we really care about is truth. Do you have a pure, genuine desire for truth? If you do, then you will be loyal to that end, not to skepticism. Skepticism is only valuable in so far as it is helping you in your mission to reach truth. If skepticism stops serving that function, then you must discard it.
</p>

<p>
	For example, how do you know that your use of skepticism isn't a self-deception? Why do you assume skepticism will lead you to truth? How can you be sure you're apply skepticism properly?
</p>

<p>
	Ground yourself in a pure, genuine desire for truth, and the rest will fix itself.
</p>

You must find ways to get the same effect naturally. Otherwise you will always be a slave to that chemical.

	A lot of spiritual people are not truly thinking for themselves or contemplating reality, they are just blindly following a new, higher kind of religion/ideology, which easily becomes a cult.
</p>

<p>
	I've met western Zen Buddhists whose minds are riddled with Buddhist dogma and no direct experience of God.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Blocking Mods is not possible for the same reason that you cannot have a mute button for police. Police have sirens and loudspeakers for a reason.
</p>

<p>
	I keep a very close eye on Mods to make sure they don't abuse their power. If I see a Mod abusing their power, I will act on it swiftly. But I'm mostly very satisfied with the job our current Mod team is doing.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you think something in "unhealthy" from your POV does necessarily mean that I or others will agree. You need to develop some thick skin in an online forum, where people are mostly doing their own thing and I cannot personally micro-manage everyone. People will have different opinions and be at different levels of development.
</p>

<p>
	If someone feels there is abuse by Mods, by all means message me and I will look into it. But you better have a strong case.
</p>

<p>
	#ModLivesMatter
</p>

<p>
	P.S. And if you feel another member is being abusive, report it to me or the Mods. But again, you better make a strong case. We will not tolerate abusive behavior on this forum. But abuse has to be more than a personal offense.

	Green reacting to Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Also notice how Vaush can appreciate the healthy aspects of Blue that Jocko embodies, but also ridicules the excesses. It's a nice example of how the Green value system fundamentally includes healthy Blue as its foundation.

	Notice that you are giving meaninglessness a negative meaning, which is not true meaninglessness.

<p>
	If you do nothing and don't try, that is just as meaningless. Except you will be miserable.

	This forum will never be a Tolle Facebook group. Tolle's audience is mostly 60 year old grannies, and here we have 20-30 year old males. It's gonna be a lot more edgy here.

<p>
	What people don't appreciate is that society has ALWAYS coerced minds into what they are and are not allowed to think. This is nothing new. Because thoughts can be very dangerous. Allowing a true free-flow of thoughts is as dangerous as allowing free-flow of rocket launchers. Hence society has always and will always coerce thought. That is one of society's top functions. Society sets the parameters of legitimate discourse. And of course all these parameters are relative, biased, and selfish -- because they are designed to serve survival, not truth.
</p>

<p>
	Facebook is not under pressure for truth, it is under pressure for survival.

<p>
	Yes.
</p>

<p>
	What remains when you strip your experience of all stories, beliefs, concepts, interpretations, projections?
</p>

<p>
	This seems easy to do or imagine, but what you imagine it will be like is yet another fantasy, not what it will actually be like.
</p>

<p>
	It is very, very tricky to drop all your interpretations of the present moment. You are basically incapable of it from your current state of consciousness. Your state needs to change to allow it.
</p>

<p>
	What I'm suggesting is that you ever succeeding in dropping all your interpretations and projections, you could not even tell the difference between the color red and a taco. You would not know what anything is and you would be completely lost. You would not even know your own name or whether you were ever born.

	In a sense you are right. There is no singular thing called enlightenment. There a millions of different states of consciousness of various levels of self-awareness. Some of them we call "enlightenment" for simplicity sake.

<p>
	But you are also wrong in that a discrete enlightenment experience is definitely possible, it is life-transforming, and you have yet to have one.

<p>
	How can the UN have power when every state wants to be nationalistic and selfish?
</p>

<p>
	The world is too unconscious for the UN to be effective. It's a marriage between children.

	All the major right-wingers are going to becoming increasing more unhinged up to the election. And especially after Trump loses.
</p>

<p>
	They will not re-evaluate the wrongness of their positions. Their minds have been rotted by anti-SJW culture war garbage. They will do endless mental gymnastics and play the biggest victims while fearmongering about communists bringing on the end of America.

<p>
	He is deeply lost in his mind and Christian dogma.
</p>

<p>
	All difference is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	The most significant thing is to realize that all difference is relative and imaginary and that nothing matters. If nothing matters, nothing can go wrong. Hence everything is Love.
</p>

<p>
	Reality has no foundation. Reality is groundless. And that is God. If reality had a foundation, it would be limited and evil. Any infinitely powerful and Good being cannot have a foundation. Foundationalism is evil and this guy is a devil.

<p>
	The source of "morality" is ultimately Love. Love is an absolute, so you could frame that as "objective", but this is not what moralists mean or understand.
</p>

<p>
	All conditional forms of morality are biased and relative.
</p>

<p>
	The only absolute morality is EVERYTHING. So if your morality says that murdering babies is wrong, then you don't understand absolute morality.
</p>

<p>
	Anything that you think is wrong in the Universe, is your own delusion. The Universe is Absolutely Perfect and it cannot be improved in any way.
</p>

<p>
	If Goodness was a obligation, then it wouldn't be Good, it would be evil. The reason God is Good is because it places no obligation on anyone else to be good.
</p>

He's obviously onto something. But his formulations and logic are thoroughly dualistic and will never be sufficient for understanding God.
</p>

<p>
	The Universe didn't come from nothing. It is nothing. Right now.
</p>

<p>
	Also, to frame God as outside the universe is silly. God is the Universe.
</p>

<p>
	This is the problem with academic philosophy: it's purely at the level of logic, concepts, and arguments.
</p>

<p>
	God/Universe caused itself.

	People have different genetics. Your genetics determines how well your body can naturally detox and eliminate heavy metals.

<p>
	Some people can naturally eliminate 90% of heavy metals, while others only 10%. If you are the 10% type, you will be screwed with diseases and conditions for life unless you develop some detox protocols.

<p>
	Of course. That's mostly how Orange is.

	Silent Orange is a scientist in a lab working on a vaccine for Covid or building the next rocketship to Mars. Or a doctor or a computer programmer putting in a solid day's work. Nothing flashy.

<title>How To Remember Trips?</title>

<p>
	Many understandings simply cannot be accessed from your current sober state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	That is okay. The work here is two-fold:
</p>

<p>
	1) You can still gain some insights which stick and can be remembers. Even if you lose 90%, you can still hold on to 10%, which is very significant.
</p>

<p>
	2) You must work on raising your baseline state of consciousness. This is done through classic spiritual practices and also by deeply integrating and working to embody the lesson learned from psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will transform you in subtle ways which are not necessary at the level of symbolic intellect or memory. You don't have to remember a trip to have it grow you. If you trip a lot, each trip will shift up your baseline by like 1%. After a hundred trips, it adds up. It's hard for me to go a day without noticing the Godness that is myself.
</p>

Detox is serious business and the very least you could do is bother to read a book about it. If you can't read a book, then don't do it.

<p>
	The point is to compare apples to apples.
</p>

<p>
	It would be interesting what would have been said about Eckhart Tolle if you had 500 hours of video of him from ages 28 to 35 and you had 22,000 forum posts and some 50,000 YT comments from him.
</p>

<p>
	The thing you gotta take into account is that you guys have a lot more data on me than any other spiritual teacher in existence. So it's much easier to find stuff you don't like.
</p>

<p>
	If you had 50,000 YT comments from Jesus, I wonder what you would find objectionable. If you knew all of Jesus' opinions on dating, sex, diet, environment, politics, race, etc. do you honestly think you would like them all?
</p>

<p>
	Needy is when you're desperately asking another for something.
</p>

<p>
	Like if I came on this forum and started begging you for donations because I didn't have my finances together. People who don't get their shit together end up in a state of desperation for money, sex, a sale, love, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	One of your self-help goals should be to create a state of such abundance that you don't have a desperate need for anything from anyone.
</p>

<p>
	Fill your cup until it runeth over and never gets depleted again. This is how you attract people to you. Nobody wants to be friends with a leech. (Mostly because everyone wants to be the leech themselves.) The secret to life is to surrender all your leeching impulses. Make a commitment to stop being a leech in every area of your life. This is the magic of living selflessly. God is infinite selflessness, infinite giving, infinite abundance.
</p>

	Take a psychedelic and chill the fuck out. You need to discover BEING vs doing.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is about learning to let go and relax.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. But you're absolutely right that "there is something about life that I haven’t figured out yet". Your ego-mind is nudging your towards God.

<p>
	It's far too simplistic and self-centered of an attitude.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are a social species. You cannot ignore the collective aspects of consciousness work. And all religion and spiritual groups always bump up against political problems.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can choose to stick your head in the sand focus solely on your own enlightenment, but that's a rather limited version of spirituality. It lacks what Ken Wilber would call the "We" quadrant.

<p>
	My deepest trips were done without music.
</p>

<p>
	Music is good for lighter trips or to boost mood or in the afterglow phase.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to get some serious work done, turn off the music at the peak.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I said that music can be a distraction is that it becomes too beautiful and hypnotizing, luring the psychonaut away from contemplation. Music on psychedelics is like a siren song. But we don't trip for pleasure, we trip for insight. I'm careful not to turn tripping into a pleasure-seeking activity.

<title>Mainstream society’s war on supplements in Germany</title>

<p>
	Supplements ain't going anywhere.
</p>

<p>
	You can't even ban cocaine or meth effectively, let along supplements.
</p>

<p>
	The mainstream scientific and medical establishment can be very conservative and closedminded about alternative health issues.
</p>

<p>
	But if you ever get truly sick, supplements could save your life.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, life expectancy of people for 99.99999% of history was something like 35. Not to mention all the needless suffering.
</p>

<p>
	And also, every culture has had medicine men as a revered and important role/profession for at least 100,000 years. What is a medicine man but a supplement dealer? Think about it.
</p>

<p>
	Even animals will eat herbs when they get sick. Even animals use supplements.
</p>

<p>
	Making arguments based on what is "natural" is dumb. We live in a highly unnatural world these days. Every gallon of water you drink is filled with mercury, lead, and 100 other toxic chemicals.
</p>

<title>Is it possible to change your personality from shy to outgoing and confident?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/55351-is-it-possible-to-change-your-personality-from-shy-to-outgoing-and-confident/?do=findComment&amp;comment=734335</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	It depends on how you define "personality".
</p>

<p>
	If you define shyness and insecurity and inexperience as part of your personality, then yes, you can change that.
</p>

<p>
	But there will always be an deeper, more fundamental personality which you cannot change. But that personality is not inherently shy.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry about these philosophical issues. Simply go get massive experience socializing and that will fix many of your problems until your question melts away.
</p>

<p>
	I used to be extremely shy and socially insecure, to the point of not being able to have a conversation with a taxi driver or hair stylist or grocery store clerk.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Basically not. The visuals are actually a lesser mode of consciousness. When consciousness becomes maximally infinite, it is pure abstraction. Any form would limit it. If you are seeing some DMT machine elf, that is still a limited form. You'd be better off dropping that form and going for pure abstraction.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bit like art.
</p>

<p>
	Realist art requires a less advanced mind to appreciate and understand.
</p>

<p>
	Abstract art requires an advanced mind to appreciate and understand.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest levels of understanding are pure abstractions.

<title>Leo's toxic rhetoric and an inner conflict</title>

<p>
	Also, consider this:
</p>

<p>
	I deliberately try not to act saintly because that is what makes students worship the teacher and leads to all sorts of unrealistic expectations. You see, if you discover that Ekhart Tolle watched some porn, this would outrage and disgust you because in his public persona he presents this image of a saintly figure. You probably can't even imagine Ekhart Tolle having sex. This entire stereotype is damaging and absurd. Ekhart Tolle's audience would be better served if he said FUCK! once in a while.
</p>

<p>
	The trap is that as a spiritual student to go looking for ever-more saintlier teachers to validate your naive ideas about this work. And once you find this saintliest teacher, he feels so beyond you, so super-human, that you can't help but worship him and believe his every word. And later you discover that he eats meat, has sex, looks at porn, drinks wine, makes mistakes, supports centrist capitalist politicians, avoids paying taxes, hunts animals, kills a fly, gets a divorce, has sex with a hooker in Thailand, gets angry, or whatever else, and your whole fantasy about gurus collapses.
</p>

<p>
	This work is not about acting saintly. It would be best if you dropped this expectation of saintliness. Saintliness is precisely what creates cult followings.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Your revered guru Alan Watts drank himself to death and you can't handle Leo enjoying some porn? I could easily not mention my enjoyment of porn to you, and then you would think I am 50% more saintly. I could further boost my saintliness by 100% by never saying FUCK any more. Ekhart Tolle drinks wine. I don't even drink. So HA!
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that your expectations for my behavior are largely your own fantasy, and I have no obligation play into your fantasy of how conscious people should behave. My only obligation is to not exploit you, not abuse you, and not mislead you into delusion. But if I want to watch some porn, then I will and you'll just have to go cry in the corner I guess.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps so, but that does not excuse conspiratorial theorizing.
</p>

<p>
	The most common way that conspiracy theorists justify their BS speculations is by citing some case in the past where something crazy came true. Then their mind takes that as license to speculate wildly and in a paranoid manner about everything under the sun.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of reality is such that there's a lot of stuff we don't know. But that is not license to feed all your ego's selfish fears and suspicions.

<p>
	I don't think that's an accurate characterization of pedophiles. They were not necessarily emotionally abused. They might simply only be turned on by young people. There isn't necessarily anything "wrong" with them, any more than you being turned on by whatever you are turned on by.
