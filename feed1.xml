<p>
	Research can be selfless. How else can they know about us without interfering with us on a large scale?
</p>

<p>
	Maybe they have tech which can scan a person's mind and extract all the knowledge, data, beliefs, ego development level, etc. But to use that tech they need to abduct a few folks.

<p>
	All sorts of combinations are possible. There are not hard rules.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you pretty much guaranteed to have various profound insights even after your first few awakenings.
</p>

<p>
	Your first few awakenings are not going to make everything crystal clear. You should still have many questions remaining.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: The Many Facets of Awakening

<p>
	His consciousness model is interesting and somewhat useful, but I would not conflate it with Cook-Greuter's work. They are very different.
</p>

<p>
	Any model that tries to map consciousness on a linear scale is extremely problematic. Conscious states are not at all linear or one-dimensional.

<p>
	There are many degrees of this giftedness.
</p>

<p>
	I certainly have some degree of it, but there are people who have it 100x more than me.
</p>

<p>
	I would say that I am mildly gifted. My mind is gifted with extraordinary intuition, holistic intelligence, and wisdom. This has basically always been the case for me. It is not something I worked to achieve. Although my inner work cranked it up to 11. But I am not gifted in the same way that psychics, healers, and yogis are.

	Things will stabilize for you. This is just a phase. Just keep reminding yourself that this is a process and it will stabilize. You just gotta be patient with it. Don't get pushy with it. Let it unfold organically. Be open to wherever it wants to take you.

<p>
	I don't see how it makes a difference. You can crank up the plugged dose as high as you want.
</p>

<p>
	A longer trip is not going to dissolve the ego any less than a short trip, just the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	It's not like you will come back from a 4 hour 5-MeO trip and be like, "Well, that was full nonduality, but it lasted for 4 hours instead of 15 minutes, therefore it isn't permanent enlightenment."

<p>
	There is a difference between abducting a few individuals vs first contact.
</p>

<p>
	First contact means that every culture and country in the world would officially recognize aliens as real. There would be no more doubt or speculation.
</p>

<p>
	The TV news would be wall-to-wall alien coverage. People would be going nuts.

	He's already laying the groundwork.

<p>
	Trump will never admit defeat, even if he loses both the popular vote and electoral college. He has already blamed any future loss on Democrat rigging and fraud. No matter what happens the Democrats will be scapegoated and gaslit for the loss. Everything Trump does to rig the system he will blame on Democrats and progressives.

<p>
	If Trump loses, there's a good chance he's going to prison. Tons of criminal cases pending against him.

<p>
	Which is why he will refuse to leave office. For Trump, leaving office is basically a prison sentence. He needs the immunity.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because humans are not yet evolved enough to take first contact as a positive thing. Humans are so dumb and fearful that we would turn it into paranoia.
</p>

<p>
	These aliens have probably interacted with many other species in the universe so they know from experience which species can handle first contact and which cannot. They probably freaked out and inadvertently hurt many species with contact before they learned the lesson not to interfere until folks are ready for it.
</p>

<p>
	Non-interference is an important aspect of consciousness and love. You don't stick your nose where it don't belong. You don't got derailing the developmental paths of others without good reason.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same reason why God does not do stunts to show itself to people. God has a non-interference policy. The nature of a good being is that it will not force itself upon you because it is conscious that this would hurt you and backfire in the grand scheme of things.
</p>

<p>
	Even us 21st century humans try to keep isolated native tribes free from outside interference.

	You can take that position if you want, but that's not how I teach. I teach practical methods for ordinary people.

<p>
	Neo-Advaita leaves out everyone who isn't lucky enough to get enlightened through doing nothing. Which is 99.999999% of the population.

<p>
	By trying to not leave out some people, you end up leaving out all of them.

<p>
	Telling an ordinary person to do nothing will never awaken them. And even if they get very lucky and do awaken, their awakening will be so weak that I don't even want to call it awakening.

	That's basically the do-nothing technique. It's a good technique. But you won't reach the highest levels of consciousness with it. Not unless you're supernaturally gifted from birth with special brain chemistry.
</p>

<p>
	The present moment is not all there is. You need to change your state of consciousness. Your present state of consciousness NOT God-consciousness.

<p>

	The opposite is the case. THEY create an elite club of 1 in million people who got enlightened through sheer good fortune, and they expect that same good fortune to carry over to everyone else.

		<p>
			But how can you say that antidepressants are worse than placebo when they have been proven to be statistically significantly effective in many studies?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	1) My claim that they were worse than placebo had more to do with their negative side-effects, not their lack of positive effects. My point was that in the NET they are not worth it. I do think they produce some positive side-effects that you will not get with mere placebo since they alter brain chemistry similar to a psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	2) There are many conflicting studies because this is a complex issue. Some studies show that stuff like exercise and other basic practices are as effective if not more effective than anti-depressants. But also, people react to anti-depressants very differently, so it is a great mistake to speak of these drugs in the aggregate, The only thing that ultimately matters is how they affect you personally. For some people it will be helpful and for others it will not. The problem is that these studies do not look at individuals but aggregate data.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, I don't think anti-depressants will solve any fundamental problem. The vast majority of people who take anti-depressants do so because they are clueless of their true effects and because they have no idea that their depression is caused by other root factors which anti-depressants will not correct, only making things worse. And doctors mainly prescribe them because they have no idea of how human psychology or consciousness works and they are corrupted by Big Pharma money. The whole thing is a fucking disaster and a tragedy of ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Also take into account that many of these studies are corrupted by Big Pharma money and agendas, so they cannot be taken at face value. And they do not properly account for negative side-effects or alternative holistic treatments.

<p>
	It's definitely not that. No human technology is remotely capable of what UFOs are reported to do.
</p>

<p>
	Occam's Razor is that they are simply ETs. Super-plausible given how many planets exist out there.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are rather stupid to expect ETs to just land on the White House lawn. They would never do that. No intelligent beings would so disturb the development path of entire species in such a way.
</p>

<p>
	And if they were hostile, they would have already easily killed us.
</p>

<p>
	So if ETs are flying around us, they will be highly intelligent and highly benevolent.
</p>

	Let's force the Neo-Advaitan into such a corner that he has to deny Buddha's enlightenment. That will be entertaining.

<p>
	This is context-dependent and relativistic.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, cause and effect is a dualistic notion. From the absolute perspective cause & effect chains are infinite.
</p>

<p>
	But that is a misleading conflation of the absolute and relative domains. When a student asks a Neo-Advaitan teacher about what he can do to become enlightened, saying, "There's nothing you can do because you're already enlightened and cause & effect does not exist" is a foolish answer because obviously the student's question is coming from the relative domain. In the relative domain there is much you can do, like stick some 5-MeO-DMT up your ass.
</p>

<p>
	In the absolute sense you can argue that sticking 5-MeO-DMT up your ass does not cause enlightenment because cause and effect aren't real. But the simple fact remains: if a student sticks enough 5-MeO-DMT up his ass, he will get enlightenment. It's simple, practical, and scientific. No BS games.
</p>

<p>
	There is no contradiction in saying that you can and that you cannot bring about enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	It works just like fishing. Can you bring about a fish from a lake? Not directly. You cannot ever know when the fish will bite.
</p>

<p>
	But you would be a total fool to take that to mean that there is no skill to fishing. The difference in how much fish a skilled fisherman will catch vs one who is just randomly throwing hooks in the water is about 10,000%
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, the Neo-Advaitan claim is just strictly false because I can consistently bring about enlightenment via 5-MeO-DMT in 15 minutes every single time, any time I want. So the idea that nothing can be done to bring about enlightenment is simply false. Furthermore, the idea that ego cannot take action that will bring about enlightenment is also simply false. You can easily disprove both these claims for yourself with psychedelics. And of course it doesn't stop with psychedelics. You can also do it with meditation, concentration, yoga, visualization, prayer, mantras, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that spiritual practices do not bring about awakening is just absurd and counter to common sense because spiritual techniques would not exists unless they were effective for some people.
</p>

<p>
	And the greatest absurdity of the entire Neo-Advaitan position is the most canonical enlightenment of all time: The Buddha. The Buddha used his ego to generate his enlightenment by forcing himself to sit under the fucking tree.
</p>

<p>
	So the next time a Neo-Advaitan tells you it's impossible to create enlightenment, tell them: But what about the Buddha? And then watch them begin their mental gymnastics.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that the Buddha would have become enlightened without doing his 7 years of hardcore practice is laughable.
</p>

<p>
	Ego plays a crucial role in bootstrapping enlightenment. Without the proper ego, there will be no enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	I would assume they look after our nukes out of compassion and love -- to make sure we don't kill ourselves. But they must do so in a light-handed way, so as not to interfere with our development.

	Like, maybe if an accidental nuke is launched, they might zap it and we would chalk it up to mechanical failure.

	I doubt Joe will be up for it in 2024. He's getting too old. I think there might be a push for someone young and more progressive.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see Kamala being president. She didn't get enough interest in the primaries and dropped out real early. She will definitely try to run for president again, but I doubt she will succeed. There will be more interesting choices in 2024 and she likely won't excite enough people. But I think she's a good VP pick for Joe.

<p>
	A) Because US culture is dominant online and around the world. If a UFO was seen in Russia, Peru, or India, you would never hear about it in western mainstream culture.
</p>

<p>
	B) I think there might be a connection between UFOs and nuclear launch facilities. Which might explain why they became so popular in the 1950's and 60's, and in the US. If UFOs are real, then they would probably have a special interest in military installations and weapon systems. Which might explain why there are so many military-related sightings.

<p>
	Him or the likes of Ben Shapiro.
</p>

<p>
	Once Trump fades away, the biggest question will be: What form does conservatism take in America? In a post-Trump political world, I think a lot of right-wing celebrities and talk show hosts will start vying for the top role.

	Yes, we've seen this and discussed it before here many times. Use the search function.

<p>
	Seems like UFOs are legit. Not a conspiracy theory (unless you make it into one).

<p>
	You've choose a mission which is a bit like: I want to teach people how to ice skate uphill.
</p>

<p>
	It would be wiser to focus your teachings and services on those people who are actually suited to it.
</p>

<p>
	An important aspect of the life purpose course is articulating your strengths and playing up to them. Design your LP around your strengths, not your weakness.
</p>

<p>
	Also consider this very important distinction: teaching people how to sing is not the same thing as being a great singer yourself. You might be a bad singer but a great teacher. So clarify what you really want: do you want to be a singer or a teacher?
</p>

<p>
	Rather than teaching everyone under the sun, teach those who show promise.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe in theory you could teach anyone to sing, but is that really worth the effort? Maybe it is. I dunno. But maybe it isn't.
</p>

<p>
	Just as a comparison, teaching everyone calculus is unnecessary and I would even say harmful, because most people are not suited to it and don't need it. Calculus should only be taught to those who really need it and have a knack for it.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I am interested in both.
</p>

<p>
	You can have an ego-death but still not be conscious of God.
</p>

<p>
	Usually ego-death comes as the result of high consciousness, but that doesn't mean it is the highest level of consciousness. There is much to become conscious of beyond ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	It seems to be a lot easier to reach ego-death than consciousness of God. And then there are many degrees of depth of God consciousness. The first few levels are pretty shallow. It takes many awakenings to get to the really deep levels, where you finally start to understand what God is, why it is, how it is, what it's doing, what it wants, etc.

<p>
	The limited stages come from when you're not conscious enough to be in the ultimate stage.
</p>

<p>
	Polarization of light is the best analogy. The purest form of light is pure white, which contains all the others. The other colors are what happens when white light gets de-unified. If you re-unify all the light in the world, you will just be left with pure white (which contains all the rest within its whiteness).

	Yeah, but 200,000 Americans have died, and probably double that will die in the next year. And the damage to the economy is worse than a nuclear terrorist attack.

<p>
	It looks however you imagine it looks. Which is not to say your image is wrong, but also don't hold it as the one exclusive way it is.

	He talks about it in one of his books. Can't recall which one. Perhaps the one about Truth vs Falsehood.

	He incorrectly ranks post-modernism as less developed and less conscious than Ben Shapiro's brand of conservatism. Which is just embarrassing.

<p>
	We already have that. There are 100s of people akin to Jesus alive and teaching today.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru is one obvious example of a modern day Jesus type. And there are hundreds of others. It's just that everyone takes such people for granted. The only reason you put Jesus on a pedestal is because of a relentless 2000 year old marketing campaign. Jesus got $50 trillion dollars worth of free marketing. Good luck competing with that.

<p>
	There actually is almost no historical evidence.
</p>

<p>
	The only evidence of Jesus is from the Bible and the various Gospels, none of which are objective or strictly historical records.
</p>

<p>
	Atheists don't doubt it because they are materialists and they don't understand how mystical teachings could be transmitted through highly metaphorical teachings. To an atheist the easiest explanation for Jesus was that he was some cult leader or charlatan.

<p>
	B) He might have been a super-naturally gifted mystic what was born with a very high state of baseline consciousness. If he did exist, I don't think he was an ordinary enlightened human. He was in a state of consciousness inaccessible to 99.9999% of humans.

<p>
	Because when such things are organized they are easily abused and turn into cults because they are not moderated or supervised.
</p>

<p>
	You are free to meet up with people you meet on this forum through PM. But don't organize any large gatherings publicly. I know plenty of people meet up one on one through PM connections. That is fine. The risk there is on you.

</p>

<p>
	Rather than trying to grasp at straws, it's best to simply admit that you simply do not have a direct experience or God or Love. That's okay to admit. It is better to work from a blank slate than some twisted ideas and vague speculations.

			Please contemplate how far you take this. For example it is not (yet) true for me that God is love. And thats one of your core teachings. Would you ban me if i posted a thread giving arguments against God is love? You locked a thread from a guy who said God does not exist. Is spiritually disagreeing with you considered troll behavior? If so I don’t think the title “self-improvement forum” is appropriate anymore. That would be too broad if you are narrowing your forum down to your core teachings. Just sayin.

<p>
	You can question the topics of God or Love if you are genuinely confused about them and desire to learn and to seek further clarification. But if you are going to take a denialist attitude that God and Love are BS, then you will eventually be banned because I'm not going to entertain such pig-headedness.
</p>

<p>
	God and Love are so fundamental to my teachings that if you disagree with me on these things, you should not be following my work.

<p>
	So.....
</p>

<p>
	After years of running this forum and watching things unfold, I have come to a firm decision that what this place has been lacking from the very beginning is a high bar for quality. People who join here get the impression that since this is a "public" forum, they should be free to spout whatever nonsense their ego wants. They get the impression that this forum is just like any other dumping ground on the internet. Well, not any more.
</p>

<p>
	My initial attitude towards this forum was to moderate as little as possible and to be as lenient as possible, treating everyone with kid gloves and giving them many second-chances to correct themselves. Unfortunately, people who post crap are usually people who are incapable of correcting themselves. It's become clear to me now that such a permissive attitude drags down the quality of the entire forum and makes this place unappealing for my most serious students. It is also a giant waste of time to deal with.
</p>

<p>
	So, from now on, this forum will not only be moderated for all the basic, common-sense guidelines which are necessary to keep an online community from turning into a toxic troll-hive, we are going one step further to moderate for quality. Posters who are unable to demonstrate a certain moderate level of ego maturity and show a certain moderate level of post quality will now be banned. The bottom line is this: to be a member of this forum is to be part of a special class of human who is able to conduct him/herself with a certain maturity, wisdom, openness of mind, humility, intellectual honesty, kindness, compassion, thoughtfulness, and well-spokenness. The kind work we do here requires a relatively high level of maturity which, unfortunately, many in the general online population are just not capable of -- and as of today we will no longer be accommodating to such people. There are plenty of places on the internet where such people can congregate. Actualized.org should not be one of them.
</p>

<p>
	I've updated our <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/guidelines/" rel="">Forum Guidelines</a> to reflect this. Please read and adhere to them. It's really not too much to ask. Our Mods will now be keeping an eye out for low quality posts and immature posters, issuing more warnings and bans than before. But if you are a mature and thoughtful member here, you shouldn't have anything to worry about. I know 90% of folks here are good folks and post quality stuff. It's the bottom 10% that we want to cull. So just don't be that guy.
</p>

<p>
	Thank you for your support. Let's raise the bar and make this the best community for serious self-actualization work.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Of course I will be accused of "censorship" by some for this decision. So be it. Quality stuff doesn't happen without filters. For every troll or ignoramus that we allow here, we lose at least one serious member who doesn't have time to deal that shit. By being too lax, it's the best members who end up punished.
</p>

<p>
	Trump had already gotten those sweet biz deals from the Russians long ago. Russians were buying most of his overpriced apartments and condos, effectively laundering money through him.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's entire real estate biz was a money laundering scheme.

</p>

<p>
	It's very common.
</p>

<p>
	As you do inner work, as you improve your self-esteem, as you erect healthy boundaries with men, as you become more conscious -- your relationships with men will become a lot better. If not, they won't.

<p>
	You can probe deeper into Consciousness to realize that its true nature is nothing/emptiness. But that is still Consciousness as I conceive of it. It is Consciousness realizing its own nature through self-reflection.

<p>
	This is a very simplistic and reductionistic perspective.
</p>

<p>
	You transcend the mind and body, but the mind and body is still a huge part of your human incarnation.
</p>

<p>
	Not taking care of your body and mind, being addicted, being broke -- these things will strengthen ego and make you miserable.
</p>

<p>
	At your current stage -- which I can tell isn't very high -- I would worry less about transcendence and more about mastering basic survival, so you are a fully-functioning and mature ego.
</p>

<p>
	Then you can shift focus to transcendence. You will simply not be capable of transcending if your ego is underdeveloped.

Do you see Art, Programming, and other mediums like those just as tools to develop something? Do you see a value in learning for example web development just for its sake? I mean, isn't what you develop more important than the tools you use?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's the point having a clear life purpose. So you can know what your mission is and what are the tools and means by which to get there.
</p>

<p>
	I would definitely not put the medium as my life purpose. The medium is just one expression of my life purpose. This gives you the flexibility to change mediums while staying on purpose, and finding the medium which is more conducive to the fulfillment of your purpose.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, some people just fucking love art or programming for its own sake. And there's nothing wrong with that per se, Your purpose might be to just explore the craft of art or programming your entire life.

			I'm asking that because currently, I work as a web developer in a company, but from childhood (I'm 24 now), I also loved art and played with Graphics software and drew well too (I draw sometimes even today). Now I'm torn between those two domains because if I transition from a developer's position and start learning Art and Graphics, I'd struggle financially, lose a couple of years of coding experience, network of people, etc. I also like what I'm doing right now, but I also want to do much more <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" /> I think a life lived in coding 8-10 hours a day is a waste...
		</p>

		<p>
			I think you make some bold career transitions in your life.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Sounds like you answered your own question there.
</p>

<p>
	Follow your passion, despite the short-term costs. Of course there will be short-term costs to transitions careers/domains/mediums. But in the long-term you will win by following your heart, which seems to be art.
</p>

<p>
	You can find gradual and strategic ways to transitions such that you don't immediately just quit your day job.
</p>

<p>
	Art and programming also happen to dovetail so well that you can easily create an niche which is a 50/50 blend of the two. Technical artists can be highly valued and well-paid. Dev teams badly need technical artists. You can either turn this into your end-goal, or it could just be a stepping stone towards a full transition into art some years later. There's plenty of flexibility here.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest thing you should fear is wasting your life doing things your heart isn't into.

<p>
	Of course it depends on how you define your terms. But I don't like the term "energy". People like to throw that term around without any clear sense or definition of what it means. They use it in a wishy-washy way, where energy can mean anything.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you mean by energy, it is an aspect of consciousness. You are conscious of energy. So consciousness holds "energy" inside itself, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
	I prefer the term consciousness rather than energy. The nice thing about the term consciousness is that it already implies that consciousness can be less or more conscious. That's just baked into what consciousness is and does. Just like how light can be less or more intense. Nobody thinks of light as a static thing. We think of light in terms of various intensities.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is light, doesn't guarantee its very intense light.
</p>

<p>
	In theory you would learn it more comprehensively in a formal art school.
</p>

<p>
	But this not strictly necessary. You can also teach much of it to yourself. But you'll have to put in the time and energy.
</p>

<p>
	There is a significant difference between formal art training vs simply watching 3DsMax tutorials. Technical software skills are NOT art fundamentals.
</p>

<p>
	I have a good grasp of 3DsMax and Photoshop, but I have very little grasp of art fundamentals. Which is why I'm not a great artist. But I can model a dragon in 3DsMax. But it won't be an awesome work of art. Hence studios would be fools to hire me as a 3D artist.
</p>

<p>
	For me to become a great artist I would need serious formal art training. Not just some online software tutorials. To be a great artist you must study the aesthetics of life: form, shape, lines, curves, colors, composition, symmetry, light, shadow, objects, anatomy, etc.

	What then remains is any number of different states of consciousness, from infinitely low to infinitely high and anything in between.

<p>
	This is incorrect, since there is nothing but states of consciousness. To say that something is consciousness means to say that it is in some state of consciousness. This state could be low or high or any infinite shades in between.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be "no states of consciousness". Even if consciousness is formless or empty, that too is a state of consciousness. The null state. And by definition a rock is not a null state, otherwise you wouldn't call it a rock.

	No, this doesn't follow at all. It means a very contracted, limited state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible for you to become a rock and experience what it feels like to exist as a rock. This will not be Infinite Consciousness. It will be a very narrow, finite consciousness. Although it may feel like it lasts forever, since a rock doesn't have a sense of time.

<p>

<p>
	No. There are an infinite number of different and valid ways to express yourself and help raise the consciousness of mankind.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming a monk is only for the most hardcore people who REALLY deeply want that kind of lifestyle. If you want to be a monk you should feel it resonate in your bones.

Anatomy, sculpture, drawing, color theory, composition, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The most impressive thing Art Directors look for when hiring 3D artists is whether they have that traditional artistic knowledge. Since that is hardest to teach. They care less about your technical software skills. Although of course technical software skills are important to develop your portfolio. But what you should really highlight is your understanding of traditional art, anatomy, and form. If you can demonstrate a solid classical understanding of art, you shouldn't have a problem getting hired and even trained on the job in new software.
</p>

<p>
	Be a good artist first, and a 3D artist second. Because good art is the foundation for good 3D art.
</p>

<p>
	When you try to pitch yourself to employers, don't lead with your technical skills, lead with your fundamental mastery of your craft, whether that be art, programming, design, business, or whatever. Demonstrate that you have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of your sub-field. Demonstrate mastery and excellent grasp of your sub-field. Then your technical skills are the cherry on top.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, this assumes too much. You assume a perfect correlation between surrender and consciousness, which just isn't the case. There is some correlation in general, but it's far from perfect. You can be in a state of zero self/ego, but still not be infinitely conscious.
</p>

<p>
	A rock has no self/ego. It is fully surrendered. But it is not very conscious at tall.
</p>

<p>
	You guys keep conflating all these different facets and dimensions of consciousness, and that's because you haven't deeply explored all the various states that consciousness can take on. Hence your view of consciousness is very one-dimensional. It's sort of like the difference between someone who's lived in one country his whole life vs someone who's traveled the world. If you ask the one-country guy about how the world is, he will give you a very narrow picture based on his little corner of the world which he has assumed is the same everywhere else. If you ask the word-traveler, he will regale you weird tails of alien and unbelievable cultures that will hardly make any sense because you had to be there to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	Teachings like Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta make consciousness seem very one-dimensional. Because that's all you get through meditation and self-inquiry. You can't shift your consciousness significantly enough via those methods. Hence you end up confusing the limits of those methods with the limits of consciousness itself. Which is a great delusion.

	If you want the truly ultimate stage, it is an Infinite Singularity of Consciousness/Love that increases endlessly without end, forever.
</p>

<p>
	It is a ONENESS so complete that the entire universe is extinguished forever into a infinite field of pure indifference.
</p>

<p>
	The final stage is simply:

<p>
	INFINITY/LOVE

			You are contradicting yourself here, Leo, because I know for a fact that you have a dream of being in a "state of God-consciousness" (5-MeO/DMT-like) 24/7. So in that sense you are searching for a specific permanent condition, although you may 'externally' have given up on it as of late. Of course, the search itself is probably the reason it ain't already the case; God's favorite game in town: hide'n'seek.

<p>
	No, I am speaking from the POV of Truth. From the POV of Truth it makes no difference how long a thing lasts. A lightening bolt is as true is as the moon. Ironically it is the ego-mind which gives higher value to permanent things than to temporary ones.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the ego would love to live in a constantly high state. But that is irrelevant from the POV of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously expanding one's consciousness makes one feel more powerful, since Power = Infinite Consciousness. This is not a problem, it's a feature of God. I do not seek higher consciousness to gain more power. I seek higher consciousness for its own sake, and any power that comes from that pursuit is merely a happy side-effect.

	Again, this is to grossly oversimplify things.

<p>
	God is Consciousness and it desires to be conscious of itself. You can call it a "game" if you want, but it's the only game in town and this "game" is what God IS.

	But notice, although you speak of not playing the game, here you are still playing the game. If you were truly infinitely conscious you would not be here in human form. The very fact that you are in a human form is proof that you are not willing to surrender the playing of the game. You are merely pretending to not be playing the game when you are fully involved in it.
</p>

<p>
	And the reason you're doing this is because you are not infinitely consciousness. You're stuck in lower consciousness while telling yourself you've "arrived", that you're "done". Well, you're kidding yourself.

<p>
	Yes, God of course. But here's the point: You don't understand what God is until you've actually been infinitely conscious.
</p>

<p>
	For God to know itself it must explore itself by expanding its consciousness. God must explore the low and high.

	What I'm talking about has nothing to do with controlling or manipulating reality or being "free". All that is irrelevant to consciousness.

<p>
	Yes, but you are not fully conscious of what consciousness is or can do.
</p>

<p>
	A rock is consciousness/God, but it is not infinitely conscious of itself as that. Neither is a human.
</p>

<p>
	You can be a rock if you want. A rock is surrendered and liberated. But it ain't conscious of much.
</p>

<p>
	To me this work is not about becoming a rock. But it seems that's what you want to make this work into. Well, enjoy being a rock. But don't expect me to join you in that. I got slightly higher aims <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />

<p>
	People get lost in the content differences while not seeing the structural similarities. The problem with Nazis was not their content but their structure.

<p>
	You don't need to be programmer to do game dev. There are many other roles:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Producer
	</li>
	<li>
		Designer
	</li>
	<li>
		Level design
	</li>
	<li>
		Art
	</li>
	<li>
		Audio
	</li>
	<li>
		PR/marketing/sales
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The way to break into games is simple: you work on your own little projects, building up skills, and developing a solid, polished portfolio which you then show off to employers. Attending game's conferences like GDC and networking with your portfolio in-hand can open many doors.
</p>

<p>
	Starting game design is easier than ever today thanks to powerful and cheap tools like Unity, Unreal, or many of the modding toolkits like that of Skyrim, Fallout, or other games.
</p>

<p>
	One of the easiest ways to get hired is to create a solid and popular mod for a popular game like Fallout/Skyrim. As new games are released, start modding them and posting your work for fans to give you feedback and reviews. Designing board games or pen and paper games is also a good way to build up your design skills.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, as long as you have the skills and can demonstrate them, you will get hired. The trick is developing the skills. This requires some years of committed work and a plan.
</p>

<p>
	I could write an entire course on how to become a top notch game designer and get hired by the best studios.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There's no way forward in life so long as your mind is full of those recirculating toxic beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	I had to do a lot of busting of my limiting beliefs when I was starting out in this work.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, your potential in life is so monstrously huge that your mind will not believe it is real. It sounds too much like a pipe dream. The mind needs to be whipped into opening itself.
</p>

	Heavy metal toxicity
</p>

<p>
	You can try doing detox
</p>

<p>
	After detox I went from sleeping 9 hours and feeling tired to sleeping 6.5-7 hours and feeling energetic. It can make a huge difference.

<p>
	That's what happens when you start to self-actualize. You see more and more how much time and potential you squandered by doing other useless shit like a monkey.
</p>

<p>
	That deep regret is a sign of you becoming more conscious. Most people are so asleep they never even know what they missed. They live and die in blissful ignorance.

Knowing how to flirt and charm a girl will not help you in other areas of your life much. Confidence humor and not being a wimp will though
		</p>

<p>
	Of course it's both.
</p>

<p>
	There are many technical aspects of game if you want to get really good. But there are also general principles of being more attractive and high value as a man. Ideally you master both.
</p>

<p>
	No amount of high value will help you if you cannot do such a simple technical feat as open your mouth and talk to girl you've never met before, and do it in a charming, non-creepy, non-panicked way.

<p>
	It's gonna be very tough to fine client unless you have connections within the self-help industry.
</p>

<p>
	That can be a long-term goal of yours, but I don't see how it will be immediately viable because people who need self-help websites is very narrow and specialized. How you gonna find such people. You need a lead-building strategy for that to work.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to niche in web development, I would look for a niche which is lucrative and has lots of demand. Like e-commerce or the like. This way you can bootstrap your biz. Later you can try to transition it to self-help if that's your jazz.

			Are you sure about that? Here are some examples of things that happened to me in the past few months:<br />
			 
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Have been going to a sort of stage green connection building / spirituality events that used to be held in my city every week pre - covid. Never went there with any intention other than to enjoy myself, nor have I ever deliberately "tried" to get a girl from there. Ended up in bed with 5 different girls I've met there.
			</li>
			<li>
				Went to a riverside campfire party a friend invited me to, about 10 people. As it ended and everyone was about to leave, I've asked if I could crash at anyone's place for the night. One girl invited me over. We have talked for a bit during the party and got along pretty well, but it wasn't particularly remarkable or even flirty, just some friendly chats. While on the way to her place, we have been talking a bit more, just a friendly conversation, not flirty or sexy in any way. After we arrived at her place, we laid down in bed next to each other. We started cuddling for a bit, 5 minutes fast forward, and we started to have amazing sex
			</li>
			<li>
				I am a member of a Facebook Self-help group for people who are trying to start a spiritual business. Members regularly connect with each other to help each other out in their business-building and personal growth processes. Had a video call with another female member of the group. Guess what happened 2 weeks later.
			</li>
			<li>
				Member of another Facebook Self-help group for dealing with specific emotional issues. Same story.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			At this point, I don't even care about getting girls at all anymore. They just keep stumbeling into my life unexpectedly every now and then, without me having to put any efford into it. <br />
			<br />
			But it haven't always been like that. I used to be extremely shy, and was only able to talk to girls at all whilst drunk, and was very depressed about that fact. <br />
			Well I've startet trying to improve in that for a little while. I've watched some of yours and other peoples videos, and I went to two workshops. A little bit of improvement happened, but not to the degree where I was even remotely satisfied.<br />
			<br />
			Then what happened is, I did some mushrooms and became conscious of the fact that me desperately wanting to have sex all the time is only causing me pain and lots of it. SO just like that, I startet valuing my mental and emotional health more than sex. So while still having a strong desire for sex within, I just stopped caring about that desire actually getting fulfilled or not. <br />
			Then, the stuff mentioned above started to happen. Magic! <img alt="9_9" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/rolleyes.gif" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/rolleyes@2x.png 2x" title="9_9" width="20" />
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, that is a kind of action-taking
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, it seems you are fairly natural with girls. Some people have it much harder, requiring more effort. If you have above average looks and social skills, attracting girls can be effortless. But not everyone is so lucky.
</p>

<p>
	And also, don't confuse luck with skill.
</p>

<p>
	From what I have found, DMSA + ALA + zeolite is the best and most proven combo.
</p>

<p>
	Cilantro, chlorela, and spirulina are also said to be good, but probably not as powerful as the above.

<p>
	Which is why urine tests need to done provoked with DMSA and ALA. Then you can see how much is being pulled from your organs.
</p>

<p>
	You can do one urine test unprovoked, and a second one provoked. The difference between them will show you how much is coming out of your organs.

			Metal fillings contain elemental mercury. Poorly absorbed, mostly excreted and the daily dose you get is absolutely negligible compared to things like canned tuna containing high amounts of methyl-mercury. This form is readily absorbed, may even cross the blood-brain barrier and wreak havoc in your brain.  
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	This is incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	Elemental mercury is highly dangerous, more so than methyl-mercury for the brain. Methyl-mercury cannot cross the blood-brain barrier while elemental mercury can. Elemental mercury does, however, have low bio-availability if ingested. But mercury can be inhaled, not just ingested since mercury gives off fumes. Metal fillings aren't so much ingested as they give off fumes. So metal fillings are a very serious problem if you got them.

<title>Insight: Consciousness Cannot Suffer</title>

<p>
	It's more accurate to frame it as: consciousness can suffer, but it doesn't have to.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is just one of an infinite number of things that can be held within consciousness, like the color red, or a bird, or time. Consciousness can hold it, or not hold it.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that Trumpists think Trump does anything out of altruism -- "for the good of the people" -- rather than to increase his ego, is laughable.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's only motivation, ever, is whatever most benefits him personally.

<p>
	That's far too narrow a view. To become an attractive man you shouldn't put "getting laid" as your highest priority.
</p>

<p>
	Build an attractive lifestyle which YOU are in love with. This will attract women.

<p>
	That's because I hesitate to give advice to women because, 1) I am biased in this area, 2) I don't have experience dating as a woman.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you asking a dude for lady dating advice? Ask an experienced lady.
</p>

<p>
	You can easily re-tune that list for women if you sit down and contemplate it a bit. This isn't rocket science.

<p>
	I am not talking about physical strength.
</p>

<p>
	And, sure, you can always get lucky by accident. I am talking about developing oneself in to a strong man. The benefits of this go far beyond simply getting girls.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you could get laid easily as is, you do not want to be a weak man.
</p>

<p>
	Your guys' thinking on this topic is far too narrow. As if getting laid is all that matters. What matters more is how powerful you are in the way you live your life.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't muster the courage to approach a girl, how the fuck are you gonna live a powerful life? You will be just as weak in other areas of your life.

	If your fillings are metal, you should get them replaced with ceramic before doing chelation. Otherwise you could really damage your body as chelation will move metal from your fillings into your brain and organs.

	Yes, no different than if you were a man in a conservative small town, and started saying you're a woman.

	Trump is 1000% uglier in private than in public and stories of his private ugliness will leak out for decades to come. But none of it will convince Trumpists.

<p>
	By this point, any decent person understands that Trump is rotten to the core and a menace to democracy.

<p>
	Nothing. It just takes some courage and confidence in yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't muster the courage to even walk up and introduce yourself, why on earth would she ever let you inside her legs? A weak guy like you doesn't deserve a hot girl.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to become a strong guy. Strong guys get hot girls.
</p>

<p>
	When you want something in life, you have to be willing to work your ass off for it. Amazing shit is not just gonna land in your lap. You must BUILD what you want. Do you want to be a strong guy? Then BUILD it! Don't ask "But how?" Just get started.

		Dressing better
	</li>
	<li>
		Having a strong sense of life purpose and direction
	</li>
	<li>

</ul>

<p>
	You could invest 10 years of full time work developing all that.
</p>

<p>
	None of it is necessary to get laid, but all of it ups your value.
</p>

<p>
	Bottom line: become awesome, and awesome people will gravitate towards you. Or stay lame, and lame people will gravitate towards you. But don't expect to have awesome people in your life while you're lame and too lazy to change yourself. A lazy, sloppy, victim attitude instantly makes you repulsive, since you are a value-leech, expecting something for nothing. If you want something special you must be eager to work for it.

<p>
	Of course!
</p>

<p>
	You act like this is some special handicap unique to you.
</p>

<p>
	Literally EVERY guy struggles with this. Even experienced PUAs still get approach anxiety on their first few sets of the night. That's why warm up sets are so important, and building up state.
</p>

<p>
	You really need to watch some old school RSD videos circa 2012, where all this is explained and addressed.
</p>

<p>
	There is no trick to overcoming this problem. You must do hundred of approaches by facing your fears. You will realize all your fears are illusions. But no amount of logic will resolve this. Only approaching will.
</p>

<p>
	You overcome it by realizing you're being a pussy, and by forcing yourself to approach regardless of how you feel.

<p>
	If there are 70 different genders, you can certainly choose to be whatever race you want.
</p>

<p>
	In theory, there's no reason why a white person couldn't identify with being more black than white. Rapper like Eminem comes to mind. If a white guy grows up in the hood, immersed in black culture, then he's probably more black than white at the level of the mind.

<p>
	You can significantly increase your value.

<p>
	Stop thinking of value merely as looks.

<p>
	Exactly. Tradeoffs.
</p>

<p>
	It is every girl's dream to catch a player and lock him down.
</p>

<p>
	Well, it's playing with fire. Maybe you can lock him down, maybe you can't. Depends on what you're offering.
</p>

<p>
	Dating is a sort of market auction system where buyers and sellers have to meet each other's value propositions.
</p>

<p>
	The better you make yourself the higher your bids can be. The key, as with other areas of life, is to bring massive value to the negotiating table. Then you can get what you want. But most people are too lazy to up their value. They want to leech value.

So if a guy seems too smooth to be true, how do you think he got that smooth?
</p>

<p>
	Non-player guys are gonna be more reserved, more shy, more awkward, slower, not as sexy or charming, not as charismatic, not as funny, more plain and boring.

	You're still super young and no one will care about your age. What employers care about is your demonstrable skill set and portfolio.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get hired as an artist, all you need is a great portfolio. You don't even need a degree and your age is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	All of your attention should be focused on building your skills and putting together a jaw-dropping portfolio.
</p>

<p>
	Artists get hired solely on their portfolios.

</p>

<p>
	Find what lights you up.
</p>

<p>
	A masters degree is not gonna guarantee you any jobs. To get good jobs you must build a solid portfolio and marketable skills. Not degrees.
</p>

<p>
	You can get a temporary job now while you figure out your true passions.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need an MA in economics to find a decent job.

<p>
	Being successful in your life purpose can make it much easier to meet new people through your reputation, status, expertise, celebrity, etc.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you are a semi-successful musician or actor or public speaker, it will be very easy to get laid simply because of how visible you are.
</p>

<p>
	How often you get laid is directly proportional to how many new people are seeing you.

<p>
	It is a fact that you can be more conscious than you currently are.
</p>

<p>
	End of story.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone is in the present moment, but that doesn't mean everyone is equally conscious of it.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sick of arguing against this neo-Advaita over-simplified shit which refuses to acknowledge differences in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you are surrendered to the present moment does not mean you are deeply conscious of anything.
</p>

<p>
	What I care about is CONSCIOUSNESS, not surrender and not liberation and not freedom from suffering and not lack of ego and not some permanent condition. But CONSCIOUSNESS!
</p>

<p>
	It makes no difference to me how long it lasts or what its consequences are.

<p>
	Not really. They tend to be anti-addictive.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, if you are irresponsible, anything can be psychologically addictive. But it is not physically addictive at all and it has no withdrawal.
</p>

<p>
	Don't do anything just because you hear me talking about it. You must feel compelled to do it of your own volition, not because someone tells you to.

<p>
	No, I'm just saying that you can hook a girl whilst being a deadbeat. This happens all the time because girls don't get attracted by your money or job, they get attracted to how much you emotionally stimulate them.
</p>

<p>
	You can emotionally stimulate a girl without a job, or whilst having an amazing job. Of course having an amazing job makes you more of a long-term catch and gives you even higher value. But you can still appear high value without a job at all if you're very charismatic, for example.

<p>
	Sounds like you're simply conscious of what God and Love are.
</p>

<p>
	God is everything that exists. Love is everything that exists.
</p>

<p>
	If it exists, it is God/Love. Hence rape is God/Love.
</p>

<p>
	Don't you find it odd that you believe that God created the universe, and yet you somehow think God didn't create rape???
</p>

<p>
	If God didn't create rape, who did?

<p>
	There are many degrees of infinity.
</p>

<p>
	And they are worth accessing.
</p>

<p>
	If you are interested in Consciousness, then reaching higher degrees of infinity is something you should be interested in.
</p>

<p>
	You can discover ever deeper layers to how reality is constructed. This is not just chasing states. This is profound, life-changing stuff. This is a pursuit for those who actually care to understand how reality works at the deepest levels.

<p>
	Liberation may be one thing, but understanding is something else.

	I bet that a lot of professional women in their 30's and 40's who work boring corporate jobs but make good salaries would kill to have a player boyfriend who fucks her real good and provides her an outlet to be playful and go on adventures.

<p>
	Girls just wanna have fun and feel their feminine side. Which the proper guy can do for her. That's when she falls hard in love, and he can then exploit her emotional soft spot for him.

<p>
	DARE program was not about educating truth about drugs. DARE was a program to demonize drugs and indocrinate abstinence.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between sex abstinence programs vs proper sex ed and handing out free condoms and free birth control and free STD tests. And actually teaching how to have high quality, deep sex.
</p>

<p>
	It is insane that we do not teach teens how to have high quality sex! Truly the Dark Ages.

	The fantasy is thinking that we can agree on some rules and that's the end of the story. All rules must evolve and all rules have exceptions.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to play the game of agreeing to some rules and then pretending that these rules were not merely an agreement but objective reality handed down by God.

But it's also not entirely right.
</p>

<p>
	I gurantee you are nowhere close to infinitely conscious. So this thing you call "enlightenment", or just being in the present moment, is limited stuff. It's weak sauce consciousness that seems ultimate just because you know nothing higher.
</p>

<p>
	If you are incarnated as a living being, you are finite. And no amount of fancy talk about how present you are will change that.
</p>

<p>
	On your state of consciousness hinges everything. Don't go thinking you are above states. You ain't. You are stuck in a state at all times. An extremely limited state.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully awoke, you would cease to exist in that body. The only reason you are here is because you don't want to be fully awake. Otherwise you'd be Infinity. And no, you are not Infinity, even though you are Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	You must do a provocation test by consuming a proper amount of DMSA and ALA during the test. This will give you some idea of how much you are excreting.

<p>
	Not a week straight but 3 days, yes.
</p>

<p>
	Yes it could take a year or two to fully detox depending on how severe your toxicity is. But you can feel improvements much sooner than that.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel improvements then it'a worth it.

<p>
	4-AcO-DMT is no joke. It is one of the most serious mindfucks I ever got.
</p>

<p>
	Try plugging it. You will probably get an even deeper mindfuck as it seems to metabolize differently when consumed orally.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging ensures that you stomach does not break it down into some common mushroom precursor.

	Consider the possibility, though, that she was actually helping black and brown people by pretending to be one.
</p>

<p>
	Her problem was that she cared so much it backfired.

<p>
	It's better to be a fake black person fighting for BLM vs a republican who's in denial about systemic racism. Which is why excessive Green is still better than excessive Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Being a fake black person hurts very few people compared to other ways one could be. Even if you steal 1 professorship, that's still peanuts compared to how much good you could be doing in other ways.

<p>
	Start to notice how often people do it, and how often you do throughout your own life.
</p>

<p>
