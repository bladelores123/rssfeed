<p>
	Nothing. It just takes some courage and confidence in yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't muster the courage to even walk up and introduce yourself, why on earth would she ever let you inside her legs? A weak guy like you doesn't deserve a hot girl.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to become a strong guy. Strong guys get hot girls.
</p>

<p>
	When you want something in life, you have to be willing to work your ass off for it. Amazing shit is not just gonna land in your lap. You must BUILD what you want. Do you want to be a strong guy? Then BUILD it! Don't ask "But how?" Just get started.

<p>
	There too many ways to list them all:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Grooming better
	</li>
	<li>
		Dressing better
	</li>
	<li>
		Having a strong sense of life purpose and direction
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing charisma
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing humor
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing confidence, leadership skills, speaking skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Earning money, becoming successful, reputable, famous
	</li>
	<li>
		Building a social circle of cool and positive friends
	</li>
	<li>
		Being more social
	</li>
	<li>
		Gaining experience with women
	</li>
	<li>
		Doing pickup & cold approach
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing flirting skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving your vocal tone and body posture
	</li>
	<li>
		Going to the gym and shaping up your body
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving your diet
	</li>
	<li>
		Building an amazing life for yourself
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing amazing sexual skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing emotional connection and your feminine side
	</li>
	<li>
		Meditation & consciousness work
	</li>
	<li>
		Self-love and self-acceptance
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing misc skills such at: cooking, home repair, home defense, sewing, arts & crafts, martial arts, yoga, photography, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Becoming a good human being
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving your communication skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving your relationship skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Learning, reading, knowledge
	</li>
	<li>
		Building an awesome bachelor pad/home that will make a girl wet just from walking in
	</li>
	<li>
		Traveling around the world
	</li>
	<li>
		And more...
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You could invest 10 years of full time work developing all that.
</p>

<p>
	None of it is necessary to get laid, but all of it ups your value.
</p>

<p>
	Bottom line: become awesome, and awesome people will gravitate towards you. Or stay lame, and lame people will gravitate towards you. But don't expect to have awesome people in your life while you're lame and too lazy to change yourself. A lazy, sloppy, victim attitude instantly makes you repulsive, since you are a value-leech, expecting something for nothing. If you want something special you must be eager to work for it.

<p>
	Of course!
</p>

<p>
	You act like this is some special handicap unique to you.
</p>

<p>
	Literally EVERY guy struggles with this. Even experienced PUAs still get approach anxiety on their first few sets of the night. That's why warm up sets are so important, and building up state.
</p>

<p>
	You really need to watch some old school RSD videos circa 2012, where all this is explained and addressed.
</p>

<p>
	There is no trick to overcoming this problem. You must do hundred of approaches by facing your fears. You will realize all your fears are illusions. But no amount of logic will resolve this. Only approaching will.
</p>

<p>
	You overcome it by realizing you're being a pussy, and by forcing yourself to approach regardless of how you feel.

<title>The Allure Of Identity</title>

<p>
	If there are 70 different genders, you can certainly choose to be whatever race you want.
</p>

<p>
	In theory, there's no reason why a white person couldn't identify with being more black than white. Rapper like Eminem comes to mind. If a white guy grows up in the hood, immersed in black culture, then he's probably more black than white at the level of the mind.

	I've done over 100 trips and feel no brain damage. My brain is working just fine. Better even, thanks to increased awareness and understanding of things.

			But most people have predetermined value in this case. Like an attractive woman with good proportions has value that other women can't produce for themselves.

<p>
	No!

<p>
	You can significantly increase your value.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of value merely as looks.

<p>
	And if you just invest more time dressing better, with some style, you would look at least 2x hotter.

<p>
	Exactly. Tradeoffs.
</p>

<p>
	It is every girl's dream to catch a player and lock him down.
</p>

<p>
	Well, it's playing with fire. Maybe you can lock him down, maybe you can't. Depends on what you're offering.
</p>

<p>
	Dating is a sort of market auction system where buyers and sellers have to meet each other's value propositions.
</p>

<p>
	The better you make yourself the higher your bids can be. The key, as with other areas of life, is to bring massive value to the negotiating table. Then you can get what you want. But most people are too lazy to up their value. They want to leech value.

So if a guy seems too smooth to be true, how do you think he got that smooth?
</p>

<p>
	Non-player guys are gonna be more reserved, more shy, more awkward, slower, not as sexy or charming, not as charismatic, not as funny, more plain and boring.

<p>
	You're still super young and no one will care about your age. What employers care about is your demonstrable skill set and portfolio.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get hired as an artist, all you need is a great portfolio. You don't even need a degree and your age is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	All of your attention should be focused on building your skills and putting together a jaw-dropping portfolio.
</p>

<p>
	Artists get hired solely on their portfolios.

</p>

<p>
	Find what lights you up.
</p>

<p>
	A masters degree is not gonna guarantee you any jobs. To get good jobs you must build a solid portfolio and marketable skills. Not degrees.
</p>

<p>
	You can get a temporary job now while you figure out your true passions.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need an MA in economics to find a decent job.

<p>
	Living a life on purpose will make you more confident and stronger as man, which will make you more attractive.

<p>
	Being successful in your life purpose can make it much easier to meet new people through your reputation, status, expertise, celebrity, etc.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you are a semi-successful musician or actor or public speaker, it will be very easy to get laid simply because of how visible you are.
</p>

<p>
	How often you get laid is directly proportional to how many new people are seeing you.

<p>
	It is a fact that you can be more conscious than you currently are.
</p>

<p>
	End of story.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone is in the present moment, but that doesn't mean everyone is equally conscious of it.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sick of arguing against this neo-Advaita over-simplified shit which refuses to acknowledge differences in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you are surrendered to the present moment does not mean you are deeply conscious of anything.
</p>

<p>
	What I care about is CONSCIOUSNESS, not surrender and not liberation and not freedom from suffering and not lack of ego and not some permanent condition. But CONSCIOUSNESS!
</p>

<p>
	It makes no difference to me how long it lasts or what its consequences are.

<p>
	Not really. They tend to be anti-addictive.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, if you are irresponsible, anything can be psychologically addictive. But it is not physically addictive at all and it has no withdrawal.
</p>

<p>
	Don't do anything just because you hear me talking about it. You must feel compelled to do it of your own volition, not because someone tells you to.

<p>
	No, I'm just saying that you can hook a girl whilst being a deadbeat. This happens all the time because girls don't get attracted by your money or job, they get attracted to how much you emotionally stimulate them.
</p>

<p>
	You can emotionally stimulate a girl without a job, or whilst having an amazing job. Of course having an amazing job makes you more of a long-term catch and gives you even higher value. But you can still appear high value without a job at all if you're very charismatic, for example.

<p>
	Sounds like you're simply conscious of what God and Love are.
</p>

<p>
	God is everything that exists. Love is everything that exists.
</p>

<p>
	If it exists, it is God/Love. Hence rape is God/Love.
</p>

<p>
	Don't you find it odd that you believe that God created the universe, and yet you somehow think God didn't create rape???

<p>
	There are many degrees of infinity.
</p>

<p>
	And they are worth accessing.
</p>

<p>
	If you are interested in Consciousness, then reaching higher degrees of infinity is something you should be interested in.
</p>

<p>
	You can discover ever deeper layers to how reality is constructed. This is not just chasing states. This is profound, life-changing stuff. This is a pursuit for those who actually care to understand how reality works at the deepest levels.

<p>
	Liberation may be one thing, but understanding is something else.

	I bet that a lot of professional women in their 30's and 40's who work boring corporate jobs but make good salaries would kill to have a player boyfriend who fucks her real good and provides her an outlet to be playful and go on adventures.

<p>
	Girls just wanna have fun and feel their feminine side. Which the proper guy can do for her. That's when she falls hard in love, and he can then exploit her emotional soft spot for him.

<p>
	DARE program was not about educating truth about drugs. DARE was a program to demonize drugs and indocrinate abstinence.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between sex abstinence programs vs proper sex ed and handing out free condoms and free birth control and free STD tests. And actually teaching how to have high quality, deep sex.
</p>

<p>
	It is insane that we do not teach teens how to have high quality sex! Truly the Dark Ages.

<p>
	All identity is relative.
</p>

<p>
	But of course biology plays a huge role. You identify as human because of your biology. Although of course "human" is still a relative, imaginary, constructed identity.
</p>

<p>
	But it makes more sense for you to identify as human than as a kangroo.

<p>
	We have them. But all agreed upon rules will be challenged and questioned, which is what is happening.
</p>

<p>
	The fantasy is thinking that we can agree on some rules and that's the end of the story. All rules must evolve and all rules have exceptions.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to play the game of agreeing to some rules and then pretending that these rules were not merely an agreement but objective reality handed down by God.

But it's also not entirely right.
</p>

<p>
	I gurantee you are nowhere close to infinitely conscious. So this thing you call "enlightenment", or just being in the present moment, is limited stuff. It's weak sauce consciousness that seems ultimate just because you know nothing higher.
</p>

<p>
	If you are incarnated as a living being, you are finite. And no amount of fancy talk about how present you are will change that.
</p>

<p>
	On your state of consciousness hinges everything. Don't go thinking you are above states. You ain't. You are stuck in a state at all times. An extremely limited state.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully awoke, you would cease to exist in that body. The only reason you are here is because you don't want to be fully awake. Otherwise you'd be Infinity. And no, you are not Infinity, even though you are Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	You must do a provocation test by consuming a proper amount of DMSA and ALA during the test. This will give you some idea of how much you are excreting.

<p>
	Not a week straight but 3 days, yes.
</p>

<p>
	Yes it could take a year or two to fully detox depending on how severe your toxicity is. But you can feel improvements much sooner than that.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel improvements then it'a worth it.

<p>
	4-AcO-DMT is no joke. It is one of the most serious mindfucks I ever got.
</p>

<p>
	Try plugging it. You will probably get an even deeper mindfuck as it seems to metabolize differently when consumed orally.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging ensures that you stomach does not break it down into some common mushroom precursor.

<p>
	It's better to be a fake black person fighting for BLM vs a republican who's in denial about systemic racism. Which is why excessive Green is still better than excessive Blue.

	Being a fake black person hurts very few people compared to other ways one could be. Even if you steal 1 professorship, that's still peanuts compared to how much good you could be doing in other ways.

	Playing victim is a very popular ego defense strategy.
</p>

<p>
	Start to notice how often people do it, and how often you do throughout your own life.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	You are doing it right, but this is just the early phases of self-inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	For self-inquiry to get serious, now you have to keep focusing awareness on awareness itself while quieting the mind down so it just rests on the awareness of awareness without moving. And just sit like that for as long as you can.
</p>

<p>
	It takes lots of training. The "What am I?" question should become internalized, so to speak, such that it doesn't need to verbalized non-stop. You just sit in silence and focus the awareness of awareness.
</p>

<p>
	Or just take a psychedelic.
</p>

	The biggest thing money buys is not happiness, but freedom to not be someone else's bitch.
</p>

<p>
	Being someone else's bitch can make you very miserable.
</p>

<p>
	But once you stop being someone else's bitch, life will still be difficult and full of new challenges. Now you gotta grapple with the biggest challenge of all: not being your own bitch.

<p>
	This is a phony distinction. Whether a state "sticks" or doesn't is completely irrelevant from the POV of truth/reality. This is a criteria that you -- the ego-mind -- is placing upon the situation. Who says that a thing must be permanent for it to be valid or true? The mere fact that it can exist, even for 5 seconds, is enough. Nothing sticks forever. Even your so-called Buddha-level enlightenment will eventually be lost as God will fall asleep at some point after it awakens. Otherwise there wouldn't be any asleep people in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	And yes, some people do have "permanent" states which are very different than all the classical ones you know or could ever access via meditation. Your "permanent" state totally hinges on your neurology, genetics, and brain chemistry. If we tweak your brain to start pumping out new chemicals, you will be permanently living in a new reality. Well, as long as you're in that body.
</p>

<p>
	In the not too distant future we will have a Neurolink-like device which will be installed in your brain which will consistently pump out whatever cocktail of neurotransmitters you want, and you will be able to dial in your baseline state of consciousness to whatever you want. Such a device will be the most important and revolutionary technology that mankind has ever invented.
</p>

<p>
	That's only because you've talked with so few people about these issues.
</p>

<p>
	People with weird, non-classic nondual stages have no platform and no one listens to them, not even classically enlightened folk. So they are off quietly living in their own worlds while you are oblivious to their existence.

	Did you know that US law didn't recognize marital rape until the 1980s?
</p>

<p>
	Rape was literally defined as: "A man having forced sex with a woman who is not his wife."

<p>
	The relativity of language is certainly a big factor. But that's not what I'm pointing to here. I'm saying there is a vast diversity of conscious states underneath all the language difficulties, such that even if you hammer out all the language problems, you will still be left with a massive 3D terrain of diverse conscious states. And there no escape states. No matter how awake you are, you're still beholden to a state.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is so diverse than you cannot map it with a 1D or 2D model. Which is why the RASA 1000 LOC model is dumb. It's grossly reductionistic. You can't map consciousness on a 1D line or even a 2D plane.

<p>
	This is the problem with turning enlightenment into some binary thing.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "enlightenment" as a monolith. No two people have the same degree and kind of consciousness. Rather than thinking of enlightenment as a monolithic state, open your mind to the possibility that there are thousands of different states from which one can be awake. So the chances that any two people have the same degree and kind of awakening is tiny. Which is why all these nonduality debates keep happening. People assume enlightenment is a monolithic singular thing but it obviously is not if you bother to research it in some depth.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees and even different kinds of ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	You can have an ego-death so deep that you won't even be able to know your own first name. Yet most awake people can still recall their first name. That doesn't mean they aren't awake. It just means there are different kinds and degrees and states. To reduce and dismiss this vast diversity of awakening is very problematic and leads to much confusion and misunderstanding. It is a parallel problem to thinking that Christianity is the one true best religion because it happens to be the one you're familiar with. But there are many other religions which are equally valid, if not more so. But you have to be able to step outside your little self-constructed bubble in order to see it.
</p>

<p>
	People who speak of awakening/enlightenment as a singular thing have clearly not experienced anywhere near the range of consciousness that is possible. The chief characteristic of consciousness is its enormous diversity. Consciousness is infinitely diverse, beyond anything the default human mind-state can imagine. And even beyond what most enlightened humans can imagine. Just because you'd had some awakenings does not mean you understand how deep and diverse consciousness can be. No mater how awake you think you are, I guarantee you are underestimating what consciousness is capable of.
</p>

You can have awakenings and still be depressed as it takes time for the mind to integrate your new reality. The ego-mind is rarely wiped out in one fell swoop. It tends to stick around and do its egoy things.
</p>

<p>
	The early stage of realizing no-self can be especially bleak. Things brighten up once you get past that into God-realization.

<p>
	That simply means you've got more karma to burn through and lower Achiever stages to master. By all means, go for it.
</p>

<p>
	If spirituality seems like nonsense to you, then you simply aren't ready for it yet.

<p>
	Movies are designed for drama.
</p>

<p>
	There is never a movie in which everything goes well and everyone gets along. People pay to see people suffering through hell.
</p>

<p>
	When you are writing a story, as the writer, you deliberately add problems to characters where none existed.

<p>
	By definition, Infinite Love Forever cannot have any form or person there. It feels a lot like if you were physically merged with every living being in the universe to the point where all of you became an undifferentiated soup of Love. It's like entering a black hole of Love from which there is no desire to return. You give up the desire to have any concrete personhood or form so that you could merge for fully with every part of the universe.
</p>

<p>
	It's like having an infinitely long, infinite intensely orgasm that is so intense that it kills the body and just keeps going forever beyond the body because the body cannot contain so much Love. It is literally an Endless Ocean of Love in which all memory of having been a human or a person is lost. That is God in its purest form. But this degree of Love is not possible for humans because they choose to be finite and separate from things.

<p>
	It's crucial that you address those root issues. Modafinil can give you focus and a mood-boost but it cannot correct for metal toxicity if you got it.
</p>

<p>
	You can start doing heavy metal chelation without many tests, and just see if you feel better from it.

Unbelievable improvements, actually.
</p>

<p>
	And I am currently testing out new chelation protocols which might be a game-changer.
</p>

<p>
	I will share my discoveries at some point in the future, so stay tuned. This is amazing stuff.

</p>

<p>
	If you really want to go there permanently, just set that intention on your deathbed.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't be too much in a rush to get there. Enjoy the dream.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.
</p>

<p>
	And the grass is always greener on the other side. Once you're there, you'll want to be back here.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why you're here. To experience here. Don't take here for granted. Every corner of God is worthy of exploration.

<p>
	Your framing is wack here. You make it sound like God is a dude sitting up in the clouds clapping his hands as he observes rape.
</p>

<p>
	That's not what Love means here.
</p>

<p>
	Love is an infinite self-embrace. God loves rape because rape is an aspect of Infinity / Self. God's love of rape is simply God's love of itself. God IS rape. God IS Love.

<p>

<p>
	On DMT there is only me. No aliens, no angels, no others. And there is also nothing to heal.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, "healing" is part of the dream world. When you are infinitely conscious, nothing needs healing or changing.

<p>
	There are revolutionary times, but the bigger the leap forward, the bigger the ego backlash backward, so it's not necessarily a good strategy to aim for revolutions. Revolutions tend to be polarizing and they produce a lot of bluster without the solid infrastructure. I would prefer an approach that slowly builds solid infrastructure rather than just blusters.
</p>

<p>
	After the French Revolution came the counter-revolution and Napoleon. I think this is typical of how revolutions tends to unfold.

<p>
	It would be too shocking to publish. You guys would misunderstand it and think I am a deluded narcissist cult leader.
</p>

<p>
	Hence no manifesto for you.
</p>

<p>
	I don't place much stock any more in the awakenings of other teachers/humans. To me it is child's play stuff.

<p>
	I have seen things....

<title>Why is awakening so rare?</title>

<p>
	Most awakened people are too scared to do serious multiple doses of 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	I keep suggesting they do, and they keep chickening out.
</p>

<p>
	So fear and closedmindedness are huge factors.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are simply not interested in exploring consciousness to is highest levels. Even the "awake" of often uninterested.
</p>

<p>
	But also, 5-MeO-DMT is not a magic pill. It will not leave you in a permanent state of God-consciousness. You must still do the work.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is: You can't get something unless you REALLY want it. You have to want to become God.
</p>

<p>
	Of course healing is also something we want. You can have both. And sometimes you can't. There is never a guarantee of health. Health is an extremely complex issue involving thousands of subtle factors, most of which are out of your awareness and control.
</p>

<p>
	I can work on increasing my consciousness and improving my health at the same time. And the two synergize.

<p>
	Switching your identity to that of Nothingness to the exclusion of states and fields becomes its own subtle duality.
</p>

<p>
	If you identify with being an observer of the field, that is a subtle duality still. There is 1) YOU, and 2) the field.

<p>
	YOU = FIELD
</p>

<p>
	ONENESS

	Nothing more can be said.

<p>
	You can frame it that way if you want. There are various ways of framing it.
</p>

<p>
	I make no distinction between the field and Brahman, Self and no-self.
</p>

<p>
	In the end there is only ONENESS. Slice it up however you want. People will naturally slice it up in different ways, which will cause disagreements.
</p>

<p>
	But I sometimes notice that people dismiss the important of the transparency or opaqueness of the field. Which I think is a big disservice to students. The transparency/opaqueness matters a lot in practical terms. The point of all spiritual work is to increase transparency.

<p>
	No it isn't. It's still all one consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Light is not turned into two substances by increase or decrease of intensity.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be a stickler and insist on pure, absolute, unmitigated nonduality, then you can become the Godhead itself, which is just formless infinite consciousness which increases in intensity forever without end. But at this point your human life will be gone, as will the entire material universe.

		<p>
			How could an ant not be as conscious as I am?
		</p>

		<p>
			I mean, I get it, it doesn't perceive as "much" as I do, but that's not the point, consciousness is not perception in the ordinary sense. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<br />
			It is all one consciousness, the great all-pervasive, all-inclusive empty awareness, it is Nothingness, how could there possibly be "a different Nothingness" ? An ant has (is) the same consciousness, the same Nothingness as I am. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Having realized that you are that awareness (independent of whether you've realized it or not) , what is the point in pursuing "more"? What "more" is there supposed to be? (besides strengthening one's non-dual awareness in everyday life)
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Consciousness is an infinite field which is capable of being more or less conscious of itself, more or less transparent or opaque to itself. Similar to the light in empty space. You can have very little light or you can have our sun, or something that's 1 million times brighter than our sun. All of that is the same light, but many degrees of brightness.
</p>

<p>
	An ant is definitely not conscious that it is God.
</p>

<p>
	Children are definitely not conscious that they are God.
</p>

<p>
	99.9% of adults have no consciousness of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	But you could become God-conscious. This takes some doing. It isn't your natural state. Your natural state is a state of humanness.
</p>

<p>
	This infinite field of consciousness, because it is unlimited, is capable of dialing itself down from infinity to some finite consciousness, like that of a rock. When God is dialed down to a rock, God isn't aware that it is God.
</p>

<p>
	I have seen so called "enlightened" people take 5-MeO-DMT and DMT, and it simply failed to take effect or they refused to do higher doses because they were too scared.
</p>

<p>
	It's not because they are so woke that it doesn't work on them. They simply have little desire to actually take serious doses repeatedly. They do a little test dose and then stop right there, thinking they understand what 5-MeO-DMT or DMT can offer.
</p>

<p>
	And also, these chemicals do not work on all people. Some people are simply immune. Some people simply have bad bodily reactions with no significant shift in consciousness. So when some enlightened "gym rat" tells you he's done psychedelics, it doesn't mean shit. "I've done psychedelics" is like saying "I've done math" when you have only done 1st grade arithmetic. There are many degrees of "Doing math".

<p>
	No it isn't.
</p>

<p>
	If this were true, everyone would be equally conscious and there would no point in spiritual practice. An ant would be as conscious as a human, and a child as an adult. Which is clearly not the case.
</p>

<p>
	To me, just hearing people claim that they are currently infinitely conscious is laughable. It's clear they are not even 1% conscious as they say that.
</p>

<p>
	If it seems to you like you're infinitely conscious, that's only because you're 1% conscious but have never experienced anything above that, so to you it like that you've already arrived. But in all honestly, you haven't even left the starting gate.
</p>

<p>
	You can decriminalize them all but then tightly regulate access.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously something like Fentinyl requires serious regulation, just like cyanide.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics also require reasonable regulation as people will abuse them. Low cost training programs are necessary that teach people how to do them safely and which unsafe ones to avoid.

	Yes, you can and basically should DIY chelation, since virtually no doctor knows how to do it for you. Only you can do it effectively yourself.

<p>
	Of course enlightenment is the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	But also, there's more.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a binary. To not acknowledge degrees of wokeness is amateur stuff. And to boil enlightenment down merely to presence does a disservice to how deep consciousness can go.
</p>

<p>
	You are nowhere near infinitely conscious this present moment. But you could be.
</p>

<p>
	Infininte consciousness always occurs in the present moment, but that does not mean the present moment is infinitely conscious.
</p>

<p>
	And "guru"? Guru just means: one who guides people from darkness to the light. It's become hip to use this term derisively, as if there's something wrong in guru-ing.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I don't claim to be enlightened is because I see now that there are infinite degrees of consciousness such that you could never boil them down to a simple binary on/off, enlightened/unenlightened. The question isn't, is person X enlightened? The real question is, how conscious is person X and what exactly is X conscious of?

</p>

<p>
	The word has been seriously diluted by those who have no idea what awakening is.
</p>

<p>
	Transitioning from Orange or Green is nice, but it has little to do with awakening.
</p>

<p>
	To awaken is to realize you are God.
</p>

<p>
	There will not be any significant percentage of God-realized people walking this planet in our lifetime.

<p>
	I don't agree with that. I don't see evidence we are going backwards.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that going forwards is never a straight line. It's always been 2 steps forward, 1 step back.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of smooth-brained folks interpret the 1 step back as the end of the world, when really it's all part of going forward.
</p>

<p>
	Forward is a counter-intuitive thing.

<p>
	That's a hallmark of conservative ideology. Its always got a romanticized view of history. The past is always mythologized and whitewashed in grossly unrealistic and ahistorical ways. Conservatism is inherently ahistorical.
</p>

<p>
	As if 1980's, or 1970's, or 1960's, or 1950's America was ever so great. It never was. There were riots and protests and murders and wars in all those eras. And all the laws were far inferior to what they are today. But conservatives love to tell themselves that those were the good ol' days -- when lynching a blackie for looking at a white woman wasn't even considered a crime by the local sheriff.

<p>
	I was strictly a designer. Although when I worked on my own projects I would do art and coding as well.
</p>

<p>
	CD Projekt Red actually emailed me about 8 years ago asking me to join them on Witcher 3's development. But I said no because I was starting Actualized. If I had said yes, I would probably be working on Cyberpunk right now. But I have zero interest in working for anyone but myself, and certainly not in the giant meatgrinder of AAA development.

<p>
	Basically yes, although there was still content in my experience, but it was made irrelevant by my overwhelming concentration on pure Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	And moreover, all content IS Nothing.
</p>

<p>
	There really is no difference between content and no content.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want a pure no-content experience, that's certainly possible. It's not strictly necessary, but possible. You can become pure Consciousness with no content. This is a specific type of samadhi.

<title>Is &quot;The Great Awakening&quot; Real?</title>

<p>
	Nah.... I don't buy it.
</p>

<p>
	There is a Green awakening happening, and a huge backlash to that. But there is no Turquoise level awakening happening. Less than 0.1% of the world is at the Unitive stage of ego development and I don't see that number shifting significantly in our lifetimes.
</p>

<p>
	There will be a big Green awakening over our lifetimes though as stage Blue and Orange become increasingly morally bankrupt and outdated.
</p>

<p>
	The number of people actually grasping nonduality is pitifully low, and that will not change without better government infrastructure, massive education reform, serious redistribution of wealth, and some kind of serious checks on capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that most of the planet is stuck in stage Blue, fighting tooth and nail to get to Orange. And it will be that way for decades to come.
</p>

<p>
	I bet it will probably get a 9/10 or 10/10 rating and sell something like 30+ million copies. Unless it turns out to be turd.
</p>

<p>
	I think they've been developing it so long because they know if they can hit a 9/10 rating they will earn a billion dollars off this title. So it's really in their benefit to make it good.
</p>

<p>
	If it matches the quality of Witch 3, they will earn a billion dollars.

Their top talent will burn out and leave and CD Projekt Red will turn into EA, Blizzard, Bethesda, Bioware. That's what always happens. The more success they get, the more money they earn, the bigger their hits, the more corrupt and heartless they become.
</p>

<p>
	Once you reach that level of success and size, it all becomes a corporate machine and it will never be about the art.
</p>

<p>
	AAA game development is basically unsustainable from a creative/artistic POV. It's fucking meatgrinder.

I suppose you can argue that doing pickup is an investment into yourself, but I imagine if you are really serious about it it can get really expensive. Especially if you live in LV, go out every weekend, probably end up buying some girls drinks, taking some girls out on dates. I mean jeez, that can add up quick. 
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Actually, Vegas is a super affordable place to live. If you are a local here, every club has free entry for locals on Sundays-Thursdays. Parking used to be free, now it's like $10. Drinks are $18 here, but I have never bought a girl a drink in my life and have no intention of starting. Dates can be super cheap. A date for me is a $5 coffee or ice cream.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to hit up the hottest clubs in the world on Fri/Sat, that will cost you $40/night. But the clubs in Vegas are off the hook amazing. You've never seen so many hot girls in your life. $40/night is worth it if you're serious about developing your skills and you have a decent salary.
</p>

<p>
	If you are clever, you can do pickup very cheap or even free. Depends a lot on location. Drinks in Austin, TX are like $3 and none of the bars have cover. Over my entire time in pickup I spent little money. Most of my money was spent simply on traveling to the best cities. And once I paid $2000 for a bootcamp.

			I feel like if you have already achieved financial freedom and are comfortable in life, then it could be worth it. I would love to spend some time trying to get better with girls but I'm so occupied trying to figure out what in hell I'm going to do to avoid the dreaded 9-5 and spending lots of time reading, watching videos, and thinking. Maybe that's just an excuse. It's definitely a department I need to work on, but just not a priority at the moment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You don't need total financial freedom to do pickup. Most of the guys who I met in pickup were not financially free. They had normal 9-5 jobs and gamed at night or on the weekends.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest challenge is not money, it's time and energy. Pickup eats up a ton of time and energy. But still guys are able to do it while holding down regular jobs. I have met accountants, pilots, engineers, doctors, dentists, salesmen, etc. who did serious pickup.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I took a lot of time off work/biz to invest into pickup, and it was worth it. Of course I could only do that because I already was financially independent. But don't let this be a limiting belief. You don't have to be. But also, why not do both?!

<p>
	Well, of course Trump is an elite, but his supporters are too dumb to see that.

<p>
	Of course there is no elite conspiracy. Elites are just wealthy and powerful people acting out their self-agenda, as all people are. And they often have different agendas. Elites fight with elites all the time.

<p>
	"War criminal" is a dumb label. It is meaningless when applied to presidents and heads of state. Leaders of giant countries and militaries are forced to make combat decisions that involve the loss of thousands of lives. It is part of their job description.

	See, this is why such a label is dumb. You use it to create a gross false equivalency.

<p>
	It's like saying, "What's the difference between going bowling with my next door neighbor, Jim, who kills chickens to feed his family, and going bowling with Charles Manson? They're both killers. So I'll just go with Manson since he's already in the car and ready to drive."
</p>

<p>
	You lack imagination to see just how dangerous Trump's decisions can be if he was presented with a serious military emergency. It's very much possible that Trump's idiocy and narcissism could kill 1 million or 10 million lives.

<p>
	As the propaganda and culture war against stage Green heats up, people get polarized and are forced to take sides. Thus people like Hulse take the side of Blue/Orange vs Green in the culture wars, which can seem like regression (or it may be actual regression as their minds are slowly rotted away by right-wing propaganda).
</p>

<p>
	As the center of gravity of American culture shifts to solid Green, many people will dig in their heels and refuse to budge. Even going so far as the pull hard in the opposite direction to the "good old days" they remember.

<p>
	By definition if you are regressing down one stage, it's unconscious. Regression IS a lapse in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	People are not choosing these things. These "choices" are simply baked into their habitual low-consciousness behaviors.

			The influential historian, who specialized in American history, and social critic, the late <strong>Christopher Lasch</strong>, in his 1996. posthumously published book ,,<strong>The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy</strong>'' wrote that there was a new elite emerging in American society in the 1980's and 1990's in American society, that Trump given his familial background and livelihood revenues was a part of and still is,<em> that was so detached in the way's they earn their income, in which social circles they move and interact with and in where they live and how they live from ordinary Americans</em> <u>that Lasch called them the</u> <strong>cerebral aristocracy</strong> <u><em>of the contemporary globalized world</em> </u>and <strong>wrote</strong> <em>how they live lives so detached from regular people who live in the same country as them, that they interact and socialize only, on a deeper level, with the members of the same group as them and with international elite in other countries in limited geographical pockets and exclusive social events, that they have become so detached and wilfully oblivious to the national decay and collapse taking place in their own countries, and have at this point internalized in them as part of a normal course of happenings within the country they inhabit, there are bad times and there are good times, while not being affected it by it all themselves</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Quotes from the book:
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, The child of a materially wealthy civilization, like a child of any nouveau riche, is almost always spoilt, immodest and shameless.''</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, Their motto maximum pleasure, minimum responsibility, has brought about a demographic decline of the countries they live in.''</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, Patriotism, certainly does not accompany a high position on the scale of their values and virtues. So the following question is asked: Do they even consider themselves as other Americans, deep down? "</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, They are not on the side of their own societies, since they  fundamentally don't know it, they are on the side of global structures and cliques, in which circles they spend most of their active lives."</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			I think this a good description<em> from what part American society Trump comes from</em>, <em>about what shaped his character </em>and <em>view of other people that are not a part of the same class in society as he is</em>.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	You have to be careful when framing global worldviews as some sort of evil.
</p>

<p>
	The above things you quoted are a basic trend of moving from stage Blue or Orange to Green. You develop a more global perspective.
</p>

<p>
	But that isn't even Trump's problem. Trump's problem is far below that of being some neoliberal elite. It's too heartless, narcissistic, and ignorant to be an effective neoliberal globalist type.

	Trump wasn't some hippie contentious objector. He was just too selfish to service his country.
</p>

<p>
	Shunyamurti was draft dodger. But there is a big difference between saying, "I will not fight an unjust war and protest against it's injustice" vs "I don't want to fight this war because I would rather have sex at nightclubs and make money back home".
</p>

<p>
	I can't believe I have to spell this out to you.

<p>
	Existence itself is formlessness. It is definitely possible to have pure empty existence minus any forms.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing (as we use it on this forum) is not a concept, it is a direct consciousness of one's true nature.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever awakening you've had, is good. But you also have much deeper to go, so don't stop inquiring.

<p>
	No. All experiences are enlightenment once you simply realize there was no one ever behind them.
</p>

<p>
	Experience isn't the problem, the only problem is that self-image which keeps feeding itself, telling itself that there is someone to whom the experiences are happening to.

	Experience does not happen to anyone.

<p>
	You can become conscious of Absolute Truth. This is quite an achievement. But Absolute Truth is not anywhere elsewhere but here and now. Just remove the ego sense and all will be revealed as Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not merely another experience, it's a meta thing in which you realize the true nature of all experiences.

<p>
	You can talk to them and get a feel for their worldviews.
</p>

<p>
	I've hung out with and listened to a lot of guys in the pickup community. They tend to treat rape as a joke. Some of them are actual rapists. When speaking with such guys, they clearly don't think of rape as anything wrong or harmful.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of immature guys tend to think of rape like this:
</p>

<p>
	"Well, if I got raped by a hot girl, that would be cool and I would be happy, therefore, rape isn't a big deal. Those feminist/SJW types are just making a big deal out of nothing. Besides, girls are sluts and whores anyway, so what difference does it make?"
</p>

<p>
	It's a very self-centered view of sex. Women are simply seen as convenient objects to satisfy one's own sexual needs, and then discarded. The belief is, they are all sluts anyway, so they lose nothing and they aren't really hurt.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps a common mark of toxic masculinity ideology is that it interprets the term "toxic masculinity" as meaning: all masculinity is toxic. But to say that some forms of masculinity are toxic does not mean there isn't healthy masculinity.

<p>
	Not it isn't.
</p>

<p>
	If you take a moment to contemplate this, you'll realize that "harm" is a purely relative notion. "Harm" is always defined relative to some ego's needs and desires, which are themselves relative and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	Harm is a relative, subjective, biased, egoic notion.
</p>

<p>
	YOU think rape is harmful. A rapist certainly doesn't think that. And your view has no higher epistemic position than that of a rapist in the absolute sense.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of men genuinely believe that rape is not harmful. And that is true from the POV.

<p>
	It's simple, really: pursuing women can be turned into a larger healthy self-actualization journey or it can devolve into ideology, toxic masculinity, ego-aggrandizement, and mindless pleasure seeking.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to business. Similar to psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	These things can go really well or really sour depending on what intentions you're doing them with.
</p>

<p>
	For me, pickup led to the creation of Actualized.org. For other guys it can lead to rapey type of behavior. Pickup very much magnifies your true intentions and character. If you're a scummy guy deep down, then pickup will magnify that. Much like how if you give a evil person a $10 million dollars, he will use it to do evil things. But if you give a good guy $10 million dollars, he will use it to advance mankind in some way.

<p>
	Nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	What the 2016 election clearly showed is that no elites are controlling the winners, since all the elites hated Trump and thought he would never win. Even Trump didn't think he would win!
</p>

<p>
	The elites have no idea who will win, which is why they bribe and lobby both sides, and they befriend whichever side holds power.
</p>

<p>
	Nobody is in control of the system because everyone is part of the system, including you.

<p>
	It's quite silly to blame the US police system on Biden. This system is so huge it is outside of any one politician's control. The 90's was a different time. Everyone was into strong policing back then. You cannot retroactively project 2020 standards on 90's politics.

<p>
	Because he's much better than Trump.

	If you are truly concerned about the raping of America, Biden is much better than Trump. Fascists will rape the country much worse than Neoliberals ever will, despite what progressives will have you believe.

<p>
	I would make the opposite point. The chances now are better than ever of a new Obama or Clinton -like, but progressive, leader to emerge. I think we'll see exactly that in the next 8 to 16 years. It will happen regardless of whether Trump wins or Biden wins. In both cases people are going to see that neither conservativism nor neoliberalism are working. And they will be eager for something new. Someone like Bernie but with a younger, more charismatic face, and a fighter.
</p>

<p>
	The function of Bernie was not to win the Presidency. The function of Bernie was to pave the way for a new, younger, charismatic progressive leader in the next 5 to 20 years.

<p>
	Again, you say this while Trump and Republicans are in power. It's an absurd double-standard.

<p>

<p>
	You might as well vote for Donald Duck.
</p>

<p>
	Co-opting the Dem party is the way to go. As AOC and the Justice Dems are doing.
</p>

<p>
	Trump too co-opted the Republican party.
</p>

<p>
	In both cases, the game consists of shifting the two mainstream parties either more left or more right. That's the whole game. Take responsibility for it. You can't be in politics while avoiding this game.
</p>

<p>
	By rejecting the game you automatically lose it.
</p>

<p>
	There is never going to be some magical "good" 3rd party which is above the fray. Such a party will never get mainstream appeal. The parties have to be dumbed down and play to the lowest common denominator so long as people are in Tier 1 stages of cognitive development. And a Tier 2 party will never win.
</p>

<p>
	At least in our lifetime. Maybe in 100 years this will start to change.
</p>

<p>
	It's flawed if you take it literally as you must be 50/50. It's wise if you understand the larger point he's trying to make.

<p>
	Sadhguru is not saying something as stupid as: for every one day you wear a suit, the next day you must wear a skirt.
</p>

<p>
	Stop taking the words of spiritual teachers literally. There is always a deeper, higher meaning behind their words.

			Yes, but only everything that actually exists.

		<p>
			Marlon Brando is not actually The Godfather. It's just Marlon Brando. There's no duality there, only Brando exists. Godfather is just Brando pretending. That doesn't validate the existence of The Godfather one iota, and it's not a duality or distinction that needs "collapsing" or reconciling one way or another. There never was a godfather, it was always just Marlon Brando pretending. Godfather is pure fabrication.
		</p>

		<p>
			The movie on a videotape is just videotape. There is no movie other than the videotape. No duality, no need to reconcile them. The videotape exists, the movie doesn't, except as a facade of the videotape. The movie is pure fabrication, can't possibly exist in its own right, and is thereby proof of the videotape even if nobody in the movie ever "experienced" the video tape. Nonduality refers to the videotape, not the movie. At most you could say that the movie is an expression of the videotape, and as such included in the nondual nature of the videotape.
		</p>

		<p>
			If appearance is anything, it's consciousness pretending. Sort of. Form is formless pretending. They are not identical in truth, one is a facade of the other, and only the other exists so no need to reconcile them. Relativity is the absolute pretending. Still no duality, still no actual relativity. It was always just the absolute pretending. Sort of. The absolute never actually does anything, it just imagines to be doing everything. Still no duality, still no need to reconcile.
		</p>

		<p>
			Only the absolute exists, relativity never did. Reality is not a strange loop, it only appears as a strange loop. Strange loop is the facade.
		</p>

		<p>
			Infinite regression is not the same as actual infinity. The former can't exist, the latter must exist. A strange loop is infinite regression. Relativity is infinite regression. Two hands drawing eachother is infinite regression. Escher's stairs are infinite regression. Duality is infinite regression. Infinite regression is not absolute, it is impossible. Infinity is absolute and necessary.
		</p>

		<p>
			Come on it's not that difficult...  😕

<p>
	No, you are still creating duality by trying to negate appearances. Appearances are absolute. If you don't get that, you ain't really awake.
</p>

<p>
	That itch on your ass -- yup, it's absolute.

	In my experience most guys who I met who are into pickup are more developed than the average person. Because pickup is emotionally difficult, those who are moderately successful at it tend to take personal development seriously.
</p>

<p>
	There tends to be a big difference between guys who keyboard jockey about pickup online, and those who actually go out every night consistently.

<p>
	How does the universe know that something is wrong? By who's standards?
</p>

<p>
	The universe cannot even know which way is up or down, never mind right or wrong.

<p>
	Here's a pretty good analysis of how this might work.
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8aU8f528OY?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Although I highly doubt Biden can win Texas. That is not good assumption at all.

<p>
	Here's an interactive map you can use to make your 2020 election predictions:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.270towin.com/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.270towin.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Here are my two predictions as of Sept 1.
</p>

<p>
	Scenario #1: Biden barely squeaks out a victory, like so:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.270towin.com/maps/3XGAN" rel="external nofollow">https://www.270towin.com/maps/3XGAN</a>
</p>

<p>
	Scenario #2: Biden wins solidly if he carries Florida, like so:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.270towin.com/maps/KQVKm" rel="external nofollow">https://www.270towin.com/maps/KQVKm</a>
</p>

<p>
	I would bet more on scenario #1. Florida is not to be trusted.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Here are the most important swing state poll results:
</p>

<p>
	Wisconsin: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/wisconsin/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/wisconsin/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Ohio: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/ohio/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/ohio/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Michigan: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/michigan/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/michigan/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Georgia: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/georgia/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/georgia/</a>

<p>
	Arizona: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/arizona/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/arizona/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Florida: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/florida/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/florida/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Iowa: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/iowa/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/iowa/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Minnesota: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/minnesota/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/minnesota/</a>
</p>

<p>
	North Carolina: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/north-carolina/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/north-carolina/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Pennsylvania: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/pennsylvania/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/pennsylvania/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Texas: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/texas/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/texas/</a>
</p>

<p>
	I think Trump will win Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, and Georgia.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Make your own map and post the link here with your reasoning.

	But the ego's perspective can be expanded to God's perspective.

<p>
	Again, it's not about the actual sex, but about learning the skills to be a strong, attractive man. Those skills actually do create lasting fulfillment.
</p>

<p>
	And the sex doesn't have to be low quality. You will find cool girls and they can become your girlfriend which can grow into deep amazing sex.

	We need to coin a new term: Meta-cringe -- when you cringe at the ignorance displayed by others cringing at stuff because they think it is ignorant, AND at the same time you are fully conscious that your own cringe at their cringe is also ignorance on a higher level. <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<p>
	You don't need to be a some enlightened genius to understand this. You can get this right now.
</p>

<p>
	Let's say you just had a baby and I presented you with a button to push. If you push this button, the baby will never experience fear or pain in its life. Would you push this button?
</p>

<p>
	Well, if you do, your baby will be dead within 1 year as it breaks it skull on something.
</p>

<p>
	How do you expect survival to happen if fear and pain aren't present?
</p>

<p>
	If you want an organism to stay alive for 80 years, you better program it with many fears and pains.

<p>
	If you read the comments section under my video: The Dark Side Of Mediation, you'll see a lot of ignorant people, many of them Christians, taking my points as reasons why meditation is evil or demonic.
</p>

<p>
	People have this naive notion that if meditation isn't easy, pleasant, and instantly positive, or if it creates emotional purging, then it must be evil. When in fact those negative symptoms are simply the process of the devil leaving your body. As always, the devil calls what is good, evil, and what is evil, good.
</p>

	Only from the ego's perspective.

	The Earth is 4 billion years old.

<p>
	Once you take that into account, we are making progress at warp speed.

<p>
	Perspective is everything.

	Stay humble, grasshopper. Your mind keeps creating dualities.

<p>
	There is value in the alpha/beta distinction in the sense that you can turn yourself into a much stronger man. Not physically stronger per se, but spiritually stronger.
</p>

<p>
	You can become a lion among men. Which is a good thing. But it must be genuine strength rooted in consciousness and Love, not some frat-boy machismo which is compensating for insecurity, fear, and lack of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Teaching men how to be strong is a great and important teaching. You just have to be careful not to turn it into toxic masculinity, which is all too easy.
</p>
