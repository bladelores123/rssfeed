<title>Three Card Tarot Readings (Non-Psychic)</title>

<p>
	Guys, watch how easily you are willing to surrender your authority and responsibility for self-reflection to someone else.
</p>

<p>
	If you're serious about growing up, ponder whether doing so is a good idea.
</p>

<p>
	No disrespect to Emerald. But this can turn into a disservice for people. You must learn to stand up on your own two feet rather than asking an online stranger what your life purpose should be, etc.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know any of this is correct? Are you willing to stake your life on it?
</p>

<p>
	If you're just doing this to have fun, okay. But some people here look way too eager to have a stranger give them marching orders for life, which is not in the spirit of self-actualization. It is critical that you learn to listen to your heart and trust yourself more than any Tarot card.
</p>

<p>
	God is speaking through your heart. Why the fuck aren't you listening?
</p>

<p>
	No, I had zero intention of leaving. But then I stumbled my way into a level of consciousness so high that it seemed like to go any higher it would be a point of no return. Once you go that high there might be no coming back.

	If you transcend all differences, none of those physical difference would exist. So it would be irrelevant.

	There is no difference between a vagina and a roll of toilet paper. Only does the ego-mind imagine a difference.

<p>
	Yes, it's a serious problem.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not well versed in it. If you want to cure it, buy all the books on it you can and do all the research and then start testing various solutions until something sticks.

<title>Perusing enlightenment at 19?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Pretty much everyone needs those things unless you are going to become a full-time monk.
</p>

<p>
	So it's a question of whether you want to be a householder or a monk. There's no right answer. It's all about what you want.
</p>

<p>
	At an age so young, you've got plenty of time to build up a decent life for yourself (over the next 10 years let's say) and then you can abandon it later if you want to go hardcore monk. Or you can have that householder life established and waiting for you after you return from your spiritual quest.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming a monk at 19 is too extreme for most people. That would only be if you know for sure that your destiny is to be a full-time hardcore Buddha. But it even took The Buddha til 27 to leave his household and till 30-something to reach enlightenment.

</p>

<p>
	Seems hard to deny that.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying you should do it. Just saying it's a possibility.
</p>

<p>
	I would not be talking about it unless I had been thrust into it, and had to seriously evaluate where this is a place I want to go. Not a thing you want to stumble into by accident.

<p>
	The problem with mahasamadhi is that it doesn't really lend itself to documentation. If you're doing it, you will not give a damn about this world. You are basically choosing to destroy the dream world in favor of pure Infinity. So there will be no one to benefit from your documentation. Not to mention it's hard to post a video of yourself killing yourself. YouTube would shut it down.

Only upon death can such things happen by guru's grace because there is a gap of limbo state and you can be dissolved in that moment. Sadhguru talks about it somewhere.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here also:
		</p>

		<p>
			#Suffering will not seek Mukti - Sadhguru. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Also like pluto sayed. You can achieve mahasamadhi without meditation even. Sadhguru's wife did it with 9months of practice without having any previous experience of meditation
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I think I reached a point with 5-MeO-DMT in which a mahasamadhi might be possible -- if one really wanted to push for it.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is unproven.
</p>

<p>
	It took me about 80 trips. The mind becomes so indifferent to all differences that it seems to mirror Sadhguru's descriptions of what mahasamadhi requires: a totally equanimus mind which does not differentiate between anything and does not want to differentiate between anything. This is Love in its purest form.

<p>
	Maybe, but that's not what I understand currently. I understand it to be permanent pure Infinity/Love, and that's the end. The dream world is transcended and realized to never have existed.
</p>

<p>
	The way to escape the dream world is to realize that its only function was to teach you that reality is LOVE. Once this is fully recognized, that's it! The function of the dream world has been achieved. It was only a staging ground for the ultimate self-realization. Everything is Absolute Infinity. Period. This level of consciousness gives you complete omniscience. At which point you know yourself so completely that you are done. There cannot be anything more. You are Totally ONE, forever.

<p>
	About Sadhguru, I will say this. After studying him a bit closer, and in light of my recent awakenings, I think he's more awake than I originally thought. I think he's a masterful teacher and yogi.
</p>

<p>
	Given the tricky business of trying to guess another teachers' degree of awakeness, I will refrain from making definitive statements and instead just caution you guys not to take it for granted that your favorite teacher/guru is at the highest level. Be skeptical, but also open-minded and fair -- and acknowledge excellence where you see it.
</p>

<p>
	There is much valuable stuff you can learn from Sadhguru. I would not want to denigrate his work. But also keep in mind that there may be higher levels. How would you know? You see? That's the key point. The trick is to learn from teachers without getting stuck with their limits. Of course this applies to me as well.
</p>

	That would be the point of becoming a Bodhisattva.

<p>
	It does feel pretty selfish to just leave everyone behind without helping them.
</p>

<p>
	I think most of you guys should stay away from Mahasamadhi. Don't even think about it. It's only a thing the most radical spiritual seekers should consider when they reach that level. Most people just want some basic satori or God-realization and embodiment.

<p>
	That's the thing. Once you become conscious enough, teaching people becomes pointless since they are just you.

<p>
	With Mahasamadhi you stop imagining people who need teaching.

<p>
	By definition Mahasamadhi means your body drops dead at the moment of total realization.
</p>

<p>
	Technically speaking though, your body does not drop dead. Rather, you become so Conscious that you realize that your body and world never even existed. And finally you decide to stop imagining them. And so everything ends. This is DEATH.

<p>
	For me it is both. It helps a lot to do the same psychedelic over and over again. And it helps to do various ones at times, so that you get a better contrast and appreciation for their differences. It should all build on itself. At least it did for me.

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			How would that be different to the events that happened to Ramana, Eckhart, Sean Webb, Francis Lucille etc?  
		</p>

		<p>
			Take this excerpt from Francis Lucille for example:
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>I was sitting in silence, meditating in my living room with two friends. It was too early to fix dinner, our next activity. Having nothing to do, expecting nothing, I was available. My mind was free of dynamism, my body relaxed and sensitive, although I could feel some discomfort in my back and in my neck.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>After some time, one of my friends unexpectedly began to chant a traditional incantation in Sanskrit, the Gayatri Mantra. The sacred syllables entered mysteriously in resonance with my silent presence which seemed to become intensely alive. I felt a deep longing in me, but at the same time a resistance was preventing me from living the current situation to the fullest, from responding with all my being to this invitation from the now, and from merging with it. As the attraction toward the beauty heralded by the chant increased, so did the resistance, revealing itself as a growing fear that transformed into an intense terror.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>At this point, I felt that my death was imminent, and that this horrendous event would surely be triggered by any further letting go on my behalf, by any further welcoming of that beauty. I had reached a crucial point in my life. As a result of my spiritual search, the world and its objects had lost their attraction. I didn’t really expect anything substantial from them. I was exclusively in love with the Absolute, and this love gave me the boldness to jump into the great void of death, to die for the sake of that beauty, now so close, that beauty which was calling me beyond the Sanskrit words.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>As a result of this abandon, the intense terror which had been holding me instantaneously released its grip and changed into a flow of bodily sensations and thoughts which rapidly converged toward a single thought, the I-thought, just as the roots and the branches of a tree converge toward its single trunk. In an almost simultaneous apperception, the personal entity with which I was identifying revealed itself in its totality. I saw its superstructure, the thoughts originating from the I-concept and its infrastructure, the traces of my fears and desires at the physical level. Now the entire tree was contemplated by an impersonal eye, and both the superstructure of thoughts and the infrastructure of bodily sensations rapidly vanished, leaving the I-thought alone in the field of consciousness. For a few moments, the pure I-thought seemed to vacillate, just as the flame of an oil lamp running out of fuel, then vanished.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>At that precise moment, the immortal background of Presence revealed itself in all its splendor.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>-</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			So according to you this kind of ‘final’ awakening is just a joke, am I right? Sorry for hacking away at you with this but I have to in order to clarify things for myself.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not a joke. That's pretty good. Sounds like Nirvakalpa samadhi.
</p>

<p>
	To me though, that's still not God-realization and not Love-realization, so not the highest level.
</p>

<p>
	But find out for yourself. I'm just putting questions in your mind.

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	Life and reality both are imaginary. To become fully conscious is to exit the game of life entirely into eternal Love. Not for the faint of heart.

<p>
	I don't consider Ken Wilber Awake. Hard to explain why I know that.
</p>

<p>
	If you read Ken's memoirs, seems like he still suffers and deals with a lot of human BS.
</p>

<p>
	Part of the trick is how you define "suffering". People like to use different definitions.

<p>
	20, 40, 60, 100 trips, each one taking you deeper. Of course, these trips must be carefully spaced out so you have time to integrate the insights. Might take years.
</p>

<p>
	After 100 trips now, my depth of consciousness has become so profound that I fear if I take any more, I will simply leave my body into Infinity. It is nothing like what it was when I first began.

<p>
	Many ways brother. All the classical spiritual techniques are designed to aid in this.
</p>

<p>
	I have found 5-MeO-DMT to be the fastest and most effective. Your results may vary. Other psychedelics are also great. Use whatever is accessible.

<p>
	Or start a serious meditation or yoga practice.

<p>
	Awakening is Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is your destiny. Nothing occurs which isn't Love. Awakening is simply consciousness of that.
</p>

<p>
	When you see everything as Perfect, when you have surrendered completely to indiscriminate Love, what need is there to control things? Love flows. The only thing stopping it is fear. Fear of losing yourself. The more you lose yourself, the more Love just flows without manipulation or planning.
</p>

<p>
	If you were fully Awake you wouldn't want anything but the highest expression of Love. Which is precisely what you as God are always creating.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is Love. The end. Keep digging until you get it.

<p>
	The only way to reach the kind of thing you say, "Where any amount of pain can be thrown at you" is reach Infinite Consciousness and do a mahasamadhi. If you do this, the entire Universe will disappear, along with your body, into Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	No one alive has done this. But it is possible to do. This is more radical than shooting your children in the head. And no one here has the balls or understanding to do it.

<p>
	It's more a mix of psychedelic + dissociative. Not a deliriant and not poisonous as far as I know.

	You can reach any mind because all minds are you.
</p>

<p>
	Total Awakening is omniscient, which means you can access the mind of every being in the universe. You just have to realize that they are you.

When I have seen the simplicity of ‘getting’ there, when I have seen the light and that who I thought I am isn’t all that true after all, many interests suddenly just dropped away. All the ego games I’ve played don’t have anything to them anymore. All the distractions don’t have anything to them anymore. It feels like I’m still living in this old reality, but having seen it not to be true. Which feels pretty depressing.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Observation is important, but observation is toothless without questioning and seeking to understand.
</p>

<p>
	Words and logic is just a medium. It is a limited medium but we gotta start somewhere. You can get pretty far with some basic thinking and questioning.
</p>

<p>
	Like question, What is consciousness? That can take you far.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest answers will not be verbal or logical. But it's hard to reach there without verbal questioning and careful thinking.
</p>

<p>
	You are gonna be thinking regardless, so really this is a matter of how quality is your thinking.

	No, humans are not real things. So them dropping "dead" is not really death.

</p>

<p>
	This deconstruction is useful whether you want to use psychedelics or not. Even more fundamental than psychedelics is contemplation and deconstruction. The psychedelics are only lubricant for contemplation. The point of the videos is to provide a guide for deconstructing the mind and carefully questioning reality.
</p>

<p>
	You can question reality with or without psychedelics. Of course you'll get a lot further with them. But even without them it's still good.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you choose to meditate or do yoga, you will still need a hardcore questioning of reality. You can't just be a sheep and do practices without questioning.

<p>
	There exist thousands of different states of consciousness. Depresonalization disorder is one of those states, but it is NOT Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious that you are God? No? When you look at your body is it crystal clear that it is God? No? When you look at a lamp, is it cryatal clear that the lamp is God? No? Is it cryatal clear what the word "God" means? No? Is it crystal clear that birth and death are imaginary? No?
</p>

<p>
	Then you ain't Awake. You are in some other state.
</p>

<p>
	Any psychedelic will help you for starters. You got a long way to go till you can fully appreciate what 5-MeO has to show you.
</p>

<p>
	And even though meditation will not get you all the way to the top, it's still a good practice for you to you learn to focus your mind on the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	You can do any of the practices I've ever talked about. They are helpful.

<p>
	Truth is precisely what you see right now, minus your thoughts about it.

<p>
	There is no difference between a lamp and a human body. Both are just images on a screen.
</p>

<p>
	There are no "people". There are just some shapes which you say is a person. You might as well call a snowman a person.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at the world as if humans and animals never existed. But all shapes and colors are still the same as before. Just remove the humanness from it all.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine instead that you are the cosmos looking at itself.
</p>

<p>
	When you see a lamp, imagine that you are not looking at the lamp but that the lamp is seeing itself.
</p>

<p>
	The room you think you're in is actually self-seeing. Every object sees itself. And the net result is that it looks like this room "you see". You are the only thing which isn't real in the room.
</p>

<p>
	You are not in the room! There is just a room with objects in it like chairs and bodies.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	The purpose of it is to manipulate small parts of the dream to make yourself more comfortable in the dream.
</p>

<p>
	It's good for that.
</p>

<p>
	But it doesn't help you understand what reality is. Reality cannot be understood conceptually or with models.
</p>

<p>
	The epistemic value of QM is to show you that you cannot ever understand reality using science. You thought you could use science to get objective answers about reality, and QM showed that the only objective answer is that all scientific answers are necessarily relative and subjective.
</p>

<p>
	QM shows that you are chasing your own tail when you do science.
</p>

	Quantum mechanics is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine it right now. See?
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot notice right now that you are imagining quarks and Niels Bohr, nothing in the world can help you. You are lost in your mind and you lack the basic mindfulness skills needed to see it.
</p>

<p>
	You are inside a dream. Stop taking the contents of the dream seriously.

<p>
	Your personal desires are irrelevant when it comes to matters of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	You have to stop thinking about reality personally. It's not personal. Stop trying to get anything beneficial out of existence. Have the courage to be totally selfless.
</p>

<p>
	If you were totally selfless, it would not matter if you were sane or insane, alive or dead, healthy or sick, rich or poor, human or dog.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is selfless.
</p>

<p>
	When you are being selfish, you are being untruthful. You are falling into the illusion that one thing is better or worse than another. In Truth, there is no difference, no better, no worse. Being alive is not better than being dead. Being happy is not better than being in pain. That is Truth. But you don't want to accept it.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate freedom and joy is the realization that there is no difference between anything. This is what puts an end to struggle and suffering.
</p>

<p>
	So long as you believe that one thing is better than other, you will always suffer and struggle and be unhappy.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is the only salvation.

			For example, one thing that comes first to my mind is Sanity vs Insanity. Who would choose insanity over sanity?

<p>
	All difference is relative and imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	There is in fact no difference between a tomato and insanity. That difference is imaginary.

<p>
	You might have some underlying health issue. Maybe it's a disease or vitamin deficency, or mental health issue.
</p>

<p>
	I think you are getting ahead of your skiis. You need just basic self-help to ground yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Find a way not to hate your life before you go chasing enlightenment.
</p>

It seemed to suggest that God is learning with each new universe, so the current universe is not perfect. If god is absolutely unlimited in every way, why this learning process ? I am curious to know if you or anyone else has a take on this. (Probably worth a separate thread)
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	God is Absolute Perfection.
</p>

<p>
	It requires higher levels of Awakening to realize that.
</p>

<p>
	"imperfection" is a relative judgment made by a limited mind.
</p>

<p>
	If your mind became Infnite, you could not see imperfection. Because the Truth is you are Perfect.

	That cannot be told to you.

<p>
	Healing is not Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	There are many great healers in the world. That doesn't make them Awake.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sure Sadhguru has many amazing abilities and skills. But that's not what I'm talking about.

<p>
	You should not do psychedelics then. Your foundation is too weak so you are getting into abuse territory.
</p>

<p>
	You need more discipline.

<p>
	By this logic, why continue to live life? Why not kill yourself now? After all, when is enough enough?

<p>
	Haven't you had enough food? Enough sex? Enough of your family? Enough of nature? Enough of joy?
</p>

<p>
	So quit now. You've had enough. Don't waste any more time. You will die anyway, so might as well do it now.

<p>
	I guarantee you anyone you know who's so called "enlightened" will suffer if their health gets bad enough, and they will wish for their good health back.
</p>

<p>
	I have never claimed to be above suffering or health problems. This is a naive expectation.
</p>

<p>
	If I hit Sadhguru over the head with a hammer, his whole world will crash and he will struggle to do this job.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru in fact talks frankly about his serious past health problems.

			I have reservations with 5-MeO-DMT, not because of any dogma, but simply because it sounds too good to be true. From my limited experience, bigger prizes seem to require bigger efforts. Spiritual enlightenment is the ultimate prize, so it MUST require ultimate effort - years or decades of brutal practices. But Leo seems to have some strong convictions here, not sure what I'm missing.

<p>
	When people reason this way, the easiest way to hide the Truth becomes by making it too good to be true.
</p>

<p>
	Can you not see that your mind is using every trick possible to hide the Truth from you?
</p>

<p>
	Wherever you think the Truth cannot possibility be, that's precisely the best place to hide it.
