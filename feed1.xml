<p>
	That might be wise. Being limited to a university campus is not all that great.

<p>
	You can make an even bigger impact without all the institutional red tape and orthodoxy.
</p>

<p>
	No one is stopping you from changing the world but yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Also broaden your notion of what "science" is. Science is much bigger than what goes on in universities. The highest forms of science do not exist in universities at all! Universities are corporate machines.

<p>
	Actually you are NOT free to die, since God cannot die. That's the only thing you cannot ever do.
</p>

<p>
	What you can do is realize death is an illusion.

<p>
	Psychedelics can be a great way to take your growth to a whole new level.
</p>

<p>
	But also don't neglect your sexual needs. At your age sex is healthy and good. Just do it responsibly. Get you fill of it. Get a girlfriend. Enjoy it for fucks sake. You're only human. You ain't ready to be saint just yet.
</p>

<p>
	Burn through some of your karma. You're young. You've got time.
</p>

<p>
	Don't view sex as a dirty, bad, or unholy thing. Sex is very holy when done right. Even masturbating is holy! Enjoy it. Stop judging yourself for it. Watching some porn is not going to destroy your life or even keep you from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all sex is masturbation. Since there is only one entity is existence. Sex with anyone other than yourself is metaphysically impossible! Lol

<p>
	Not a belief at all. You're just not conscious yet that "the brain" is a mental construction within consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	See, your own biological birth is a mental construction. It only happened because you say it did. If you stop saying it, it will stop being real. The only way you could be born is by imagining it. And thus you were born!

<p>
	There is no universe. You're inside a hallucination. Don't believe it. Take a close look. The truth cannot stay hidden from those who seriously look for it.
</p>

<p>
	YES! The Truth is very radical stuff. You have no idea how radical. Nothing I say could convey just how radical it is. Whatever you imagine is not radical enough to be True. Since human imagination is merely finite.

<p>
	Tell that to Elliot Hulse.
</p>

<p>
	Being a gym rat aligns well with MGTOW and RedPill.
</p>

<p>
	Gym rats are not exactly the most evolved males of our species. Very chimp-like they tend to be.

<p>

<p>
	Everything looks nice in retrospect. Even the shittiest things. Because you conveniently ignore the suffering and egoic restlessness which was present.
</p>

<p>
	Nostalgia is a great trick of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Also, as a child and teen you didn't have to worry about your survival as much. Which meant you could just BE. Now as an adult you live in the conceptual future all the time, constantly worrying about and strategizing about how to survive. This entire cycle of survival is inherently unfulfilling and disconnects you from BEing.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to whitewash how neurotic and unconscious you used to be. How much you used to suffer. It's easy to forget after lots of consciousness work. You literally cannot remember what it was like to be you 10-20 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	Proof can only work if the person hearing the proof surrenders his denial. No amount of proof works on a person whose mind is closed.

Witches were in engaging in pagan rituals and psychedelics which threatened the monopoly and orthodoxy of The Chruch.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this witch craze got used as an excuse to then silence and excute anyone who was an enemy of The Chruch, even if they weren't a proper witch. The Chruch demonized witches and anything resembling witchcraft.
</p>

<p>
	Many of our most advanced mystics were silenced or executed. As is still done in the Middle East.
</p>

<p>
	Such is how devilry works. The illusion of duality must be maintained at all costs.

	Love is the point of life. It is both masculine and feminine.
</p>

<p>
	I like both kinds of love.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I'm stronger in masculine love.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you balance my work out with softer fuzzier kinds of teachers like Matt Kahn. He appeals to lots of women.
</p>

<p>
	I definitely believe the feminine path to awakening is unique, and just as valid as the masculine. Something like Zen is not suitable for many people and many women.
</p>

<p>
	For you masculine guys I highly recommend experimenting with feminine approaches and paths. It will grow you a lot and make you more mature as a man.
</p>

<p>
	Men today lack femininity even more than they lack masculinity. RedPill, MGTOW, anti-SJW, and Alt-Right culture is making this problem only worse. Which makes me sad <img alt=":(" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/sad.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/sad@2x.png 2x" title=":(" width="20" />

			Do you think some neurosis in spiritually attuned people are caused, in part, by developing an identity that they are abnormal and trying to be “normal”? (without being aware their “abnormality” is spiritual attunement). For these types of neuroses, awareness would be curative.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Definitely.
</p>

<p>
	If you are spiritually atuned but your society gaslights you by telling you you're crazy, that can create a very difficult upbringing. This can not only lead to neurosis but even psychosis.
</p>

<p>
	This is a classic problem. People with paranormal powers are especially vulnerable since materialist society refuses to admit such things are real. No doctor or therapist will admit it so people don't know where to turn.
</p>

<p>
	Witches and psychics need to forge their own paths. They cannot just follow the herd. It can take them decades to fully accept their abilities and learn how to use them responsibly.
</p>

<p>
	It's very much like being a Force-sensitive Jedi without any master to train you. A lot of things can go wrong.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just a matter of awareness, such folks need good guidance from masters, and they need to do lots of research. They also need to find like-mind people to befriend.
</p>

	You don't gotta be perfect. Just par for the course will do. Even a few boogies can be recovered from.

<p>
	Psychedelics are very misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
	Do not trust anyone who has not done at least 30 trips.
</p>

<p>
	And even then, you must do it yourself to truly understand their power.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the #1 spiritual growth tool I have found. Nothing else comes close. No guru.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason they are denounced. Because they rob everyone of power over you.
</p>

<p>
	Even someone like Sadhguru can be closedminded on some things. Don't assume he is infallible.

<p>
	Yeah, that's because you're not seriously questioning the materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Your ego maintains the materialist paradigm as an achor so that your whole reality doesn't collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Trip more and question more and your whole reality will collapse. That will be your first serious breakthrough trip.
</p>

<p>
	Trip so deep you realize there is no world, no brain, no science, and no drug.
</p>

<p>
	But of course precisely for this reason you will shy away from tripping again. You don't want to turly awaken. You want to play games and stall out the clock.

<title>A critique on spiritual states and insights</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Spiritual states and insights are extremely important. Just don't cling to them.
</p>

<p>
	What most people lack is higher states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	They can worry about letting them go AFTER they have some. Without these states the mind will never understand the depth of this work.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot escape states. A state is at work in you at all times. It's just usually a very low egoic state. Talking about spirituality to someone who has only ever been in a low egoic state is almost useless.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment cannot ever be easy because it's hard by design of the one who is asleep.

<p>
	Seems like it. Tons of people report having done so.
</p>

<p>
	Actually the "soul" is guiding your whole life. If you want to think of it that way. It is your highest self. It's the thing which compels you to pursue spirituality and reunite with God. Without that you'd never awaken. Which is why most people never awaken: their souls are too crude and unevolved.
</p>

<p>
	At least that's the theory if you want to buy into reincarnation.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most compelling reasons for buying into reincarnation is that it explains why people have such different inclinations and attunement for spiritual work. This cannot be explained through genetics or upbringing alone. It's obvious that some people are MUCH more spiritually attuned than others from birth. The best explanation for this is past lives.
</p>

<p>
	The souls of the majority of mankind are quiet crude. Which explains why mankind is in such a big mess.
</p>

<p>
	We are NOT all the same. If you've ever wondered why you don't fit in and how other people could be so dull, materialistic, and shallow, well, here's your answer. Most folks need to live through many more lifetimes before they learn their lesson. One lifetime is just not enough.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possibility that the reason you're able to do this work at all is because you've already lived through 300 lifetimes of total barbarism and stupidity. Imagine if you were Stalin in a past life. LOL.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I prefer the Kriya yoga which I have discussed at length on this forum. I think it's more direct.
</p>

<p>
	But I also think many of you could benefit a lot from hatha yoga. But I hold Kriya yoga as far more important than hatha.
</p>

<p>
	Again, these are just my opinions. Form your own opinions through experimentation.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Except there is a common through-line between dreams. Your psyche is uniquely your psyche. Dreams ARE connected to your psyche. You often have repeating dreams and you dream about stuff which is related to your life experiences, although often in very loose ways. You work stuff out in your dreams. This is actually directly analogous to how reincarnation could work. There is a deeper structure which unifies all your lifetimes. This structure would be called the soul. It is like the mothership which sends down many probes to a new planet. Destruction of any probe does not harm the mothership. The mothership collects all the lessons of each dead probe and visits many different planets. The mothership itself could of course also be destroyed but that's another matter. The mothership is far more conscious and capable than any of its probes.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	You guys are totally underestimating how deep survival goes! Stop thinking of survival as the physical preservation of your body. It is not that. Survival is about maintaining WHO YOU ARE.
</p>

<p>
	You are not a survival failure. You are maintaining WHO YOU ARE perfectly. Such that you even refuse to admit that what you're doing is survival.
</p>

<p>
	If WHO YOU ARE is an idiot, for example, then you spend a lot of time and energy preserving that way of life. You are playing an idiot perfectly in that case. You structure your entire way of life such that you can keep being an idiot. And any attempt to stop that will be perceived by you as death. It does not matter that being an idiot might be harmful to your physical survival. You might even walk off a cliff. But you'll still be an idiot at your moment of death, which is precisely what you wanted.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you do is about maintaining WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE. If you think you're a bird, you might jump off a cliff and flap your arms. It does not matter that you fall to your death. As long as you keep thinking you're a bird. Right before you hit the ground your mind will rationalize it all away as, "Well, I must be one of those non-flying birds, like a ostrich."
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The problem with the "leaving a note" approach is that if you die and you have a choice to reincarnate as whatever you want, your perspective will be so much broader at that point after death that you will not care about honoring any note you left behind. You might reincarnate on some other planet in some other universe as some non-human being. Reincarnating just for the sake of demonstrating reincarnation to other humans is a really silly game. That is not the purpose of reincarnation.

<p>
	There are valuable lessons to be learned from Spiral Dynamics stage Purple. That's where many indigenous shamans are at.
</p>

<p>
	But also don't confuse stage Purple shamans with Turquoise sages. That would be a big mistake. Shamans are still missing a lot of development even though they can be quite high in spiritual development. But spiritual development is not the only important line of development.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why we hear about a lot of shamans who abuse their followers.
</p>

<p>
	A shaman will be ethnocentric and unable to see outside of his culture & traditions. A shaman will also have a rather superstitious worldview which does not accord with science or reason. This is okay, but also limited and partial.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Listening to music is very much a survival strategy for most people.
</p>

<p>
	The types of music you select and why you listen to in the first place is about who you identify yourself to be, and maintaining that. Music is like a drug that puts the ego in a good mood. How many times have you used music to boost your state and make yourself feel better when you're down? How many times have you used music to get laid? How many times have you used music to drown out annoying noise or relieve boredom? How many times have you used music to facilitate bonding with other people?
</p>

<p>
	None of your enjoyments are innocent. They're all part of a larger survival strategy.
</p>

<p>
	This is careful work which must be done. Not just talked about or some conclusions reached. Your conclusions do not matter much. What matters is your ability to be conscious of this stuff on a minute-by-minute basis.

	A lot of shamans have a low level of cognitive developmemt: pre-rational magical.
</p>

<p>
	They can still be very wise, but it is not the highest levels of spiritual attainment and they will be dysfunctional in many ways. They don't have a global holisitic perspective.

	There is Absolute Truth. Which you can become conscious of.
</p>

<p>
	This is reality as it looks from God's POV.

<p>
	You can find dirt on any person.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to look at the totality of a person's life.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of listening to others critiques. Go read Gandhi's biography.
</p>

<p>
	Overall what Gandhi accomplished was amazing, regardless of whatever flaws you might dig up.
</p>

<p>
	You can find a lot of dirt on Osho especially. He has no business judging Gandhi.

<title>How do I escalate physical touch with a girl?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/35181-how-do-i-escalate-physical-touch-with-a-girl/?do=findComment&amp;comment=432086</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I consider smooth physical escalation a cornerstone of good dating technique. You can get ridiculously good at it and girls love it.
</p>

<p>
	Entire manuals have been written on it. Search for "kino escalation". This is one part of the Mystery Method which was actually quite good and practical.
</p>

<p>
	The rule of thumb is, you start to physically touch her within seconds of meeting her. During the day time physical escalation needs to be very mild. But during night time, like at bars and clubs, it can be very heavy.
</p>

<p>
	It needs to be very natural, which means you need to feel that it's natural for her to feel that it's natural.
</p>

<p>
	Start with non-erotic areas like hand, arm, shoulder. Then move to hug. Then holding hands. Then playing with and rubbing various parts of her body. Make it as casual and playful as possible.
</p>

<p>
	So typically you shake her hand as soon as you meet her. Then you might pat her on the shoulder. Then you might take her hand in your hand and immediately throw it away. Then you might get real close to her body and immediately step back. Then you might take her hand and examine her bracelet, ring, or watch. Then you might tell her to give you a hug. Then you might hold her hand as she walks with you. Then you might put your hands around her waist as you square up to her. Then you might gently run your finger along her jaw line. Then a very short kiss, no tongue. Then you might rub her hips. Then you might pull her into your chest. Then you might squeeze or spank her butt in a playful way. Then you might fondle her tits over her clothes. Then you might breathe on her neck. Then you might gently bite her neck. Then you might run your hands through her hair, gently grabbing and pulling it. And by this point you need to isolate her to a private location for heavy makeout, foreplay, and sex.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to get comfortable doing all this is to go out to rowdy nightclubs and open every girl with physical openers and practice escalating as quickly as possible until she pushes you way. You'll be amazing how far you can get how quickly. Try even going for an instant makeout. All of this builds your comfort level and confidence such that later you can escalate smoothly on any girl in any situation and it will feel natural to her.
</p>

<p>
	She does not have to be drunk for any of this. But obviously if alcohol is involved you can get away with a lot more a lot faster. Mostly she doesn't even need to drink the alcohol. All that's required is that you're in a social space where such things are seen as normal. Whatever you do needs to fit the social situation you're in. At bars and clubs this kind of heavy physicality is totally normal. Obviously not at the mall during day time. There you play it more chill. Although I've met a guy who would hit on women at the mall and have sex with them in that very same mall! LOL! You'll be amazed at what you can get away with when you're smooth and confident.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously for any of this to work she has to show some attraction to you. Although the initial few steps of physical escalation require no attraction. Touching any erotic areas requires a degree of attraction.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to tell if a girl is attracted to you is by looking in her eyes. Does she look into your eyes and hold contact? Does she follow your lead and listen to your words? Then she's attracted. If she's looking away from you a lot, she's not attracted. You need to capture her attention with charm, humor, and confidence.
</p>

<p>
	This is a very tricky and complex topic.
</p>

<p>
	For now, the best thing you can do is carefully study your own survival in action. Don't worry to much about how to stop it or what it will ulitmately be like.
</p>

<p>
	Study it first. Awareness alone is curative.
</p>

<p>
	So long as you are a human you cannot ignore survival. Even enlightened masters must worry about food and water. To be alive is to survive. But you can make your survival much more conscious.
</p>

<title>Can 5 meo dmt be a traumatic experience too?</title>

<p>
	Yes, it can certainly be truamatic. Not the coming back part but the exploding into infinity part.
</p>

<p>
	If all of God was revealed to you in one minute, you would be so horrified you would curl up into a little ball in the corner of the room.
</p>

<p>
	That's how BIG and awesome God is. So gradual exposure is required. It's like looking at the sun. It's radiance is too great for mere mortals. You take short little peaks at it.
</p>

Nothing wrong with that.
</p>

<p>
	Just remember that once you meet the Buddha you must kill him.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with all religious teachings is that the imagery of the teaching itself becomes the final cord which must be cut for final liberation.
</p>

<p>
	For a Christian, the final obstacle will be to throw away her notion of God and Christ -- to finally realize the actual God. Only after this final step will you become a true Christian in the way Jesus wanted.

			I'm interested in this too Leo. It's like I've done things backwards. I started deconstructing my self image 16 years ago, before I had constructed a healthy ego... This led to mental illness. I've now had enlightenment experiences, yet I have never even tried to create a healthy self image, so have basically lived without an identity for the past 16 years. I'm now 32. Would you suggest that I attempt to create some sort of identity now, or just continue bringing the ox back home? Thanks. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I would bet you already many kinds of identity. So you don't need to create it.
</p>

<p>
	But what you could do is self-esteem work, shadow work, and various forms of therapy or basic self-help to make your identity less neurotic and more wholesome.
</p>

<p>
	Many books exists on these topics. Go to a book store and explore their self-help section.

	God's paradise is a trillion times greater than the hell that you imagined above as paradise.

	God's paradise is so infinitely good that it allows you to create your own hell inside it. Which you have just done unwittingly.

	No one can really stop you from self-actualizing. Not even if you're put into a jail cell. In fact, being in a jail cell is a good place to do serious work.
</p>

<p>
	You can go to a library or school and use their computers. You can meditate outdoors in a park or forest. You can contemplate in your room or at a cafe. You can even meditate in the bathroom. Make a hot bath and meditate in it for 1 hr.

	You can have all the theory you could listen to in 10 lifetimes on a single iPod. Not just my theory, anyone's theory.

	I have about 400 GB of theory on my phone and another 5-10 TB on my PC. You can even listen to it in the shower like I do.

<p>
	Let it all go. Throw it all away. Deconstruct yourself until there's nothing left to cling to. That is the truest spirituality.

<p>
	Like I said, this is where it gets mindfucky: there both is and isn't, depending on how you look at it.
</p>

<p>
	Even the deepest awakening is still not total. I don't think that's possible in human form. Human form is designed to be limited. We are lucky that being conscious of infinity is even possible for such chimps as us. If you were born a donkey you would have no such luxury.

<p>
	This is where it gets really mindfucky.
</p>

<p>
	You can be fully awake, but your consciousness will still not be total in the sense that there will many aspects of the physical world which you aren't accessing.
</p>

<p>
	You can be fully conscious of infinity, yet still not know what your neighbor had for lunch.
</p>

<p>
	To be human is to have certain limitations. Once your body dies, then I assume those limits will be released.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bit a mathematician can know what a prime number is, but still not know what the one millionth prime number is. To understand primes does not mean you have to know every single prime individually.
</p>

<p>
	For example I can know that I am you without even knowing what you look like.
</p>

<p>
	Firstly that's untrue. A lot of Blue and Orange people follow me for example.
</p>

<p>
	You can train yourself to become a Spiral Wizard and bridge builder.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, demonstration is more important than preaching. Look at Gandhi, Buddha, Jesus, MLK, etc. They helped stage Blue and lower people.
</p>

<p>
	Do not wait for people to rise to your level, lead them there.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to lead everyone. Lead those who will listen. At least 25% of people will listen with an open mind. Learn to appeal to peoples inner goodness, love, and higher self. Inspire them!

<title>What Is The Point Of Life? // Lessons and Questions</title>

<p>
	Be careful holding nirvana as a separate from form or samsara. From God's POV they are identical. So if you imagine nirvana as a formless realm of pure emptiness and bliss, that is true, but that is also incomplete. That's only one side of the coin. The other side is manifest relative reality.
</p>

<p>
	So to say that "God gets bored" simply means: a state of pure formlessness is unstable. It cannot stay that way because it bursts forth with infinite creative force. It must explode into infinite manifestation.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all of this happens instantly, prior to time. Is already is, always was, and always will be. That is true, full, nondual Nirvana: formless and formed forever as one.
</p>

<title>Leo, Should we even have a Self-Image? I'm Confused</title>

<p>
	It's smart to improve one's self-image first before trying to totally transcend it.
</p>

<p>
	Most of you guys would benefit from some basic self-esteem and self-image work.
</p>

<p>
	A weak self-image is too insecure to allow itself to be transcended.
</p>

<p>
	Transcending the self-image is the highest stage of Maslow's pyramid.

<p>
	Newton was a wise guy.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to abandon science. What we are doing here is science of the highest order: the science of self, mind, life, and God.
</p>

<p>
	Just breathe the spirit back into orthodox science. If people like you don't, who will?
</p>

<p>
	If Newton were alive today he would be doing just that.
</p>

<p>
	Be the change you wish to see.

<p>
	To have no self-image at all is the highest level of awakening. You then become God.
</p>

<p>
	God is what remains after the self-image is bypassed/transcended.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to transcend the self-image in one go. It takes years of deconstruction work and multiple awakenings.

<title>Confusion “conceptual” vs. “Physical” limitation consciousness</title>

<p>
	The duality between physical and conceptual must of course collapse.
</p>

<p>
	You are not looking through your eyes. That you doesn't exist at all. Emptiness imagines there is a you who is looking through some eyes.
</p>

<p>
	There is a limit to how far you can look, feel, think only given your present state of consciousness. In higher states of consciousness (like on a psychedelic) it is possible to see, feel, and think unlimited and "impossible" things.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it's possible to become the entire universe or see aliens from another universe and talk with them telepathically. These occurances are more real, not less real, than your current physical reality.

	Survival is a complex affair, often selfish as well as symbiotic. You can't be totally selfish because in the end selfish and selfless are one.

<p>
	Hitler was nice to his dogs and even the worst mass murderers have done kind things for some people.
</p>

<p>
	You can't find a 100% selfish organism.

			One thing that I don’t understand about ‘helping people awaken’ is the fact that most people don’t want to awaken. I don’t very often see people asking me “please help me become enlightened” or “please help me reach stage turquoise”. If that were the case, I would gladly give them all my support.

<p>
	People are like children and sheep, what they want is not good for them and they have no idea what they really want.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't mean you force them into anything, this means they require conscious leadership. Shows them what they are missing. Show them who they can be. Wake them up to their own highest possibilities.
</p>

<p>
	Without conscious leadership the world will destroy itself.

<p>
	Meditate, don't eat for 4 hours, then plug it, get mindfucked, then eat after the trip is over.

<p>
	Every seriously awake person understands he/she is God. They just may not put it in those words because they know most people will balk at that. So instead they try to quietly guide to realize it for yourself without explicitly saying it to your face, because they know this triggers the ego.
</p>

<p>
	It's called spirituality for a reason. Don't overlook the obvious.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way to escape the fact that you are God. This is the very heart of awakening. Do not try to turn God into some secular materialist thing. It actually is God, not anything else. This must be faced head on. Accepting yourself as God is an important aspect of this work because people are so in denial about it. You can't be embody God so long as you're in denial that you are God. It's the ego which is denying it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You don't need anyone. You don't need a shaman. You ARE the shaman. You ARE GOD! And all the answers are inside of you.
</p>

<p>
	You will never grow faster or deeper than doing a solo retreat. Here is where you truly confront yourself. This is how all the most advanced yogis do it.
</p>

<p>
	Want to grow more in 1 month than you have in 10 years? Take 30 days off for a solo retreat. Add in psychedelics and BAM! There is no faster way to grow yourself.
