</p>

<p>
	There is a structural differnce between the two. A stage Green person has no desire to be a fascist. They have outgrown that.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, sometimes a Green person might get upset or act foolish, but they will not create a fascist government.
</p>

<p>
	TYT is never going to lead to fascism. Of course it can still be biased and lead to other lesser problems.

<title>Is being a Polymath a sustainable life purpose?</title>

<p>
	Keep in mind that things have evolved a lot since Da Vinci's time.
</p>

<p>
	Today to succeed you must be more specialized. You can't be an architect, a painter, an engineer, and a writer because you will be out-competed by others who specialize in just one thing.
</p>

<p>
	Back in Da Vinci's time fields like engineering, architecture, etc. were not as developed or deep as they are today. It will take you 10 years of study just to become a decent engineer. And now you need work experience, licenses, certifications, etc.
</p>

<p>
	So you can certainly be a polymath in the casual sense of studying lots of topics, but you ain't gonna master them all enough to make a career out of. Pick your career field more carefully. Even something like Engineering is far too broad. You need to pick what kind of engineer you want to be.
</p>

<p>
	Competition is a lot more fierce today. So many amazing specialists to compete against. And it's a global marketplace. In Da Vinci's time the marketplace was a single city of 300,000 people.
</p>

<p>
	I would prefer to go vegetarian for ethical reasons if it didn't disrupt my life too much.
</p>

<p>
	Of course taste of the food is a factor. Meat probably tastes better to me. But that could be retrained.
</p>

<p>
	But for example, I don't like eating fruit all the time. It becomes too sugary and gross. I don't know how people pull that off for long periods of time even if it gives them enough energy. My body doesn't tolerate a fruit only diet.

<p>
	It's not true acceptance if in the back of your mind you're accepting it only so that you can avoid facing it.
</p>

<p>
	"I accept that I have gay desires as long as that means I won't ever have any gay sex" << that's not acceptance!
</p>

<p>
	True acceptance would be: "It's okay if the only kind of sex I have in my life from now on is gay sex."
</p>

<p>
	Acceptance requires that you face the thing you don't want to face. Not hypothetically, but actually. That doesn't mean you actually have to have sex with a man, but you do have to face and accept the prospect of it until the point where it doesn't bother you.

<p>
	Yeah, what I'm saying is impossible to imagine from your current state of consciousness. You'd need a radical change of state.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, time and even cause & effect collapse in nonduality such that the impossible becomes possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can clearly recognize that you are the entire universe happening all at once. This is nondual awakening. No, it's not any analogy or explanation. You are the whole universe happening as we speak.
</p>

<p>
	Just as one example, I once became conscious that I wrote every book mankind has ever created. Not only did I write all the books in the universe, I am all of them too. The pages of every book is made out of my consciousness. And this goes for everything in the universe. I am everything that could ever possibly be. All of this is direct absolute truth. Not explanation or thinking or theory. It is not even perception. It is more true than perception and more true than mathematics.

<p>
	The ultimate truth is that male and female are both just aspects of your infinite self. You can have male and female orgasms. Both masculine and feminine energies are running through you and you will become most powerful once you integrate them both and experience life from both POVs.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine how powerful you would be if you were totally comfortable with your sexuality no matter what it was. That is true strength.
</p>

<p>
	To worry or fear about being gay is weakness.
</p>

<p>
	This is why Self-Love is the ultimate strength. It requires total fearlessness. So this is great opportunity for you to train yourself to be strong. A strong man is able to have sex with another man. A weak man is not. Your culture has this all backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Dude, look at the silliness of your position.
</p>

<p>
	If you desire to be fucked, that's YOUR DESIRE, YOUR WANT. The problem is that you are denying your own wants. The solution is to accept your own wants. It is your right to deny your own wants or embrace them.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I came to you and said I want to eat ice cream. But I don't want ice cream. I hate ice cream. Don't I have a right to hate ice cream? I'm so unlucky to want ice cream.
</p>

<p>
	You would call me insane.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is simply that your culture has brainwashed you to believe that men aren't supposed to enjoy getting fucked. But all that is, is cultural brainwashing. You must question your own cultural norms and assumptions until you realize that they are completely arbitrary, groundless, and even dysfunctional, as in this case. Your culture tells you that men shouldn't enjoy getting fucked, yet the truth is that many men in your culture enjoy it. So what is the point of following a culture which is so clearly untruthful? You'd have to be crazy to buy into such a culture. Then again, you were brainwashed into it from birth, so it feels like it shouldn't be questioned.
</p>

<p>
	You are all bodies, all beings, all things.
</p>

<p>
	If you woke up as a kangaroo tomorrow, you'd still be asking, "Why this kangaroo? Why not something else?" And so it would go until you went through every being and ended up right where you are right now. Someone has to be in your shoes. So here you are! Actually, no one is in your shoes. No one is in everyone's shoes, looking through everyone's eyes.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, since you are the only being in existence, you have to be in all places at once. So you are in this place right now. Every place is as important as any other.

<p>
	Yeah, it really depends a lot on the culture. It won't fly so well in under-developed countries with traditional cultures like the Middle East.
</p>

<p>
	If your friends are stage Orange/Green or Green, it should be okay. But low Orange and below will be a problem. Blue will be a big problem.
</p>

<p>
	Homosexuals basically don't exist in Blue cultures. Because they are demonized and even killed if they come forward. Blue forces a repression of homosexuality. It's a total denial.

<p>
	I'm no expert on it, but the whole theme of interpreting human actions as a desire for sex, sexual organs, hidden perverted sexual desires, and all the mother/father stuff is just way too overblown.
</p>

<p>
	A being's actions are not primarily about sex, they are about self-survival. Sex is a tiny part of that. Psychoanalysis doesn't understand this and of course it doesn't understand spirituality, self-transcendence, nonduality, epistemology, or metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	Freud projected his own sexual perversions onto the world and saw in the world a reflection of his own neurotic shadow self. But just because Freud was that way doesn't mean we all are that way. In fact most of us are not.
</p>

<p>
	I don't find Freud's theories useful for personal development or self-transcendence. There are much better frameworks. Most self-help frameworks are better. Go grab any random book in the self-help isle of the bookstore and you will get better and more useful advice for improving your life than by reading Freud. Any book on my book list will be far better.
</p>

<title>Overcoming stage green ego</title>

<p>
	I agree we need to distinguish between progressives and neoliberals/centrists.
</p>

<p>
	But how it's done is also important. It's important to recognize that lots of people are neoliberals and centrist liberals because that is their level of development. You can't brow-beat them into becoming progressives. Almost by definition progressives are the rarest ones on the political spectrum.
</p>

<p>
	So while it's important to not confuse a neoliberal for a progressive, attacking neoliberals and centrist Dems is problematic because you just can't convert all Dems into progressives. There needs to be coalition and some mutual acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	My problem with Jimmy Dore is that I feel he's too aggressive. It's like red meat for progressives but it won't work to build a coalition. Being a rabid dog is not a good way to go. Bernie is very progressive but he's not so rabid and obnoxious about it, which allows him to attract people who normally wouldn't call themselves progressives or socialists or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	A very important principle for you to learn is that of meeting people where they're at. This will come up for you over and over again in life if you're going to be an advanced human. A lot of people will not be as advanced as you, and your solution to that cannot be to obnoxiously attack or "otherize" them.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that these are all your brothers and sisters. That is the real challenge. It would be so much easier if we could otherize half the population and lock them up in Montana. But we can't.
</p>

<title>No love, why?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44576-no-love-why/?do=findComment&amp;comment=560178</link>

<p>
	Unconditional Love definitely has a feeling to it, too.
</p>

<p>
	You're simply missing a mystical experience of Love. Try contemplating what love is on a psychedelic. You're disconnected from Being, and thinking about love in the abstract is not going to be enough to reconnect you. You need a direct experience to jolt you awake.
</p>

<p>
	You might also want to optimize your brain health, mental health, nutrition, energy, etc. to make sure that some chemical imbalance or energetic block is not obstructing you. Get blood work done. Check for vitamin deficiencies, heavy metal toxicity, etc. Dial in your health because it is the foundation for everything else.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you have too much lead or mercury in your brain, you may not be able to feel love the way you otherwise could.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't feel anything, that shows me some deeper underlying chemical or health issue. Or possibly some energetic blockage. That is not normal. Start researching your symptoms.
</p>

	You have no idea how your computer works. And your computer is an illusion. That doesn't make you qualified to talk about computer engineering.

<p>
	If you're practicing Sedona Method, you gotta let go 100s and 1000s of times.
</p>

<p>
	You don't just let go once and you're done. It's more like meditation, where you get go of one thought, but then it comes back and you keep letting it go 1000 times.

<p>
	That's not the issue.
</p>

<p>
	The point is: feel love for yourself either way.
</p>

<p>
	Don't THINK about love but actually FEEL love for yourself and your addictive situation. The way a loving mother might if you told her you're addicted to weed. That doesn't mean she wants you doing more weed. But she would lovingly empathize for the challenging situation you find yourself in. Do that, but to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Separate the love from your plans to fix the problem. Love first, fix later. As guys we tend to skip immediately to the fixing phase, skipping the love and acceptance phase.
</p>

<p>
	And if you slip and do more weed even though you intended to stop. Love yourself for that failure too.
</p>

<p>
	This is silly.
</p>

<p>
	There is still a big excess of masculine energy in government and positions of power. We are nowhere near a healthy balanced point.
</p>

<p>
	Again, this is a conflation of stage Green with stage Red. The worry that stage Green will become fascistic is totally overblown. The bigger worry is actual stage Red & Blue fascism -- which is still a real force around the world.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be wise enough to pick the right things to worry about. Worrying about excess Green is like worrying about the women's bathroom on the Titanic while it is sinking. Your worry is misdirected.

<p>
	1) It's an excellent teaching
</p>

<p>
	2) If you still have no clue how to let go, you haven't really been listening. The teaching is super, super simple.
</p>

<p>
	There is no method for letting go. You just let go. That is the method. Simple. But it requires practice. Stop looking for intellectual explanations. Just do it.

	You can cycle practices throughout the year, to keep things fresh and yet not overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
	The point of trying lots of practices is to find those small handful which you will commit to. And also to have ones in the back pocket for when your life takes a turn in the future and you are in need of some specific one. These practices will be useful throughout the rest of your time at different points.

<p>
	I think what everyone overlooks is the simple fact that people have different nutritional needs. There is no one best diet in the abstract. The question is always: What is the best diet <u>FOR ME</u>? And that you can only discover through trial and error.
</p>

<p>
	There are many factors at play: your genetics, geography, climate, your budget, your health conditions, your level of development, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I have found that vegetarian does not work well for me. It doesn't give me the energy that I need to function well. But it would be a mistake to apply my conclusion to all other people. My conclusion is for me.
</p>

<title>Is a world Government even possible?</title>

<p>
	Obviously systems would need to be put in place such that there is no chance of a tyrant controlling the world government. There needs to be robust system of checks and balances and a robust impeachment process for any high level leaders. There need to be independent ethics boards with power to investigate and also to remove corrupt leaders.
</p>

<p>
	Basically we need a World Constitutional Convention as we had in America back at its founding where all the countries agree on a set of rules and norms for how the world government will function, with a set of checks and balances to make sure it is protected against devirly and manipulation.
</p>

<p>
	All of this will happen, but probably not in our lifetimes. Citizens aren't developed enough yet to see the wisdom in such a system. People are too xenophobic, prideful, and nationalistic still. A world government can only work when a large amount of citizens have a global identity. People would have to stop seeing themselves as Chinese, Hindu, Jew, American, Japanese, German, Christian, Muslim, etc. and just see themselves humans.
</p>

<p>
	I was going to but hesitated because I have a feeling it's gonna be a nasty come-up.
</p>

<p>
	Why go through nastiness when there are so many other substances that go down smoothly?
</p>

<p>
	But if was going to do mescaline I would definitely go pure synthetic.
</p>

<p>
	The cactus is there as a last resort if you've got no other choice.
</p>

<p>
	Synthetic is going to dose a lot more accurately.

<p>
	Energetic and paranormal aspects of spirituality. Things like reiki, healing, psychics, siddhis, etc. I know they are real but I don't understand how they work.
</p>

<p>
	Serious mental health issues like schizophrenia, psychosis, and other such mental "disorders", treating suicidal people, treating clinically depressed people, etc. Which is why I avoid those issues in my work.

<p>
	One army is far more efficient than 1000 armies all fighting each other.
</p>

<p>
	Our current system is insanely inefficient. We lost $2-3 trillion in the Iraq war alone.
</p>

<p>
	Military spending is the single greatest waste of human resources. That is trillions of dollars going to fund devilry.

<p>
	Sadhguru has a lot of good teachings. Just don't look up to him on politics. Politics is not no his field of mastery.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that even the best teachers are only good within their domain of mastery. Not across the board on all topics.

	You can also buy them on Amazon for cheap.

If it works for you, then be happy with that. People will naturally be closedminded and skeptical about psychic methods.
</p>

<p>
	Your best shot at glimpsing enlightenment is to patiently work to solve your mental health issues, ween off meds, and then take a psychedelic. You will see what enlightenment is.

	If you think the progressive movement isn't woke enough for you, you're out of luck in this lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	By fighting with progressives you end up helping the conservative devils who don't give a damn about minorities for the most part.
</p>

<p>
	Don't overthink politics. When you have a choice between A, B, and C -- pick the most progressive one and be satisfied. The system can only evolve so fast.
</p>

<p>
	Today's candidates are the best and most progressive ever. We are lucky to have them. Don't forget how bad things have been in the recent past.

<p>
	Once you know that your heart is not into a thing, that is the end of that. There is no use pretending you can make it work.
</p>

<p>
	If your heart is not into engineering you will never succeed at it. So that's not even an option for you.
</p>

<p>
	Just accept it and move on with pursuing what your heart is calling you to do. Deal with the obstacles and problems as they arise. If your parents refuse to help you in following your heart, then follow it anyway without their help.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let following your heart be negotiable. You can't succeed at something your heart isn't into.

<p>
	This whole thing about psychics being frauds is way overblown.

<p>
	It's mostly an excuse made by materialists because they do not want to admit that psychic abilities are real.

<p>
	First you must admit that psychic abilities are real. Then we can acknowledge that a few people are frauds and avoid them.

<p>
	Awakening comes with surrendering the ego-mind's insistence on control. It is the ego-mind which wants to manipulate reality. The ego-mind cannot be allowed to do whatever it wants as that would become hell.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if Bin Laden could materialize a nuclear bomb with his mind.
</p>

<p>
	Such power can only be allowed to the most selfless and loving. And infinite power can only be allowed to a completely selfless being -- the Godhead. Having form automatically limits your power. The cost of infinite power is total formlessness and total selflessness to the point where no one can even know you exist.

<p>
	It's pretty clear that they aren't speaking from some memorized script but that they are getting intuitive visions as they work with you. Stuff pops up for them in real-time. It's not like they sat down and studied a book which said: "Okay, if this guy walks in complaining about his thyroid, you tell him he was choked in a past life. And if he walks in with a back ache, you tell him he broke his back in a past life."

<p>
	See my video about Division vs Unity. That's the issue you're bringing up here.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is a constant tug of war between division and unification. Neither one is good or bad by itself. Societies unify, divide, unify, divide, unify, divide.... at higher and higher orders. There must be a delicate balance between the two or things get ugly. That's life. Embrace this oscillatory process because it is an existential feature of how reality generates itself.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, culture is important in order to create a sense of social unity. But it can also easily get out of hand and become toxic and too monocultural. Culture by itself is not inherently good or bad. There are healthy and unhealthy cultures. Distinguish between the two. Too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing.
</p>

<p>
	Also, your framing of our civilization as losing its purpose with the downfall of Christianity, that's a very limited view. Western civilization existed long before Christianity and will continue to exist long after. You are right though that we've had a flourishing of multiculturalism and a breakdown of the traditional Christian monoculture which used to unify the West. This was a necessary evolutionary step as we moved from Spiral stage Blue to Orange and beyond.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget how vicious, cruel, corrupt, and oppressive the Christian monoculture was. They burned witches at the stake. Today I can go find a witch on Yelp and hire her for her healing and psychic services. It's much better today.
</p>

<title>High Quality Resources - Question To Leo and the forum</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44480-high-quality-resources-question-to-leo-and-the-forum/?do=findComment&amp;comment=559004</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	You're right that you DO have to distinguish between good and bad resources, teachings, teachers, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This is a deep epistemic problem which ultimately roots in the problem of distinguishing truth from falsehood. How do you know what is true vs what is false? If you had an easy answer to that, you'd be awake and you wouldn't need to ask the question. The whole challenge of life is that when you enter it, you start from ground zero with no idea how to distinguish truth from falsehood. So then an epistemic journey begins. Through a combination of life experience, contemplation, research, intuition, wisdom, and trial & error you slowly learn to sort out truth from falsehood. Of course most people don't do this. They just blindly accept whatever their culture tells them. But in our work here, the whole point is to undertake a serious epistemic inquiry and derive the truth for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It's like putting together a puzzle or solving a criminal conspiracy. You have to investigate carefully and cross-reference everything.
</p>

<p>
	I addressed this process in this video:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/how-to-develop-big-picture-understanding" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/articles/how-to-develop-big-picture-understanding</a>
</p>

<p>
	Anything anyone tells you about what is true vs what is false, you cannot know if it is true or false because that would be to beg the question. Which is why a direct personal inquiry is required. The only way you can know if what I'm telling you is true and a good teaching is by investigating and validating it for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to jump straight to the answer, the highest teachings in the universe will emphasize a few key things:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Direct experience is king
	</li>
	<li>
		Consciousness is the key to everything
	</li>
	<li>
		Love is the highest truth
	</li>
	<li>
		Selflessness is the greatest power
	</li>
	<li>
		You are God, You are All
	</li>
	<li>
		Reality is ONE & infinite
	</li>
	<li>
		Death is an illusion
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't get stuck in any one belief system. All belief systems are relative and incomplete.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Of course, you don't know if the above is true or false unless you personally validate it. But I promise you that if you work at it, in 10 to 20 years from now, you can validate all the above beyond any doubt. But again, you don't know if that's true unless you actually do it.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of your life is to go on this grand epistemic journey, the end result of which -- if you do it very carefully -- is Truth with a capital T. And by that point you become the guru and people come to you for advice. But you also cannot really help them because you know the only way for them to know what you know is to go through the long and personal process you went through. Truth is simply too big to be told.
</p>

<p>
	I recently went to two different psychics/healers. Each one told me that they got a vision that I was strangled by the neck in a past life, which created a blockage of the throat chakra.
</p>

<p>
	Can't say if it's true or not, but it was quite amazing that two different people said something so specific. What are the odds of that?

	Even if you get pure synthetic mescaline it will still cause nausea, even if plugged. Mescaline's just not tolerated well by the body.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, it should be a lot more pleasant than drinking a gallon of cactus juice.
</p>

<p>
	Methallylescaline (MAL) is the closest synthetic mescaline analogue.
</p>

	<a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methallylescaline" rel="external nofollow">https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Methallylescaline</a>

<p>
	It will be much easier to dose than mescaline, and much cheaper.

</p>

<p>
	If you were going there to apprentice under a serious guru, that might be worth it. Probably not so good for starting a biz, although low cost of living and cheap labor can be very important when starting a biz. But there are other places you could do that from that might be better, like the Philippines.
</p>

<p>
	Online biz you can run from many places.

<p>
	Well.... it depends how you read. Of course reading can be a great adjunct to contemplation -- grist for the mill so to speak. But even so, reading tends to fill the mind with preconceived ideas and beliefs which limit serious contemplation. The best contemplation is done from scratch, without reliance on other people's ideas. Like deriving mathematical proofs for oneself without reading the textbook.
</p>

<p>
	Reading is useful, it just isn't deep contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	You need to learn to develop stuff on your own, without building on top of a mountain of others' ideas. This then allows you to think outside the box. If you build on a mountain of others' ideas, you will not think far enough outside the box because you're going to internalize all of their core assumptions and get stuck in paradigm lock. This is one of the biggest problems for academics and scientists. They rely too heavily on that mountain of ideas without thinking independently enough. And how do they get that mountain of ideas in their head? By reading a lot without deeply questioning what they read.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation is not taught in school or university. Because that would be too dangerous. Students are taught to be parrots, not true philosophers.
</p>

<p>
	I have seen Walmart and HomeDepot sell small San Pedros in pots for like $10. Not enough to eat, but perfect for your garden.

<p>
	Philosophy is love of wisdom. A philosopher is one who sits around contemplating reality. You can contemplate reality without reading a single book. Reading is not contemplating. You can go live in a cabin in the woods and be a philosopher.
</p>

<p>
	Philosophers in universities don't do much contemplating. They are like caged birds. Don't expect them to fly very far.

<p>
	Firstly, I don't know why you're so low. Orange/Green should be fairly attainable for you with a bit of personal dev work, which you'd be doing anyway as part of your coach training. Dare to aim high!
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, there still exists a lot of stage Blue people even in Canada who you could specialize in working with if you wanted to.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically, to be a good coach, you should be fairly decently developed and mature. That's sort of the point of going to a coach. If you're not mature enough yet, that's okay, just plan to be a coach later in your life and in the meantime train and work in some related fields. I wouldn't recommend becoming a coach if you are younger than 25 or even 30. You need some life experience first.
</p>

	Well, you know John The Baptist -- the guy who trained Jesus?
</p>

<p>
	You know why they called him John the Baptist? Because you came to him to find God, he would hold your head under water until you were near-drowned and dead, then he would pull you back up at the last second.
</p>

<p>
	If you were lucky you got a Near Death Experience.
</p>

<p>
	And so we got Baptism.
</p>

<p>
	Try doing that today and see how fast you get sued.
</p>

<p>
	And people complain Actualized.org is dangerous. Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	In India some yogis would do the ring of fire: where they sit you down naked in the middle of the hottest noon sun, then they light 4 fires around you, to the North, South, East, West, and have you sit through that for hours.

<p>
	That's just not true.
</p>

<p>
	Go apprentice under a serious Zen master or yogi. He will push your ass to enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse mainstream spiritual celebrities like Eckhart Tolle with some of the hardcore masters.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can take soft and hard approaches. The hard approach is not always best. It depends on the student. Most Western students simply can't handle the hard approach. Westerners tend to be soft and lazy these days.
</p>

<p>
	I've heard of a Japanese Zen master who would force his students to sit extra long without pee breaks so they could suffer a little bit more and wake up faster.

<p>
	When death comes for you, your only option will be surrender. Then you'll understand the wisdom in it.
</p>

<p>
	Manipulation and survival (what you're describing with your examples above) are always limited and will at some point hit a dead end. At that point the only thing left is surrender.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, go ahead and run from the lion if you can. But once the lion has you by the throat, you should surrender.
</p>

<p>
	The whole spiritual path is about learning the wisdom of surrender. Which is why most ego don't like to do it. They are too busy surviving and manipulating the world, hoping they can keep it up forever. But it never lasts. You cannot manipulate forever. That is devilry.

<p>
	I'm into personal development. I don't want some monkey on my back. You don't learn PU well when drunk. I have never had an interest in alcohol. It's like the opposite of a psychedelic: a stupid man's drug. It's also terrible for you. And here in Vegas drinks cost $10-$20 each! For $20 I can get a lap dance from a hot ass stripper who will rub her tits in my face.

			Should I try to force myself to love Being and reality more? Can I do Yoga and Meditation to develop this curiosity/passion for reality and metaphysical questions in general? What are some real practical tipps?

	All spiritual practices are ultimately about this. But even before you do heavy spiritual practice you can just start by being much more curious about small mundane things like ants, birds, trees, people, clouds, language, politics, religion, science, space, the moon, etc. There is no end to curiosity. Buy a telescope and look at the stars. Buy a microscope and look at the microscopic life in a puddle of water from the sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
	Leonardo Da Vinci is a great role-model for curiosity. Maybe study him and his work a bit.

<p>
	Or if you're really lazy, just search for cool stuff like this on Youtube:

If you want to believe in that sort of thing. In fact, you could go to multiple different ones and cross-reference their results.

<p>
	I've had some psychics read my past lives. It's interesting. Hard to say what it really means though because I don't have a direct experience of them so it ultimately boils down to a story from my POV. But if you could corroborate it with your own direct experience, that would be something even more interesting.
