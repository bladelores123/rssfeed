<p>
	Just the exposure of Trumpism is already raising consciousness as Trumpism looks so ugly to most people that we as a culture will agree that it's not the right path forward. Of course there will always be some fanatics who refuse to change their mind, but mostly people see that Trumpism is not a workable way forward. Even his own supporters are starting to admit it. You can't deny the obvious forever.
</p>

<p>
	All that's necessary is to shine sunlight on devilry and it will start to dissolve. Trump's whole presidency is that process unfolding.
</p>

<title>Difference Between Mystical Experience and Hallucination</title>

<p>
	All experience is a hallucination. It's just a matter of what kind of stuff you're hallucinating. The mind can be highly stable or highly unstable and everything in between. Highly stability does not make a hallucination any less a hallucination. It just creates a hallucination of stability and solidity.
</p>

<p>
	A brick wall is you hallucinating something solid and stable. Take a psychedelic and the brick wall will melt and morph. Then it will return back to solidity. Get shot in the head and the brick wall will cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	Classical psychological hallucinations like psychosis are the result of a less stable mind which tends to play by a different set of rules than ordinary minds. It's more dream-like. More like being on a psychedelic 24/7 but often mixed with ego, fear, and confusion. It's not clear like awakening or meditation. Hence people can hallucinate demons and other things like that.
</p>

<p>
	We will still be covering practical topics in the future. A lot of topics remain related to emotional mastery and those will all be practical.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff on business and success too. Relationships too. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	I just have a big backlog of metaphysical and spiritual topics which I've been executing. It won't always be like that. I'm not going to keep rehashing old topics. There's always new stuff to talk about with at least 200 new topics planned.
</p>

<p>
	There will also be a new paid course, which will be the most practical of all. ETA for that is sometime within the next 5 months.
</p>

<p>
	So much work, so little time.

<p>
	Of course it depends on what my goals are. If what I wanted was a serious relationship and he was actively doing pickup, then probably not. If he is at the point where he's already done a lot of pickup and got it out of his system and was willing to let it go, then that might be ideal. It's every girl's dream to lock down a stud.
</p>

<p>
	Girls hate the guy doing pickup but they love the end-results of pickup if they can lock the guy down at the end of it. Pickup refines the guy and makes him a stronger, more attractive man. Girls love that, but they don't want to know how the sausage was made. They want to assume he's a natural.
</p>

<p>
	It's like, "OMG! You're so good in bed! How did you get this way?"
</p>

<p>
	"Um... you don't wanna know."
</p>

<p>
	Like anything else in life, being attractive requires practice. Highly attractive people tend to have lots of practice.

<p>
	Don't be overly pessimistic. It depends on how you go about it. It's just that conscious relationships are rare and take work. But they can be done.

<p>
	Trump's strength is pure illusion. He's like the Wizard of Oz. People keep thinking he's strong because he got lucky and won once.
</p>

<p>
	If you're a betting man, bet on Trump's luck running out. Never bet against karma. It will catch up to him one of these years. He can't keep dodging it forever. What's amazing is how lucky he's been up to this point. But that won't hold up.
</p>

<p>
	In true poetic style he will end up hoisted by his own petard.
</p>

<p>
	It's foolish to bet on a devil prevailing over the truth in the long-run. A devil's victories are always short and fleeting.

<p>
	It's important to keep in mind that all systems have parasites and exploiters. This is not a condemnation of government per se. It's a fundamental aspect of nature. Parasites have existed for a billion years and will continue to exist for a billion more. This is not a valid excuse to not create better and bigger systems. In fact, this is why better and bigger systems evolve. The better government gets the less parasites will be able to abuse it.
</p>

<p>
	Bigger government is important precisely because its size helps to protect it from large corporate parasites. Government must be larger than the corporations it governs, otherwise things get squirrely.

			Ehh... so then how is nonduality you teach, different from solipsism? I don't get it, you are basically saying it's not solipsism yet only my mind exists??
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	First of all, solipsism is a conceptual scheme, a philosophical system. This is very different from actuality. In this sense solipsism is a fantasy whereas nonduality is actuality. Map vs territory. This is a HUGE difference. Don't underestimate this.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, solipsism is not even a good map. It does not recognize the truth of no-self and the truth that you are God. Solipsism is still dualistic in that it denies the reality of others by upholding the reality of the ego-self. Nonduality makes a more radical move. It denies the reality of all individual selves, especially oneself. If other people are unreal, you as a person must also be unreal.
</p>

<p>
	If you are unreal, then what are you? Solipsism doesn't answer this ultimate question.
</p>

<p>
	The part that solipsism gets right is that ultimately you are all alone. But what are you? You are not a finite being, as solipsism assumes. But when you finally realize that you are an infinite being, you will also realize that you are both alone and together, because infinity includes all dualities. You are so ONE that you cannot even distinguish oneness from twoness!

<p>
	Again, the difference between the two is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	People are imaginary BUT, since everything is imaginary and there is nothing but imagination, people are in this sense as real as anything can be.
</p>

<p>
	From the Absolute perspective people are unreal. From from the relative perspective people can be spoken of as if they are real. When I interact with many of you, I treat you as if you are real because that's helpful for navigating the everyday world of human survival. It would not be appropriate for me to treat the guy at the grocery store as if he was a cartoon character.
</p>

<p>
	But from the Absolute perspective I know that I am the only one here. Yet I don't live from this perspective most of my day as I run chores and do ordinary survival activities. The illusion of other is very strong, even after some awakenings. It's easy to fall back into the illusion of otherness, especially when people behave like dicks.

	It doesn't make sense to you because you are interpreting what I say from a dualistic paradigm which assumes a self/other distinction. You are projecting your delusion of duality onto what I say.

	I am conscious that other users on here are simply projections of a universal mind. You are not conscious of this. So when I speak to others, I know am just speaking to myself, but you do not know that because your ego is in the way. Your ego will not even allow you to imagine what it would be like to realize that the self/other distinction is unreal.
</p>

<p>
	No matter who I address I am addressing you and I am addressing myself because you, me, and all beings are ONE!
</p>

<p>
	Everyone is the only being in the universe. It's like a massively multiplayer online game where one central server runs all the players. God's mind has fractured itself into a trillion pieces. Or it imagines it has. In truth, nothing is fractured because the distinction between fractured vs whole must itself collapse, leaving behind Absolute Unity. A Unity which has no opposite. The human mind cannot imagine such a Unity because it is too total to allow for a finite mind to exist in it. Within this Absolute Unity there is no difference between your human body, a chair, a kangaroo, a taco, or anything else. All of it blends into ONE. This is the Godhead. This is what you were before you were born as a human self.

<title>Aren't psychedelics the proof that reality must be at least PARTIALLY physical?</title>

<p>
	Psychedelics are of course imaginary, just like everything else.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15239-nivsch/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="15239" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15239-nivsch/" rel="">@Nivsch</a> It doesn't make sense to you precisely because your worldview assumes there is an external physical reality. Once you drop that assumption, all the sudden psychedelics cease being physical objects and all of your objections fall away.
</p>

<p>
	My claim is not that everything is a hallucination except psychedelics. My claim is that everything is a hallucination, including psychedelics. Which means, when you eat a mushroom, you're not actually eating a physical substance, you're hallucinating eating a mushroom.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between a mushroom, a chair, a house, a tree, your body, your Mom, or Santa Claus. All of them are just different kinds of imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Taking psychedelics helps you to realize this. Yes, it's strange-loopy and paradoxical. As it must be since everything is ONE.
</p>

<p>
	So go hallucinate eating some mushrooms <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<title>why Alan Watts, sri ramana maharshi,jesus,buddha did not talked about aliens?</title>

<p>
	Mystical traditions all around the world have talked about intelligent non-human beings since the dawn of time.
</p>

<p>
	You just don't want to take them seriously because you've confused the limits of your tiny personal experience for the limits of the universe.
</p>

<p>
	Talk about aliens is very distracting because its gets the ego all defensive and dogmatic, driving it deeper into the materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The surest way to tank your credibility as a teacher is to talk about aliens. You will instantly lose 90% of your audience and be branded a crackpot cult leader. People will laugh at you and call you names. In olden times you would certainly have been burned at the stake for witchcraft and heresy.
</p>

<p>
	That's how closed minds behave.
</p>

If you are a student of nonduality you should know by now that nonduality means oneness.
</p>

<p>
	How can you pursue oneness while maintaining the notion of twoness (self vs other)?
</p>

<p>
	You are not conscious yet of the implications of ONENESS.
</p>

<p>
	It means... you know... that everything is ONE!
</p>

<p>
	Which means you are the only being in the universe.
</p>

<p>
	This does not contradict Rupert Spira. You're just not understanding yet the full implications of Spira's teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse oneness or nondualty with solipsism. Solipsism is not radical enough to be true. And yet, you are all alone.
</p>

<p>
	Technically, the duality between aloneness vs togetherness collapses. But when this happens your ego will perceive it as solipsism. If you're not careful you will reject/deny this important insight of God's existential aloneness because you are so attached to the idea of there being others.
</p>

<p>
	Dating and relationships are predicated upon manipulation.
</p>

<p>
	But pickup takes it to the next level.
</p>

<p>
	You can do pickup, the biggest thing to avoid there is the ideology which often comes with the activity.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is not so much that guys do pickup, it's that they develop a toxic masculine ideology to go with it.

<p>
	The problem with your reasoning is that it assumes a distinction between self/other, which is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	What dies is the thing you imagined was real -- self or other. But that wasn't a real thing, it was an imagined boundary.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if the imaginary boundary between America and Canada stopped being imagined by all human minds, then America and Canada would both "die". But of course in truth nothing has died because it wasn't real to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	Things "die" when they stopped being imagined.
</p>

<p>
	Which means: if you stop imagining yourself, you will die.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	RSD is enormously manipulative at multiple levels.
</p>

<p>
	Of course manipulation is often critical for survival (which is mostly what you're doing).
</p>

<p>
	The point is to become more conscious of what manipulation is, why you feel the need to do it, and karma/suffering which results from it.
</p>

<p>
	You have a lot of work yet to do to understand the depth of what manipulation is and how much suffering it causes in your life.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with manipulation is not that you're being bad towards other people, per se, but that it's like pissing into the wind. It comes back in your face in ways you're not conscious of yet. Manipulation is not a satisfying way to live. When you manipulate you are selling your soul to the devil for a piece of chocolate cake. Yes, the cake tastes good, but at what long-term cost?

<title>Free-rider problem</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/40618-free-rider-problem/?do=findComment&amp;comment=509087</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The solution to the free-rider problem is to adopt an abundance mindset.
</p>

<p>
	If you are confident in your skills and the value you add to society you don't need to worry about a few poor people enjoying some crumbs that fall off your table.
</p>

<p>
	The free-rider argument is advanced by people with a scarcity mindset who fear that there won't be enough to go around. The truth is that there are enough resources on this planet for every human to be comfortable. If only those resources were shared fairly and not hoarded.
</p>

<p>
	The free-rider problem is also seriously overblown. It's not like the government will supply you with a comfortable living while you sit around and play video games your whole life. People on food stamps and welfare programs are not automatically bums. Many of them are hardworking people.
</p>

<p>
	The true free-rider problem is the free-riding that corporations do when they lobby and corrupt government to get tax-breaks, cushy government contracts, wars, subsidies, and less regulation.
</p>

<p>
	If aliens became a commonly recognized thing, humans would develop a much stronger human species identity which would contrast itself against the aliens. Then at some point there would need to be unification of the alien and human identities. The humans and aliens would start to have sex with each other, and so on. At first this would be hated and even outlawed. But then it would become normal and even desirable.
</p>

<p>
	The movie Avatar touches on this issue.

<p>
	It's a good vision but also you underestimate the importance of non-psychedelic work. Laying the right theoretical foundation in people's minds is crucial for psychedelics to be effective.
</p>

<p>
	Also remember that people below stage Green will vehemently resist and misinterpret psychedelic insights.
</p>

<p>
	The problem of awakening mankind is much more challenging than simply giving psychedelics to ignorant people.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The opposite is true. The greatest creativity comes from blending of various cultures. Diversity leads to creativity. Insular communities are incestuous and narrow. It's like inter-breeding within your own family. Your genetic diversity will be low.
</p>

<p>
	It has been shown that major cities are far more creatively productive than small villages. Why? Because of the diverse cross-pollination of cultures, people, and ideas. Preventing the rise of big cities by isolating everyone into mono-cultural villages is regressive and anti-evolutionary. The rise of consciousness requires higher orders of complexity, diversity, and unity.
</p>

<p>
	Diversity does not mean destroying individual cultures. It just means appreciating their diversity, allowing it to flourish and cross-pollinate.
</p>

<p>
	The blending of American and Chinese culture will produce something much greater than isolating American and Chinese cultures into their own corners.

	</div>

<p>
	Yes it does. It's a unified global culture which appreciates and respects individual sub-cultures. It's just not the old culture you're used to. It's a new meta-culture.
</p>

<p>
	It's not different than unifying a bunch of cities into one country. The cities still maintain their individuality but also function better together under one banner. This creates peace between cities where there would otherwise be war. Without a unification NYC might want to nuke LA.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise, without a global unification one culture will want to dominate and destroy others.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	You're making a case for nationalism, which is a very dangerous ideology.
</p>

<p>
	Globalism respects all cultures without needing one culture to be the best. Of course there are some trade-offs when unifying any set of diverse things, but overall the costs are worth it. Under globalism you are allowed to practice your favorite religion, eat your favorite food, wear your favorite clothes, have your favorite kind of sex, without being harassed for it.
</p>

<p>
	Every culture grows, evolves, and dies. So you can't preserve them no more than you can preserve 80's technology.

<p>
	If all you have of spirituality is theory, you aren't really doing spirituality.

<p>
	Be careful to distinguish theory vs consciousness. They are not at all the same thing.

<p>
	Freebase is about 5mg more potent than HCl.
</p>

<p>
	My numbers are ambiguous since 5mg is not a big difference. Tolerance is a much bigger factor.

Increasing by 1mg is too anal. Up it by 5mg each time. Then you should hit a breakthrough soon.
</p>

<p>
	It's totally normal to require 40-45mg when plugging.
</p>

<p>
	The range is between 15mg to 45mg, depending a lot on your tolerance which seems to be genetically determined.
</p>

<p>
	Since you've already broken through via smoking, you should have no trouble with 40mg-45mg plugged. The plugged breakthrough will be much gentler (but still epic).

	Canada's one of the best places right now for research chemicals.
</p>

<p>
	Costa rica is also an interesting option. They do a lot of ayahuasca and ibogaine down there. They probably allow toads too (not sure).
</p>

<p>
	Spain and Portugal have decriminalized all drugs. Which doesn't mean you can just buy them at the local store. But still far better than most countries.

<p>
	I agree. Every incel should do psychedelics. Just like the founder of AA did to cure himself.
</p>

<p>
	AA for incels is otherwise known as the pickup community. The problem with alcoholics though is that they refuse to go to AA and do what AA teaches them. Incels have built up an entire victim ideology about why they will never be able to get girls and how it's someone else's fault.
</p>

<p>
	So in this sense Actualized.org is AA for incels. Because what incels need most is tools for combating their own toxic epistemology.
</p>

<p>
	This problem is really not much different than the problem of deprogramming terrorists, cult members, and materialist scientists. Each is lost in his own kind of paradigm locked ideology but is in denial about it and keeps himself busy by projecting it out onto the world.
</p>

<p>
	I'll make a video for incels in the future.

<p>
	You are NOT a passive observer of reality. You are The Creator.
</p>

<p>
	What do you want to create? << that's the crucial question.
</p>

<p>
	If you decide to live in your Mom's basement and eat Cheetos all day, that's what you've chosen to create whether you realize it or not. Don't squander your creative capacity.

	Trump's just a classic narccist and con artist.
</p>

<p>
	Most people don't have personal experiences with such people. But once you've hung around a person like this you learn how they work and they become very predictable. Their whole life revolves around shameless manipulation and opportunism. Eventually it leads to their downfall and hurts everyone close to them.

	It's funny how a giant ego looks like mental illness.

<p>
	All egos behave like Trump. It's just a question of degree.

<p>
	The catch is, you have to die in the process.

<p>
	The catch is, you will resist awakening even if it's in pill form.

	Rahter than concept, think of things as being imaginary. The past is imaginary. There never was a Newton so to speak unless you imagine him right now.
</p>

<p>
	So what Newton is, is what you think he is right now.

</p>

<p>
	So in your desire to eliminate evil you end up creating it.
</p>

<p>
	Thus you are a devil.
</p>

<p>
	See how sneaky the devil is?

<p>
	Yup

	Evil only holds relative to you clinging to some form. If you are indifferent about how form changes, you cannot know evil. Evil becomes unthinkable.

			I even do this now with animals, I can't even really help it. The other day I caught a mouse in a catch and release trap and I felt like what it should be like to be stuck in there, when I released him into a field I pictured myself being that mouse running off being relieved to be free but also scared about being alone out there and away from its family now. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a good sign of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But also what must be integrated and accepted is that if the mouse is killed, that too is oneness and love. If you fail to integrate that then you will not be able to love those who do evil.
</p>

<p>
	It is not enough to not do evil oneself. You must realize that even if you stop committing evil personally, you will still commit evil as others. But since self = other, it makes no sense to judge other since you are just judging yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps the hardest thing to accept is the inevitability of evil.
</p>

<p>
	For example, next time, kill the mouse and accept your own evil for what it is. Can you love evil? That is the true test of your realization of oneness. After all, if everything is one, then love and evil must be one.

<p>
	Yes, exactly. Everything is imaginary. So what is left to worry about?
</p>

<p>
	Truth isn't yet another object you hallucinate. Truth is the realization that there is nothing outside of hallucination. It's a meta-thing.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is an absolute, which means you don't have to worry about doubting it. Truth is what remains after you've doubted everything to death.

	There is some correlation but it's not a serious problem, like you think hearing about God will make you hallucinate God.

	Hehehe... No! That's a silly fear. Do you worry that hearing about the sun will cause you to hallucinate a sun?

<p>
	Letting go is the easiest thing in the world. Just let go.
</p>

<p>
	Start by letting go of your worries of letting go. See Sedona Method for more.

			And in your, opinion would you work exclusively with 5-meo for a while and explore the substance without using other psychedelics, since it seems to affect the sensitivity to other psychedelics? Or did you find it beneficial to use other substances as well, while start working with 5-meo-DMT?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Either way is fine.
</p>

<p>
	I find other psychedelics useful as they show you more angles and flavors of consciousness. They can also help with integration. And then you appreciate 5-MeO-DMT all the more.

<p>
	Great work! You realized a lot of important facets in that one trip. Keep at it.
</p>

<p>
	Other psychedelics can have less body load than LSD analogues. So experiment to find which one works best with your body.

</p>

<p>
	Every moment exists in the mind of God forever. Nothing is ever lost to time because time itself is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Think of reality like an infinite film reel sitting on a shelf. All the frames exist at once. That reel contains every film that could ever exist. It doesn't matter which frame you're on right now.
</p>

<p>
	That's Absolute Infinity.

	It doesn't really matter what you are told about the facet because when you realize it, it will strike you out of the blue. It will still be a total shock. No words can prepare you for how radical it is.

	Only in hindsight will you realize: "Oh! So that's what Leo was talking about!"

	Zen is a hyper-macho old-school Japanese tradition. And Stage Blue isn't known for its light-heartedness.

<p>
	You should get in the habit of asking any girl you're flirting with, "By the way, are you single?"
</p>

<p>
	One of my fave questions to ask early on. If she says no, move on to another girl. This will save you a lot of wasted effort.
</p>

	Your mistake was vaping it when you should have plugged it.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is a lot more gentle and smooth. Yet still incredibly powerful.

<p>
	If it's an easy to use consumer device, it's not going to be good. Those are more like toys, not serious meditation aids.

Stuff like that.
</p>

<p>
	You can also train up using something like a Flesh Light.

	I've done it before. Not worth it. Mostly a waste of time and brings bad karma.
</p>

<p>
	Most girls will not cheat on their bf/husband. Some will, but is that really the kind of girl you want?
</p>

<p>
	There are plenty of single girls around. Focus on win-win arrangements.
</p>
