<p>
	I've never had any knee pain in my life.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out for your fantasies, assumptions, and projections about me.
</p>

<p>
	Best not to talk about someone you don't know as if you know him.
</p>

<p>
	And it's a bad idea to do things on people without their permission.
</p>

<p>
	Be care with the New Age rabbit hole. It contains lots of potential for self-deception and delusion in the name of spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Which is not to say Reiki doesn't work. Just don't get carried away into fantasy-land about it.

<title>Is consciousness more than just sensory perception?</title>

Pure consciousness is not a thing. It is blank, void, nothing. It is like the hole in your coffee cup. You're asking: "Can a pure hole exist without a coffee cup?" Yes, except it is then no longer a hole as you've always thought of it. It is just infinite emptiness.

<title>The ABSOLUTE can be known by ITs Qualities</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/27531-the-absolute-can-be-known-by-its-qualities/?do=findComment&amp;comment=313630</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The Absolute has no qualities, which is identical to it having all qualities.
</p>

<p>
	All qualities are qualities of the Absolute. So literally any quality you can think of is a quality of the Absolute. Which is precisely why nothing can be said of the Absolute because to say it has one quality but not another is to misrepresent it.
</p>

<p>
	It is infinite, finite, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	It is small, big, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	It is eternal, temporal, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	And so on down the line.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind cannot hold all of these qualities at once. For that, you would have to exit the mind and literally become the entire universe. Which is possible, but not within the realm of speech or conventional "knowledge." You'd have to leave those behind.
</p>

<p>
	That's gonna be true of most work environments. The search for Truth is the opposite of doing everyday work.
</p>

<p>
	Even the work I do for Actualized.org is counter-productive for seeking Truth. In fact, very much so. Because work is just not about that. Work is a survival function, which is the opposite of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem I see with programming is that it consigns you to sit at a computer terminal for 8 hours per day for 40 years. But then again, lots of work does that these days. I spend much of my time on a computer. So....

			So for example, I would actually have my own understanding of the terms you mention above. I don't know if I would be using those terms in the way that you would use them, but as far as I'm concerned they all wrap up into the One Realization. God is the Self. Absolute Infinity is the Self. Infinite Love is the Self. There are no others besides the Self. Infinite Intelligence and Nirvana are the Self.

<p>
	Have you had the following realizations:

<ul>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		Absolute Infinity
	</li>
	<li>
		Infinite Love
	</li>

	<li>
		Nirvana
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These facets can be part of an enlightenment, or not.

<p>
	All fear is fear of losing one's self/identity.
</p>

<p>
	So of course people fear intimacy & deep union with others. Other is the very thing you need to differentiate yourself from in order to be a self.
</p>

<p>
	Self/other is the ultimate conceptual duality which birthed you into existence.
</p>

<p>
	You were literally born the moment you thought: "self here, other there." And you've been under this delusion for your entire life.
</p>

<p>
	Stop running away from feeling emotions. Do the opposite and push yourself to feel more deeply. The purpose of being alive is to FEEL everything! Stop being picky about where it feels good or bad. Just fucking FEEL! Make it your mission to feel the shit out of everything regardless of what it is.
</p>

<p>
	God also DOES have a body. Your body, and every body that has every existed for every creature. Those are all literally God's body.
</p>

<p>
	God is a shapeshifter, a thing which inhabits infinite forms. Which is why God is difficult for people to see. They keep looking for God as one concrete thing, this or that, but God is ALL THINGS!
</p>

<p>
	The hardest thing to see is that which is everywhere you look and the eyes with which you are looking.

</p>

<p>
	You certainly don't have to know about kundalini or actively try to awaken it to become enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	I would distinguish between activated kundalini and enlightenment. You can have one or the other or both or neither.
</p>

<title>Teal Swan on human connection being the way to Enlightenment?</title>

<p>
	It's very very unlikely to make you enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 requirement for enlightenment is laser focus for hours on end.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why the most enlightened sages were hermits and recluses. "Human stuff" is a giant distraction.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing wrong with building deep relationships, but it will get you mired deep in human stuff when you want to be delving into metaphysical stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You can also do both, by scheduling 10-day solo retreats throughout the year. This way you can have relationships without going full-monk, but you can also get some of that monk experience. This is probably the ideal for most people, unless you're really drawn to go full-monk.
</p>

<p>
	Anyhow, all those humans are none other than yourself. There is no one here but you. God is forever alone.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, unless someone told you stages of development are a thing, you would never know about them no matter how enlightened you got.
</p>

<p>
	You will never encounter a developmental stage during meditation.

And it does not happen automagically.
</p>

<p>
	We develop ourselves only if we do.

<p>
	Development does not imply an I.

</p>

<p>
	Don't try to be too cozy with your family. Go create your own life.
</p>

<p>
	If your family will disown you for dating someone you love, fuck them. They don't really love you then.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to hate them. Just create some distance. You have the right to live however you want.

	The distinction is very simple:
</p>

<p>
	Addictive, yes or no?
</p>

<p>
	If yes, do not use.
</p>

<p>
	I do not condone caffeine for this reason. I would never recommend an addictive or harmful substance like ketamine, antidepressants, or opioids.

<p>
	Western values aren't superior. You can reach high stages of the Spiral under different value systems.
</p>

<p>
	There can be stage Turquoise Islam or Hinduism or Japanese values.
</p>

<p>
	To think that Western culture is superior to Hindu culture is brazenly ignorant and self-biased. A person could only hold that position because they have not studied Hindu culture. Hindu culture is extremely advanced in certain ways, like spiritually.
</p>

<p>
	A 6th grader is not superior to a 2nd grader. They are just at different levels of growth. One had a head start. Don't mistake that for superiority.
</p>

<p>
	All superiority is relative anyways. Superior according to who? Superior towards what end?
</p>

<p>
	You can't really talk someone out of ignorance. They must outgrow it by experiencing new perspectives and experiences which shatter their limited enthocentric worldview.
</p>

<p>
	A great way to become Green is through travel to exotic non-Western countries. Watch some Anthony Bourdain.

	You are treating it as a means to another end, while I am talking about being a bricklayer as its own end.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine you laid bricks for the rest of your life. Not to advance to some other position, but just because you loved the art of laying bricks.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously bricklaying is not YOUR LP since you want to do big picture stuff, but that is not clear for OP.

<p>
	In practice Orange is still not far enough out of Blue. Orange will have a sense of superiority and insensitivity.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the US Constitution was a stage Orange document crafted by stage Orange elites, but it still tolerated slavery.
</p>

<p>
	Folks like Sam Harris or JP still hold a sort of sense of "Western culture and values are superior" which is not quite racism, but it is still a subtle sense of superiority and self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	Orange still doesn't grasp the full extent of relativity. Orange still believes in objective external truths. As if there is one way the world is.

</p>

<p>
	Even 150ug can kick your ass. So watch out.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds to me like you're asking for a bad trip because your attitude towards this substance is way too light.
</p>

<p>
	300ug outdoors can go really wrong. This doesn't mean it will go wrong every time, but it certainly CAN go very wrong unless you are extremely careful and know what you are doing. If you do it a dozen times, I can almost guarantee something will go wrong. So watch out. You are playing with a loaded gun.

You can become conscious of pretty much anything permanently.
</p>

<p>
	But it will take a lot of focused work in most cases.
</p>

<p>
	Of course your neurology will be a limit a lot of times, but you can change your neurology both through external and internal means (like psychedelics and diet or yoga and long meditation sits).

	The point is that spiritual practice of any kind rewires your brain. Psychedelics and meditation ultimately do the same thing, one is just more short-acting while the other is more long-acting.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are also more powerful because they can change your neurology is crazy ways, but the effects are rarely permanent (which is actually a good thing) otherwise you could really damage yourself with a bad trip.

Eventually you will break through. There's not much of a trick to it other than brute force.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help enormously with this issue.
</p>

<p>
	Once you've died a few times, death stops being a big deal. The ego just goes quietly. But not at first. At first it makes a big drama out of it.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually you will discover that all fear is illusion. Especially the fear of death.

<title>Contemplating the side effects of being a coder</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/27455-contemplating-the-side-effects-of-being-a-coder/?do=findComment&amp;comment=312689</link>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13086-1x0/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13086" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13086-1x0/" rel="">@1x0</a> That's right, there is a trade-off between being a technician versus being a big picture thinker.
</p>

<p>
	Project leads do very little actual coding. So you have to decide what you want out of life: Do you love coding so much that you want to be a master hands-on coder, or do you love other things more, like management, big picture thinking, business strategy, etc? In that case, you must surrender your desire for hands-on coding.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of the difference between being a bricklayer and an architect. If you love to lay bricks you shouldn't become an architect.
</p>

<p>
	There is no right or wrong answer. It is perfectly acceptable to just enjoy the art and science of coding or bricklaying. It's not always better to be a project lead. You can just be a master coder. Then again, coding can be quite dehumanizing and a waste of life. Do you really want to be sitting behind a computer screen for 12 hours per day? Is there something more fun and valuable that you could be doing? Does the world really need another code monkey? Or could your creative talents be put to better use?
</p>

<p>
	But it's not just about getting more money for your time. You must enjoy the thing you're doing. So if coding is what you genuinely most enjoy, then do that. The trick is, there are probably other things you enjoy more but haven't discovered yet. So then your task would be to discover that.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I don't enjoy management so I avoid positions where I have to manage lots of people. I would rather be working independently, doing my art. But that's me. Some people love to work in groups and manage others. It all depends on your personality type.
</p>

<title>Meditation styles effective for ADD</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Psychedelics + Nootropics + Kriya yoga
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is very effective at shutting down the monkey mind through brute physical force.
</p>

<p>
	Also, if you have the money, EEG neurofeedback training. You can find a center near you that offers hourly sessions. It's great for ADD. Just 5 to 15 sessions can make a lasting impact.
</p>

<title>Looking For PHP Web Developer</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I'm looking for a fairly experienced web developer with good working knowledge of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. And as a bonus, experience with Wordpress backend, shopping carts, and Paypal backend integration would be really nice.
</p>

<p>
	I have a few improvements that I want made to the Actualized.org website, like an improved search function, and we need to create a registration page for the upcoming Actualized tour -- which needs to be hooked up to Paypal payment processing and a custom database -- and some other additions to the shopping cart.
</p>

<p>
	This would be a part-time, semi-paid volunteer gig. You could add Actualized.org to your resume/portfolio. I could also give you free access to all current & future Actualized products/courses, or maybe even some one-on-one life coaching if you want.
</p>

<p>
	PM me if you're interested. Let me know what kind of experience you have and where you are located. I only need one person.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks!
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not impossible.
</p>

<p>
	That's where spiritual work is needed.
</p>

<p>
	Being is far superior to meaning. The pursuit of meaning never satisfies because it's like a donkey moving towards a carrot on stick that it will never ever reach.
</p>

<p>
	This is very important for you to grok if you ever want to be truly happy.
</p>

<p>
	JP's ideology will NEVER lead to happiness. And you can tell it makes him miserable. It's visible in his demeanor. Compare him, say, to someone like Eckhart Tolle or Sadhguru and you can see the vast difference.
</p>

Suffering actually comes from the construction and chasing of meaning. Because in the end the Truth will win out and all meaning will be rendered meaningless. Because in Truth, being is meaningless.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful not to fall into the naive trap of assigning negative meaning to meaninglessness.
</p>

<p>
	JP is deluded, and if you keep listening to him he will infect you with his gross misunderstandings of reality.
</p>

<p>
	It is fine to pursue meaning in a relative sense as long as you understand that all meaning is just a game that you are playing to amuse yourself. You cannot take meaning or value seriously, otherwise you will suffer greatly and become deluded.
</p>

<p>
	For example I pursue meaning by doing my work. But I also understand that my work is ultimately meaningless and that it's just done for fun. I don't take it too seriously.
</p>

<p>
	One of the things you should immediately notice about JP is that he takes himself way too seriously. And you better believe this causes him great suffering. You don't want to be JP.
</p>

<p>
	Value & meaning are the survival mechanism of the ego.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, meaning & value are relative. Which means you can literally make it anything you want to be. It's imagination and fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Guys, enough of this stupid question/response.
</p>

<p>
	You have to speak to people at their level. Just telling some newbie "Who is doing X?" when the person is clearly not in a position to understand what you mean is the very definition of unskillful means.
</p>

<p>
	A teaching only works when the other person is at a place where they will get it.

</p>

<p>
	The cure for bad trips is 1) Learn the lesson it was trying to teach you, 2) Let a few months pass, 3) Then try a different substance to clean your palette.
</p>

<p>
	Only then return to the original substance.
</p>

<p>
	By this point your trip will go very differently. You will be much more mature.

<p>
	Regardless, Kavanaugh is definitely a liar and an ideologue. Which should be enough to disqualify him from a Supreme Court position.
</p>

<p>
	It would be good if no partisan or ideologue was ever allowed to even apply for that job. The most important requirement for a judge is to be non-biased. That judges are liberal or conservative is silly. Judges must be neutral and openminded. But of course, that would de facto make them rather liberal, which conservatives would never abide.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is that openmindedness is not acceptable to conservatives. Their entire philosophy is based on closedmindedness. Which is why self-actualization and conservativism are like oil and water and not just my personal political bias. Conservatives are neurologically wired to be more closedminded, as studies seem to show. Which doesn't mean they are always wrong but let's just say they fall more on the losing side of history, like dodo birds.

<p>
	As Socrates famously said, "I know that I know nothing."
</p>

<p>
	That's enlightenment in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
	But it's still not what you imagine it to be. By knowing nothing you know everything. Things go full-circle in an unexpected way.
</p>

<p>
	You should also distinguish carefully between absolute vs relative knowing. We are talking about knowledge of the Absolute Truth in this context. Relative knowledge abounds, but it is relative.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute knowledge isn't really knowledge, it's Being. But we colloquially call it "knowledge" because most people do not understand a word like "being".
</p>

	If TRUTH was so easily enjoyable, every fool would have found it by now. The trick is precisely that the greatest joy lies behind a veil of your greatest fears: death & insanity. You must have enough wisdom and vision to confront your greatest fears, intuiting that they are merely paper tigers.
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to realize God without dying.
</p>

<p>
	A bigger dose of psychedelics helps here. A dose so big that you have no choice but to surrender. But not so big that you physically harm yourself.

	Time is relative. Everything exists simultaneously from a high enough elevation.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, every experience exists eternally, forever. Including this one right now. Here it is! Eternal!
</p>

<p>
	But you're stuck in relativity so you aren't aware of the eternity. See, that's what happens when your mind gets attached to particular forms.

<p>
	Of course Spinoza knew what's up.
</p>

<p>
	He was a Western mystic. Apparently a hero of Einstein's.
</p>

<p>
	Check out Bishop George Berkeley too.

</p>

<p>
	The navel chakra stores the largest reserve of kundalini energy. Which is why the navel chakra is often stimulated only after lots of prep work -- because when it opens it could unleash a torrent.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you would get a lot of out of Kriya yoga. It should be very effective for you. Much more so than conventional meditation. Give it a try for 6 months. You could awaken just like that. It could change your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	Don't depend on other people to awaken you. Take the job into your own hands. Which is not to say never do Reiki, I just mean, seize this lucky break to awaken yourself.
</p>

<p>
	I have some books about kundalini on my book list. Make sure you educate yourself about some of the dangers of kundalini and how to awaken it gradually and properly. Otherwise you might run into problems.

<p>
	Because every trip builds on the prior. Those first few trips were merely laying the groundwork for the mindfuckery that is to come in the future.

<p>
	In the future you will experience recontextualizations so radical that you will not be able to tell if were ever born. You ain't seen nothing yet. So watch your step.

<title>Osho - Unknowable Intrinsic Reality</title>

<p>
	That is the core lesson of mysticism: reality is irreducibly mystical.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot know the Absolute because knowledge is a 2nd order process. Being is prior to knowing. You can BE the Absolute rather than knowing it. Or you can know that it is unknowable. Which is what Osho is describing.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality means that knowing must collapse into being. Which is why the ultimate Truth cannot be spoke, thought, or symbolized. All symbols are too indirect. You must directly become the being of which all symbols are made. Language and thought must be entirely transcended. The Truth is beyond thought, imagination, or even your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Ayn Rand was of course an arrogant, egoistical, dualistic, stage Orange fool. The hallmark of the ego-mind is that it thinks it can know everything through linear reason. And in this it is deluded beyond hope.

</p>

<p>
	From now on, when you trip you will do it with seriousness, good intent, focus, and no more willy-nilly stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are not a toy.
</p>

<p>
	When you take a psychedelic properly, you set aside the whole day, mentally prepare yourself, and you do it almost like a religious ceremony (minus the dogma).
</p>

<p>
	Why are you drinking during a psychedelic trip?
</p>

<p>
	Why are you tripping while tired?
</p>

<p>
	Why are you trying to avoid the trip through sleep?
</p>

<p>
	This shows sloppy protocol and disrespect for the substance.
</p>

<p>
	When you take a psychedelic you must in peak form: alert, awake, focused, sober, solemn, at peace, in a positive mood, well-rested, empty stomach, reverent, slightly apprehensive, and ready to be mindfucked.
</p>

<title>Differentiation within Pure Beingness</title>

</p>

<p>
	You are assuming there is a material difference between something and nothing, when there isn't from the absolute perspective.
</p>

<p>
	What you're calling "differentiation" is otherwise called a distinction. Distinction is NOT a concept! But concept is a distinction!
</p>

<p>
	All of reality consists of distinctions, but at the same time all distinctions are ultimately one.
</p>

<p>
	This was explained in my longest episode: Understanding Sameness vs Difference
</p>

<p>
	Pure beingness is literally nothing whether you drop your concepts or not. Nothing has ever happened. That's reality. Nothing. And everything. Because there is no difference between the two. The difference is only there in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The implications of this are not only important, it is the source of all Creation! This is how God created the entire universe!
</p>

<p>
	If you understood what a distinction was, you'd be deeply enlightened and you'd understand how the entire universe came into being. So it's worth contemplating a bit <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	P.S. You would also become immortal as the distinction between life and death would collapse.
</p>

<p>
	P.P.S. An object which lacks all distinction is Infinity. And yet at the same time this object contains within it all possible distinctions, thus comprising the sum total of reality. Nothing and Everything in one tiny/huge point. A white hole if you will.
</p>

<p>
	Democrats had a fairly strong win.
</p>

<p>
	The Senate was never really in play this term.
</p>

<p>
	Red states are still red, and they will not change much in 2 years time. Conservatives like Trump so they will not change. The only thing that really changes is independents and moderates, and they seem to be turned off by Trump, which is about as much as you can expect.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really expect deep red states to flip all of the sudden. Texas and Florida are red and will stay red for a years to come.
</p>

<p>
	From what I can see Trump will find it almost impossible to win reelection in 2020 because he has clearly lost independents and moderates. He only won thanks to them in 2016 because they did not yet realize his true character and Hillary didn't inspire anyone and had lots of baggage.
</p>

<p>
	If the Dems put up a good candidate in 2020, Trump should easily lose, assuming he even survives 2 years of criminal investigations.
</p>

<p>
	The only way Trump wins again is if the Dems put up a terrible, uninspiring candidate. (Which they could manage to do.)
</p>

<p>
	If the Dems put up someone like Sanders, Warren, or Beto, Trump should lose.
</p>

<p>
	If they put up Biden...

<p>
	You will get more out of the trip with eyes open. Otherwise it will tend to devolve into just another dream.

	The point is to let the psychedelic transform your everyday perceptions. So keep your room as it is. Don't make it dark or special.

	Free food from source? Lol

<p>
	You mean murder.

	You can do that as a human too. But be careful what you wish for.

<p>
	Why do you have no problem with source needing you to spend thousands of $$$ to feed it self?
</p>

<p>
	By your logic shouldn't God hand out free slices of pizza to homeless people? And while we're at it why not a free Rolls Royce too? After all, source wouldn't want people to have to get places using their legs. That might produce blisters. And everyone knows driving a Kia is just embarrassing.

	Shakipat is a classic awakening method. But it's not gonna work on everyone and like all methods it has its pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you can shortcut the hard work of inner development, you'll probably be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that awakening ain't development, and development ain't awakening.

I understand that you may not want to rely on random forum people, but very least, I could help come up with and organize a suitable venue, if it ever comes to the European tour and you consider my city :).

<p>
	Maybe, we'll have to see. The trick with doing these tours is that things have to be reliable and timely. It can't be like, "I was gonna help you but then my cat died."

<p>
	What you presently are, is already God. You just need to realize that this is so. That is enlightenment.

<p>
	Enlightenment will be the death of "you". After that, there is nothing left to die.

</p>

<p>
	The ticket price makes up only a portion of the total of the travel expenses. And for this tour, the tickets have to be at specific hours. Budget red-eye flights with long layovers will not work. I can't arrive dead tired. I have to be fresh enough to speak and lead a group.

</p>

<p>
	What you're looking for is nonduality. Or maybe some kind of meditative yoga center. Not Hatha yoga but serious Indian meditative yoga like Kundalini yoga, Kriya yoga, etc.
</p>

<p>
	In Vegas we have a pretty good Indian yoga center. But that will vary a lot city to city.
</p>

<p>
	Usually you have to travel to find good nondual teachers. Isn't Rupert Spira in the UK? That might be your best bet. I've traveled to far away places to seek out the best teachers. It is worth it.
</p>

<p>
	In the old days folks would fly to India.
</p>

<p>
	Also Sadhguru has yoga initiations in London I'm sure. Maybe even Ireland.

<p>
	Fairly soon. The first meet would be within 1-2 months. Perhaps early December before the holiday rush. Possibly even November 30th. But no sooner than that because I want to give people plenty of time to know about it.

<p>
	That's a good question. I imagine my talks will be in the vein of Actualized.org videos. With some new helpful in-person group exercises which would be focused on raising general consciousness & self awareness. This would be useful for all people across the board, basically delving you into consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	I don't think we'd directly work on life purpose, but consciousness work will help with all your goals, from career to relationships to spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	We would probably be exploring topics like emotional mastery, fear, judgment, confidence, self-esteem, self-deception, spirituality, meditation techniques, body awareness, nonduality, shadow work, motivation, getting unstuck, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The dates will be set and announced long ahead of time so that people can be mobilized to sign up.
</p>

<p>
	You would have to sign up online and submit payment ($30) to reserve your spot. Otherwise many people will flake. And also because I need to know how big of a meeting room to book. Every room has a max occupancy which is commonly 15, 20, 30, or 40 people.
</p>

<p>
	If I'm flying out there, you gotta show up. It costs at least $500-$700 to fly out to even nearby cities.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot invalidate Truth. That's the trick!
</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Nothing the materialist can do will undermined nonduality. In fact, the entire universe could explode tomorrow and nonduality would still hold.
</p>

<p>
	That's the value of nonduality. It's FOREVER! If it could be undermined by some silly materialist's scientific discovery it wouldn't be worth talking about.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot apply relativistic standards of falsification to the Absolute!
</p>

<p>
	You can discover the Absolute for yourself. But you cannot ever falsify it. Because it is true, absolutely.

<p>
	So I've decided to give this tour a shot. The details are still yet to be determined but tentatively I'm hoping to visit about 10 cities in the next year around the US.
</p>

<p>
	This tour would happen in 3 phases:
</p>

<p>
	Phase #1: Los Angeles, San Fran, Seattle<br />
	Phase #2: Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago, NY<br />
	Phase #3: Austin, Atlanta, Miami
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps not in exactly that order, but something akin to that. We will adjust cities based on demand. But Phase #1 seems fairly certain to happen in that order.
</p>

<p>
	It would work as follows:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I would fly into the city on Friday
	</li>
	<li>
		Around 6-7pm on Friday we would meet in a hotel conference room where I would give a talk on some new topic followed by some group exercises and Q&A.
	</li>
	<li>
		This would all last about 2-3 hrs long in total, with about 10-30 people attending (depending on demand).
	</li>
	<li>
		This would perhaps be followed by a dinner at a local eatery, depending on crowd size. Probably limited to 10 people max as it gets unwieldy with a party over 10.
	</li>
	<li>
		Cost: estimated around $30/person
	</li>
	<li>
		Cost of attending dinner: some amount just to keep the group to 10 max + you pay for your dinner
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I would visit at least 1 city per month, maybe as much as 1 city every 2 weeks. The schedule would vary to avoid conflict with holidays but the meetings would be held on Friday evenings.
</p>

<p>
	Locations outside USA are too cost and time prohibitive right now. Europe might be possible if and when Phase #3 is successfully completed, but that's too early to talk about yet.
</p>

<p>
	I'm doing this in phases because I have no idea yet how many people would show up in which cities. If fewer than 10, it's not really worth doing due to the expenses of travel, hotel, meeting room, car, and time. 10-30 would be ideal for now. More than 30 requires larger, more expensive meeting rooms but I doubt we'll have this problem at this stage.
</p>

<p>
	If there is interest I might also design a one-day mini-workshop which I would teach on the following day: Saturday. With the idea being that if you like the Friday talk and you want to do a more in-depth training the following day, that might cost $100-$200 for let's say a 4-hour training. This extra mini-workshop day would help cover my costs of travel and it would be a good learning experience for you. But for the mini-workshop to be practical there would have to be at least 5 people paying. Otherwise it's not worth the hassle.
</p>

<p>
	The trick in planning this out is that I have no idea how many people would be interested in this in each of the above cities, let alone show up. The only way to find out is to actually schedule the dates and do it. So I will probably be making concrete plans shortly for Los Angeles, San Fran, & Seattle. After those 3 are complete we could assess how things went, make improvements, and schedule new cities. Or, if not enough people show up, then Phase #1 will be the end of this experiment.
</p>

<p>
	Let me know what ya'll think.
</p>

<p>
	This would probably only work if those who want to attend can convince 1 or 2 friends to come as well.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest benefits of these meet ups would be the ability to network and make friends with self-actualizers in your city. So you don't just get to meet me, but you get to make some new local friends who are into this work who you can hang out with for years to come.
</p>

<p>
	I'm excited to do some talking and socializing in the non-digital realm <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

			Does Leo take all of the nootropics mentioned in his video simultaneously? Like at any one time, how many nootropics is it appropriate to be on? Are there any long term benefits to modafanil/armodafanil? Or are these two drugs only good for the period of time that you are on them?

<p>
	It's certainly possible to take 20 pills at once. I don't do that every day but some days I do. Depends on what I'm planning to do and what I'm in the mood for. Most days I take a smaller batch of like 6-10 essential pills. As you experiment you will discover which ones are most essential for you.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if I'm going to be doing a long day of creative intellectual work I might take the full 20 pill stack. But for most days that's overkill. I'm not gonna take that on a weekend when I'm just chilling.

This you will do for years. And at the same time you want to have 2-4 things you are working on in your life using the various techniques and practices we talk about.
</p>

<p>
	Like meditation, contemplation, psychedelics, journaling, working on your career, working on your diet, visualization, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Start with those things which are giving you the most problem, which are keeping you stuck the most.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to do everything at once. Come up with a list of your priorities. Something like: #1 career, #2 diet, #3 relationships, or whatever. It's hard to do personal dev in the abstract. You need to have some concrete goals that you're working towards, whether it's getting a girlfriend or starting a profitable biz or having your first mystical experience. Those are all concrete goals you can work towards every day using various practices.
</p>

<p>
	What are the top 3 ways in which you want to change your life? Start there.
