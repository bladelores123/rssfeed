The problem is no serious person wants to accept it.
</p>

<p>
	Science is not about to admit that their entire materialist framework is a house of cards.
</p>

<p>
	You may as well be asking the Catholic Church to admit it's full of shit. It's not going to do that! Collective ego doesn't give a fuck about truth, it cares about self-preservation.
</p>

<p>
	You accept science as though it were the word of God without realizing that in reality it's just a giant corrupt bureaucracy run by conservative old men who have children to feed and reputations to maintain. Same as the church.
</p>

<p>
	Wake up!
</p>

<p>
	Notice, the only reason you have scientific truths in your head at all is because it has been told to you by some old man in a position of power, whom you gullibly believed. If an old man in a position of power does not tell you it, how the hell will you ever know about it?? Through YT ads? Through CNN? Through Facebook? Where are you getting your information? Have you realized yet that all mainstream sources of information are propaganda channels for the collective stage Orange ego? You've lived inside an Orange echo-chamber your whole life! You are like a factory cow that's never seen real grass or sunshine a day in your life. If you ever met a real cow who told you about grass and sunshine, you'd think that cow was crazy. But of course the crazy one is you.

People like you usually become psychics or they represses that part of themselves and keep it secret.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you've got some natural paranormal talent and you could easily develop it using books, courses, workshops, and teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Read more New Age books and you'll get into that whole paranormal sub-field of the self-help market.

Focus is a general skill. If you can focus on one thing, you can focus on another. And if you can't focus, you can't focus on anything. The mind jumps around and it makes excuses for why it's good to jump around. Which is why you have not settled on a concentration target. The mind just does not want to.

Remote viewing is NEVER a 100% certain phenomena and it does not work the way materialists want it to work. It is probablisitic and hazy.
</p>

<p>
	You're missing the depth of this problem: no amount of evidence can convince a closed mind. Period.
</p>

<p>
	You can teach yourself astral projection. Bunch of how-to books available for it. It is a settled matter for those who care to know it. The only people who doubt it are the ones who are closedminded and inexperienced.

</p>

<p>
	A) It ain't easy. Takes lots of practice.
</p>

<p>
	B) Start small. 60 mins is too long. You need quality, not quantity. Try doing 5 minutes of laser focused concentration, like a hawk. Do that for a whole month, then move up to 10 mins, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	C) Being addicted to media and smart phone kills your concentration. Realistically you need to disconnect a lot. You're not gonna hit access concentration while binging on YT videos and dicking around on Facebook.
</p>

<p>
	It's a silly challenge because you are being asked to provide material proof for immaterial phenomena to the satisfaction of people locked in a hardcore materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The issue isn't the proof, but changing what you consider to be proof. Criteria for proof are always paradigm-dependent.
</p>

<p>
	The paradigm is the problem, not the proof.
</p>

<p>
	You want proof of paranormal? Eat 30 grams of dried mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Just be careful what you wish for. You might get it

<p>
	As this post demonstrates, this muscle testing seems way too flaky and subjective to serve as a reliable measure of truth.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest dangers with it is, once you accept it, you're all-in, and it can really distort your entire worldview because you take the numbers seriously and think you can know everything this way.
</p>

<p>
	I thought a lot about adopting it, but ultimately decided that it is too epistemicly risky. It is more powerful to admit that you don't know than pulling numbers out of your ass and convincing yourself that you know something you don't.

</p>

<p>
	Stop being stubborn and go actually learn what inner and outer means.
</p>

<p>
	Your definitions are really squirrely.

Trust me on this. You have not studied this issue deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	It seems you are conflating "inner" with monkey mind. That is not what inner means. Body sensation and Vipassana and focusing on the breath is all inner. Inner is anything inside the body, outer is anything outside the skin of the body.
</p>

<p>
	But even that point aside, it is totally possible to meditate on one's inner thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	The key factor is not inner vs outer, it is consciousness! Wherever you bring consciousness there will be consciousness, even in the monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, mindfully observing one's thoughts is super useful.
</p>

<p>
	Study some of Shinzen Young's work if you wish to understand this properly and you don't believe me.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There are entire spiritual paths devoted to focusing on the inner, like Goenka style Vipassana retreats, parts of Shinzen Young's mindfulness system, and various kinds of yoga.
</p>

<p>
	The issue is not inner vs outer. The issue is how much consciousness are you applying to whatever you're observing.
</p>

<p>
	Focusing on the breath (an "inner" phenomena), for example, is one of the most common and effective meditation methods.
</p>

<p>
	So don't fearmonger about inner practices.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't like inner, if you don't find it suitable for you, then that's your preference. Don't universalize it to everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	And to those reading this who might now be scared of doing Vipassana or meditation -- just remember that the things described in this thread are very rare. This is not a reason to avoid serious spiritual practice. Nor is this a condemnation of Vipassana.
</p>

<p>
	You just have to know where to turn to if complications arise.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever you're dealing large numbers of people -- tens of thousands -- rare complications will always arise. Even routine surgery and medications have like 1:100 or 1:1000 serious complications.

	Since internal vs external is just a concept, it does not really matter. You can eat a hotdog from either end. Up to you.

<title>Depression after taking psychedelics?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Psychedelics are clinically proven treatments for depression.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to understand about depression is that it is self-created. You can get depressed about anything if you put your mind to it. It's all about how you're interpreting reality.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics tend to deconstruct reality. This can make you depressed if you are attached to various fantasies, illusions, and neurotic ways of living.
</p>

<p>
	Your prioritzation of work performance over truth and fulfillment is problematic. That's the wrong approach to life. And psychedelics will rudely awaken you to this point. Which might make you feel depressed if you have built an entire lifestyle and identity around it.
</p>

<p>
	Remeber, sometimes to grow you must pass through a dip. Growth is rarely always up, up, up.
</p>

This is standard practice in Zen. And I almost always do it eyes open. And it's worked for me. My first mystical experience was eyes open inquiry. Grounding your awareness in external perceptions is a great way to turn off the monkey mind. It does not have to be distraction at all.
</p>

<p>
	Really, it makes no difference. You can do it either way. It's a matter of personal preference.
</p>

<p>
	Eyes closed does increase sleepiness though, especially if you are already tired.
</p>

<p>
	For me eyes closed only works if I'm super-alert and not sleepy at all.

<p>
	Not a true psychedelic, but people often like to think of it as one and tell themselves they're using it as one.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to distinguish between recreational and non-recreational uses of substances.
</p>

<p>
	I do not encourage recreation usage. These substances are to be used for metaphysical investigation. Which means you trip hard and deep, rarely. As opposed to mild pleasure highs every other day.
</p>

<p>
	Pot also affects people differently. Some people report more psychedelic effects.

What you're describing is definitely highly unusual. Although not unprecedented.
</p>

<p>
	The human mind is a very complex thing. Not all human minds are alike. Some people are much more spiritually attuned and have access to psychic and paranormal realms that very few other people can access. Of course some people are also mentally unstable. Something like what you're describing is pretty rare. You could be legit mentally unstable. Or, you could just be very paranormally attuned and you're discovering this realm for the first time in your life and it comes as a shock and your rational mind does not yet know how to navigate these realms. You could also be repressing some kind of deep past trauma like abuse, molestation, rape, death in the family, etc.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I'd read up a lot more on other people who've had similar experiences. Don't expect quality answers from most Western doctors / scientists. They will just think you're crazy. You need to research transpersonal psychology, psychic stuff, the work of Stan Grof, New Age books, etc. You will probably find some answers there.
</p>

<p>
	There are paranormally gifted people you could find who can help you understand what is going on with you. Try searching for some in your area through Yelp.com
</p>

<p>
	Don't be to quick to judge this experience a negative. It might turn out to be a blessing in disguise, a gateway to a whole new dimension of reality and the beginning of a powerful life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	Do a google search for "vipassana psychosis" and other similar phrases that might describe your experience. You also want to be very careful and precise in describing what happened to you so you and others don't jump to the wrong conclusions.
</p>

<p>
	For example, some of my deepest psychedelic trips on 5-MeO-DMT were so deep, with insights about the nature of reality so profound, that if I did not have a rock solid theoretical foundation, I could definitely see myself feeling like I went insane. If most ordinary people were exposed to such insights point-blank with no preparation they would start to lose their grip on reality in a negative, dysfunctional way.
</p>

<p>
	You could also read books on psychosis to see what that means and how it works. Make sure you read a diversity of books from different perspectives, not just the standard Western academic perspective.
</p>

<p>
	Your ultimate intention should be to figure out what happened to you and why.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Traditionally, many shamans in native tribal cultures develop their abilities after a traumatic psychotic break. So fear not. You are not alone.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Try to do it when you're sharpest during the day, not right before bed. Inquiry is really good after a short nap.
</p>

<p>
	Inquiry requires strong focus skills. You could try doing it using a journal to help keep yourself on track.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, eyes-open works best for me. Closed-eyes tends to put me too much in my head and fall asleep.
</p>

<p>
	When inquiring you want to be in a very wake, sharp, calm state of mind.

<p>
	Sounds like the opposite of good.
</p>

<p>
	Quit that shit, since you're not able to use it in moderation.
</p>

<p>
	This is not how psychedelics are to be used.

</p>

<p>
	All of that is basically nonsense. It does not give a proper account of ego or consciousness at all.
</p>

<p>
	You are accusing me of being biased when really it seems more like you see me that way because you have not yet seriously investigated your own biases.
</p>

<p>
	Scott is not to be taken seriously at all. He's trapped in a stage Orange paradigm. The fact that he is enamoured with Trump's persuasion ability shows you how weak and short-sighted Scott's value system is.
</p>

<p>
	Being enamoured with Trump's ability to persuade is like being enamoured with Hannibal Lecter's skill at eating people.
</p>

<p>
	Just because I don't take such nonsense seriously don't confuse that with closedmindness. You brought a knife to a gun fight here, son <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	When you become very conscious you will easily see through all of this kind of egoic pseudo-intellectualism.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people get the bright idea to try to school me when it would be much wiser to take a seat and listen very carefully to what is being said. Very advanced stuff is being said that very few human beings on Earth understand.

<title>The definite guide to non-duality, enlightenment, and the nature of reality</title>

</p>

<p>
	I don't see a proper explanation there of what the universe or reality is.
</p>

<p>
	There is no physical universe. That is just a concept. The universe did not originate from nothing, it is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	There is also no such thing as perception. There is also no such thing as consciousness inside a body.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is not dependent on reality. Reality and consciousness are identical.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like you may have realized no-self, but not the Absolute nature of reality.
</p>

<p>
	There are many depths of enlightenment and nonduality, so be careful.
</p>

<title>Godel’s Incompletness: Am I pointing at myself?</title>

</p>

<p>
	In the ultimate sense, there is only one substance, one thing in existence, so it is incapable of pointing at itself because it is itself!
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately there is only Being. All symbols collapse into Being.
</p>

<p>
	A snake eating its tail ultimately just turns into a dimensionless dot.
</p>

<p>
	You are the universe trying to point at itself without realizing that pointing is impossible because when you are the whole universe anything you point to is you and anything you point with is also you!
</p>

<p>
	What you are overlooking is Being! Direct Being!
</p>

<p>
	Being cannot be known symbolically. You must BE it.
</p>

<p>
	You must realize that all knowledge and thought is a 2nd order phenomenon, the foundation of which is Being. A 2nd order phenomenon cannot grasp 1st order phenomenon. Just like an image on an LCD screen cannot grasp a pixel because it is made out pixels! An image cannot know pixels because it IS pixels!

</p>

<p>
	In other words, a dead man can't die and has nothing to lose or fear.

</p>

<p>
	You are God after all.
</p>

<p>
	Making shit happen is part of the movie! If the hero in the movie just sits around patiently waiting, nothing will happen. See? It will then just be a boring movie of a dude sitting around waiting.
</p>

<p>
	This paradox arises because you are both the watcher of the movie and the actor in the movie. You must learn to act, but in a detached way. Which is tricky and takes some practice.
</p>

<p>
	It's a newbie mistake to interpret no-free-will as an excuse for inaction and laziness. What no-free-will really means is that hard work happens without free will. It does NOT mean: don't do hard work or don't put in any effort. Effort is very necessary. Just realize, that effort is not really coming from the ego but from God/Spirit/Infinite Intelligence working through you. Become a channel for Infinite Intelligence and it will make you work hard to do its bidding. But it will be an enjoyable, free-flowing kind of work.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality means that all distinctions are arbitrary, including the distinction between life and death, reality and fantasy.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, of course!
</p>

<p>
	What you're missing is the distinction between thinking vs being.
</p>

<p>
	Thought != Being
</p>

<p>
	Thought of being != Being
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of neti neti is to stop all thought. Once all thoughts die down, whatever is left, is pure being.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever your true nature is, you are it prior to thought.
</p>

<p>
	The actuality of what you are is a constant. But holding that as a thought is not it.
</p>

<p>
	What are you when you are not thinking about yourself?
</p>

<p>
	Don't think the answer!!!
</p>

<p>
	BE it!
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Yes, you can be conscious of Infinity in your sleep. Happens to me occasionally. It's really cool. You exist as an infinite singularity.
</p>

<title>How to distinguish between ego trick / genuine insight?</title>

<p>
	You can't. Therein lies the whole puzzle of life.
</p>

<p>
	You don't know what you don't know.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why it's so important to stay openminded and humble. And to seek out alternative perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	You could always be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Yesterday's insight is tomorrow's delusion.
</p>

<p>
	A genuine commitment to truth at all costs is also very important. Just through radical self-honesty you can cut through 99% of fantasies and illusions. Most people do not set the intention to be self-honest.

If you're between 14 to 22, you're still basically a teenager and will require more sleep than an adult in their 30s or 40s.
</p>

<p>
	It also very much depends on how you use your mind and body, how much you work, how much you study, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's also a good ideas to optimize your sleep environment by lightproofing your whole bedroom, getting a good mattress, and eliminating noise.
</p>

<p>
	Diet also affects your sleep a lot. Cut back on carbs, wheat, and junk food.
</p>

<p>
	You might also want to get your thyroid hormone levels checked. Underactive thyroid is very common these days, causing fatigue and sleepiness.

<p>

	I've questioned him extensively about it and to me it seems that YES he is.

<p>
	He has abiding nondual awareness and loss of distinction between self/other.

It's not a matter of gathering more data, it's a matter of PR and changing cultural norms.
</p>

<p>
	The materialist, rationalist paradigm is the chief obstacle. It must be undermined in the same way Copernicus and Galileo undermined the stationary Earth paradigm. This takes deacades and centuries because the status quo always clings. That's just what collective egos do.
</p>

<p>
	The book I'm working on and the videos I'll be releasing are designed to deconstruct materialism and rationalism. That is my long term project.

<p>
	You might also want to take a stab at self-inquiry. It has a very different feel than meditation. Meditation without serious self-inquiry tends to not produce enlightenment. It is important that you start to deconstruct the self and reality. The upside of this is that it has positive effects long before enlightenment happens. You can get a lot of value from just deconstructing everything you know. Pick a thing and deconstruct it. Deconstruction dovetails very nicely with psychedelics too.
</p>

<p>
	If you are really serious about spiritual growth, you can get a ton of it very quickly by combining contemplation, deconstruction, and a psychedelic trip once very two weeks for 1 year. With this formula you will grow more in 1 year than you have in the last 10 years combined.
</p>

<p>
	My deepest and fastest growth has come from this approach. In fact, it's too effective. I've had to back off on it because the mind can only integrate so much so fast.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation requires hardcore practice to get serious results. Most people who meditate will never get nondual states because that usually requires industrial-grade levels of meditation. It's very easy to waste years meditating ineffectively, doing weak versions of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Also, not all people have the same level of spiritual atunement. For some people meditation is easy and they don't need a lot of it to get big results. But this is not most people.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are far more effective for nondual insights and states. So yeah, doing some higher dose trips will definitely get you a taste of what you're after.
</p>

<p>
	But as far as your daily practice I'd say, either upgrade your technique to something more stringent, or switch to Kriya Yoga. I find Kriya far more effective than meditation.
</p>

<p>
	To get serious results from meditation usually requires doing hardcore week-long retreats and 1000s of hours of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	I'm one of those people for whom meditation is not that effective. For meditation to be effective you must develop laser-focused one-pointed concentration. Watch my video: Meditation vs Concentration.
</p>

<p>
	I've met people who have done 20 years of Vipasanna but still don't know what enlightenment is. This is actually the norm.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is a very radical state of consciousness. Very few human beings are capable of it without serious practice or outside means like psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to experience the highest levels of human consciousness, schedule a 5-MeO retreat. It will be worth the hassle and it will motivate you to meditate more.
</p>

<p>
	Forum comments are my version of Lays potatoes chips. Can't take this shit too seriously or you'll go insane trying to out-logic all the nonsense that exists on the internet.
</p>

<p>
	Many things don't even rise to the level of warranting a serious reply, in which case ridicule and snark becomes an effective tool. It's the equivalent of a Zen slap across the face.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like Trump has not earned enough respect to be reasoned with. Sometimes you gotta call devils for devils when you see them. Pretending that a devil is not a devil just to sound "fair" is actually untruthful. And that's exactly what a devil like Trump will try to exploit to his advantage.
</p>

<p>
	The middle ground between truth and falsehood is falsehood.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that most nondual teachers are preaching to the choir. They only teach that tiny percentage of the population which is already primed and ripe for the teaching. They make no effort to prime the rest of the population. You either come begging the Zen master for a teaching, or you have no chance to even enter the Zendo.
</p>

<p>
	It's one game to teach primed people nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	It's another game entirely to prime the vulgar masses to be receptive to nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to make your life easy as a teacher, you only teach students who are Spiral stages Green and above. The really hard work is teaching Orange and below, who are dense, arrogant, and numerous as fuck.

<p>
	That is where you are wrong.
</p>

<p>
	The confirmation bias in this case is on behalf of the materialist scientists who reject the statistical and anecdotal data.
</p>

<p>
	The data is all there. People just suck at handling the radical truth.
</p>

<p>
	The mind naturally denies whatever does not fit its survival agenda. That's all it is.
</p>

<p>
	Bigoted minds deny cutting-edge truths all the time. This has been happening in every domains of life for over 5000 years of human history. And you can bet it happens today.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you're trying to capture subtle phenomena using gross means, like trying to capture a delicate butterfly using a bulldozer. And then you complain that butterflies don't exist. Yeah, because you kill them with your fucking bulldozer.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is: leave your bulldozer at home.

<p>
	That is my natural inclination, but one of the problems with teaching self-actualization and nonduality is that people get so sucked into all sorts of twisted ideologies -- like that of JP, Sam Harris, Stefan Molyneux, SJW, capitalism, post-modernism, anti-post-modernism, etc.  -- that it becomes impossible to teach them without some amount of deconstruction work.
</p>

<p>
	That is in fact the unconscious goal of people like JP, Sam Harris, Stefan Molyneux, etc. -- their job is to make the intellectual marketplace so muddied, confused, and polarized that it becomes impossible for people to find serious spiritual teachings. This is no accident. This is how the devil works: through muddying the water. The devil knows he can never win on merit because his position if fundamentally false, so all he can do is confuse people and stall out the clock.
</p>

<p>
	This is a classic tactic use by global warming deniers, for example. They just need to muddy the waters and sow enough doubt to stall out the clock to get their paycheck.
</p>

<p>
	So some of these devils need to be called out on their BS sometimes, to put them in their place. Otherwise the unwitting masses start to take them too seriously. An intelligent devil like JP or Sam Harris is a dangerous thing. It is not obvious how he is wrong and how best to rebut him. To a casual observer a lot of the things he says ring true and reasonable. Of course that's precisely how the devil works. He sprinkles nuggets of truth into his bullshit lasagna.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of all ideologies is to distract from truth-seeking. Which is why ideologies have been so widespread throughout all of human history up to and including today. The devil's strategy is: flood the marketplace with so much bullshit that people cannot even tell that actual Truth is possible. If you want to safeguard a precious diamond, throw it into an ocean of liquid shit full of fake diamonds. Then no one will ever find it.

Nietzche just misunderstood spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	What he blasts as "slave morality" is just surrender, humility, love, peace, and enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	 Nietzche's entire understanding of the origins of religion are wrong. Humility was not forced on anyone. Humility is the end result of ego loss.
</p>

<p>
	Nietzche's ego demonized it.
</p>

<p>
	I would put him at Orange. He hated Blue. A classic Orange atheist nihilist knee-jerk reaction to Blue.

<title>Evidence for psychic phenomena?</title>

<p>
	Many statistical studies have been done on ESP. They all come out positive in meta-analysis.
</p>

<p>
	The chances of ESP not being true are like one in a billion according to the statistical analysis. The problem is that no serious scientist wants to accept it because it would ruin his career.
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention that you can teach yourself to do it.
</p>

<p>
	Check out Dean Radin's research.

</p>

<p>
	If only it were as easy as to just sit down and make a game.
</p>

<p>
	You must be extremely prudent and strategic about testing niches and taking risks in business.
</p>

<p>
	Starting a successful biz usually requires many years of experience within a certain field. You must know many of the traps of your field.
</p>

<p>
	The advice is, find your life purpose and master a specific narrow field.
</p>

Read 10 diverse books on nonduality and that will clear a lot of stuff up for you. You don't have to reinvent the wheel here. Mankind has understood nonduality for 5000 years at least. It's all been written down for those who care to read.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like you're struggling your way through mathematics when all you gotta do is pick up a math textbook.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is actually older and more solid than mathematics. They just don't teach it in school because it destroys all reality and society.

<p>
	"Woo-woo" is just the excuse of a bigoted mind to justify its bigotry as science.
</p>

<p>
	Every cutting-edge scientific discovery feels "woo-woo". Until the mind gets used to it, then it becomes "established science" which could not have been otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind always plays this game of moving the goalposts and denying its own bigotry.
</p>

<p>
	Reality distortion 101

<p>
	Pure self is  __________ .
</p>

<p>
	All the coma did was disable the mechanism which constructed the false self. Like turning off a movie projector. No actors are killed because they were not real to begin with, just some moving light.
</p>

<p>
	Turning off the projector does not making the on-screen actor suddenly experience "the real world". There is no real world outside the movie world.

<p>
	Love is a facet of the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	This makes no sense from the materialist paradigm. You have to stop thinking of reality as a dumb physical mechanical object. Instead, think of reality as a Giant Mind, and minds can love.
</p>

<p>
	I'll make a video about it in the future.

	It's a model, you know... like the 10 ox herding pictures.
</p>

<p>
	See its utility but don't get hung up on it.
</p>

<p>
	You guys are still not being mentally flexible enough in your study of all this information. You're getting hung up on models and judging them because you take them as all or nothing, true or false, good or bad, right or wrong. This is an overly literalist approach which you should strive to outgrow.
</p>

<p>
	To quantify enlightenment does not have to mean that enlightenment is quantifiable. The taste of a chili pepper is not quantifiable, yet that does not stop scientists from quantifying the hotness level of chili peppers. And it is useful to know that a habenaro is a lot hotter than a jalepeno.

<p>
	Right. So the thing for you to realize about that is: that's a fear-based concern. Fear is an emotion which distorts an objective unbiased inquiry into truth.
</p>

<p>
	Can you see that? You are afraid of seeking the truth because you're afraid you might fall into delusion.
</p>

<p>
	But, eventually you will realize that itself is a delusion! Because all fear is a delusion of the ego-mind. Why? Because you are afraid of death? But death itself the Truth! So all fear is the avoidance of Truth.

<p>
	There is no how. Absolute Truth is DIRECT!
</p>

<p>
	This does not make sense to you because you believe you are a human being having perceptions of a physical external reality. This turns out to be a false belief. The Absolute Truth is accessible to you at every second of your life. In fact, there is nothing but Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Can you see how your belief that "the truth cannot be accessed directly" is just an unfounded unscientific belief? You in fact have no proof that truth cannot be accessed directly because one cannot prove a negative. And if you're honest you'll admit that you've never even tried.

<p>
	Of course he's correct. No maybes about it.
</p>

<p>
	This is only shocking news to dogmatic materialists.
</p>

<p>
	Mankind has known about all this for over 5000 years, since the ancient Egyptians at least.
</p>

<p>
	Dean Radin is an example of how a true scientist must think: radically openminded and unbiased. You follow experiment wherever it leads, and if happens to lead to magic, then magic it is.

I mean, you’ve been meditating and self-inquiring for close to five years. If you haven’t reached 600s yet, then what does that say about those techniques?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I dunno, hard to say. Ramaji rated my LOC level somewhere in the no-self zone (600-700), but I disagreed with his assessment. I thought it was too high. Once he learned I use psychedelics he sort of said his LOC rating might not be accurate for me.
</p>

<p>
	Because I have a very creative mind, I am not that good at meditation. Other people find mediation much easier. I've had to go through a lot of techniques to finally settle on Kriya yoga. In a sense, I've wasted a lot those 5 years doing poor meditation. I wish I'd known about Kriya 5 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	But also, I've become conscious of LOC 1000 and beyond. I'm just not stabilized in it yet.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to understand is that 5-MeO does not fit anyone's models or LOCs. 5-MeO can get you beyond LOC 1000 in 15 minutes. Virtually no spiritual master or teacher understands or accounts for 5-MeO in their models. In a sense, I found a way to hack the entire spiritual path. But few people believe me. They think I'm nuts. But that's just because they haven't tried a big strong dose of 5-MeO.

</p>

<p>
	Mahamudra is considered an important core technique.
</p>

<p>
	But you don't have to add it in right off the bat. You can master the other techniques and add in Mahamudra in a few months.
</p>

<p>
	Pranayama is the most important technique.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let perfectionism stop you from mastering yoga. Do whatever is necessary to circumnavigate excuses and obstacles.

</p>

<p>
	In this work, it's good to have your illusions dispelled quickly, otherwise the ego chases rainbows and butterflies into fantasy land.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you got this response is because your post is titled and takes the attitude of "Convince me of the truth". Which is not at all the right attitude for seeking truth. Asking to be convinced of the truth is one of the most disrespectful things you can ask of a truth-realized person. It would be like telling a math teacher: "Convince me that 1 + 1 = 2. How do I know you're not tricking me?"
</p>

<p>
	The answer to your question is simply this: You don't know what is true. You don't know who to trust. You don't know what to do. That is a good place to be. You have to get used to not knowing things in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Only after you realize that anything or anyone could be tricking you, you start to investigate truth seriously for yourself without believing anyone.
</p>

<p>
	Have you seen my Practical Guide to Enlightenment?
</p>

<p>
	This is the process by which you discover the truth without having to trust anyone or anything:
</p>
<iframe data-embedcontent="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/7360-leos-practical-guide-to-enlightenment/?do=embed"></iframe>

<p>
	Do not even trust me.
</p>

<p>
	Do the inquiry and see what it yields.

<p>
	Existence is not demonstrable to anyone.

<p>
	Neither is identity, rationality, or science. All of these are dependent on subjective experience.

</p>

<p>
	You must do work to discover what is true.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot sit back on your ass and expect truth to be delivered to you by someone. That is not how truth works.
</p>

<p>
	If you really cared about truth, you would be willing to invest 20 years searching for it. That's roughly the kind of dedication this work requires. Dabblers will not cut it.
</p>

<p>
	And there is no guarantee you will ever find it, or that it's even possible for a human to find. That's your predicament from your POV.
</p>

<p>
	From my POV, I've found the Absolute Truth and I understand why existence exists. It's a pretty cool thing. Whether you trust me or not is irrelevant. Trusting me will not help you one bit.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't know what to do, you're stuck in the Matrix. No one can free you but you. If you do not desire to be free, then stay a slave. The point of your life is to awaken, but you are free to piss your life away and stay a slave. Up to you.

<title>Truth vs. Ego</title>

<p>
	It's very simple. How do you know science and rationality are the best way to understand reality? To make such a claim is already to be deeply unscientific and irrational because for you to know that science explains all of reality you would have to run a scientific test on this claim. And the only way to run that test is to spend a billion years investigating every corner of the universe until you finally demonstrate that every phenomena possible within reality can be understood by science. It is by no means a given that this test will come out true. In fact, it's much more likely that you will discover tons of phenomena which cannot be understood by existing scientific method at all. You would be a naive fool to assume that science and rationality can grasp every facet of reality. This is a highly unscientific position.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know science and rationality are not hallucinations?
</p>

<p>
	How do you know science and rationality can be trusted?
</p>

<p>
	How do you know science and rationality cover all possible phenomena?
</p>

<p>
	How do you know science and rationality are not tools of the ego-mind?
</p>

<p>
	How can you trust rationality when rationality has been used by people to delude themselves for thousands of years?
</p>

<p>
	How can you trust science when the history of science is filled with intelligent scientists making all sorts of absurd errors in understanding reality, only to have those errors exposed hundreds of years later, after they are dead?
</p>

<p>
	Who says reality is scientific and rational? Why should it be?
</p>

<p>
	What if science and rationality are just subjective, human-centric modes of perceiving reality?
</p>

<p>
	Notice, a person inside a Matrix can do science and rationality for 50 years and still have no idea he is inside a Matrix because science and rationality are illusions within the realm of the Matrix and cannot go outside it.

<p>
	You don't know anything. The problem is that you are assuming you know a lot of stuff that you do not actually know.
</p>

<p>
	All that enlightenment is, is total skepticism about EVERYTHING. You become so skeptical that you stop believing you exist.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is what remains after all your beliefs have been questioned to death, especially your beliefs about physical reality and your personal story of being a human being who was born on this planet called Earth. This is a story you invented.
</p>

<p>
	Don't believe me. Just question yourself to death.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental problem here is that you believe an objective physical reality exists. This turns out to be false. All that exists are your projections and beliefs about it. Question your beliefs and physical reality will disappear as though it never existed.
</p>

<p>
	You are inside of a hallucination. I am not kidding. WAKE UP!!! WAKE UP!!! WAKE UP!!!

<p>
	Science and rationality are hallucinations so you cannot rely on them to escape the Matrix.

<p>
	No, the problem is that you already think you know how reality is.
</p>

<p>
	You do not know if truth is knowable or not. Which means, it could be knowable. But you are assuming it can't. Which is a groundless and unscientific assumption.

</p>

<p>
	You have not seriously asked any deep questions about existence. You have not even bothered to question science and rationality, nor your own being.
</p>

<p>
	Your own mind has you thoroughly deceived. You do not yet even have an inkling how self-deceived you are.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Nothing is real. That is enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	You are confusing enlightenment for some kind of positive belief system. It is the polar opposite of that. Enlightenment is nothing. With enlightenment, all knowledge of reality is erased. It's like wiping a hard drive and not writing anything back on it. You are left totally blank. This blank is so blank that not only is your mind wiped out, all of physical reality is wiped out. Everything that exists ceases to exist. Nothing remains at all! No body, no brain, no Earth, no universe, no science, no rationality. Just pure blank. At this point you are physically dead. Nothing remains of you. And that is the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	You do not really want enlightenment. It is the last in the world your mind wants. You'd have to be suicidal to want it.
</p>

<p>
	People just do not appreciate how radical enlightenment is. You think I'm exaggerating. But I'm not.

<p>
	Freelance gigs are probably the simplest way to start. Although the market is flooded and pay usually isn't that good unless you've got some really good technical skills to offer.
</p>

<p>
	You can learn web programming pretty quickly and offer your services on freelancing websites like Upwork.com or Guru.com
</p>

<p>
	The better your skills and portfolio of work, the more money you'll make.

<p>
	It sounds like good plan if you are passionate about being an entrepreneur. Not everyone is cut out for that though. You have to be really self-driven.
