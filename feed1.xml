	African tribes give Iboga to teens. That's some hardcore drug. If a teen can handle Iboga he can handle anything.
</p>

<p>
	Of course some of them probably die.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual growth is not for the cowardly. That said, don't be foolish about it either. I don't recommend psychedelics unless you have a mature mind.
</p>

<p>
	What matters is not your physical age but the maturity of your mind.

<title>Leo's Greatest Insight - Authenticity</title>

<p>
	The paradox is that caring about other people can also become an obstacle. Women especially can develop an ego out of playing a "selfless" helper role.
</p>

<p>
	So you gotta strike a delicate balance.
</p>

<p>
	This whole process is a delicate balancing act. Too much to any one side results in pathology and getting stuck.

<p>
	Seems very likely.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it should be possible to take two brains/minds and merge them into one superbrain/supermind, resulting is some freaky stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a species in which every member's nervous system is interconnected with each other into a literal hive mind. That should produce some interesting new emergent stuff that cannot even be imagined.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute itself will never change. But the extent to which it understands itself, the extent to which is sees the interconnectedness of all form, should vary dramatically.
</p>

<p>
	The formless does not get more complex, but the form does. And since form and formless are one, to be totally omniscient will require a full integration of all form across all time. Which no human being can do no matter how enlightened they get.
</p>

<p>
	To put it another way, you do not fully understand what God is until you have experienced and integrated all form.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox of awakening is that it is Absolute, but it is not total. There are infinite degrees of totality because form extends forever. So you can keep realizing more and more of yourself forever without end. And that's exactly what evolution is doing.
</p>

<p>
	You are being far too flippant and one-dimensional. What you're exhibiting here is an absolutist pathology of awakening. A form of Zen devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Life is multiple-dimensional, infinite, and complex. There's way more to this work than you hold.
</p>

<p>
	What is silly is that you think you've reached some kind of end.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing is never done. Life is reinventing itself all the time, without end. Join the party.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, and this is a complex and multi-dimensional thing. There is a LOT of subtle self-obsessed crap even after your first awakening.
</p>

<p>
	But also, realization is not just about becoming aware that you are nothing. It's also becoming aware that you are everything, and then realizing how God works through everything. So there are a lot of gems to be mined here.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org is a full-spectrum teaching. We are not merely interested in realizing nothingness here. We are interested in all dimensions of life and how they intersect with that Nothingness. That Nothingness turns out to be identical to every domain of life.
</p>

<p>
	How do you structure your life and society as a whole to align with your realization of Nothingness? How do you help elevate and awaken the whole world in an effective and non-pathological manner? These are the types of issues we're interested in here. We are interested in understanding what everything is and how everything interconnects. Which is a much broader scope than most spiritual teachings.
</p>

<p>
	I have taken a break from yoga and even meditation lately.
</p>

<p>
	My spirituality is becoming more organic and natural to the point where I am surrendering my rigid practices.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that the ultimate goal is for your entire life to become one seamless act of meditation, creativity, and love. You become God-like.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I still have a lot of work left. This is just a phase I'm going through, trying new stuff to see what works best.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, my mind is gradually becoming more and more quiet, making it easier to be in a semi-meditative state all the time, or at least especially when sitting down.

			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's true, we love shortcuts. Then again, not all shortcuts are automatically bad. The whole point of human society is to invent technological shortcuts for stuff that used to be impossible or really difficult. A car is a shortcut for walking to work. A farm is a shortcut for hunting migratory packs of animals. etc.
</p>

<p>
	Is it sustainable? I don't know. The research is still pending. What were are doing here with Actualized.org is on the cutting edge of human knowledge and technology. There is both risk and reward for being on the cutting edge. The discoveries we make, our children will take for granted as obvious. But right now it is not obvious.
</p>

<p>
	I would not recommend taking modafinil every day for months on end. Use it occasionally and stop if you feel like it's becoming a crutch. I don't use it much. Sometimes I just forget to take it for weeks at a time. I can function without it. But sometimes its a nice boost to my creative or meditative work.
</p>

<p>
	As of this writing I have not taken modafinil for over a month. Simply forgot it even existed. So to me it has no addictive quality at all. If I felt it had an addictive quality, I could probably not take it at all and I definitely would not recommend it publicly. My standard for recommending stuff publicly is that it must be non-addictive. For example, I do not recommend ketamine because it has some addictive qualities.
</p>

<p>
	I think modafinil can be very helpful to people who are new to this work. After years of meditation and so forth, you will probably outgrow it. Some people really struggle with ADHD, for example, and it's not just in their head. ADHD can cripple one's ability to self-actualize, which is a great shame. So it's nice if we have some tools for helping people to combat that.
</p>

<p>
	I don't think they change brain type.
</p>

<p>
	I think they can change how the brain is wired, which is very significant. Not sure about brain chemistry since there's no way I can measure that.
</p>

<p>
	Subjectively it feels like the last 13 5-MeO trips have significantly changed how my brain works in a permanent way. It's subtle, but also significant. I am not the same person I was a few months ago. But also, I'm not totally different either. It seems pretty clear to me that if I do another 50 trips, I will be permanently changed after that. My consciousness will be much more expanded at the very least. Perhaps even a more radical change could result. I suspect that at some point the brain/mind will totally collapse and reconfigure itself to function at a much higher level. Permanent superhuman levels seem within reach but I have not verified it yet. It's going to take a lot of tripping and serious integration work. And won't be easy.

</p>

<p>
	You can think of it as "lack of resistance" but that's just one facet of it, and it's still a concept you're holding.
</p>

<p>
	ACTUAL Love is something you must become conscious of. There is no way around that. It's like the color red. You cannot reduce it to anything else. You must actually look at red to know what it is.
</p>

<p>
	The reason my descriptions are not landing with you, or don't seem useful to you, is because you are not in the right state of consciousness. It's like I'm describing an orgasm to someone who's never had one. So it falls on deaf ears.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe try some mushrooms, LSD, or MDMA.
</p>

<p>
	Realizing Absolute Love is an epic, life-transforming experience. It's about as radical as getting abducted by an alien. You can't really believe it until it's happening to you, and then it's so real it cannot be denied or doubted.
</p>

<p>
	When you change your DNA into that of a chimp, post us a selfie, and we will admit we were wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Epigenetics is real and valid. But it does not mean you can change it without limits. The limits are very tight, as they must be, to ensure you don't kill yourself.

<p>
	This topic goes way beyond realization.
</p>

<p>
	And what I'm saying is that there is no such thing as one "realization". That's an abstraction. In fact, each realization is unique, with a unique depth, breadth, level of embodiment, and corresponding state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And none of this contradicts Oneness or the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that realization does not happen in isolation. It is always intermixed with mind and brain. With one's state of development, with one's body, with one's energetic system, etc. The realization is happening through a unique human body and mind. So no two realizations are identical even though the Absolute is one.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is always the case, but one's awareness and understanding of the Absolute varies a great deal. Case in point, a mule does not understand the Absolute even though the Absolute is there in the mule. A mule is not aware of God, even though it is God.
</p>

<p>
	We are not saying that a human cannot change or grow in certain ways. But there are hard limits on what you can change. And it's also a question of how much work is involved in changing. Maybe you could change yourself, but it will take a lot of work, whereas some people are already born that way.

<p>
	You cannot teach a mule arithmetic no matter how hard you try.
</p>

<p>
	To deny this leads to gross errors, unworkable solutions, frustration, and even evil.
</p>

<p>
	Acknowledging the uniqueness and individuality of each human is very important to build a well-functioning society. You cannot treat everyone as an abstraction. Some people have very different needs.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Why People Seem Crazy
</p>

<p>
	It's one of my most important videos if you want to understand humanity.

</p>

<p>
	If physiology was irrelevant, then there would be no difference between humans and chimpanzees. Our DNA is 99% the same, yet that 1% difference makes a HUGE difference in capabilities. These differences are not just between species, they are within each species as well. That's how evolution works. There is diversity. There is no such thing as "a human" or "a chimpanzee". Each one is unique. With unique strengths and weaknesses.
</p>

<p>
	It could not be otherwise.

<p>
	It is not victim mindset to say that a gorilla has more strength than a human. A gorilla could rip the arms out of man's sockets and a rattlesnake can see in infrared whereas you cannot. A woman can give birth, a man cannot.
</p>

<p>
	This is just acknowledging that an organism's capabilities are related to its physiology and genetics. It's a very obvious fact which many tend to overlook because they love the idea that all people are equal. Well, all people may deserve equal civil rights, but they are not equal in capability. Not even close. Some people cannot add two numbers together. Some people cannot read a book. Some people cannot see the color red. Some people cannot walk. Some people are covered in hair from head to toe. Some people hallucinate flying monkeys. Some people are psychopaths. Some people are witches. Some people have telepathic abilities. Some people have an amazing sense of smell, like a dog. Some people have perfect pitch. Some people have super-human visualization abilities, like Nikola Tesla.

			What I hear this guy describing in this interview is kinda what I hear from you with all your awakenings with 5-MeO but he’s having this just naturally. He’s describing literally <i><u>thousands</u></i> of deeper and deeper states of consciousness without any sort of external leverage like a guru, teacher, or psychedelic.

<p>
	Yup, this certainly happens.
</p>

<p>
	People generally do not appreciate how much difference there can be between brains. Some brains are able to access spiritual dimensions 1000x more efficiently than others.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that evolution naturally selects for human brains to favor survival and fitting into society rather than witchcraft. As we know, tens of thousands of witches and mystics (the most spiritually gifted humans) were demonized and executed. Witches are demonized in basically all cultures around the world.

			These cases like Sadhguru, Ramana Maharshi, even Ralston who describes his staggering amount of work (the talent aka inherent capacity still has to be there in order to be actualized)... I personally have a hard time finding relating to these people because it’s like relating to a human fantasy in most cases. It’s like being a good runner but comparing yourself to the world record holder in the marathon. I thinks it’s tricky because these people don’t seem extrodinary so it seems like “well yeah I should be able to do this then.” These people are not your average no-self level enlightened people.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Absolutely! Do not even try to compare yourself to the likes of Sadhguru, Ramana, or Ralston. That is a recipe for depression. That would be like comparing your lifting ability to a forklift.
</p>

<p>
	It is imperative that you walk your own unique spiritual path, not some guru's path. Your path must match your strengths and capacities.

<p>
	Yes, appreciate freakish levels of excellence and consciousness in the same way you might appreciate freakish levels of musical skill or artistic skill. Don't expect everyone to be a Mozart, a Picasso, an Einstein, or a Da Vinci. These were gifted, genius people. They did not achieve it merely through hard work, although they did often work hard.
</p>

<p>
	At the same time, don't make victim-like excuses for why you cannot awaken. Don't think like this, "Oh well, I'm not as gifted as Sadhguru so I will never awaken." No! You can still awaken. It will just take more work.
</p>

<p>
	This also explains why psychedelics play such an important role. They allow people to access states of consciousness which the best gurus access naturally and effortlessly. The psychedelic levels the playing field. It's like taking a pill that would match your chess-playing abilities to Gary Kasporov. Then you can experience what it's like to play chess at a world-class level. You get to see what the guru sees. This allows you to understand the guru much better because now there is a set of common reference experiences between you two. And of course this motivates you to do the work because you see the amazing potential of the work which you would otherwise never see.
</p>

	LSD can definitely produce ego-death. At 125ug I get it basically every time.
</p>

<p>
	Every substance I've tried has produced ego-death for me at some point.
</p>

<p>
	Of course your results may vary.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is definitely the best for it. It's like pure ego-death in powdered form.

<p>
	Absolutely. In fact, I'd bet that the majority of enlightened people got there mostly due to their giftedness. It's just SO much easier that way. It's like being naturally high on psychedelics all the time.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to how the best weightlifters will be naturally selected for high testosterone. Those with naturally low testosterone simply won't be able to compete against them.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why many of the best gurus make the path sound easier than it actually is. It was easy for them. Yet it will be virtually impossible for ordinary folk.
</p>

<p>
	This is the kind of stuff gurus rarely admit. Because you cannot know this stuff from sitting on a meditation cushion. To know this requires broad psychological research which most gurus dismiss because it is not 1st person experience.
</p>

<p>
	Different brains have very different capabilities. It's not merely a matter of degree, it's also a different in kind. Some brains can access states and phenomena which other brains just cannot.

	They do WAY more than increase brain plasticity. And they absolutely increase consciousness.

<p>
	This is not true, but at your level of consciousness and development it is true for you.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing about enlightenment work suggests you should not have relationships. If anything, your relationships will deepen. But at the same time you will not need them to be happy. So you'll get the best of both.
</p>

<p>
	What you're not realizing yet is that you ARE always alone, existentially speaking. Self/other is a conceptual distinction you are creating. All those "others" you think you're relating to are actually projections of your Self. No amount of relating will resolve your existential aloneness. That's something you must face head-on.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry, aloneness is not a problem. But if you feel like you need to connect with people, do so. What I'm talking about is more advanced than that. Many people here first just need to learn how to create relationships.
</p>

<p>
	As you become more conscious you should automatically lie less.
</p>

<p>
	Of course being more honest and authentic is a great spiritual practice.

<p>
	No, it would actually make you more meditative and focused. Modafinil quiets the mind, but simultaneously makes it hyper-creative. Thoughts slow down but become more powerful and intuitive. Similar to a mild psychedelic.

<p>
	They are not at odds with one another. Those "crazy" spiritual experiences facilitate the ego's dissolution.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, the ego's dissolution is not the only game in town.
</p>

<p>
	If you hold the "sober" state as more real than a "crazy" high state, that's an anchor point which needs deconstructing. The value of shifting states is that it helps to free oneself of states. But also keep in mind that whatever state you are in, that state is defining and limiting your understanding of reality. There are things you can understanding in a crazy high state which you cannot understand in a sober state. So to put a sober state as superior or more "natural" than a high state is incorrect. It's a bias. This is not to say one should get attached to high states either. The point is to be open to experiencing life from various kinds of states without demonizing them.
</p>

<p>
	People get trapped chasing states.
</p>

<p>
	But people also get trapped demonizing states and proclaiming that their state is the best and that other states are useless.

	For example, stage Green might love the idea of living in a Hippie commune. Stage Yellow will not care much for that because stage Yellow has transcended that and would rather be more independent. Of course this is a gross-generalization. Nothing strictly prevents a stage Yellow person from being part of a commune for a while.

			My main point is that if you take a child and show irrational beliefs into them and never teach them to think rationally, then it's maltreatment. Kind of like never telling a kid that Santa Claus really isn't real instead of letting them grow up without learning to be sceptical and question his environment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	If you were skeptical and questioned yourself, you'd realize that you yourself are an irrational belief which was indoctrinated from an early age, and that "problems" are also a belief, are not real, but a fiction constructed by your mind.
</p>

<p>
	So you are like that kid believing in Santa Claus (problems) and we are telling you to let it go. Be skeptical of problems and question whether they are real. Question your judgment of religion and reality.

<p>
	Can you see how your judgment destroys true exploration, open-mindedness, and spirituality?
</p>

<p>
	How can you be truly spiritual when you hate religion?
</p>

<p>
	True spirituality is acceptance and love of whatever is.
</p>

<p>
	By hating on religion you block yourself from being able to explore it openmindedly.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire problem with religion is grounded in ego. See? And the whole point of spirituality is to become conscious of how your ego distorts reality. But you're overlooking all that because of your hatred for religion.
</p>

<p>
	You are falling into the trap of the lesser Jihad. Just like how Islamic terrorists do. So you have more in common with Islamic terrorists than with the Buddha. To become a Buddha you must drop all judgment.

<p>
	You are the placing this expectation on science.
</p>

<p>
	You are also placing an expectation on models that they must be 100% accurate.
</p>

<p>
	The issue isn't whether science will express Absolute Truth. The issue is, how does Absolute Truth/Infinite Intelligence work through science to generate scientific discoveries and models. A model is not supposed to be 100% accurate. That's not the issue. The issue is, how come you can understand anything about nature at all? Even with only 50% accuracy. That is still an amazing feat. And it's deeply connected to Infinite Intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Science is, after all, an expression of Absolute Truth. Constructions of the human mind are still God's handy-work.
</p>

<p>
	How is it possible that science can produce a chemical which induces enlightenment? (And it can). What more could you want from science?

</p>

<p>
	Children are indoctrinated in every culture at stages Orange and Green too.
</p>

<p>
	The core issue here is that you resist loving child abuse. You hate child abuse. That's understandable, but it is a deluded and false position. Since child abuse is a part of reality, you are just denying what is true.
</p>

<p>
	All judgments of reality are delusion. No exceptions. Your job is to love reality without exceptions. Notice how this threatens your ego. You refuse to do it. Because you are a devil.

<title>Why do stage yellow people transcend love and relationships from stage green?</title>

			So what is the unhealthy part of green that yellow transcends? It seems to me that if you don’t want to have relationships out of love it’s like stage orange. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Green has several limiting features which are important to transcend:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Mob mentality
	</li>
	<li>
		Over-emphasis of connection, feelings, and relationship to the exclusion of facts, higher realities, and results
	</li>
	<li>
		New Agey, air-fairy thinking; overly upotian and naive rather than realistic, grounded, pragmatic.
	</li>
	<li>
		Green arrogance (thinking that Green is the most evolved stage)
	</li>
	<li>
		Excessive relativism, to the point of denying the importance of hierarchies and higher values
	</li>
	<li>
		A naive sort of love and sense of justice/fairness which doesn't fully appreciate the complexity of government, life, war, politics, relationships, business, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Demonization of stage Orange
	</li>
	<li>
		Lots of judgment still
	</li>
	<li>
		Under-appreciation of the dangers of stage Red
	</li>
	<li>
		Shallow, flaky forms of spirituality
	</li>
	<li>
		Lack of awareness of and appreciation of the necessity of the entire Spiral
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Stage Yellow people have MORE capacity for love, not less. Their love is more grounded and realistic than the overly-idealistic love of Green.

</p>

<p>
	Can you see how your hatred for religion is really just hatred of reality, and therefore hatred of yourself? Which is precisely what you don't like about religion. So you're hating on haters.
</p>

<p>
	Adding evil on top of evil does not create Good, it only compounds the evil.
</p>

<p>
	You have turned religion into your shadow.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to transcend this issue, apply love to religious people. Stop seeing them as separate from you. Stop judging them.
</p>

<p>
	It would be helpful if you studied religion more and developed a deep understanding of why religion exists.
</p>

<p>
	Let me reframe your question from a fundamentalist religious person's POV:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Christian: How long will it take until all Muslims are dead?
	</li>
	<li>
		Nazi Aryan: How long will it take until all Jew are dead?
	</li>
	<li>
		Muslim: How long will it take until all infidels are dead?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That is what you're doing.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than dreaming of destroying stuff, how about you learn to accept reality as it is?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The movement of your hand is not at all the same as understanding Einstein's General Relativity and being able to predict the existence of a black hole 100 years before it is photographed.
</p>

<p>
	You are underappreciating the degree of intelligence and understanding that goes into science. It is not so mechanical, and you cannot seperate it from truth in the way that you are trying to do.
</p>

<p>
	You are creating a duality between science and truth. There is a profound connection between metaphysics and epistemology.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is far more nuanced and profound, and no bit of forum explanation is going to do it justice.
</p>

<p>
	You take understanding for granted. Genuine understanding is possible. This is a very amazing thing!
</p>

<p>
	How is it that a dumb simplification can predict a black hole?
</p>

<p>
	All of this must be deeply contemplated, not replied to with dismissive answers.
</p>

<p>
	Without properly understanding this issue science and spirituality will not be integrated but fragmented from each other. In the future, mankind will integrate the two.

	There's a pretty massive difference between 10ug of LSD and 125ug of LSD.
</p>

<p>
	Or 0.5g of mushrooms and 4g of mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Or 15mg of 5-MeO and 30mg of 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	Doubling a psychedelic dose more than quadruples the effects.

He's interested in going as deep as possible and telling the truth like it is with no filter, weather people like it or not, similar to J. Krishnamurti. It's more so Spira, Tolle, Watts, Mooji, Sadhguru etc... that are to spread it wide as possible within peoples limited understanding, and thus heightening their level of awareness.

<p>
	I try to go wide and teach to ordinary people. I don't see myself as the deepest. I see myself as a bridge-builder, helping people to interconnect various parts of reality. At least that's my role for now. It might change in the future.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Sadhguru does not give a fuck about helping you understand how science and spirituality interconnect. I do.
</p>

<p>
	What is the connection between Western science & spirituality? << That's a really good question to contemplate.

			Okay, I see. But in instances where god is speaking words to/at someone, surely they would realise that it was themselves if the experience where true?

	</div>

<p>
	No, surely not. Duality is a tricky beast. In this case they are getting close to Truth but they still haven't realized that self/other is a duality which must collapse. Despite that, they can still glean some nugget of truth from that experience, like the sense of Divine Love. That sense of Divine Love might then inspire the person to be more selfless and to practice more yoga until finally they realize one day that self = other and that self = God. Then their realization will be complete.
</p>

<p>
	My point is, you should allow people a path towards the Absolute without cutting them down at intermediate stages. It's very demotivating and confusing for a spiritual seeker to realize something like Divine Love only to have a callous person tell them something like, "That's all ego delusion."
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if your child came home from 1st grade and showed you the A+ he got on his homework and you responded with, "So what? That's all horse shit. Where is your college diploma? Talk to me when you get your diploma."
</p>

<p>
	It's not realistic to expect everyone to become a Buddha without a lengthy spiritual path. We should allow people to walk their paths, being patient with them and helping them out without cutting them down.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	What I'm telling you is that the situation is more nuanced than that. Mystical experiences -- even if they are not full-blown enlightenment -- are not pure ego or delusion. They can be valuable, truthful, and healing. So don't be so quick to dismiss them.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is not 100% Absolute Truth does not mean it should be dismissed. Much of what we deal with in this work is various degrees of half-truths. That is okay. We shouldn't expect perfection from humans.

<p>
	I would say you're not deeply enlightened because if you were deeply enlightened you'd realize that you are God.
</p>

<p>
	But your experience of that old man, if it really occurred, really occurred, and it may contain some deep truth, such as that you are loved or that God is real. It's just a partial truth.
</p>

<p>
	Most truths are partial truths. Partial truths are still valuable. You can't always expect 100% unadulterated truth. Most people need to do a lot of work before they are ready for that.

<p>
	It's not so simple. Mystical experiences are common and genuine. Of course delusion can surround them too. And they are ALWAYS interpreted through one's stage of Spiral development (which is often as low as Purple or Blue).
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're struggling to understand this is because you're coming at it from a narrow materialist paradigm. Where you are expecting there to be one external physical-like reality which all people see. That's not how reality works. Stuff is more fluid and relative than that. Different people experience different realities. Some people might see an angel while you do not. This does not make the angel any less "real" any more so than you never seeing a kangaroo makes it any less real.

<p>
	Sure you can. You can be more or less aligned with the Truth. Someone like Donald Trump is God, but he is not aligned with it so his power, love, and goodness is very limited. There are many degrees of alignment and embodiment. For example, an awake racist is not fully aligned with the Truth. And yes, there are awake racists, sexists, and so forth. Many people have awoken but stayed at stage Blue ethnocentric. That's very common in the East.
</p>

<p>
	Some folks act more God-like than others, even though of course all folks are God. Hitler did not act very God-like. He was more of a devil. But of course the devil is none other than God. But it's a God which lacks self-awareness that it is God. So what we're talking about is degree of awareness of oneself as God. For example, I know that I am God. But I could be more aware of it than I presently am.

<p>
	The problem with that is that Ramana Maharshi was clearly extremely spiritually gifted. Whether it was genetics or good karma doesn't really matter. He had unique capacities which ordinary people do not have. So comparing yourself to him can be problematic. It's like Arnold saying that benching 500 lbs is a piece of cake. Yeah, for him it is.
</p>

<p>
	If your brain is already in a spiritual configuration, then obviously you don't need yogic techniques which are designed to rewire your brain into a spiritual configuration. If you are 7 feet tall you don't need high heels. Some folks are born 7 ft tall. Some are born spiritual midgets.

<p>
	Yoga has more of a physiological and bodily component to it than meditation or self-inquiry. This is not to say that self-inquiry or meditation are bad, but there is good reason why yogis do all those bodily practices. It really helps with embodying one's enlightenment. There is an energetic component to enlightenment which could easily be missed if all you do is self-inquire. Emotional blockages can reside in the body.
</p>

<p>
	After the drug wears off you are not totally back to normal. Permanent shifts are made. You have to stop thinking of this process of awakening in a binary way of "awake/not awake". There's much more nuance to it.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I think yoga is more powerful than meditation or self-inquiry. But that's my guess and it could vary for person to person. If meditation was as powerful as yoga, yogic techniques would be obsolete and they would not have been invented. That's my guess. It's hard to fairly compare all the techniques because they each require so much training that no one person has mastered them all. Also, no two people have identical capacities.
</p>

<p>
	The point is: keep an open mind and experiment to see what works best for you. I am not trying to convince anyone that yoga is best. It's hard to argue that yoga is not powerful. So it's worth exploring.
</p>

	1) Keep in mind that most people look happy from the outside when in fact they suffer deeply inside and their lives are going down hill. Many celebrities fit this description.
</p>

<p>
	2) It takes time to build up a great thing. Investment is required. For example, starting a business might put you into debt more so than someone working at Starbucks. But in the long-run you will be much wealthier as a business owner.

	3) Learning theory takes time and energy away from practice. Some guy totally focused on practice will achieve more results in the short term but less in the long term.
</p>

<p>
	4) You cannot compare yourself to anyone else. Other people are not in your shoes. They have different abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Some people are "naturals" in certain areas of life which you will have to work your ass off to attain.
</p>

<p>
	5) Progress is highly non-linear. It has ups and downs. Sometimes you must take 1 step back to go 2 steps forward.
</p>

<p>
	You need to have a vision and long time horizon and be patient.
</p>

<p>
	The key word there is CAN.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, how would you know? Have you tried all the techniques? Have you gone all the way? How would you even know what "all the way" is? All you have are stories from gurus. And how do you know which guru is right and which is wrong? Because they certainly don't all say the same thing.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	There are many valid techniques.
</p>

<p>
	But to reach the highest levels will require that you use these techniques with such focus and intensity that it will physiologically change how your brain fires.
</p>

<p>
	You have to consider: your brain physiology puts some hard limits on your degree of consciousness. Which is why psychedelics are so great. They change your brain physiology in such a way that you are able to access states of consciousness which most ordinary brains cannot access without incredible periods of practice, or even at all.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possibility that if your brain was twice bigger your awakening would be deeper in ways that a normal human brain cannot even fathom.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga is specifically designed to change the physiology of your brain. Think of it like doubling the size of your brain. Of course you are not physically doubling its size, you're just changing how it's wired. Which is just as significant. And not just the brain but also the bodily nervous system.
</p>

<p>
	Do not assume that all people or spiritual practitioners have access to the same brain hardware. Not at all. Every brain is unique, with unique pros and cons. Some people's brain hardware is so inadequate they cannot add two numbers together or recognize their mother or father.
</p>

<p>
	People take all this for granted. The reality of how spirituality works is much more complex than most people are willing to admit.
</p>

<p>
	And the paradox is, brains still don't exist <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Tricky, tricky stuff.

<p>
	The mind can get "downloads" from God/Universal Intelligence. These downloads can be verbal or non-verbal. It doesn't really matter what symbols are used. God can "speak" to you through math equations, English, Japanese, ancient Egyptian, colors, an angel, an image of Christ, Ganesha, tea leaves, or a million other things.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's also possible for the ego-mind to be deluded and mistake it's own devilry for communication from God. Alex Jones is a great example of this. So you always have to be careful to distinguish your personal egoic agenda from downloads from Universal Intelligence. It can be tricky to sort this out if one's mind is no sufficiently pure. The devil loves to pretend his own agenda is God's agenda.
</p>

<p>
	As you become more conscious and spiritually attuned, it will feel like you're in communion with God all the time. Hell, you ARE God, so eventually you realize that every thought arising in your mind is how God gets shit done through your body. Really what's going on is that a field infinitely intelligent consciousness is creating reality. This is happening at all times. Every thought you have is part of this field.
</p>

<p>
	As the ego-mind dissolves, God takes over your entire mind and body. Your mind and body become indistinguishable from God. Eventually, if you purify yourself enough, every action you take becomes a movement of the entire universe. Every time your finger moves, the intelligence of the whole universe conspires to move it towards Absolute Goodness and Perfection. The movement of your finger creates Heaven on Earth. Your entire experience of life glows with God's consciousness. You are illuminated. Your will becomes God's Will. You are totally at ONE with God, with zero distance between the two. All duality collapses into Absolute Oneness which knows no opposite. Total self-realization has occurred. Now you finally understand the magnitude what you are. You are Infinity. Your Will is creating the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	No, you must contemplate and observe it very deeply. Only be becoming very familiar with how survival works can you begin to liberate yourself of it.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not conscious of survival in detail, it is controlling your entire life and it is making you an unwitting devil.
</p>

<p>
	The whole problem is that life is NOT a game for you. You take life all too seriously because you're not conscious of what survival is. Life only becomes a game once you are fully conscious of survival. Right now you are a slave of survival. You are a survival robot and you don't even know it yet.

<p>
	Just because you don't have a concept of it doesn't mean you aren't doing it. A squirrel has no concept of survival either, but it's doing it 24/7.
</p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating the depth of this issue of survival. It's worth you contemplating further, rather than dismissing it.
</p>

<p>
	To attain the deepest liberation, survival must be deeply contemplated and observed. Emotional mastery requires consciousness of one's survival mechanisms. 99% of emotions are survival.

	In practice it's not a big threat. Just start with a small dose.
</p>

<p>
	The worst thing you can do as a newbie is take too big a dose. So always err on the side of smaller and you should be okay.

He has no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes. He's still within the materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The stuff I talk about is what the most advanced yogis realize and embody. Total God-realization. You are not going to acheive that with a bit of self-inquiry or meditation. It requires a rewiring of your entire brain and even body. Which is what yogic techniques are designed to do.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like Sadhguru is a good example. He is living in a full state of God-realization.

<p>
	There is no egoic free will, but there is God's infinite Will, and you are God. So it goes full-circle.
</p>

<p>
	Free will vs no-free-will is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	In practice your will is a sliver of God's infinite Will, just like your intelligence is a sliver of God's infinite Intellignece. By becoming more God-like you get more will and more intelligence.

</p>

<p>
	Of course it does not have to be that way. Relationships are great and I'm all for deep intimate spiritual relationships. If you manage to actually pull that off, you'll be a hero in my eyes. That's challenging stuff.

	The rabbit hole goes very deep. There are facets of the Absolute that even most enlightened people have not realized.
</p>

<p>
	This is not just a verbal or stylistic difference. You can realize Nothing but miss Everything. You can realize Everything but miss Nothing. Or you can realize them both at once to see they are identical.
</p>

<p>
	And it does not end there. There's more! There's God, there's Infinity, there's Intelligence, there's Love, there's Eternity, there's Goodness, there's Will, there's Truth, there's Consciousness, there's Paradise, and it still does not end there.
</p>

<p>
	You can spend a lot of time understanding all the above at deeper and deeper degrees of wholeness and interconnection.

<p>
	Do not expect a typical enlightened YouTuber to have that level of total understanding. This is rare, rare stuff. It requires extreme levels of seeking and openmindedness which almost no one has. Neo-advaita is not gonna cut it.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I don't claim to be awake. But I know how deep the rabbit hole goes. It's ironic how many awake people do not. See, this shit is very, very tricky. When you try to boil this work down to a binary categorization like awake/not-awake you over-simplify and distort it. If only it were so simple.

I actually agree with everything you wrote. Life IS brutal, and we only got here off the backs of countless other human and animal lives. Of course! If the natives did not eat animals, they would have died, and whether that's "right or wrong," here we are. Ta-Da! 
		</p>

		<p>
			However, I feel like you may only have part of the story here. While there is a necessary duality of cooperation vs. competition, nature as a whole is predominantly based on cooperation. Our higher light and instincts, while an integration of the two, is something that ultimately transcends human nature. Your example of the two enlightened beings highlighted something that I believe adds another twist to this story. See, two lesser men would probably debate which life was worth more, and if they couldn't reach a consensus (which they wouldn't), it would inevitably turn to a fight to the death. However, we're talking about two enlightened beings. Would they debate which life was worth more? No, that's impossible. Would they fight each other to the death? No. I firmly believe that the only conclusion to be reached, from a nondual universal perspective, is for both to die in peace. I personally would rather go out that way than to live with that on my conscience. There is something here that transcends animal instincts, to appeal to karmic balance.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm not asking you to agree with me, I'm just asking you to seriously consider this possibility. Would you sacrifice your body so that another may live? Would you kill another man so that you may live? You are both the victim and the perpetrator, so only if you answered Yes to both of these questions would your scenario play out... But would it? That's a stalemate! There would be no purpose to any of this nonsense, would there?
		</p>

		<p>
			As an example, remember the brilliant ending sequence of the two ships in <em>The Dark Knight</em>? See, the Joker was convinced that either one of the boats would blow the other up. That's human nature, is it not? And yet, it took a brave prisoner to come forward to do the unthinkable. "I'll do what you should of did a long time ago," as he threw the detonation device out the window. That was the action of an enlightened being. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course it could work that way in the most ideal circumstance. But so what? In real life that is not how 99.9999% of beings behave. I was more interested in showing you how life works.
</p>

<p>
	In practice even the most enlightened people are still forced to navigate life. Even if they don't eat people, they behave selfishly in other less dramatic ways.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, don't over-idealize enlightened people. You will be disappointed when they fail to live up to your utopian fantasies.
</p>

<p>
	You must explain why so many enlightened people act so selfishly, and your answer cannot be: because they aren't really enlightened.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Obviously not. My point is that the arguments humans have are not always small-minded.
</p>

<p>
	Who should control the Middle East? Iranians? Jews? Arabs? The US? That's not a small-minded argument. That's a serious survival issue affecting hundreds of millions of people. How is it going to get resolved? How many people are you willing to sacrifice in order to resolve that situation well? 10 thousand? 100 thousand? 1 million? 10 million?
</p>

<p>
	See, it's not so easy. Life is extremely complex and counter-intuitive. By trying to compromise you might end up getting 10 million people killed.
</p>

<p>
	Are you going to compromise or fight with the big oil companies on global warming? If global warming gets out of hand, millions of people are going to die from starvation, disease, displacement, violence, and civil war.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that small vs big is a duality. Small things lead to big things which lead to giant things. So the small details matter.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hahaha... this kind of naivete is exactly why I said what I said. This is not how life works.
</p>

<p>
	Life ALWAYS works at the expense of other life. You can minimize that to some degree, but you cannot eliminate that totally. Just the fact that you are alive means some other organism cannot be alive. For example, the fact that you were the winning sperm means that millions of other sperm had to die.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you're not yet conscious of the trade-offs and costs of life. Study more closely how life works. Life and death are a duality which necessarily must feed off itself. It's not just an accident that wolves must hunt rabbits to survive and squirrels must hunt acorns. For every acorn that a squirrel eats, that's one potential oak tree that dies. So don't think that squirrels are innocent little creatures. Squirrels are acorn murdering machines.
</p>

<p>
	This needs to be accepted and understood, not avoided or worked around. You must profoundly realize how life and death are intertwined. Otherwise you will be under the illusion that if we could just get rid of death, everything will be peachy. No! The point is to realize that death itself is inevitable. You cannot be alive without dying.
</p>

<p>
	Cooperation and competition are a duality. You cannot have a life of 100% cooperation and zero competition. You must realize how the two co-arise.
</p>

<p>
	You have a self/ego for a very good reason: because you need it to survive. Selfishness plays an important role in life. You cannot just be 100% selfless and stay alive. If that were possible, ego would not be needed and it would not exist. You must realize that selfishness and selflessness are a duality too. You cannot have one without the other.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, we can still work towards a more selfless society. But don't get overly utopian about it. People still gotta shit, eat, make money, fuck, and kill. Be clear-eyed about such realities. Life has hard stakes. Don't take survival for granted. It's very easy to create a sceneario where you will have to kill to survive, and you will. You do it every day. You just conveniently ignore it, because it's not useful to your survival. You are a survival machine first and foremost.
</p>

<p>
	When a Native American hunter killed his prey, he would say a little prayer for taking the animals life. He realized that he had to take the animal's life to sustain his own. That is what it means to be aware of your selfishness. This is not something to feel guilty about. This is something you can turn into a spiritual experience. Survival is a spiritual experience (if you look at it the right way, without taking it for granted).
</p>

<p>
	It's very important to face the brutality of life, rather than trying to avoid it, pretending like it's not there. Life is fucking brutal. Business is brutal. Relationships are brutal. Etc. This brutality is a real test of your capacity to love. Your love can become so strong precisely because life is so brutal. You can cry for every carrot you eat. "Thank you carrot, for giving me your life. I promise to use your energy towards the highest good."
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If two enlightened people are locked in a cage with no food, one of them will likely eat the other one. This is the nature of survival and it is not wrong. It must be accepted and embraced.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to over-idealize or over-romanticize life. People still got to eat, shit, make money, and fuck if society is to exist. Life is Love, but life is also brutal.

<title>Is having good manners and being polite stage green values?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The key thing to understand about good manners and etiquette is that they are all a social construction and a survival function. They are not absolute. The mistake that many stage Blue people make is they take manners, social norms, cultural customs, paying respect, tradition, etc as absolutes, and therefore normative. In other words, you SHOULD and MUST adhere to social norms. This is delusional.
</p>

<p>
	As you become conscious and developed you will naturally respect people without making it a dogma or a should.
</p>

<p>
	Manners, social norms, cultural customs, paying respect, tradition, etc become problematic when they are done mechanically in lieu of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Just understand that whatever your role-models hate or judge, you will probably start to hate or judge too. If your role-model has a shadow, you will tend to absorb their shadow and make it your own. Make sure you're aware of what the speaker's shadow is. His shadow is the place he's reacting from, which lessens his alignment with Truth and Goodness.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that all judgment is delusion. No exceptions.

<p>
	There is no such thing as bad, AT ALL! Bad is an egoic delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Anything which exists is Absolutely Good. Murder included and anything else you can conjure up.
</p>

<p>
	Without an ego you would not be bothered by murder.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: from the perspective of the universe as a whole, nothing can be bad because there is nothing outside the universe to contrast it with. This is one of the radical consequences of ONENESS.

<p>
	No, it makes you understand that all such things are necessary aspects of Absolute Good. You do not become apathetic. You are filled with unconditional love. The love is so deep it may seem like apathy from an egoic perspective because the ego confuses selfishness with love.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

			Because meanwhile it is technically true that the ultimate nature of reality is Good (concuousness / Brahman), that doesn't mean that empathy for those who are suffering and working towards a fully awake human community living as one in harmony peace egalitarianism and altruism suddenly get canceled even if it looks like a tall order now.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's easy for the ego-mind to see Absolute Love and spiritual detachment as apathy. It only appears that way because the ego-mind is so attached.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Love requires detachment because so long as you are attached to anything, your love is highly partial. You cannot love the whole world from a position of attachment. Anything you are attached to means you can't love its opposite. If you are attached to peace, you cannot love war. If you are attached to love, you cannot love hate. If you are attached to justice, you cannot love injustice. If you attached to beauty you cannot love the ugly. Etc. Absolute Love loves EVERYTHING! No exceptions. Anything you don't or can't love, that's ego being scared and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	So you should distinguish between dualistic love (what most people call love) and nondual Love, which knows no opposite and has no boundary.
</p>

<p>
	Like I explained in the Understanding Duality episode, good and bad are relative whereas Good is the transcendent absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The transcendence of good/bad does not leave you in a neutral place the way most people would imagine. It puts you in Heaven.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to how the trascendence of science and religion does not leave you with agnosticism, it makes you God!

<p>
	I don't know who trungpa is.
</p>

<p>
	If a teacher is an asshole, then yeah, I'd say he's got some devil in him. He has more work to do. He can be awake but he has a repressed shadow which needs work.
</p>

<p>
	There are also degrees of awakening. Such a perosn may not have awoken to absolute Love for example, which is why he's still an asshole. It's pretty easy to realize no-self without realizing God or Love or Goodness and be an asshole.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why a good Zen master will drive his students to go deeper after their first kensho. The first kensho is just the beginning. A good master will not let a student stop at the first kensho. There is what's called post-satori practice.
</p>

<p>
	The key issue with nations is the stage of development of their infrastructure. It does not matter what the ideology is so much as what values the infrastructure is embodying. If the courts, police, and politicians are corrupt, and the economy is pre-industrial or only based on one resource like crude oil, and there is no seperation of chruch and state, then no Green government is possible even if a Green ideology is spread to everyone.
</p>

<p>
	It works just like with individual development. Just because you read a lot of books or watch a lot of videos about personal development does not mean you will be highly developed. It's very easy to create a lofty image in your mind of how developed you are when in reality your diet is terrible, your emotions are all over the place, you have a crazy monkey mind, your finacial situation is a disaster, you live in a bad environment, your friends are criminals, etc. Such a person will not be able to function at a high level because the infrastructure is so poor.

<p>
	Yes, the underlying motivation is the key moreso than any particular behavior. You can respectful at any stage of the Spiral. It's just that stage Blue values respect for tradition for its own sake and becomes rigid about it. For example, you must respect the Pope because he is a spokeman for the one true God, Lord Jesus Christ, and he is infallible. By not respecting him you will go to hell. Bow your head before the Pope or we may torture you for being a devil worshipper.

<p>
	No, that concept is straight from Zen itself. Zen masters teach about Zen devils and Yako Zen, aka "wild fox Zen".
</p>

<p>
	Technically, a Zen devil is one who practices Zen without ever reading scriptures. And a wild fox is one who only reads about Zen without practicing.
</p>

<p>
	A Zen devil will say things like, "Who cares about the suffering of others? I am liberated and suffering is an illusion so nothing matters." Or stuff like, "Who cares about global warming? The world is an illusion anyways."
