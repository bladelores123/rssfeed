<title>Can becoming an expert investor be a life purpose?</title>

<p>
	Depends on why you're doing it.
</p>

<p>
	What is the point of your investing?
</p>

<p>
	Also, keep in mind that just because something qualifies as a life purpose doesn't mean it should be YOUR life purpose. Your LP needs to fit you like a glove.

<title>How To Stop Creating Physical Pain?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Strong Determination Sitting is a good way to work on consciousness of pain.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't easy to do, but try to sit for so long that you get to the point where the excruciating pain of your sit turns into pleasure. It's a very distinct inflection point that happens during long, serious sits.
</p>

<p>
	As you sit there in pain for an hour or more, you have ample time to contemplate: What is pain? What is suffering?
</p>

<p>
	With pain and suffering it's very important to try to contemplate it WHILE IT IS HAPPENING, not after the fact. This cuts through speculation and theorizing.
</p>

<p>
	My guess is, you'd have to be pretty deeply enlightened to be able to deconstruct pain in the way Ralston talks about. Because so long as the ego is intact it will bitch and whine and moan and resist too much. A deep surrender is required.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston is talking about super-human levels of consciousness. So don't be discouraged if you can't get it fast.
</p>

<p>
	It might be easier to do this using a much simpler image, like a red triangle or white circle or the yin-yang.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, these might bore you, but if you get bored easily then that's precisely what you must work through. Boredom is the ego-mind's resistance to truth and higher consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Boredom is not easy to work through, but therein lies the spiritual purification.

<title>The Nature of Perceptions</title>

What you presently think of as perception will eventually -- at high levels of consciousness -- get recontextualized into Absolute being.
</p>

<p>
	Perception only appears to exist because the ego is co-opting Absolute being as its own "perceptions".
</p>

<p>
	In truth, you are not perceiving anything. Absolute Infinity is being itself but because you believe you were born, you are misinterpreting Absolute being as "my perceptions of reality".
</p>

<p>
	Without a belief in a separate self, there is no perception. The notion of perception carries with it a hidden implicit metaphysics: subject/object (duality). When you become really conscious, this duality collapses and you realize that perception was never taking place. Absolute being was taking place.
</p>

<p>
	This may sound like a semantic word game, but I assure you its not. It's a very radical and palpable shift in consciousness. You will feel it like getting struck with a lightning bolt. Your whole sense of reality will flip inside out as your consciousness up-shifts from relative perception to Absolute being. Visually, nothing may change, but your understanding of what you thought your visual field was will radically change.
</p>

<p>
	It's like if what you thought was a shrub swaying in the wind, upon closer inspection, turned out to be a creeping grizzly bear <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

Never buy from an unknown source.
</p>

<p>
	And on top of that, use drug testing kits to verify your substance is a genuine indole.
</p>

<p>
	Be especially suspicious of substances which don't look pure (brown, grey, yellow, pink, dirty-looking, chunky, etc.).

<p>
	As far as interpreting imagery goes, the human mind can only understand reality via images and symbols. That's what understanding is regardless of whether it is scientific or spiritual understanding, literal or poetic. There really isn't a difference between literal and poetic understanding. So the mind, especially during a trip, will use whatever images it can to understand the vast complexity of reality. All sorts of strange symbols and images can arise, and they are all relative to that mind's intellectual framework. Truth and wisdom will be communicated in whatever way works FOR THAT MIND. To a Christian mind it might be the face of Jesus, to a Hindu mind it might be the face of Vishnu, to an atheist mind it might be a mathematical formula or a logical axiom, etc.
</p>

<p>
	All of it is just arbitrary symbols which only have meaning relatively, WITHIN the framework of that person's mind. It's like a language, which only makes sense and has meaning to those people who speak the language. To an outsider, it is just noise.
</p>

<p>
	Of course dissociatives can be used for accessing profound mystical states.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is, they tend to be physically harmful to the body, and also addictive.
</p>

<p>
	Ketamine can become very addictive and prolonged usages destroys the kidneys I believe. Which is why I do not recommend them. Why take those risks when you can have mindblowing mystical experiences on totally safe and non-addictive substances like LSD, mushrooms, or DMT?
</p>

<p>
	After a 5-MeO breakthrough, even small doses of LSD or mushrooms will be fully nondual, infinite experiences.
</p>

<p>
	I don't need more than 125ug of LSD to take to me to full God-mode.
</p>

<p>
	With so many safe psychedelics to explore, I would leave dissociatives for last on the list, after you've explored 2C-B, DMT, 5-MeO, MDMA, mushrooms, etc.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, once you try 5-MeO, you will not want anything else. It is a psychedelic in a league of its own. It makes LSD seem like a toy (and LSD is no toy).
</p>

<title>Is becoming socially withdrawn a part of the Self-actualization journey?</title>

<p>
	There are healthy and unhealthy ways to be socially withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
	In the healthy version, you desire isolation so that you can focus on working on your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Many sages have socially withdrawn themselves to high degrees that would seem unhealthy to most people. But they were just hardcore in their practices. This isn't strictly necessary, but it may be for some people for some period of time until they finish their work.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, there is only the one Self, so all those other people are none other than you. So whether you are with people or not, you are still always alone.
</p>

<p>
	There is no problem being alone as long as you enjoy it and you are not becoming more and more depressed or mentally unstable.
</p>

<title>Vanity and Spiral Dynamics</title>

</p>

<p>
	When contemplating this stuff, you must probe beneath the stories and excuses like, "My Dad caused this", or "It was because of my childhood" and get to the root of why you are still attached to it. Attachments like this are always rooted in your survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	So what do you fear will happen to you if you let go of vanity and appearance?
</p>

<p>
	What would happen if you became ugly and everyone thought you were a cheap nasty whore?
</p>

<p>
	How would that hurt your ego/survival? Why are you giving people that power over you?
</p>

<p>
	What is vanity/appearance REALLY giving you? Love? Happiness? Success? Self-esteem?
</p>

<p>
	Hint: it's giving you something positive, otherwise you wouldn't keep doing it.
</p>

<p>
	What if your self-esteem was completely independent of your appearance? What would be bad about that? What if you were ugly and yet you still loved yourself just as much as when you were pretty?
</p>

<p>
	Sit down and really contemplate all that in a brutally honesty manner.
</p>

<p>
	Also, get very specific and clear about what you mean by "vanity" and "appearance", as these are very vague notions.
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness and Infinity are identical. So this Nothingness is infinitely intelligent. That's what you are intuiting but not yet fully grasping.

	P.S. LSD or mushrooms are very good alternatives to 5-MeO. They can show you this too.

<title>The mechanism of creating distinctions</title>

</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, reality cannot have a substance because there is nothing within reality which can be used to as a ground, and no one to arbitrate between any truth claim.
</p>

<p>
	Being cannot know itself precisely because it is itself. Or rather, being can come to know that being is fundamentally groundless and therefore mystical.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be a ground other than emptiness because any other ground would itself be in need of another ground, and so on, ad infinitum.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, the ground vs not-ground is also a distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Here we have reached the end of language. Anything said about the Ultimate Ground (The Groundless Ground) must be self-negating because the ultimate nature of reality is nondual, but all language works by creating dualities (distinctions). So anything we could say or think about the Absolute will be dualistic, which is the opposite of what it is. But... also not the opposite! (See how I have to negate my own words when talking about it?) Because to say anything about it is to give it a specific, distinct quality. But the Absolute is unbounded, infinite. But... also it is bounded and finite! (Again, I have to negate any quality I attribute to it).
</p>

<p>
	This is why Zen is so Zen. The Truth breaks logic and language alike because the Truth is infinite while logic and language are finite.

</p>

<p>
	DO NOT think about what suffering is. OBSERVE what suffering is in your direct experience!
</p>

<p>
	You suffer every day. The next time you suffer, OBSERVE it, and contemplate what you are observing.
</p>

<p>
	Avoid speculating or philosophizing about suffering. You don't need to speculate about it, it's RIGHT THERE every day in your life!
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Not only is it there, you are creating it! Another good question to contemplate is: Why did I create this suffering? Again, avoid speculation. Stick as closely to direct experience as possible.

			I think you haven't tried a good scale yet, or there is some problem with your scale(s). Have you changed the battery? Mine was a bit wonky until I replaced the shit factory battery, now it measures within 1mg consistently.

<p>
	Like I said, I've tried those scales and they never gave me consistent results.
</p>

<p>
	Microscoops are better.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a scale is 0.001g does not mean it can actually measure out 10mg precisely. Most of these scales will barely even register a 10mg dose. It will read as zero on the scale many times. These scales assume you're weighting a fairly heavy object to begin with, like 100mg, then it will give you 0.001g accuracy. But not on a 10mg sample.

<title>Intuitively realizing something behind reality</title>

</p>

<p>
	You can intuit and trust, but none of that it is direct consciousness of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to get lulled into a false sense of comfort with such trust. Billions of religious people do it every day, and it becomes a huge obstacle to awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Trust, but verify.
</p>

<p>
	That's where 5-MeO becomes very handy. It will show you where that trust fully leads.
</p>

<p>
	Right now it's sort of like you're saying, "Yeah, I trust that Japan is a real place. I've never been, but I trust it."
</p>

<p>
	Okay, that's better than distrusting Japan. But it's a whole nother thing to actually go to Japan and roam the streets of Tokyo. It would be a trap to trust in Japan so much that you never actually bother traveling there. None of your ideas about Japan can compare to actually being in Japan.

<title>The mechanism of creating distinctions</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/24783-the-mechanism-of-creating-distinctions/?do=findComment&amp;comment=276960</link>

<p>
	Distinction is a very tricky issue because distinction is the very nature of being.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully understood what a distinction was, you would understand the ultimate nature of reality, and you would be deeply enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Distinction is NOT a concept!</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Distinction is the "substance" of reality. And what then is the nature of a distinction? Nothing!
</p>

<p>
	Yes, paradox here is not a mistake. What you're starting to intuit is that reality has no substance. It's a set of distinct appearances which are actually just a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not made out of matter or atoms or energy. Reality is made out of distinctions!
</p>

<p>
	Creation is distinction. Without distinction you have pure formless Infinity. And with distinction, you also have pure Infinity! The formed side of Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Form is formlessness. Formlessness is form.
</p>

<p>
	Duality is none other than nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity contains an infinite number of distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	It's highly worthwhile to contemplate: What is a distinction?
</p>

<p>
	-------
</p>

<p>
	Mind vs not-mind = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Automatic vs not automatic = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness vs unconsciousness = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Real vs unreal = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Subjective vs objective = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Truth vs falsehood = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Creation vs destruction = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	The universe vs me = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	------
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the substanceless substance within which all of these distinctions occur. Like an LCD screen on which images are rendered.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you've ever seen or thought or experienced is a distinction. Including existence itself.
</p>

<title>A few problems with the Clare Graves / Spiral Dynamics model</title>

<p>
	SD is a complex model which requires serious study and contemplation to understand fully.
</p>

<p>
	All of these issues you brought are up only apparent issue because you haven't fully understood the model yet and you are not quite properly interpreting history. For example America was not more Green in the 60's than today. That is confusing the hippie movement with the average level of the entire country. In the 60's America was heavy Blue/Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Atheists are not Blue, they are just stubbornly Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Each stage builds on all the prior ones, so there is no contradiction in a Green or even Turquoise person starting a business. Business takes place at every stage, just following different values.

Those milligram scales are still way too imprecise. They cannot properly measure a 10gm dose. To them, 10mg to 20mg all feels the same. I have used several different milligram scales and they are all terrible.

<p>
	Teachers have different styles. This is why its good to study hundreds of different perspectives. Each one will expose you to some new facet that the other ones didn't.
</p>

<p>
	Teachers place different emphasis on things due to their unique personality, cultural background, path through life, and even their gender or level of testosterone.
</p>

<p>
	Never expect one teacher to explain everything to you. It just isn't possible.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, finding a teacher who you resonant with perfectly is bad because then you will tend to blindly accept what he/she says without thinking for yourself or considering other sources.
</p>

<p>
	Focus more on grasping what is being taught in your direct experience rather than daydreaming about or judging the teacher.
</p>

<p>
	The teacher you resonate with very much depends on what your particular needs are at this moment in time. In a few years, as your needs change, so will your teachers -- if you don't commit yourself to worshiping just one.
</p>

<p>
	My teachings are definitely not complete, and definitely contain some mistakes and shadow. This is not a problem so long as you think for yourself, make use many sources, and do your reading. Just listening to me is not enough to succeed in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Although of course most people reading his books have no idea what he's really pointing to, or ever do the practice he suggests. He sort of obscures the practice with all his smartassery and story-telling.

The only thing is that you haven't really gone all the way yet. You got a small glimpse, but not the Full Monty.
</p>

<p>
	When plugging, it's very important to make sure that your bowels are empty, otherwise the substance will not absorb fully.
</p>

<p>
	Measuring 5-MeO using a micro-scoop is far superior than using a scale. Scales are just not sensitive enough. Get a micro-scoop on Amazon (like this: <a href="https://amzn.to/2oguKiE" rel="external nofollow">https://amzn.to/2oguKiE</a> ) and use the same micro-scoop each time so your doses are consistent.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you might need to smoke it to get the Full Monty. Or just increase your plugged dose.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, at high doses, it gets freaky.
</p>

<p>
	But having that Fully Monty breakthrough is paramount. Until then, you still don't understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	Doing it with Octavio should definitely get you a breakthrough. Smoking is MUCH more intense than plugging. Plugging is like a walk in the park compared to smoking it. With smoking, the ego should not be able to hold on or resist in any way.
</p>

<p>
	Because no one would buy it if it said, "You gotta do 10,000 hours of work".
</p>

<p>
	People want easy answers. That is what sells.
</p>

<p>
	The popularity of your product/service in the marketplace is directly proportional to how easy and effortless you make your solution sound.
</p>

<p>
	"Enlightenment In 15 Minutes" << That's the video every fool clicks on.
</p>

<p>
	The most serious teachers, who emphasize hard work, are the ones you'll never hear of because they are not mass market.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: The Deep Problem of Marketing.
</p>

<p>
	To sell enlightenment effectively, you gotta simplify it and dumb it down to the point that hardly anyone who listens to you will ever attain it.
</p>

<p>
	If a guru told you what enlightenment really is, no one would buy it.

<p>
	The LP Course is very strategic.
</p>

<p>
	But it is not a course about strategic thinking per se.
</p>

<p>
	It is the only course I have.

<title>What causes ‘unhealthy’ memes to develop?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Identity creates attachment and clinging, which is sort of the definition of dysfunction.
</p>

<p>
	America has plenty of unhealthy strict Blue too. Look at the Catholics, Evangelicals, and Mormons.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever a meme is turned into an ideology, into "the truth", it becomes toxic because all memes are partial and limited. They are never the full Truth.
</p>

<title>Disagree with some of Leo's advice</title>

<p>
	I guess I should have been more clear: solving the master does not merely mean enlightenment. It means solving the entire maze of your life, which is a far greater undertaking than just enlightenment. It includes mastery of relationships, career/biz, finances, art, health, emotions, etc. Even an enlightened perosn still needs to figure this stuff out, or at least to figure out that he is renoucing them.
</p>

<p>
	Mastering the maze requires detailed knowledge of the maze, which can only be acquired through books. I don't just mean spirituality books. You don't need to read 300 spirituality books.
</p>

<p>
	Therapy can of course be useful. For some people it is an important step in their path in escaping the maze.
</p>

<p>
	I am supportive of therapy. It just isn't sufficient by itself to resolve the maze.

<title>7 Pillars of Strategic Thinking: Concentration of Force</title>

Internal vs external is a conceptual duality.
</p>

<p>
	Generally-speaking, competition is a bad strategy for life. Be a creator, not a competitor. All competitors eventually lose because there's always a bigger fish. In the time and energy you waste competing you could have created something beautiful and valuable.
</p>

<p>
	I explain all this in the Life Purpose Course.
</p>

<p>
	Competition is such a limiting paradigm. You are fighting a war which does not need to be fought. Which is the greatest strategic blunder.
</p>

<p>
	This was obvious from the day one, even to most establishment Republicans. Trump's entire life/career is a house of cards held together with lies. From his fake hair to his fake bone spurs to his fake news to his fake university to his fake charity to his fake wife. Everything in Trump world is a cheap fake. That is Trump entire MO. Fake, fake, fake your way to the bank.

<p>
	I see you guys are not actually contemplating what ideology is.
</p>

<p>
	Ideology is NOT the entire domain of thought!
</p>

<p>
	One can think and conceptualize without being ideological about it.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with lumping all thought and speech into ideology, as if there is only nonduality or ideology.

</p>

<p>
	He just represents the healthiest aspects of Blue/Green. Don't forget that Blue & Green can be very healthy. They don't have to be raving lunatics.
</p>

<p>
	What Rogers is speaking against in that video is Orange vulgarity. Orange is all for showing tits and violence on TV for the sake of profits. Which Rogers would have a serious problem with because of his Blue values of propriety and decorum.
</p>

<p>
	Just his manner of speaking is Blue Blue Blue. Formal and proper.
</p>

<p>
	"Protect our innocent children" is a common trope for Blue and Green stages.

	That's like kicking yourself in the nuts just to learn the lesson that you shouldn't ever kick yourself in the nuts.
</p>

<p>
	I guess for some people that is an important lesson to learn. But one would hope you'd have enough foresight to deduce the lesson without having to actually kick yourself.

</p>

<p>
	You assume that to be enlightened is something the ego-self acquires. Which is of course a false assumption. Just stop assuming that. You were told from the very beginning that you are an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	I don't understand people who learn this and then start to exclaim that you cannot be enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	To say that you became enlightened never meant that ego acquired enlightenment. It always meant that ego dissolved and empitness dawned. That is what becoming enlightened means.
</p>

<p>
	Why quibble over something so obvious?

Those skiers likely shot full of steroids and all sorts of chemicals.
</p>

<p>
	Pretty much all Olympic athletes use chemicals and game anti-doping tests.
</p>

<p>
	No Olympic performance is to be trusted as natural or healthy.

<p>
	I would actually prefer to eat pure sugar over wheat.

</p>

<p>
	Wheat is just empty calories. Why do you think everyone eats it? It's cheap empty calories. That is all. It has no nutritional value. You might as well just eat spoonfuls of white sugar. At least the sugar won't cause autoimmune reactions.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't rocket science. Just basic common sense. You are fed wheat for the same reason cows and chickens are feed grain. It's the cheapest fuel there is.
</p>

<p>
	Peasants, soldiers, slaves, prisoners, and animals are fed bread. That's what makes society run. Not oil, grain.

<p>
	That's the problem right there.
</p>

<p>
	Your business has no actual meaning for you, despite outward appearances.

<p>
	Business must be designed to serve some higher purpose than money.
</p>

<p>
	You don't actually have a life purpose yet. Making money is not a life purpose.

<p>
	You are simply lost in mental-masturbation.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing you imagine or reason about the Absolute is correct because all reason and imagination is illusion.
</p>

<p>
	So you can sit there and reason for 1000 years, but you will still misunderstand because the entire domain you're operating within is illusory and you are not conscious of it.
</p>

<p>
	No amount of reasoning can substitute for consciousness. Because consciousness is a 1st order thing and reasoning is a 2nd order thing.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be an ant pondering whether anyone can truly know calculus.
</p>

<p>
	An ant can't. But a higher consciousness being can. The solution is to stop being an ant.
</p>

<p>
	Reasoning about not being an ant is not the same thing as actually not being an ant. Which is why you cannot think your way into Truth. You must realize the futility of thinking if Truth is your goal.
</p>

<p>
	After all, nowhere in the universe is it written that thinking will get you to Truth. The Truth is under no obligation to conform to your reasoning or to make any logical sense to you. In fact, if the Truth made logical sense, it would not be the Truth.

<p>
	Seems to me like you're thinking about this too narrowly, too externally.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of boxing your goal is not really to beat some opponent, your ultimate goal is to become a good boxer (let us say).
</p>

<p>
	In which case, you start to strategize on that goal. How do you concentrate your limited time, energy, and resources to make yourself a good boxer over the next year? Perhaps you identify that your greatest undeveloped asset is stamina. You sense that you could outlast other boxers in the ring. But you'd need to train up your stamina to do it. And so that's where you decide to focus your energy. So you do lots of cardio training, etc.

<p>
	Alternatively, you could determine that the best strategy would be to hire an exceptional boxing coach. So you spend your energy and resources looking for the best coach you can find, in the hope that he will give you that extra edge that you need to win.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to competition, you need to find some unique thing that will set you apart from everyone else. Maybe that means you train twice as long each day, or you develop amazing legwork, or you find an exceptional rare coach, or you do lots of visualization, or you learn to meditate in the ring, or you study lots of boxing videos to learn new moves, or you do yoga to raise your baseline level of consciousness, etc.

	This is true of all categories and all human thought.

<p>
	The principles of successful dating are timeless. They do not change.
</p>

<p>
	The larger question is, why are you dating at all? For what purpose? That's where things can start to change.
</p>

<p>
	If all you care about is hooking up, the methods for that are well-documented across the internet.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can make a copy-cat business but it's a bad strategy. It will be hard to market and eventually you will go out of business unless you bring something new to the table.
</p>

<p>
	A Seth Godin says, you must create a Purple Cow.
</p>

<p>
	The bigger picture of business that people fail to see is that marketplaces are constantly evolving and self-optimizing. If you offer something of genuine value, then you will be optimized out of the marketplace by evolutionary forces.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot go copy Bill Gates or Elon Musk. You must bring something new to the table.
</p>

<p>
	Practically what this means is, you cannot create a good business using a cookie-cutter business-in-a-box plan. This is why get-rich-quick-schemes and multi-level-marketing schemes fail. What you cannot do is follow a 1-2-3 step formula for creating wealth, because if you could, everyone could do it, but that cannot happen by definition because wealth depends on a disparity between you and other people in society. So you must offer more genuine value than other people offer. You must differentiate yourself from the poor and maintain that differentiation.
</p>

<p>
	I say this specifically because there are a lot of tempting business-in-a-box plans out there. But the ones who get rich off those are the ones selling the plans, not the ones buying the plans.
</p>

<p>
	No one can sell you a plan for how to create something like Actualized.org, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Uber, Ebay, Tesla, Amazon, SpaceX, etc. Because the plan itself is the whole value of the company. And the plan is always time-sensitive. You cannot create another Amazon today. That ship has sailed.
</p>

<p>
	The more original your plan, the more money you stand to make, the greater your competitive advantage.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can still study all these great companies and learn lessons and gain inspiration for building your own.
</p>

<p>
	It's a non-ordinary realm of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Since reality is a hallucination at all times, the hallucination can have various domains or realms like waking, dreaming, astral realms, DMT hyperspace, mushroom realms, computer simulations, schizophrenic hallucinations, hellscapes, heavenly realms, etc.
</p>

<p>
	There's really no limit to what The Great Mind can hallucinate.
</p>

<p>
	"Ordinary physical reality" is just one realm out of many. It only seems "real" because you haven't experienced any other realms yet, so you have nothing to contrast it with.
</p>

<p>
	Well... you experience the dream realm every night, but your mind dismisses that as "just dreams".
</p>

<p>
	See, it's hard to experience the non-ordinary realms if you don't take them seriously. That's where openmindedness comes in handy.
</p>

<p>
	You categorize and group reality all the time. That's pretty much what all knowledge, language, and science is. You just take it for granted.
</p>

<p>
	You group people in male vs female, black vs white, conservative vs liberal, moderate vs radical, conscious vs unconscious, sane vs insane, friend vs foe, etc.
</p>

<p>
	What you're really objecting to is a new set of categories which you are not comfortable with yet.
</p>

<p>
	For some reason you have no problem when a scientist groups subatomic particles into quarks, leptons, antimatter, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber is enlightened and he talks about Spiral Dynamics and other groupings all the time in a very healthy and reasonable way.
</p>

<p>
	Without grouping, there is no science or math.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is a complex and nuanced set of categories which requires many hours of study to understand.
</p>

<p>
	It would help if you distinguished between healthy and unhealthy application of categories. And also if you remained mindful that all categories are human projections.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I read a few pages of Maps Of Meaning but couldn't bother reading any more. It would be a waste of my time. Hundreds of pages of academic talk which sound deep but are actually pretty shallow.
</p>

<p>
	I have hundreds of books on my bookshelf which I have to be very selective about. These days, most of the books I buy I cannot read because they are just written by people who are too low consciousness for me. I read a chapter or two and basically throw it away.
</p>

<p>
	Once in a while I stumble upon a really brilliant book written by a genius. But this is getting rarer and rarer. I sometimes wonder why I even read at all, since at this point I can basically derive all the deepest truths of life simply through contemplation using my journal.
</p>

<p>
	But I still read, holding out hope for some rare brilliant gem.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible to know and not read, and to read and not really know. Most of modern academia is just book smarts without any deep wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	Just consider, the time you invest watching JP videos about Biblical myths might be better spent contemplating your direct experience. Or not. Discover what works for you at your level.
</p>

<p>
	If JP works for you, have at it. Personally, I have bigger fish to fry.

<description><![CDATA[

<p>
	I understand where you're at. I was in a similar place about 10 years ago when I started doing business.
</p>

<p>
	It's not really important what my business was. Business is basically all the same: you look for new opportunities in the marketplace which are emerging, and you seize on them. It's not a good idea to copy others in business, since your success in biz depends very much on you innovating and finding new opportunities. You cannot do the things I did 10 years ago today. You need to find new opportunities. There are always tons of new biz opportunities emerging every year. But people get so preoccupied doing what everyone else is doing that they miss it. They overlook that simple point that business success is about leadership, not following the herd. Those who follow the herd in business ultimately fail.
</p>

<p>
	The whole key to business is to do lots of research and be creative and original. You must connect new dots.
</p>

<p>
	You can take various seminars, workshops, and video courses to learn the fundamentals of biz, sales, and marketing. That is very important. But then you must have the courage to go find your own unique niche. Business-in-a-box solutions do not work. If they did, every fool would be a millionaire. The whole point is that you cannot do that. You must bring something truly new to the table, which takes cleverness, which is rare.
</p>

<p>
	Be very careful doing business purely for money. Find a way to align yourself with your life purpose as soon as humanly possible.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be surprised! People actually can pay you to sit in darkness. Ever heard of Dark Room retreats? Someone's making money off that. You can literally earn money locking people in a dark room as long as you know how to convince them its good for them <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	The best advice I can give to entrepreneurs is: learn the theory of biz & marketing and then do tons of research. If you do enough research, you will eventually stumble upon your niche.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. The highest income I ever earned came AFTER I fully aligned myself with my life purpose, not when I was chasing money.
</p>

<p>
	P.P.S. I have a video about Small Business advice: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/the-psychology-of-small-business-success" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/articles/the-psychology-of-small-business-success</a>

	Starting a business will be the one of the hardest things you'll do in your life. But the rewards more than compensate for it. Business is not for everyone. To succeed in business you must be a bit of a wolf and you must have ambition.

<title>Heard of Ormus? Consciousness Tool Or Total Scam?</title>

<p>
	With stuff like this, you will never know until you try it.
</p>

<p>
	That's what experimentation and research is. It always involves risks, but also potential for great payoffs.
</p>

<p>
	I do use colloidal silver and colloidal gold. Not sure about the above product though.
</p>

<p>
	In this case it would be very easy to validate or falsify this product. Buy it and try it for a month and see if you notice any changes. If your mindfulness skill is high you should notice some changes. If not, then it doesn't work and you can move on to testing other stuff.
</p>

<title>If everything is The Truth, then falsehood doesn't exist</title>

<p>
	You have to distinguish between verbal/conceptual truth and Truth as Being.
</p>

<p>
	There is no opposite to Truth as Being.
</p>

<p>
	Falsehood is a concept, which results from the imagination imagining something which is not currently present in direct experience, without being aware that that imaginary thing is actually an existing object (an idea) within direct experience, and is therefore technically a part of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason you can say that a unicorn isn't true is because it is True, but your mind is confusing what a unicorn is.
</p>

<p>
	A classic example of confusing the map for the territory.
</p>

<p>
	In Truth, there are no maps. There is only pure territory.
</p>

<p>
	The pure territory is the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	No, hippies are not Blue at all. They are Green.
</p>

<p>
	Blue dresses formally, properly, in uniforms and clean cut suits and dresses. Blue is all about maintaining up-tight order.
</p>

<p>
	Green is much more laided back and easy-going, wearing flip-flops and loose clothing.

It's a rough average and depends a lot on circumstances. A stage Yellow person could be diagnosed with cancer while a stage Green person might find a great job, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Scandinavian countries rank some of the highest on the world happiness index.
</p>

<p>
	There are no stage Yellow societies or governments so we don't have a ranking for countries above Green. The prediction is they will rank higher than Green when they do emerge.

</p>

<p>
	He speaks of God way too theoretically and indirectly. As if he read about it in a book.
</p>

<p>
	He is not a mystic, he is an academic with some Christian leanings.

<title>Building Backlinks - Question</title>

That's the whole point. It's a full-time job and it's quite tedious to do.
</p>

<p>
	I would focus more on content and other forms of marketing. For example, getting on popular podcasts is good for getting your name out there. Or writing guest blog posts. Or giving public speeches.
</p>

<p>
	There is no easy solution to marketing. Marketing is hard, time-consuming, and expensive because it is so valuable.
</p>

<p>
	It's also very hard to market something which isn't Purple Cow. Make sure you're bringing something new to the table.
</p>

<p>
	Success in business requires extreme creativity. You cannot just copy what other people did. You must innovate. You are being paid to innovate, and if you cannot do that, then your business will not succeed.
</p>

<p>
	Your job, as CEO, is to come up with new original strategies. That's why they pay you the big bucks (or at least they will if you succeed). This is why only highly ambitious and extraordinary people can start businesses. Most people only know how to paint by numbers and follow others. Entrepreneurship is about leadership. You gotta find cutting-edge emerging opportunities in the marketplace and creatively exploit them.
</p>

<p>
	No one can tell you what these new original strategies are. Because if they knew, they'd have your job. You gotta do lots of research and connect dots.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It was my passion and purpose for many many years.
</p>

<p>
	Then when I actually started doing it, I saw that it didn't quite suit me. I had a thirst for something deeper. Game development is fun and very interesting (and I'm still passionate about it to some extent), but I needed something deeper. Which turned into my quest for metaphysical understanding, self-actualization, and enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose evolves. It never starts out clear and perfect. You start with your best guess, you pursue it, and then you adjust on the fly. Sometimes large adjustments are needed, like quitting your entire career. Which is what I did. Twice!
</p>

Because he has not yet developed eco-consciousness so the health of the environment is beyond his circle of concern.
</p>

<p>
	Green's care for the environment goes beyond just saving money. Green actually cares about the environment for its own sake. Green has developed heart, which Orange cannot understand because Orange is too self-centered.

<p>
	Building artificial backlinks is not a good idea these days. Google is smart about catching you and penalizing you for it.
</p>

<p>
	You can actually get your website blacklisted forever if you build too many artificial backlinks.
</p>

<p>
	That era to do that kind of stuff was 10 years ago. Google has gotten a lot smarter.
</p>

<p>
	No-follow links don't count at all, and making links on blog comment sections is a no-no these days. Google knows what you're doing. Quality links must come from the body of the page, not the comment section.
</p>

<p>
	These days I would assume that almost all social media links are no-follow. Which means they don't count.
</p>

<p>
	You are misunderstanding Green.
</p>

<p>
	Don't give Green a bad name.
</p>

<p>
	Green can be very healthy. In fact, mostly it is. Only in rare exceptions does it get toxic. These days people in the political sphere love to demonize Green and over-exaggerate Green's excesses. If you use the news or YT political commentary to judge Green, you will get a very distorted picture of Green.
</p>

<p>
	80%+ of Green people are moderate and easy-going.

			Could he be back to buying nice things for himself once he reaches yellow?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Green never really stops buying nice things. If anything, Green buys fewer but nicer things. Green people love expensive Apple products and expensive yoga pants, for example.
</p>

<p>
	Green just realizes that happiness is found more in relationships than in material objects.
</p>

<p>
	Don't over-simplify Green as being against material objects. Healthy Green is not against those things. In fact, Green should realize that life cannot work without material objects. It's just that Green understands that material objects are not what life is about.
</p>

<p>
	Green is also conscious of how buying up useless material objects affects the environment in unhealthy ways. So Green will be mindful of what they consume whereas Orange doesn't give a shit as long as it suits them.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Orange will drive a Hummer and doesn't care about how much gas he burns. Green will prefer to drive a Tesla. Tesla is a nice, expensive material object. But it is also eco-friendly.
</p>

<p>
	Green buys nice material objects, but for different reasons than Orange.
</p>
