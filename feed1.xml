	DPT will not detox your heavy metals if you got them.
</p>

<p>
	You should look into heavy metal detox protocols. Especially the chemical DMSA.

<p>
	It's all love. There's nothing wrong with surviving. The problem is when you get so preoccupied with survival that it backfires on you.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees and qualities of survival.

<p>
	Horniness is one's desire to have sex on any given day. (Do you want to have sex every day?)
</p>

<p>
	How deeply one enjoys sex is a totally different issue.
</p>

<p>
	Given the food analogy, horniness = hungry. Are you hungry right now?

<p>
	Of course the devil/ego sees love as weakness. Love is the ego's greatest fear.
</p>

<p>
	Those who have been wounded and hurt (Redpill people, etc) then spend the rest of their life acting as though they don't need or want love, because it's too painful for them too admit how much they have been denied love and how deeply they want it.
</p>

<p>
	It's a fake front to defend against facing the pain of not receiving love.

<p>
	Replace hate and judgment with understanding and love.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry about what others are doing. Focus on how you radiate love or succumb to fear. Take ownership of yourself and let others do the same. It is a huge trap to try to change others. That is a distraction from your own work.
</p>

	I suppose on some fundamental level I get a thrill out of saying shocking and outrageous things. I like speach which is provocative and bold, not mealy-mouthed.

<p>
	Because the world is rapidly evolving but people are stubborn and refuse to evovle their ways of thinking to adapt to the change.
</p>

<p>
	It's a form of denial of reality. A form of sticking one's head in the sand by yelling loudly and blaming others. People wish for a return to good old times which were never that good and which can never return. But they can stomach hearing that. So they keep hittinf their heads against the wall.
</p>

<p>
	And in the meantime government becomes stuck and ineffective. Effective gov requires facing tough truths head on.

	Very odd
</p>

<p>
	Maybe your body is immune to it entirely given your genetics/metabolism.

<p>
	Of course are levels of Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot not be levels of the Absolute. Otherwise it would be finite and limited.
</p>

<p>
	There are more levels than you can stomach traversing. It is endless.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you call liberation, there is far more to be conscious of. Liberation is not the same as Infinite Consciousness.

	It doesn't work without crazy concentration which alters your state of consciousness.

<p>
	The key is the crazy concentration, not the question. Without concentration the question is worthless.

<p>
	They are valuable, but one 5-MeO breakthrough is worth 5 retreats.
</p>

<p>
	Why listen to some guru prattle on about awakening when you can just awaken in 15 mins and experience it yourself? It's a no-brainer.
</p>

<p>
	I talk about orgasms all week long to you, or I can just give you an orgasm and you'll instantly understand.

			I wouldn't say 5-MeO builds up energy - although it is very energetically intense (hard to explain). It's much more about releasing stored and repressed energy, untying knots etc. The vibrations that I experience with 5-MeO feel like i'm shedding off layers of energy. There isn't any orgasmic bodily sensations like in the video you linked (at least I haven't experienced them), but there is Bliss. I have had permanent, lasting changes to my entire sense of being from 5-MeO, but there is still much more to work on.

	I found a new psychedelic which is similar in potency to 5-MeO-DMT but has a super-erotic and sexual energy. I've almost had female-like orgasms on it.

<p>
	Years and years of constant practice in your mind and in front of a camera.
</p>

<p>
	Most of my practice is done purely in my mind. Every day. For 20 years.
</p>

<p>
	I'm constantly framing and explaining things to an imaginary person in my mind.
</p>

<p>
	But then you also need live speaking experience which you can get by speaking to a live camera or joining Toastmasters and attending weekly meetings.

<title>Stage Turqoise, Shunyamurti: Nobody has gotten liberation from plant medicine</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Again, this confuses things.
</p>

<p>
	The claim is not that psychedelics will get you liberation. The claim is that they give you access the highest levels of consciousness (temporarily) which are virtually impossible to access otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	To say that Terence McKenna wasn't liberated doesn't mean shit. Tons of people who meditate or do yoga or do self-inquiry or Zen aren't liberated either. And virtually no one at Shunyamurti's retreat center is liberated.
</p>

<p>
	It's ironic that liberated teachers denounce psychedelics as ineffective yet they do so at a retreat/workshop which they sell and hold every year which fails to liberate anyone who attends it.
</p>

<p>
	If you're going to criticize psychedelics for failing to liberate, fine. But then I get to trash your retreat/workshop by that same logic.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you get from attending retreats/workshops or listening to gurus, psychedelics will give it to you faster and more directly. THAT is the key point. And you don't have to pay $2000 for it.
</p>

	From mathematics we know that a sine wave is a desription of periodic (circular) motion.

<p>
	Sine, cosine, and tangent fuctions are derived from the unit circle. Basic trigonometry.

<p>
	I think you underestimate him. He has contemplated many things by himself. He's even had some mild mystical experiences. It's just that it's hard to question/deconstruct one's entire mind. That would be a very rare accomplishment.

<p>
	As an academic of course he's trapped in academic psychology group-think. But that is par for the course. Don't expect an academic to be some Buddha or sage.

<title>How can &quot;I&quot; sense &quot;me&quot; if I'm not here?</title>

<p>
	The key is to realize that nothingness is self-aware. Everything is self-aware because it is consciousness/Truth.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that there is no you. It's more a question if what the true you is. Right you think you are a biological organism, the body/mind. This is the false you. The true you includes all that but is fundamentall reality itself.
</p>

<p>
	You are reality. The body/mind appears within reality. You have mistakenly created a limited identity by attaching to the body/mind exclusively while forgetting that you are reality itself.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is consciousness dreaming up humans, trees, rocks, cars, stars, animals, universes, etc. Like in a dream, the body isn't you because the entire dream is you.
</p>

<p>
	You are an Infinite Mind dreaming up a body and a world. This Infinite Mind has no substance or physical ground. It is an empty field that can dream up physical objects.
</p>

<title>Radical Openmindedness about Self-Acceptance</title>

<p>
	But what you don't appreciate is that by suppressing genuine urges they don't stay suppressed, they bubble up in neurotic ways.
</p>

<p>
	I would suggest that if you had a genuine urge to kill or rape people, you would already be a murder or rapist. You already have to be damaged to have those kind of urges seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality also doesn't mean acting out all your passing urges. Sometimes I get the urge to eat a pizza, but I walk by the pizzaria and tell myself, "No, I will regret it." It is possible to resist an urge in a healthy way.
</p>

<p>
	Fine. Go do it.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of these as unhealthy or egoic things. Frame it as: "I'm working of my career/biz, on having a house, on being financially independent, on building skills, on attracting mates, on dating, on sexuality, on relationships, or physical fitness, on becoming a stronger person, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can pursue these things in a healthy way. Distinguish between toxic Orange and healthy Orange.
</p>

<p>
	You are so young you can hit Orange hard for the next 5-10 years. It also doesn't mean to abandon your metaphysical/spiritual interests during that time. You can still read, meditate, contemplate, do some psychedelics, etc.

My trips are far more cerebral than bodily, although I do sometimes vibrate and work out kinks in the body. But all that is just to get the body out of the way to go deeper with insight and understanding.
</p>

<p>
	People are different so they trip differently. Martin makes a big deal out of the energetic yoga stuff but that is his style/bias. I don't trip that way at all. I go into silent contemplation.

	That's the beauty of it. 5-MeO-DMT is imaginary.

	The point is to avoid breaking the hospital system and to buy time to increase teating capacity, PPE, and ultimately a vaccine.

<p>
	Massive testing is necessary which takes time to manufacture.

<title>6 years of self-actualization was a waste of time</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/48472-6-years-of-self-actualization-was-a-waste-of-time/?do=findComment&amp;comment=615876</link>

<p>
	Firstly, it wasn't a waste of time. The lessons you learned will serve you for the rest of your life. It will keep paying dividends.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, it's important to do this work without making it a chore. It has to align with your passions. Don't do it if you aren't passionate about.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like this work is too advanced for you. You probably have lower stages of the Spiral to work on, which means Tier 1 teachings like basic self-help, biz, relationships, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You won't be able to go for advanced spiritual work unless you take care of your more basic desires and burn through some karma.
</p>

<p>
	The stuff I teach nowadays is extremely advanced and not suitable for many people who struggle with meeting basic needs.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, there are much worse ways you could have used your time.
</p>

<p>
	Fourthly, don't underestimate how much you grew in those 6 years. It's easy to forget how ignorant, selfish, and foolish you were back them. Growth happens and is then taken for granted.
</p>

<p>
	Fifthly, you are allowed to have friends and relationships.
</p>

<p>
	No, not necessarily.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible for you to generate a lot of value for the world using your labor and creativity.
</p>

<p>
	Wealth is not a zero-sum game. Society is constantly getting wealthier as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	You can invent a new product or start a new business which adds genuine value to mankind, thus generating wealth. This doesn't just benefit you, it can benefit mankind and your employees.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if I didn't create Actualized.org, then it would not exist and people would not get the educational value they get from it. I would be much less wealthy and you guys would also be worse off. The wealth it generates for me is a fraction of the value is adds to mankind.

	Being rich comes naturally once you turn yourself into a massive value provider. Then your riches are not about taking from others but giving to others.
</p>

<p>
	Give so much of yourself that you never have to worry about money again. That is my attitude.

<p>
	I've experimented with sexual hypnosis. I made my ex-girlfriend have a minute-long orgasm via skype just by talking to her, no touching.
</p>

<p>
	I can make a girl have a deeper orgasm via text message than she's ever had with a guy in real life.
</p>

<p>
	Amazing things are possible if you take your sex seriously.

<p>
	Spreading misinformation.
</p>

<p>
	When someone comes here and speaks about God as if they understand what they are talking about -- when it's obvious to me that they have never been directly conscious of God -- I will shut that stuff down. It would be like allowing some rando to walk into a university classroom and starts stridently talking about astrophysics when he clearly has no experience in astrophysics. We are not going to entertain such foolishness here.

			I know but it's not really about the money really, it's about helping humanity awaken. I am 100 percent sure that if science could prove psychic abilities under the influence of 5-MEO-DMT that it would lead to many people on the path of psychedelics and 5-MEO-DMT. Just think about how much suffering you could end in doing this. That is a noble respectable challenge.

</blockquote>

<p>
	When you are that woke, there is no one to help awaken. There is only you, and you are fully awake and perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Science cannot prove paranormal abilities because science is paradigm locked, not because the proof is lacking. Science is in denial about the proof. So the problem is in the scientists minds.
</p>

<p>
	Paranormal abilities have been proven statistically beyond any doubt. But a materialist cannot accept it. You can't prove a thing to a person who insists on denying its possibility.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	When I am that conscious, the notion of money makes no sense. Money is a joke when you are God-woken.
</p>

<p>
	James Randi is a hallucination in your mind.

<p>
	You have to appreciate that many people who get into psychedelics are deeply dysfunctional misfits who have a ton of trauma and shadow issues. This creates a warped sample. That's why there are so many bad trip reports and little enlightenment.

	JP does say intelligent and insightful things. I've gleaned insights from him. It's just that his worldview is quite twisted up by his ego and shadow. You have to be very selective and not fall for his right-wing meta-narratives. But some of his psychology lectures are good.

	Do 100 trips of 5-MeO-DMT and you will understand.

	I gave you a simple, empirical method for testing my claims. If you don't want to do science, that's not my problem.
</p>

<p>
	My empirical method is very clear and precise for anyone who is serious. Until other gurus, it requires no belief in me. That's the beauty of it. It's pure science.

	There's no single solution here for everyone. You must find whatever you're comfortable with and capable of handling. For some people this will mean tons of sex, for others it will mean the opposite, because you are on different karmic paths.

</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics could really help with that, guiding your towards a deeper self-acceptance and forgiveness. Especially MDMA therapy.
</p>

<p>
	It's a shame to see you suffering for years with that stuff unnecessarily when the tools for healing exist. You can heal yourself in a few years of work and live a happy life.

	It's not the drug, it's how you use it. I feel like many people trip but don't seriously contemplate because they are not contemplative people by nature.

<p>
	I don't know. I lack expertise in such things. My primary focus is not on superpowers but understanding consciousness. Any superpowers I discover will be side-effects of my search for understanding.

<p>
	You are talking about cultivating classic yogic siddhis. If you're serious about that, you probably want some serious yogic practice. But also be careful chasing such things. I would focus on awakening and liberation.

	Again, I don't do psychedelics for pleasure. Yeah, if pleasure was the reason I was doing it, I'd be doing 5-MeO-DMT every day of the year. But that would be a harmful addiction.
</p>

<p>
	You shouldn't use psychedelics for being in a pleasant mood or state. That option has never even cross my mind until you just brought it up to me now. I went for 3 years without seriously considering doing that because it would be such a foolish move.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful getting hooked on positive moods and feelings.

<p>
	Sorry, I don't recall where I read it. Probably some book on my book list. It's one of those anecdotes you read in passing without giving it much credence until years later.

<p>
	While I love the idea of being the first and greatest, I have read reports of a Western guy who attained mahasamadhi from LSD. He was actually meditating in a cave, did a bunch of LSD, and simply left his body for good.
</p>

<p>
	A guru in India later verified that the dude left his body and didn't simply die by suicide or overdose.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe the stories that is.
</p>

<p>
	Some interesting food for thought.
</p>

<p>
	I am certainly nowhere near that level of consciousness without 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	I also wouldn't call what I experienced as a rainbow body. I would call it becoming an infinite singularity of love forever. It is totally formless consciousness. Like becoming pure potential with no actualization.
</p>

			Leo, have you watched Steven Greer’s new Movie Close Encounters of the fifth Kind? That movie is all about consciousness and how we can communicate with E.T beings through it. As you are someone with a high baseline level of consciousness I’d love to see you give the protocols a try, maybe even go on A expedition with Greer? Radical open mindedness and all that. What do you say?

<p>
	I've watched some of his older stuff. Not sure about the newest one. Not sure what to make of it, honestly. On the one hand it seems convincing, on the other hand it's also very conspiratorial and us vs them.
</p>

<p>
	As soon as I see people framing reality or society as us vs them, I get turned off because I know it isn't the highest truth. It's the ego projecting its fears and blaming some "elites" which I don't buy.

</blockquote>

<p>
	If you were conscious enough to be telepathic you wouldn't care about downloading PhD programs and you'd probably realize your brain is imaginary too.
</p>

<p>
	What people misunderstand about these supernatural abilities is that they cannot be co-opted and made to serve the ego's petty selfish desires. These powers arise out of a deep selfless consciousness which isn't so much concerned with how to manifest money or prove itself to closedminded materialist scientists, etc. It's got bigger fish to fry.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I don't have telepathic abilities in my normal state. It was a function of lots of 5-MeO-DMT. I have not cultivated it as an ability. It was just a preview of what is possible with training.
</p>

	Ralston is saying there's no difference or it doesn't matter. And in a sense he is right. Wherever you go, there you are. God is in all places at once. I agree with that.

	There is no this or that with 5-MeO-DMT. There is only oneness.
</p>

<p>
	No, with mahasamadhi they are not merely saying a person dies, they are saying that consciousness has become so unbiased and infinite that it surrenders the formed material dream. This is not the same as ordinary death and it can be done on command, at will. How can you know? By doing it! Lol. Many examples are documented.

<p>
	We were talking about the relative domain of animals and human separation. Now you switch to Absolute as your trump card.
</p>

<p>
	The point was that animals and humans are not so different. Being an animal is not easy like how you made it sound. You are welcome to act like an animal at any time and see how easy or hard that life is. You don't act like an animal precisely because it's easier to be civilized.

<p>
	Nature isn't at rest. Nature is constantly in a brutal fight for survival. You think being a human is a curse? How about being a gazelle chased by lions your whole life? You can't call the police on a lion.
</p>

<p>
	Humans came from animals. There is a direct line from an oak to your ego. It's all just different layers of survival. More and more sophisticated survival.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason nature looks at rest is because you ain't knee deep in it, running away from a lion.

<p>
	There is a deeper level than this because your Absolute is now separate from the relative, from the form, from the change. But the Absolute is not merely formless, it is also identical to form, relativity, and change.
</p>

<p>
	Form IS myself. It makes no sense to differential form from formless. I am ONE, not two. Everything that changes is me.

			God can understand he is God, <em>precisely</em> because he can also NOT understand that, as you say. But it is infinity/god/nothing at all times, God loves himself infinitely whether you experience that or not.

			I would be cautious with Ralston's claim and clarify what "knowing" you're everything all the time means. As he sais chapter 9 of genius of being you can't survive within "no context". So he goes on to say that you can create a new context for experience that is inclusive of the understanding retained from the awakening. Sounds like what embodiment is about to me, and not "direct experience all the time".

			It just sounds like you say the Absolute is a state, which it isn’t. It is present in all states. It is the container of all states. It is the unchanging and unrelative.

<p>
	Again, language starts to break down at this level. You could call it a state or all possible states. Depends on how you define state and other terms in your worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the Absolute is all there is, but most people aren't conscious of the fact that their experience is Absolute. To be conscious that your experience is the Absolute you must be in the proper state which allows you to recognize it as such. If you're not in this case, the Absolute is still here, but you don't know it as such, and therefore you ain't awake.
</p>

<p>
	It's not quite right to say that the Absolute is unchanging because it's also changing all the time. If the Absolute is unchanging, then what is changing? Something other than the Absolute? That is absurd. So Absolute can't be separate from change.

			Do you mean the insight that you are to powerful and alone, everything is you, thats the reason why you created the ego, because of purpose of duality is satisfaction and love. God loves to see its duality to satisfy itself that it is not alone.  Love is the bridge between duality to non duality. Thats why all is one, because both sides complete each other. If god side never realize duality, It will never be understand that it is god. Thats why we created ourselves as a human now. God must create something separate from it in order to be a god, because in non duality everything is god. Such as , if cold is not exist warm can never be exist, if evil not exist goodnesses can never be exist. Thats the reason why many people must not know about they are God, because if everyone knows this knowledge it can never be duality. Because of that evil must be exist in entire civilization? Lol these were all the insights i got as a god on shrooms.

<p>
	It took me many trips to get those insights. I got no insights in my first trip.

	This has been well reported over the last few years. It's also obvious from the fact that he cannot even sit through a 5 page briefing. Not only does he not read books, he doesn't even read his presidential daily briefing reports. His advisors are told to dumb everything down with big pictures because he doesn't read words! He refuses to read past the first page or two of anything.

	Careful with the judging.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are simple folk and they need someone near their level. Hard to blame them for that, or even JP for appealing to them. They're at where they're at. Would you rebuke a 2nd grader for being in 2nd grade? Or the teacher teaching 2nd grade? Someone's gotta do it.

<p>
	But be careful that in making your million you don't sell your soul to the devil.
</p>

<p>
	It's relatively easy to make a million.
</p>

<p>
	It's much harder to do it without resorting to devilry.

<p>
	This will vary a lot from person to person.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all practice helps. So it's a good idea to try it and maybe do some visualization exercises to program that into your mind.
</p>

<p>
	But ultimately the trip itself will do most of the work. Literally all you gotta do is trust it and let go and let it show you God. That's it! It will show you exactly what you need next to reach towards God. Sometime that will be God itself. But often times it will first show you psychological baggage which is holding you back from facing God directly.

	Actually I would caution against this for you. Shamans are known to give huge doses, they make you vape it, and the toad venom isn't gonna have a consistent potency because no two toads are the same.

	The safest way to take 5-MeO-DMT is synthetic, and plugged up your butt.

	Again, I'm no doctor so I can't tell you what is safe for you.

<p>
	Like I said, the biggest factor is not the chemical itself but how you choose to react to it, which no one can predict. If you start freaking out, that can certainly cause some physical stress. But in my experience most psychedelics do not have a significant effect on the heart or blood. I don't feel my body getting taxed by them. The mind yes, the body not so much. But maybe that's just me. I tend to surrender to psychedelics very easily. So I rarely have issues.

I will check out 5 meo dmt again. I take blood thinner medication (warfarin, if warfarin level goes high i can have internal bleeding or low can have stroke, because i have a mechanical valve). I used shrooms because they are natural (Normal mushrooms, just includes psilocybin) . Additionally, i spoke with a clinic, which is located at Vancouver/Canada, they told me 5 meo dmt could be dangerous for me and advice either lsd or shrooms. Thats the reason why i have done the shrooms as 10 gr. Thanks a lot for the advice.  But I really want to do 5 meo dmt. I will deeply search it again.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, be cautious. I am not responsible for your health or death.
</p>

<p>
	But the nice thing with 5-MeO-DMT is that you can plug a tiny amount of it and just feel minor effects and slowly ramp up from there. So you should be able to gently inch your way up very carefully and feel if there is any blood pressure problems or heart problems. You can even measure your blood pressure while you're on it.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT makes my body feel good. It actually temporarily frees me of all my health problems. You just have to learn to surrender to it and then it feels amazing. The come-up only lasts from 5 mins to 15 mins. After the 15 min mark you will be tripping hard but the bodily stuff is behind you. Of course this assumes you surrender to it. If you resist it, oh boy... that might be hell. I'm too scared to dare resisting 5-MeO-DMT. Once that thing is in you, you better surrender immediately.
</p>

<p>
	I can foresee some serious heart issues if your dose goes 30mg+. That's when your consciousness will become so infinite that your heart will melt and explode out your chess in Love. There will be kundalini activation and all sorts of crazy shit can happen. But I never go that far. I keep my dose to 25mg max. Which is still crazy strong for me.

	It's pretty simple really: we can all agree there is only ONE being in the universe: God. This being can know it is God, or not know it. If it knows it, it's awake at least to some degree. If it doesn't know it, then it's clearly not in parinibbana. So clearly parinibbana cannot be a final resting.

			I think the entire point that Ralston's making is simply: do not confuse <em>this</em> state or <em>that</em> state with the "fact" that reality <em>is</em> states. One particular state is not enlightenment. Enlightenment is realizing reality is states, or you could say getting stuck in relativity vs realizing the absoluteness of relativity. I'm sure you're already aware of this, and also my formulation makes it look binary and simple. But it's to underline what I think the disagreement is

<p>
	Except my claim is that awakening IS a state. Some states of consciousness are awake and other aren't.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I disagree. Satori is a state and you can only achieve it precisely because you lost it to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	If satori was truly permanent, you could not have been born as a human ego. The whole point is that God can lose consciousness of itself. In fact, that's mostly what it's busy doing.
</p>

<p>
	You can argue that you never lost it, that you've always been awake. But to me this is silly. You were not born God-realized. Of course you were not born at all, but nevertheless, you believed for most of your life that you were born. Thus you were asleep. If you were asleep, then you weren't awake. And if you weren't awake, then whatever "permanent" satori you get in this life, you will lose at some point.
</p>

<p>
	God forgets itself, God remembers itself. This cycle has no beginning or end.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason there are unenlightened beings is because some enlightened being lost his permanent state of enlightenment.

You might have made incorrect conclusions about what is achievable without psychedelics, from your lack of achievements without them.

<p>
	Yes, I don't dispute this at all. By all means pursue a stable 24/7 satori. I am.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said in my Outrageous video, it's not about me being more woke than others. It's about reaching the highest understanding of reality. If you don't question the wokeness levels of your teachers you will simply never reach the highest levels of understanding possible. You will settle for less.
</p>

<p>
	My concern is understanding/consciousness, not comparing myself to other teachers. The comparison is only there in order to show you that there is a deeper level possible, not to put myself above others. Ralston is very masterful, much more so than I. So I don't hold him as some inferior person. I respect him a lot and value his work. But what he says about 5-MeO-DMT is simply incorrect. And you can easily verify it for yourself. 5-MeO-DMT will give you a deeper awakening than you will ever get at one of his workshops or enlightenment intensives. This much I would bet $100,000 on. With that said, I still enjoy his workshops. He has a lot to offer. But you won't understand most of it until you do 5-MeO-DMT.

I actually had a number of doctors with me in residency training who we're working in Burger king and delivering pizza while going through pre-med and medical school. One of those doctors who was in training with me, used to work in fast food chains cleaning tables, she's now a successful family doctor in her early 30s, happily owns her dream house in the countryside, has wisely paid off a significant amount of her student loans and is on the track to become a millionaire! I've personally met many doctors who used to work minimum wage jobs to get themselves through college. Another doctor I met was a Biology teacher getting paid slave wage as a schoolteacher, who decided to go through medical school in his late 40s and become a doctor. He's now making 10x what he made as a teacher and added another 0 to his annual income.
		</p>

		<p>
			All these doctors from various backgrounds proved to me that one can become a doctor regardless of what minimum wage job they're currently working.
		</p>

		<p>
			P.S. I love you soo much

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Fair enough. I guess if you really want it you can do it.
</p>

<p>
	But it strikes me as odd that someone would become a doctor in order to become wealthy. There are easier ways. Being a doctor should be a career of passion, something you're really drawn towards naturally, otherwise I don't know how you'll keep that up. Business is more flexible. You can start many kinds of different businesses. Being a doctor is a very specific career for a very specific kind of person.
</p>

<p>
	But of course it's possible to become a millionaire simply by getting a six-figure high-skill career. I guess I'm biased towards business because then your earning potential is unlimited. It's hard to earn $10 mil as even a great doctor. But it's relatively easy in business.

<p>
	That may be wise. I'm no doctor.
</p>

<p>
	But also, once you get used to 5-MeO-DMT, it doesn't really put pressure on the heart. The heart pressure and blood pressure will naturally rise if you are freaked out over ego-death. But if you surrender calmly, nothing should rise. The 5-MeO-DMT is challenging mentally, not so much physically. At least when plugged.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, in your case it might be too dangerous. Then again, you say you did 10g shrooms so...
</p>

<p>
	I would be more scared of 10g shrooms than 5-MeO-DMT. I find shrooms to be one of the most challenging substances aside from salvia.
</p>

<p>
	I definitely caution you guys to be careful with 5-MeO-DMT. I am very careful with it, and even so, I've had some challenging times. Exploring consciousness can be dangerous activity. Then again, Peter Ralston has jumped off roof-tops in his youth and fought in deadly tournaments -- so he's not exactly above dangerous things. I think martial arts is more dangerous than moderately dosed psychedelics.

</p>

<p>
	Doctors and lawyers make that much because they invested 8 years in expensive schools and have a ton of student debt to pay off for a decade.
</p>

<p>
	The statistics on anyone becoming a millionaire are gonna be low, by definition, because millionaires must be rare in society. When you say you want to become a millionaire you are automatically shooting for the top 2-3% of society. Yeah, that's gonna have a high failure rate because you gotta out-compete the other 98%.
</p>

<p>
	But it's not a matter of luck, it's a matter of working smart and really really wanting it. If you really really want it, you can do it. The problem is most people don't want it bad enough. They aren't willing to work for it. The failure rate is so high because most people who attempt it are just bullshitters. They aren't serious.

	You imagine every Zen master who ever lived. That's actual. When you realize that, talking to them will become moot. You'd just be talking to yourself.

<p>
	Shrooms are a very twisted experience. 5-MeO-DMT is much clearer and more of a pure satori. Shrooms don't give a pure satori. They mix it with a lot of mind stuff, shadow stuff, fantasy, imagination, etc. At 10 grams, mushrooms are basically madness. So that's not a good reference point for judging something like 5-MeO-DMT or other psychedelics. Mushrooms are the most twisted short of salvia.

<p>
	Lol, that's precisely what I mean. You were able to give it up precisely because you burned through that karma. You satiated that desire to the point where now you can transcend it. This is what I said above is the most realistic way.
</p>

<p>
	Now imagine what would have happened had you spent decades suppressing it and trying to act saintly.

<p>
	Growing up requires living through experiences. It's not enough to just theoretically let stuff go. Experience, struggle, and failure are necessary to learn the deepest lessons. Which is why we have life in the first place.

<p>
	If you take enough 5-MeO-DMT you will get infinite satori. Satori with no bottom. Deeper than every Zen master who has ever lived combined.
</p>

<p>
	Satori just means God-realization. But there are many degrees of God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	You can read Zen books like Three Pillars of Zen to get a sense of how words like satori or kensho are used by Zen masters. You will also find that Zen masters have various levels of satori. For example, I don't doubt that Shinzen Young has some degree of satori, but he don't understand Infinity/God to my satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to get a mild satori. It's much harder to gain complete God-realization and the omniscience that comes with it.

<p>
	There is no escaping states of consciousness. Consciousness is always in some state, whether you are enlightened or not, or even if you are dead.
</p>

<p>
	So saying something is "a state" is silly, because EVERYTHING is a state. Calling a thing a state doesn't say anything.
</p>

<p>
	Satori is a state. Which is why psychedelics can induce satori. How long it lasts is irrelevant. Anyone can easily test that psychedelics induce satori and awakening. This is foolish to argue about. Test it. All my claims are empirical and verifiable.
</p>

<p>
	But it is also good that you guys are confused and don't know who to believe. That forces you to test both Peter and me and do the work to verify what is true. Now you are forced to really investigate this matter and think deeply about it. Perhaps both of us are wrong and you will find even some higher truth.
</p>

<p>
	Disagreement between advanced teachers is one of the best things for a student. It forces you to ask how such a thing is possible. If enlightenment was so simple, how come there is so much disagreement??? Hmmmm...... could that be a clue?
</p>

<p>
	The question is, to what degree?
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT can give you a such a satori that you will not even be able to walk around.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is stable and functional doesn't make it the highest.

<p>
	Most people are not simply gonna be able to drop sex, no matter your logic or numbers. The better strategy is to satiate the sex drive rather than repress it. If you can genuinely drop it, great. But that's so rare it makes you a unique person.
</p>

<p>
	This is a topic where it helps to be realistic rather than saintly. That saintliness will come back to bite you if you aren't fully able to embody it naturally. Saintliness through repression will not work.

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is not a subjective state. 5-MeO-DMT goes beyond traditional enlightenment to levels of awakening that no ordinary human is capable of. Awakening has many degrees and omniscience is possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Peter and I have some important disagreements.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that the people who do Peter's workshops and retreats... I would not consider a single one of them truly awake. Neither is his apprentice -- who I'm good friends with. It's all good stuff, but it's not even 1% close to the awakenings I've experienced.

<p>
	The problem is that you have to draw the line somewhere for pragmatic reasons. If you spend your time chasing down ever rumor found on the internets, you'll be doing that for 1,000 years and never awaken.
</p>

<p>
	So you must balance between openmindedness but also practicality. You have limited time and energy and focus. You must be highly strategic. Distraction is a tactic of devilry. The devil would love nothing more than to have you chasing down every conspiracy theory.
</p>

<p>
	Have you noticed that the most awake people do not talk about conspiracy theories? Why do you think that is?
</p>

<p>
	Don't discuss low level bullshit in a Zen temple.
</p>

<p>
	We are not going to wasting our time here talking about 9/11 inside job bullshit. And if 9/11 really was an inside job? Oh well, we got bigger fish to fry. My job here is to keep you guys on track rather than devolving into the Alex Jones show. If you really want to explore conspiracy theories, go ahead, just do it elsewhere. I feel no obligation to provide you a platform for that.

<p>
	You are right, there are higher level of mind at which the mind can still think/reason about reality and understand it at much deeper levels than any human can.
</p>

<p>
	That's precisely what psychedelics offer. They give you super-mind. You can reason and think in ways far beyond the conventional human mind. It's like having the mind of a super-intelligence alien.
</p>

<p>
	But there is something even beyond super-mind, which is Infinite Consciousness or Omniscience or Being.

<p>
	Cause & effect is dualistic. It is an illusion and the casual chains are infinitely long, with not beginning or end. And they run in circles and strange loops.

He's toyed around with stuff. He has not yet started on the path towards awakening. It's just not something he's interested in. So of course it's no surprise he's not awake. He's a fucking comedian. Let's be real here. We should not hold Joe up to the same standard as a Buddha.

<p>
	Well, first of all, it is not I who deny this, it is science. Quantum mechanics throws the classic notion of a deterministic physical universe under the bus.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, the term determinism comes with a lot of bad materialistic metaphysical baggage which is better thrown in the trash. Calling reality deterministic is just not right. It doesn't fit that category well. I would just drop it in favor of better descriptions.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than calling it deterministic, call it Infinite Consciousness. That's much more accurate. This gives an air of mystery to it, which is precisely correct. Now you must experience what Infinite Consciousness is by some awakening experiences.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You are still trying to drag God down into the mud, to your relative level, but God cannot be understood that way. You must empty your cup and rise to God's level. This means surrendering the relative -- at least for a while.
</p>

<p>
	The question of whether other minds exists cannot be properly answered at the relative level. At the absolute level you will realize that other minds are your mind.
</p>

<p>
	To realize what another is requires a specific awakening experience.

		</p>

		<p>
			You recently started rejecting determinism. For me as I have walked this path the deterministic cause and effect chain has become more and more apparent. Nothing happens at random. Synchronicity = determinism. And this body of course is not separate from the whole, thus has no free will. The ocean is moving all the ‘parts’ in unerring perfection.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now, as God, of course that is different. As God/Consciousness you are free. And whatever is happening is Gods choosing. Remove all of the body/minds illusion of control and Gods will flows through you unimpeded.
		</p>

		<p>
			So how can you reject determinism?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	God is a tautology, so it cannot be anything other than what it is. And God is all there is. BUT! God's Will generates everything, so calling this determinism is incorrect. Determinism is a materialistic notion which does not even come close to understanding how and why reality unfolds as it does. Reality is an act of Will. God's Will for Love. The ego's will for survival. Etc. The ego's will is a splinter off God's Will. If the ego fully surrenders, then it moves in line with God's Will.
</p>

<p>
	God is a tautology not by accident, but because God wills itself to be Love. God IS Love and it cannot be anything else because an Infinite Intellect will always choose Perfection over anything else. There cannot be anything else! Non-perfection doesn't exist!
</p>

<p>
	The duality between determinism and free will must of course collapse.

<p>
	Depends on how deeply you want to understand. All explanations are partial and limited. To really understand you have to recognize the magic of Infinity. This is beyond conventional explanation. Of course you can still use conventional explanations like science, but they will always be incomplete and partial.

<p>
	Synchronicity is not confirmation bias or some such thing.
</p>

<p>
	With a true synchronicity your mind recognizes the Intelligence of the Design. This is not a psychological phenomenon but a spiritual one. It's like noticing God winking at you everywhere you look.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Infinite Consciousness
</p>

<p>
	What you see is exactly HOW it is happening. Reality is 100% direct. You cannot understand it as a process or a causal chain because it is 100% direct. Being IS the process. Since God is unlimited and creation costs God nothing, God can do without any process.
</p>

<p>
	Think about it, why would an unlimited power need a process? It can just directly manifest precisely whatever it wanted to. A process would imply that God has to follow some rules or limits, but God invented all the rules and limits, so it is not bound by them.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you see is the process unfolding. Nothing is hidden. Nothing is happening behind the scenes. This. Is. It.
</p>

<p>
	I was not talking about struggle with sex. I was talking about who has a higher desire to have sex on the drop of a dime. And that's men.
</p>

<p>
	It's not in a woman's survival interest to be constantly horny on the drop of dime. She doesn't have that luxury. Her horniness is selective whereas a man's is not.

<p>
	God/Love/Truth/Reality is the one doing the imagining. It comes prior to thought experiments and even openmindedness -- which still a feature of the mind. God transcends the human mind.
</p>

<p>
	Openmindedness is like the key that unlocks the door to the Absolute. But once the door is unlocked, walk through it. Don't stand around looking at the keys.

<p>
	They have their pros and cons.

<p>
	The problem with talking about strength is that it very much depends not just on the drug but on your point in the spiritual journey.

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is best for its clarity and absoluteness. Other substances have other advantages.
