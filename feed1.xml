The conservative value set is lower consciousness. A conservative's sense of self is denser and fear greater. A conservative's cognitive and moral development are objectively lower and less truthful.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with false equivalencies and splitting all issues down the middle.
</p>

<p>
	The mid point between slavery and anti-slavery is still backwards.
</p>

<p>
	None of this makes liberals immune to ignorance or self-deception. But relative to conservatives they are 1 stage higher.
</p>

<p>
	Note: remember, these are relative evaluations, not absolute. Spiral Dynamics is a relative model. But politics is a relative matter so it fits.

<p>
	I notice you guys still have not penetrated (excuse the pun) the issue of survival as talked about in my 2 part survival series.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like using sex for pleasure is still survival! Survival is not just about making babies. Survival is about maintaining your self. The desire for intimacy, romance, and companionship is all survival.
</p>

<p>
	If a thing in life has any importance to you, you can be sure it's tied to your survival in some elaborate way.
</p>

<p>
	If a thing was irrelevant to your survival, you would not be talking about it, much less having a strong opinion about it.
</p>

<p>
	Opinions and emotions are survival.
</p>

<p>
	Realize this: one vs many it itself a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is one. Reality is many. It's both. There is no difference between the two. And there is a difference between the two. Depending on your POV.
</p>

<p>
	Is a dozen eggs one, or many?
</p>

<p>
	Notice the role of relativity in these kinds of questions.

<p>
	You are not conscious of what a distinction is. You merely have some intellectual idea about it, which always happens to be way off the mark.

<p>
	I am not stating my views. I am explaining how the culture holds sexuality.
</p>

<p>
	Of course my explanation is stage Blue/Orange because that's what our culture mostly is.
</p>

<p>
	If you wish to transcend this Blue/Orange stage we first need to be honest about it and understand it. Many people want to jump to stage Green love without fully understanding that sex & "love" are survival strategies. And then of course these same Green people end up having terrible relationships and much sex which ends in misery. That's because they fooled themselves into calling their selfish survival strategies "love".
</p>

<p>
	"love" is very tricky. The devil co-opts love so easily.

<p>
	It's not a matter of degrading or not. This is just how the sexual marketplace works for most humans. This is culture and survival.
</p>

<p>
	It does not have to be this way in the future. But today this is the cultural reality.
</p>

<p>
	When we talk about culture we are talking about averages and trends, so individual exceptions are expected. Just because you might not care about the cultural norms and values does not mean they don't exist.
</p>

<p>
	Most women want to settle down with a man who will be loyal to her. To deny this is silly. This desire to settle down with a man is a survival strategy.

<p>
	Psychedelics should definitely not be done competitively. That runs counter to the whole spirit of spirituality.

<p>
	The shadow is simply all those aspects of the universe (self) which you have denied in order to maintain a limited human ego self. Yes, to fully embrace yourself as the whole universe you must now re-own those denied aspects of yourself. So that you may finally be complete. You must unify all the divisions your mind has created since your birth. For most people this is a difficult process because there is so much of the universe they have hated and demonized for so long. Now it must be admitted that all that hatred and demonetization was self-hatred and falsehood.

	See video: Understanding Absolute Infinity - Part 2 wherein is discussed Georg Cantor's set theory, which explains how multiple infinities work.
</p>

<p>
	There is an infinite number of different sizes of infinity. Which all adds up to one Absolute Infinity.

</p>

<p>
	I'm glad he's exploring Wilber's work, but Michael Brooks still doesn't understand the significance of Wilber's work and what Spiral Dynamics / developmental psychology means for politics.
</p>

<p>
	Michael is in high stage Green, but he's a bit too attached to Marxism, socialism, and the progressive movement to move into Tier 2. He's still operating at Tier 1 thinking. It's fine, but there's a higher level.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Michael makes valid critiques of the IDW and conservatives. But there are also important critiques of Marxism which he is missing. For example, one of the biggest critiques of Marx is his materialism. Materialism is false. Marx actually bastardized Hegel. Marx took Hegel's masterpiece philosophy -- which was idealist and quasi-nondual -- and lowered it by turning it materialistic and atheistic.
</p>

<p>
	A political philosophy based on materialism and atheism cannot possibly work in the long term. It will be fundamentally limited by misunderstanding the true metaphysics of reality.
</p>

<p>
	The whole trick with going to the highest levels of politics is being extremely careful not to get hung up on any pet ideology, whether Marxist, capitalist, or whatever. All ideology is limited and partial. Tier 2 politics is going beyond ideology.
</p>

<p>
	For Michael to move into Tier 2, he'd have to go through a painful process of dropping stage Green. This won't serve his immediate survival agenda as a political analyst.
</p>

<p>
	He's still a bit too intellectually arrogant to move into Tier 2. He'll need some mystical experiences to open him up and humble him.
</p>

			Can you explain this point?  Do you mean sex workers, rather than sluts. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	What's to explain?
</p>

<p>
	Everyone knows that women who have lots of casual sex are shamed and looked down upon as sluts.
</p>

<p>
	Why does this happen?
</p>

<p>
	Because the woman's value within society is directly related to her locking down a loyal man. If a woman is unable to do this, society thinks there's something wrong with her, like she's broken.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all of this is silly in the absolute sense. But in the relative world of survival it's a big deal. A woman cannot be seen as a slut because then no man will want to lock her down. Which hurts her survival ability. A woman's survival is significantly increased by locking down a responsible man.
</p>

<p>
	A woman who sleeps around a lot cannot be trusted by her man because he can't be sure if their kid is actually his. Women need to reassure men that their children are the man's children and no one else's. This is why men tend to be controlling of women. The man needs to be sure his wife isn't sleeping around behind his back because it can cost him enormously if she does so. In the past, such transgressions were punishable by death in many parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
	When a child is born, women go out of their way to say, "Oh look, he looks just like Daddy!" as as a subtle way of reassuring her man that "Look, this is really your kid, not someone else's."
</p>

<p>
	Sex and relationships are all a sneaky game of survival and manipulation. Automatically so. You're not at all conscious of how or why you're doing it. Rather, it's doing you. You are a marionette to sex.
</p>

	Don't be so negative.
</p>

<p>
	Society is the most evolved right now than it's ever been in the last 5000 years. The 21st century is a great time to be alive.
</p>

<p>
	Stop worrying, awakening yourself, and go about joyfully awakening society even further.

<p>
	The world needs your love, hope, vision, and passion.

	I've found psychedelics to be the best way. What he's bumping up against in his trips is the root of all fear. With dozens more trips the psychedelics should help him see through the illusory nature of all fear and break through to the other side of fear, which is Infinite Self-Love and Self-Acceptance -- Paradise!

<p>
	Great work. That's some quality tripping.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually, as you trip more, you should conquer that sense of going mad and after that it won't be a big deal. You will be able to go even deeper into the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	You are not pure enough yet and your self-understanding is not deep enough yet. You have too much fear which needs to be faced, processed, and put to rest.
</p>

<p>
	Facing madness and facing death are two of the biggest obstacles. But once you conquer those, that's when the tripping gets really profound and life-changing. You need to get as much of your personal crap out of the way as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's imagination happening, creating a relative sense of space.
</p>

<p>
	You are using the mind to compare thing A to thing B and then taking that difference as space. But where is that "space" located? Nowhere. Nowhere is infinite, so it is everywhere, giving the illusion of space. But there is no elsewhere but HERE and NOW. All places are NOW yet nowhere, thus allowing an infinite number of hidden dimensions to reality. Since everywhere is nowhere, all beings can be tucked away inside it, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
	There can literally be an infinite number of universes taking place right on top of each other, so to speak. Since they are all nowhere. That's the beauty of nowhere: it is unlimited.

<p>
	The point is, all value is relative and imaginary. At this point a large part of her value, culturally, is reproductive. Don't forget, no babies, no human species. That's not changing anytime soon.
</p>

<p>
	All this discussion was simply to explain why sex is so moralized. Doesn't have to be in the future. But women still lose a lot of cultural value for being sluts. Relative value.

<p>
	To make a long story short: consciousness & love is the answer to all moral questions.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot fake consciousness or love. You act from your current level of consciousness, whatever that is. No amount of moralizing, theory, ideals, or ideology will change that. If you want to act better, raise your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The less self you have, the more loving you will be. If you want to be more moral, deconstruct your self until nothing of you remains.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot have a self and be moral at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is located in one place: literally nowhere.
</p>

<p>
	Space and time are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Right now you are nowhere. You've been in this nowhere for your whole life. You will be in this nowhere FOREVER! You cannot escape nowhere because there is nowhere else to go but nowhere, and you're already there. You've been nowhere FOREVER.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is becoming conscious of this fact.
</p>

<p>
	Practically, that is how human sexuality works. Since sexuality is a survival function its value is of course purely relative and imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Why is sex valuable to males and females? Ultimately for no reason whatsoever other than to advance the self. You don't go sticking your dick into tree holes because it does not advance your self. If it did, you'd do it and pay money for it. And tree holes would suddenly be worth a lot of money. There would be armed guards around every tree hole to ensure money is collected and the holes are not damaged (so more money could be collected in the future).
</p>

<p>
	Just observe how sex works. You'll see it's transactional. Sex is a transaction between two beings who have certain needs which they want met.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	By raising your consciousness high enough to realize that survival is an illusion and unimportant in the absolute sense. Survival is a relative matter. True morality is the transcendence of the need to survive. When you no longer care about whether you survive or not, then you have become truly moral. Otherwise you are a devil.

	That is of course a very good point.

<p>
	All progress is relative to one's past position.

<p>
	But still, China's authoritarian features are hard to ignore. They have some serious structural problems. Chinese people cannot even vote! That is not sustainable and that is not conscious.

		</p>

		<p>
			How did you build such a transversal mastery on that specific topic btw? I don't recall seeing much political content on your booklist? Who and what ressources influenced your analysis ? Are you pulling just most of them from your own personal insights or are you also standing here a bit on the shoulder of giants? Perhaps Ken Wilber has given you some nice tools?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is thanks to the power of holistic big picture thinking. It's precisely because I don't over-specialize in any one field that I am able to see a much bigger picture than most experts and professors. Specialization comes at the cost of wisdom and vision. I sacrifice technical accuracy for big picture understanding. Experts and professionals do the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	Politics cannot really be understood properly without a deep understanding of epistemology, ideology, cults, metaphysics, nondualty, spirituality, consciousness, philosophy, sociology, psychology, science, religion, language, ego, devilry, Spiral Dynamics, developmental psychology, relativism, and history.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than reading a lot of political theory, I spend a lot of time studying human beings, especially their collective behaviors. If you do that long enough without being ideological yourself, you will start to see how the whole game works. It's all about the mind clinging to various positions and refusing to acknowledge the bias and partiality of its own perspective. Without a deep understanding of epistemology there cannot be a deep understanding of politics.

</blockquote>

<p>
	By that logic, why should you raise a family? Why should you start a work project? Why should you start a video game? Why should you drive to the grocery store? Why should you start having sex?
</p>

<p>
	Just as you're about to pull your dick out to have sex an airplane might crash through your roof and kill you.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe you should just curl up into a little ball in the corner of your room and wait for death to take you?
</p>

<p>
	There is never any guarantee that hard work will payoff before you die.
</p>

<p>
	If you're asking, "But what's in it for me?!!!" you've already fallen into the greatest trap: selfishness.

<p>
	Yes, that is the nature of survival. Your survival must happen at the cost of others survival.
</p>

<p>
	But there is a question of degree of selfishness.

<p>
	That's the trick with life, you cannot create a mechanical formula for what to do. You must use consciousness and wisdom to solve the puzzles.
</p>

<p>
	It would be foolish to try to eradicate all of anything. Life is far more subtle than that.
</p>

<p>
	Killing lots of stuff is usually not a very conscious solution.

</p>

<p>
	That is correct. Absolute Infinity cannot lack anything because it is total.
</p>

<p>
	Totality can only be singular. You can't have two totalities otherwise they weren't totalities to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could say that God is the totality of all sub-totalities.

	She is certainly ridiculed and dismissed for the most part.
</p>

<p>
	She will not resonate with stage Blue or Orange people.
</p>

<p>
	But also to be fair, I think she's not really cut out for being President. Presidency requires political experience. A person with zero government experience is going to be naive and make obvious mistakes no matter how well developed they are. Development and consciousness alone are not enough to make a great political leader.

<title>What's the deal with the moralization of sexuality?</title>

<p>
	Morality is a major survival function.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is a major survival function
</p>

<p>
	The two go hand in hand because sex is a very powerful force for humans. It dominates all of human life. This force is controlled and manipulated by the individual ego and the collective ego in order to maximize survival. Church and state both have a vested interest in regulating sex.
</p>

<p>
	Sex seems like fun and games, but sex is also a matter of life and death, especially for the woman. So she and her family must take it very seriously because her value in society is directly tied to her reproductive potential.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is worth a lot of money so egos will come up with all sorts of ways to manipulate it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, you can build entire empires with sex. People did and still do.
</p>

<p>
	That's where spirituality intersects with life purpose. Your LP should be about helping mankind raise consciousness in whatever way you find more meaningful. That could be through film, social media, writing, music, art, business, politics, education, engineering, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing for now is to educate yourself further. A deep study should be made of Conscious Politics before you run off to start some political or social revolution.
</p>

<p>
	Once you do that AND you find your LP, then your whole life will be making an impact and helping to elevate people.

<p>
	Notice how Marianne Williamson is ridiculed as a hippie New Ager by the mainstream press and pundits.
</p>

<p>
	That's how people ahead of their time are treated by the mouth-breathing masses.
</p>

<p>
	She is certainly not electable today. And why is that? Because the level of consciousness of the majority of voters is too low to appreciate the level she is speaking from. So it will take a few hundred years of social evolution before her ideas become accepted as obvious and mainstream. In the meantime, over 10 million people will have to die for that lesson to be learned.
</p>

<p>
	And the biggest mindfuck of it all will be: once her ideas are accepted as totally obvious, no one in that future generation will believe that it could have been any other way. They will take it all for granted.

			Let me just say I thoroughly enjoyed it. I didn't really feel GOD-like or anything, maybe I am just not ready or conscious enough or something but I can see why people say that DPT has a more "darker" tone to it then other substances. Let me explain...

		<p>
			On the come up I was just laughing at everything. Then here's where the "darker" tone comes in. I remember at one point in the DPT trip it felt as if I was being possessed over and over again by different malevolent spirits telling me that I need to work on my sub communications towards people, because people can sense through my vocal tonality that there is no empathy there and that I need to have empathy in order for people to feel safe around me. I then just starting laughing like an evil maniac. I think for most normal people this type of thing would scare the shit out of them but honestly I was really enjoying getting possessed over and over again which I am not so sure if that's a good or bad thing lol. That was the the so called evil part of the trip

<p>
	I don't find that to be true.
</p>

<p>
	1) Research shows that conservatives are consistently more closedminded than liberals. Conservatives are generally not interested in exploring other POVs. Liberals are more open to that and more tolerant of other perspectives. Of course not always so. Many liberals also become dogmatic. And many liberals especially hate conservatives and therefore misunderstand them.
</p>

<p>
	2) Spiral Dynamics research shows that conservatives are lower in their cognitive and moral development than liberals.

<p>
	I agree that we need more mutual understanding of all perspectives. Which is why I spend a lot of time studying conservative perspectives. But conservatives almost never do that. When was the last time you saw a conservative reading a book on Marxism or Feminism? It's laughable. They would never do that.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that conservatives merely disagree with socialism or post-modernism, for example. They fundamentally do not know what socialism or post-modernism is. Even highly educated conservatives like Jordan Peterson, who is a professor, do not have enough intellectual curiosity and objectivity to understand socialism or post-modernism. Liberalism correlates positively with higher education. Which is why conservatives like to ridicule and demonize universities and academia.
</p>

<p>
	I agree that most leftists do not understand the right wing to their core. But the right wing understands leftism even worse. Just go watch Fox News to see the proof.

<p>
	That's rather a shame. There is a definite answer, if you'd only be curious enough to seek it.
</p>

<p>
	I'll tell you this: it's worth seeking.

<p>
	How is it that you exist but are not curious enough to know why you exist and what all this creation is for?

<p>
	The answer is not a blank.

</p>

<p>
	1) People interfere with tripping, even if it's just 1 or 2.
</p>

<p>
	2) The shaman's medicine doesn't have standardized potency and he has no idea how tolerant you are. He does not have the time to gradually test doses on you to find your sweet spot. But at home you can (and should) do just that.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not surprised at all that some people go to a shaman and freak out. Because you took way too big a dose too fast.
</p>

<p>
	Gradual dosing is KEY in this work. It's very easy to overwhelm yourself and scare yourself off from psychedelics forever. It's like raising a child. You don't expose a 5 year old child to the entire adult world in one shot. You have to gradually ease him into it, otherwise he will freak out and develop a pathology. You wouldn't show a 5 year old child hardcore rape porn or videos of terrorist beheadings. That would obviously traumatize him. This is what's happening to you when you dose too high.
</p>

<p>
	The mind of God can be a terrifying thing to those who are inexperienced with navigating it. Because it is so powerful. Remember, this mind is responsible for creating the entire universe. So yeah, expect it to be unbelievably, frighteningly powerful. It takes great maturity and purity of heart to explore all its nooks and crannies. It is like exploring the mind of a madman. You have to be slightly mad to want to do it.

	Enlightenment cannot be explained by materialism or science whatsoever. Not even close.

<p>
	Whatever that lady experienced, that was a drop in the bucket of Infinite Consciousness. Her explanations are but hallucinations within the mind of God. She is hallucinating neuroscience without realizing it. And everyone watching her is hallucinating her without realizing it. LOL

	Cermonial settings are less than ideal because dosage is unknown and the environment is chaotic.
</p>

<p>
	Trip at home on small doses and it will be good.
</p>

<p>
	Do 10-20 low dose trips to get yourself grounded and comfortable in the psychedelic space.

<p>
	It just won't make sense until you experience it for yourself.

<p>
	These advanced things cannot be formulated in words and they are beyond logic or scientific method. So without direct experience of it you're stuck.

	The US Airforce releases credible video footage of UFOs out running the world's best jet fighters and radar locks and you ignore it. So who's being stupid here?

Keep asking them of yourself as you contemplate, meditate, and trip.
</p>

<p>
	If your desire to understand consciousness is deep enough, eventually you should get the answers until everything becomes clear.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that you are imagining the entire physical world with all of its rules and limitations. So if some physical scenario (like your camera example) works the way it works, it works that way precisely because you imagine it that way. But you're not aware yet of how you're doing it. Notice that your confusion rises because you imagine that it (the camera) should work some other way. You imagine that way and then super-impose it upon your yet deeper layer of imagination of the physical world. So the confusion arises because you're imaging things at various layers and getting tangled up in them.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine there are other people and cameras who see things. Then you complain how come they don't see things as you see things. Because first and foremost you imagine they are separate from you. You gotta untangle the many layers of your own imaginings. Of course first and foremost you gotta realize that "you" and "imagination" are themselves entangled, confused, and imaginary notions.
</p>

It is not so simplistic as imagining a unicorn and it physically appears.
</p>

<p>
	Reality/consciousness has many partitions and levels which are hidden from itself. Just like a sophisticated operating system. The OS does not allow access to all of its parts willy nilly to any random app. There are permissons and layers of security to ensure the integrity of the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
	There are aspects to consciousness which are private and aspects which are public. This duality itself is imaginary though at higher levels of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of being an individual creature is that you have this private domain of consciousness to work within. You are master over your private little dimension. Or at least it appears that way to you because that's how you know you're an individual being. God had to imagine that for you. Now you want to blur those boundaries but you're still so busy being in a state of separation.
</p>

<p>
	What good would God's design be if I could imagine that your child is a dog and he suddenly turned into a dog? Can you see why such a design would be problematic? So as a human I am precisely not given such powers.
</p>

<p>
	All limitations and boundaries are purely imaginary, but as a human you are not given consciousness of how this imagination works -- for your own benefit. It's too much for most people to handle. Human life is on a need-to-know basis. God does not reveal things to you which you do not need to know. Unless you need to know them. Then all is revealed. Which is why a burning need to know is so important in this work.
</p>

<title>How can there be Self Deception with Ultimate Authority?</title>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can very easily be decieved by your own imagination by getting lost in it.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you can imagine a religion or a system of morals or a scientific model and then believe in it so strongly that you forget that you imagined it.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're a writer who writes a novel so deep and so fantastical that he starts to confuse it for reality. He starts to believe that his fictional characters and all their problems are real.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you are fully conscious there can be no self-deception. But the problem is few people are fully conscious because consciousness is so vast and deep.
</p>

<p>
	It's precisely because you are the ultimate authority that you can totally delude yourself. If you imagine with your full conviction that you are a Muslim or Jew or Christian, that will become your reality until death.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of consciousness is such that it can fully mesmerize you. Because it is singular and all-powerful.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so simple. There are many different facets to God's awareness. Sometimes you're aware of one facet but not another.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you have to sorta see different facets individually and then piece them together. There's just too damn much to see it all at once.

	I have thought about it long ago. It's great in theory. In practice, the issue is that it takes serious skill and understanding to properly structure such a Wiki without having it turn into devilry of all kinds. People will try to inject their person biases into the Wiki, devolving into a nonduality war over whose enlightenment is deepest and truest.

<p>
	No, it's because your mind is actively denying that such people are yourself.
</p>

<p>
	When you judge another human, you are separating them from yourself, which is fundamentally false.

	I also find it problematic that he does not explicitly talk about God either.
</p>

<p>
	He is God-realized but he keeps a lot of things unsaid.

<p>
	That is his style. He's very rigorous and detached. Very Zen-like, very masculine.
</p>

<p>
	It has its pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that he's not loving. He is a loving guy. But the problem is he doesn't explicitly teach it. The word love is not part of his vocabulary, which is a problem from my POV.

<p>
	He is an excellent teacher, but he is missing the most important and deepest aspect of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	I used to think I was crazy to think so, now I know 100% that he does not understand existential Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love and Truth are one. This realiziation is critical. It is the core of this work. Love is not merely a human emotion. Love is the entire reason for existence.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just Ralston, I notice now that many Eastern spiritual schools do not properly understand or teach Love. Zen and Buddhism are guilty of this. Even Vedanta to some extent doesn't teach Love properly.

			I think it comes down to the insane amount of focus psychedelics give you that starts ripping through the veil of materialism. Also "If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.".

			So seeing shit without psychedelics sounds pretty normal to me if you meditate.

<p>
	These are delicate molecules we're dealing with, so you definitely don't want to boil it or apply a flame to it.
</p>

<p>
	Just put a shot glass of water in the microwave for 20 seconds. It gets very hot. Then you can pour that onto your substance.
</p>

	Align yourself with love and you will align yourself with God. God only has one intention: Infinite Love.

<p>
	If you stare long enough at the carpet without blinking your eyes, you will see it start to melt and wave around.
</p>

<p>
	You can also notice neon tips.
</p>

<p>
	I mean sober. Usually sober people just overlook psychedelic effects in their visual field. It is filtered out as irrelevant to survival. But it's right there under the surface.
</p>

<p>
	If I sit down and meditate for 10 minutes my carpet starts to wave.
</p>
