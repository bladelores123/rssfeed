	VW CEO in prison now for his devilry.
</p>

<p>
	It takes an exceptional amount of corporate devilry for a CEO to end up in prison.

<p>
	Generally speaking, if mood goes up, it must come down. And since its all relative, you will perceive any drop in mood from its peak as a terrible thing.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind cannot evaluate absolute values of mood, only relative changes. So to jump from 50 to 100 and then back down to 50 is perceived the same as dropping from 50 to 0.

</p>

<p>
	Trump's wealth is a total con. But stage Orange doesn't care. To stage Orange, the appearance of wealth is as valid as actual wealth and it doesn't matter to stage Orange that his wealth was acquired through white collar crime and various kinds of exploitative schemes. Stage Orange just wants that golden toilet, damn the costs.
</p>

<p>
	To stage Orange, success = truth.

<p>
	That's totally predictable. Stage Orange is attracted to Trump's phony materialistic success, his phony business acumen, his phony masculinity, his vulgarity, and his giving an F.U. to stage Green.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarian types are attracted to that like flies to shit.
</p>

<p>
	I had a stage Orange coaching client about 3 years ago and he looked up to Trump as his role-model. When I asked him why, he said because Trump has a beautiful wife, the kind of trophy wife he'd like to have. This reveals the level of depth of stage Orange minds.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Orange does not understand the shallowness and self-defeating nature of materialism and capitalism. Stage Orange has made materialism its God. Sports cars, luxury condos, hot women, and millions of dollars are their vision of heaven.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I have, but all of that takes precious time and energy that I could put towards shooting more videos, creating more courses, and writing books.
</p>

<p>
	I might do some of those things in the future, but it's not a high priority.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with meeting people in person is that it's a lot of hassle and my reach becomes very small.

<p>
	Not quite. Enlightenment is the recontextualization of "experience" into Being/Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The raw data of perception doesn't change, it just gets recontextualized, reinterpreted.
</p>

<p>
	So your coffee table still looks like a coffee table but it is no longer a coffee table, it is recognized to be the mind of God.

<p>
	Aren't scientific experiments based on what we're interested in? So if a serious scientist makes a discovery in the lab, and some kid is just dicking around in the lab and simply gets a fun, erroneous result, isn't that proof that science happens BECAUSE of us, and not TO US?

<title>Why is Self Conscious a Demeaning Adjective?</title>

<p>
	You just have to be careful with how terms can have different meanings.
</p>

<p>
	"Self-consciousness" is a mainstream cultural term, not a technical term from spirituality. Mainstream culture does not understand what the self or what consciousness is. So understanding that, when ordinary folks say "self-conscious" they are not talking about spirituality or awakening or Truth. They simply mean: a neurotic sense of social anxiety and self-judgment.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be fooled by the surface similarity of terms. Just because two words look the same or sound the same does not mean they have the same meaning.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the problem is not self-consciousness per se, the problem is an obsessive anxiety over one's self-image in social situations. In a sense, the awakened person is not self-conscious when he acts. He's not thinking of his self-image, he acts spontaneously. The self-conscious person self-obsesses and is stuck in monkey mind.

	Same as how Trumpists defend Trump. Rather than admitting Trump's ignorance they explain it away as actually a higher level of intelligence and strategy.

	Stage Blue is prone to mythological thinking. They tend to take myths literally.

	Because I'd have a hard time finding anyone who would understand or appreciate the depth of the things I want to say, so I just focus on buliding my body of work.
</p>

<p>
	The stuff I want to say will only be understood by one in a million people. Who is gonna interview me? Who knows which questions to ask? How many hours would the interview need to be to convey the things I want conveyed?
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Rather than waiting for the right person to ask me things, I just say the right things straight to your face and cut out the middle man.

<p>
	That's his defense mechanism for surviving as the self that he's attached to. That is the function of such emotional reactions.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a baby crying when you take away his favorite blanket.
</p>

<p>
	To your friend, losing his national identity is scary and painful so he's in denial about it because it would seriously threaten his entire worldview. He might have to admit that Islam is not the one true faith. This would lead to a profound existential crisis as he loses his grip on reality.
</p>

<p>
	The mind cannot admit that reality is self-constructed. It needs reality to be objectively real!

<p>
	Understanding and insight goes way deeper than ego or langauge.
</p>

<p>
	Eliminating internal dialogue is not necessary for awakening or insight. You can be going through an awakening and still have access to some internal dialogue which comments on and makes sense of what is happening. An ego self is not required for this.
</p>

<p>
	After an awakening it can be a good practice to sit down and write out what happened to you. This is not ego. This is a good way to clarify things in your mind. It's not enough to just have awakening experience, you also have to then purify the mind. The mind needs to upgrade its logical understanding of itself so it can communicate about these things better. All of this is part of the awakening process.
</p>

<p>
	It is certainly possible to have an awakening but then return to a muddled and confused mind which misunderstands what just happened to it.
</p>

<p>
	You have to grow your mind along with your consciousness.
</p>

	One day Mohammed saw a Bedouin leaving his camel without tethering it, questioned him as to why he was doing this. The Bedouin replied that he was placing his trust in Allah and had no need to tie the camel. The prophet Mohammed then replied, “Tie your camel and place your trust in Allah.”
</p>

<p>
	So don't forget to tie your fucking camel.

	You need to have an awakening to what Love is.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot be told to you in words.
</p>

<p>
	I understand your skepticism, but all happenings truly are an expression of Love. It's too epic to believe. Even when you awaken to it you will be too amazed to accept it. It's too good to be true. Yet it is Truth itself.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help. Take some DPT and ask it to show what is Love. Brace yourself for a mindfucking of unspeakable proportions.

	Your awakening is not complete until you understand why you created it all. It will melt your heart with pure Goodness. It is a Goodness without an opposite.

<p>
	But what you're overlooking is that oneness does not require that you experience my experience.
</p>

<p>
	You have set up that stipulation. Now you must realize that it's you who set up that stipulation, so undo it.
</p>

<p>
	Your fantasies about how oneness must be is getting in the way of realizing how oneness actually is.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness includes twoness and all the rest.
</p>

<p>
	I doesn't make sense because you're not awake. If it made sense, you'd already be awake and we wouldn't need to have this conversation.

	This is simply the dualistic nature of language & distinction.
</p>

<p>
	See my 3 part series about Understanding Duality, where stuff like this was resolved in great detail.
</p>

<p>
	"Spirituality" is used in two senses: relative and absolute. In the absolute sense, everything is Spirit. But in the relative sense we make a distinction between those who are conscious of Spirit and those who are not (the materialists). So even though a materialistic scientist is studying Spirit in this lab when he is doing his chemistry experiments, he isn't conscious that chemicals are Spirit. And so we say he isn't being spiritual. He has mistaken Spirit for matter.

<p>
	It is like that man who mistook a coiled rope in a dimly lit room for a snake.

<p>
	You can't understand it without awakening. And it's too radical to explain to you verbally.
</p>

<p>
	You have to stop being a self to understand it. Your self-hood is getting in the way.
</p>

<p>
	Self-hood is the illusion. There simply isn't no such thing as a self. It's being imagined.
</p>

<p>
	What I'm telling you is: your birth is imaginary. You were never actually born, you simply believe you were.

	Fruits and nuts will not be enough to sustain you. You will be extremely hungry and quit.
</p>

<p>
	It would be more reasonable to light-proof an entire bedroom plus attached bathroom, so you have more space to move around, sleep, and store food.
</p>

<p>
	Right now I pretty much sleep in a pitch black light-proofed bedroom. All the windows and even the door is totally blocked with special thick curtains.
</p>

<p>
	That would be the way to go about it.
</p>

<p>
	Logistical planning for retreats is very important. You need to address all practical issues ahead of time so you can fully focus on the retreat without distraction.
</p>

<p>
	You could even install a small fridge in your bedroom to hold pre-cut fruits, sandwiches, pasta salad, etc. You could stock up on beef jerky.
</p>

<p>
	Serious liberals are all about reducing systemic corruption.

<p>
	"Small government" does not solve the corruption problem, it simply outsources the corruption to cartels and giant corporations where they have zero accountability to the people.

<p>
	Corruption is not a government problem. Corruption is an ego problem. Devilry will happen through all possible mediums, public and private alike.

<title>Objections To Spirituality Mega-Thread</title>

<p>
	I want your help.
</p>

<p>
	As I do research for my book, I want to gather a potent collection of objections to spirituality, nonduality, enlightenment, mysticism, the paranormal, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I want legit objections that newbies and skeptics commonly have in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some examples to get you thinking along the right lines:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		How can you trust that a subjective experience reveals Absolute Truth?
	</li>
	<li>
		Isn't awakening just a subjective brain phenomenon?
	</li>
	<li>
		Could awakening be a self-deception?
	</li>
	<li>
		Is it possible that there's something beyond Absolute Truth which you could be missing?
	</li>
	<li>
		How is awakening different from solipsism?
	</li>
	<li>
		How is awakening different from nihilism?
	</li>
	<li>
		How is awakening different from pantheism?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do awakened people still commit evil acts like sexually abusing their students?
	</li>
	<li>
		If God is real, why would God hide himself from people? Why isn't God evident to all people in the same way that the sun is?
	</li>
	<li>
		If awakening is true, why do all the religions disagree so much?
	</li>
	<li>
		You say reality is infinite, but doesn't quantum mechanics say there is a fundamental lower limit to space known as the Planck Length?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why is love, beauty, goodness, and intelligence a fundamental property of the universe but hate, ugliness, evil, and stupidity are not?
	</li>
	<li>
		If God is so loving why would he allow so much evil in the world like rape, torture, genocide, war, etc?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can you trust psychedelics reveal valid truths and aren't just subjective hallucinations?
	</li>
	<li>
		If science is as wrong about the fundamental metaphysics of reality as you say, how come it's so successful at manipulating reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why couldn't there be more than one God?
	</li>
	<li>
		If physical reality is imaginary, why can't I imagine a million dollars into my bank account or imagine away a physical illness?
	</li>
	<li>
		If what you say is true, how come serious scientists aren't talking about it? Where is your Nobel prize?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I want stuff like that in this thread.
</p>

<p>
	Note: I won't necessarily resolve your objections in this thread. I'm simply trying to gather a solid list of them.
</p>

<p>
	Please formulate your question/objection clearly and concisely.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If you try to reduce meditation to numbers like that, you'll end up shooting yourself in the foot, as you will overlook the most important aspect: quality.
</p>

<p>
	10 minutes of quality meditation is worth more than 10 hours of poor meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Be very careful about pursuing consciousness mechanically or numerically.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Sorry, I don't buy that.
</p>

<p>
	As our environment changes due to technological advancements, the human will be less and less suitable and require further evolution. It's already happening. Natural selection is always culling those who aren't adapting to an ever changing environment. And our environment is changing faster than ever.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as the peak of evolution. Evolution is relative to environment. If you move to Mars, you ain't gonna be at your peak. And humans on Mars will evolve accordingly. The geometry of the solar system doesn't need to change for this to occur. Evolution never stops or peaks out. It is relentlessly ongoing every second of every day.

</p>

<p>
	But for that to work you have to be willing to open your mind beyond what you presently know. And you have to be willing to take such existential question as "Why is reality the way it is?" seriously.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe the question isn't worthwhile to contemplate, then you will get no answer and you will not even know what treasures you missed.
</p>

<p>
	It's like there's a pile of flawless diamonds buried under your bed but you are too incredulous to get a shovel and dig under your bed. I'm telling you guys there's a pile of diamonds here which you have not yet discovered.

Yes, I believe the enlightenment is the way to overcome this fear. I've started meditating 1 hour a day and i seem to be becoming more calm and focused than before. If i do this long enough, let's say 1 year, will it get me a taste of what enlightenment is like? What is the minimum requirement of meditation, self-inquiry, and trip for awakening? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is no formula for awakening. You will only awaken if you awaken. No process can guarantee it.
</p>

<p>
	Judging from my own experience, 1 hour per day is not nearly enough. But it's not a function of brute time, it's a function of effort and quality of concentration.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about awakening, you should be doing week-long meditation retreats at least twice a year. And/or psychedelics and/or Kriya yoga.
</p>

<p>
	That's all very natural. Students emulate teachers until they are finally ready to leave the nest and embark on their own. It might take 5 or 10 years for that to happen. But it will happen if you go deep enough into the work. You will become your own authority figure, grounded deeply in yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect that to happen in your 20's. Maybe around your mid-30's that will start to happen. It takes a long time for a man to find his grounding in life. It's a slow maturation process, like a finely aged wine.

<title>Leo What is your opinion on trip killers?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/37776-leo-what-is-your-opinion-on-trip-killers/?do=findComment&amp;comment=472735</link>

<p>
	I would not use them.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of the trip is to face whatever comes up.
</p>

<p>
	If your protocol is sound, you shouldn't need them.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, if you're the sort of person who might freak out and do something dangerous like jump off a 20 story balcony, then you might want to have some laying around.
</p>

<p>
	But even just having them around will change your trip. Your tripping will be sloppy because in the back of your mind you will know that if things get serious you can escape. This can lead you to second guessing yourself and treating tripping too lightly.
</p>

<p>
	There's an important aspect of tripping where you know that once you've taken the substance, that's it -- you're all in. There's no escape. This helps the surrender process. It also helps you to think twice before tripping because you understand the gravity of the situation. This is no toy or joke.
</p>

<p>
	I would rather not have an escape hatch. But that's me. You might be different.
</p>

<p>
	To me, a large part of the growth I get from tripping is the seriousness of it. It's not a toy to me. And of course I learned this lesson the hard way: by going through some rough trips in the beginning. But I'm glad I did.
</p>

	Inspiring story man! Keep rocking it. You're doing great for your age.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt=":x" data-emoticon="" height="29" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wub.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wub@2x.png 2x" title=":x" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Your desire and intention for awakening & love is the most important thing. As long as you keep that desire stoked in your heart, you will find your way. It just won't be a linear path. Life will have all sorts of twists and turns in store for you.
</p>

<p>
	When you find something that's truly important to you in life, latch onto it like a python and don't let go until life relents and gives you what you most desire.
</p>

<p>
	The beginning is the hardest part. It will get easier.
</p>

<p>
	There are no Yellow cities. Green is the best you'll find, and even that is asking for too much from a city in the 21st century.

<p>
	1) You can teach those things in most major US or European cities with no problem and plenty of eager customers.
</p>

<p>
	2) Remember, part of your job is to help uplift people who are not yet at Yellow. It's too easy to work with Yellow and above people. The real work is helping people get to Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, Jesus did not say: "Let me see which city I can move to to find the most advanced people." He worked with whoever was around. The whole point of being Yellow is that you're able to work with Tier 1 people.
</p>

<p>
	An angle doesn't say: "Let me find the richest, more elite, and most advanced people to help. Fuck the rest of em."
</p>

<p>
	As Yellow and above, part of your burden to bear is that you will be misunderstood a lot.

		</p>

		<p>
			My opinion is that 
		</p>

		<p>
			- government spending should be made more transparent (Ranging from 2-7% for now) 
		</p>

		<p>
			- taxing should be increased on large scale online companies that are soley online 
		</p>

		<p>
			- more funding should be given to the housing department for the projects 
		</p>

		<p>
			- the government should invest in renewable energy for blocks around poor areas , to lower their energy bills. (Bit too far fetched realistically) 
		</p>

		<p>
			- government should regulate Silicon Valley for their investments into tech start up firms 
		</p>

		<p>
			- government should start up their own research branch into fields of interest. Rather than letting the university lead. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I can actually think of 1000 different policies. But I’m asking more generally over the trade offs in areas of government than specific policies 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Those are all generally good ideas. It's just a matter of sorting out the details and setting priorities.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Actually, this is false!
</p>

<p>
	Experience is not experience. The very notion of experience is dualistic and corrupted by ego.
</p>

<p>
	There is truly no such thing as experience. What you consider experience is a conceptual fabrication. What's really there is not experience but Being. This is not just a semantic difference. On this hinges everything.
</p>

<p>
	Right now you are confused, mistaking Absolute Truth for this thing you invented and call "experience." In this way you are maintaining the fantasy that you were born. Your very life depends on not properly understanding what experience is.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind will not allow you understand what I am saying here. Because if you understood what I'm saying here your entire reality would collapse and you'd have a mental breakdown.
</p>

<p>
	You assume you are a biological creature inside a physical space having experiences. This is false. You have imagined: biology, space, time, experience, and your self.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is NOT a subjective experience. Enlightenment is the realization of Absolute Truth. At the moment of enlightenment you literally stop being a biological creature in a physical space. Because in that moment you realize that all of that is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You literally break out of "physical reality". For the first time you see reality as it truly is. You escape The Matrix.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that your whole life has been lived inside a cartoon. And then one day you realize: "OH MY GOD! I am just a cartoon character!!!!" This means that all of science was part of the cartoon. So you cannot use science at that point to ground yourself any more. You realize that science is a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate how radical this is. It is as serious as getting shot in the head. You are going to perceive it as extremely threatening.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Evolution is not a done deal. It is happening every minute of every day.
</p>

<p>
	You have evolved a mind so you can figure out how to adapt to ever changing environments.
</p>

<p>
	Problems are always part of adapting to new environments. Nothing new about this.
</p>

<p>
	It is a problem in and of itself to deny that digital technology is a part of nature. We cannot go back to live in the woods. That would actually be a regression. We must find ways to integrate our technological developments and to make them the new "natural". This obviously needs to be done in a balanced and healthy way. But denying the digital realm is itself pathological.
</p>

<p>
	Powerful new technology requires consciousness to use in a healthy & harmonious way.

<p>
	I don't really buy this.

<p>
	Thoughts don't need a timeline to happen. A timeline is a thought.

<p>

<p>
	Again, this is part true and part false.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "the natural way of doing things". Technology is always advancing. Technology is part of nature. You cannot undo technological advance. Digital reality will only grow stronger and stronger. VR socialization will soon be a big thing. Through VR socialization you will be able to make friends across the whole global, not just your local neighborhood. Digital actually allows us to transcend the limits of physicality. Think about it. That's why digital is to valuable. It's God-like.
</p>

<p>
	Socrates believed philosophy should not be written but only spoken because writing would corrupt the mind. Why did he believe this? Because writing was a new invention in his day and he was set in his ways.

</p>

<p>
	But then the pendulum swings to the opposite extreme where the spiritual seeker turns anti-intellectual, rejecting the mind entirely without realizing that God can speak directly through one's mind using thoughts, images, language, and even as entire manuscripts.
</p>

<p>
	Most people fail to appreciate that God knows all languages in the entire universe. God is using your mind to manifest itself. Since it is formless it needs a limited formed vehicle to express itself. Mind and speech is God.
</p>

<p>
	The only question is: How pure is the vehicle through which God speaks?
</p>

<p>
	How pure is your vehicle? How much is your ego getting in the way?
</p>

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	This thread contains a lot of people talking past one another. We have to be careful in how we define our terms and how we use different mental schemes to explain the unexplainable.
</p>

<p>
	I am not really contradicting Spira or Tolle. I'm just challenging folks here to see the other side of the coin: all thoughts happen now and only now.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that thoughts are so sneaky they mesmerize you into an illusory conceptual world. This is what is meant when people say that thoughts take you out of the now. They don't actually take you out of the now because now is all there is. But subjectively they entrance you. It's like getting lost in a day dream.
</p>

<p>
	Also want to challenge people here to not dismiss thoughts or mind as bad. The Absolute Now can certainly contain thoughts. Otherwise how could thoughts exist???
</p>

<p>
	Elimination of thought is not strictly necessary to be in the now. Newbies commonly get the wrong idea about thought and mind, as if it is an evil that must be eradicated. I wanted to challenge that.

<p>
	That is part true and part false.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately who is to say what is real and what isn't? We make up those definitions.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in person sociaizing is different. But as humanity evolves digital communication will become more and more common and robust. Even digital sex is getting common now.
</p>

<p>
	I've had deeper orgasms through text message than through physical sex. So don't dismiss the digital world as somehow inferior. It has its pros and cons, just like all mediums.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, physical reality is just one medium out of many. Digital reality is no less real than physical reality or imagination.

<title>Is a good period of high mood and excitement, must be followed by period of opposite</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The whole point of true happiness is not to base it on mood.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being happy even when you're in a bad mood. That's real happiness. And it's not easy to develop because our ideas of happiness are so mood based and survival based. Those ideas require deep deconstruction. You have to deeply grok that attachments to physical things and even emotional states always create suffering -- sometimes gross suffering, but sometimes very subtle suffering.
</p>

<p>
	This was a core teaching of the Buddha. And it's a very important point which people overlook. Outwitting suffering is something only a master can do. Suffering is extremely sneaky! Because it's central to your survival. You must literally transcend the entire survival drive to access true happiness.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening allows for superhuman levels of happiness.
</p>

<p>
	Careful.

<p>
	With that said, personally I love lone wolfing life. But that's just me. People here must find whatever kind of lifestyle resonates with them. This is a highly individualized thing.

</p>

<p>
	You must awaken to what Love is to understand these discussions. We are not talking about romantic love here.
</p>

<p>
	This requires an epic enligthenment experience which will melt your cold heart.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate: What is Love?
</p>

<p>
	Hint #1: it is not what you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	Hint #2: psychedelics make this contemplation a lot easier.
</p>

<p>
	Those 5 insights are of course all true and very important to realize.
</p>

<p>
	But there's also a lot more stuff to realize.
</p>

<p>
	The "mechanics" of God are not addressed well by Buddhism.

<p>
	Because you are in a contracted state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Also, since Love is all things, it doesn't necessarily have to be felt. You don't have to like all aspects of reality. Hatred too is a form of love.
</p>

<p>
	Think about what "Everything is Love" entails. That means pain is love. It does not mean that you will never feel pain.

<p>
	The ultimate goal is to realize that there is no difference between form and formlessness.
</p>

<p>
	But to realize this requires surrender of attachment to form.
</p>

<p>
	So again, the entry fee of immortality is death.
</p>

<p>
	Immortality cannot be attained through physical means, it must be attained through spiritual realization. The problem of death is not a physical one the way materialists assume, it is a metaphysical one. You must realize that material reality is imaginary. That your own birth is imaginary. Then you will be free.

<p>
	That is not possible. All forms are impermanent.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that can be immortal is formlessness.
</p>

<p>
	So long as you are identified with any form whatsoever, you are mortal.
</p>

<p>
	Only a devil would claim that God is a selfish devil. So nice try, but no, don't confuse your devilry with that of God. If I let you, you would make a devil out God! See what a devil you are?! Hehe....

<p>
	No, you just misunderstand animals.
</p>

<p>
	As I have repeatedly said, animals are not in God-mode. They are God in animal-mode. This is a big and significant difference.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It is the survival of any limited identity. Any identity attached to any kind of form. Any identity less than the entirely of reality.
</p>

<p>
	So, a kangaroo is committed to surviving as a kangaroo. This makes it selfish. You are commited to surviving as a human. This makes you selfish.
</p>

<p>
	If you weren't bothered by living or dying, you'd be selfless and immortal.
</p>

<p>
	The entry fee for immortality is death.

I'm not saying that's the end, but the beginning.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't what a mystical experience or a samadhi state is, take a psychedelic and they will quickly show you. Then try to get similar results via other methods.
</p>

<p>
	If you have meditated for a few years but never had a mystical experience or samadhi, then you aren't doing it properly or you need to find a better method.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedic to see how much you're meditation is missing.

<p>
	The point of enlightenment is to realize what death is.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot be explained to you in a believable way. You have to experience it to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	Until then you will of course fear death. Because you believe you are real.

<title>Is this what it means for reality to be groundless?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/37736-is-this-what-it-means-for-reality-to-be-groundless/?do=findComment&amp;comment=472269</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	No, that is not what groundless means.
</p>

<p>
	Groundless means that you can never say what the material substance of anything is because anything you claim to be the substance will itself need a further substance to explain it, and so on, to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	You can't claim the substance of any form to be another form, the way science tries to do. You cannot say that a table is made of atoms because the atoms themselves are just another form in an infinity of forms. You must grok that the substance of everything is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to say it is: a table is not made out of atoms. A table is a table. This is tricky to grasp because it is too direct to be grapsed. It is raw Truth/Being. A nondual state of consciousness is required to understand it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Far more important is how you manage your life, regardless of where you are.
</p>

<p>
	As long as you're in a physically safe and free society, that's basically good enough. The real work then begins. The inner work.
</p>

<p>
	If you are in an oppressive violent country, then that is important to resolve.

<p>
	Precisely because a devil is merely God in disguise! Really, there are no devils. A devil is just what we call it when God isn't aware that it's God.
</p>

<p>
	Also, devilry is inherently unstable and self-defeating. The suffering that devilry creates ultimately becomes so strong that the devil is forced to admit he is wrong. Either that or he doubles down and becomes an even bigger devil until finally physical death takes him.
</p>

<p>
	So now you see why death is such an important part of the divine plan of Love. Death is the safety valve which ensures that devils never ultimately prevail. A devil can only prevail in the short-term. God always prevails in the long-term: by killing you and freeing you of all your limits!

	Could you imagine if devils lived forever? Now that would be a problem. Fortunately, <u>all devils must die</u>. Unfortunately, you are a devil. Fortunately, you are also God <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Say... that's a good book title <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	The profoundly twisted irony is this: the devil only behaves like a devil in the first place because he can die! If the devil was immortal he would not act like a devil, he would act like God! If a devil should ever realize that he is actually immortal, he will stop acting like a devil and start acting like God. Ta-da!

<title>Did Leo grew up in a religous Home?</title>

<p>
	To be more accurate, I just have a different kind of social life than most people consider a social life. My social life is through my work.
</p>

<p>
	For example you might ask if the Buddha or Gandhi had a social life. And the answer is, their social life was everything that revolved around their life's work. The same goes for me, except with the added wrinkle that we now live in the digital age, where the notion of "social" has expanded to include all of the activity happening through digital communication.
</p>

<p>
	If you include digital communication, my social life is quite significant.
</p>

<p>
	The very definition of "social life" is flexible and relative and changes across the ages.
</p>

<p>
	If you mean, do I go to the bar and drink beers with people, or attend dinner parties, or go bowling with friends? Definitely not. Such things are not interesting to me.
</p>

	He's using a very loose definition, something along the lines of: anyone who's ever be in a non-symbolic state. But that's very short of what I'm talking about.
</p>

<p>
	I don't consider Jeffery Martin enlightened. Not even close. He's still thoroughly materialistic in his explanations of reality & consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	His research is good, but far short of where this rabbit hole ultimately goes.

<p>
	To me, escaping suffering has never been the goal. The goal has always been understanding reality.
</p>

<p>
	You are right, most people pursue spirituality rather selfishly & narrow-mindedly -- to escape pain or improve their life.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest sages I think pursue it for understanding & Truth, not to escape something negative.

<p>
	I generally agree. People are so different that they have different desires and needs.
</p>

<p>
	But also, not all roads lead to the same place, and there are many partial ways to go about spirituality.

			What pratices are worth training from what you currently perceive to reach the deepest level ? I tried most techniques I've found and the ones recommended by you (besides kriya yoga) I don't really have a preference I get results with most of them, I just need to "up" my practice, which I am shooting for in the near future. I also receive the results described, I've been mostly practicing mindfulness and do-nothing. Also a fair amount of people receive real results from shinzen techniques, most join after praticing other techniques for years and they don't sound deep and shinzens advice does not sound all to deep then, and they don't talk about jhanas, power releams, enlightenment stages or insights, but mostly some life relevant matter about practice.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Shinzen's techniques are good. Will they get you to the deepest levels of understanding? Probably not. But that's okay, they don't need to. A toolbox needs more than one tool in it.
</p>

<p>
	Use Shinzen's techniques, but also don't stop there. Explore other things like psychedelics. I doubt you'll find a technique more powerful than 5-MeO-DMT. But that doesn't mean you should only use 5-MeO-DMT.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's hard to say. We don't have good science on this yet.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking good techniques to try are all the ones I've shared in the past:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Meditation
	</li>
	<li>
		Self-inquiry
	</li>
	<li>
		Strong determination sitting
	</li>
	<li>
		Contemplation
	</li>
	<li>
		Psychedelics
	</li>
	<li>
		Vipassana retreats
	</li>
	<li>
		Solo retreats
	</li>
	<li>
		Yoga
	</li>
	<li>
		Dark room retreats
	</li>
	<li>
		Shamanic breathing
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These are well-worn methods that work for many people.
</p>

<p>
	And in the end, you gotta wonder, is there any other option? Those are the best techniques mankind has developed so far. So you might as well start tinkering around with them. With practice you should find whatever works best for you.

<p>
	All of that is survival. You're still not appreciating what I mean by the notion of survival. It's a much deeper notion than most of you guys here yet realize.
</p>

<p>
	Rest, play, and showing affection is all part of survival. Without them a mammal would be dead.
</p>

<p>
	Animals don't meditate. You're projecting that onto them. They sit and do nothing sometimes. But I wouldn't call that meditation.

	Don't get me wrong, I still like Shinzen as a teacher. Nothing I say here is meant to attack or undermine the work of Shinzen or Ralston or whoever. I'm just adding some extra wrinkles to it.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't have a social life. Never cared to have one. It does not interest me.
</p>

<p>
	I rarely watch movies these days. Hard to find good movies. Most of them are juvenile superhero crap. Occasionally Hollywood makes a good movie for adults. But that's like twice a year. The rest is popcorn spectacles & money machines, which I don't care for.
</p>

<p>
	Occasionally I'll play a video game. When a good one comes out. But again, that's quite rare. Maybe once a year. I don't care for most games. It needs to be something original and deep or artistic.
