<p>
	You can't solve an existential problem at the level of the relative.
</p>

<p>
	That's the point of transcendence.

<p>
	You're not quite seeing how radical Self-Love is.
</p>

<p>
	ANYTHING you do, is Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	If you murder your family, that is Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is unlimited and you cannot ever fail it. Develop the courage to stop judging yourself, others, and reality. That's true Self-Love. Anything less would be ego. Which is also Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	How would you act if you knew you were loved under all choices and circumstances? THAT is liberation. Anything less is slavery.

<p>
	Personally I don't like psychoanalysis. I think it's more deluded than true. There are certainly some bits of truth in it, but also plenty of nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	There are much better resources. You don't want to end up like Slavoj Zizek: academically brilliant, but spiritually dumb as a rock.

Rather than trying to avoid bad trips, your intention should be to go into each trip and accomplish some shadow work. Confront those parts of yourself which you don't want to confront. Sort out your psyche. Slowly work through all your lies, fears, traumas, low self-esteem, grudges, etc. until your mind is pure. Then you will be ready for metaphysical contemplation.

<p>
	Remember, this is a long-term game we're playing.
</p>

<p>
	Slow and steady wins the race. Don't treat self-actualization as a 1 year activity. Treat it like a life-long activity which you have no choice but to do. This should put things into proper perspective.
</p>

<p>
	It's like going to church. People who go to church never think to themselves, "How soon until all this church attendance is done? 3 years? What if I attend three times as much per week? Can I finish it in 1 year?"
</p>

<p>
	No! You go to church for life.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	That's how this problem is solved. Not by sitting around on your ass.
</p>

<p>
	Approaching is very scary if you try to start doing it solo. You basically won't have the balls to do it unless you see a wingman doing it first.
</p>

<p>
	Solo approaching is one of the hardest things to do at first. Your mind will do everything possible to make sure you don't do the approach. It's psychological warfare with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But also solo approaching is where boys become men.
</p>

<p>
	Looks certainly play a big part, more than pundits admit because it renders their punditry useless.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that people vote for very stupid and simple reasons. Which is not good for serious candidates like Bernie.

<p>
	In truth, yes, that's a good insight. But they like to pretend like he is the most progressive candidate out there. For example they will tout how much he is ahead of Bernie.
</p>

<p>
	Of course what they don't realize is that they support Yang not for his policies but for his style and resonance with their Spiral level, which is roughly midway between Orange and Green.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a deep stage. There is a big difference between mild Green and deep Green.

			My point was that winning Wisconsin was not necessarily Trumps strength but the Democrats weakness. Of course there will always be some 3rd party voters, but Steins votes quintupled from 2012 to 2016, which means that Democrats did lose some of their voters to the Green Party and it was not just the regular Green Turnout.
		</p>

		<p>
			Which underlies my initial point that Trump win in Wisconsin was due to a combination of strategic blunders from the democrats and if they correct them, they will be able to carry those states again.

<p>
	All of that is explained simply by Hilary being an uninspiring and unlikable candidate. She's just not a very likable person and her policies were bland.
</p>

<p>
	Many people vote simply based on personality, likability, and overall vibe. They are not doing any sophisticated analysis of anything. It's all by gut feel. Hilary's gut feel was bad. I voted for her, but I wasn't excited about it. I think this was the case for most people who voted for her. Trump had excited fools voting for him.

	That questions seems to lead to the I AM realization. Who you are is pure I AMness.
</p>

<p>
	But going even deeper, who you are is God, the one and only being. Then the question becomes, what is God? What is the "substance" of God, so to speak?

	It's foolish to believe that 3rd party votes could be eliminated and put into the Dem or Rep buckets. There will always be 3rd party votes, so learn to live it with it. They are always there in every election, so this argument that they should go to one or the other major candidate to reverse a loss is silly. Clinton knew Green party members wouldn't vote for her. She should have had enough margin not to need such desperate grasping at straws. She was simply an uninspiring candidate and that is why she lost.

Of course, if you eat tasty food you will get that immediate gratification, but if you listen very deeply you will be able to intuit whether it is actually life-promoting. And that even when the mind is naïve of harmful substances in the food!

	LSD is so freaking powerful you don't need audios to produce samadhi or enlightenment. Just sit and contemplate, "What is consciousness?" or a similar question. In fact, the videos and audios are distracting you from that. Don't consume media on psychedelics. That's like watching porn while you're having sex.

	Just because a thing isn't explicitly on a ban list doesn't mean they will treat you kindly if they catch you with it. That's not how the law works. The law is rarely clear, simple, or black and white.
</p>

<p>
	Which is just another example of nonduality. It's too hard for governments to make absolute distinctions because all distinctions are fluid and ever-evolving.

<p>
	It's silly hairsplitting.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is oneness. Nonduality is oneness.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness is an absolute which includes manyness within it. True Oneness does not create a division between oneness and manyness, nor does it preclude such a division from being made by those minds who wish to make it. In other words, relativity. If you look at the world looking for oneness, you will see it. If you look at the world looking for manyness, you will see it. Because your mind creates the world you see.

<p>
	Well, that's a deep topic. But to me the therapist needs to have a deep grasp of consciousness and trans-personal psychology. They need to know how to think outside the box, not just blindly conform to some cookie-cutter psychoanalytical ideology. They need a metaphysical grasp of the ego, and some degree of personal transcendence of ego.
</p>

<p>
	Without the above, the therapist is basically corrupt and deluded. It then becomes like the blind leading the blind.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if Jordan Peterson was your therapist. God help you.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, it all depends on what your goals are. I am biased towards profound goals with this work. If your goals are more modest, like fixing some minor relationship problem or weight problem, then you don't need such a deeply grounded therapist. Some hack will do.
</p>

<p>
	But if you're going to be doing psychedelics, you're gonna be more conscious than your therapist and your existential issues will be above the therapist's head. In this case the therapist will drag you down into her own delusional materialist "reality". For example, you might tell your therapist that death isn't real or that you are God, and she will tell you you're crazy. But really, she is projecting her own delusion onto you. Because in this case she is the crazy one pretending to be sane. She's just not conscious enough to understand psychological work at such deep levels.
</p>

	If you find a really good therapist it can work. The trick here is finding a really good one. And of course the $$$.
</p>

<p>
	You could also do this with a good life coach.

<p>
	The nature of dating advice is dealing with generalizations. Otherwise we couldn't even assume she doesn't have a dick. Dating involves a lot of assumptions. Many, many things must be assumed to succeed in attracting a woman. First and foremost it must be assumed she wants to sleep with you -- which is a rather bold assumption.

<p>
	Go back to 2015 and find the Vegas odds on Trump winning. Case in point.

<p>
	Steve Bannon himself laughed off the idea of Trump's reelection. Serious Republicans privately understand the deep hole Trump has put them all in. He is digging all their graves. They are playing violin on the deck of a sinking Titanic.

	Don't forget "profound" is a relative term. For simple stage Blue and Orange folk, JP can be profound.

	It's all relative. Of course after you learn nonduality he won't seem profound.

	God created itself. How is that possible? Because God is ONE, it cannot be limited from the outside, since there is no outside. So it is able to do the "impossible". In truth, there is no such thing as impossible for Infinity. So it becomes possible to create oneself.

<p>
	That all depends on your definiton of "self".
</p>

<p>
	The Self I am can reproduce in infinite ways without sex. But if you believe you are a human, then you're stuck. But then again, reproduction is meaningless unless you give it meaning.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I can reproduce myself through words and videos because I do not limit my self to biology as you choose to do. I reproduce myself in your mind. And my reproduction will outlive your children's children.
</p>

<p>
	You should understand that reproduction is a total fiction. Ask yourself why you subscribe to this fiction.

<p>
	Actually, Trump is a perfect reflection of their ACTUAL values. What you have to take into account is that people bullshit about their values all the time. When a low consciousness person says they value love, justice, equality, freedom, honesty, humility, morality, etc. they only say that, but in practice they cannot actually live those values. They live at the same level they vote at. Voting, after all, is living!
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue Christians project a veneer of Turquoise values but live at Stage Blue values.
</p>

<p>
	So someone like Prager can talk about being moral and good and Christian, but when it comes down to it, he will have no problem criminalizing or even killing Muslims, homosexuals, and witches.
</p>

<p>
	You can't fake the values you actually live by. But you can certainly fool yourself and others around you, which is what Prager has done.
</p>

<p>
	The function of all PragerU videos is for Dennis Prager to convince himself and his friends of his own bullshit. And anyone who appears in his videos is doing the same, including JP and the like. It is a textbook definition of self-bias.

<p>
	Whatever would have happened, it would have been meaningless unless you also created a meaning for it, which of course you have already done in your head. You tell yourself that missing these "signs" would be bad. And so that becomes true for you because you say so.
</p>

<p>
	The trap you fell down is the trap of unconsciously creating meaning. And this trap too is meaningless unless you give it meaning.
</p>

<p>
	You create meaning unconsciously as part of your blind survival drive.

<p>
	Exactly. That is proof you created the meaning.
</p>

<p>
	If a thing had inherent meaning, you couldn't search for its meaning. It's meaning couldn't start at zero, and all animals in the universe would agree on its meaning.
</p>

<p>
	See the error in your logic.
</p>

<p>
	The numbers 1 or 2 are totally meaningless symbols. To a dog these numbers mean nothing precisely because these numbers mean nothing until you decide they mean something to you.
</p>

<p>
	Not only is 1111 meaningless, the number 1 is meaningless. It is not even a number to a dog. And so is every other piece of language. Even getting raped or murdered is meaningless. Until you give it a meaning.
</p>

<p>
	You really are not getting this whole business of relativity. Go watch my video Understanding Relativism and contemplate what relativity is.

<p>
	Hehehe... THAT is you creating meaning!
</p>

<p>
	If something had zero meaning, and then acquired a meaning one day, on that day, you created the meaning. In this case, by "research amd study".
</p>

<p>
	You are creating meaning unconsciously. Because you are living unconsciously, like an animal. A human is a meaning-creating animal.
</p>

<p>
	How could something have zero meaning unless it was meaningless to begin with?
</p>

<p>
	You are unconsciously creating meaning by outsourcing it to other humans and authority figures so that you can deny that YOU are responsible. You will say, "But so and so said so!" Yes, and that is you giving so and so meaning and authority over your life. Why do you choose to believe so and so? Only because you are not conscious for yourself and giving away your authority to him.
</p>

<p>
	If so and so told you to jump off a cliff, you'd do it and think it was meaningful.

<p>
	No sourcing discussions.
</p>

<p>
	If you're asking such noob questions, you should not be taking such powerful substances in the first place. Do not do psychedelics without extensive research. You will harm yourself through simple ignorance and make the psychedelic community look bad to boot.

<p>
	No. There's a lot of muddled talk in this thread. The clear answer is this: you can become directly conscious of what God is, why it is, and where it came from.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with falling into the "I don't know" trap. People say "I don't know" thinking that's all there is. But there's actually something here that you haven't discovered yet which you can discover. You can discover precisely what God is. God is not an idea.

<p>
	The contradiction comes from you not being fully conscious of what you are. If you were fully conscious of what you are, you'd realize you are whole and complete. But an ego cannot ever be whole and complete by definition. So you're stuck in an existential bind until such time as you awaken and realize your true nature. But in your current state of conscious you believe you are a limited human self, so of course you will also act in a needy way which will repel others. The less conscious you are, the more needy you are, the more people don't like being around you because your selfishness is repulsive.
</p>

<p>
	Detachment cannot be faked. You must actually become detached.

<p>
	No, if I meant neutral I would have said neutral.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is NOT neutral. It is Absolute Good/Love. You won't be able to understand this from your current state of consciousness because ego is in the way.
</p>

<p>
	The terms have very clear meaning, but you lack the necessary reference experiences to make sense of them, so from your POV they seem to have no meaning.
</p>

<p>
	It's like I am describing love to a person who has never felt it.

<p>
	You are misusing the word simulation. Consciousness is not simulating anything, it is everything. That's a big and important difference.
</p>

<p>
	You don't say that atoms are simulating trees, or wood is simulating a chair. Atoms ARE trees. Wood IS a chair.

This is an ass-backwards approach to being a good human being.
</p>

<p>
	True goodness comes from Self-Love and consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, what you do unto others you do unto yourself. And karma'a bitch.
</p>

<p>
	If you behave in evil ways, don't then act surprised when other do as well. The reality is, you are a devil among you own kind, in a self-created hell, and your morals are just a veil to mask your own devilry from your self.

<p>
	Don't think you can now apply it indiscriminately to things like Mickey Mouse.
</p>

<p>
	Have an appreciation for the limits of scientific modeling.

<p>
	Yeah, 10,000 years ago that was well in place.

</p>

<p>
	You are projecting your ego onto God. It is actually that ego which is an evil, delusional, asshole and devil.
</p>

<p>
	How you see God reflects what you are. If you are a devil, you will see a devil.
</p>

<p>
	Luckily God has infinitely zero ego.
</p>

<p>
	If only you knew how good God is....

</p>

<p>
	And this lesson only cost you $700. That's a good deal. If you learn it.
