<p>
	You are misusing the word simulation. Consciousness is not simulating anything, it is everything. That's a big and important difference.
</p>

<p>
	You don't say that atoms are simulating trees, or wood is simulating a chair. Atoms ARE trees. Wood IS a chair.
</p>

<p>
	It's more twisted than you think. EVERYTHING furthers Absolute Love.
</p>

<p>
	In truth, all your evil is part of Absolute Good.
</p>

<p>
	But also understand, when some devil screws you over, that too will be part of Absolute Good. Remember that when evil is done upon you and you feel some injustice has been done to you.

<p>
	This is not appropriate for this forum.
</p>

<p>
	Don't practice such things on other people. It is highly unethical and against the thrust of our work here.
</p>

<p>
	Keep your nose in your own business rather than practicing the occult on others.

	Direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Stop asking for people to give you stories.
</p>

<p>
	Do you think someone will tell you a story here of your death and you will accept it as true and that will that? Case closed?

This is an ass-backwards approach to being a good human being.
</p>

<p>
	True goodness comes from Self-Love and consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, what you do unto others you do unto yourself. And karma'a bitch.
</p>

<p>
	If you behave in evil ways, don't then act surprised when other do as well. The reality is, you are a devil among you own kind, in a self-created hell, and your morals are just a veil to mask your own devilry from your self.

<p>
	If you have good karma and a good childhood, it shouldn't be so hard.
</p>

<p>
	But also don't get cocky. Acknowledge your privelege. Notice how much worse some people have it.
</p>

<p>
	Let's see how easily you'd awaken if you were raped by your parents for 5 years and forced to survive on the streets somewhere in Africa in the 12th century.

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is a scientific model that is created using questionaires of actual humans in the 21st century.

<p>
	Of course ego is rooted in memory. If memory is disrupted so will ego.

<p>
	To be fair to him, the general population is ignorant about science and so Tyson serves his function in educating Flat Earthers, global warming denialists, and the like.

You don't just start serious spiritual practice overnight. You gotta mature into it through learning, study, and basic self-help. So your desire to learn is all good. It's just the early stages of this process.
</p>

<p>
	Start by making your life the way you want it to be, before you go chasing enlightenment. Learn how to survive well.

<p>
	Ideally speaking, bordem is a reaction of the ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	In practice though, until you deeply awaken and purify the mind through 1000s of hours of meditation, you will suffer lots of bordem. It's a survival function.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way around bordem, you must go through it.
</p>

<p>
	Extreme mindfulness is required for things not to lose their magic. Survival necessarily makes things lose their magic because magic is not important to survival. Magic is a quality of pure Being.

<p>
	Infinite Self imagines it is a trillion finite selves. Otherwise there could not be finite selves.
</p>

<p>
	The illusion is necessary for creation to happen. An infinite thing has no shape or form. If it wants to materialize anything it must take on some limited, finite form. And then of course by definition this limited, finite form cannot understand the infinite.
</p>

<p>
	So reality is stuck in a bind. Either it can be infinite or finite. If it is infinite it loses all form and becomes unremarkable. If it decides to have form, it loses its infinity. You are stuck in this bind.
</p>

This is untrue. That's the delusion of ego.
</p>

<p>
	You do NOT have consciousness or senses! Consciousness is imagining being human and having senses.
</p>

<p>
	You are trying to give Mario an ego. Which is just doubling down on the delusion. What you must realize is that you are not really a living being.

Mystical teaching are not meant to read that way.
</p>

<p>
	B) You are almost certianly reading words that were not written my a highly God-realized being.
</p>

<p>
	C) The tragedy of Jesus was that one of the most God-realized people on this planet was executed by his own kind for speaking truth and love. This is the timeless tragedy of mankind. It's not unique to Jesus at all. Jesus "died for our sins" in the sense that ignorant egos killed an egoless man. God killed God. Happens all the time.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is trying to grant Jesus some kind of unique status. If you do that, you completely miss the point.
</p>

<p>
	The people who worshipped Jesus did not really understand him. So stop taking their words seriously, as if they knew God. When you really know God, Jesus becomes irrelevant.

With a surface level understanding of those terms it can seem like you're shifting when really you aren't. Make sure you understand what those terms mean.

<p>
	Learning dating is about as challenging as learning biz. It will take some years to sort through the BS. And just like learning biz, it's worth it. So jump right in. Don't worry about having it all figured out now. That's not possible. It is an epic journey.

	Until your awakening, you don't even know what real happiness feels like. You are in constant survival mode.

<p>
	Merely knowing about Spiral Dynamics and doing a few psychedelic retreats does not mean much. It's easy for the ego-mind to act spiritual and developed without actually being so. This is the norm. It's pretty easy for the ego-mind to compartmentalize its survival, such that in one part of its life it runs a scam to earn money while in another part of its life it attends spiritual retreats and talks about spiritual things. The two work in tandem. The ego-mind is very clever about its survival. This kind of thing is common. Just like how rich people donate a bit of money to charity to make themselves feel like they actually care about the poor and inequality.
</p>

<p>
	Also, today Stefan might be above Orange, but you are talking about his past work. How long ago was that? Perhaps he's Green now and his work from 5 years ago was Orange.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at my work from 5 years ago, it was also pretty Orange. Not scammy, but still.

			Yeah, so you became God and fully conscious that you imagine stuff up. The point is how you take it is your choice, a matter of perspective. Even if I became fully conscious of how I imagine a rock, to say that it's therefore less real doesn't fit well with me. I would simply understand that imagination=reality, reality=imagination, no difference.

<p>
	This is exactly what late-stage capitalism looks like. The total debasement of society for success, fame, sex, and money.
</p>

<p>
	A late stage Orange society getting ready to shed its skin and move into Green. Before a rebirth a collapse is necessary. This is what rock-bottom Orange looks like.
</p>

<p>
	There's still a question of how bad this rock-bottom will get. Will it be a quick recovery or a deep, painful decent into hell? No one knows yet.

	And what did the Buddha do? What did Christ do? What did Muhammad do? What did Moses do? What did Joseph Smith do? What did Yogananda do? What did Sun Myung Moon do?

<p>
	Bodhisattvas build large movements which later become dogmatic religions and perpetuate ignorance through collective ego.
</p>

<p>
	This story has been played out since the dawn of human civilization.

<p>
	No one is to blame for this. It's inevitable given how consciousness works. You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.

<p>
	That's real. There is a fascistic element in all right-wing politics around the world and it can get out of hand if allowed to get far enough. If Trump goes down hard, he will take the rest of the country with him, that's for sure. His ego will not allow him to lose quietly or admit defeat. If he loses the election he will try to take the democracy down with him by poisoning the well.

	Ironically, Trump is probably too much of a coward to start a nuclear war. Big ego = lots to lose.

<p>
	Someone like Hitler was willing to put his own balls on the chopping block. Trump is not. He is not competent enough to be a dictator, LOL. He's a fake dictator!
</p>

<p>
	In a true dictatorship Trump would be deposed by someone more cunning, hard-working, disciplined, and bloodthristy. The only thing protecting Trump is the America bureaucracy, or "deep state" as he ignorantly calls it.

	Is last night's dream real? Is Santa Claus real?
</p>

<p>
	The rock will only become less real when you are directly conscious that it is something you imagine. Right now you are just playing intellectual games. You are not actually conscious that the rock is imaginary. There is no substitute for consciousness here.

	It's pretty clear he has. Although he's not someone I would call a serious seeker of truth. At least he wasn't when he was doing most of his tripping. He was a kid doing it recreationally.

<p>
	That is not due to the psychedelic. That is because most people who stumble into psychedelics are highly dysfunctional drug addicts with lots of shadow issues and terrible karma due to abuse, bad childhoods, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Generally well-functioning members of society don't encounter psychedelics. You have to go out your way to use them due to the social stigma.
</p>

<p>
	Most trip reports I read are written by highly dysfunctional, impure, and immature people.
</p>

<p>
	Look at PsychedSubstance's trip reports, for example. Stupidity on stilts.
</p>

<p>
	Today he's more mature though. So good for him. But unfortunately psychedelics are still such an underground thing that lots of low-lives do them, giving them a bad reputation.

<p>
	What more is there to say? If you look up the textbook defintions of those terms they tell you basically what it is.
</p>

<p>
	Karma is basically the sum total of everything you imagine you and reality are -- your entire memory bank, including genetics, or whatever other thing you made up to explain why you are how you are.
</p>

<p>
	Memory, genetics, history, life story... it's all basically the same thing. These are anchors for the ego's reality.

	Personally I have not encountered any heavy side effects.

<p>
	Some people can get HPPD and the like. So there are some risks. Then again, meditation and kundalini awakening also carries some risk of side-effects.

<p>
	Some spiritual schools do. Weed and datura have been used in India for millennia by some schools. And then there is the ancient psychedelic drink called Soma, the contents of which we don't know for sure, but was likely similar to magic mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	I'll tell you this much, if the Buddha has access to 5-MeO-DMT, I don't doubt he'd use it. Are we really supposed to believe that a guy who nearly starved himself to death in pursuit of Truth would have refrained from taking a psychedelic?

	Sure, but this is basically spirituality by Russian roulette. Do you really want to play such a game?

<p>
	How many people die each year from playing such games? You don't hear about them. There are some 50,000+ suicides per year in the US alone. How many of them could have been avoided with some strategic use of psychedelics? A lot.

			What would be interesting to know is how much easier it was for them to awaken vs someone who didn't have these experiences in their youth.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It can still be difficult for them. Plenty of spiritually gifted people have harrowing journeys to awakening (like the many classic shaman stories). So don't get the idea that being spiritually gifted makes this process a walk in the park. You can be spiritually gifted and still have a lot of shadow material to work through.
</p>

<p>
	But the biggest thing is, most people will never even attempt to awaken or know about awakening otherwise, unless they are lucky enough to stumble upon it.
</p>

<p>
	A big secret to successful awakening is have the right motivation, curiosity, and desire for it. That in itself is a very rare thing which already requires a certain degree of spiritual attunement. If you motivation is strong, the rest is just a matter of time. If you motivation is weak, almost nothing can help you. So getting your motivation straight is crucial. Which is where psychedelics can be especially helpful. People would be a lot more motivated to awaken if they had a direct experience of God or Infinite Consciousness. It's very hard to build motivation off hearsay and fairytales. It's crucial to experience God for yourself so you know that it is more real than a brick wall. It's very hard to be motivated to pursue a thing for years which you doubt is real.
</p>

			How did you come to the conclusion that most masters are spiritually gifted? It seems like a hard thing to investigate scientifically.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not so hard really. If you ask most masters about their childhoods and how they got into spirituality, many of them will tell the same story of having spontaneous (psychedelic-like) mystical experiences, kundalini activations, astral projection, lucid dreaming, etc. when they were in their teens. Not to mention that basically all of them were deeply interested in metaphysical and spiritual questions from their youth. It is not at all an accident that they got involved in spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	I notice this in myself. I was born a philosopher. I would estimate I have double the baseline level of consciousness of the average human and my sensitivity to psychedelics is at least double or triple that of a typical human. But even so, I never had spontaneous mystical experiences as many masters do. So I am nowhere near the top of the bell-curve of spiritual giftedness. But it is no accident that I ended up in this line of work.
</p>

Do you think sadhguru, osho, eckhart tolle and others naively assume that everybody is just like them? I honestly dont know the answer to that.

<p>
	No, they just skirt the issue and teach to a very mainstream audience -- whoever will listen and pay. Besides, what do you expect them to do about it? They can't recommend psychedelics because 1) they have no serious experience with them, and 2) most of their followers can't access them, and 3) they would get into trouble.
</p>

<p>
	The more mainstream the teacher, the more mainstream and mild his techniques need to be.
</p>

<p>
	Do you really expect Sadhguru to stand up in front of 10,000 people and tell them point blank: 99% of you will not awaken? Why would he do this? Of what benefit is this to his followers or his organization?
</p>

<p>
	Also, when you are highly spiritually gifted from birth you have no idea what life is like for people who are not spiritually gifted. It is like living in a different reality. So easily many teachers can be dismissive of the struggles of newbies and normies.
</p>

<p>
	You have to ask yourself, what is it you want and how badly do you want it? Do you really care to know what reality is? How important is it to you that you discover the answers in this lifetime?
</p>

<p>
	See, Sadhguru's agenda is not that. He will not resolve this for you. He is busy building his organization. If you die without reaching the ultimate answers, it won't bother him one bit. But if it would bother you, then you need some sort of reliable plan for how you're going to get those answers.
</p>

It's just a way to understand reality at the highest and deepest level which would otherwise be virtually impossible.
</p>

<p>
	The psychedelic will motivate you to get serious about the work. You basically won't understand half the things I say until you do some psychedelics. And then the real work can begin.
</p>

<p>
	Most of those gurus became awakened by fluke luck, so it's not wise to count on that happening to you. You are not Sadhguru, so don't expect his results. You are you, so you must deal with the cards life has dealt you. Life has dealt most of you bad cards, so you will want every tool at your disposal to overcome that.
</p>

<p>
	If you insist on crawling up the mountain on your belly, go for it. But you could also just take a helicopter.

<title>How to embody lightworker life purpose?</title>

<p>
	So start working on building the skillset you'd need to do that job. Whatever that entails. It might start with reading certain books, or taking certain classes, or finding mentors, or just cleaning up your own life.
</p>

<p>
	If you have no vision and no motivation to build your skillset, then you're stuck until such time you do.
</p>

<p>
	What does it look like to be light worker? What kind of skillset is required? Think about the in lots of detail and then create a plan for how to move in that direction. It's not rocket science. But it will require some serous vision and dedication.
</p>

<p>
	What is the point of building a deep relationship if you two are already agreed that it will end within months?
</p>

<p>
	Don't kid yourself. What will realistically happen is that as soon as she or you hook up with your next partner, you will forget all about her and there will be no friendship left at all, since the function that this person served in your life will be gone.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that relationships are functional, transactional exchanges. If the function is lost, the relationship will fall away. The relationship must serve both of you in some significant way. Once you hook up with someone else, this old relationship will actually become a potential threat to the new thing you got going.
</p>

<p>
	I would not waste too much time trying to maintain this thing if you are already clear it will not last. You are young and in university you will encounter a thousand other girls into whom you can invest your energy. Likewise on her end. She will almost certainly forget about you once she hooks up with her next guy.
