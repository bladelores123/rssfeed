<p>
	It's not right to compare them with MDMA. I don't experience much elevation in heart rate from 5-MeO-DMT or DPT.
</p>

<p>
	But of course taking them daily is overkill. No one is going to take those substances for more than a few days in a row. It just gets too intense. The most I've done was 13 days in a row, and it's just way more nonduality than a human could want.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I think that's generally true, but this notion of "absolute" is quite problematic because in practice you can be in a state of little to no self-involvement and yet not be conscious of important facets of reality. I prefer to think of these as somewhat independent variables, with both being desirable and both being synergistic. Insight helps overcome defilements, and overcoming defilements helps attain deeper insight into the metaphysics of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Historically it just seems pretty clear that there were gurus and masters who have had very deep metaphysical insight yet still plenty of defilements.

<p>
	That's simply explained by the fact that you identified strongly with your cat but not your relatives.
</p>

<p>
	When you own a small cat it feels like your baby and so you feel much more responsible for it.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, the meaning you assign to objects and people is purely relative and imaginary. So if you get attached to a coffee table, you will mourn its loss.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	Insight is the thing that allows you to even know what a defilement is. And insight is what gets you free of defilement.
</p>

<p>
	Desire for more insight certainly can become neurotic if you turn it into a rat race sorta thing. But it don't have to be that way.
</p>

<p>
	Make a distinction between healthy and unhealthy pursuit of truth and understanding.

<p>
	LOL
</p>

<p>
	You know not what you speak.
</p>

<p>
	When psycho-analysis allows you to contact machine elves and communicate with them through multiple dimensions of  symbolism and telepathy, or to get direct downloads from the mind of God, or to pull demonic spirits out of a patient's body, then let's talk. Playing violins is kindergarten stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You do not understand how psychedelics work.
</p>

<p>
	You do not even know what symbols truly are until you do some heavy tripping.
</p>

<p>
	To say that psychedelics are a "just a chemical" is a silly as saying that therapy is just a chemical. Everything is chemicals by that logic, including all symbols and your therapist. That therapist is just a soup of chemicals. This sort of selective, reductionist logic is a telltale sign of self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	I never said therapy doesn't work. Of course it works. But psychedelics work 1000x faster.
</p>

<p>
	If you have to ask "What do you mean by God?" you are not conscious of what God is.

<p>
	Yes, God is Consciousness, but that doesn't mean you're conscious of God.
</p>

<p>
	God is God and cannot be reduced to any other insight. God is not anything else but God. The insight of God is very distinctive. You'll know it only when you become it.

	If you don't know what God is, just be honest with yourself that you don't know, rather than playing mind games.

</p>

<p>
	But now reframe how you think of it. Rather than seeing this as "being all alone", see it as "I am in total union with all beings!!!"
</p>

<p>
	When you are making passionate love to a woman/man, are you alone? Yes! Because you two are one. But that just makes it better! That is the whole point! Not aloneness but Unity.
</p>

<p>
	YOU. ARE. UNITY! <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Aloneness as an absolute includes within it all forms of togetherness.
</p>

<p>
	What you must realize is that the pinacle of togetherness is aloneness.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	For example, are you conscious right now of how Universal Mind is materializing your physical body? I'd guess not. This requires a radical degree of consciousness than even most awakened people do not have.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I have become conscious of how I create every molecule in my own body. This realization has nothing to do with removing defilements.
</p>

<p>
	I have a more mystical answer for ya.
</p>

<p>
	Democracies go to war less simply because they have a higher level of collective consciousness. The more conscious one is, the less violent one is.
</p>

<p>
	A more mundane reason is trade. Democracies trade a lot more with each other. War disrupts trade and ruins economies. In a democratic country if the economy starts to sour the politicians will be immediately kicked out of office by angry voters.
</p>

<p>
	Trade is one of the strongest practical deterents to war.
</p>

<p>
	Why would you want to murder someone you're doing good business with?
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	In the end, everything is one.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you could equate Love and creativity. Creativity is a quality of Infinite Consciousness or Universal Mind -- which imagines all objects. Creativity is imagination. All creativity happens out of Love and for the sake of maximizing Love.
</p>

<p>
	Creativity is not seperate from Creation itself. They are one.
</p>

<p>
	The creativity you feel inside your mind is a tiny sliver of God's infnite creative capacity. God is literally using your mind to create through you. You are inspired by Spirit. You are In-spirit-ed. Your body is made out of spirit but your mind is also enspirited.
</p>

<p>
	Creativity is infinite and unlimited, giving rise to the infnite world of finite forms.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	SSRIs are not good for you. So you should have a plan for weaning off them regradless of psychedelics. You want your mind as free as possible for this work.
</p>

<p>
	I know weaning off them is hard, but see it as an investment into your future.
</p>

<p>
	For stuff like mild depression, psychedelics will be way more effective than antidepressants. Psychedelics will address the root cause of depression and will help you find peace.
</p>

<p>
	If you kick antidepressants you can do weekly trips and that will help you stay grounded.
</p>

<p>
	You can also experiment with microdosing LSD. Although I prefer large bi-weekly trips vs microdosing.
</p>

<title>5 Meo DMT and SSRI Interaction</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	So why not wean yourself off SSRIs first?
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is not merely that 5-MeO will reveal crazy truths.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that there can be a bad interaction between these two chemicals in your brain, causing the trip to turn very sour and possibly even lethal. If that happens your trip will spiral out of control. You will not be able to think your way out of it.
</p>

<p>
	When taking psychedelics you gotta consider possible interactions with other medicines very seriously. You don't know what kind of synergy could result.
</p>

<p>
	Do your research. And even then, I would not advise it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You should know that cancer recovery rates can be significantly improved through proper daily visualization technique. This has been validated by clinical research.
</p>

<p>
	So I highly recommened you learn it and start doing it daily.
</p>

<p>
	PM me if you want some further instruction.

</p>

<p>
	I don't understand why you would be taking 5-MeO while on antidepressants.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is very radical. It will reveal shocking truths. Can you really handle that?
</p>

<p>
	Why are you on SSRIs to begin with?

</p>

<p>
	I basically agree with all that except that even if all fear and all attachment is eliminated, there will still remain many degrees of insight into the fundamental nature of reality.
</p>

<p>
	My claim is this: you could remove all those defilements but still be missing important existential sights such as What is Love? Or What is God? etc.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like your trips were very mild. Seems like you have a toleramce to LSD or weak blotter.
</p>

<p>
	Your intention is fine, if that's what you really want. But the real power of LSD will shine once you get over all your psychological needs and start setting metaphysical intentions. Like, What is reality?
</p>

<p>
	I would trip sitting up, not laying down.
</p>

<p>
	Tripping outdoors is tricky. Start by doing 10 or 20 trips indoors where you have full control of environment and isolation from disturbing people.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	There are many theories.
</p>

<p>
	One of the them is that Europe is so highly develop precisely because it has been so competitive. So many different cultures clashing and fighting for over 4000 years. This constant battle and the two world wars lead to so much suffering that people learned to chill out.
</p>

<p>
	Competition creates technological advancement, which drives evolution of social and intellectual structures to sustain it.
</p>

<p>
	There is also a theory that it's harder to rule people in a hot environment. Hot environments are more conducive to tyrannical forms of rule. Not sure how much I buy that, but it's one theory.
</p>

<p>
	Europe also had abundant natural resources and it's easier for people to move horizontally across the global than vertically due to climate change on the vertical axis.
</p>

	These kinds of emotional reactions are a dead-giveaway of dogma. People react like that when they are defending an ideology. There is nothing logical about libertarian ideology despite any appeals they might make to logic. All the logic is a backwards-rationalization to justify one's dogmas.

			Well, for the reasons I laid out in my previous post, this makes zero sense.
		</p>

		<p>
			You’re commenting without actually understanding how or why therapy works. When a psychedelic enables someone to play the violin without ever having picked one up before, or learn German without studying, you can make these sorts of claims. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And I’ve had trips and have talked to people who have had many, many trips.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Talk therapy can be helpful but it is notoriously inefficient at resolving deep psychological issues. There have been studies done on this. People go to therapy for years and show only mild improvements. The studies and the anecdotal evidence backing up the effectiveness of psychedelics is simply too voluminous ignore.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with tripping is that it can be done in very different ways. Some ways are frivolous. And most people who do psychedelics are not serious, they are dicking around. I've read so many idiotic trip reports that it amazes me how often people misuse psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	If psychedelics were widely available and people where taught to properly use them, I'd guess that 50% of therapists would be out of a job.
</p>

<p>
	There are aspects of your psyche which can be accessed on psychedelics which you will never access sober or with a therapist. And I don't believe there is anything a therapist can help you access which a psychedelic cannot.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe you've done psychedelics but it does not seem like you've realized their full potential yet. Perhaps because you were already fairly pure before taking them. Or simply because you have some sort of natural tolerance to them (as some people do).
</p>

<p>
	I'm not really saying anything bad about therapy. It think it's a good method for some. But I just don't see how it can match the power of psychedelics. Verbal analysis of psychological issues is simply very indirect. It's the same problem as trying to verbally talk someone into awakening. It's highly inefficient.
</p>

<p>
	What kind of psychotherapy allows someone to play the violin without practice????
</p>

<p>
	Let me put it this way: if I had a daughter who was raped, I would not a trust a psychotherapist to heal her trauma. I would send her to do some psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	My ex-girlfriend was an alcoholic and had panic attacks because she was sexually abused in her teenage years. She went to therapy for years. She was still extremely dysfunctional to the point where I could no longer be in relationship with her. She could not handle honesty at all and she was extremely insecure. If she went to therapy for another 5 years, I doubt it would solve her issues.
</p>

<p>
	There is a reason why AA was founded on LSD. AA minus the LSD is much less effective.
</p>

<p>
	Seriously contemplate: What is the value of feminism? Why did this social movement arise? What legitimate problems has it addressed and what legitimate problems is it still addressing?
</p>

<p>
	Get curious about studying it. Seek to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	This will put you in the right frame of mind.
</p>

<p>
	Understand that women are not asking for more rights. They are asking for decent and fair treatment and for respect of the feminine way of life.
</p>

<p>
	This is not merely an issue of strictly equal legal rights. This is an issue of an under-representation of feminine values in mainstream culture and centers of power. Women have a unique way of experiencing the world and dealing with problems. As men, and as a hyper-macho society, we can benefit greatly from adopting some of those ways. All without becoming emasculated. We can benefit a lot from feminine leaders. Not just women who act like cold bossy men. But truly feminine leadership style.
</p>

<p>
	This is in fact one of the easiest ways to reduce violence around the world: put more women in charge.
</p>

	By that logic Hitler could not be stopped.

<p>
	Violence is actually not the opposite of love or awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Violence happens precisely because it is part of the Ultimate Good. Some things cannot be resolved other than through violence. That's the paradox.
</p>

<p>
	The Hitler issue was resolved by fighting the devil head-on, not by Spiral Dynamicing him. My point is that no amount Spiral Dynamics or Integral Theory would have resolved that issue, and that it might have made it worse. No everyone can be negotiated with. Negotiation has certain prerequisites.

<p>
	It begins as armchair philosophy, and as you become more serious, it turns into true contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there is no clear line between the two, as that would be just another duality.

<p>
	I suspect this is true.
</p>

<p>
	I have not verified it conclusively because I've never done it orally.
</p>

<p>
	But the plugged experience is so intense and different than typical 4-AcO-DMT trip reports that I assume plugging it really is different.
</p>

<p>
	It's like the most intense version of mushrooms. I hesitate to take that shit again. It's like 5 hours of nonstop mindfuckery.

<p>
	The deepest trip I've ever had in my life came from plugging 4-AcO-DMT. It was so nondual that you wouldn't believe. I stopped being able to tell that I was human.
</p>

<p>
	But of course that's because I've done many trips to build myself up to this point.

<p>
	You guys should not even be talking about feminism until you've read 10 books about it.
</p>

<p>
	So much foolishness in this thread that I can't even bother reading it.
</p>

<p>
	Suffice it to say you have no historical context for women's rights and you have a massive male self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	This problem can only be solved with serious study and education.
</p>

<p>
	By all means be a man, but don't do it by creating an anti-woman ideology. Imagine being a man without being threatened by the success and empowerment of women. That's what true masculinity looks. A mature man would understand and support the basic aims of feminism. A juvenile man is thratened by it.
</p>

<p>
	It's this kind of nonsense which is why I sharply criticize JP. He helps spread this cancer of the mind.

<p>
	What this misses is that actions must happen regardless. Just sitting back and saying "Well, Hitler will resolve itself. I will do nothing because it doesn't bother me." is a dysfunctional way of embodying spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	You are not just a passive observer of life, you are right at the heart of its unfoldment. The choice to do nothing is still a choice. Sitting back and letting others fight Hitler for you is rather lazy and irresponsible. Because once Hitler gets to your front yard, you will wish you'd done something.

			Leo, just because your past includes getting away from the image of the nerd and the 4chan troll, doesnt mean you have to constantly demonize them and act as like they are just pathetic man-children who cant get their act together. There is a real reason more and more men feel disenfranchised and completely helpless. Many of them were never given any help and even told the opposite of what is true about girls. Many of them did not grow up with a father and therefore suffer under completely one-sided, overly sensitive and overly nurturing parenting. They were given no proper tools whatsoever to be a successful man, I dont blame them for feeling anger. They have no connections to society whatsoever, thats why they dont care to shoot it up.

<p>
	If you really care about unity, then stop parroting this ideology and go read some books on feminism with an open mind.

	You need to step outside your male perspective and look at society from the POV of women. Which is precisely what you won't want to do. And this is what's creating your perceived division. If you would see the world from the POV of women, your projection of division would cease and unity would result. You would also become happier and you'd be more successful with relating to women.

	Stage Blue can be extremely genuine in its devotion. That isn't the problem. The problem is that they cannot recognize that their devotional path is just one out of many others and not the best. This leads to a monomaniacal devotion which never doubts itself, where the ends justify any wicked means.

<p>
	How would you describe the actual process of shedding subconscious and instinctual defilements?
</p>

<p>
	What causes that to happen vs not?

When we talk about Absolute Love we are not talking about what you'd normally think. This existential Love is a much deeper notion than just human feelings, emotions, moods, personal likes, or some positive orientation towards certain objects.
</p>

<p>
	Love is the very physical substrate of reality. So think of it this way: reality is not made out of atoms or matter, reality is made out of Love. Once you understand that, you can see how even someone like Hitler is made out of pure Love. It's not that I personally have to love Hitler. It's that Hitler is literally carved out of Love. Love is his physics, we might say. The atoms don't care if Hitler kills people or is nice to people. Likewise, existential Love doesn't care if Hitler is a mass murder.
</p>

<p>
	In this sense, hate is literally made out of Love. In the same way that a scientist would tell you that hate is made out of atoms.
</p>

<p>
	Existential Love can behave in different ways: it can smile, it can laugh, it can be nice, it can say sweet words, it can kiss you on the head, or it can murder you and boil your skull for dinner.
</p>

<p>
	You may object to the murdering or boiling, but Love is so strong it doesn't care about your human squeamishness and aversions.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When you recommend psycho-analysis to supplement this work, that's exactly why I recommend psychedelics. Just like psycho-analysis the psychedelic's function is not primary to enlighten you but to clear out lesser blockages, shadow issues, and to show you what is getting in way of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	The benefit of psychedelics is that it's faster, cheaper, more direct than months of talk therapy, and gives awakenings as well. But of course for those who cannot access psychedelics, I can see the value of psycho-analysis.
</p>

<p>
	I've not done formal psycho-analysis but I'd guess 3-12 months of psycho-analysis = 1-3 psychedelic trips. The cost savings would also be very significant.
</p>

<p>
	I've noticed that most people who take psychedelics don't have very deep awakenings on them because first the psychedelic must clear out psychological baggage (AKA, psychoanalysis). The existential insights require a purified mind and heart. The deep existential insights tend to come in later trips, after the mind has been purified a bit of its human baggage.
</p>

<p>
	Just a useful insight I thought I'd share with you guys.
</p>

<p>
	The oversight I made in the past is that I tended to think of the psychedelic purely as a gateway to nondual states. But that's only half of their function. The other half is the psycho-analytic resolution of psychological baggage.
</p>

<p>
	I found that when you start this journey it tends to be quite neurotic and not very effective. But at the same time, you can only start where you're at, so neurotic practice is better than no practice at all.
</p>

<p>
	You problems could be answered with a couple of deep psychedelic trips, where you would face the real existential root of your dysfunctions and let them go. Then you could proceed with a more organic spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	The value of the psychedelic is not so much in that it enlightens you, but that it clearly shows you what is preventing you from awakening, what is holding you back. Otherwise you could waste years chasing your tail in circles.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest challenges of the spiritual path is what we get in our own way. We all have unique ways of getting in our own way. Psychedelics help you understand your unique ways of getting in your own way so you can stop doing it. It tends to not be enough to just intellectually know how you get in your own way. You need a deep mystical experience of it to learn the lesson and change your ways.
</p>

<p>
	Intellectual efforting here just tends to be very slow and needlessly ineffective compared to a few psychedelic trips which will just bombard you with all the answers in a way that no book, therapist, or guru could.
</p>

<p>
	Really, once you learn how to properly use psychedelics, you will never need a teacher or book. The most powerful answers are in your trips. Everything else is weak sauce that literally wastes years of time and thousands of dollars in money.
</p>

	Love as an absolute has no opposite. In the same way that existence has no opposite. Non-existence is just an existent idea. Hate is a relative aspect of absolute Love.

		<p>
			After a little research I found that although they are a linear progression his 'advanced courses' vary greatly. SG mentions several times that the first of his 3 advanced courses are for people who want to enhance their wellbeing (Bhava Spandana). Only the last course (Samyama) is meant for a seeker aka the real deal.

<p>
	I don't remember what he completed.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sure Sadhguru has some very advanced students who are deeply enlightened. But that's probably pretty rare given how mainstream Isha has become. Most people doing it are dabblers who don't even know what enlightenment means. They are doing it for personal health benefits or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	Overall I don't have any problem with Sadhguru's teachings. I'm just not the type who will ever follow a single guru.

			I believe that the main problem of the Israeli left is blaming Netanyahu for destroying the country, and not taking any responsibility. So many Israelis are so focused on him, and no one is really looking for a real deep solution for both sides.
		</p>

		<p>
			Leo, it is very much like you said in your conciseness politics mini-series. Each side (Israeli right and left) is self-biased and no one goes within to find whats really needs to be done. The Israeli left is so stuck on a victim position, it might be the reason the country is so stuck in deeply-blue orange state.        But at the same time, the country is only 70 years old and most of the right wingers came to here in the 50s from eastern states while they were really into red-blue position - So I believe we’re really progressing into more and more green. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't know much about the Israeli left, so I can't speak to those internal politics. I'm more looking at Israel as an outsider and criticizing it from an outsider's perspective. From an outsider's international perspective is seems that Israel's conservative party has hijacked the country and behaves unfairly towards Palestinians by trying to make a two state solution impossible with sneaky settles. I see this is a right-wing collective egotism which lack empathy for Palestinians.
</p>

<p>
	So my only point is that just devilry should be called out and not encouraged (the way the American right-wing likes to do).

<p>
	It's not a matter of belief. You are God, you are One, and you are all things. It's not that I'm talking to myself, it's that you're talking to yourself. If it seem like you're talking to me that's because you've adopted the belief in separate human beings.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness is a radical thing.

At first this organization would seem noble and good. But over time thing would spiral out of hand and some giant spiritual ego would take it over, thus turning 5-MeO-DMT into a tool of the devil.

	I hear what you're saying. But I just wonder, when the Nazi's were coming to power in the 30's, what would you have proposed?
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that when you negotiate with fundamentalists they take and take and take and give nothing in return.
</p>

<p>
	I'm curious how you would negotiate with conservatives in America. Obama tried to appease them and it didn't work. They still smeared him as a socialist and undermined him at every turn.
</p>

<p>
	How would you deal with Trump and his evangelical base? You think they are going to negotiate with you and give any ground to stage Green? Would you advocate not to put pressure on the migrant concentration camps at the US border & on Trump?
</p>

<p>
	Vocal outrage can be an effective tool for social evolution as most people are complacent and unaware of what's really happening in society. The outrage can make people aware of the issue.
</p>

<p>
	I have read Elza Maalouf's book.
</p>

<p>
	I am really curious how you negotiate with people who precisely do not want rise above their worldview? Sometimes I feel like Integral Theory is too naive and idealistic about how ruthless politics can be.
</p>

<p>
	What do you consider the solution to Trump? Is it better to elect a centrist Democrat or a far left one like Bernie Sanders who will put pressure on the corporate domination of US politics and drive hard towards Green?
</p>

<p>
	I feel like Obama's approach towards the conservatives was somewhat stage Yellow, yet it did not work out so well because the conservatives just took advantage of of his moderation and willingness to compromise.
</p>

<p>
	When one side is acting like a devil, what do you do according to Spiral Dynamics? Because the devil is certainly clever enough to take advantage of a moderate Spiral Dynamics approach.

<p>
	Notice how tricky such things are.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why politics is so messy and dirty.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, all politics is survival.

<p>
	There is no such line because everything is relative.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, 150 years ago millions of people believed they had the right to own slaves.
</p>

<p>
	That's relativity.
</p>

<p>
	What's even crazier is that since you are all beings, you were one of them! So your judgment of slaveowners is itself self-bias! How do we get everyone in the world to acknowledge that he/she owned slaves at one point?
</p>

<p>
	LOL, good luck with that one.

</p>

<p>
	Our Statue of Liberty says, "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free..." yet we hold asylum seekers in concentration camps right this minute.
</p>

<p>
	Zionism may have good intentions, but the practical result of such an ideology results in putting Jews first, above all others. Which is problematic.
</p>

<p>
	I know there are many Jews who don't support the right-wing Israeli government. Good for them. Be more vocal.

<p>
	The body is a hallucination, just like everything else.
</p>

<p>
	There is no fundamental difference between your body and your thoughts -- if you are conscious enough.
</p>

<p>
	The body is actually being willed into existence by Universal Mind. God's Will made manifest creates every cell in your body.
</p>

<p>
	The body is made out of Infinite Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But none of this will make a lick of sense unless you're in a nondual state of consciousness. So go do some psychedelics or Kriya yoga or whatever.
</p>

	It's not nihilistic survival, it's DIVINE survival! Be careful not to disparage survival too much. Survival is all part of the Grand Design and Beauty of reality.

<p>
	Of course the leadership can change, but Israeli politics has been heavily dominated by Zionists for a long time, just as right now American politics is heavily dominated by nationalists.
</p>

<p>
	It's like blaming America for the Iraq War even though many Americans were against it. But as a national we deserve to be blamed for allowing such things to happen in our name.

Rich people all know each other. All you gotta do is convert one of them and then they will do the work of converting the rest. Similar to how Christianity took over the Roman Empire with the conversion of Emperor Constantine.

It will be less than you think.
</p>

<p>
	Farmers use fertilizer and crop rotation for a reason.
</p>

<p>
	You can't just keep growing plants on a plot of land forever. If only life was so easy.

<p>
	There's some groupthink here, but no it cannot get out of hand because I control it and I have no interest in using it for such purposes. There's not really an organization here, just people posting random stuff.
</p>

<p>
	"The Family" has a deliberate mission to spread their ideology. They are basically doing covert missionary work at a geopolitical level.
</p>

<p>
	Funny enough, I had actually considered a similar plan. What if we took the world's top 500 richest and most powerful people and took them through a full course of 5-MeO-DMT? Giving them legit awakenings. That could transform the entire world overnight. But it could also lead to a lot of devilry so I'm not foolish enough to try that. It's not a good idea to force spirituality on people.

Really, to me, i am an angel, sometimes i try to ask myself, where am i deluding myself, where am i being evil, but no concrete answers come and everything seems hollow. But when i ask about others, tons of answer comes about other's self bias, evilness and on and on.

<p>
	Yes, that's precisely that challenge of evil. Eradicating evil is so hard because one cannot see it in oneself.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone is quick to see the self-biases of others but not oneself. And thus the Greater Jihad degrades into the Lesser Jihad.

<p>
	You must be ruthlessly truthful and objective with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	This is comes at the cost of emotional labor.

			And see, how "the family" took it to a grand level and made it look like a big empire. These shows how one as an individual and collective can take their unconscious and self bias to this gigantic level.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is an important point which needs to be underscored.
</p>

<p>
	The devil does most of his work in a collective. A collective allows for the near total masking of self-bias, since if you manage to surround yourself with 1000 people who share your self-bias, you will look out at the world and it will seem like you have no self-bias because your self-biases are perfectly reflected back at you. This is why people in conformist groups do some really evil shit. The collective absolves them of responsibility. It's like becoming a minnow in a school of fish. No one minnow controls the entire school. They all just go with the flow until they drive themselves off the cliff.
</p>

<p>
	Collective spirituality is a very dangerous game. It's almost guaranteed to be co-opted by the devil.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I don't grow Actualized.org into an actual organization with staff.

<p>
	Yes, you can't conquer the devil through criticism. The devil is conquered through love.
</p>

<p>
	But it is important to expose the devil's machinations to the light of awareness, to bring it into public light. That's a very important function in society that we need more of.
