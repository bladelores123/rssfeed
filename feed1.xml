Standard YangGang points. Nothing new you're telling me.
</p>

<p>
	I've watched his interviews. He says the same stuff every time.
</p>

<p>
	May the best (wo)man win.
</p>

<p>
	I don't doubt that Yang or Bernie would beat Trump. Their biggest hurdle is beating the other Dems.
</p>

<p>
	I think Yang will over-perform in the end but not beat the other Dems. Let's see how it goes. Should be fun to watch. I'm guessing Yang will do well because he feels so authentic.
</p>

	Fun social pics certainly help. But those can be hard to get if you're a loner.

	If you're gonna do online dating invest $500-$1000 in a professional photographer. It makes such a big difference.

<p>
	Not in practice.
</p>

<p>
	I've split tested it. Doesn't matter what you write as long as you got the right profile pics. And if you don't, no amount of writing will help you.
</p>

<p>
	Try it yourself. Create a profile using some random handsome white tall masculine dude's pictures. Write nothing at all. Just say "Hi". Girls will come a flocking. Then try that with your crappy selfies. Crickets...
</p>

<p>
	Some guys have it SO easy online. You just need that classic look. Or very low standards. Of course if you're willing to sleep with absolutely anyone, you can get lucky.

<p>
	That's the beauty of Sanders, he will lead a populist revolution to publicly shame them and shift our entire culture. That's what's really needed. No progressive laws are gonna pass a Republican controlled Senate anyway. Republicans are not going to let Yang do anything and they will demonize him as a socialist.
</p>

<p>
	Meeting them half-way is what we've been doing for the last 40 years. Something new is needed.
</p>

<p>
	Also, your analogy between Malcolm X:Bernie, MLK:Yang is not right. MLK was a radical progressive socialist. So if anything Bernie is like MLK. Malcolm X was a militant ideologue which is not analogous to Bernie. Bernie is leading a progressive social movement just like MLK.

	I have. It's actually possible to zoom in with consciousness to the atomic level. But it's not a visual zoom. It's a consciousness zoom. Since atoms are imaginary anyhow, you don't need to zoom into them visually.

<p>
	Being successful and a leader in your field opens a lot of doors and opportunities.
</p>

<p>
	Once you get really good in your field and people start to know about you, women will naturally come your way. This is mostly because you have become more visible, not because they want your money.
</p>

<p>
	But still, I wouldn't rely on this strategy exclusively. If you're a computer nerd working in your basement 12 hours a day, no women will ever find you no matter how good you are. You gotta start being visible publicly.
</p>

<p>
	The key is being more social. And getting good in your field can help you to increase your socialness.
</p>

<p>
	Why do rockstars get laid every night? Because they are visible to 10,000 people every night. Not because there's anything special about playing music. Although girls love music because it boosts their emotional state, so that does help. Music is like a drug.
</p>

<p>
	Or, you could just increase your socialness by going out every night and being social. Waiting for women to come to you is indirect.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	But I feel he's way too stuck on UBI as his signature policy to the point to being a one-note candidate.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, a candidate has to be evaluated holistically, taking into account every thing, including their experience with politics and government.
</p>

<p>
	Yang's biggest upside, in my mind, is his authenticity. But I don't consider his policies progressive enough.
</p>

<p>
	UBI could easily be dismantled by conservatives in the future and hurt the welfare state.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you're welcome to vote for whoever you like best. I got nothing against Yang. He's a cool guy and if he wins I will vote for him.

</p>

<p>
	Non-existence isn't real, it is imaginary!
</p>

<p>
	There is only existence. Existence is an Absolute and has no opposite.
</p>

<p>
	A non-existent object is actually an existent object in your imagination. But you are misunderstanding that object's true nature. You take it as really non-existent when it is actually existent as a thought. Your mind confuses thoughts and objects. For example, you confuse thoughts of your mother for your mother.
</p>

<p>
	The kicker is, if you didn't create this confusion you couldn't have a mother. Since a mother is a thought, not an object.
</p>

<p>
	So how are you gonna escape this confusion? Escaping it would mean the collapse of your entire reality. Can you stomach that?
</p>

<p>
	We have had decades of inaction.
</p>

<p>
	Sanders is just the kick in the ass we need. Of course he won't be able to pass everything he wants. But he will lead a movement that will shift the overtone window seriously left, which is what we have been lacking for 50 years.
</p>

<p>
	Sanders could be the next FDR. If only he was younger.
</p>

<p>
	Working class people, even Republicans will like Bernie as he pushes against elites.
</p>

<p>
	The ones who hate Bernie are mostly elites.
</p>

<p>
	A working class person is not going to hate Bernie.
</p>

<p>
	FDR was the most popular president of all time. But the elites hated him. I predict a similar sitation if Bernie wins.
</p>

<p>
	Of course hardcore conservatives will demonize him. But they demonized Obama, so there is no pleasing them.
</p>

<p>
	Fox News will demonize no matter who the Democratic president is.
</p>

<p>
	Data seems to show that conservatives benefit from voter suppression, not expansion.
</p>

<p>
	Australia has mandatory voting. Seems to work for them.

<title>How my birth is imaginary?</title>

<p>
	It's very simple: is your birth happening right now? No? Then you are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	If you object, "Yeah, but at one time it really was happening", just notice that you are imagining that too.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot ever escape imagination. If a thing is not being imagined right now, it doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple. You just don't want to accept it because you want things to be "real".
</p>

<p>
	Everything is imaginary, including brains, atoms, planets, science, logic, and your life.
</p>

<p>
	Brains seem to exist from your POV because that is what you're stuck imagining without being aware that you are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness imagines a brain. Your entire paradigm is backwards.

	You don't need to zoom into it. It is already nothing as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Form is nothing. Don't go hunting for nothing. Nothing is everywhere. You are like a fish hunting for water.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, space is not nothing, it is something. But since something is ultimately nothing, space is also nothing.

<p>
	Of course you can't upgrade the level of development of an entire country by several stages in 15 years.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless you guys are making progress. You got to work out those tribal differences and learn the value of pluralistic democracy which tolerates minority rights. Learning that less will take you guys 50-100 years, but you gotta start wherever you're at. It's not like the Saddam situation was sustainable. Eventually he would have died of natural causes, his sons would have been even worse than him, and there would be a bloody revolution to overthrown them. So the US invasion only hastened the inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	Forcing people to vote is still better than no voting at all.
</p>

<p>
	Even in America 50% of people don't vote.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not so bad. Things will get better.
</p>

We have many words for everything, and each one has slight nuances. Nuance is important.
</p>

<p>
	To call Actualized.org religion would be inappropriate. To call it spirituality is more appropriate, although limited.

<title>Online Dating</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Online dating requires above average looks, REALLY good professional profile photos (no selfies), and massive volume.
</p>

<p>
	Online dating requires serious work. You don't just put up a profile and start getting dates. You gotta game it more than real life.
</p>

<p>
	Online girls are screening you almost entirely on looks because they have nothing else to go by. Your personality has no chance to charm them. In real life you can hit much higher outside your league with charm and boldness. This cannot be done online. The girl has to decide whether she will sleep with you purely based on your profile photo in 1 second.
</p>

<p>
	If you're turning online because you're too lazy to do it in real life, chances are your results will be bad. Laziness is not a viable strategy for finding attractive females.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a classically handsome appearance, you can do well online. If not...
</p>

	The thing is, there's much more to reforming government than a single proposal like UBI.
</p>

<p>
	UBI vs jobs guarantee is like 7th on the list of important issues.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful about turning into a single-issue voter. A politician must considered holistically, not on the basis of one cool proposal.

	Religion is just spirituality turned into unquestioned ideology.
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean spirituality is free of dogma or ideology. Just that religion is much, much worse.
</p>

<p>
	Religion is what you call it when spirituality has turned into a cancer of the mind.

<p>
	What you're noticing with your line of questioning is the collapse of the selfish/selfless duality.
</p>

<p>
	You should expect all such dualities to breakdown at the edges when you question them deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	God is the Absolute Unity for all dualities.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot say that God is X because God is also not X, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity is unqualifiable. Anything you say about it is always finite, partial, limited, and in a sense, misleading. Absolute Infinity cannot be fully explicated in finite form. Infinity is by its very nature implicit. It cannot be fully unfolded (because it goes on forever).

	There is software you can install which will block your access to certain websites you select, like YouTube or whatever. You can even set a schedule in this software so that you can access YouTube after work, or on the weekends but not during weekdays.

<p>
	How many times does an dragonfly sleep?

<p>
	There are currently 925,000 species of insects on the planet, and only 20% of insect species have been identified.

<title>Is Bernie Sanders a populist?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/40835-is-bernie-sanders-a-populist/?do=findComment&amp;comment=511215</link>

<p>
	Yes, but the difference is that Sanders is genuinely concerned about little people. Trump is not. Trump is obsessed with materialism and wealth and fame. So he's just an oligarch in populist clothing.
</p>

<p>
	It's not enough to speak populism. You have to walk your talk. You can't be a serious populist if live in a $100 million dollar house and play golf every weekend with millionaires.
</p>

<p>
	A real populist would care about the lowest classes of society. Trump is the opposite of that. He only uses populist language when it suits his rise to the top.
</p>

<p>
	This is a classic tactic. It's called demagogery. Nazis, fascists, and Communists were masters at this.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Funny enough, Bill Gates lives in a $100 million house, yet he still cares about helping poor people. So it's complicated. It is possible to be rich and still care a lot about little people. But it tends to be rare. And Trump certainly isn't that way. What really matters is not your wealth but your level of consciousness and compassion for others. It's no accident that wealthy people often lack compassion because they needed to be ruthless to earn their wealth in the first place. It's very hard to earn a billion dollars without being ruthlessly exploitative.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, any firewall we build will be abusable by future devils. Nevertheless, in practice, a better gov and court system helps to keep the biggest devils at bay.
</p>

<p>
	As an example, slavery is no longer possible in most of the world due to suffciently evolved legal systems. This was not the case 500 years ago. Of course our legal system can still be exploited, but not nearly as badly as it used to be. So there is improvement.

<p>
	You have to ground yourself in the desire for Truth as opposed to meaning.
</p>

<p>
	If Truth is what you most desire, and the Truth turns out to meaningless, you will be satisfied with it because what you really wanted was the Truth, regardless of what it is.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want meaning more than Truth, then you're in trouble because of the Truth happens to be that all meaning is imaginary, you will have to deny it or act upset.
</p>

<p>
	To desire Truth is to want it regardless of what it is. Truth for truth's sake.
</p>

<p>
	Maps come in various degrees of accuracy, with some being totally wrong. But even if you have a very accurate map it is important be conscious that the map is never the territory it depicts.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it's important to understand that "the Earth" is an imagination you are now having.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that there is no Earth in your current direct experience. Which obviously means you must be imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	The floor you're standing or sitting on is not "the Earth".

This individual is my father who is at rock bottom. He doesn't take responsibility for the idea of the trip but has expressed to me that he is willing to take my advice and help seriously. He says that he can't take another month of what his mind is currently doing. He watched something on the news last night about how some people are using Psilocybin to cure depression and anxiety, so something external besides myself is providing him with information within his paradigm. He refuses to help himself, but is continuing to question this. He has asked other people close to us about the experience. He asks them "so what do I do? Do I just sit there? Do I walk around?" <br />
			<br />
			Does this possibly re-contextualize the question for you? If it doesn't, do you know any other approaches I could take that would see quick short term improvements?

<p>
	Yes, that is better.
</p>

<p>
	In which case 1g of mushrooms or 75ug of LSD is a great starting point.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure he's not on SSRI medication.
</p>

<p>
	And explain to him some of the basic theory of how the mind constructs all of reality. He needs to understand that psychedelics are not a hallucination any more than a brick wall is. As he's tripping tell him to contemplate how his mind is constructing reality.

	This dream IS the "by some God's magic"!

	Your life is the process of God coming to know itself.

<p>
	Stop looking for magic elsewhere. The magic is right before your eyes! You are fully immersed in it.

	Otherwise you're just a dabbler. Hard to make any deep impact in the world as a dabbler.

<p>
	I've considered it, but I'm not really interested in interviewing others. I'm mostly interested in sharing deep insights directly with my viewers.
</p>

<p>
	Interviewing people requires a different intent and skillset. I have too much to say.
</p>

<p>
	I'm also not really interested in waiting for someone else to ask me deep questions. I would rather cut to the point.

</p>

<p>
	Do not give psychedelics to random people who are not taking responsibility for the trip.
</p>

<p>
	The person doing the trip should proactively do research and have an intrinsic motivation to trip. They should not be apathetically popping a pill that some random friend gave them.
</p>

<p>
	This is going to create problems. You cannot just assume that he will have a great mystical trip. Many people are not ready for the radical nature of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that you could make his situation worse and you will be blamed for that.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are something you have to really desire to do. You have to have a need for it. You have to proactively seek it out.

	I warned you from day 1 not to turn my teachings into an ideology.
</p>

<p>
	You must use my teachings consciously. How you use them depends on you. Many warnings have been issued.
</p>

<p>
	It would be a good idea to clearly distinguish in your experience what it means to act ideologically and what what it means to act consciously.

	Please don't cite me "spontaneous insight". You have no idea what hell Tolle went through to earn his so-called "spontaneous insight."
</p>

<p>
	He spent 2 YEARS living on a park bench just to integrate it.
</p>

<p>
	Your logic is like saying an Olympic champion got his gold medal in a 30 minute ceremony.

<p>
	Your are splitting hairs now.

<p>
	In practice you will not get insight without time and deep experience.
</p>

<p>
	If this wasn't true, people would not do meditation retreats or become monks.
</p>

<p>
	The core hypocrisy is this: meditation retreats are treated as necessary and important, yet psychedelics are demonized and dissmissed as ineffective.
</p>

<p>
	This is a clear double standard born of self-bias.

<p>
	Or maybe you can do it faster with psychedelics. Who knows?

<p>
	You answered your own question. If both require space between, the space in between cancels itself out.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so hard to take 100 people, split them into 2 groups, and pay each one to do 5,000 of either psychedelics or meditation. And then see who is more conscious in the end.

</p>

<p>
	When you compare psychedelics vs meditation, you're making a biased comparison.
</p>

<p>
	You are comparing 5,000-10,000 hours of mediation with 50-100 hours of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	A true comparison would be to compare 5,000 hours of meditation with 5,000 hours tripping, or 50 hours of mediation with 50 hours of tripping.
</p>

<p>
	It's very misleading to criticize the limited transformative power of psychedelics when you are comparing a few psychedelic trips with a master mediator who's done 10,000 hours of practice.
</p>

<p>
	The true test is to compare apples to apples. Which of course no meditation teacher does. Because of how bad it would look for them. Meditation is terribly inefficient. The only way to overcome its inefficiency is with a full-time professional commitment. And even then, you will not ever be as conscious as with 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that doing 5,000 hours of psychedelics is unheard of in our society. So no one really knows what it would result in. People are too scared or too closedminded to run the test. Because a visionary leader is needed to pioneer a new spiritual path as the Buddha did with Buddhism.
</p>

<p>
	There is a huge difference between following an existing spiritual path like a sheep vs pioneering a brand new one for others to follow.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's what they would say, but their position is incoherent and circular.
</p>

<p>
	What is your behind-the-scenes reality grounded in? You're not questioning that deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot ground reality in the brain because the brain is already part of what you call reality. This is classic question begging.
</p>

<p>
	It's like saying God is true because the Bible says so. And why is the Bible true? Because God wrote it.

	You don't need to go to some alien planet. Animals on Earth already sleep different amouts at different times of the day. Some animals only wake up at night.
</p>

<p>
	Some animals even sleep through the winter.
</p>

<p>
	This has nothing to do with what time is per se. Regardless of what time is you can sleep whenever you want.

<p>
	Reality is groundless. If you try to ground it in anything, like a brain or atoms, you still aren't getting it. Oneness cannot be grounded in anything but itself because oneness can have no other.
</p>

<p>
	Brains have no absolute reality. They are imaginary. Just like all form is.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple, you cannot ground form in another form. That is delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Discover this for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Brains are a relative duality which we use to speak about relative reality. This concept works, but only up to a point. If you examine it deeply enough you will hit upon a self-reference paradox which results in a strange loop. That's your clue that you've reached the limits of that concept of "a brain".
</p>

<p>
	The strange loop is this: if the universe in happening in brain, then where is the brain happening? In the universe? You can't have it both ways. On the one hand you say that the universe comes before a brain, on the other hand you say the whole universe happens in a brain. Which is it? Is the brain itself happening inside a brain?
</p>

<title>Why Psychedelic Awakenings are Insight 'Experiences' and not Permanent Awakenings</title>

There can certainly be a trap in only hitting peaks but not enough sober embodiment.
</p>

<p>
	The peak of a psychedelic like 5-MeO is so extreme it's very hard to embody it even if you meditate all day. You are never going to hit that same level of consciousness sober. You proabably couldn't live regular life while in so much consciousness.

<p>
	Of course he's maximizing love in his twisted way.

<p>
	Devil = God
</p>

<p>
	You guys keep forgetting that final twist.
</p>

<p>
	If you do not understand that Devil = God, you are not properly understanding my teachings. I've been very explicit about that when speaking of devils. That's what makes my teaching different than classical Christian teachings which separate the devil from God, resulting in a duality. My teaching is nondual.
</p>

<p>
	I don't hate Trump. I merely use him as an example because he's the epitome of ego. I understand exactly why Trump must be Trump and that it cannot be otherwise for him. Trump is just a part of my Infinite Self. I would be foolish to hate myself.

	You're thinking about this from behind a computer screen, logically.

	Attraction, when it happens, is not logical, and it is not a conscious choice you make. If enough random guys approached you, you'd fall in love with one of them. It's merely a question of numbers, luck, and how open you are.

			About 20 years ago I met the woman who I knew was the love of my life, but we were both non-single, and I knew the time wasn't right anyways. 5 years later life brought us back into one another's world. Again, we were both dating other people, but both in unsatisfactory relationships. We had an attraction that was so strong and right that we ended up leaving our partners and coming together. Now we are celebrating 10 years of marriage and beautiful children together. It happens. I feel bad about the hearts we hurt, but we are all friends still, so I think we made the best out of a difficult situation.

<p>
	This is simply false. Imagination isn't limited to sense perception. In fact, sense perception is something you're imagining.
</p>

<p>
	Your critique is based on a lot of daulities of which you are unaware. Dualities such as self/other, self/God, self/world, real/unreal, reality/dream, dream/hallucination, reality/hallucination, human/God, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	All of those dualities are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between your childhood happening and it being imaginary. What it means to say that "my childhood really happened" is that you imagine it did. If, right now, you stopped imagining that you were born, you would cease to have a childhood. But you are so attache to the idea of your childhood and having been born that you refuse to acknowledge it is all pure imagination. I don't just mean that your childhood memories might be faulty or exaggerated. I am your childhood even happened other than in your imagination right now! In fact, there is no difference between the two unless you imagine there to be.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference whatsoever between a dream, a hallucination, and your present experience. You just imagine there is.
</p>

<p>
	What you're not understanding is: What you imagine becomes real. Not in some stupid simplistic sense of imagining a unicorn and it landing in your lap, but in the sense that you are constructing all of reality with your mind, the end result of which is precisely what you see before you. Whatever you see is precisely what you are imagining and you are not conscious of how you do this. This process is extremely sophisticated and infinitely complex. If you imagine that you aren't imagining your childhood but that it was real << that's what you're currently imagining, and that's what becomes real for you! You are creating reality by assuming it! You can't see it because this process of imagination is responsible for imagining you. You have a massive conflict of interest problem here. For you to understand what I am saying you would first have to face your own death. Which of course you have zero interest in doing.

<p>
	The larger goal of Actualized.org is a build up a catalog of powerful videos which people can browse from around the world and find every important topic under the sun.
</p>

<p>
	To achieve this goal I need to release lots of videos.
</p>

<p>
	The priority is not the weekly flow but the overall catalog which is built up over time. These videos are not designed to be watched in a linear sequence. This isn't Game Of Thrones. You are meant to look at a giant catalog of 500 topics and click on those which are relevant to you right now.
</p>

<p>
	It should feel like ordering food at the Cheesecake Factory.
</p>

<p>
	If you've never been to the Cheesecake Factory, it's a restaurant with a menu the size of a book. There's so much to choose from you don't know where to start and it all looks so good.
</p>

<p>
	That's the effect I'm shooting for.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to create this effect if I only release 25 videos per year.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I'm not revealing yet what the new course will be about.
</p>

<p>
	But it will be a course that is useful to 100% of people and my viewers, regardless of where you are on your path. It doesn't matter whether you're into spirituality or not at all, this course will be hella useful to you. It doesn't matter whether you've watched a single Actualized video before, or if you've watched them all. But if you've watched them all, this course will help you to implement it.
</p>

<p>
	It will not be about enlightenment or metaphysical topics.
</p>

<p>
	It will not be redundant to the LP course. Both courses will be useful on their own, and also synergize together.
</p>

<p>
	The new course is not "more up-to-date" because it simply covers different/new material. And the material covered in the LP course is timeless. It will still be useful 50 years from now.
</p>

<p>
	If you're following my free videos, you should also supplement them with more practical, less metaphysical teachings from other sources. Actualized's focus is big picture understanding of life, not so much about making you successful. There are tons of sources available for nitty-gritty success techniques and tips. I offer a bit of that, but it's not our main focus here because that ground has already been well-covered by others and because we seek a deeper level of development than success tips can offer.

<p>
	Just the exposure of Trumpism is already raising consciousness as Trumpism looks so ugly to most people that we as a culture will agree that it's not the right path forward. Of course there will always be some fanatics who refuse to change their mind, but mostly people see that Trumpism is not a workable way forward. Even his own supporters are starting to admit it. You can't deny the obvious forever.
</p>

<p>
	All that's necessary is to shine sunlight on devilry and it will start to dissolve. Trump's whole presidency is that process unfolding.

<title>Difference Between Mystical Experience and Hallucination</title>

<p>
	All experience is a hallucination. It's just a matter of what kind of stuff you're hallucinating. The mind can be highly stable or highly unstable and everything in between. Highly stability does not make a hallucination any less a hallucination. It just creates a hallucination of stability and solidity.
</p>

<p>
	A brick wall is you hallucinating something solid and stable. Take a psychedelic and the brick wall will melt and morph. Then it will return back to solidity. Get shot in the head and the brick wall will cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	Classical psychological hallucinations like psychosis are the result of a less stable mind which tends to play by a different set of rules than ordinary minds. It's more dream-like. More like being on a psychedelic 24/7 but often mixed with ego, fear, and confusion. It's not clear like awakening or meditation. Hence people can hallucinate demons and other things like that.

	We will still be covering practical topics in the future. A lot of topics remain related to emotional mastery and those will all be practical.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff on business and success too. Relationships too. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	I just have a big backlog of metaphysical and spiritual topics which I've been executing. It won't always be like that. I'm not going to keep rehashing old topics. There's always new stuff to talk about with at least 200 new topics planned.
</p>

<p>
	There will also be a new paid course, which will be the most practical of all. ETA for that is sometime within the next 5 months.

<p>
	Of course it depends on what my goals are. If what I wanted was a serious relationship and he was actively doing pickup, then probably not. If he is at the point where he's already done a lot of pickup and got it out of his system and was willing to let it go, then that might be ideal. It's every girl's dream to lock down a stud.
</p>

<p>
	Girls hate the guy doing pickup but they love the end-results of pickup if they can lock the guy down at the end of it. Pickup refines the guy and makes him a stronger, more attractive man. Girls love that, but they don't want to know how the sausage was made. They want to assume he's a natural.
</p>

<p>
	It's like, "OMG! You're so good in bed! How did you get this way?"
</p>

<p>
	"Um... you don't wanna know."
</p>

<p>
	Like anything else in life, being attractive requires practice. Highly attractive people tend to have lots of practice.

<p>
	Don't be overly pessimistic. It depends on how you go about it. It's just that conscious relationships are rare and take work. But they can be done.

<title>Bets on Trump going o serve 2nd term</title>

<p>
	Trump's strength is pure illusion. He's like the Wizard of Oz. People keep thinking he's strong because he got lucky and won once.
</p>

<p>
	If you're a betting man, bet on Trump's luck running out. Never bet against karma. It will catch up to him one of these years. He can't keep dodging it forever. What's amazing is how lucky he's been up to this point. But that won't hold up.
</p>

<p>
	In true poetic style he will end up hoisted by his own petard.
</p>

<p>
	It's foolish to bet on a devil prevailing over the truth in the long-run. A devil's victories are always short and fleeting.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to keep in mind that all systems have parasites and exploiters. This is not a condemnation of government per se. It's a fundamental aspect of nature. Parasites have existed for a billion years and will continue to exist for a billion more. This is not a valid excuse to not create better and bigger systems. In fact, this is why better and bigger systems evolve. The better government gets the less parasites will be able to abuse it.
</p>

<p>
	Bigger government is important precisely because its size helps to protect it from large corporate parasites. Government must be larger than the corporations it governs, otherwise things get squirrely.
</p>
