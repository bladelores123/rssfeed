	I've certainly been in a state of consciousness where my parents did not exist. Or, rather, they were recognized to be just figments of my own imagination created to backwards rationalize my Eternal existence.

<p>
	1) Dan Crenshaw's eye is the least funny thing about him. No need to stoop to such lows when we got the stupidity of his ideology to work with.
</p>

<p>
	2) Keep in mind Vaush is still in his late 20's. He's basically a big teen. He will mature a lot over the next 10-20 years. Considering his age he's doing pretty well. When I was his age I was so immature and dumb. Age matters A LOT.

			On a dose of MDMA I saw a big pillar in the middle of the dancefloor at a club clear as day. When I got nearer I saw it was just smoke and my drugged visual perception just interpreted it as a pillar and filled in the gaps until it got more information. So was there a pillar or not?

<p>
	These sorts of perceptional illusions can even happen in normal sober existence. Sometimes you look at a bush or a window and see something like an animal or a face that later you realized wasn't there.

			But still on a pragmatic levelÂ that pillar was de-synchronized from the other minds, so if I pointed at it to show it so someone the person wouldn't validate my experience. Also if I ran into it I would not have been harmed. So there must be a difference on practical level to what we call a hallucination.
		</p>

<p>
	Yes, you define non-hallucination as something you can't stick your hand through.
</p>

<p>
	But the hand itself is a hallucination on a deeper layer.
</p>

<p>
	There are layers to your hallucinations. Hallucinations within hallucinations.
</p>

<p>
	Have you never woken up from a dream only to later realize you are still stuck in a dream?
</p>

<p>
	One time I woke up from a dream 3 times before I finally returned to this dream we call "life".

<p>
	I think it still has a lot of value, but you should supplement it with reading the Spiral Dynamics book chapter on Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	You just need to distinguish a bit more clearly mysticism and nonduality vs Turquoise. They are not the same.

	Crowley is probably more Red/Orange, but combined with mysticism and occult.

<p>
	I think there are many Dems superior to her.
</p>

<p>
	I see her as a bit of a fake progressive. She has pretty deep conservative roots. She frequently sides with the right on certain issues. I don't think she has a deep grasp of things.
</p>

<p>
	I know folks like Jimmy Dore adore her (excuse the pun), but I think Jimmy Dore has lost the plot to the point of hurting the Democratic cause. It's like Dore has gone full-circle into Tucker Carlson. He's way too unreasonable and angry.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, I think Biden is perfect right now. He's the most pragmatic and realistic of the bunch. A rabid progressive would not get much more done than Biden I think. Biden's moderate image is working very well for him. I think people underestimate Biden. He's all too easy to dismiss and mock, yet Biden can accomplish a lot of basic, practical stuff -- as he's currently on track to do. It won't be anything crazy socialist. But it will still be much welcomed. Biden can be trusted to do solid liberal governance. It's not flashy, but it works and it's badly needed and it lays the foundation for future progressive causes.

<title>Can two identical things exist within infinity?</title>

<p>
	If two things were truly identical, you could not distinguish one from the other, and they would literally become 1 thing.
</p>

<p>
	By definition, 2 requires some difference or distinction.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of red, at the least these two reds would have to differ in their x,y,z coordinates.
</p>

<p>
	It should be possible to have some qualities be identical though. Not in all ways, but in partial ways. For example, all protons have the same charge (I would assume).

	This work is not the same for all people. Some people will have it much harder than others. That's okay. Don't be so concerned with where others are at. You can only do better than your old self. That's what matters.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, generally speaking, becoming more conscious is hard. But my point is, don't make it harder than it needs to be. A lot of times you are making it extra hard by doing it wrong. So stay mindful to that. Sometimes you gotta take breaks and sometimes you gotta try doing it the opposite of how you've been doing it.
</p>

<p>
	Take a month off and do nothing. You might be surprised how much you grow from that. Efforting all the time is not really the best way. Ultimately you want to find effortless ways of doing this work. That is the ideal. If it feels too much like work then you're probably doing it wrong.

<p>
	If your goal is to lose weight you need to make permanent changes to your daily diet.
</p>

<p>
	If you forever eliminate the wrong foods from your diet, you will never have to worry about gaining weight ever again. And you don't have to starve.
</p>

<p>
	Cleaning up your diet is THE KEY to permanent and effortless weight loss.
</p>

<p>
	When you start eating healthy food and forever banish junk food, cravings become less of a thing.
</p>

<p>
	Overeating healthy whole food is basically impossible. Eat as much as you like.
</p>

<p>
	But bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, etc is not healthy food. Cut all that shit out. If you want to lose weight, cut out all grains and starches.
</p>

			Isnât it better to actually engage with the arguments, otherwise youâre ceding ground.

Â Thatâs why people like Vaush etc are effective at de-converting right wing gamer brosÂ

<p>
	Is Vaush's debate-lording really that effective? I think he mostly preaches to the choir.
</p>

<p>
	How many Nazi's does Vaush need to debate to prove that Nazism and white nationalism is a dumb idea? And how many of those debates do you need to hear in order to settle this case?
</p>

<p>
	You can engage of course, but also at some point the constant engagement of people with no intellectual integrity or interest in governing is just like arguing with a donkey. It becomes a waste of time. No one should be listening to Dan Crenshaw about how to govern. If you want to have a serious discussion on governing, let's have it. But let's not pretend these Fox News puppets care anything about that.
</p>

<p>
	A precondition for any serious political discussion must be 1) Intellectual integrity, 2) genuine interest in governing, and 3) historical literacy and honesty. Without these 3 things the discussion is a waste of time.

	I want to thank everyone who submitted their application for this job.
</p>

<p>
	In total I received 24 applications. A majority of them very solid and qualified people.
</p>

<p>
	However, I can only select 1. It was a difficult choice, so don't feel bad if I didn't pick you. It doesn't mean there was anything wrong with you or your application. Sometimes these things are just a coin toss when you have a dozen solid candidates.
</p>

	To even take him seriously enough to rebut his logic is already too much of a concession.

<p>
	Such members of congress are simply gifters and morons. Like Matt Gaetz. Nothing they say should be taken seriously. Such people have no intellectual integrity, so trying to reason with them is like wrestling with a pig.

<title>Solipsism has plagued my mind for almost a year! How do I put this demon to rest.</title>

<p>
	The issue of the reality of others is extremely touchy and fundamental because the ego self defines itself relative to "others". Without others there cannot be an ego. So the ego does everything in its power to maintain that construction. The ego cannot admit that it imagined its own mother. This admission would break the ego's reality into pieces.
</p>

<p>
	The true reason you feel that others must exist is because you have fooled yourself into identifying as a finiteÂ biological self. If you think you are human, then of course you feel that other humans must exist. That's inherent to the definition of humans. And of course, as a human your survival is so deeply social that your whole life is pretty much defined by the existence of others. Giving up all those social games is extremely threatening. This is how your mind has your nuts in a vice: socially. Because without success in the social domain you are as good as dead.
</p>

<p>
	People do not appreciate how existentially serious the social domain is. These are matters of life and death. But they are also purely imaginary. This makes for a deeply counter-intuitive mind trap.

			<em><strong>I mean that the Earth is maybe being 'held' by the Consciousness of God whether i perceive it or not.</strong></em> That's how i envision it.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But YOU are God. So if it's not held by you, it's not held at all.
</p>

<p>
	Right now you are holding that some God other than you is holding the Earth. But what you're missing is that it's YOU who's holding that some God is holding the Earth. That's what you're holding! And thus the Earth seems to exist for you as something solid and real beyond your mind. But those are just layers within your mind.
</p>

<p>
	You are assuming there exists someone "other" who can hold things for you. But there are no others, since you are Infinite. "Others" are what you're holding while imagining that they are holding something for you.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is resisting understanding this because you must resist it in order to construct a reality with includes anyone other than you. Your mind is constantly in a process of constructing "others". You are sorta committed to that game. If you ever stop playing that game, all others will literally cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so simple as others not existing. Others exist for you if you imagine they do. But if you stop imagining them, they will all cease to exist. Your core confusion is that you imagine that things can exist outside your imagination. Which is just a pure absurdity since your imagination is Infinite and Absolute.

<p>
	It depends on what you're using your therapist for.
</p>

<p>
	You probably don't need some super advanced therapist for handling basic survival issues.
</p>

<p>
	It gets more problematic when you want to seriously transform yourself. There, an average therapist will probably not have a deep enough grasp of psychology, epistemology, and metaphysics to help you.
</p>

<p>
	Much of what therapy boils down to is just talking stuff out. This can be helpful regardless of level. Just having someone to voice your problems to can be helpful in making you more conscious of the dynamics at play within your own psyche.

<p>
	We could outlaw farming of animals.
</p>

<p>
	But the question is, would that be a net win for the animals? Would the animals prefer that?
</p>

<p>
	My point is, it's not so obvious they would.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, humans kill animals. But humans also give life to animals.

<p>
	You put the demon to rest by realizing that solipsism isn't anything bad and isn't a problem.
</p>

<p>
	There is literally no problem with it. Notice that your mind is manufacturing the problem. So what if you are alone? Enjoy life all the same. And if you can't enjoy life alone, you also can't enjoy it any other way.
</p>

<p>
	Why do you need another being to reflect back to you the beauty of life? Don't you see that this step is extraneous? If life is good then you shouldn't need anyone else to corroborate that for you.
</p>

<p>
	If every human in the world died tomorrow and you were left all alone, life would still be as beautiful as ever. In fact, maybe more so <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	So just bite the bullet and you will see solipsism is nothing bad.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The problem with Psymposia is that they are getting trapped in the Stage Green SJW groupthink. They are a little too eager for social justice, which ends up leading to it's own kind of injustice and distorted perception of reality.

			Leo you're disappointing me. You're talking about veganism like a total newbie who hasn't even contemplated the topic for one second.

<p>
	I am talking about an existential dilemmaÂ which goes way beyond veganism or petty human concerns.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes. But not according to my logic. According to God's logic because in fact slavery exists.
</p>

<p>
	Is owning pets slavery? It owning pets wrong? If you say yes, imagine all the pets who would have never existed if you abolish pet ownership.Â Do you think that's a net win for the pets?
</p>

<p>
	What I'm saying is, from God's POV it is better to suffer than not live at all. Otherwise God would never have created suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Again, I am not trying to argue against veganism here. I think veganism is good. I am trying to point you guys to contemplate a deeper existential issue of life and suffering, so you have a deeper appreciation of the complex tradeoffs involved.
</p>

<p>
	This is not some rationalization for mistreating animals.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so obvious that to not exist is better. Who are you to make this call on behalf of animals?
</p>

<p>
	Obviously since these animals exist, the Universe's intelligence decided it is better that they exist than not.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying factory farming isn't a problem. I am simply pointing out that this issue of life vs suffering is not nearly as simple as you guys think. In fact, I'm willing to bet you never seriously thought about it how counter-intuitive it is.

<p>
	Here's a real mindfuck for ya, if you want some serious food for thought:
</p>

<p>
	Is it better to be born a farm animal, or never be born at all?
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, to end all animal farming is like killing a trillion animals forever.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly people can be born with brain disorders or simply genetic mutations and anomalies.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, none of them are evil.
</p>

<p>
	Snakes can be born with 2 heads. So it's not so surprising that some humans are born with abnormal brains.

	Sorry to say but it seems he's just not that into you and maybe looking for an upgrade.

<p>
	This early into a relationship he should be really into you. He probably just doesn't want to hurt your feelings by telling you you're not the one for him.

<p>
	Game can be directed towards various goals. The goal does not define game. You could do game to find a wife. In fact, many guys are interested in that.
</p>

<p>
	Game is simply learning how to attract women. How you use this skill is up to you. You could use it to become a rapist, or you could use it to start a family.
</p>

<p>
	Practically, to find a good life-long partner requires burning through lots of dates to find the right one. Your first handful of relationships are going to be awful.

<p>
	It may be.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that such health conditions usually have dozens of possible causes, not one. So you need to troubleshoot them all until you find yours. Do not assume there is one universal cause or solution.

<p>
	I'll believe it when I see it.

<p>
	Just because you become more conscious does not mean what you're attracted to changes. The idea that conscious girls are above game is silly. A girl is a girl and they are all fundamentally attracted to the same basic things. As are guys.

	No, she was very interested. Just the usual games and BS. It was not even close to rape.

<p>
	I will provide a simple intro and outro clip that will be the same for all clips.
</p>

<p>
	So basically just clipping my old videos is the job. And titling them.
</p>

<p>
	The trickiest part of this job is simply selecting which portions of a 2hr video are worth clipping. If you can do that, the rest is really easy.
</p>

<p>
	Writing juicy titles also takes some skill, but it can learned.

Do you think that dairy is a big cause of acne in people? I have a lot more acne than other people my age and I ingest a lot of dairy. I also heard in your video on buying healthy food that you had a lot acne too when you ate/drank dairy. So, is dairy a big cause of acne?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	For me dairy does not cause acne, but certain food additives do. I only get acne if I eat out at fast food and other such restaurants. I never get acne if I cook my own food.
</p>

<p>
	But you may be different. If you do a strictÂ elimination diet and cook all your own food you can quickly discover what is the cause of your acne. Acne occurs about 3-6hrs after eating something your body reacts too.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Also, diet is not the only factor. It might be heavy metal toxicity, or the water you drink, or the shampoo you use, or the plastics you consume. So you have to eliminate all those factors as well.
</p>

<p>
	And even then, you might have developed leaky gut, or SIBO, or something else which requires further action to heal.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, eliminating gluten and dairy and junk food should probably be your first move. But that's just the beginning.

<p>
	I'm creating a second Actualized Clips channel which will feature short segments of my long videos. Similar to Joe Rogan's Clips channel.
</p>

<p>
	I'm looking for someone with video editing experience <u>and</u> good sense who can chop up my long videos into elegant 2-8 minutes clips. You gotta understand which juicy parts to clip and which parts not. You also need to be good at coming up with sexy titles for the clips. Not click-bait, but titles that are appealing and generate clicks.
</p>

<p>
	This would be a long-term, part-time job, maybe 7-10 hours per week. We can discuss what is fair payment, I'm not sure yet. You would work remotely and manage your own time. I would manage you very little, mostly just giving you feedback on the quality of your clipping and titling.
</p>

<p>
	My videos are very large at 30-70GB/video. You need to have a good enough internet connection to download many of them per month, and you will also need to upload GB-sized clip files. You will upload finished clips to my server. Also, you must have access to a Windows PC which can handle and render large video files. A dinky laptop is not gonna cut it.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind this is not a full-time job so don't expect this to pay all your bills. Think of this as a gig you do on the side for some extra cash. If you are good at this work it would potentially be a very long-term job. I basically have 100s of old videos that need clipping, plus each new weekly video as long as I keep releasing content.
</p>

<p>
	PM me if you're interested in the work. Include a brief explanation of your relevant experience and why you think you'd be good at this job. Also tell me your age and the city you live in.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks!
</p>

	Her game is playing coy and pretending sex is special.
</p>

<p>
	A girl's game is very sneaky. It's the game of pretending she isn't playing a game. She's so good at it that she perceives it as reality itself.

I mean no matter how busy you are dealing with survival, you can have 30 minutes each day to meditate for example and read some books. Yes you will not become enlightened but doing these things for years will make you more developed than most people out there. The PUA community actually supports meditation and reading books.

<p>
	Of course you can meditate a bit every day. But in practice you will not break through from such pathetically weak practices.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about breaking through via meditation, you need to schedule some 10 day retreats at least, and meditate all day long like a motherfucker.
</p>

<p>
	The PUA community don't know shit about awakening or how to achieve it. Nor do they care. If you follow them you will never awaken. On the other hand, they can get you laid <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	There is definitely a trade-off between sex and awakening. Choose your priorities wisely.

<p>
	Exactly. To be everything one must be nothing. Only nothing is flexible enough to become everything. Like a blank sheet of paper can take any drawings, but a drawn sheet of paper cannot take other drawings. There is an absolute trade-off between drawing one scene vs another scene. You cannot draw a scene of Egypt while also drawing a scene of Japan. Drawing any finite thing precludes the possibility of drawing another finite thing. All form is finite in this way. The only way to escape this limitation is to surrender existence as a form of any kind. Which, God, in its infinite wisdom has done. God surrendered all form to -- paradoxically -- create all possible forms. The only way for God to create everything was to itself be nothing. Which is why God is so hard to find. God is hard to find because it cannot exist as a form -- and since humans are forms, they only care about and look for forms. So humans look around, they don't see God's form, and they conclude that God must not exist. But what they don't realize is that God doesn't have form by design. It's not a bug, it's a feature!

<p>
	In practice, yes. The order of operations is: become skillful atÂ survival, then transcend survival.
</p>

<p>
	For a few exceptionally gifted people this order of operations is not needed, but for most people it is. It is hard to be serious about spiritual work when you are horny and lonely and craving it.

<p>
	Yes, well, if you could understand what I meant you would become enlightened right this second. Ego must prevent you from understanding it. Your life hinges on you not understanding.
</p>

<p>
	I mean that colors and sounds and feelings are happening, but they are not happening to anyone, they are not happening to a human "you". As odd as this sounds, the colors and sounds and feelings that are happening right now are NOT happening to you. They are happening without you. But they are happening. I am not denying colors and sounds and feelings. I am just denying that "you" they seem to happen to.

<p>
	This is explained in great detail in my video: What Is Perception?

Why are humans selective in their love? Why don't they love EVERYTHING equally? Because humans have a self they which to survive. This self is finite, therefore it cannot embrace/Love infinitely. A finite self must have a bias to love some things over other things, because some thing might kill it or harm it.
</p>

<p>
	But God has no self! Since God has no self, it has nothing to defend and nothing to lose. Therefore it can Love absolutely EVERYTHING, because why not? Why not love EVERYTHING? Only if you have a self that is biased. But God is Infinitely Conscious, therefore it cannot sustain the illusion of a finite self, and therefore it simply is LOVE as a pure Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: why would reality as whole not love itself completely? I mean... reality as a whole cannot be harmed by anything because it is everything already, and it cannot be any better than it is because "being better" is a notion only the ego cares about.
</p>

<p>
	Notice this: if you didn't care about getting a survival advantage in life you would not care about one thing more than any other. And if you didn't care about one thing more than any other, you would care about all things equally. But if you care about all things equally, see the beauty of everything, which grow infinite. And so you would fall absolutely in love with EVERYTHING because you don't need it to be different than it is.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that keeps you from falling in love with absolutely EVERYTHING is the ego wanting things to be different.

	You could probably grow them in a tiny storage unit for $30/mo if it's legal in your area I don't see the problem.

	Just be careful that you are not caught and tried as a dealer. Usually if they catch you making drugs, they will try you as a dealer even if it was just for your personal use. They will just assume you will be selling them and that will stick in court. You do not want to get caught as a dealer or drug lab.

	You shouldn't have to abide fools and devils cavorting in your living space.

	Yes, it's annoying to move, but you'll be glad you did. Consider it part of your personal development process. An important part of personal development is setting up your own personal sanctuary at home where no assholes can interrupt you. Don't treat this as unimportant. Your home is important.

	It's more strange-loopy than that.
</p>

<p>
	The brain is not a reducing valve of consciousness, consciousness imagined a reducing valve and called it "a brain".
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is that the brain reduces consciousness not by some material mechanism, but simply you imagining you have one. When you buy the idea that "I have a brain and it produces my consciousness" -- that idea itself reduces your consciousness and THAT is true function of "the brain". The concept of "the brain" is there to ground you in finite consciousness, for without that concept everything would be seen to be as it truly is: infinite <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you were locked in a prison with an open lock, and the only thing keeping you locked in there was your idea that the door was locked! For decades you planned how to break through the lock, and none of your methods worked, until one day you realized there was no lock, and suddenly the door opened.
</p>

<p>
	You ARE the lock and you ARE the key!

<p>
	How else could it be,

<p>
	I never said anything about a rock having a POV. "Having a POV" IS the self! The problem here is not the rock's POV (which you imagine) but that you believe that YOU have a POV! That is the ego illusion. You don't really have a POV, there is Absolute Being, not a POV. Ego imagines the notion of POVs because it needs to feel like it has one. The entire notion of having a POV is wrong.

<p>
	That's a even deeper mindfuck to be had here: Notice that for a chameleon to truly be infinite, it would not only need to be colorless but also formless, thus allowing it to become any other thing. Imagine a chameleon who is such a good chameleon that he had to surrender even his chameleon identity because he needed to in order to mimic a rock, or a bird, or a human. But in this case, if the chameleon really became so strong and good at his function, he would no longer be merely "mimicking" those objects, he would literally BE those objects.
</p>

<p>
	So a true Chameleon cannot even be a chameleon. He must be a non-chameleon Chameleon <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	And if you understand that, then you understand why God must have no identity: precisely so he would take every identity fully, without mimickery. See? God can't just pretend to be rock or a bird or a human, God has to actually BECOME those things, otherwise how would they come into existence?

			Question thoughâdoes Love address the âwhyâ component of Godâs fragmentation? Aka why does God fragment itself into finite perspectives. Like, God delights in realizing itself as infinityÂ by first limiting itself. Or is it more just the fact that limitation is intrinsic to infinity, so it could be no other way?
		</p>

		<p>
			Hopefully that makes sense
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The why is more radical than you think.
</p>

<p>
	God IS Love. Love is Truth. Love is Absolute. Therefore literally nothing but LOVE can ever exist. So if a thing exists, it's ultimate cause is always simply LOVE. Reality is LOVE, and LOVE is EVERYTHING, and God is EVERYTHING. Therefore all the finite stuff is just literally what God is. The end.

<p>
	If Sherlock Holmes ate some mushrooms or hit himself in the head with a hammer, he would experience some odd subjective experiences. And he would consider it a demonstration of causality.
</p>

<p>
	But is it really? All of that "causality" is occurring within an imaginary dimension. The true cause of Sherlock Holmes' odd subjective experiences is not the mushroom or the hammer or his brain, it's the author who imagined him and his entire universe -- of which Sherlock is totally clueless because the author exists outside the plane of his reality.

<p>
	Peter Ralston in particular has made some incredible contributions to mankind's understanding of itself, but virtually nobody recognizes it. He really deserves to be as well-known as Einstein. But, alas, that will never be the case.
</p>

<p>
	Being well-known is largely a marketing game. It has little to do with the depth of one's work.

<p>
	You should chase living an authentic life aligned with your top values, your top passions, helping spread truth, consciousness, love, and beauty across the Universe via which ever way most excites you and suits your unique strengths and talents.
</p>

<p>
	You are right that you should not just sit around twiddling your thumbs. You should be constantly working on your life purpose and evolving yourself towards that end.
</p>

<p>
	Life is short. Don't squander it sitting around in confusion and inaction.
</p>

<p>
	False success is chasing what others tell you is good.
</p>

<p>
	True success is devoting your life to expressing the Love that you have for the world in your unique way, and doing so skillfully and eagerly.
</p>

<p>
	False success will not make you happy, but true success will.

<p>
	Think of it like this: a TV screen has no persona until it displays some persona played by an actor in a movie. It would be silly to suggest that the TV has the person it is displaying, or some other persona, because the TV can display infinite personas. The only way the TV can display infinite personas is precisely because its "true persona" is null.
</p>

<p>
	That's how God is. God cannot have a self because God imagines all possible selves and non-selves alike.
</p>

<p>
	A chameleon who can change all of his colors has no color. He is -- paradoxically -- colorless. A colorless chameleon is an infinite chameleon. Colorless = Infinite Colors. No-self = Infinite Self.

			Leo , how to get a girlfriend if I am constantly friendzoned with every girl I meet ?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The only reason you get friendzoned is that you are not communicating with these women from the start with sexual intent. You must change the attitude and style of your conversations to being man-woman -- sexually charged.
</p>

<p>
	That does not mean you have to say anything sexual. But just by the way you look at her she should feel that if she ever gets alone in a room with you, you will rip off her panties and nail her ass to the wall. Nothing needs to be said. It's your attitude. Look at her like you are a hungry wolf and she is a rabbit. She will feel that and you will never get friend-zoned again. You may get rejected however. But rejection is good, it means she feels your intent and it's just not the right match.
</p>

<p>
	You need to project your masculine intent more. Don't hold it back. If you get turned on by a woman, let her feel it rather than hiding it from her. Your being turned on will turn her on. This is a huge part of learning game. You stop apologizing and hiding your sexual attraction.

It is something that I have been debating for a long time, I just can't understand, how important reality is in the end. If I finally make the realization (i already know this, but i have not felt it) that I am god, I am conciousness, then it sort of eliminates the need for sex and relationships, doesn't it? Other part of me wants to just spread joy, love and enjoy this dream together with someone else, who also understand atleast spirituality in-general.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, God does not elminate the need for sex or relationships. You will be as horny as you always were after awakening. And you will still probably want to relate with people in intimate ways.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with seeking intimacy. Go for it. Awakening will not solve this part of your life.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, getting rid of dating insecurity, learning to lead, and getting in touch with your masculine edge is all very important for a man. You can't really live a good life without it. The pursuit of women makes men stronger men. Which is a good thing. In the same way that a lion who cannot hunt is a pathetic animal.

<p>
	It doesn't have to be. But if it wasn't convincing you would no longer call it "reality". It would be a fluid and wacky as your nightly dreams.
</p>

<p>
	The anchors are needed IF you want things to feel "real" and solid.
</p>

<p>
	Just notice how you'd feel if you no longer used the notions of an Earth or brains to explain your daily experience. Notice how it would feel to not have any anchors.

	Yes, I felt a bit better for about a week, but it didn't address any of my real issues and in some ways misled me. It took me months to recognize the misdirection.

<p>
	The biggest problem with these kind of therapies is not the lost money, that's peanuts, it's the misdirection and false understanding they give you of your problems.

<p>
	Sounds excessive unless you got some serious medical condition that needs tracking. And even then it would be wiser to do specific narrow tests for your condition.
</p>

<p>
	Cortisol needs to be measured using a saliva test home test kit, not blood work.

<p>
	Diet seems to be the most important factor. You probably have autoimmunity due to diet or toxins that you consume or are already lodged in your body. So you need to do serious elimination dieting to discover which foods your body tolerates, and you need to do some serious detoxing of heavy metals, plastics, pesticides, etc. -- and of course eliminate them as much as possible from your diet.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do a serious elimination diet, 100% carnivore can be a good options for 30 days. That allows you eliminate all plant food, which tends to cause autoimmunity. Or fasting. But fasting for long term is very hard and will introduce other problems so it will be hard to tell how you feel.

	You can easily set up daily auto backups of your drives/files to a usb drive or network driveÂ with a software like GoodSync.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I store my main commonplace book for the book I am writing on a tiny usb drive, which I can plug into any computer or laptop, and all my machines do daily auto backup to a network drive.
</p>

<p>
	GoodSync could also upload your files daily via FTP to a web host or server of your choice or DropBox.

When your numbers are so lowÂ you will constantly be frustrated because the reality is that this is a numbers games. If you hit on 5 girls a year, chances are that none of them will pan out no matter how good you are.Â If you hit on 1000 girls per year, now you'll get some results.
</p>

<p>
	Talk to more girls. Don't expect any one of them to pan out. Don't focus on attracting any one girl -- that's just a recipe for misery. Girls will be extremely fickle and flakey until they sleep with you. So the trick is to hit on lots of girls and don't hold your breath for anyone particular one to sleep with you. Majority of them won't.
</p>

<p>
	It's just like sales. It is foolish to hinge your entire business on one customer. Your business should be structured such that you are so busy no particular customer matters. You shouldn't need any customer's business and you should be willing to lose it without a hint of threat to your business.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is that when you structure your business this way, more people will want to buy from you. And more girls will want to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	That's creating abundance vs being stuck in scarcity. It's counter-intuitive and girls will tell you they don't want that. But practice they love it because it os am honest signal of a high value guy. A high value guy has lots of options and girls can smell it and they LOVE the smell even though they will deny it if explicitly asked about it.

<p>
	This is shadow work 101.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the child's mistake (now that's he's an adult) is to disown the fact that being abusive is not just a thing "others" do, but that he is also capable of it. By realizing that being abusive is also a part of him, he can integrate it and heal. Otherwise he will forever be resentful because he feels that abuse should not have happened to him because he would never do such a thing himself. But the truth is that he would do such a thing himself if he was placed in that situation.
</p>

<p>
	At an even deeper level he can become conscious that all the abuse that exists in the Universe is literally his own self.
</p>

<p>
	With deep enough consciousness you will realize that whoever abused you, was actually your own self! So you abused yourself. And when you realize that, you can forgive yourself, accept yourself, and heal.
</p>

<p>
	Try to fathom this: you literally ARE every rapist in the world who has ever lived. Rape is not something some "other" "bad guys" do. Rape itself is construction of your own Universal Mind. When you realize this, you stop disowning rape, and you accept yourself as a rapist (even if your human body has never raped anyone). It doesn't matter what your human avatar did or didn't do. Once you realize you are the whole Universe, anything that occurs in the Universe is part of you. Since your true identity is Infinity, that means you are a rapist.
</p>

<p>
	If you are God, and God is Everything, then God is rape, and you are rape.

</p>

<p>
	But should you swallow it, you will become Whole.
</p>

<p>
	What parts of yourself are you disowning? Hint: everything that you consider "not-me".

</p>

<p>
	The simple fact is that mankind will not take climate issues seriously until they feel the burn of it personally. So we wait for that to happen. Suffering is the greatest teacher.

<p>
	If you want to do a critique of my work, go ahead. But actually do it. Don't do this pathetic "he's a cult leader" stuff. Actually state which of the things I say are false and why. The way you say "cult" shows that you don't even know what a cult is or how cult leaders operate. Maybe actually read some books about it on my book list, or watch my Cult Psychology videos.
</p>

<p>
	If I am so wrong, then the things I say should be very easy for you to deconstruct. If you were serious about truth-seeking you would not be here using ad hominem smears.
</p>

<p>
	This work has nothing to do with me. It does not hinge on me personally nor should anything I say be taken as a belief -- which I have repeatedly told you guys from day 1. If you cannot personally verify something I say, then it is not true.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that the world and life and society are not coming to any end. Not even close. A lot of Green folks portray climate change as if that were the case. Which is a frame that is both false and makes people depressed.
</p>

<p>
	Will some animals and humans get hurt in the process due to climate change. Absolutely. And that has always been the case with human evolution. How many buffalo were hurt in the conquest of America? How many natives?

	Sure, but there are millions of species, and new ecosystems will form, and even new species will arise.

<p>

<p>
	Ecosystems can be rebuilt. Species can even be reverse engineered.

	Remember, 99% of species eventually die out. The whole Earth is evolving and manmade climate change is plan of that evolution. Mankind is not some "unnatural" force.

	A 2 degree rise in climate is not the end of anything. The EarthÂ has been much hotterÂ than that before and life goes on.
</p>

<p>
	Environmental people are too close to the problem to see it in the grand scheme of things. They are stuck in a sort of mid-term thinking which leads to depression. You gotta take longer view. In the long view mankind will terraform the Earth to the perfect temperature.
</p>

<p>
	Listening to scientists without doing your own big picture thinking about their data is the trap here. Scientists are not big picture thinkers. They just robotically spew out data without any consideration of mankind's evolution.

	This is not to say we should not take action of climate change and polution. We should. And we are. But it's gonna take time, so be patient. You can't turn an oil tanker on a dime.

<p>
	The systemic breakdown is not so massive in the grande scheme of human affairs.

<p>
	Ecological collapse is reversible.

<p>
	Be careful, you are over-generalizing and this will lead to you not properly understanding conservativism.
</p>

<p>
	This was just a silly example. It is not a deep understanding of conserativism.

<p>
	If your worldview leads you to fear and depression, then obviously something is wrong with your worldview -- NOT with the world!
</p>

<p>
	The point of this work is to cut through the BS that is fear and depression. If this work is not making your happier, lighter, and more playful , you need to change your understanding of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Being fearful, frustrated, and sad is not a conscious or truthful state and it is not how we heal the world.

<p>
	Ego is a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Ego sits much deeper than thoughts, beliefs, or feelings. Which is why the ego doesn't go away simply if you stop thinking for a while.

<p>
	There are dozens of possible causes so there cannot be one solution. You must track down your root cause.
</p>

<p>
	For me, diet plays a big role. Some foods make it much worse, others much better.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely get an in-depth check up of your thyroid. It's a big factor.

<p>
	This is false. Fiber must be avoided at all costs as it feeds the SIBO, and SIBO inflames the gut, making it more leaky.

			Do you think itâs best to just go with the diet I feel best on? For my case it would be keto, but with people saying itâs a disaster long term, Iâm lost. Like do I go on a non-keto diet that I feel worse on relative to a keto diet, just toÂ <em>hopefullyÂ </em>save my long term health?

</blockquote>

<p>
	Just because it feels good doesn't make it healthy long-term.
</p>

<p>
	Do keto for now, fix your issues, then you can expand to healthier diets. You gotta find which plant foods you're sensitive too and avoid those while eating the good stuff you're not sensitive to.
