Form is infinite and DMT is just more form. Vista is form. Amazing form is still form.

<p>
	Explanation of Infinity is impossible! That's what you're not understanding.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot explain reality because reality is prior to explanation.
</p>

<p>
	Any attempt to explain reality is incomplete and ultimately wrong.
</p>

<p>
	God cannot explain itself to itself because it is itself.

	I think you're being too picky. Anna is doing a decent job overall. Gotta give people some leeway or it turns into a circular firing squad.

<p>
	If you are progressive she's on your team. Sure, you can find things to criticize about her. But is this really a good use of your time?

	Dude, if TYT is not progressive enough for you, you're shit out of luck in this life.
</p>

<p>
	Few people speak out against corruption as much as TYT.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you fight corruption doesn't mean you have to be a rabid dog about it. You can still be polite and respectful. Society has certain norms and standards which are wise to observe simply from a practical point.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you have a gripe with Albright doesn't mean everyone else must too.
</p>

<p>
	There are lots of ways to hold devils accountable. Don't expect people to do it your way. They will do their own way. If you want things done your way, you do it. Go interview Albright and call her a devil to her face. Let's see how far you get.
</p>

<p>
	That's precisely wrong. Right and wrong are FAR more socially constructed than anger or blueness. Which is obvious if you notice that no two humans agree on what is right and wrong, good or bad.
</p>

<p>
	To realize the relativity of good & bad does not even require awakening. It's a lot more obvious than that. A child can understand it using a bit of logic.

<p>
	The brain is part of your mind. Mind interacts with mind.
</p>

<p>
	With deep awakening, you will realize that your mind was never happening in the brain, your brain was happening in your mind. And then the brain part of your mind will simply shut off, like it never existed. Then you will be free of the illusion of physicality. You will become non-physical and immortal.

	I am very sensitive too. This is a huge plus. Saves you on wasted chems and takes your trips deeper.
</p>

<p>
	There is really no point talking about it. Do 100 trips and see what happens. A few trips is nothing. Contemplate in your trips. Don't get lost in chasing forms but rather focus on nondual insight and purification.

From the relative perspective there would be consequences you'd have to deal with.
</p>

<p>
	Your actions have natural consequences. So long as you accept those, nothing is wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but what's wrong with not telling the truth? That's a freedom you have. Tricking people is part of how life keeps on living.
</p>

<p>
	There exists no one in reality who can determine whether lying is wrong, other than you. So if you believe it is wrong, it is wrong, for you, because you imagine it to be so. But don't expect others to necessarily agree.

	What way would life have to be designed for you to say, "This life isn't real."?
</p>

<p>
	Can't you see that no matter how it was designed, since you have nothing else to compare it to, it can't seem anything but real for you.
</p>

<p>
	Consider this: if you were Mickey Mouse in a cartoon world, and you'd never experienced anything but that world, you'd think that it is real. You'd have no choice. It would be your baseline for everything. And what's more, if you ever got a glimpse of human life you'd say, "That's so unreal! Those humans are so limited."

<title>Hypocrisy of having no morality</title>

<p>
	The point is, right and wrong are relative notions.
</p>

<p>
	There is no absolute right and wrong. But in the relative world -- relative to living a decent human life -- you should not kill people, because it will not end well for you. But again, this is all relative. If you want things to go badly for you as a human, by all means, go for it. You will either end up in jail or killed by the police. Maybe if you're extremely lucky you can get away with it, OJ style. But even then, you'll still live a miserable life. Don't forget, OJ still served 10 years in prison thanks to his criminality.
</p>

<p>
	This is where Understanding Relativism comes in. Watch that video and contemplate it deeply until you understand what relativity means.

<p>
	Blue Beings and whatnot do not contradict Self-Love, and since any kind of being is a form, it is still a subtle form of duality.
</p>

<p>
	I didn't say things "stop" at Self-Love. Self-Love is infinite. It's all that is. You can keep exploring the world of form forever. No matter what new forms you discover, it will all just be facets of your Self.
</p>

<p>
	So there's no real contradiction here. Just people talking about different facets and forms in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	There may be all sorts of beings in the universe. So what? None of it threatens or undermines nonduality.
</p>

			And at this point I am not sure if it was my mind playing games on me but basically what happened was I was shown “nothing”. And as I started to go there / allowing the experience of nothingness, a thought came up basically saying that if I chose to experience nothingness it would mean that I could never return. Because from nothingness, there is no way back. There is no way, no ego, no universe, no awareness, not even unawareness. Just nothing.
		</p>

		<p>
			So in that moment I convinced myself that if I decided to experience nothingness, the universe would just sort of collapse and everything would cease to exist. Obviously that sounds funny right now but that’s what it felt like in that moment.
		</p>

		<p>
			Later during the trip, I noticed that maybe two seemingly opposing truths can exist at the same time and that there is no way to grasp that using a “three dimensional” or linear way of thinking about it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe there are certain levels of truths.
		</p>

		<p>
			It appeared to me that yes, maybe “I am everything.” is an objective truth but that “I am.” is an even deeper truth. And therefore nothingness and “something” can happen without excluding the other.
		</p>

		<p>
			It also made me think about quantum mechanics (and I do not know a lot about this topic), that prior to being observed, a quantum system is not in any particular state. It’s in a superposition state that contains all the possible states at once. So first, it just “is”. Then it “is something” (when being observed).
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, this is precisely correct.
</p>

<p>
	Although there is an even deeper level where you realize that something and nothing are identical and there is nowhere else to go. You can't choose to experience Nothing because you're already experiencing Nothing all the time regardless of whatever you're experiencing or not-experiencing.
</p>

<p>
	That Nothing you encountered was The Void, The Godhead, Mu, or your Original Face as the Zen folks call it.
</p>

<p>
	There are of course much deeper levels of nonduality and more facets you can access with practice.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful taking such large doses and mixing substances. Lower your dose to 125ug of LSD and learn to contemplate.
</p>

			So what I'm gathering from everybody here is that my thoughts took control and led the trip into a spiral, i.e. I felt resistance and I thought fear, so my mind conjured up fearful images and thoughts that altered the course of the trip. Because at the start of it, I felt a little overwhelmed, but I wasn't necessarily in fear, just in awe of discovering what was a massive truth of reality that I had not yet experienced, and it slowly changed into a lot more morbid visions. Is this a good indication that there's a lot of shadow work that I need to do, that perhaps there are much underlying, deeply subconscious thoughts that I've not come to face until now? Or is it that I've not yet gotten to a point where I'm able to let go of my ego in order to objectively experience a trip? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It wasn't even fear per se. Your mind just happened to drift off into images of blood and you did nothing to change it so it just got stuck in an echochamber of bloodly imagery. Then you got scared because what you imagined started to materialize before you and you were confused about how this was possible. You were terrified by the power of your own imagination and it didn't even occur to you to control it.
</p>

<p>
	This is all normal. You must learn that your imagination is very powerful, so be careful how you use it, or how you let it use you.
</p>

<p>
	You can avoid such trippy detours by giving your trips a strong intention. Guide your mind towards what you wish you contemplate so your trip isn't just a random dream.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to not get lost in the content of one's trips but rather to focua on going meta, contemplating the strucuture of consciousness. What I have been describing here is strucuture while your bloody stuff was content.
</p>

	Yes, practical teachings are still important. It's not enough to literally only have one teaching. The devil is in the details. People need help with implementation of high-level abstractions like Self-Love.

	To be fair, 5-MeO-DMT has a fairly high bodyload and can also cause nausea. A few times I came close to vomiting but what saved me was having a totally empty stomach.

<p>
	Simply no. Love is not that.
</p>

<p>
	It would help if you realized your brain is imaginary. And so is science.
</p>

<p>
	You CANNOT treat science as an absolute. Science itself is obviously incomplete and always growing. Stop blindly believing it. Question it deeply.

<p>
	It's easily explained. Since you are God, your mind constructs/imagines all of reality. The psychedelic expands your consciousness and will power such that whatever you start to imagine starts to physically manifest. If your mind starts imagining blood, you start to see blood. There is no limit to what you can imagine. This can lead to some freaky trips, especially if you have a poorly disciplined or impure mind.

	Well, climate change is gonna make immigration problems 100x worse. And of course those who deny climate change will spin all this as the fault of the immigrants and embrace nationalism even more. It's coming. That's the tragedy of sticking one's head in the sand.
</p>

<p>
	What's denied by nationalists is that rampant capitalism causes and exacerbates immigration problems. Global warming, exploitation of 3rd world countries by corporations, wars started by the military-industrial complex, etc all contributes to people being  dislocated.
</p>

<p>
	After a few hundred years, capitalism starts to cannibalize itself and spin out of orbit.

	The same chemicals affect people differently. Also, people have different levels of trauma, shadow, and karma to purify.

<p>
	If you've lived an evil life full of lies, yeah, a psychedelic might cause you to vomit simply from self-disgust.

	All immigration and refugee issues are part of globalization. As the world gets more interconnected people move around more, destablizing old ethnic boundaries and identities. If this went on long enough all the races would blend into one.

	Make sure you don't undersell your progress. It's easy to forget how much we grow, especially if we grew a lot.
</p>

<p>
	It's good to remind yourself once in a while how unconscious you used to be.

<p>
	It's all relative.
</p>

<p>
	Doing it is better than not doing anything at all. But it's better to be your own shaman if you can manage that.
</p>

<p>
	What matters is the substance, not the shaman. The shaman is a middleman. Why do you want a middleman between you and God?

	Cenk the one of the biggest leaders in passing a constitutional amendment to get money out of politics. This is the #1 issue. He needs all the support he can get. Nothing else is as important. Even Bernie is not as good on this issue as Cenk. He founded Wolf-Pac.
</p>

<p>

	Anything should be smokable if you use the right technique. The trick is not burning it. Sandwhiching it between neutral mullein leaves is probably your best chance.

	Are there dangers to awakening kundalini? Sure. Do your research before doing it.

	The ultimate solution is to realize that your identity extends to encompass the entire Universe, which of course includes your rapist and any others who harmed you. To realize that all that is YOU! And that you are Love.

	Mystical experiences have a profound healing power unlike anything which you can accomplish through the ordinary state of mind, reading books, listening to experts, or doing techniques. You need to access a level of love deeper than your trauma. The deeper the trauma, the deeper the required love to heal it.
</p>

<p>
	Confronting the person is not necessary once you confront your SELF.
</p>

<p>
	Once you access Divine Love, you will have a powerful capacity for compassion and mercy, which you will use to understand and forgive your abuser.
</p>

	Your question assumes unfoldment across time, a process, and a difference between folded and unfolded. These are still subtle dualities which must be transcended.
</p>

<p>
	From the highest level, everything happens at once and eternally.

<p>
	This would be easy if everyone agreed on what "bad" is. But bad is relative and there are many competing interests in this game. What's bad for you might be great for me, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	So which way should we move? Who gets to say?

<p>
	It's a good question.
</p>

<p>
	Conservative values have importance, such as: courage, independence, hard work, commitment, discipline, faith, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you don't skip over stage Blue. That's basically what Jordan Peterson's redeaming message is.

<p>
	Make sure you appreciate the value of regulation. Otherwise you might end up raped.

<p>
	It's fun to talk about no regulations until you realize that means someone will manipulate the whole thing against you. There are a lot of selfish devils around.

<p>
	Some monks do such hardcore visualization practice that they can transfrom "physical" things. The more conscious you become the more powerful your will becomes.

	Be very suspicious when your mind supplies "he's a psychopath" as an explanation for anything.

<p>
	Selfishly pursuing survival is not psychopathy, it's standard operating procedure for all organisms. Just because you find it offensive doesn't make it psychopathy.

	There are many Silicon Valley types who like to pretend they are Green when really they are ORANGE-green because they are caught up in chasing money, success, fame, sex, etc.
</p>

<p>
	ORANGE-green is the dominant cultural norm right now in big cities.
</p>

<p>
	It's the difference between neo-liberals and serious progressives. The difference between someone like Bill Clinton and Bernie or AOC.

<p>
	Creating a just and fair society is very, very complicated and challenging. Which is precisely why it hasn't yet been done. If the solutions were easy it would have been done 1000 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	We've been trying for over 10,000 years and still no one has figured out how to do it at the scale of 100s of millions of people.
</p>

<p>
	But we have gotten a lot better. It's an evolutionary process.

<p>
	It is not government resistant at all. Government now regulates most of the exchanges and access points, and government is fully capable of tracking your BitCoin transactions through the public blockchain. So watch out.
</p>

<p>
	Governments are never going to allow an unregulated currency. They will regulate all the access points to it.

<p>
	Like all technology it can be used for good or for evil, depending on the level of consciousness of the user.
</p>

<p>
	Technology itself is always just a mechanical thing. What matters is the intent of the user.
</p>

<p>
	Of course powerful technologies must always be regulated because devils will want to abuse it.
</p>

<p>
	There is a lot of potential for abuse within BitCoin. Which is why devils gravitate towards it.
</p>

<p>
	No crypto currency will ever be allowed to go unregulated because it would be too dangerous to society. There are good reasons that banks and large transactions are regulated. Too many people would otherwise get exploited.

<p>
	No it won't. You're exaggerating things.

<p>
	Worse case scenario just move to another town and change your number.

<p>
	You can always pay him back in the future and make things right.
</p>

<p>
	There is no value in killing yourself. You will make so much money over your whole lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	You can even write him a heart-felt letter explaining your situation and why you had to leave town.

<p>
	Well, your view is one-dimensional and naive.
</p>

<p>
	Distributing value that people did not earn is itself theft.
</p>

<p>
	People own their labor, but not all people labor equally nor produce equal results.
</p>

<p>
	If you work hard to create something of significant creative value, you will understand why some low-level grunt should not own half of your life's work.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with taking the socialist ideology too far. And it is an ideology. It's not something you've careful deduced yourself from years of personal experience.
</p>

<p>
	Labor is not merely a matter of hours spent. Labor has to be genuinely creative and value-generating. So you can own your labor but if your labor is licking stamps, you don't deserve much compensation for that. Labor is highly unequal. Some labor is worth 1000x more than other labor.

<p>
	Be careful judging your results so directly.
</p>

<p>
	The opposite might easily be the case. As kundalini activates you can get crazy monkey mind as the body/mind purifies itself. You must endure such things if you want serious results.
</p>

<p>
	Peace of mind is a byproduct of deep purification. The purification process itself can be uncomfortable and agitated. That's actually a sign that it's working, not a sign of failure.

<p>
	This is very foolish. Just face the person and try to make things right. You will feel much better. To hinge your life on money is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	What's imaginary is your fear about money and facing this person.
</p>

<p>
	No enlightened truths are relevant for you because none of them are part of your direct experience. Enlightened truths only help you if you are conscious of them, and clearly you are not. By killing yourself you will put yourself through hell because you are not conscious enough to understand what you're doing.

<p>
	It felt gentle because you did a tiny dose of DPT.
</p>

<p>
	20mg of 5-MeO-DMT is equivalent to maybe 70mg of DPT.
</p>

<p>
	25mg of DPT is nothing. It should barely be felt at this dose.
</p>

<p>
	This all assumes plugged or snored, not smoked.

<p>
	Don't fall asleep during your trips. That's a waste of a trip.

<p>
	That's not going to work.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of a relationship is to <u>grow together</u>. As soon as that stops working you're doomed.
</p>

<p>
	For a stable long-term relationship you must find a partner who is willing to grow with you. Otherwise why even be in relationship?
</p>

<p>
	Do not underestimate the seriousness of a value disconnect in a relationship. You are going to be able to ignore that and just keep things going. The value disconnect will infect everything eventually.

	If the horror can be embraced, love becomes that much stronger.

<p>
	How weak would love be if it could not embrace horror? That is not true Love. Love can handle it all. Which makes it the ace card.

	You can find such a service but you should expect to spend more than $100. One session is not gonna be enough.

	If you value spirituality, you shouldn't be cheap with it. These people work hard so they deserve compensation.
