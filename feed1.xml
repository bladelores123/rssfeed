<p>
	Toxic ideologies will have to arise from the diverse pool of ideas and they will have to be disprove in the court of public consensus by living through their disastrous consequences.
</p>

<p>
	Human culture learns by suffering the consequences.
</p>

<p>
	For culture to learn that, for example, libertarianism is a toxic and unworkable ideology, it has to be tried and seen to face-plant by hundreds of millions of people.
</p>

<p>
	We learn by fucking up and feeling the pain.
</p>

<p>
	Right now we are learning that the alt-right worldview is shit. Trump is teaching us that.
</p>

<p>
	Society is a self-correcting mechanism driven by pain and suffering. When the suffering gets high enough, people learn.
</p>

<p>
	I think the best sales tactic is: corporate corruption
</p>

<p>
	A Bernie-like candidate needs to arise who's entire message is just this: "Corruption! Corruption! Corruption! Our government doesn't work well because money is corrupting the whole system and nothing else matters. All the culture war stuff is just a distraction from corruption. What you really want is not right-wing government or a left-wing government but a competent government that isn't corrupted by money or corporations or lobbyists."
</p>

<p>
	This is the strongest, unifying message.
</p>

<p>
	The slogans should be:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Corruption! Corruption! Corruption!
	</li>
	<li>
		End money in politics, end lobbying.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	What we need is severe regulations on corporate power and capitalist exploitation of the political system. That's the key issue. Everything else hinges on that. Right now the government is crippled by selfish corporate lobbying. If we can reform that, we can then create a quality social safety net and Green infrastructure.

<p>
	Climate change is already here and it's already restructuring society.
</p>

<p>
	Solid Green has been trying to emerge for the last 10 years but it's constantly being demonized and under attack by Blue & Orange. And this attack will continue for at least another 10 or 20 years until the situation becomes so catastrophic that Blue and Orange will be forced to admit the necessity of Green. But much damage will already be done by then. Hundreds of thousands of people will already be dead due to this attack on Green.

<p>
	It's all answered here:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.actualized.org/insights/deconstructing-denial-of-systemic-racism" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/insights/deconstructing-denial-of-systemic-racism</a>
</p>

<p>
	You can still have systemic racism in a non-capitalist system. But addressing income inequality is fundamental to get blacks on par with whites due to a massive historical wealth gap.
</p>

<p>
	The benefit of tackling the capitalism problem is that it will help all middle class people regardless of race or identity, and we need to tackle capitalism no matter what. There is no possible future in which our current neoliberal capitalist system survives unreformed. Its reform is mandatory for a healthy democracy. So we'd be killing two birds with one stone.

<p>
	The problem is that while everyone is railing against Green, the reality is that Green has only just begun and we don't have anywhere near enough solid Green. People are yelling and kicking about Green when Green has yet to take power.
</p>

<p>
	The only way forward is to dismantle the corrupt corporate neoliberal capitalist plutocracy, and that can only happen at solid Green, and it still decades away from being actualized.
</p>

<p>
	All those people complaining about Green are just useful idiots for the corporate plutocracy. While they complain about cancel culture and SJW's, corporate plutocrats are sucking up all the country's wealth and killing the environment in a way which will be catastrophic.
</p>

<p>
	The name of the game is distraction. People get lost in cultural issues while neglecting the real issue, which is the rotten economic system which has corrupted government.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber is not right on this. He's discounting the capitalism problem. What goes on at college campuses is irrelevant compared to the capitalism problem. Even if 1000 Jordan Peterson like professors are fired, it all means hardly anything compared to the capitalism problem.
</p>

<p>
	The priorities are so out of wack, even among Spirally aware people.
</p>

<p>
	The culture war is a huge distraction and it fools even intellectuals like Wilber.
</p>

<p>
	I don't buy how little Blue is shown on that chart.
</p>

<p>
	Blue is very heavy today. It's what makes FoxNews the most watch news channel in the America. And the stage Blue reaction against Green is huge. Evangelicals, fundamentalist Christians, and Mormons make up like 30%-40% of the American population alone. That charts show more Green than Blue??? That's dangerously wrong.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that it's really hard to get an accurate gauge of the stage percentages because it is too easily skewed by one's sampling bias. If you live in a big city, you will under-sample Blue and over-sample Orange.
</p>

<p>
	I'd estimate that 30-50% of Americans are seriously stuck in Blue. There is more Blue than Red. So I wouldn't trust that chart.
</p>

<p>
	Also that chart doesn't have Green starting in the late 1960's, which is just wrong.
</p>

	Systemic racism and social class are deeply linked in America for blacks in particular.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't get this, I'm not sure anyone here can help you.
</p>

<p>
	No one is claiming BLM is the solution to everything. It is a small part of a larger pro-democracy, pro-populist movement. Systemtic racism cannot be solved without reforming capitalism as well. The biggest battle is that against capitalism and neoliberalism.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Most women these days in developed democracies are taking care of themselves. I've never had to support a girlfriend financially. So the idea that women are somehow demanding that you buy them things is simply untrue. If you're buying stuff for women, you're the one who's playing into that provider frame. I expect my girlfriend to pay for her own stuff most of the time.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless, I don't have a problem providing for the woman in certain cases as long as she's able to maintain a job/career of her own. Like, if I had children with her, I'd certainly expect to provide more for her and the child since she's providing her body and emotional energy to raise the child, and probably taking time off work and sacrificing her career.
</p>

<p>
	You can find women of various kinds. Some women are more traditional and want to play the old patriarchal role where she is the house wife and you are the provider. But many women today don't want to play that role. These are stage Orange & Green women. These the ones I like. I would not date a stage Blue woman. But you can certainly find one if you want one.
</p>

<p>
	So really, today, we have the best of both worlds. It's just a matter of knowing what you want and then going for it.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter that you didn't mention it. It's still an operative force because what you're talking about is cultural norms. And cultural norms are shaped by survival necessities which have existed for thousands and hundreds of years.
</p>

<p>
	Your thinking about this is far too short-sighted and self-centered. This isn't about you or your desires. This is about how the human species deals with survival challenges.
</p>

<p>
	Sex and intimate relationships don't exist for your amusement. They exist for the survival of the species.
</p>

<p>
	The standard of men being providers applies to the last 300,000 years of human evolution. Good luck unwiring that.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be asking, why are women expected to be youthful and sexy? Why should they do this? Why is that fair? What's in it for them? It seems stupid and unnatural.

	You do understand that sperm is not retained by the body. It is peed out if it goes unused and new sperm is constantly being produced whether you ejaculate or not.

<p>
	It's wisest to seed an excuse early on in that date which you can then call upon as a reason for going home at the end.
</p>

<p>
	It's good to have something in your house which is of interest to show off. For example, your aquarium, or a photo album of your travels, or a dog/cat, etc. Something so you can say, "Let's go! I have to show you that photo album I told you about" or "I'm thinking of remodeling my kitchen and I want your advice."
</p>

<p>
	Rather than making this a lie, try to actually have some cool stuff at home that's worthy of showing off.
</p>

If a girl thinks im just okay looking or meh, so lets say 4/10. Can i still attract her or do i need to be somewhat appealing on her eyes. I am saying this because i feel like most girls do not even give guys a chance if they do not find them somewhat attractive when they first see them. If you close yourself towards something then its hard for that thing to reach you compared to being open to it and see how it is.

<p>
	You need to stop this mental masturbation and second-guessing and simply talk to more girls.
</p>

<p>
	When in doubt, talk to more girls.
</p>

<p>
	Girls are mostly not attracted to you because you're not able to convey your personality properly. You are simply uninteresting and don't subcommunicate the qualities of an awesome man.
</p>

<p>
	You need to make your personality pop. You need to stand out among all the other lame dudes out there who are sitting on forums worrying about their looks.
</p>

<p>
	Just the fact that you even care about your looks already shows how weak of a man you are.
</p>

<p>
	A man is not a doll. That's not what women need from men. Women need men to have balls.

They have to because otherwise their entire worldview would be debunked by science and history.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why the majority of Trumpists are not college educated.
</p>

<p>
	An educated person would see right through Trump's horseshit. Trump is only great at fooling the uneducated.
</p>

<p>
	Which is also why conservatives want to dismantle the public education system.

<p>
	Nationalists cannot accept the idea that their country was/is extremely corrupt and devilish, because the whole nationalist worldview assumes my country is the good guy no matter what.
</p>

<p>
	Thus nationalists are in a constant battle of denial. Which is why they make it their life's mission to attack SJWs.

	He's still subtly demonizing them.

<p>
	I guess that depends on how you define revolution.
</p>

<p>
	I think a soft revolution is more realistic. A sort of collective awakening to the limits of capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	But a hard revolution should not be something anyone of us wants, as it will devolve into devilry.

	Where in the universe does it say that a taco must bounce in order to be the same as a basketball?

<p>
	Can you see that YOU are the only one imposing that criterion?

<p>
	All criteria for difference or similarity are relative and arbitrary!

	It's not a language game, it's the foundation of your mind's BIOS.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course. Nuanced thinking is required.
</p>

<p>
	Hedges makes some great critiques of the system, but his worldview is also biased and not the highest. His understanding of spirituality is lacking. And he's has no understanding of development psychology (SD, etc.)
</p>

<p>
	There's not a single person in political commentary who you can take as having all the answers. Which is why our politics is so filled with problems. Virtually no one has found the real answers. We have to pioneer the answers.

</p>

<p>
	"Sensation" itself is a false notion. Colors, sounds, feeling, etc. are not really sensation.
</p>

<p>
	"Sensation" is a notion created by the ego-mind in order for it to believe the human self is real.
</p>

<p>
	The notion of "sensation" comes pre-baked with the notion that there is a self who is having sensations.
</p>

<p>
	See video: What Is Perception?
</p>

<p>
	Not only are all senses equal, everything in the universe is equal to everything else!
</p>

<p>
	A taco is the same as a basketball. Any difference you think exists between them is purely your bias and imagination. 
</p>

<p>
	Realize this: There is no difference between anything.

<p>
	The brain is a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	You're not getting how radical this is. Reality has no ground. Anything which you think is grounding the present moment is false. Nothing is grounding anything.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mid is playing tricks in order to maintain a sense of "reality". You must cut through all the false grounds it constructs. Including brain, Earth, universe, atoms, birth, your childhood memories, etc. It's all pure fiction!
</p>

<p>
	Nothing you think is real!

<p>
	A woman is not like a guy. She has to be turned on and seduced into horniness.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta stimulate her emotions, build an emotional connection, and then escalate physically.
</p>

<p>
	You build an emotional connection by sharing parts of your personal life story and being vulnerable with her.
</p>

<p>
	You should be looking in her eyes non-stop. This builds massive intimacy and trust.
</p>

<p>
	Make your touching playful to start. Treat her like your little sister. Be playful and put her in a playful mood.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than doing a serious kiss, you can try something like making her laugh and then doing an eskimo kiss.
</p>

<p>
	If she is willing to hold deep eye contact with you, and she's willing to let you stroke her hair, she's willing to kiss you.
</p>

<p>
	If she rejects a kiss, you just act cool, like nothing bad or weird happened, and you try again in 10 minutes after you make her laugh.
</p>

<p>
	Always escalate physical during emotional upswings. When she is laughing or smiling or happy.
</p>

<p>
	Give her hugs. And start putting your hands on her hips. If she's letting you hold her hips, she willing to fuck you.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes girls are cold. You gotta warm them up.
</p>

<p>
	Of course only you can decide those things for yourself. It's a matter of your highest values, desires, and priorities.
</p>

<p>
	In general I would say, don't give up on your dreams. But you have to be creative about how you go about them. Don't just keep doing the same old thing if it's not working. You must find new ways of pursuing your dreams, or perhaps adapting your dreams slightly.
</p>

<p>
	No achievement will ever make you happy, but at the same time, not following your dreams will make you miserable.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe you can take a couple years to work on your social life before you jump back into business? You don't want to work so long that you never have a social life.
</p>

<p>
	34 is still pretty young. If you plan things out properly you should be able to get a girlfriend and then work on your biz.
</p>

<p>
	But don't waffle around. Get clear about what you want and what order you want it in.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like she wants you but you're not being man enough to get her.
</p>

<p>
	If you want her, you should man up and go for it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get sexual with her unless you have her in an isolated location where sex can occur. If friends are around, you can do light flirting and build rapport. Once that's done, you have to isolate her and get to business.
</p>

<p>
	If a girl likes you and you hesitate too long to pull the trigger, you will lose her. Don't be afraid to go fast when you get clear signs that she wants you.
</p>

<p>
	You can test whether she wants you or not by the quality of her eye contact and whether she lets you touch her body. If she's allowing you to touch her body, that's a very positive sign and you should escalate quickly and isolate as soon as possible.
</p>

<p>
	A girl being bitchy early on can actually be a sign that she likes you. She's testing you to see if you're strong enough to be her man. You need to plow through her bullshit by not taking it seriously and keep flirting and physically escalating. Don't let her bitchiness faze you. Pretty soon you're win her over and she'll become submissive.
</p>

<p>
	If you know for sure that she told your friend that she likes you, this is as big a green light as you can possibly have. You need to get her into a bedroom ASAP.
</p>

<p>
	Stop being a pussy. Be the strong man she wants. You can't get a girl without risking rejection. Isolate her and tell her that you want her.
</p>

<p>
	Don't stop unless she explicitly rejects you.
</p>

	I don't recommend it either. He did very high doses which is dangerous. My approach is doing moderate sizes doses but doing them more often.

<p>
	I have been contemplating the metaphysics and epistemology of reality since I was 16 years old. So I had laid a deep theoretical foundation. And I'm also very good at contemplating metaphysical things.

<p>
	Of course. Why not? Almost any psychedelic can be used to have serious spiritual insight and the insights will be similar.

<p>
	You could do what he did using almost any psychedelic if you're committed enough. The magic is not in the psychedelic as much as in your intent to use it to understand reality.

<p>
	I recommend low to moderate doses which won't be so difficult to integrate.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't recommend you copy me in doing 30 days of 5-MeO-DMT. That's too much and it's not necessary. I did it because I wanted to push the edge and explore uncharted waters. I was only able to do it because I had a deep theoretical foundation and I had several years of prior experience working with psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	For a normal person such as yourself, you should be aiming for small doses done once or twice a month, with breaks in between.
</p>

<p>
	A good starting dose is 1g-2g dried mushrooms or 125ug of LSD. Or the equivalent of that on any other psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	There are dozens of wonderful psychedelics or research chemicals you can use to achieve a similar result. Through experimentation you can find which molecule works best for you. Don't assume we are all the same. Your brain chemistry is unique.
</p>

<p>
	In general I would say you're getting ahead of your skiis. Do a few small trips and just see how psychedelics make you feel. They may not be right for you, or you may find that they are perfect for you. It all depends. There are too many variables to know ahead of time. This is a domain which requires exploration and careful trial and error.

	Chris Hedges has some good ideas, but don't expect him to give a deeper spiritual context to all this.
</p>

<p>
	Collapse is not the only possibility. There is a lot of untapped progressive potential going forward and you as an individual can do a lot to build a good life.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with listening too much socialist political commentary is that it makes your thinking so collectivist that you forget that as an individual you can do a lot of stuff to escape wage slavery and build a good life.
</p>

<p>
	Listen to socialists, but don't forget to build your life. Don't buy into their excuses.

<p>
	It doesn't really take that much. That's just in the very beginning as a total fool.
</p>

<p>
	The results curve is exponential. So you will get a lot better.
</p>

<p>
	Also, when I count approaches, a lot of those approaches a very brief. Most of them are not long conversations since you will get blown out a lot very fast.

<p>
	I never claimed I have. Be careful what you assume about me.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup has an extremely steep learning curve. The first few years you will suck so bad and get very low numbers. Most of your numbers will come 5 years in. Guys who get laid a lot are either naturals or very experienced and veterans of the game.

<p>
	Sorry. I stand corrected. I was not thinking of it as a percent.
</p>

<p>
	0.2% is more realistic for a newbie. Although I knew a newbie in Vegas who slept with 25 girls in like 3 months. So it very much matters your geography and also how quickly you learn.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem will be that you will attract a LOT of hot girls, but you will be unable to close them for stupid logistical reasons.
</p>

<p>
	The most important element for getting a high lay count in pickup is becoming an absolute master of handling the logistics. You will lose 90% of girls due to logistics. Which means, 90% of girls who are ready to fuck you, you will lose. At least as a newbie. As a vet you will get good at handling all the bullshit obstacles.

<p>
	This is called neediness and women can smell it off you.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you are good at socializing you will have to train yourself to be good at socializing specifically in the context of talking to a hot girl. This is much more challenging than simply socializing with a friend. You have much to learn about communicating effectively man-to-woman with sexual intent.

	Stop confusing the guy with terrible advice. You don't understand pickup if you walk around asking girls for numbers. This is childish and it is not effective for getting laid. It reeks of neediness and low value.

<p>
	That's your projection. You have no clue how they actually see the world.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, most living beings see other living beings as objects to meet their survival needs. So your criticism amounts to nothing more than that "people are selfish". Which of course they are. The question is, how do you help people to transcend their selfishness?

<p>
	There is no way you're going to stop sexual abuse directly. You can't insert yourself into everyone's bedroom.
</p>

<p>
	The way to stop sexual abuse is by improving society as a whole, by creating a more conscious, loving, and fair society so that everyone is respected and supported, so that no one is  left out, so that people are emotionally healthy and compassionate towards each other.
</p>

<p>
	One of the best ways to reduce sexual abuse is by creating a more equal economic situation where no one is left behind.
</p>

<p>
	If you're seriously interested in that, you should start by meeting with a sexual assaulter or pedophile face to face, interviewing him, and getting to see the world from his perspective. Imagine if you were a pedophile. How would you feel and how would you see the world?
</p>

<p>
	What you will discover is that everyone who you think is an assaulter, was actually a victim themselves in some way.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Go out and socialize with girls.
</p>

<p>
	Your approach was good. The only mistake you made was that you didn't bother to socialize, you went for an instant result.
</p>

<p>
	Get interested in actually chatting girls up. Don't focus on sex so much at the start. You need to learn basic socialization skills like smiling, eye contact, and holding conversation. You can go practice this at the mall with store clerks without even hitting on them. Go start a friendly 10 minute conversation with a 60 year old granny clerk at the department store. Find out about her life and share about your life with her.
</p>

<p>
	You're not gonna ruin your life by socializing with people. Don't listen to fools here.
</p>

<p>
	You need to scout out some locations where socialization is easy. Malls, cafes, bars, clubs, stores, parks, college campuses, etc.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to understand what self-actualization means you should read Maslow's book on it: Toward A Psychology Of Being.
</p>

<p>
	Most people use that term without any idea what it means. Maslow used it to mean very specific things.

<p>
	You should distinguish between good game vs luck.
</p>

<p>
	It is terrible game to ask for a number so soon. That doesn't mean it will never work. Anything can work if you try it enough times. But the point is to become natural and charming in your interactions with women.
</p>

<p>
	Going up to a woman and immediately asking for her number is just downright creepy. This is the kind of move that gives pickup a bad name.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to be social so that dating and sex flows from it naturally. Then people won't think of you as a creeper.

<p>
	I didn't assume.
</p>

<p>
	I said that when there are massive peaceful protests there will necessarily also be violent elements and movements.
</p>

<p>
	But in the end, when peace fails, people will resort to violence -- as has been the case in all mob-led revolutions throughout history.
</p>

<p>
	Peaceful protests are a relatively recent innovation of the 20th century. Mobs weren't so kind for much of human history.

	Something like 0.000001% write articles for Wikipedia. It's a highly niche thing. It works based on power-users. Lot of academic types I imagine.

		</p>

		<p>
			 and in the beginning of the video you said ,  it is actual when you hit the moment where you become hyperconscious of  "hand"  , so what if i am just looking at it blankly without being hyperconscious of it , is that also actual or is that also imagination? can you please clarify? , because i want to the practise right
		</p>

		<p>
			By the way , Thanks for the help.

<p>
	Why are you asking me what is actual?
</p>

<p>
	If I tell you, that will be concepts coming from a human. A human could lie to you or be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Actuality cannot be wrong. Locate what is actual in your experience without asking anyone.

<p>
	So?
</p>

<p>
	There were also the Black Panthers.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, it's impossible to have only peaceful protests when things get serious. Not everyone is gonna take it lying down.
</p>

<p>
	The mob will come for you with their pitchforks if you piss them off enough. That's what's happening here.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying it's good or bad. I'm just saying how society has always worked. If Trump stays in office long enough, the mob will come for him and it won't look pretty.

	The liver is like the toxic waste dump of an animal's body. So all the heavy metals and junk that animals are fed and watered will all get stored in the liver. And then you're gonna eat that <img alt=":o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy@2x.png 2x" title=":o" width="20" />

<p>
	The thing is, his perspective is quite ahistorical.
</p>

<p>
	Peaceful protests for justice and equality are almost always demonized as violent and criminal. This serves those in power and the status quo.
</p>

<p>
	Case in point, the Civil Rights movement.
</p>

<p>
	When the citizenry feels a great injustice, they will protest. Violence will always break out because you cannot perfectly control hundreds of thousands of people. Police will crack down. And this is how progress is made. Progress is not always made through the voting system, especially when the voting system is gerrymandered and bought off by millionaires and billionaires.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives should expect more stage Green protests over the next decade as the status quo fails to meet the needs of the people. Progress will happen peacefully or violently, but it will happen.

<p>
	Don't trust humans.
</p>

<p>
	Become directly conscious of whatever is true.
</p>

<p>
	You're falling into the trap of giving someone else your authority.
</p>

<p>
	See video: How Authority Works
</p>

<p>
	If you have to ask someone to validate your awakening, you're not getting it.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness also cannot be mapped on a linear numerical scale. So that is another trap.

<p>
	As always, it's not a binary, it's a spectrum. People fall all across the spectrum. When I say introvert or extrovert it's shorthand for the two extremes of the spectrum which may not apply to you. If you're towards the middle you'll have to blend the advice from both extremes.

	Religious fundamentalists' greatest enemy is secular-humanism. So an ignorant buffoon like Trump is the perfect ally in that fight.

Meaning if you already know people, to tell a friend you have that " i find x friends of yours cute" and then she can notify her that x guy is interested and if she also is then you can start talking/dating? I am not saying to make friends for this purpose but rather asking the ones you already have for this. I personally feel this is more natural and convince than cold approaching on the street because i do not like night clubs that much and its hard to find decent girls on bars ( mostly older people) where i live.

<p>
	Social circle is great if you are an extrovert and love to do all that social stuff.

	That's how I kept myself in the illusion.

<p>
	You see, any attachment to any form will keep you from going Infinite.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be willing to surrender the entire Universe, which is a lot.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason you're in the Universe is because you're not willing to surrender it. If you were willing, you already would have done so, and it wouldn't be here.
</p>

<p>
	The Universe is something you're inventing because you're too scared to go Infinite.

	If you're a quality guy, she won't lose attraction for you by you being vulnerable. This is a fear of your own you need to transcend.

	The sick irony is that they are in fact God.

	Hitler was God, and also we removed him from power.

	Even if you are the hottest hunk on the planet, not every girl will like you and you will not be able to attract every girl.
</p>

<p>
	You should aim for maybe 1/3rd of girls liking you. The rest you ignore.
</p>

<p>
	Of course girls have different types. If you're not her type then you won't be able to attract her.
</p>

<p>
	The way you solve this problem is by talking to 5,000 women.

<p>
	It amazes me how these Integral Tier 2 guys just dismiss Green as something toxic to quickly skip over. That is such an anti-Integral take, violating the very core lesson of developmental psychology which is that you cannot just skip over stages.
</p>

<p>
	And it amazes me that they take a reactionary like JP seriously at all, as though he's not part of a regressive right-wing movement. To even parrot JP's talking point of cultural-marxists and Green as leading to gulgs is already to yield too much ground to idiocy and a fundamental misunderstanding of Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	These Integral folks are naive about politics and they discount the power of true, healthy, solid Green.
</p>

<p>
	American society is nowhere near solid Green. So they cannot be Integral Yellow at any meaningful scale. By to ignore this just feeds right-wing reactionaries and fascists, making Integral people useful enlightened idiots for the right-wing.
</p>

<p>
	For solid Green to emerge capitalism just be significantly reformed and the workplace democratized. The key missing piece is that economically America is nowhere near Green even though on cultural issues we are more advanced. It's the economy which matters the most now, not cultural issues.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, here's my new rule: any public intellectual who takes JP's political ideas seriously is not serious. You're not a serious intellectual unless you can see through JP's bullshit instantly. We need to have higher standards for public intellectuals.
</p>

<p>
	And here's another rule: any public intellectual who takes Trump or the current right-wing movement seriously, is not an intellectual but a joke and his work should simply be dismissed without any further argument.
</p>

<p>
	So, it's a very simple litmus test. You can just ask any public intellectual: Does Trump's right-wing movement have any intellectual legitimacy? And if they don't instantly say, NO, you can just laugh them out of the room. And if any public intellectual says they voted for Trump, or will vote for Trump again, they are instantly disqualified as worth listening to other than for purposes of mockery and zoological study.
</p>

<p>
	I got the opposite impression of him. I could easily empathize with his whole philosophy. It makes perfect sense given the era he was born and his overall view of the world.
</p>

<p>
	Cheney was simply protecting America. Which is exactly what selfishness is at the collective level.
</p>

<p>
	Cheney was acting out of love.

	That's exactly what happens with ideology. People blindly follow the ideology without thinking about anything independent for themselves.

	States of consciousness are not quantifiable and they are not linear.
</p>

<p>
	And there are states far beyond what is described on that page.
</p>

<p>
	I'd say Infinite Consciousness is the highest I've experienced, when consciousness becomes infinitely self-aware to the point of an infinite formless singularity.

Whatever you write at the beginning has to match up with whatever you write at the end. So if you say in the beginning of the novel that a character was born 20 years ago, that's what is true relative to your imagination of it. If later you change it to 10 years, that contradicts your own imaginary narrative.
</p>

<p>
	So the key to maintaining a "reality" is to imagine it consistently and stick to your story as if it was real.
</p>

<p>
	That is the problem. You're taking this stuff on as belief, which is actually harmful.
</p>

<p>
	There is a huge difference between believing in Buddhism vs actually becoming conscious that you are God/Love.
</p>

<p>
	Nihilism is belief and ego based.
</p>

<p>
	God is Love and passion.
</p>

<p>
	Realizing that everything is imaginary should heighten your passion, not lessen it. It's awesome to know that reality is a dream. This is the best possible news! You should want reality to be mystical rather than material. Materialism is boring and bleak. Mysticism is awesome and magical.
</p>

<p>
	What better news could you receive than that EVERYTHING is imaginary!
</p>

<p>
	Think about it.
</p>

<p>
	It's amusing when people who use and glorify violence then act shocked and cry for peace when mild violence is used against their interests.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Green will certainly resort to mild forms of violence in the cause for justice.

<title>If God is again experiencing all of Infinity, why would it come back to limited?</title>

<p>
	Because there is no difference.
</p>

<p>
	There is nowhere to go. Everywhere is equally good and equally nowhere.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is that you have a bias towards one thing or another. You think being infinite is better than being finite, but that's a bias! God doesn't have any biases so it is happy to become all things.
</p>

<p>
	From God's POV, becoming an ant is just as good as becoming Albert Einstein or Jesus or Hitler.
</p>

<p>
	Because God is all those things.
</p>

<p>
	When you are conscious that you are everything, you don't mind being everything.
</p>

<p>
	Not as awake as he could be.
</p>

<p>
	But also, Wilber spends a lot of his time talking about the relative. So you have to be careful with this models. His models are useful for relative world stuff. They are useful from the POV of science, for example. But they will hold you back from understanding the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Wilber's AQAL model is great in many relative contexts, like in understanding politics, for example. Just don't try to use it to get to God.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to make all this a lot easier, just take a psychedelic and you will be shown what Love is.

<p>
	I'd say this is beyond traditional Blue. It's more like healthy Blue/Orange with hints of Green.

<p>
	Hardcore Blue would not support something like BLM, LGBTQ+ or protests.

<p>
	They also misspelled LGBTQ+, Lol <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
