			Leo, you are absolutely right those are very serious issues. And I care about those things. To me, JP is pointing to those top capitalist who are using their influence to use propaganda in the media and lobby the government in an effort to create a totalitarian system. I think JP and libertarianism sprang up for this reason. Even JP in his book talks about not being an ideologue about anything. I went through a phase of libertarianism, watched some Milton Friedman material, I felt it was necessary to really understand the effect of individualism, but I also saw its limitations. Which I believe there is an alternative to the capitalism we have now and the communism that happened then.

<p>
	Libertarianism is a stage Orange trap. It will not solve those social issues. It will actually worsen them.
</p>

<p>
	You are NOT going to curb pollution by deregulation. You will only get more pollution.
</p>

<p>
	In a free marketplace, ego will exploit, dominate, monopolize, and enslave everyone it can, until it stopped by use of force.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarianism is fundamentally untenable because it does not understand how ego works, how exploitative ego is.
</p>

<p>
	If allowed, ego will enslave and rape. The history books are filled with that.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot tame the ego to good behavior through reason and moral principles, as libertarians imagine. State use of force is absolutely required.
</p>

<p>
	Anarchism is even more naive and foolish than libertarianism.
</p>

One trip will be worth 100 hours of my videos. Of course, it's precisely because this vehicle is so effective that most people do not want to use it. Because it was never their desire to wake up. The biggest bottleneck in this work is desire. People just don't desire to understand reality deeply. And so they never do.
</p>

<p>
	You tend to get from life exactly what you desire. Weak desire, wrong desire results in a weak life, wrong life.

<p>
	It's not a valid concern because: A) no mainstream person anywhere is advocating communism or Marxism, B) stage Green is not communism. There is not a single communist elected official in America.
</p>

<p>
	You have to start to become aware of capitalist propaganda. It goes almost unnoticed in the US.
</p>

<p>
	Read some Noam Chomsky if you want to understand how this propaganda game works.
</p>

<p>
	Valid political concerns would be: gross income inequality, corporate corruption of government through lobbying and dark money, the military-industrial complex pushing for endless wars and arms deals, 50,000+ people dying every year from corporate pushing of prescription opioid drugs, and environmental pollution which gives people cancer and disease.
</p>

<p>
	These are real measurable issues that kill tens of thousands of people very year. These issues need solutions which stage Blue & Orange cannot provide. Only Green+ can attempt to solve those problems.

</p>

<p>
	Which is why the alt-right is so obsessed with cucking. It's a projection of their own fears.
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing original about this value system. It's been the dominant value system for over 1000 years. But now it is dying in Western democratic countries all over the world. But Blue will not let it go. Hence people JP construct a clingy ideology to counteract the inevitable.

<p>
	By JP's logic we should abolish capitalism and install socialism.
</p>

<p>
	JP is bitching about sexual inequality while being completely oblivious of the most glaring inequality in society: money & power!
</p>

<p>
	The entire argument for socialism is that the money and power hierarchy has become way too steep to the point of destabilizing society.
</p>

<p>
	Yet all of this is totally lost on JP as he worries about feminists robbing men of the sexual power they amassed over centuries of stage Blue patriarchy.
</p>

<p>
	The way a stage Blue ego-mind works is, it is hyper-sensitive to the dangers of new progressive ideas, but totally in denial of the destabilizing dangers of the status quo. Because fundamentally, stage Blue ego is fighting to defend the status quo regardless of what the status quo is or does. That is Blue's agenda. That is JP's agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Somehow tens of millions of poor wage slaves is okay, but tens of thousands of sexually incompetent incels is a giant problem in need of a socialist-like redistribution of vagina. How convenient that redistribution of power is totally fine, and even paramount, so long as the power is being redistributed back to the top of the old Blue hierarchy. The top on which JP and his fanboys would like to make their nest.
</p>

<p>
	JP is a rooster squawking because his roost is being removed.
</p>

<p>
	Joe pokes holes in JP's bullshit Blue value system very quickly.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to sound coherent when you're speaking to a crowd of angsty young white males age 18-24 who have never bothered to seriously study politics, feminism, government, post-modernism, socialism, philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, psychology, science, sociology, history, religion, mysticism, or self-help.
</p>

<p>
	All you gotta do is tell them what they want to hear and to their ego-mind it will sound coherent.
</p>

<p>
	Also, eloquence has nothing to do with truth, reality, development level, or consciousness. The most eloquent people are usually full of shit.

It's about the level of depth one grasps it at.
</p>

<p>
	As I have said many times before -- but people refuse to hear me -- there are incredible degrees of depth to this work. Whatever you think you've understood or grasped, you can understand and grasp it 1000x deeper.
</p>

<p>
	People mislead themselves by looking for new topics, new teachings, new experiences, when what is really most paramount is grasping old vanilla teaching more fully.
</p>

<p>
	How deeply do you understand what existence is?
</p>

<p>
	That is the key thing.
</p>

<p>
	Well, at least this shows you are starting to question existence. Which is the most important point. Of course none of the above is actual conscious, it's more just your mind starting to realize that conventional knowledge is a farce.
</p>

<p>
	Reality did not come out of nothing. It is nothing. Something and nothing are identical. The mistake is seperating the two, holding them as opposites.
</p>

<p>
	Not everyone is a whore. And there are many degrees of whoring.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out with this overly simplistic, fatalistic thinking.
</p>

<p>
	If not being a whore is important to you, you can design such a life. Saying that everyone is a whore is like saying everyone is a criminal. That's a very convenient way to think if you are a criminal.

This was specifically related to arguments with false equivalence being the fallacy. I think it's in fact kind of lazy. <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />
		</p>

		<p>
			There is a large difference between an islamist fundamentalist and a harvard lawyer. If you compare those two with the comparison of two other random people, there's no difference in the amount of difference. But it depends what difference we're comparing those two on.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the wikipedia example, it was between the suitability of pet between a snail and a cat.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's one of spilling oil:
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is no different from your neighbor dripping some oil on the ground when changing oil in his car."</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>(the comparison is between things differing by many orders of magnitude: Deepwater Horizon spilled 210 million US gal; 780,000 m3 of oil, your neighbor might spill perhaps a pint.)</em>
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	All of this is purely subjective and relative -- a construction of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The differences are large and significant only because your ego says so.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how you sneak your egoic agenda into the discussion to help you convince yourself that you have a winning argument here. The oil spill only matters because you think it matters to your survival. The oil spill is a positive thing from the perspective of bacteria that thrive off eating the dead animals killed by the spill.
</p>

<p>
	All argument is ego, not truth.
</p>

<p>
	Once you see the truth, you will stop all argument.
</p>

	It does not have to be that way. That's the way of lazy sheep.
</p>

<p>
	That happens to people because they never do personal development.

<p>
	Senility is not just some random affliction. It is caused by things like improper diet, improper use of one's mind and body, and improper lifestyle.

<p>
	Well, it does vary from person to person, but yeah, that's generally how it feels. You start to feel like you're inside a dream, everything is consciousness, and you are God looking through your own eyes.
</p>

<p>
	What once felt like a solid, heavy, material, physical reality now feels like an airy, intelligent, living, fluid field of spirit.
</p>

<p>
	Your body just becomes an extension of your mind.

</p>

<p>
	You can function very well from abiding nondual awareness. But not so much on a 5-MeO peak. The 5-MeO peak is too nondual to be practical for everyday living. Which is precisely why normal and even enlightened people are not that conscious 24/7. At a certain point you can become so conscious that there is no world any more.

<p>
	It's very common to have brief glimpses of nonduality and then fall back into duality.
</p>

<p>
	But after a certain point, after enough glimpses, something should crack in you and then nonduality becomes your permanent way of seeing the world.

	Take extreme ownership of the problem and get a job or start a business.
</p>

<p>
	Freedom is purchased through hard work and strategic thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Flailing your arms around is not going to solve this problem.

<title>Is Psychology only based on the ego ?</title>

<p>
	Much of academic psychology is pretty crude. It certainly won't incorporate spiritual or mystical insights. But there's some value in it.
</p>

<p>
	What you really want is transpersonal psychology, humanistic psychology, positive psychology.
</p>

<p>
	Or just straight up spirituality, mysticism, and nonduality.
</p>

Which is why I don't recommend taking psychedelics to those under 21.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics require enormous maturity and wisdom to use properly.
</p>

<p>
	They are a tool of the gods, not for fools.

	Nice quote.
</p>

<p>
	Yes. Whitehead was the kind of scientific mind which is rarely seen these days.
</p>

<p>
	His later works are quite good. He understood the ignorance of positivism, materialism, and reductionism.
</p>

<p>
	It's like modern scientists are going through an idiocracy phase.

<p>
	It doesn't. It just makes you aware that you are inside a hallucination whereas previously you weren't.
</p>

<p>
	It makes you aware of the full ramifications of your own logic, because right now you still aren't.

<p>
	Teens in native tribal cultures do psychedelics all the time, and have been doing it for over 5000 years.
</p>

<p>
	Case closed.
</p>

<p>
	What's really damaging is all the TV you watch, all the video games you play, and all the garbage junk food you eat. Why ain't you worried about that?

So by your own thought process, your entire thought process is contingent on an arbitrary soup of chemicals. According to you, all human knowledge is a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	And you are right. But if you are right, that means the brain, chemicals, the body, the universe, and science are also hallucinations. It even means that you being right is also a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	So what now? Anything you think or do is a hallucination (according to you).

<p>
	To some degree, but not 100%. Depends a lot on your particular situation and what caused the cancer. If your body is full of toxic chemicals you may be screwed.

	You were never told to physically harm yourself. Stop being foolish.

	Enlightenment is a purely awareness-based pursuit.

<p>
	Shamanic Breathing!
</p>

<p>
	Oh, boy, watch out what you wish for with that one.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are super too. Best tool for PTSD. Clinically proven.
</p>

<p>
	Go do an ayahausca retreat in Peru and you should come back a new man/woman.
</p>

<p>
	Don't waste your time and money with shallow talk-therapy when it comes to serious trauma. Bring out the big guns and nuke that shit.
</p>

<p>
	Schedule a Holotropic Breathwork workshop.

<title>How to do an OUTDOORS Solo Retreat?</title>

<p>
	That's quite tricky. You're basically talking about camping skills.
</p>

<p>
	Go camping a few times without any retreat or meditation and just learn how to camp.
</p>

<p>
	You'll need to stock up in quite a bit of supplies. Dealing with the heat, rain, and cold will be tricky. Snakes, bugs, cougars, and bears can be tricky too.
</p>

<p>
	Many places in CA will require camping permits and camp ground reservations.
</p>

<p>
	But it could be a really great growing experience if you manage to figure out all those logistics.
</p>

<p>
	You'll want a first-aid kit, GPS, and some kind of weapon against creatures.

</p>

<p>
	Seems to me that she did this for so long and so severely that she ended up causing her own brain cancer.
</p>

<p>
	If she had access to some of the videos on Actualized.org, she would have been fine I think. It took her many years to find some realized teachers to help straighten her out.
</p>

<p>
	Consider yourselves lucky that you're alive in the age of Youtube and a flood of free nonduality videos. Where you can literally go to Google and find the answer to any question or problem you might ever have in life. People take this ability so for granted.
</p>

<p>
	In a world full of insane people, when you become sane, but have no one to talk to about it, you might find yourself thinking you've gone insane.

Western philosophers are masters at weaving together genius and bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	Best to stick to modern nonduality teachers for the most of you. So you don't waste your time.
</p>

<p>
	The books on my book list are what you should be focused on reading and mastering. You'll notice, I don't put a lot of philosophy books on there.

<p>
	I started doing my first businesses when I was 15.
</p>

<p>
	I was registering corporations before I was even allowed to legally own one.
</p>

<p>
	I owned stocks before I was allowed to legally own them.
</p>

<p>
	I got a scuba diving license before the age when I was allowed to legally have one.
</p>

<p>
	No excuses. Creative people find creative solutions.
</p>

<p>
	When I was at that age I thought very strongly that teens should have the same rights as adults. Then I found out how stupid most teens were and now I've changed my mind. Most people should not even be allowed to drive or have kids till they are 25.

<title>Can you escape wage slavery before becoming one?</title>

You'll probably have to do some amount of it in the beginning.
</p>

<p>
	That's not too big of a problem if it's part of your escape strategy.
</p>

<p>
	The issue is, most people never even had an escape strategy. Then it's really hard to escape.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are like that squirrel who didn't stock up on acorns for winter. Winter is not the problem. The problem is you didn't prepare, and now you're cornered.
</p>

<p>
	Now you gotta work twice as hard to find a solution.

	You just take it for granted that people have a crystal clear conceptual understanding of spirituality and enlightenment. That's cause I've spoiled you guys with videos explaining everything.

<p>
	No ordinary person knows this shit. Not even close. Not even conceptually.

<p>
	The typical spiritual practitioner could not describe what enlightenment is in one sentence if his life depended on it. Never mind knowledge of all the complications and traps that come with it.

That is the game of academic philosophy, which might win a battle here or there on technical points, but always loses the war.
</p>

<p>
	Every major Western philosopher basically made a few good points along with a bunch of nonsense. And now we have to waste thousands of hours sorting the few tidbits of wisdom from the overall pile of delusion.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is Neitzche did not have a good understanding the origins of religion. He was reacting against corruption within religion. Which is like shooting fish in a barrel.
</p>

<p>
	Is Neitzche a paragon of integral thinking? Is reading him going to teach you how to be a integral thinker? Your time would be better spent reading some Ken Wilber. That's what real Yellow looks like.
</p>

<p>
	After I realized God, my understanding of and compassion for Christianity shot through the roof. Even though there's so much corruption and stupidity within it. It's like watching a little child giving his best but just failing over and over again. The harder he tries, the harder he fails. It's sad really.
</p>

<p>
	The Christians know not what they preach. The devil sunk his fangs into them real good.
</p>

<p>
	There is a very big difference between thinking you're a thought, and being aware that you are a thought.
</p>

<p>
	You've gotten to the point where you understand no-self conceptually (which is good), but now the real work begins: grasping it ACTUALLY!
</p>

<p>
	Knowing is NOT enough. Knowing must end and Being must replace it.
</p>

<p>
	It is not enough to know that Sam isn't real, Sam must actually cease to exist. ACTUALLY!
</p>

<p>
	Thinking and imagining stuff is NOT actual.
</p>

<p>
	You must deeply realize that you were never born! Your birth is a conceptual story. What is ACTUAL if you stop assuming you were born as a human being? If we erase all your memories and all your thoughts, what is left?
</p>

<p>
	This room? This body? This universe? -- NO! Those are all thoughts!
</p>

<p>
	What is ACTUAL???
</p>

<p>
	Press your awareness on what is ACTUAL, like sizzling bacon to a frying pan, and hold it there, wondering what actuality is.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Psychedelics help. A lot.

Do you cry over it? Do you get angry? Do you seek revenge on the Koopas?
</p>

<p>
	No, because you're aware it's just a game. If you take the game too seriously, you may get so mesmerized by it that you actually get angry at the Koopas.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise with life.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is, you don't think life is a game. You <u><strong>think</strong></u> it is very real.
</p>

<p>
	The operative word there is "think". Just because you think something is real does not make it so.
</p>

<p>
	The logic of all this is very simple. The problem is, you're not being logical about life, you're highly biased by your fear of death. So your thinking is highly irrational and distorted by your preoccupation with living. You actually have to be insane to believe that life matters.
</p>

<p>
	The trouble with insane people is, they don't know they're insane. If they did, they'd be sane!

<p>
	You can't take away being. Where are you gonna put it? Being already IS nowhere and nothing!
</p>

<p>
	Existence is nothing. It never really happened. There is no difference between existence happening and not happening.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that existence never happened. Well, that's what this is!!! You are inside of Nothing right now! You've just mistaken it for something.
</p>

<p>
	That's right. The mind cannot comprehend Nothing. Comprehension is something.
</p>

<p>
	If you had the set of all possible things, that set -- to truly be the set of all possible things -- must include its own negation. Therefore EVERYTHING = NOTHING. Everything and Nothing go full-circle.
</p>

<p>
	If Nothing was excluded from Everything, then Everything would not be Everything. Everything must be all-inclusive, including every possible exclusion!
</p>

<p>
	Paradox is not a bug here, it's the key feature!
