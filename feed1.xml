			Specifically because of this is why it's important to not throw away all of the dualistic definitions when dealing with those societies and cultures. Speaking in nondual terms to dualistic minds is like speaking Latin to a Korean. It's a completely different language that sounds like hokey to those who don't understand it.

<p>
	We are not saying to do away with all dualistic notions. Language is always dualistic so that would not even be possible.
</p>

<p>
	What we are saying is to be more conscious of the socially constructed nature of human institutions and culture.

			But what about a community without walls or it's own rules, within an existing country like the US? For example if you got a bunch of enlightened people together to live in one area. They would transform that area by changing the local politics, building and running conscious businesses together and the influence would spread. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I've seen this work on a small scale. For example there is one very stage green artsy community in among a wide area of stage blue territory here. It's law of attraction at work even if they aren't aware of it themselves.

	Of course that already happens. But its too small to really address any serious world problems.

			Thus, to 99.9999% of the world, I am an American. That's not by my personal definition. But it still applies. The difference between myself and, say, Trump in this regard is that being an American does not define me. It's just one of a million words that describes the conditions I live in.

<p>
	You are underestimating how much these kinds of constructions contribute to your sense of self and how much they shape the behaviors of hundreds of millions of people. This is not merely about you. This is about entire societies and cultures.

<p>
	In practice, no you can't, because we live in a globalized world. You cannot just build a wall between your community and the outside world. Because fundamentally everything is interconnected. Eventually your commune would die out or become a cancer.
</p>

<p>
	The issue of running a good society is very complex. You cannot it do it in isolation, or by sticking your head in the sand, or by ignoring issues of mass scale. Whatever solutions you imagine must work at the scale of 100s of millions of people AT LEAST, and even at the scale of 7 billion. Otherwise you're not actually addressing the deepest issues, you're just offloading them on someone else to solve.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can create a small commune of millionaires who live on a golf course in a gated community with security guards. But this is all made possible by the larger society which maintains the police, military, legal system, monetary system, education system, fire department, important regulations, food inspections, vaccinations, environmental protections, trade treaties, taxation, nuclear weapons, telecommunications, immigration, airports, etc, etc. Your little commune could not exist without all that as supporting infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
	Just as an example of how everything is interconnected: let's say you build your perfect little commune on a tropical island. Everything is going great until some large corporation decides to use your island chain as nuclear dump site. A giant oil tanker full of nuclear waste material come and dumps 100 tons of radioactive material on a neighboring island. This material leeches into the water and gives 70% of the people on your island cancer which you cannot cure without flying back to the mainland. But to cure your cancer requires you pay $100,000 in medical bills which you cannot afford because you lived on a remote island with no major economy. You have no way to stop this from happening because your island is without any political power. So your commune very soon dies.
</p>

			We could go back to something like what America was when the Native Americans lived here with no concepts of land ownership. The fictions of wealth, expensive properties and buildings are what make that impossible. An enlightened society would resemble what America was before Columbus, but without the disconnection and warfare caused by tribalism.

<p>
	I am not saying that we need to eliminate all social constructions. Social constructions are necessary and useful. We just need to be conscious and honest that they are social constructions, not objective things. And we need to not get out identities attached to them.
</p>

<p>
	300 million people can never go back to living in a pre-Columbus society. This is not possible due to problems of scale and technological and cultural evolution. You cannot put the genie back in the bottle. 300 million people requires SERIOUS bureaucracy to manage. Bureaucracy itself is not the problem. The problem is corruption in the bureaucracy, which can and must be eliminated.
</p>

<p>
	The invention of modern bureaucracy is a miracle greater than electricity. Without it your life would be so awful it would hardly be worth living. People take all this for granted.

<p>
	1-2g is good for that.
</p>

<p>
	Just set a genuine intention to know. Frame your question and ask it in your mind a bunch of times before the trip. Then let the mushrooms show you. They may at first show you other stuff before they finally show you want you ultimately want. Sometimes to get what you ultimately want you must go through a few detours and work out some kinks in yourself.

			BUT LEO! You told me I have to get involved in politics again instead of having my head stuck in the sand. I was a patriotic American, I let go if it, I hated my country, I embodied no identity, and then I had an awakening and I realized that America is a huge part of my (God's) creation.

<p>
	Yes, you DO have to get involved in politics. But not from a position of ego.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying you should hate your country or deny whatever country you live in. Just don't confuse it with who/what you are. America is a very small part of God's creation, and really, it's a creation of your mind. God does not know or see any America.
</p>

<p>
	All that's being said here is to be conscious of the socially constructed nature of all these social constructs like money, political parties, nation states, races, genders, etc. Do not confuse any of that stuff with Truth or with yourself. Do not take any of it personally. Use it and enjoy it, but don't attach to it.

<p>
	It's only true in your mind. "America" is something you invented. If you think you're "an American" you invented that. It's very important to be conscious of that.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a bunch of people get together and say that "this is America" doesn't make it so. It's a collective hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, no two people in the world agree on what "America" even means. Everyone has their own ideas about what America is and ought to be. Some people believe America is "The Great Satan". And they're not entirely wrong. If Americans are not devils, who is?

			Would you say that traditional techniques (such as vipassana) were developed for highly functional people? (that's something I've been wondering about for a long time now)

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, most of the best meditation techniques were developed by the most advanced sages of mankind. They were exceptionally gifted and highly functional (for the most part).
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean that a dysfunctional person can't benefit from Vipasanna. That would be a misguided conclusion.

			Do you have any insight as to how people starting from less functional places (such as your usual anxiety and depressive disorders, having lived through trauma, etc., or just motivated by lack) should approach the field differently?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yeah, lots could be said about that. Books could be written about that, and have. There are many books written by people who went through long periods of recovery and healing before ultimately awakening.
</p>

<p>
	I would definitely suggest doing more basic self-help work. Tackling advanced metaphysical topics for dysfunctional people wouldn't be too effective I imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Going from dysfunctional to functional is actually a very good approach. Traditionally, dysfunctional people were not even allowed to get initiated into yoga, for example, because you need to have your shit together to do yoga properly. There are qualifications for serious spiritual seekers for good reason. Spirituality is not for slobs and rubes. Spirituality requires high maturity and innate wisdom. Otherwise it get corrupted into evil.
</p>

<p>
	But this doesn't mean you can't have some kind of mild spiritual practice while you're doing basic self-help / healing. You can. Just don't expect it to take to the highest levels of insight.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, developing a spiritual connection is a big part of the answer. But also developing that connection properly is not easy. It requires serious commitment and work. Which many dysfunctional people are unable to muster. But again, don't take this on as a limiting belief. No one is stopping you but yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps the biggest obstacle for a dysfunctional person is that he/she will simply be unable to tolerate the stark brutality of the Truth which spirituality reveals. Which is why they are dysfunctional in the first place. Weak people cannot handle hearing the Truth. They have all sorts of twisted defense mechanisms to deny it all day long.
</p>

<p>
	Developing a genuine desire for raw truth is essential to spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	The key point is that you realize that there is no boundary whatsoever between you and all other sentient beings. And that all identities are fabrications for purposes of survival.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you're an American, that's something you fabricated to make yourself feel good. It's not true and it's an unconscious survival function.
</p>

<p>
	This becomes very problematic when people refuse to admit that they fabricate such identities. Which of course all nationalists will refuse to admit. The whole point is to ground the ego in that identity in order to deny Emptiness.

<p>
	The avoidance of suffering is a problematic source of motivation because avoidance of suffering rarely leads to Truth. It can, but 99% of the time it leads to various forms of devilry and delusion. Because there are so many ways to mollify the suffering with illusion. And the desire to escape suffering itself ends up creating the most suffering. What is it that wants to escape suffering? Mostly ego. And of course it doesn't really want Truth, it merely wants pleasure. And as soon as your suffering is mitigated, you stop caring about Truth. That's the problem with negative motivation. It produces yo-yo effects. The more your suffering is reduced the less you care about Truth. Which means you're unlikely to ever reach it. Whereas if your whole motivation was Truth, you'd reach it very quickly.
</p>

<p>
	Wanting the Truth is the highest kind of motivation for this work. The highest masters didn't get that way to avoid suffering. They got that way because the loved and valued Truth so highly they were will willing to incur enormous suffering to reach it. But of course this kind of motivation is rare.
</p>

<p>
	As the proverb goes: a fool will learn no other way than through suffering. Which means the wise aren't motivated that way.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well of course I am always under the influence of ego-mind. It's a matter of being aware of it and not letting it get out of hand.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I can get into ego traps, but I'm generally aware enough to realize when it is happening, even if I cannot immediately stop it, at least I know what is happening, whereas many people do not. And I'm very careful when it comes to epistemic traps.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem is when people haven't studied enough high quality sources to even know which traps exist. Then they can get really off track. Most people who do spirituality do not study nearly enough, so they are ripe for traps. They think they can just wing their way through this, and of course they can't. This field is far to tricky and subtle to wing it.
</p>

<p>
	It's a miracle that any Buddhas make it at all.

<p>
	Many people get into spirituality due to intense suffering. That is very common.
</p>

<p>
	My point is though, that is not the only way to get into spirituality. That's not why I do spirituality for example. I do it to seek Truth, wisdom, and understanding. My point is, I want this path to be open to people who just want truth for truth's sake, not just because they seek to escape suffering.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that one must be deeply dysfunctional to get into spirituality is not a good one to spread. Spirituality is for highly functional people (and also dysfunctional ones).
</p>

			I will say one last thing ok. People don't just end up on this site, or being aware of nonduality without having some kind of mental or physical ailment (something wrong with them). It's just an observation of mine...just a very consistent one. Sometimes it's a personality disorder, sometimes it's someone who has massive depression, maybe someone who's just a real loser or anything else that causes you pain. The kind of suffering that is usually constant (every day). It might even be something as small as not being good looking and having low self esteem or something.

<p>
	Do not make such generalizations.
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally this work is not about avoiding suffering, it is about a desire for the deepest truth, wisdom, and love. Not because you lack or suffer but because you desire it.
</p>

<p>
	Lack is a poor motivation source.

Myself included. This can be a valuable tool to help society move forward, but not if people are scared off by all the toxicity. Again, hard position to be in. I don't envy.

<p>
	It's important to distinguish learning facts and memorizing stuff from learning wisdom and core principles.
</p>

<p>
	These are two very different pursuits.
</p>

<p>
	Learning facts and memorizing stuff is rather pointless and can even be counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	Wisdom, however, is never forgotten. Deep understanding is permanent.

			A few days ago, I clearly saw that my idea of self was just a story and I even wept, grieving that loss. But now, a few days later, I'm writing this as if nothing happened and the sense of self is present, alive and kicking, distinguishing "me" from everything else. It's very tricky..

<p>
	The self is RELENTLESS!

<p>
	It's way trickier than you can possibility imagine at this point.

<p>
	The self will not allow itself to be deconstructed. Because you're barking up the tree of life & death.
</p>

<p>
	Even after a deep awakening the self will tend to regroup and come back with a vengeance. Your whole life hinges on it.

<p>
	You're confused because:

<p>
	1) You're not really interested in learning, you're here with a closed mind defending your existing positions.
</p>

<p>
	2) You're not seriously studying the books.
</p>

<p>
	3) You're not doing any serious spiritual practices.
</p>

<p>
	4) You're not taking responsibility for the truth-seeking process.
</p>

<p>
	You are wasting your time here and spreading misinformation. If you want the highest wisdom, empty your cup first.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Because you are conscious!
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is all there is. There is no such thing as unconsciousness. Unconsciousness is an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Anything you imagine, including non-existence or unconsciousness is happening within consciousness!
</p>

<p>
	So non-existence is actually impossible. You have to be vary careful here not to conflate objects within consciousness with consciousness itself. Pure empty consciousness cannot be destroyed. Objects within consciousness arise and pass away all the time, like images on a TV screen.
</p>

<p>
	If you're coming from the materialist paradigm, you hold consciousness is a biological product of a material reality. This is completely incorrect. Consciousness is not a biological or even a physical thing. It has nothing to do with your body or brain, or even life.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is consciousness interacting with itself.

<p>
	LSD doesn't give vision, it just expands and changes what consciousness is doing. It changes the rules by which consciousness operates.

</p>

<p>
	It would not be love if it was coerced or mandated.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of love is that's totally free and optional. No one forces God to love, love is chosen freely.
</p>

<p>
	Love is its own point and reward. If you expect a reward for loving, or a punishment for not-loving, then you're not actually loving a thing, you're being coerced.
</p>

<p>
	God does not coerce anyone. You are totally free to be monster and kill everyone on the planet. The point is, if you were conscious and intelligent you would never do that, you would choose love instead. Not because there is some external reason, but simply because a conscious person chooses to be Good, chooses to be Love, because that's what he wants to be.
</p>

<p>
	If you learn that life is a dream and this makes you eager to go on a killing spree, that shows us your true colors. That shows us your level of consciousness. A highly conscious person would choose to love even in a dream, because love is true colors.
</p>

<p>
	You choose to be love because you want to be love not because you have to be love.
</p>

What are indicators that the ego is re-emerging, co-opting and avoiding facing itself by externalizing the action via preaching to others.? (vs a more pure egoless form of communication).
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, to truly awaken one will have to investigate the mechanics of the ego-mind extensively. By that point one should be very familiar with various tricks of the ego-mind. But still, the ego-mind is extremely crafty. It can still trick you.
</p>

<p>
	The most common trap here would be for a spiritual or "awakened" ego to develop, where you build up a self-image of being the guru which gives you juicy payoffs like power over others, others worshiping you, feeling special and unique, feeling better than others, feeling like you're flawless and can do no harm simply because you've had a glimpse of God, being unreceptive to feedback from outsiders, thinking you've reached the end of this work, avoiding your own psychological baggage and shadow issues, etc. These are all very common.
</p>

<p>
	When you teach it has to come from abundance not lack. You must have a desire to make people independent of you rather than dependent on you as their savior. By making people dependent on you, you start to trip on the power. That's ego.
</p>

<p>
	You must also be careful not to let your cult following grow out of hand, the way it happened with Osho. The desire to start a new global movement / religion is very tempting and dangerous.

</p>

<p>
	The fact is, you haven't ever seen "a human" or "yourself". Those are conceptual constructions. You are not a human. Humans are something you made up!
</p>

<p>
	It's rather like Super Mario World. Mario thinks that eating a mushrooms causes him to grow in size, but actually the mushroom has no actual causal effect. It's the computer which is causing the entire world of Mario to act as it does, of which Mario is totally unaware.

<p>
	The desire to help awaken others is a very noble one. But you must be careful not to let the ego co-opt it and turn it into the lesser Jihad. The ego would love nothing more than to avoid facing itself by externalizing the action via preaching to others.
</p>

<p>
	Also it's important to understand that there are many paths to awakening. Your path is not the only path or the best path. So preach with caution, recognizing the validity of other paths which may look very different from your own.
</p>

	It's okay to have weaknesses. We all have them. They are only a problem if you let them get out of hand.

<p>
	That's pretty vague. It could be various things.
</p>

<p>
	But just speaking in gross generalities here: the hero's ultimate obstacle is the ego. So in the Belly of The Whale is where he faces his greatest enemy: himself. The ego is broken down through intense suffering, the old hero dies, a new hero is reborn, and then it is this new hero who slays the dragon.
</p>

<p>
	Facing your own death is another way to put it.

<title>Is Nationalism bad?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/34984-is-nationalism-bad/?do=findComment&amp;comment=429791</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>
	Nationalism isn't bad because good and bad do not exist.
</p>

<p>
	But nationalism is problematic because it is divisive. It fails to recongize and honor the fundamental unity of all human beings by pitting one tribe of humans against another. It inevitably leads to hatred, violence, and war.
</p>

<p>
	Nationalism is the prime example of collective ego in action. So nationalism suffers from all the same problems at excessive ego suffers from. And ultimately it ends up destroying itself.
</p>

<p>
	Being passionate about ego, judgment, hatred, division, and violence is very problematic. Passion alone isn't enough, it must be channeled towards love rather than fear and hate.
</p>

<p>
	All nationalist movements are fundamentally fear-based. They come from a position of scarcity and falsehood. They are anti-spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	A high consciousness being will have a loving, inclusive, global perspective. Not a narrow, divisive, tribal one.
</p>

<p>
	If you were totally conscious you would have absolutely nothing to defend or fear, and you would not judge or hate anyone or anything.
</p>

<title>What if you are old?</title>

The point is simply a very practical one: the older you get the less time you have to build a foundation from scratch and the less energy you will have to work with. This is not meant to be a limiting belief, but a factual statement. If this statement wasn't factual the question of age wouldn't even arise at all.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that you can't do it, it's just that maybe there's an even bigger game you could play! Which is spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	One of the best benefits of being older and retired is that you can really focus on spiritual work in a way that people who are building careers cannot. Starting a new business or career takes a lot of time and energy which could be used for spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	But it all depends on your priorities. The best you can do is follow your heart.
</p>

<p>
	You know in Hinduism they have a pretty nice model for how to structure one's life:
</p>

<p>
	Phase 1 of life: Growing up to adulthood, education
</p>

<p>
	Phase 2 of life: Getting a job, having a family, taking care of them
</p>

<p>
	Phase 3 of life: After the kids are grown and out of the house, and your finances are stabilized, you retire and pursue enlightenment full time. This is really supposed to be the pinnacle of life. Not a downer.
</p>

<p>
	Then you after your enlightenment you can become a guru and contribute wisdom back to the young.
</p>

<p>
	It's a pretty good model. Of course you can break all the rules and do whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	That's one way of looking at it.
</p>

<p>
	Another way of looking at it is that there is one Universal Mind which is simultaneously dreaming an infinite number of individual dreams, all of them interconnected with each other.
</p>

<p>
	I have used the analogy before of an infinite sponge, where each bubble represents one dream.

<p>
	Infinity is not about the physical dimensions of space, time, or the universe. We are not simply saying that time and space extend forever without end.
</p>

<p>
	It's way bigger and more profound than that.
</p>

<p>
	We are saying that consciousness itself is Infinite. We are saying that Mind is Infinite. Meaning that it can dream up an infinite number of things out of thin air.
</p>

<p>
	Start to think of the universe not as a physical space, but one dream within an Infinite Mind.

<p>
	Careful! Perception is not actually happening via the brain or the eyeballs. Perception as it is commonly understood is not really happening at all. It's a conceptual scheme you're imagining. BEING is what's really happening, not perception. Perception is BEING co-opted by ego/devil.
</p>

<p>
	Without the ego, perception does not occur. But this doesn't mean that colors and sensations vanish, they simply get recontextualized as something other than "my perceptions".
</p>

<p>
	The very notion of "perception" is already infected with ego because it assumes that perceptions are things which happens to you through your nervous system. This is not actually true. Perceptions are not caused by the nervous system. You merely imagine they are. In fact, you imagine your entire nervous system. "My nervous system" is a sneaky metaphysical construct which you use to ground your sense of reality.
</p>

<p>
	It would be helpful to stop believing in perceptions or a nervous system.
</p>

<p>
	You must completely unground your sense of solid reality. Your mind must become so free that you cannot even tell what a human body or a coffee table is, because those are all conceptual things. You must even forget that you are on a planet Earth or inside a physical universe, since those are all conceptual projections which are grounding the ego.
</p>

<p>
	You must reach a point where your entire sensory field is free of all conceptual interpretations or groundings. At this point, you will not know what anything is. You will look at your hand and not even recognize it as a hand. You will not know what "hands" are. Because "a hand" is actually a conceptual construction. You actually have no idea what that thing called "a hand" is. Even to call it a "thing" is already incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	This is extremely tricky and subtle stuff. I cannot stress that enough.
</p>

			my immediate and primary goal is to manage my general fear, insecurities, to be able to better handle uncertainty, to better manage resentments I hold against people, and to move away from my ego (as I understand my ego to be). To move away from animal instinct behaviour. I want to be cool, calm, and collected. Kind to others. Forget myself. Get outside my own head.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	And how is it you are going to achieve that when all of your fear is grounded in duality?
</p>

<p>
	Nondualty is not an ideology, theory, or even a worldview. It is the very nature of yourself and existence. So long as you are operating from duality, you will never be able to overcome fear, master your emotions, or move away from animal behavior. Nor will you ever be cool, calm, collected, or happy. Because all of that is the foundation of being an separate ego self.
</p>

<p>
	You're not appreciating yet how deep all of your emotional problems go. They are not something you can just solve with a few self-help techniques. To resolve those issues requires that you literally experience your own death because death is what you're running away from.
</p>

<p>
	Nor will you be able to resolves those issues within the materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The benefit to you of nonduality is that you will experience what it means to live for the very fist time in your life. Everything you've done up to this point was a sick joke. You have never actually lived yet.
</p>

<p>
	The way life works is: you only get what you give.

<p>
	Goovy!
</p>

<p>
	It's not that the machine elves are playing your life though. They would not interfere with a human's free will. That would be improper for a highly conscious being to do, defeating the whole purpose of incarnation.
</p>

<p>
	Also, reincarnation is more complex than simply becoming a machine elf. Free will would also be exercised in the reincarnation process. Think of it more like this: You are deciding who you want to be based on what you need to further evolve your consciousness. Becoming a machine elf would make sense IF one has fully exhausted the lessons of being a physical entity like a human. I would guess that most humans will not become machine elves because they still have much to learn about being human.

<title>How do I approach this girl who is in a lower grade than me?</title>

Tell them a funny story or something like that. Or ask them some opinion opener like, "Hey girls, I need your opinion on something..." and then think some interesting topic to ask them about like: "Does it count as cheating if my friend has a girlfriend but he's texting other girls?"
</p>

<p>
	Something gossipy like that is good.
</p>

<p>
	Then you can focus more on chatting her up individually. "Hey girl, you look like the biggest troublemaker of this bunch. It's the quiet ones which are the biggest troublemakers. Hey, has anyone told you yet how beautiful I am? ;)"
</p>

<p>
	The biggest secret for attracting girls is simply to learn to be more social. Practice starting random conversations with strangers.
</p>

<p>
	It's hella hard to build attraction through social media. Your odds will be much higher in person where you can charm her a bit with words. And it will build better charming skills for you.
</p>

<p>
	In school girls most get attracted to the guys with the most social status. Being a loner is not helping your cause. It'd be better if you built a circle of your own friends. This shows you're a somebody. Then your odds will improve.

<title>Messed up because of scarcity</title>

<p>
	Sounds like your neediness spooked her away. Or she just wasn't that into you. Sometimes a girl will lose attraction for you after the first date because she doesn't quite resonate with your style.
</p>

<p>
	But if you did 3 whole dates and made out a bunch of times, clearly she was into it. A girl will not make out with you unless she is interested in sleeping with you.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, my rule of thumb is, if a girl is willing to go on a first date with you at all, she's already accepted that you are fuckable. She would never agree to go on a date with a guy she thought was unfuckable.
</p>

<p>
	So ALWAYS assume it's ON at day 1! Never doubt whether she wants to sleep with you. Always assume YES! Just maybe not on the first date. But by date 3 you should definitely close it. Of course if she tells you No! then you stop.
</p>

<p>
	If a girl is into you she responda to texts quickly and eagerly. Often within minutes. Days between texts is a horrible sign. 3 day+ between texts and she might as well be dead.
</p>

<p>
	Girls will NEVER reject a guy explicitly. They will always just delay and ignore or come up with lame excuses. You have to get good at reading between the lines and suss out when she is wasting your time with endless delay tactics.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Why not do some meditative practices and investigate actuality?
</p>

<p>
	Idle theorizing is not what this work is about and you will never reach Truth that way.
</p>

<p>
	You must discipline the mind to stop speculating about things you don't have direct experience of.

			On the topic of UFOs, I've seen them personally. Was camping in the deserts of Eastern Washington around 2004. Saw what looked like a satellite in the atmosphere. Then it stopped, which is impossible, satellites can't stop. It stayed still for about 10 minutes, did a cork-screw, then shot across the sky in a millisecond. Over the course of the night, I saw about 6 UFOs in the sky doing impossible things. Me and my GF watched them all night. The next day, we saw on the local news that there were many reports of UFOs in the local area.

<p>
	Literally tens of thousands of people report seeing aliens.
</p>

<p>
	Also, aliens don't have to be limited to the physical universe, since the physical universe is merely a dream.
</p>

<p>
	You have to really appreciate that if extra-dimensional non-physical aliens were a thing, this would completely upend all human beliefs, so of course it will be denied until the bitter end at any cost. Do not expect mainstream cuture to deliver aliens to you on a silver platter on the evening news. It will be denial, denial, denial.
</p>

<p>
	People so easily forget that mainstream culture is not in the truth-seeking business, they are in the bullshit-fabrication, sales, and the saving-their-own-asses business.

<p>
	Some of you guys keep forgetting that this has nothing to do with me. I could be a murder and nothing would change for you other than your judgments of me. The things being pointed to are independent of me.
</p>

<p>
	If you expect me to be some special holy guy that's your problem right there. Technically I am holy and Good no matter what I do, because God doesn't judge itself. And of course so are you.
</p>

<p>
	Focus on your work, not my personality or flaws.
</p>

<p>
	If I was flawless you would start to worship me and that would be the most distracting thing for your own growth.
</p>

<p>
	See, the game is this: when the teacher shows flaws, all energy goes in judging him. When the teacher is perfect all energy goes in worshipping him. And in both cases you avoid your own inner work. This is by the ego's design. Anything to avoid the work.
</p>

<p>
	The wise student ignores the teacher and quietly applies the teachings on himself. No flashy stunts. No drama. No gossip. No debunking. No trying to get inside the teacher's mind. No arguing. No kissing up. No trying to get attention. Just application and results. If the teacher gave you bad advice you will discover it in application.

	A closed mind is an easy thing to trigger. It's so fragile it needs to debunk everything that's not its own.
</p>

<p>
	It's a form of intellectual insecurity and weakness.

So you're begging the question. You're using direct experience to ask whether you can trust direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Name one thing which is not a direct experience. You can't.
</p>

<p>
	Direct experience is actually prior to trust.

You are the player of the game. So yes, there are rules of course, but you have a say too, since you are a part of creation.
</p>

<p>
	You already hold that everything which happens obeys certain rules. This you call the physical world. You can't just turn into bird and fly away. Limitations are imposed upon you at all times as a human.

	Lol, that's the rub.

<p>
	You are God playing a devil. So unless you decide to stop being a devil, and accept yourself as God, you will be a devil.

<p>

<p>
	Since you are God you have infinite power to deny that you are God. And that's what you're so busy doing. You don't like the things I say because it interferes with your denial process.

<p>
	That doesn't mean it's free of corruption and falsehoods.
</p>

<p>
	Since God creates all falsehoods too.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is distinguishing the truth from the falsehoods.

<p>
	I just want to caution you guys once again of the extraordinary subtly and depth of this work.
</p>

<p>
	There is no more advanced work for human beings than this. So watch your step. Don't think you can just barge in here, watch a few videos, and figure out all of life. Not. So. Fast! There are traps! Thousands of traps.
</p>

<p>
	If you want very deep understanding you better be ready for some very deep and careful study.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to appreciate the things I talk about unless you read at least 100 books. But even that is still just the beginning of this journey. There is no deeper or more challenging human endeavor than holistic, stage Turquoise+ spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	But also none as rewarding.
</p>

Otherwise they could not occur. You can't make GTA do anything which isn't already coded into it, by definition.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the programmers themselves do not have a full understanding of all the possibilities they coded, because the possibilities are infinite. They'd have to have an infinite mind to know that.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, you'd have to play an infinite number of GTA sessions in order to fully know what GTA is. So no one actually knows what GTA is other than God, who has played through everything everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	That's what omniscience is: the state of all possible unfoldings of reality unfolded in zero time.
</p>

<p>
	From God's ultimate POV, everything which can happen has happened because it is outside of time. Everyone is just one singularity, like a tiny seed. Except this is an infinite seed which holds all possible universes. Every video game that could ever be made exists in that seed. And every object that could ever exist.

<p>
	God is fully actualized at all times. What appears to you to be a process which takes time (people being born & dying) from God's POV has all happened in less than on trillionth of a second. Actually in zero time.
</p>

<p>
	Everything that will ever happen in the universe has already happened from God's POV.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity was fully actualized in zero time for eternity. But for a human to be a human, it must appear as though infinity is slowly unfolding. In truth it exists as folded & unfolded simultaneously because there isn't a difference between the two at the Absolute level.
</p>

<p>
	Think of a video game cartridge which already has all the possible gameplay sessions coded in it at once. In a sense, a video game is just an infinite possibility space. Every time you play it, it is different. But all the possible paths are already there baked into the cart. There's nothing you can do which will "surprise" the cart. In a sense, the cart "knows" all. You just have to tell it which paths you want to take.
</p>

<p>
	God is the entire cart AND all the individual gameplay sessions which can be played. The two are actually identical.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard for the mind to understand or appreciate such an abstract point from the outset. You have to get deep into the work to appreciate that the snake will eat its own tail.
</p>

<p>
	The work is self-undermining, as any truthful teaching must be, because reality is groundless. So no teaching can actually become a solid ground. As soon as it does, it's a false teaching.
</p>

<p>
	I explained this long ago in my epistemology episodes. But hardly anyone takes those episodes seriously enough.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of reality is such that it cannot ever be pinned down. Anything you say it is, it also isn't, and it is also more than both. That is the nature of infinity.

<p>
	The point of all of my pointers is that they will eventually undermine and devour themselves, like a snake eating its own tail.
</p>

<p>
	My goal is to take you on this amazing journey through your mind, for years, until one day you have an awakening so deep and so profound that you say: OH-MY-GOD! It's all NOTHING! Everything Leo was talking about was just a giant cosmic divine circle jerk which I created for myself in order to realize the fully glory of myself as God. OH-MY-GOD! But why was all this necessary? To show you the enormity of your own mind.
</p>

<p>
	Of course none of it is necessary. I just like exploring the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Don't think of my teachings as logical proofs. They are poetry and art.
</p>

<p>
	All we're doing here is celebrating the profundity of yourself as God.

			What about all the detailed statements you make about Absolute Truth in your videos.  Are those just mental scaffolding, yes or no?  How are all those detailed claims like just pointing to Absolute Truth?  You seem to want to have it both ways.  You want to point and you want to talk about it factually.  I think this is a problem.  It's a case of having your cake and eating it too.  Am I right?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said, some ways of speaking about the Absolute are more "accurate" or "better" than others. This is a relative matter. It's a matter of fit between teacher and student. You might resonant more with the teachings of someone very different from me. I present things in a way which I feel is modern and appeals to ordinary folks on Youtube in the 21st century.
</p>

<p>
	Those detailed claims are still pointers. Like I could make very detailed claims about New York City to you, but none of them are the same as New York City itself. When you reach NYC itself, you'll see that my pointers were "correct" in many ways, but also not at all the same as NYC. Pointers are poetic devices which capture the essence of a thing.
</p>

<p>
	Try to describe the smell of a rose in words. You see the problem? Your words will never be it. But some words are better than others. If I wrote: "a rose smells like rotten fish" << that would be bad poetry. If I wrote: "a rose smells delicate and soft like a baby's bottom" << that's much closer
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as literal understanding. All understanding is poetic.
</p>

			But you've made numerous and specific claims about the Absolute that not everybody who has claimed to "know" the Absolute has made or endorsed by any measure.  Most people believe that Truth cannot be expressed in words.  You've used a lot of words to describe Truth very specifically.  Surely this is not some cannonical Absolute Truth that you're talking about -- this is your version of it, your twist on it.   Wouldn't you agree?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said above, the mind will understand and speak of the Absolute in a thousand different ways depending on culture, era, brain type, personality type, past lives, genetics, language, etc. You must distinguish the Absolute itself from anything said about it. Anything said about it is always poetic, we might say. There is no one right or wrong type of poetry. Although some types are "higher" or more "truthful" than others. Not all poetry is equally good or equally effective at pointing out the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Which poetry you prefer will be relative to your mind, your ego, and your needs. If you are an atheist, poetry about God will not inspire you to discover the Absolute. You will prefer more scientific like maps and models. So when I speak of God, that turns a lot of atheistically-minded people off. But this cannot really be avoided since what they refuse to admit is God. And God is the most accurate word for it.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind that there are many facets and degrees of depth to the Absolute. So not every awakened person has realized all the facets and degrees. So they may speak of one facet but not the other. This problem is called the 5 Blind Men And The Elephant (google it). Very, very few people have seen the entire elephant fully.

<p>
	Every word that comes out of my mouth is mental scaffolding.
</p>

<p>
	But beyond that is Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	It I cannot speak because I am it.
</p>

<p>
	No one can ever speak Absolute Truth, they can merely point to it.
</p>

<p>
	My teachings are "true" in the sense that they do a decent job of pointing you towards Absolute Truth. But they are not it. But also they are!
</p>

<p>
	That is the divine paradox. You should expect a strange loop here due to the self-reference problem.
</p>

<p>
	Since you ARE the Absolute Truth, you cannot think it or speak it. Absolute Truth is prior to thought or speech, yet it is also not separate from them. Because Absolute Truth is total ONENESS.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you saying this?

<p>

<p>
	It's not a thesis. It's Absolute Truth!
</p>

<p>
	See, the reason you have a hard time accepting this is because you still hold Truth as a mental thing. It isn't. If it's a mental thing, it isn't Absolute Truth. Once Truth stops being a mental/conceptual thing for you, once you BECOME THE TRUTH, there cannot be any more doubt, because doubt is a mental thing.
</p>

<p>
	Doubt is actually fear and delusion.
</p>

<p>
	God does not doubt itself. Other than via the devils it creates. It's the devil who doubts.

<p>
	Haha. Of course!
</p>

<p>
	It cannot be otherwise. You must stop looking at the finger and look at the moon. You are still operating at the literally symoblic level, confusing map with the territory.
</p>

<p>
	The Tao that can be named is not the Eternal Tao. And yet we still call it the Tao and write books about it.

<p>
	Absolute Truth is Absolute. So of course it's certain.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox of being totally openminded is that you will eventually reach a point where you 100% Absolutely Without-A-Single-Doubt understand Absolute Truth.

<p>
	The two are deeply one.
</p>

<p>
	God gives you guidance if you ask for it and listen carefully to your highest thoughts and feelings. Your highest feelings are God speaking to you. Or rather it is you reconnecting with the Goodness of God.
</p>

<p>
	But also, suffering IS deep guidance. You may not like it but suffering shows you the way to God.

<p>
	That is what I've said from the beginning.

<p>
	The Truth cannot be spoken. And yet I must speak it.
