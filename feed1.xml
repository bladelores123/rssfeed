</p>

<p>
	So I will no long bother explaining it to you. You must do the work. I spoil you with way too much explanation. It makes you weak and lazy.

<p>
	In the end, the only thing you will ever discover are deeper aspects of yourself. There is nothing but SELF here.
</p>

<p>
	But there are an enormous number of aspects of Self and degrees of comprehension of Self.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt that self-inquiry will be sufficient for most people to reach all those aspects and degrees.
</p>

<p>
	Healing and purifying the body & mind is important for most people I feel.
</p>

<p>
	Self-inquiry is great, but there is also more to this work than merely awakening.
</p>

<p>
	My approach to this work is extremely broad. Far broader than any orthodox teaching you'll find in Buddhism, Advaita, yoga, or any other school.
</p>

<p>
	Russia's a mix of Red, Blue, and even Orange.
</p>

<p>
	The reality of any country is far more complex than any one color. You have to consider specific regions, cities, peoples, and parts.
</p>

<p>
	The overall corruption problems, oligarchy, and Putin's totalitarianism is why I put it at Red.
</p>

<p>
	Culturally and religiously there is a lot of Blue. In the business sector there is some Orange but also lots of Red mafia style business.

<p>
	Randomness is actually pure noise.

<p>
	Noise is the opposite of information.

<p>
	Of course randomness/information is a duality imagined by the Infinite Consciousness.

But this physical world is not random.
</p>

<p>
	In a truly random world there would not be much interesting going on. Sure, God could imagine such a world, but so what? It's just one boring dream in the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	See, if you're a great writer, you don't write books of random letters. You could, but it's a waste of your time and genius. Maybe you do it once, but then you move on to greater things.
</p>

<p>
	You have the power right now to write a book of random letters. Ask yourself why you don't do it.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You can look around the room and love any object you notice. Or love the room as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter whether you do it or don't. The room is still made of Love.
</p>

<p>
	You can even hate the room.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to notice love or feel love for Love to be the substrate of everything. In the same way that you don't have to think about atoms or feel atoms for atoms to do their job. If you see an atom in a microscope, that's a bonus, but it doesn't really matter from the universe's perspective.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why you can deny Love, and it doesn't bother God one bit. The denial of Love is itself but one more instance of God's Love!
</p>

<p>
	God is way beyond all that.

</p>

<p>
	It's all possible paths because time/space are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	This novel is not just one tale. This novel includes every possible story that could ever be told. And again, these stories are not linear. They are co-written by an infinite number of authors.
</p>

<p>
	It is TOTALITY!

	Imagine a writer thinking up a novel. Except this novel is infinitely long, infinitely complex, infinitely deep, and every character in it plays a role in writing it. Since the writer is infinite he splits himself apart into an infinite number of sub-writers to accomplish the job.

	Fair enough. I could have been a bit more technical in my discussion of suffering. Suffering is a deep topic.
</p>

<p>
	There will be a video on suffering in the future, as it's an important topic.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You are not appreciating yet just how relentless survival is. Survival dominates EVERYTHING in life. It's almost impossible to see beyond survival. Almost.
</p>

<p>
	I suggest to you that you do not deeply understand survival, and that should invest more time observing it and contemplating it in action.
</p>

<p>
	Look at your hand. That hand is an example of being.
</p>

<p>
	You must ground this work directly in what's right in your experience. Not abstractions.
</p>

<p>
	Being is the "stuff" that everything is. That "stuff" is consciousness.

<p>
	Yes, indeed, populism (aka, democracy) is a good thing. The problem is when right-wingers get a hold of populism. They turn it into ethnocentrism, a la the Nazis in WWII. Trump's populism is a fake populism because of course he doesn't give a shit about fixing systemic income inequality. He's using populism to create a culture war. This is a perversion of populism, which is supposed to be about increase democracy. But the culture war against the SJWs has blinded the right wing so much that they cannot see that democracy is being undermined. While the right wingers satisfy themselves on hating the SJWs, they overlook how the rich are just using this distraction to get richer. The right has misidentified the problem as globalist elite liberals, when in fact the problem is the systemic inequalities of the capitalism status quo. But right wingers cannot see this because they are traditionalists who blindly defend the status quo even if it harms their economic self-interest.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is the status quo needs to change. But conservatives, by their very nature, do not like change. They want to keep things as it was in "the good old days". But because society evolves we cannot ever go back to "the good old days", and they were never really good to begin with for many people. Conservatives create a fantasy/myth of the good old days and deny the reality of a rapidly evolving society. It's no accident that many conservatives deny evolution. They really don't like change. They want the safety of the past. But this cannot happen in an ever-globalizing world. We cannot go back to living as individual isolated nations. The world is too interconnected via technology & trade. The solution is to embrace change and take conscious control of it, rather than letting it unconsciously blindside us. What we need is proactive government, but we aren't getting it because conservatives have demonized proactive government as "big government", "communism", "government overreach", "world domination by liberal elites", etc.
</p>

<p>
	What we need is FDR style government that makes massive investments in domestic improvements and big picture coordination, similar to what we had for the space race. Government can do amazing things like moon landings if they are properly funded and given a clear vision. This requires good leadership.
</p>

<p>
	You will have to be proactive and take responsibility for making it practical. Academia is not known for their practicality.
</p>

<p>
	You need to have a vision for what you want to create, beyond just getting a degree. A degree means shit. What do you want to create for the world? That is the key question.

<p>
	I think psychology is pretty decent. Of course it's scientific. It's a science! People do serious research in that field and that's important.

<p>
	Of course it would be highly valuable to scientifically study & validate various yogic truths. We need a lot more scientific research into spirituality.

<title>Zizek On Trump</title>

<description><![CDATA[

People are free to define these terms however they want.
</p>

<p>
	I would say progressives are usually more left than liberals and progressives really care about making structural reforms to the system without too much concern for maintaining the old norms. One of those old norms is the dogma that capitalism is the only viable system and an absolute good.
</p>

<p>
	To me a progressive cares most about making serious changes to society to improve it. A progressive sees not making enough change as more dangerous than making too much change. Which is the polar opposite of a conservative. A progressive has a vision for how great society could be if we get our shit together and act big as a unit.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a good analysis of this issue:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/500i39m1RRE?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	I consider Kim, Zizek, Bernie, Warren, and TYT progressives.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely not Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi. They are centrists.
</p>

<p>
	Basically a progressive understands the inherent limitations and injustice of capitalism. Whereas everyone else is in denial about it.
</p>

<p>
	I consider myself a progressive, but I don't consider myself a socialist. I think there are some serious problems with socialism which socialists are in denial about as well.
</p>

His position is that he's very much against Neo-Liberal Third Way corporate Democrats such as Joe Biden, Hillary, etc. He wants serious progressivism / social democracy.

			In other words if it is for all intents and purposes an absolute that I have to follow some moral rules but morality itself is relative then by extension whether and if I have to follow any moral rules is also relative?

<p>
	Strictly speaking you do not need to follow any moral rules to awaken. Just like how you don't need to follow any rules to learn math. But if you are very wrapped up in acting from ego (being highly selfish) you will, in practice, not likely ever awake.
</p>

<p>
	So all that Buddhism is telling you is: stop being a fucking devil for a bit so you have a decent chance to awaken. Stop your whoring, theiving, and hoarding. Not because it is evil, but because it interferes with meditation.

<p>
	I have a BA in Philosophy.

<p>
	Overall I was quite disappointed with it. So I gave myself a PhD in God. That solved the problem.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Awakening is not normative. You are not obligated to awaken. Awakening is not better than not awakening.
</p>

<p>
	So yes, Trump will not awaken, but there is no one in the universe to say that is wrong. In fact God loves Trump just as much as the Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	It is us humans who judge Trump because it affects our survival and we are self-biased in that sense.
</p>

<p>
	So we can rightly kick Trump out of office, but that has nothing to do with him being bad in any absolute sense. It is a relative matter.

</p>

<p>
	A Masters or PhD in engineering is much more functional.
</p>

<p>
	Philosophy in particular is not meant to be studied in a university. This preverts the whole point of philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do serious philosophy, get yourself a bag of mushrooms and DMT and start doing yoga.

<p>
	Why? It will mostly be a waste of time. You can grow far better on your own and save the the money.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason for a masters or PhD is if you want to be university professor. It serves no other function and it certainly won't help you understand Truth.

	We are not going to be discussing extraction methods or creation methods on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that extraction and creation puts you into a whole nother category of legal problems. You will be treated as a drug dealer, not merely a recreational user. So do not go this route.
</p>

<p>
	If you are living with your parents you should not be doing this stuff at all. Be careful and don't fuck up your life.

<title>Legalizing Psychedelic Substances</title>

<p>
	This is an important topic.
</p>

<p>
	Medically, psychedelics like MDMA and mushrooms will soon be approved by the FDA for clinical use. This will happen within the next 5-10 years.
</p>

<p>
	Weed legalization is important toward the ultimate legalization of psychedelics, so we need more states legalizing recreational weed, and we really need a federal legalization of weed. This might happen within the next 5-15 years.
</p>

<p>
	And then we just need the most progressive states like California, Oregon, Washington, NY, etc. to start legalizing mushrooms & LSD. This should start to happen in the next 5-20 years.
</p>

			Buddhists on one hand claim that you have to follow certain ethical rules to become enlightened and to be seen as enlightened and his argument is that there is no reason for that to be the case if enlightenment is only a spiritual shift. His example with the pills is used to as an argument that there is such a thing as enlightenment without adhering to moral precepts.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not so simple.
</p>

<p>
	Adhering to moral precepts is part of the path. It's hard to reach satori if one is a devil. Hard, but not impossible. And it's hard to live in alignment with satori if one doesn't adhere to some moral precepts.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the moral precepts serve as training wheels.
</p>

<p>
	Even when doing psychedelics, your trips won't go very deep unless your mind is pure enough. Giving psychedelics to a guy like Donald Trump will not result in his realization of Buddha nature because his mind is too impure. First his actions would have to change. He'd have to stop lying, stealing, cheating, manipulating, etc. Or at the very least cut back on them.
</p>

<p>
	Of course enlightenment does not require adhering to anything. It is total liberation. But in practice you'll never reach it unless you make an effort to be less egotistical.
</p>

<p>
	A spiritual shift is also an ethical & moral shift.
</p>

<p>
	If you complain that people are devils after enlightenment, just try to imagine how big of devils they would have been without it.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is expecting some kind of perfect moral actions from people. This is not possible because morality is relative. Zizek likes to moralize without acknowledging that his moralizations are constructed by his own mind. If you are digusted by Nazis and Stalanists, it's not because they are inherently disgusting, it's because your mind is doing it out of survival drive. That is a self-bias Zizek's mind projects onto reality. Zizek seems to hold people like Nazi's as an absolute evil or wrong-doing, but that it is not Truth. That's not how a Nazi looks after satori.
</p>

<p>
	Perfection is not something one achieves through good moral actions. Perfection is already the case. All one needs to do is attain satori to see it.
</p>

			With plugging of a breakthrough dose, is there any chance of freaking out or yelling/screaming? I'd like to do it in my room, but have roommates. Don't want to alarm them with a major freakout. If it's just a gentle trip full of insight, I wouldn't worry about doing it at home.

<p>
	Of course this will depend on you.
</p>

<p>
	Some people love to yell. Personally I never feel the need to yell. For me it's too profound for yelling. Silence is golden.
</p>

<p>
	The best idea if you have roommates is to rent a cheap motel room for the trip. You can probably find a room for $40 on the outskirts of town.

<p>
	5-10mg is petty low dose.
</p>

<p>
	But if I had to guess, the SSRIs will probably block most of dose regardless.
</p>

<p>
	It's not a scam. You're just not following proper tripping protocol.
</p>

<p>
	You are lucky something worse didn't happen.

<p>
	This is definitely NOT how my trips look like at all.
</p>

<p>
	I think that is very dangerous and unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
	There is no need for water when tripping other than if you're thirsty, which you shouldn't be. Just drink a bit before your trip.
</p>

<p>
	The dose there is also too high. That kind of dose would traumatize many people.
</p>

<p>
	You can achieve massive breakthroughs in a safe & gentle way through plugging.

<p>
	It's both, since infinite/finite is a duality. Depends on what state of consciousness you're in.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you think is finite is actually infinite at a high enough degree of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There is the human mind, and then there is Universal Mind. The human mind is just a partial form of Universal Mind, the way a finger is part of a hand. When mind becomes Universal Mind, everything becomes knowable.

		</p>

		<p>
			He says that consciousness is dependent on the body and ends with it, as opposed to Nothingness which exists regardless as the formless, underlying foundation to the world of form, but ultimately one with form.
		</p>

		<p>
			He says: "Some readers may be wondering why I say that Awareness is not the Absolute(...). If pressed as to whether or not consciousness is the Absolute, I would say, that, Mind is not Mind , yet neither is it no-mind. (...) In Nothingness, there is some degree of awareness present -it is not how most people imagine brain death- albeit unconditioned, object- and subjectless. The Consciousness (for lack of better word) of Non-Being is so subtle that the moment we try to reflect upon it to check if we are conscious, we are jarred back into 'bein' and into our ordinary dualistic consciousness. I hesitate even to call this experience 'pure subjectivity' as that invites a metaphysical position that I am not willing to support.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's right, God is Nothingness, and Consciousness is Nothingness too.
</p>

<p>
	The word consciousness is tricky. People use it in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	The way I teach, consciousness is the only thing there is. But the consciousness I speak of is not produced by any human brain or body. And it does not end.

	Your skepticism should be as big as your willingness to dig up the truth.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with you skeptics is that you love to talk a lot but do no research.
</p>

<p>
	Go read every book & article ever written on development psychology until your skepticism is satisfied.

<p>
	Just because you're in some state of no-mind or absorption doesn't mean you have insight into reality.
</p>

<p>
	Meditative states are not good enough here. You have to want insight. Which requiring questioning.
</p>

<p>
	You can bliss out in meditation all you want, but it doesn't mean you understand what's going on and why.

<p>
	My classifications are very loose approximations. It very much depends on which parts of the country you consider. No country is a single color. That's an oversimplification we make for sake of convenience.
</p>

<p>
	So yes, your classifications may be slightly different than mine.

<p>
	Again, it's tricky here. God's plan is so epic that it's hard for the human mind to comprehend. The plan is highly non-linear. It's not like a movie director planning out a movie. Rather God's plan involves creating creators and giving them freedom to creator. It's a sort of meta-plan. The plan is to allow as many beings as possible to experience being God. For this plan to succeed God cannot force you to do stuff. God has to allow freedom for experimentation, making mistakes, conflict, catastrophe, etc. Things are not set in stone. Everything is fluid, and yet it all works perfectly in the end. That's the genius of the design. Any fool can write a linear story. But how do you write a story which allows every character in the story to write his own story and not have it turn into utter chaos?
</p>

<p>
	See, since God is totally selfless, it is not interested in ruling over you. It is interested in having you rule over yourself. So you could know the glory of being God.
</p>

<p>
	God is like the ultimate massively multiplayer video game designer. How you play the game is in your hands. It's an infinite sandbox. The plan is that you make the plan <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

Do you notice differences between them such that some are better for certain purposes than others?
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If you haven't tried DPT, that's one of the most occult-like psychedelics I've tried. You could probably do some amazing stuff with it. It's highly visionary.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I'm not saying that cancer is acting out of some personal love that it feels. Rather, cancer is simply a byproduct of the entire structure of the universe, which is designed to maximize love. For example, God created you with the freedom to create things. You can create a cigarette and smoke it. Then you can get cancer from it. That is simply a byproduct of how you choose to live your life and what you choose to create.
</p>

<p>
	God doesn't mind giving you enough rope to hang yourself. This is how you learn what life is.
</p>

<p>
	Cancer is largely a creation of mankind. We created it with the food and chemicals we create. If mankind really wanted to, we could restructure society to eliminate 95% of cancer cases. God's top priority is not your comfort but your freedom. You are free to poison yourself and the planet. You are free to nuke the whole world. That's the fun of creation. God wants to see what you will create. Will you create heaven or hell? Either way is fine from God's POV because God's Love is unlimited. Nothing you create, no matter how horrific, can shake God' Love. God will Love it because God is all things and God is too conscious to hate itself. God is incapable of self-hatred, other than through human form. Self-hatred is only possible at less than infinite consciousness.

<p>
	It's tricky here because, remember, the future is imaginary. When you realize that, your question will sort of resolve itself.
</p>

<p>
	I have experienced omniscience. It is possible. But it doesn't work the way you imagine. It's not about predicting the future. It's about realizing that you imagine everything.

<p>
	Look at it from the POV of the tumor. That tumor is reproducing because it wants to live. Who are you to judge that the tumor is wrong? Do you see the self-bias in your view? Obviously you want your dog to live, but that's only one POV. You have to realize that reality does not merely revolve around what your ego wants. There is a much larger design which you are overlooking.

<p>
	With that said, sorry about your dog, and know that upon death your dog will melt into pure Infinite Love. So don't feel bad for it.

			As someone who has high functioning autism, I can say that I used to really close myself off from love (not as a child, but afterwards). However, one of the things that really changed for me was when I watched your “How To Be A Man - Part 2” episode where you talk about owning and accentuating our feminine qualities. I started getting more in touch with that this past year. Just last month, I became friends with a a girl. I can express all my emotions to her and she can really relate to them. We don’t judge each other and accept each other for who we are, but especially the flaws. She even opened up to me about how she is constantly suicidal. She was contemplating suicide one day; the only person she could open up to at that moment was me.

	The most important thing is not to act lovingly, but to have an awakening to what Love is.

			I am approaching 50 years of age. I have 1.2 lungs due to surgery for spindle cell sarcoma in 2010. I then was diagnosed with a non-related Carcinoma (different subtype of cancer) in my right kidney in 2015. Both were excized via laproscopy and knife (traditional surgery) respectively. I still live. My boxer dog died of Cancer a few years ago. Tumors all through her body. My wife and I were devastated. Her mother died of two years ago. Her father died of C.O.P.D. while we were living in his house taking care of him earlier this year. 3 months later my own dad died of a Glioblastoma (severe brain tumor) after slowly losing his mind. He used to be a Ph.D in History. Consciousness witnessed the total dissolusion of his "mind" (a nonexistant) as did us and his loved ones after attempting to keep his cath clean while he was on hospice. I moved out of my home and left all my worldly possesions to be my wife's father's full time hospice nurse, with no previous experience. Right after he died I had to help my mother with my dad. We survived.

<p>
	Not exactly sure what you mean.
</p>

<p>
	I try to have a full range of expressiveness. I'm not trying to act lovey-dovey all the time to fit some kind of stereotype of a loving person.
</p>

<p>
	But also I am still very much in the process of purifying myself. I'm nowhere near complete. As I eliminate various defilements I will appear more loving from your POV.

				Helping a person take responsibility

				Helping a person overcome addictions
			</li>
			<li>
				Helping a person stop complaining
			</li>
			<li>
				Helping a person love others and other things more.
			</li>

				Helping myself cut people who keep violating my boundaries out of my life in order to produce more labor of love for others.

	The chief behavioral commitment of Love is to act selflessly for the greatest good of the universe.
