			So this incarnation will happen again . Oh shit . I have been lately afraid of this idea . That I will have to experience all this suffering again ,forgetting who I am , forgettingÂ love again and againÂ ðŸ˜£ðŸ˜£.

<p>
	You will do it gladly. With love. Don't think of it as being the same stuck on a loop. You can make new choices each incarnation. It's like playing a video game. Each playthrough is different. Life's not a movie, it's a video game!

<title>The Point of Life is Really Twisted</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/34987-the-point-of-life-is-really-twisted/?do=findComment&amp;comment=427155</link>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1329-shiva/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="1329" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1329-shiva/" rel="">@Shiva</a> Firstly, yes it is strange-loopy since everything is one and you are talking about yourself here. The self-reference problem cannot be avoided here.
</p>

<p>
	But also consider:
</p>

<p>
	God's will is to give you free will. So you are free to be a creator. God watches as you create just to see what you as human will create. God loves anything you create equally much. But at the same time God desires that you re-discover the highest joy inÂ existence: the joy of being God! So it's a though God had a trillion children in order to give them all the greatest gift in the universe: to discoverÂ that they are all Gods!
</p>

<p>
	Do you see the sheer genius of the design? It's designed to maximize love! God's great gift to the world is himself! And the only way he couldÂ give you that gift is by making youÂ unconscious. So your unconsciousness is actually the highest form of love because it allows you to appreciate the possibility of awakening. You can't awaken unless you're alseep. God had to do it this way because he is giving the gift to himself because there is no one outside himself who he could give a gift to.
</p>

<p>
	So you'd be missing the greatest gift. But only for a finite period of time. Eventually every child wakes up. God rigged the game so no one can fail.
</p>

<p>
	Even the worst person ends up in heaven. That is God's love.
</p>

<p>
	What greater gift could exist in the universe than an infinite number of beings awakening to the fact that they are God? What greater purpose could exist? The purpose is INFINITE!
</p>

<p>
	It took God total Selflessness, Love, Goodness, and IntellectÂ to acheive this! He's not fucking around. He used his power in the most responsible way possible, thus creating the universe as you see it today. He used his power to create paradise! For all his children to discover that they have always beenÂ in an unlimited paradise!
</p>

<p>
	If you only knew the extent of God's love for you, it would kill you. Since this love is without any trace of self. And since you are God. At the very moment that you realized this total paradise, you would be so alone that you would have no one in the universe to share it with. So your very next idea would be to create some "others" to share it with. But the only way you could do that is by making them unconscious, since otherwise they would just be you.
</p>

<p>
	The greatest tragedy of God is that he is so great he cannot share his greatness with anyone but himself. So hereÂ we are.
</p>

<p>
	It tends to be ever-increasing. It doesn't make such sense for Albert EinsteinÂ to incarnate into a kangaroo. That would be a step down.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possibility that there are higher beings than humans that you can incarnate into after you've maxed out being human.

<p>
	Religion is not created by the mystic but by his unrealized, unpracticingÂ followers.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about me, it's about you! What will you create? Will you be a devil? Or will you actualize Godliness?
</p>

<p>
	Of course ego will come in and corrupt my teachings -- and all teachings. It cannot be otherwise. Wherever there is truth there is devilry not far behind. The devil will never allow a mountain ofÂ truth to sitÂ uncorrupted out in the open.

<p>
	You already have! You got bored with that and incarnated into a human. So here you are! And now you want to go back??? What's the rush? After you end all manifestation you will be bored and re-create your human self again a million times over. You'll keep doing this for infinity.
</p>

<p>
	The end of manifestation, beginning of manifestation, and the middle of manifestation are all ONE! There is nowhere to go because there is only one place in the whole universe: nowhere. And you're already there no matter where you are. Try as you might you cannot escape from yourself! Wherever you go, there you are!

<title>First Existential Trip Report - Reached Eternal Insanity - Please Help</title>

<p>
	Yeah, I've been there. Realizing God can be freaky. Realizing all humans are your own imagination can be quite freaky too.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is you need a solid theoretical foundation in nonduality to help make sense of this stuff. Otherwise you'll feel extra lost.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you study some nonduality books. See my book list for dozens of great ones. That's what helps me ground my trips the most.
</p>

<p>
	Of course everything you saw was true:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		You are God
	</li>
	<li>
		You are all alone
	</li>
	<li>
		All people are your own creation
	</li>
	<li>
		Society is a lie
	</li>
	<li>
		Reality is a lie
	</li>
	<li>
		There is nothing but hallucination, and it goes on forever
	</li>
	<li>
		There is no difference between sanity and insanity
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Haha! You've got it precisely backwards! What could be BETTER than an eternal hallucination? It's heartbreaking in the truest sense: it's so Good and Beautiful that the Love of it breaks your heart.
</p>

<p>
	Death by Truth. Death by Love.
</p>

<p>
	What you saw is just the tip of the iceberg. There just isn't any physical world. There is only whatever you (as God) choose to hallucinate. You're hallucinating this forum post right now. And it's great! How else could anything exist as anything other than a hallucination? You are me and I am you. The circle is complete.
</p>

<p>
	Your only problem is that you lack theoretical foundation to properly ground and interpret your realizations. And this was also your first time. The first few times are freaky, then you get used to it and enjoy it. Also what you're missing is the infinite Goodness and Love of God. Your ego as taken these insights into a negative direction. That is a distortion of the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	So give yourself some time to heal and integrate these insights. Then come back for more to really understand. You've only had a tiny glimpse so far. Not enough to fully understand what you saw. Many more trips are required.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is a radical thing. It's an acquired taste.
</p>

<p>
	YES! I've felt that insanity you hit upon. That's some freaky shit. Shows you the power of God's Infinite Mind. But also great after the fact! Sanity is overrated. <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can face these things. It's merely the Truth. And nothing could be more beautiful or lovely. Just understand that your ego-mind badly distorted what you saw. It corrupted the Truth with its own petty judgments. So your negative reactions are not truthful.
</p>

<p>
	You're right. It's way too much. It's Infinite!
</p>

</p>

<p>
	It could be helpful, but probably not enough by itself. You can't really shortcut the inquiry if you want to truly awaken.
</p>

<p>
	And telling yourself, "I am God" would only be effective if you had a few glimpses already of what God is. Otherwise you'll just be filling your mind with wrong ideas of God.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that you have to SEE in your direct experience that you are God/nothing. Believing it is not good enough.
</p>

How Will creates all of physical reality?
</p>

<p>
	Have you become conscious that you designed your physical body using your own Will? Can you look at your hands and see that you are designing them right this very moment?
</p>

<p>
	Will and Being are one. Try to get a hit on that.
</p>

<p>
	Have you got a hit on Infinite Intelligence? What is intelligence in its purest form? Notice that Infinite Intelligence is materializing every physical object.
</p>

<p>
	By what method does God create? By what method are you creating this world?
</p>

<p>
	Make sure that you take FULL OWNERSHIP of yourself as God! You are doing it all! Do not offload that responsibility elsewhere! This is very important! You must realize yourself as THE CREATOR. You are not merely a nobody. You are THE CREATOR!
</p>

<p>
	The world is your creation. There is nothing and no one outside of you who is creating it. Because ONENESS.

	Mystery Method is ridiculously out of date and cringy as hell.
</p>

<p>
	Your best bet would be RSD videos.
</p>

<p>
	Game without using routines or canned lines. You gotta be as natural as possible, so your game isn't game but your authentic personality on full display.

</p>

<p>
	Of course it isn't true in any absolute sense.
</p>

<p>
	But very practically, if you want to be a high value man, you gotta teach yourself to be a provider/boss/value-generator.
</p>

<p>
	Traditionally the man's role is to hunt and bring home the wild game. Not being able to do so will hit your self-esteem. Again, simply on a practical level. We're not talking about enlightenment here. Just advice for average guys, not woke masters.
</p>

<p>
	Teach yourself how to hunt. Not to please the woman or society but to empower yourself. Hunting feels good. Which is why males of our species play first person shooter games. Females don't play such games.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: Why shouldn't you be happy that your ex is having sex? She is experiencing love and joy. Your spiritual growth is to realize that by loving her for getting love, you actualize your own love. And thereby everyone loves everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate the power of this. Your job in this life is to love everything until it hurts. Practice generatimg love on her behalf.
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot feel love for those who are happy, that's a sign of how much growing up you've got to do.
</p>

<p>
	Love her and love yourself. Then from this loving place find a new girlfriend. Remember: You can love people without having sex with them or even seeing them.
</p>

<p>
	The key to love is that it is an unlimited resource. You don't need to hoard it or trade it or hold it back in reserve because your truest nature is Infinite Love!
</p>

<p>
	Think abundance, not scarcity.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is just a lack of love.

<p>
	To me it's not so rare because I've studied lots of various masters. They are all profound in their own ways. If you have not studied many others then Sadhguru will seem rare.
</p>

<p>
	But clearly Sadhguru is great.

<p>
	That's untrue.
</p>

<p>
	Don't assume it cannot be known. It can be known.
</p>

<p>
	Both are true:Â you can reincarnate and God has already experienced everything. This is not a contradiction.

<p>
	Whether you reincarnate and as what you reincarnate as will depend.

<p>
	If you could, you certianly couldn't explain how you do it via any conventional human paradigm of understanding.
</p>

<p>
	It would be a level of connection to God-consciousness beyond anything words could convey.
</p>

<p>
	I suspect it is possible. But only for exceptionally advanced yogis. You won't get thereÂ through self-inquiry.

<p>
	The problem is that's poison to your body and mind. And you're squandering a good opportunity.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you go toÂ Disneyland and rather than going on all the rides you lock yourself in the toilet.Â 
</p>

<p>
	Technically there's no problem. But it's also aÂ waste.

</p>

<p>
	I'm sorta semi-lucid but not 100% God-mode lucid. Which is what to me is the ultimate goal.
</p>

<p>
	Insight is important and good, peaks are good, but most importantly is the question of your minute to minuteÂ lucidity.
</p>

<p>
	I believe it's possible to be in full God-mode all the time.
</p>

<p>
	When you do 5-MeO it clearly shows you how unwoke you still are. It's a whole order of magnitude more wokeness than ordinary life. It's clear to me that such total wokeness is possible. And I certianly don't have that yet.

<p>
	Sometimes it can. But meditation is usually more focused on hitting higher states of consciousness rather than addressing buried psychological baggage.
</p>

<p>
	There are many layers to your mind which root many of your personal problems which meditation is largely unconcerned with.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of Zen masters and enlightened masters can still have significant shadow.

		</p>

		<p>
			how do you accept your friends viewpoints, knowing that they are wrong. i've said a few things to my parents and its like talking to a brick wall, not that i expect any less ofcourse. but i'm starting to build up this energetic feeling that by the power of grace, everybody in the world finds out enlightenment is an actual thing and i can then point to my parents and say i fucking told you so! this is what i meant the whole time! even imagining the situation is giving me joy beyond belief as opposed to them thinking that i've personally been brainwashed and without logic, blindly accepting what others say like the fact i am god etc..Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			like its obvious that you probably don't talk to them about how you see reality (those that don't know) not like fucking ralston lol, my real question is how do you tolerate what they say and be bothered to reply with an answer that you may know not to be true
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I mostly keep to myself. I'm not a very social person. I am happy rolling solo most of the time.
</p>

<p>
	A few intimate friends and lovers are no problem. Discussing with them is no problem usually.

<p>
	Because society makes it easy, herding you into it like a sheep.
</p>

<p>
	Now you are on your own.
</p>

<p>
	You can actually learn much faster and deeper as an adult. But no one will motivate you. It's all on you.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, since you are now trying to move beyond the center of gravity of your culture, they will actively drag you down and discourage you from trying.
</p>

<p>
	So it's all on you twice over.
</p>

<p>
	Plus you gotta pay your bills, so it's all on you thrice over.

<title>Tips for integrating a not so pleasant LSD experience ? [Trip report + questions]</title>

It's not merely a matter of belief. Belief is not what creates your body, for example, but your bodyÂ IS a hallucination. So this process of creation is not as easy a beleiving whatever the hell you want and it appears.
</p>

<p>
	But if you are tripping on psychedelics they open your mind up so much that you can literally imagine a devil and see it materialize before your eyes. But this is not just belief. It's the machinery of Universal Mind which spawns physical reality. You cannot access this machinery easily in ordinary states of human conscious. Because your sense of reality must be maintained to maintain your human life. Your mind works very hard to create a solid sense of "reality" otherwise the game of human lifeÂ would be up.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is pervasive due to the ego's survival function and your belief in death. Growing up is all about learning to master your fear and negative thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Yes and no. Since God is all God ultimately creates all. Since you are God, you create all, including your own suffering.

	That's the trickery of nonduality. All formulations of it never quite capture both sides of it.

<p>
	Since you are God, you are the only authority that exists. So whatever you hold as the case becomes your reality. If you think you deserve punishment, you will get. If you think some adult is your authority figure, that becomes your reality. If you think you are crazy, you become so.
</p>

<p>
	What the psychedelic ultimately shows you is that all of reality is your own projection. So be careful what you think or you just might get it. If you think scary thoughts you will get scary experiences. That's how people create their own living hells.
</p>

<p>
	Such "bad" trips as yours are all part of the journey. It was exactly what you needed at this time in your life. The next trip will be different if you've learn your lessons.
</p>

<p>
	Such "bad" trips are necessary to teach you the importance of respecting these powerful substances. The lesson is: these are not toys. So next time you will be much more careful with your protocol, attitude, and setting.

<p>
	Ironically practice can get in the way of spirituality in the same way that religious church rituals do.
</p>

<p>
	Yet at the same time, without serious practice you will not getÂ very far.
</p>

<p>
	That's what makes this work so tricky. It's a catch-22.

<p>
	This was explained in my last Spiral Dynamics video.
</p>

<p>
	No, you cannot map types to stages. Types are an independent axis. Just like how male/female cuts across all stages equally. Do not try to map males to Red or females to Green. Likewise with personality types.
</p>

<p>
	And stages and types are not the only axes. There is more. See my vid about that.

	If you are God, the question then becomes, what do you want to create? Because creation is the only game in town and there is no one but you to tell you what you should create, so whatever you decide is worthwhile to do, is what you as God will create. If you decide that nothing is worthwhile to create, that will be what you created.
</p>

<p>
	If you decide to be an angle, that's how God created angels. If you decide to be a devil, that's how God created devils. If you don't decide anything and just follow the path of least resistance, that's how God created devils. Being a devil is the default condition. Being an angle takes deliberate intention.
</p>

<p>
	And so the world is exactly as it is. A perfect inevitability.
</p>

<p>
	That is not what's being said.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation can reveal the emptiness of suffering but that doesn't help those who are not liberated. Which is why helping everyone awaken is a big goal of Buddhism and all spiritual traditions.
</p>

<p>
	The only way for the entire world to escape suffering is for the entire world to awaken together. That is exactly what evolution is moving towards: unity and love.

<title>why do you come back after you die</title>

<p>
	For the same reason people don't permanently die from a few samadhis during meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Your body/mind is not so fragile because its job is to survive at all costs. You are a survival machine which protects you against your own stupidities. The body cannot actually trust the ego to keep it alive, which is why it tortments the ego with pain, suffering, and desire. That's the body making sure the ego doesn't do something stupid that gets both of them killed.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Ego can certainly co-opt God for it own devilish purposes. That does not negate God in any way though. God is still there.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The biggest problem affecting the world is that people don't meditate.
</p>

<p>
	If every politician meditated and woke up, world hunger and poverty would be solved overnight.
</p>

<p>
	All material world problems are the result of lack of consciousness and unconditional love. If people were conscious that they are God's, there would not be war, theft, rape, murder, slavery, exploitation, corruption, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Look at Trump. The only thing that can cure him is meditation, which he will of course never do. So the world is as ugly as it is.
</p>

<p>
	What you don't understand yet is that all political problems are self-created by people like you. Once you realize that you will see how all these problems can be solved. You cannot solve these problems at the level of consciousness that created them.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying you should ignore poverty and war. Just the opposite, I am saying you should wake up and realize that you are contributing to them.
</p>

<p>
	Unconscious people are actually incapable of caring about ecology, poverty, inequality, and war. They only care about it when it serves their ego to do so. Thus nothing gets resolved because the care is not deep enough or all-inclusive enough. Egos resist equality because they are too threatened and scared by it. They are too busy hoarding resources for themsleves, thereby creating poverty, slavery, rape, genocide, and war.
</p>

<title>As GOD Why we can't creat any thing</title>

<p>
	Firstly, you CAN heal your body. Healing is an entire discipline. You can increase the heal rate of cancer through shear mind power. This has been proven by clinical science long ago. ThereÂ existÂ clinics which teach how to heal cancer with mind power. And of course it works. Not 100%, but you'd be surprised how effective it can be.
</p>

<p>
	There also exist millions of psychic healers who can help heal you. The shit Jesus did is not merely a myth! An exceptionally conscious mystic will have psychic superpowers that you can hardly believe. Of course it's not 100% perfect. Don't try to formalize it. You can't formalize psychic abilities within a materialist paradigm because they are immaterial and superconscious.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, since you are God, and you can create anything out of thin air, you createdÂ this human life where you get to experience limitation. You created limitation for yourself. You just forgot. So until you wake up you will be puzzled. After you wake up you will understand that you did this to yourself precisely because you have infinite power.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, by becoming more conscious your ability to create using your mind will increase significantly. You will not get 100% freedom because for that you'd have to stop being human. To be human is to have certain limits. But right now you are nowhere near the limits of what the human mind/body can do.
</p>

<p>
	Do not underestimate the power of the mind. The entire universe is mind-stuff. You just don't know how to access it. Humans are a very crude and underdeveloped species. And you are a very crude and underdeveloped human. So there's your answer.
</p>

So all your ideas and ideals fly out the window. You can tell yourself you're fearless but when the floor beneath your feet disappears, you'll be in for surprises you could not anticipate or prepare for.
</p>

<p>
	Faith and love are of course great things to bring into the trip. But you never know how twisting things will get. Sometimes a trip just goes hairy for no apparent reason beyond your ability to control it.
</p>

<p>
	If you trip long enough you will get some very hairy trips. The key is to go with the flow and for fucks sake never resist them. Surrender to the hairiness. That alone with grow you a lot.

<p>
	Yeah, that's why self-employment is so hard and most people just cannot do it. Because it takes serious vision and self-discipline to be able to lead yourself. Most people are sheep who suck on the tit of society. They need a boss just to tell them when to wake up, otherwise they would become vegetables.
</p>

<p>
	The self-determined life is not the easy life. The easy life is working at Starbucks for 40 years and then retiring without a single dream or deep thought about life.
</p>

<p>
	You need to have a serous over-arching vision and purpose to your life if you're gonna go it alone. You need to be a fuckin boss on yourself.

	Being a successful musician is not just about musical skills. You also need marketing and business skills.
</p>

<p>
	It may be necessary to keep your dentistry gig for now. But eventually if dentistry is not your passion but music is, you want to transition to place where your music can support you. That might take some years and some clever business scheming. You'd need to build a brand of some kind.

	Stick to the core principles of course. Flashy game is bad game. The best game is chill, friendly, and so natural it doesn't look like game at all.
</p>

<p>
	Seek to be totally natural, congruent, authentic, and humble. Natural, chill, and authentic works like magic.
</p>

<p>
	When you boil game down to its essence you'll discover it's just you being you to the hilt. But it takes A LOT of experience to reach that point.

<p>

<p>
	Of course not. Rather you generate a loving vision of your future. You imagine your highest future and feel that feeling. Then you go build it.
</p>

<p>
	You can't escape McDonalds by feeling shitty. You escape McDonalds by feeling inspiring about what you will create next.
</p>

<p>
	Use positive feeling as your launch fuel. Negative feeling is the devil sucking out your soul.

<p>
	Look at what JP demonstrates, not what he says. He says to take responsibility but then he makes a career out of blaming others for the world's problems: feminists, marxists, leftists, hippies, liberal professors, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Scapegoating 101
</p>

<p>
	Weak men use JP to blame women for their lack of sex and lack of manhood.
</p>

<p>
	JP does not yet realize what it means to pick up the cross of God.

<p>
	It requires LOTS of mindfulness practice.
</p>

<p>
	Consider taking a 10 day Vipasanna retreat. That will open your eyes to the power of body awareness in a way that you cannot presently imagine.
</p>

<p>
	You could spend the next 10 years just sitting on a couch and feeling your body. And you'd still not feel everything there is to feel there. The body is a very complex and subtle organic technology. It's more intelligent than any Western science can imagine. Every cell in your body has its own innate intelligence.

	Yes, you can claim to be a religious organization. But in this case, the money is not technically yours, it's the organization's. You can't use it for personal expenses. You must use it for organization business. If you pay yourself a salary you will get taxed on that.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a non-profit organization.
</p>

<p>
	I could claim Actualized.org as a religious organization. Because that's what it basically is. "Religous" here just means spiritual.

<p>
	I see a chronic problem on this sub-forum, which is young males who complain about lack of success with women and failing to take responsibility for their situation.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 rule of all growth and personal development is taking 100% responsibility for your situation. I know how hard that can be when you're struggling with women/sex. It feels very much like life is treating you unfairly and that it's the women's fault. Let me tell you right now: this is a total ILLUSION! It's not the women. It's not society. It's not post-modernists. It's not the Marxists. It's not the feminists. It's YOU!
</p>

<p>
	This is not me blaming you. This is simply how all personal development works. Whatever problem you have in life you must begin by getting honest with yourself how you created it. Sometimes this is difficult to accept. It's much easier to blame someone else, or even blame yourself (for being too ugly or too short or too introverted). I am not suggesting you blame yourself. Rather, take ownership of the fact that you are the creator of your life. Whatever is missing in your life, you can correct, but only if you stop blaming yourself and others.
</p>

<p>
	Be very mindful of how your ego-mind creates narratives which justify your sense of lack, brokenness, or inability to attract women. All of these narratives, justification, rationalizations, logic, "facts", scientific studies, proofs, etc are sneakily fabricated by your own mind! Your own mind is the enemy! Watch it like a hawk. Your mind will try to come up with reasons and excuses for why your life is unfair and how success with women is impossible. This is all horseshit! Do not believe your own mind here. Your mind is clouded by fear, insecurity, and neediness. That is totally normal and understandable, but you cannot resolve your problems from such a place. From such a place your problems will get worse as you start to blame the world and solidify your victim worldview with cherry-picked evidence, "science", and "logic". Be extra suspicious of "logic" and "science" here. There is nothing logical or scientific about your victim attitude or lack of success with women. It's purely about meeting the survival needs of your ego. Sex is a very powerful survival need which will drive your mind towards all manner of mental gymnastics to ensure that you get it, or at least feel better for not getting it.
</p>

<p>
	There's good news and bad news. The good news is: Your looks are NOT the problem! The bad news is: your personality, attitude, and mindset are terrible! The good news is, it's possible to change that. The bad news is, it won't be easy and you will resist it like the devil that you are.
</p>

<p>
	So what's the solution? Take ownership of your problem and commit to resolving it. For this you need faith and confidence in your ability to self-actualize. You must have enough hope and vision to see yourself get much better with attracting women. This is NOT a pipe dream or fuzzy thinking. The reality is that any man can become 100x better at attracting women if he really takes ownership of the matter. Yes, it takes serious work. But it's also highly worth it. Imagine that within 3 years you're able to attract pretty women and feel confident about yourself when it comes to dating. Isn't that worth the effort? It sure is. This is not a fantasy. I've done it, many men have done it, and so can you! Your looks are NOT the bottleneck, your mindset is.
</p>

<p>
	So what do you do after you've established this vision? You must do lots of research to educate yourself about how dating actually work (not how you think it works). Find videos, find books, buy online courses, hire a coach, take a bootcamp, take a workshop, etc. There are literally hundreds of excellent resources available online these days. Most of them are legit, not scams. Study them hard and then get into the field. Start talking to women. Start approaching women. Start flirting with women. Start being much more social.
</p>

<p>
	If you struggle attracting women I can tell you right now what your top problems are. It's not lack of money, looks, muscles, car, height, or dick size. Remember, attraction and dating is EXTREMELY counter-intuitive. It's works exactly the opposite of how you initially think.
</p>

<p>
	Your top problems are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		You live in your mancave and never go out! You must go out into social spaces where real women hang out.
	</li>
	<li>
		You spend WAY too much time online, indoors
	</li>
	<li>
		You spend WAY too much time on Youtube, Netflix, and playing video games
	</li>
	<li>
		You work too much
	</li>
	<li>
		You are never around cute single women
	</li>
	<li>
		You never start conversations with strangers
	</li>
	<li>
		You have terrible body language due to lack of experience
	</li>
	<li>
		You are not comfortable doing small-talk and being emotional and random in conversations
	</li>
	<li>
		You are far too logical
	</li>
	<li>
		You approach zero women on a regular basis
	</li>
	<li>
		You are terrified of approaching a women who you find attractive, talking yourself out of every approach
	</li>
	<li>
		You have terrible eye contact, you don't smile, and you don't project your voice properly
	</li>
	<li>
		You are crippled by fear and tongue-tied
	</li>
	<li>
		You are unable to start and sustain an interesting conversation with a human being
	</li>
	<li>
		You are disconnected from your body, your heart, your feelings, your emotions
	</li>
	<li>
		You have terrible self-image issues. You hate yourself, you hate how you look, you judge yourself way too harshly. You judge yourself just as harshly as you judge women.
	</li>
	<li>
		You have a bad sense of dress style and you don't groom yourself well
	</li>
	<li>
		You have no experience with physically touching women in a non-creepy way. You don't know how to rapidly physically escalate on a women without creeping her out.
	</li>
	<li>
		You don't know how women think or what they truly value in a man
	</li>
	<li>
		You don't know how to flirt and be authentic
	</li>
	<li>
		You are trying to be masculine in all the wrong ways -- fake masculinity
	</li>
	<li>
		You are needy, needy, needy
	</li>
	<li>
		You are terribly inexperienced
	</li>
	<li>
		You have no sense of passion or purpose in life, which robs you of confidence and masculine vitality
	</li>
	<li>
		Your attitude sucks: you whine, complain, bitch, moan, blame, and are so negative
	</li>
	<li>
		You think you understand life, reality, and how attraction works -- you don't!
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	So work on fixing all of that before you go blaming women. All of the above can be deliberately worked on and fixed.
</p>

<p>
	You need to learn how to be a real man. Being a real man has nothing to do with big muscles, big dick, or a fast car. A real man is grounded on the INSIDE. It's ALL about inner game! You need to cultivate that confidence. It doesn't come naturally. You must build it!
</p>

<p>
	80% of getting good with women is just actually being much more social. You need to deliberately re-structure your life so that you're automatically being more social. So that you're going out every weekend. So that you're bumping into new people constantly. So that you're making new friends all the time. This kind of re-structuring is very doable. You just have to be willing to change your lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
	And stop watching or listening to any of the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Jordan Peterson, MGTOW, RedPill, Incel material/forums/reddit
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	All of that is cancer of the mind. It's reinforcing your victim mindset and robbing you of your ability to change yourself.
</p>

<p>
	I've been where you are. I know it's tough. But hang in there, hold your vision, have hope, get to work, and things will dramatically improve for you. You will become a new person by the end of this journey and you will be so proud of yourself. You will become a real man, not some whiny JP fanboy.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 thing a real man does is take 100% responsibility for all his problems. A real man NEVER blames anyone, and certainly not women or feminism. A real man is a feminist. A real man fearlessly works on himself.
</p>

<p>
	So start right there! Start by fixing that.
</p>

Society rewards tons of "alpha" men. You can find thousands of examples which will blow your narrative out of the water.
</p>

<p>
	The meta problem here is that your ego is just spinning whatever kind of narratives suits it. There is no truth in such mental activities. This is not deep understanding of reality, life, gender, or society. It's ego games.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is constantly interpreting the world in such a way that you see precisely what most serves your ego and reinforces your existing worldview, no matter how fictitious it happens to be. Notice this. And go meta. Stop playing the game at that low level.
</p>

A stage Green Christian is exactly that. Foaming at the mouth Christians are not true Christians, they are fakes. So the irony is that Obama is a truer Christian than most Republicans.
</p>

<p>
	Did Obama dumb himself down a bit? Perhaps. I mean politics requires some degree of manipulating one's public image. That can't be avoided entirely.

<p>
	You are creating all of reality and your so-called physical body. But you are not aware of how.
</p>

<p>
	The more aware you become, the more stuff about yourself you will be able to change. Certainly you can change all the stuff you listed. Growing a third arm might be out of your human capacities. But you as God are imagining both your arms into being. There are just certain limits to being in our present human forms. Something has to stay constant to ground this life of yours until death. After death the limits drop away.
