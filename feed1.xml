<p>
	You should be able to clear that out with the antibiotics.
</p>

<p>
	Try doing 1 month of natural antibiotics, carnivore, and no probiotics. That should clear out a lot of stuff and end your bloating. Although there are no guarantees. Gut bacteria imbalances can be very challenging to fix, especially if you have some underlying health issues like auto-immunity.

<p>
	Usually a probiotic is not a good first option. It is safer to kill off the bad bacteria with antibotics, and then slowly add probiotics after your antibotics are done.
</p>

<p>
	Many probiotics contains prebiotics which will feed the bad bacteria. So you must avoid prebiotics until you kill them off.
</p>

<p>
	Doing a month of natural antibiotics is the best way to begin this process. But you have to take them seriously, 3x per day for at least a month.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you got some imbalance in your gut bacteria which feeds on sugars and carbs.
</p>

<p>
	That's why carnivore helps, but also isn't enough because you gotta kill the bad bugs.
</p>

<p>
	Your doc can prescribe some antibiotics or you can use natural antibiotics over a month like Allicin, grapefruit seed extract, berberine, oregano oil, and others.
</p>

<p>
	Probiotics could help, but they could also make things worse. Depends.
</p>

<p>
	Getting a SIBO breath test will tell you if you got SIBO, which is likely.
</p>

<p>
	God is no-self. God is Infinite Self.
</p>

<p>
	There is no contradiction here at all.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing = Infinity
</p>

<p>
	BUT!!! Just because you realize no-self does not mean you realize God/Infinity. It's easier to realize no-self than it is to realize God/Infinity. And there are many degrees of realizing God/Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know why you guys are so confused about these matters since this is basic nondual theory. There is nothing controversial here.

	You should be going out 3-4 nights a week for at least a year, every week, with the goal of doing 1000-5000 approaches.

<p>
	That's because she's testing you to see if you have balls or not.
</p>

<p>
	If you keep being a pussy she will lose all attraction for you. Sounds like it's already the case.
</p>

<p>
	You made her the prize so why would she sleep with a ball-less pussy man? No attractive woman wants such a man.

	There is no way I could teach what I teach without all the psychedelics I've taken. Even with 40 years of practice I would not be able to teach at my current level.

	Do not take girls into the club. Take them out of the club.
</p>

<p>
	Taking a girl into a club is terrible for logistics. You want to isolate her in quiet area to build rapport and begin seduction. It's hard to do that in a club. You need better date location ideas.

<p>
	1) You are being too needy
</p>

<p>
	2) You are making her the prize and she knows it. Stop making her feel like you are beneath her. She needs to feel that you are above her.
</p>

<p>
	You should have instead teased her: "Your friends are all imaginary" or "Your friends hate you". This sets the proper frame of you being above her. You did the opposite, making yourself look like a pathetic loser with no friends who is trying to get into her party.

(seeing from just how I write, you may know) I'm a very positive guy. This girl is hard man.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Let a few days pass without pestering her with your neediness.
</p>

<p>
	Then try to make her laugh a bit and then ask out for coffee or something like that. No clubs, no friends. Those are all obstacles.
</p>

<p>
	And stop putting her on a pedestal. You need to be cooler than her. YOU are the prize, not her. She should feel lucky to get a coffee with you. You've got it all backwards. Stop acting like a needy girl and start acting like a man.

			All sensations are "non-dual" in Nature, as in sensations in of themselves can't tell the difference between "God" or "poop" or "Awareness" or "Consciousness" or "Emptiness" or "Eternity" or "Love" Or "Intentions" "Matter" or "Mind" "Sober" or "Psychedelic Trip", "Time", "Space" etc

<p>
	Actually I disagree with this Vipassana approach. It's too reductionistic. I understand what you are saying: you can deconstruct experience into discrete sensations and so forth as Vipassana loves to do, and this can be very useful and liberating. But this is not the same thing as a holistic consciousness of what things are. It's the spiritual equivalent of saying that the physical universe is nothing more than atoms. And this not correct. There is an understanding beyond the sum of its parts. Which is precisely why Vipassana people are not God-realized. They don't know what God is because you cannot know God by breaking experience down into atoms. I would further say that you cannot know what Consciousness is that way either.
</p>

<p>
	There is a holistic infinite intelligence to Consciousness which is not any of its parts.
</p>

<p>
	God is not any one sensation, nor can it be said to be just another experience among all the other experiences, like a table or a dog.
</p>

<p>
	It is sort of like one who cannot recognize a human as a human because one insists on only seeing it as a bunch of cells. And what I'm pointing out is that something very important is missed in that approach. In fact, THE most important thing is missed. The goal should not be to atomize consciousness, but rather to interconnect it all infinitely to reach the highest understanding.
</p>

<p>
	People like Shinzen Young, who spent 40 years in Vipassana deconstructing sensations are not God-realized. I questioned him very carefully. He does not understand what God is. He's a sweet and beautiful man, but God-realized he is not, and I don't want you to get trapped in that way.
</p>

<p>
	People like Daniel Ingram also do not understand what God is -- even though Ingram has extraordinary technical meditative skill. Technical meditative skill is not good enough. Losing the ego is also not enough. What's missing is a holistic universal comprehension achieved by Infinite Mind. The Universe can grasp itself using its own Infinite Intelligence. And Intelligence is not any one sensation so you will never find it if you insist on only looking at individual sensations. It is the classic problem of missing the forest for the trees. Vipassana is like studying trees with a microscope and never seeing the forest.

<p>
	You haven't even done one approach. So don't kid yourself.
</p>

<p>
	For you, keep it simple: find venues in your town where women hang out and start approaching. Go out at least 3 nights a week and try to do 5-10 approaches per night.
</p>

<p>
	That's basically it. Nothing about this should break integrity.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not the money itself which will seduce you, it's the success and habits you develop to earn it.
</p>

<p>
	It's very hard to drop something you're successful at to go back to square one with something you suck at. And as you get older, starting from scratch becomes harder and harder. Because success requires laying a deep foundation over a period of many years, until something meaningful sprouts from it.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming a great musician requires a lot of deep foundation-laying. No amount of money or success in other fields will substitute for that. You can have $100 million, but your music will still suck.

	And what if flying in a plane has unseen karma for lifetimes and lifetimes?
</p>

<p>
	What if flying in a plane just seems wrong?
</p>

<p>
	What if God wants you to walk everywhere barefoot instead and you are violating his divine plan?
</p>

<p>
	Where do your "what-if" games end?
</p>

<p>
	If you are so worried about it, then don't fly in planes.

It can be hard to pull that off. But that's the strategy I used to bootstrap my LP. It works but requires serious commitment to your long-term vision and it will be painful as you work for years on something which is not your passion/LP just to one day fund your LP. And by the time you make enough money you may forget all about your original LP. It will be hard to say No to the money and go back to start your music from square one.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is: to make a strategy like that work, you gotta be persistent and hardworking like a motherfucker.

<p>
	Your understanding of death will deepen as your consciousness deepens. At first you will start to open up to reincarnation and stuff like that. But if you become ridiculously conscious you will realize that even reincarnation and past lives is imaginary stuff.

<p>
	Bible Thumbing Christians are obviously not more developed. Just because they dogmatically hold some beliefs which happen to correspond to some mystical truths does not make such people developed. A materialistic scientist is more developed in that at least the scientist is able to be non-dogmatic and to study reality from an empirical perspective. The Blue Christian isn't studying anything and isn't critically thinking about reality at all, he is just parroting words.
</p>

<p>
	Someone who plagiarizes Shakespeare is not a better writer than someone who writes decently but in his own words.
</p>

<p>
	Once you develop an empirical mind, you don't ever go back to being a fundamentalist. This is why Orange is above Blue. A stage Blue person does not yet understand Orange, but a stage Orange person correctly understands that Blue is fundamentalist and dogmatic -- and that this is deeply problematic.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get lost in the content, look at the structures. Be correct on the content is less important than being correct on the structure. The structure in this case is being dogmatic vs being empirical. Being empirical is more developed.
</p>

<p>
	Mysticism is superior to atheism, but atheism is superior to fundamentalist dogma.
</p>

<p>
	Compare the US Founding Fathers and The Constitution vs the theocracy in Iran. Orange vs Blue. Which is more advanced?
</p>

<p>
	You also clearly see that stage Blue politics is way more regressive and problematic than stage Orange politics. Stage Orange politics will be capitalism. Stage Blue politics will be racist and nationalist and theocratic.
</p>

<p>
	If you give stage Blue power, they will turn the country into a theocracy with their religion as king. There is no religious pluralism or tolerance at stage Blue. That only comes online at Orange. Stage Blue will force you to bend a knee to their God. There is nothing developed about that. It is better to bend your knee to a capitalist or a scientist.
</p>

<p>
	You guys keep imagining a future in which you will die. That is imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Death is way more radical than you think. It simply never occurs from God's POV. And your human POV is a fantasy which doesn't matter AT ALL.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing reincarnates when you are fully conscious. There is other realm. There is nothing else. This is it. Past lives and other realms -- it's all imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	The future and past simply do not have any reality whatsoever. You exist as the Eternal NOW. But the problem is you don't know how to stop imagining. You can't help yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The human mind cannot understamd death logically. Understanding death is a trans-logical thing. You basically become so present in the NOW that you can never die. You literally stop imagining your future death, thereby making it impossible.
</p>

<p>
	That's the biggest mindfuck of all.
</p>

<p>
	Death never happens. You just imagine it will.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	That won't show your toxicity.
</p>

<p>
	DMSA is what pulls out the heavy metals. Without it you're not measuring anything but the heavy metals in your drink.

<p>
	No. This will not happen.
</p>

<p>
	Stop making up excuses for not talking to girls.
</p>

<p>
	If you talk to 1000 girls, you'll see dozens of them will be interested in sleeping with you at the very least.
</p>

<p>
	Most girls are not as picky as you think. You just need to get a few of the basics down and at least 10%-20% of girls will start getting attracted. Of course you won't be able to close most of them simply for logistical reasons.

<p>
	Yup
</p>

<p>
	I mean... the most spiritual people don't even do meditation or self-inquiry. They simply have spontaneous awakenings out of the blue.
</p>

<p>
	I have met people who were born awake.
</p>

<p>
	I know people who have higher states of consciousness as children then you do on DMT.
</p>

<p>
	I know people who can see aliens and goblins and ghosts walking around the planet the same why you see birds flying around outside.
</p>

<p>
	You will never, ever reach their states of consciousness no matter how long you meditate. They are like a different species. They look human on the outside but they are not human on the inside. These are extreme outliers. There are people with perfect photographic memory or people who can tell you 6 digit prime numbers off the top of their heads. There is no technique to achieve that.

<p>
	This is a classic psychedelic effect. It's a sign of the loosening of consciousness into a more fluid, imaginative state.
</p>

<p>
	When I look at my couch pillow on LSD, I start to see a thousands eyes looking back at me. My consciousness first imagines them and then they materialize -- since physical objects are imaginary.

	In the same way that 1 = 1 or A = A is tautological. Everything = Love. The end.

<p>
	Do whatever you want. Just be honest with yourself why you're doing it.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not gonna play games with you guys about who is and isn't using roids. Bottom line is they can lie to you and you'd never know. I just assume every pro is using them and I'll be more right than wrong. I will certainly NOT be giving them the benefit of the doubt. They don't deserve it.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way you're going to maintain that low level of body fat without extreme, unhealthy, and unsustainable measures. To suggest otherwise is highly deceptive to newbies and wannabes. You are not going to look like that, so stop even thinking about it. And the only reason you're thinking about it is because it feeds your ego.
</p>

<p>
	I don't care if you build muscles. Just be honest with yourself about why you're doing it.

<p>
	God simply IS Love.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a mistake that God cannot be something else. God must be absolutely tautological. There is no option for it to be otherwise, which is what makes it so amazing and powerful.

<p>
	You really need to stop citing 1 in a 100 million genetic spiritual freaks as your baseline for how spirituality works.
</p>

<p>
	What works for Ramana will not work for the typical person.
</p>

<p>
	I have yet to meet a person who is deeply awake from self-inquiry. Perhaps a few masters who were already exceptionally spiritually gifted to begin with. The trick is not in your technique, its in your baseline state of consciousness. When your state of consciousness is correct, the technique is barely needed and takes little effort. When your state of consciousness is off, you can self-inquire for 40 years and get nowhere.

<p>
	Because it is way too threatening.
</p>

<p>
	Serious growth requires truth, and truth undermines all social institutions and holders of power.
</p>

<p>
	You can't even get Kansas to teach evolution. Never mind something like mindfulness.

<p>
	The most important thing for you is to move out of the country by any means possible.
</p>

<p>
	I would focus all my energy to hatch a long-term plan to move out, and then work towards that every day. You will immediately start to feel hopeful.
</p>

<p>
	Find some excuse/reason to move out: work, business, university, etc.
</p>

<p>
	If you develop serious skills in something valuable you should be able to find work abroad and move out. Work on marketable and high-value skills.

<p>
	Treating all of mankind as a holon is not some crazy idea. All of mankind has one common ancestor. Basic evolutionary theory treats man as a holon regardless of what island they live on.

	I jump to relativity because it's a deep feature of all these problems and debates. Once you really grasp relativity you will stop this kind of silly hairsplitting. You'll just be at peace knowing it's all a matter of relative perspective.

<p>
	Even Joe Rogan is on HGH and God knows what other drugs. It's all fake shit. The whole industry is designed to prey on insecure men's egos.

<p>
	Ego. Ego. Ego. Ego. Ego. That's what these people are posing for.

	They sell you these poses because you think it will make girls like you. But the truth is, deep down you hate yourself and you suck with girls for much deeper reasons.

<p>
	Of course that's the end goal. The challenge is how to get there. You cannot tell an inexperienced virgin to "just BE attractive".
</p>

<p>
	RSD has always taught to "just BE attractive", but they give you practical ways to work towards that if you suck. And almost all of us start out sucking real bad.
</p>

<p>
	When you are a newbie you gotta be a serious try-hard. It won't look natural. But over time it will become natural.

<p>
	Some parallels I supposed. Israel's strategy is to squeeze them out until they are left with nothing and its too late for them to get any land back. It's like a slow bulldozer strategy masked by public building projects. Like slowly building into your neighbor's land so when your neighbor notices its too late because you've already got a bunch of your stuff there and its too hard to move back.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if your neighbor had a deliberate strategy to take over your land by slowly planting more and more oak trees deeper into your territory while didn't have the power to cut any of the trees down. And finally he will plant the trees right under your house. You try to complain to the police but the police cannot do anything because "it's just trees".

<p>
	Possible, but not likely.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you do it, it probably won't be a deep realization.
</p>

<p>
	The first time it happened to be on a meditation retreat, sober, I realized the divine, but I did not realize I was God. That came much later.

<p>
	Of course he will not agree that his version of good is ego. But that's his ego talking.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that Good is an Absolute which cannot be defined and it has nothing to do with human ideas of what is good. Human ideas of what is good is ego.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Good is when you realize that even the Holocaust was good. And JP is not willing to go there. Whatever his ideas of good are, they will be limited and egoic. Absolute Good is an extremely radical thing that an ego cannot handle. Absolute Good is EVERTYHING: sex, money, family, and even murder.
</p>

<p>
	See, if I ask JP if Stalin is Absolute Good, he will say No! And he is wrong.

<p>
	However you want to define it. The definitions of holons are always relative and flexible.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I would challenge you on this. Your notion of constraint is too narrow and limited. Even uncontacted tribes are part of larger society -- even if they don't know it -- because larger society works around those tribes not to disturb them (or it disturbs them). An island is still part of an ecosystem and it won't stay an island forever.
</p>

<p>
	Again, this will be relative to how you wish to draw your boundaries and what kind of perspective you wish to take.

	This is a warning to anyone who is going to keep engaging in ideological or Game A activity in this thread: if you keep being obviously partisan and ideological, you will get banned.
</p>

<p>
	So watch what you post.
</p>

<p>
	If I see you embroiling people into a Game A debate, you'll be banned.

<p>
	If you are Israeli and have a horse in this race, think twice before unconsciously defending your country and watch your gaslighting.

<p>
	Game B does not mean both sides are equal or right.
</p>

<p>
	Israel is building internationally-recognized illegal settlements in decade's long effort to push out the Palestinians. This of course leads to outrage and violence. Israeli's long-term goal is ethnically cleanse the region of Palestinians through gradual resettlement until even a two-state solution is impossible. They don't want a two-state solution. They want to just slowly take over the land. This puts Palestinians in an impossible position which guarantees they will attack, which Isreal will then just use to demonize them and hasted the takeover of land. It's a very sneaky political game for land.

<p>
	Yeah, I see your point. You could frame it like that. That's basically one level of abstraction higher than money, sex, science, family, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Of course everything boils down to something like "good". But what JP does not understand is that his definition of good is actually evil. What he calls good is ego/survival. The ego defined "good" as whatever helps it survive. And survival is in a sense the one constant for all of life. But it is not the Absolute, survival is the greatest bias/illusion/delusion that keeps you from realizing God.
</p>

<p>
	Just because there are men living in uncontacted tribes does not in any way break the notion of men as a holon. A holon does not require physical contact.

	Again, folks, pay attention to how you are getting trapped in Tier 1 thinking, taking sides, and playing Game A rather than Game B.
</p>

<p>
	I expect a more elevated discourse from self-actualizers.

<p>
	Notice how your survival biases are skewing your politics in a selfish way.

<p>
	It can work but you have to be funny and confident about it. If you're just saying things in a needy and meek way to get her to like you, that will not work.
</p>

<p>
	The rule is: say things which YOU think are funny. Don't say things to impress her. Amuse yourself when you are with her.

	A high value guy is not about how much money you have, it's how strong your personality is. If you are humorous and non-needy, you become a high value guy.

<p>
	You are not thinking deeply enough about attraction. You think some funny line will make her attracted. That's a mistake. That's not how it works. Attraction is a holistic feeling she gets by being exposed to a strong personality.
</p>

<p>
	There is no magic line or joke that will make her attracted.
</p>

<p>
	You can get attraction with some girls within 3 seconds just by how you look at her, without saying a word.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is more about your vibe than what you say. The words you say matter little. What matter is how you behave and carry yourself around her.

			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

<p>
	If you can make her laugh, that's always a good thing. But also, do it in a way where you seem strong and powerful, rather than weak. She shouldn't be feeling sorry for you but respect you as a genuine man.

			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You don't need to be perfect for a girl to get attracted or even sleep with you. It's just that the better you are the higher you percentages will be. Girls will give you some leeway. They don't require perfection from you, so relax.

	For example, a cocky line I love to use is, "Hey, has anyone ever told you how beautiful [pause] I am?"

<p>
	Of course you will be needy until you start getting lots of success. In the meantime just try to contain the worse manifestation of your neediness. It's okay to be needy on the inside for now. Just don't show it to her. Don't act desperate.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You can think about her, but don't call or text her too much. Hold yourself back. Less is more.
</p>

<p>
	Work on suppressing all outer signs of your neediness. Inner neediness can only be cured by getting some results. But the girl does not know about your inner neediness, all she knows is what you express outwardly. So just hold your shit in.

<p>
	Download a metronome app for your phone.
</p>

<p>
	Turn on it on and follow every tick and tock with your mind. If your mind wanders, bring it back to the tick and tock. Keep doing that until your mind becomes focused and clear.
</p>

<p>
	Binural beats are also very good for just calming down a noising mind.

<p>
	That's a nice excuse to mask over the true reason's your doing it: to have a better self-image.
</p>

<p>
	You can develop some strength without bulging muscles. And you can get a satisfied feeling with moderate exercise. You don't need to be pushing giant weights.

<p>
	There is no evil. That is just your selfishness projected out onto the world. That's your shadow.

	Hamas is simply the equivalent of the Israeli military. It serves exactly the same function: self-defense of its people.

<p>
	I understand it at a high level. But I don't get myself involved with the nitty-gritty of dealing with it. How to deal with it is a complex and messy business which I have no interest in. Abnormal and dysfunctional psychology is a narrow specialization that requires lots of clinical experience to manage well. That's not my wheelhouse.

	Yes, of course. That's exactly what New Agers, psychics, healers, clairvoyants, mystics, and shamans do. Most of them are like that from birth, and they spend many years struggling with how to control, make sense of it, and put it to use.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The problem here is CONTEXT.
</p>

<p>
	Flashy game requires EXTREME CONTEXT AWARENESS.
</p>

<p>
	When you pull off a move like groping a girl's tits, you must be damn sure she is attracted to you, it is in a socially permissible place (like a nightclub), and you must do it in a non-creepy way.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of me doing that, I first ask her for verbal permission.
</p>

<p>
	"OMG! Your boobs are amazing! May I squeeze them?"
</p>

<p>
	She giggles and says, "Yes"
</p>

<p>
	Then you squeeze away.
</p>

<p>
	This is not nice guy behavior. This is boss behavior. If you can pull that off, you've got some serious skill. There is no way a creepy newbie can pull that off with a hot girl. That requires hundreds of hours of practice and attunement to her emotional state and the social context. You would never do such a thing at a cafe during the daytime.
</p>

<p>
	When you are very experienced with game, there's a lot of outrageous stuff you can get away with. But not as a creepy, awkward, inexperienced newbie. Situational awareness requires years of experience to dial in.
</p>

<p>
	Well-calibrated, non-creepy physical escalation is an art form.
</p>

Hence your reality is less solid and more spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	This is quite common.
</p>

<p>
	You basically have natural psychedelics in your head all the time. The anti-psychotics dampen that down, making you more grounded, like a normie.

<p>
	Pretty much. Why would you want bulging muscles? Only to feed your self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
	But exercise for health is not ego. But exercise for health will not give you bulging muscles. It will make you fit and lean.

		</p>

		<p>
			<em>-In a mushroom trip:</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			How to capture the change in music from what it was, to the immediate direct message, to you in particular, from God. (pre-transpersonal)<br />
			<br />
			When someone asks, "how you doin" and you get that endless pointless feeling like "chillin" is a melancholic lie.<br />
			<br />
			When life feels like a joke that you're the butt of.<br />
			<br />
			When your identity and survival seems like the ultimate mockery and death is the answer. (surrender?)
		</p>

		<p>
			Losing consciousness (or connection with the body/reality/visual/motor) or going to a grey identity-less static love-snow place, or having a "seizure"
		</p>

		<p>
			What to do when the experience becomes overwhelming, or the circumstances become less than ideal outside your control. (intruders, animals, accidents, realizing misuse mid-trip)
		</p>

		<p>
			How to emotionally or logically navigate urges like: "Are my parents okay? and should I call them right now?" ; "Am I physically dying?" ; "do I need EMS?" ; "Will anyone understand?" ; "Is this gutter-punk the devil?" ; "Why can't I find comfort without dying?" ; "Can I die without dying?" ; "Should I make myself vomit? Will it lessen this intense comeup?" and others.

I often get an urge, but then hold myself back. It can be very tempting to intellectually rip someone apart. But if you're conscious and introspect for a second, you'll recognize it as ego.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I've adopted a general policy of not debating anyone. I don't want to be lured into such egoic games. If you refuse to debate, you automatically win.

<p>
	Both are effectively ethnic cleansing, just at different scales.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that the psychology motivating the actions are fundamentally the same: fear and hatred of another ethnicity. Both are coming from toxic stage Blue.

	I wasn't talking about Yellow debates, I was talking about looking at debates from a Yellow stage yourself. If YOU don't bring the Yellow to the debate, you won't find it there.

	Debates are not a Yellow activity. Yellow people got better things to do than debate.

	It's not a strange loop, it's a SPIRAL! A spiral is a loop that keeps moving upward.

<p>
	Aubrey does all his trips with shamans in the rain forest. Of course he's gonna have that shamanic, tribal vibe. I see nothing special in that. Does that help him integrate stage Purple? I would bet. It's hard to learn Purple in the modern world, you really gotta go live in a remote tribe.

<p>
	I'd say the biggest value of debates is that they at least expose you to different worldviews, as opposed to just being in an echo-chamber. It can be revealing, for example, to see how a Nazi or a libertarian thinks. Seeing his thought process is valuable and useful as you learn epistemology. You can catch the epistemic mistakes and learn from them.
</p>

<p>
	Debates have to be watched from a stage Yellow, meta perspective. Most people fall into the trap of watching debates from a Tier 1 perspective of picking a side.
</p>

<p>
	If you're going to watch a debate, you should approach it like a scientist observes chimps in the wild. Don't become the chimp.

<p>
	There are no rules to this. You can't predict when it will happen.
</p>

<p>
	Most people will need 100+ awakenings I think because your psyche is just too impure to handle it. Each trip purifies your blockages a bit. And also, because you cannot integrate that much wisdom, insight, and understanding in just a few trips. You will probably need YEARS of integration work just to clear up your mind.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The practical answer is that if you have not done 100 breakthrough trips on various substances, you have no clue what consciousness really is.
</p>

<p>
	So very practically: set your goal to do 100 breakthrough trips at least. But pace it out slowly over years, with proper time to integrate everything. Go at a comfortable pace, but also, don't stop because you think you got it all. You have certainly not got it all.
</p>

<p>
	Do not fall into the Alan Watts trap of saying that "Once you get the message, hang up the phone." This is very bad advice. The psychedelic space is so deep, so rich, so complex -- that without 100 trips you're just like a baby taking your first steps. Don't try to rush this process. Make it a slow, patient life-long exploration and expansion process. You need to adopt a long-view rather than just hoping to get it over with. Enjoy it. Don't even think about reaching the end, just think about going deeper. Explore Yourself! And don't let anyone shame you for doing so. Explore Yourself so deeply that all your questions are answered. If you still have unanswered questions, you're not done. And if you have no unanswered questions, you're not asking enough questions.
</p>

<p>
	Stop worrying about being done. If it ever happens, it will happen on its own. Explore without any pressure on yourself to finish.
</p>

<p>
	JP does criticize extremism on the right. The problem is that he does not talk at all about the dangers of the normal right-wing. The problem is not merely the neo-Nazis and conspiracy theorists. The problem is that like 80% of the Republican party denies basic reality and facts and gaslights like crazy and have very regressive policies. And there is a rise of right-wing authoritarianism and nationalist movements all over the world. Yet JP is crying about SJWs.
</p>

<p>
	It's a mis-assessment of the real threats to democracy.
</p>

<p>
	SJWs did not threaten US democracy. The right-wing did. JP has to answer for how he got it so wrong. It's not the Post-Modernists who stormed the US Capitol, it's people who gravitate towards JP's stage Blue teachings and bitterness towards SJWs.
</p>

<p>
	JP exaggerates the threats of SJWs and ignores the very real threats of the right-wing: not the radicals, but even the more normal ones. For example, why does he appear on PragerU and FoxNews, both horrible and untruthful propaganda machines? This is not proper for a serious intellectual to do. He does not speak out against them nearly enough.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like PragerU, FoxNews, OAN, and NewsMax are arguably the most toxic and corrupting force in US politics. It's way worse than anything universities do. Yet you will not hear any of this listening to JP, you will hear about how bad SJWs are.

<p>
	If you actually bother to read Godel's dialogues and personal letters (which I did) you would learn that Godel was profoundly metaphysical and sharply criticized the non-metaphysical rationalists of his day as being mindless and clueless. Godel was a Platonist. Godel's thinking extended far beyond any strict logic proofs. But to a mindless rationalist only a strict logic proof of anything counts. They simply refuse to consider or think deeply about any implications by saying, "But it's not in the formal proof, so it's just woo-woo stuff".
</p>

<p>
	But the entire point of Godel's theorems was to prove that Truth cannot be captured by any proof!
</p>

<p>
	There are also more generalized proofs with Tarksi's Incomplete Theorem. But the rationalists have no interest in such things.
</p>

<p>
	They simply have no interest in connecting the dots, and as soon as they see someone connecting the dots they cry, "New Age mumbo jumbo!" and think they are being rational. This is exactly the kind of thinking Godel warned against.
</p>

	I can't explain everything in one video.

	DMT does not have the same effect on me as other people. It does not create colorful visuals for me and no entities.

<p>
	It is not a matter of loving Hitler in the way you might love your children. It's a metaphysical matter of realizing that Hitler is part of Universal Love.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, don't make a shadow of anything.

<p>
	All that self-doubt and fear is totally normal. You need to paint hopeful visions for your future to inspire yourself. Stop wallowing in negative thoughts and reorient your mind towards those aspects of reality which make you feel love and inspiration. And keep doing that ever day without quitting.

<p>
	The solution is to get serious about life. Realize your life is short, so get to the hard work of living it passionately. You need to realign your life to fit your values. So hatch a plan and then get to work on it. Even a half-baked plan is better than no plan at all.
</p>

<p>
	That feeling is important. Don't try to suppress it, rather listen what it is telling you: "Hey! Silly human! Your life is out of alignment with your values. Warning! Warning!"

	For me it is more powerful than 5-MeO. Too powerful. Unbearable, suicidal levels of consciousness. Imagine a beauty so infinite it makes you want to kill yourself because you cannot stand to look at it.

He's another example of a Yellow Game B thinker who is at times openly hostile towards the excesses of Green, and I can't sense whether it's because he has a Green shadow or if he's just being his blunt bombastic self. Either way, I really enjoy his conversations as he comes off as some normal dude sitting on the porch shooting the shit but from a stage Yellow perspective.

<p>
	I have not heard of him before.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with hostility towards Green is that Green is our next stage for the next 50 years collectively. Is it wise to be hostile towards the next step mankind must take?

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The dictionary definition of omniscience is essentially correct.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that your knowing is so profound that it cannot be put into words, nor logic, nor equations -- it is fully embodied at the material level. For example, you know your hands by HAVING hands, not by thinking about them. So it's closer to BEING than knowing some conceptual facts or scientific information.
</p>

<p>
	And the other trick to it is that the ego cannot control it -- as the materialist always desires to do. So you are omniscient but there is no ego who can manipulate this omniscience for personal gain. You won't be guessing any lottery numbers because the lottery and numbers themselves are obviously imaginary and silly.
</p>

<p>
	Furthermore, you are so conscious that things like "scientific facts" no longer exist. Nor will you necessarily be conscious of stuff like how many particles of sand exist on Earth, because at this level of consciousness you are aware that particles of sand and the Earth itself are just imaginings of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	You will be omniscient only of your bubble of consciousness -- because that's all there ever was. So this materialist idea of: "Well if you're omniscient why can't you read my mind?" won't work because you're too conscious for the existence of other minds.
</p>

<p>
	Omniscience is not very useful from the ego's POV. And there's a good reason for that. Once you become omniscient you will realize that reality has always been perfect and there is no need to change anything. The desire to "improve" reality via omniscience turns out to be nothing but materialist idiocy and ego fantasies. The design is already perfect. You just surrender to it. You do not start dicking around with it to suit yourself. And if you are so selfish as to desire to dick around with it, you will never access omniscience. The cost of admission is your desire to control or improve anything.
</p>

	The protocol is don't eat for 4 hours prior to trip and take a shit 10-60 minutes before you trip.

	I gamed search engine algorithms.
</p>

<p>
	But those methods are no longer valid because search engines close loopholes every year.
</p>

<p>
	These aren't the google days of 2008. Oh... what glorious and crazy days those were.
</p>

<p>
	Business requires constant adaptation as the marketplace shifts underneath your feet.
</p>

<p>
	I don't recommend gaming things as your business strategy. It never holds up well and it is the way of devilry.

<p>
	Green can also be like that.
</p>

<p>
	Bret has a much better grasp of Green than, say, JP. I would place Bret higher than just Orange. I think he's Green in many ways. Just in a more sober and rational way.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Jamie is way beyond that. He is a student of Ken Wilber.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Wrong.
</p>

<p>
	1) You do not need to have any illness to not be able to flush out heavy metals. It varies by genetics but even a fully health person can fail to filter them out well. Your natural flush rate varies from as low as 40% to as high as 90%. This assumes you're healthy. If you are unhealthy your rate could be lower.
</p>

<p>
	2) Even if you genetics are perfect, you will still never flush out all heavy metals you consume, and they will accumulate in your brain and organs, and never leave. The only question is at what rate they accumulate. The more of them you consume the faster the rate. And once they enter your brain and organs there is no way to get them out other than serious detox protocols and also by eliminating further consumption.
</p>

<p>
	Heavy metals are never listed in the ingredients.
</p>

<title>Wondering what mystical experiences are real.</title>

<p>
	You are getting too technical with your definition of experience. I am using it causually here, inclusive of Being.
</p>

<p>
	Experience = Being + ego.
</p>

<p>
	When ego is removed from the equation, experience is absolutized.
</p>

<p>
	Just different ways of saying it.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to absolutize your experience of life. Make your experience Absolute.

<p>
	Exactly. You have multiple personality disorder and you keep reinforcing it with your dualistic logic.
</p>

<p>
	Multiple personality disorder does not mean there are actually many personalities. It means you are hallucinating all the personalities and tricking yourself into buying the illusion.

<p>
	What you see is all there ever is. Period. End of story.
</p>

<p>
	Your consciousness is Absolute. Nothing can be hidden from view.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is that it's too radical for you to accept.
</p>

<p>
	All objections to this are just a distraction created by the ego to weasel it's way out of accepting the obvious.
</p>

<p>
	You can keep creating distractions, or you can bite the bullet and realize you are God.
</p>

<p>
	Skepticism is not your friend here. Be ware the trap of skepticism.

<p>
	I am not saying his tears are fake. Of course he feels love and passion. Hitler felt love and passion. We all do.
</p>

<p>
	But the love is biased and limited by his level of consciousness, fear, and egoic construction.
</p>

<p>
	I mean that if JP truly opened his heart he would stop all railing against SJWs. He would laugh at himself and how silly and lacking in empathy he was.
</p>

<p>
	It is literally just a lack of understanding, consciousness, and love caused by a dense ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue has love. But stage Green has more love.

<title>Wondering what mystical experiences are real.</title>

<p>
	Actually you got it backwards: 100% of all experiences are absolutely true.
</p>

<p>
	Since experience of any kind is Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you see Jesus, then you saw Jesus. Now, what you think that means is a whole nother matter. Jesus is imaginary, just like everything else.

<title>JBP on Psychedelics!</title>

<p>
	It is never enough to just do a psychedelic. What really matters is whether one is eager to deconstruct one's reality. And obviously JP is not eager to do that. So psychedelics will be threatening to such a mind.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are JP's kryptonite.

	He cries crocodile tears but will not vote for progress to fix corruption or climate change.

<p>

<p>
	Come back and tell me when JP actually votes for a politician who will fix predatory capitalism. Until then, it's all empty words and excuses.

	You guys seem to really not get this: your highest intelligence will not come from social interactions, it will come solo, all alone. Socializing with people tends to make you dumber, not wiser.

<p>
	I didn't make anything personal. There is a profound absence of proper analysis of Jordan Peterson's teachings on YT. People from the left and right are both being deceived about him and are not being properly guided towards the highest understanding they could have of reality. That's where I come in. My only function in life is to help people understand. That's all I do. And it doesn't matter the subject or person or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	I held back from doing a JP video for 3 years because I didn't want it to look like I was just talking about him for clicks.
</p>

<p>
	I was very concerned about the stage Green shadow that JP fans were implicitly absorbing by watching his talks.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This is such an absurd framing for 3 reasons:
</p>

<p>
	1) All spiritual work is gradual. You might as well argue, why would anyone ever want to go to a meditation retreat to only awaken part time?
</p>

<p>
	NOBODY awakens in one single shot. This is pure nonsense myths.
</p>

<p>
	2) Time is an illusion. So the idea that a psychedelic awakening is "impermanent" or "temporary" is purely a delusion of the ego-mind. A psychedelic awakening is Absolute, and the Absolute does not care how long it lasts in human time. A psychedelic awakening is timeless and Eternal, even if it only lasts "15 minutes" in human time. Stop conflating time with truth. 1 second is as true as 1 million years.
</p>

<p>
	3) To claim that psychedelic trips do not grow you is absurd and contradicts all the science on psychedelics.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If a person has a mental illness, they should not be following my work.
</p>

<p>
	The things I teach require serious groundedness. Read the disclaimers and warnings in the Forum Guidelines about mental illness.
</p>

<p>
	If you are mentally ill and decide to follow my work, that's on you. I give no promises about whether things will turn out good or bad for you because your mind is unstable and you may easily misconstrue the work.
</p>

<p>
	From the Forum Guidelines:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">

If you struggle with these basics, if you are suicidal, if you are on serious medications, if you are an addict, you should seek professional help with such issues.

<p>
	Especially protein powder. Protein powders can be straight up poison.
</p>

<p>
	All powders highly concentrate heavy metals and toxins.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine taking 50 gallons of milk and boiling it down to 1 lb of powder. That's a 50x increase in heavy metal concentration.

<p>
	I fully encourage you to listen to other spiritual teachers. I have no desire to monopolize your mind.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know who has equal amount of understanding and frankly I don't care. You should stop trying to equate people and just appreciate many diverse perspectives. You don't need some ultimate one perspective or teacher, what you need is many diverse sources which you will integrate into your own master understanding.

			The weird thing about autism is that you're not technically unable to<em> feel </em>empathy like a sociopath, you're just unable to understand why you should feel empathy in certain situations, because you can't read social cues very well. It also has to do with deficits in understanding theory of mind on a pure cognitive level. So feeling vs. understanding.

<title>How do you 'resolve' extreme dualities? How do you integrate polar opposites?</title>

<p>
	It is a foolish mistake to automatically assume the truth is the mid-point between any two given positions.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is required to adjudicate and resolve between such things with wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	A true decision requires you to cut off one possibility entirely from another. There is a deep power in saying NO to a thing. It is liberating.
</p>

<p>
	In your situation you should not look for the middle way, you should look for the right way. The right way is whichever aligns with your genuine passions and values.
</p>

<p>
	You lack clarity on your values -- that's what makes such decisions difficult. So clarify your values.
</p>

<p>
	You can also experiment with both forks of the road before making your final decision. You can live 1 year in a cave and you can spend 1 year chasing sex and money. And then see which one you like better.
</p>

<p>
	You also make a plan such as: I will work on business and sex for the next 5 years. Then I will retire to a cave for 2 years. Then I will return back to society and live as a householder and run a business.
</p>
