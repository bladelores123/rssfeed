<title>is really gender just a relative stuff?</title>

<p>
	To be clear, a rock does not have gender unless you project it there.
</p>

<p>
	In truth nothing has gender. Gender is an imaginary category, as all categories are.
</p>

<p>
	If you find gender in a rock, you put it there.
</p>

<p>
	If you find gender in a human, you put it there.
</p>

<p>
	You put everything everywhere. Otherwise it couldn't exist. Because you are God.
</p>

<p>
	But this takes some SERIOUS consciousness to grasp. Nothing short of awakening will do.
</p>

	I am too conscious to teach that stuff now.
</p>

<p>
	My time is limited and we got bigger fish to fry. If you want to learn PUA then there are many PUAs on Youtube you could learn from.
</p>

<p>
	If you're coming to me, you should want to learn about consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And none of this means that I never go out. Maybe you'll see me in the club some day <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	Maybe so, but that ain't fascism, that's corporatism -- a stage or two above.
</p>

<p>
	CNN does speak out against fascists like white supremacy movements. No CNN anchor would equivocate about that. They would call it beyond the pale. They would not spin to justify it, unlike Fox News. Fox News would find some way to defend it.

<p>
	So easy. Imagine an adult you hugging a sad suffering child you.
</p>

<p>
	And many other visualizations are possible. Like loving your entire life, body, and mind exactly as it is.

<p>
	Hangovers could be due to lack of nutrients for the brain. Fuel yourself up with antioxidants and other brain supplements after the trip. I've heard this can really help with MDMA hangovers, which means it should also work on all types of hangovers.

<p>
	This is when it's good to remember the relativity of reproduction. His biological offspring may be gone, but his impact on society won't be so easily erased.

	I am done replying to this thread.
</p>

<p>
	I have spoken the truth. Now it's on you to do the work to get it.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that these are extremely advanced teachings. Treat them with the respect and nuance they deserve. It will take the average person 10 to 20 years of serious inner work to fully fathom what was said in this thread. Sloppiness, laziness, and self-bias just won't cut it here.

	Mushrooms tend to be one of the few psychedelics which can produce a hangover for me. Long and deep mushroom trips can be exhausting, requiring another day of rest.

<p>
	Other psychedelics I no hangovers from.

<p>
	Two basic solutions to this problem:
</p>

<p>
	1) Practice Self-Love. Using visualization, give yourself the love that your wish your mother gave you. Give yourself unlimited love. Give yourself the love you which any woman or girlfriend would give you. Do this for 10 minutes every day for several months. It will make a big difference.
</p>

<p>
	2) Go attract some women and have sex with them. Get a girlfriend.
</p>

<p>
	After you do steps 1 & 2, your problem should be gone. If not, repeat steps 1 & 2.
</p>

<p>
	Politicians digging up dirt on opponents is par for the course.
</p>

<p>
	What's not okay though is if the dirt-digging discovers actual serious dirt.
</p>

<p>
	Like if your opponent discovers you murdered someone, well, that means you're disqualified from the job. It isn't really dirt if it's true that you murdered someone.
</p>

<p>
	The problems with Trump are not merely his sexual scandals and tabloid dirt. It's the fact that he's seriously corrupt as fuck.
</p>

<title>How to deal with collective ego backlash</title>

You will not be able to self-actualized effectively if you are enmeshed in a regressive family situation. If you're a teen, it's okay. You can still do lots of inner work without making it known to people. But aim to move out and spread your wings.
</p>

<p>
	Most families are pretty barbaric, regressive, and dysfunctional. So don't worry too much about it. As a teen your job is to manage the best you can given that situation until you're able to move out. You still have a 60 years of growth ahead of you. You are already ahead of the curve just by knowing about self-actualization and spirituality.
</p>

<title>Concentration/ADHD help</title>

<p>
	You need to research all the cures that have been found for ADHD.
</p>

<p>
	They are out there. Many of them. Do the research and get your health in order.
</p>

<p>
	If you have an underlying physical issue like heavy metal toxicity or some vitamin deficiency, no amount of meditation technique is going to overcome that. Meditation technique assumes you have a solid healthy body/brain/mind to work with.
</p>

<p>
	Don't just assume that ADHD is some genetic condition handed down to you by God. It's probably a consequence of improper lifestyle.
</p>

<title>Is ignoring people okay?</title>

<p>
	You need to learn to set boundaries and communicate your values and boundaries to people rather than acting silent or passive aggressive.
</p>

<p>
	Better communication is crucial.
</p>

<p>
	People-pleasing is a common problem. It's worth taking the time to work that out in yourself. You don't want to live as a people-pleaser your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	Once you solve your people-pleasing, then you will be able to effectively communicate and enforce your values and boundaries with people, and you won't have to ignore them or suffering silently.
</p>

<p>
	By that silly logic you can also say:
</p>

<p>
	"Why not murder a few people? There are 8 billion people on the planet. It will have effectively 0 impact."
</p>

<p>
	"Why not rape a few people? There are 8 billion people on the planet. It will have effectively 0 impact."

	"Why not burn down a few houses? There are billions houses on the planet. It will have effectively 0 impact."
</p>

<p>
	"Why not shit in the street? It's only one shit out of billions. It will have effectively 0 impact."
</p>

<p>
	Any one thing has effectively zero impact in the universe. And yet your actions still matter.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	In practice, many US elections end up being very close. Most US elections are with 1%-5%. So your vote is not really lost in a seas of millions of others. Every election cycle we have recounts somewhere because the vote difference is so small. Sometimes by a thousand or less votes.
</p>

<p>
	Trump only won by about 70,000 votes in a few key areas.
</p>

<p>
	And local elections are even closer. They usually have under 100,000 votes total. 1000 votes is enough to make the difference in a local election. So your vote counts a lot more than you think.

	There are 1000s of awakened people all over the planet.
</p>

<p>
	Most of them aren't celebrities so you won't hear about them.

<p>
	Don't limit your worldview to what is popular on YouTube.

<p>
	Some of the most awakened people are not in the public eye at all.

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/17084-ethanb121/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="17084" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/17084-ethanb121/" rel="">@ethanb121</a>  Sounds like you're in need of serious healing work.
</p>

<p>
	I would look for an energetic / psychic healer in your town who you can talk to. Try out several of them to find one you resonate with and go as often as you can. They usually cost: $70 - $150 / session.
</p>

<p>
	This is something you'll want another person to help you with. The worst thing for you is to be too isolated and not around high-consciousness people. You need someone who can help you shift your energy around and show you new perspectives on life.
</p>

<p>
	I would not rely too much on traditional medical professionals. They rarely understand the root issues of things. Clearly there is mental trauma that you're struggling with. Some drug is not going to magically fix it.
</p>

<p>
	I also recommend you get thorough bloodwork testing. Find out if there's anything missing. Also check for heavy metal toxicity via provoked urine testing. Heave metals in the brain can cause all sorts of problems like this. Get your health and nutrition in order. Do detox protocols. Liver detox, kidney detox, heavy metal detox, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And overall I just recommend you do A LOT of research into your condition. Search the web, buy books on this exact issue, read, take notes, find people who have successfully cured  themselves and copy what they did. Research is crucial. You need to understand this condition in and out. And not just what traditional medicine says. Look into all sorts of alternative medicine approaches.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry, not much advice I can offer besides this as I don't specialize in these kinds of issues.
</p>

<p>
	I would also add:
</p>

<p>
	1) Psychedelics might save your life
</p>

<p>
	2) Start practicing self-love immediately. You need to open your heart, live more from your heart not your head, and forgive yourself and fully accept and love yourself exactly as you are. See a psychic healer who can show you how to get out of your head and reside in your heart. The heart doesn't contain all those thoughts. Find some guided meditations which shift you into your heart and use those religiously.
</p>

<p>
	3) Neurofeedback brain training could also be very effective for such a condition. You can search for neurofeedback centers and specialists in your town. Every major town has them. A dozen of those sessions could cure you or at least reduce your suffering.
</p>

<p>
	4) Hypnosis might also be very effective. Look for hypnotherapists in your town.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Also, your message needs to FIT your audience. This is key. You can apply Spiral Dynamics here. If you're speaking to a stage Orange audience, a New Age vision of meeting God will only annoy them. However, a vision of success, personal improvement, science, technology, money, sex, business, big muscles, fast cars, big houses, luxury shopping -- that will excite them. Conversely, if you're talking to a group of hippies, a vision of fast cars and luxury shopping will fall flat on its face.

	The most important function of cooking is to kill parasites.

<p>
	Undeveloped tribes have massive parasite problems.
</p>

<p>
	People in the developed world do not appreciate how bad parasites can get because we've virtually wiped them out with cooked and processed foods.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, interpretations vary. Interpretations are not the Absolute itself. But also they are.
</p>

<p>
	The paradoxes here are unavoidable because the Absolute cannot be captured in any finite symbolic order, since the Absolute is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	When you are directly conscious of the Absolute, you become it. You are not interpreting it, thinking about it, or even looking at it. You and it become ONE. Then you can come back down into duality and do interpretations and analysis on it. But when you're doing that, you're again disconnected from it. Yet at the same time you cannot ever be disconnected from it because it is all things at all times.

</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is singular and the same for everyone.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as falsehood or untruth. Just different degrees of confusion about the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is so total that is includes within it all "falsehoods" because it is them.
</p>

<p>
	If anything I said in this thread confuses you or leaves you skeptical, you need to study nondual literature (see my book list for ideas). You're lacking a basic conceptual understanding of nonduality.

<p>
	God/Absolute is a tautology. There is no alternative to the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	How your mind interprets the Absolute can vary, but the Absolute itself, Truth itself, Oneness, is the same for everyone. Hence it's called Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute means it doesn't change under any circumstances.

<p>
	After that you ARE Love. You are already dead and there is nothing left to do but play. You are no longer in control. God is doing God. The material world continues to appear but it is like you were never born. Human life is over at this point, even though human things still happen and a human body continues to survive in the human world. But all of it is not human to you any more. You are in the eternal mind of God. Forever here in every moment. Infinity. The one and only Creator. Alone by yourself forever. Perfection, heaven, paradise. The one thing which cannot ever be spoken to anyone.

<p>
	I recognize that bhakti is one path out of many for some people. I recognize the relativity of all paths to awakening. The question is, do you?
</p>

<p>
	Personally it's a path I don't resonate with. Or, you could say I am doing bhakti yoga, but my deity is reality itself, not any one classic avatar. My devotion is to Truth and Consciousness in their pure, abstract, formless form.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to pray to elephant-man, knock yourself out.
</p>

<p>
	My only question for you at the end of all that will be: are you conscious that your elephant-man is imaginary and that you are God? If not, your path hasn't taken you all the way.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is this: if you spend years praying to elephant-man, when I tell you that your elephant-man is imaginary, you are very likely to get upset and angry and defensive because if it was imaginary, why did you spend all those years praying to it? And that's exactly my point.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than dicking around with elephant-man, why not cut straight to the chase: You are God imagining all of reality. There is no higher truth than this. Devote yourself to realizing that. And that will be the highest bhakti.
</p>

<title>My very first psychedelic trip: 1.5g Shrooms.....wow...thank you so much</title>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10453-moon777light/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="10453" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10453-moon777light/" rel="">@moon777light</a> Good. That was a nice newbie intro. Your mind is still very chaotic and random, which is why you had all those wacky visions.
</p>

<p>
	As you do more, you must learn to focus your mind and contemplate the nature of reality rather than just going on joyride visions.
</p>

<p>
	Visions are fun, scary, and interesting, but what really matters is getting down to understanding what consciousness is, and what YOU are.
</p>

<p>
	So far you got a tiny taste of what consciousness can do: it is infinite imagination -- which is why you're able to have all those wacky visions. But you don't yet comprehend what consciousness in itself is and why it is here, or all of its many facets. You also probably don't understand how conscious in the trip connects with consciousness in "material reality". You have to build an intellectual bridge between your trips and "real life" until you realize that your "real life" is just another trip.
</p>

<p>
	Keep your future doses low. You have much more to learn at these lower doses. Mushrooms can be extremely challenging at the 4g range and above. At 4g+ your old life and reality will start to completely disappear and you will enter the phantasms of your mind. Since your mind is chaotic and impure and lacks nondual understanding, you will encounter all sorts of horrors of your own imagination and you will start to go insane. 2 grams is a good solid dose to do lots of work with without totally freaking yourself out.
</p>

<p>
	Try contemplating questions next time like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is consciousness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is time?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is "other"?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is self? What am I?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is awakening?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is love?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is evil?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is the brain?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is death?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is nonduality?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is awakening?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Oneness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is intelligence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Will?
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The next time you trip, realize that whatever your mind imagines gets materialized. If you start to think of elephants you will see elephants on the carpet. Wonder why does this happen? It happens because you are God imagining the world and the psychedelic removes the shackles on Infinite Mind.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, turn your gaze directly inwards and ask, "What am I?!"
</p>

<p>
	Be prepared for epic strange loops, paradox, and mindfuckery.
</p>

<title>Closing in Game</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44638-closing-in-game/?do=findComment&amp;comment=562521</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Closing is a very specific skill set.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to just date randomly and see what happens, go ahead. But you'll lose lots of girls. If you're okay with that, fine. But most guys would get very frustrated and want to construct an optimized skill set to deal with the repeated challenges.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4457-elisabeth/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="4457" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4457-elisabeth/" rel="">@Elisabeth</a> I understand your disgust, but you also have to see the relativity of the situation. Dating for men and for women is very different. This advice doesn't make sense from a woman's perspective but it does from the man's. You have to appreciate how much rejection the man has to deal with. It's not like the man can only approach one girl and make it happen. He has to approach hundreds. That process by its very nature is mechanical and objectifying, not just of the woman but also for the man. Imagine approaching 100 people and getting rejected 95 times. What do you do? Imagine that out of 100 approaches you get 5 people to like you and agree to come home with you because it's the world's perfect match. A match made in heaven. But then 4 in 5 times the person's friends will come and drag them away and you will never speak to them again. What do you do when facing such odds?
</p>

<p>
	See, from the woman's POV none of this is noticed as a problem because you play the selector role and you don't have to do 100s of approaches. From your POV, one right approach is all it takes because you are on the receiving end of the approach. So from your selfish POV you think a guy should invest tons of energy into one approach. But from the guy's POV it's exactly the opposite. He can't invest any energy into any one approach because most of them fail.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the relativity in self-agenda here. If you say, "But what about true love?" Yeah, that's your female self-agenda. "True love" is defined differently for a female vs a male given their reproductive asymmetries.
</p>

<p>
	Neither side is right. It's relative. It's survival. It's selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	My advice was for men, not for women. Of course women are not going to like it because if dating advice is any good it, by definition, encroaches on the other gender's self-agenda. The man's agenda is to invest less energy into the woman, the woman's agenda is to have the man invest all his energy into her alone. At least initially until a serious relationship is formed. Then things can equalize somewhat.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I feel terrible when I eat heavy carbs. That's like the worst possible meal for me, even if it is all organic, whole, and vegan. A big load of carbs hitting my gut kills my consciousness for about 2 hours.
</p>

<p>
	If eat some smoked salmon or a burger on lettuce, my consciousness and energy is smooth and consistent.
</p>

<p>
	It's so noticeable I stay away from carbs like that.
</p>

<p>
	Green veggies and fruits don't create this problem for me, but they also have so little calories that I have to be eating them every 2 hours to stay energized and not hungry -- which is highly inconvenient and impractical.
</p>

The mind wants to make shit up in order to feel certain and secure, even if the thing is totally false.
</p>

<p>
	People who predict exact dates for when the world will end get even more convinced the world will end after their dates pass and nothing happens. The ego-mind loves to double-down on its ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	If the world didn't end in 2012, surely it will end in 2013. Surely in 2014. Okay, now it definitely has to end in 2015. Okay, no later than 2016 for sure this time.

</p>

<p>
	Still, of course, that doesn't mean anything goes. Some stuff you simply may not be able to heal under your limited human powers. But you'd also be amazed at how much stuff can be healed. So it's worth a try.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you can't heal a thing, you might still be able to reduce the symptoms and suffering. You can find coping strategies too.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a serious health disorder, doing lots of research and experimentation is crucial.

<title>Do you need the help of a master/guru to face ultimate death?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	This is just basic logic:
</p>

<p>
	If awakening always required a guru or teacher, nobody would be awake, since there would never be that first person to wake up (for lack of a teacher).
</p>

<p>
	Clearly at least 1 person woke up without a guru/teacher. And if one can do it, more than one can do it.
</p>

<p>
	And of course, in practice, many people have woken up independently without teachers all over the world at different times in history.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, you may benefit greatly from good a guru/teacher. Awakening independently requires hardcore motivation and commitment which very few people have.
</p>

Focus first on the ordinary stuff before you start grappling with the tricky spiritual metaphysical stuff.
</p>

<p>
	As far as your real-world experience goes, you believe you are a human who has emotions and thoughts, and you believe that humans are responsible for their actions. This is what's true for you. Yes or no?
</p>

<p>
	So be honest about where you're at.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what some guru says, what matters is what's true in your experience. Some guru could tell you that you are God, but that is not your experience so don't approach life using the guru's story. Approach life as it is for you.
</p>

<p>
	If some day you realize you are not a human, then things will change for you. But that's not something you should worry about now.
</p>

<p>
	Also, spirituality tells you that you are EVERYTHING, so of course you ARE your thoughts and emotions too. You're just not only those things. Spirituality requires taking responsibility for how you create your whole reality. So there's no contradiction. But start with the easy stuff like the sentence completions.
</p>

<title>System Collapse!!</title>

<p>
	A collapse of what system?
</p>

<p>
	Democracy? Capitalism? Earth?
</p>

<p>
	I don't see these collapsing. There will be downturns for sure, but overall I think we aren't doing too bad. 100 more years of development will correct many of the current imbalances.
</p>

<p>
	The tide on environmental responsibility is turning. Capitalism has already clearly hit its limit and more people are open to the next stage of economics which will be a capitalist/socialist hybrid. Democracy is a bit under threat by nationalism right now, but that will not stick. Democracy should only get more democratic in the long term.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest wrench in the werks would be a nuclear detonation I think. The rest we can manage.
</p>

	It's an interesting typology model.
</p>

<p>
	Has a ring of truth to it.
</p>

<p>
	Just be careful not to limit yourself by it.

<p>
	The question is more complicated than simply "What is optimal?" There is also the question of what is practical.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps it is optimal for health to grow your own fields of celery and spend 2 hours juicing it every morning. But that's not practical for most people.
</p>

<p>
	There are trade-offs between optimal, practical, affordable, and pleasurable/enjoyable. And all of those are factors people care about.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are certainly not like a horse who is being fed meat or a lion who is being fed bananas. We are much more flexible. Flexibility is one of our stop strengths.

<p>
	History will be very unkind to Trump. Future generations will read about Trump in disbelief, wondering how 40% of the country could be so stupid as to buy anything he says. Those who supported Trump will be seen as neanderthals -- the way we think about Southern slaverowners today.
</p>

<p>
	Pretty soon after Trump's gone no one who supported him will admit they ever did. They will deny the whole thing because it will be too embarrassing to ever mention you supported him. Similar to how people today deny supporting the Iraq war. Similar to how no one today will admit that they or even their parents supported segregation. It's just too ugly to admit. Only those "others" could support something like segregation or slavery.

Of course there are some risks with psychdelics, especially when you are using them on mentally unstable people, but medication are more risky and in general there are risks with almost anything in life.

<p>
	Of course. Within the next 30 years psychedelics will be legalized for medical use for PTSD, depression, anxiety, OCD, ADHD, cancer, end of life care, marriage counseling, psychotherapy, other mental illnesses, and more.
</p>

<p>
	Clinical trials are already underway for MDMA, LSD, mushrooms, and more. All they need is some time and more funding.

<p>
	I have not researched that disorder.
</p>

<p>
	In general I'm suspicious of "genetic" as a justification for anything. Sure, a few very serious things might be genetic, but for the most part you should assume you got good genetics and look for other problems -- ways your genetics are being improperly expressed or used. Many problems that people tell themselves are "genetic" really are not, and are changeable with research and effort. You won't know until you try.

<p>
	Actually death has sorta the opposite effect. It removes all sense of urgency because after death you realize you are Eternal. You cannot really die and there is nowhere else to go. You as God will be here forever.
</p>

<p>
	But it has also motivated me to work harder towards fully embodying God, since nothing else matters. The sooner I can become God-like the more people I can share my love with and at deeper levels. So the the Leo organism is more motivated to better align itself with God rather than wasting time in devilish pursuits.

	Yes, except you will be Nothing then. So you will not be able to impose any of your selfish agenda on creation. Your Will will become identical to all of Creation itself in alignment with maximum Love.

	In a sense God doesn't a choice but to Will maximization of Love, because God is identical to Love. Will = Love at this highest level.

If you arr fully God, you are so selfless and loving and intelligent that you cannot make reality anything less than what it is.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	No! Because Leo is God in finite (limited) form. So here I am, in limited form, unable to make a table disappear.

			Would you say that evil and sinning exists from a relative perspective? Perhaps we sin to realize the pain and anguish only to stop sinning to maximize a higher form of love?

<p>
	Yes, relative.
</p>

<p>
	We sin because we are not sufficiently selfless. We are not sufficiently selfless because we have finite material forms which we must defend and survive. We must survive so that we can live long enough to feel seperate from God. We feel seperate from God so that we may reunite with God and realize we are God.
</p>

<p>
	That is the universal cycle of God-realization.

I mean what, do you srsly believe you will be able to make a table dissapear one day for example just because of your sheer will? I think you've been watching way too much nithyananda and sai baba.. hint hint.. both have been exposed as NOT being able to levitate AND not able to "materialize" objects into existence.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's exactly right, a table can be materialized out of thin air. Which is exactly how a table can exist at all and how God creates it.
</p>

<p>
	But this does not mean that the finite Leo organism has the ability to do this. It doesn't precisely because it is finite, because it is human.
</p>

<p>
	If you want infinite willpower you must become so selfless that you will cease having a physical body.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't a cop-out or an excuse, this is absolutely necessary and fundamental, otherwise Creation would be run by a devil and would not be maximum Love. A finite self cannot have infinite Will -- that requires total selflessness.

<p>
	The relative dream world of the ego and its survival is infected with lots of fear, of course.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is what keeps you from fully reuniting with the Godhead.
</p>

<p>
	I don't think we reincarnate to punish ourselves. God reincarnates to explore itself and be itself. There is no punishment, only various levels of consciousness and love.

<p>
	Depends on what you mean by "creationism".
</p>

<p>
	If you mean it in the silly Christian sense where the Earth is 5000 years old and humans lived alongside dinosaurs, and evolution never happened, then that's false.
</p>

<p>
	But if you mean it in the sense that an Infinite Intelligence designed the whole universe in its own Mind, that is true.

<p>
	I still think Trump has deep Russian connections. I just don't know if he deliberately conspired in the 2016 election.
</p>

<p>
	The important part is that he is compromised, not the 2016 election itself. His ties to Russia are largely financial and no one has seriously investigated his finances yet. Muller didn't look into that.
</p>

<p>
	Although we already know that he was working on a deal to build Trump Tower Moscow DURING the 2016 election!

<p>
	That's precisely the problem. Your vision is so limited that you do not even comprehend the simple fact that without pain in your body you'd be dead by the age of 3.
</p>

<p>
	All of the suffering of your body is there to make sure you survive long enough to do spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way, if you were designing a child from scratch, would you give your child the ability to feel pain? If you say "Obviously no!", you're a fool because that means your child will only be able to survive a year or two at most.
</p>

<p>
	You must contemplate the genius of God's design. Nothing is there willy-nilly. Nothing is there to torture you for the sake of torturing you. If you think something is not necessary, think again. If it exists, it is necessary in the bigger picture. Just keep in mind that the picture is really, really, really big. God's design must account for all creatures, not just your personal pleasure.

	Goals can be great at the beginning though, if you need to lose some weight or just getting into the hobby. Of course you can have goals to build up certain muscle groups or whatever. But you can't keep raising your goals forever. Nor is that even desirable.
</p>

<p>
	After 10-15 years of non-stop gym work, I gave up on the whole notion of fitness goals. It's a waste of energy which you should be channeling into your spiritual work. Moderate exercise is all that anyone needs once they are at a healthy weight and eating properly.
</p>

<p>
	You might even want to replace gym with hatha yoga at some point.

<p>
	I think it's good stuff if you can afford it. It might really help with certain issues. Not all issues, but some.
</p>

<p>
	You can find great local reiki healers simply via Yelp. And there are other kinds of healers besides reiki on there which might be even more useful, again, depends on the issue.
</p>

<p>
	It's definitely genuine. Whether it's worth the cost depends on what your goals are and your salary.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a decent salary it's a good investment.

<p>
	You're thinking about this is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Your fibromyalgia is likely the result of you living your life in unspiritual ways.
</p>

<p>
	The fibromyalgia isn't holding you back from spirituality, it is PUSHING you to wake up!
</p>

<p>
	Your body is screaming at you: WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WE CAN'T KEEP LIVING LIKE THIS! CONNECT ME TO SOURCE!!!!
</p>

<p>
	This is a much more robust issue than merely meditation. Your entire life needs to be spiritualized and infused with mindfulness and consciousness and love.

<p>
	No, we will not take that for granted.
</p>

<p>
	You don't take for granted that healing is an option. Healing happens on many levels: physical, mental, spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you find a local psychic healer / reiki healer who can help you work on your fibromyalgia and give you guidance.
</p>

<p>
	Fibromyalgia especially is a spiritually-related illness. If you had a broken spine, that might be another matter.

<p>
	Yes, you can do that. Battling the ego can sometimes be a useful formuation, but often not. Often the better approach might be to love the ego to death, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that every formulation will be dualistic. Every teaching will be dualistic, even nondual teachings. True nonduality cannot be spoken.

<p>
	Christianity is very dualistic in misleading ways.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the notion of being "a sinner" creates a battle between ego and God.
</p>

<p>
	"A sinner" is just a devil, ego, or self. But the sinner is an illusion. There is no sinner and no sin. Most Christians do not understand this. Christians gets trapped in the duality of good vs evil, which itself becomes the source of the illusion of evil. The mind creates evil by imagining it.
</p>

<p>

	It feels like Infinite Love. Imagine if you loved every object in the universe as much as you love your mother, your children, or your dog. But more! Literally Infinite Love! It is completely unlimited. You Love so much that it grows bigger and bigger and bigger until you realize that it literally has no end whatsoever. By this point your entire self gets annihilated in this love and you literally die as a human self. You die and become God -- which is pure Infinite Love.

</p>

<p>
	Death = Infinite Love
</p>

<p>
	Did you really think God would let you die into some hell? Don't confuse God for a devil. God has ensured that all beings die into Infinite Love. How did God guarantee this? By making Love and Death identical!

</p>

<p>
	Which is why all these egos (seem to) exist. God allows them because no one is forcing you not be a devil. God doesn't fight devils with force.

</p>

<p>
	God's Love is so great that God isn't bothered by Hitler. Your love is so small that you hate Hitler. That's because you're a devil. If you realized you were God, you'd love Hitler as much as you love your mother. But this is far to radical for mankind to admit. That's because mankind are devils. But luckily God is perfectly okay with that!

<title>Does spiritual awakening lead to a desire of starting your own business/pathway?</title>

<p>
	No, it all depends.
</p>

<p>
	Although in practice many awakened folks tend to run their own shops. Once you're that conscious it just doesn't makes sense to waste your consciousness working for some fool to earn him money.
</p>

<p>
	The point of awakening is that then you're in a great and rare position to help uplift the world. The world needs your conscious leadership. You don't awaken and then go work at Wall Street to make a killing, hehehe...

<p>
	Of course we do, because you are an ego. So your definition is deliberately backwards, to protect yourself. That how you survive.

<p>
	You could say it doesn't exist. It merely appears to.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes. Since there is only ONE thing, and it is LOVE, everything must be it, including any appearances or illusions, and everything is done for the sake of maximizing Love.
</p>

<p>
	Which closes the loop of the final duality: Why is there selfishness? To maximize selflessness!
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness and selflessness are identical! Ta-da! Which means: the devil is God! Which means: evil is Good! Which means: there is no evil, only Love!
</p>

<p>
	So in this way God defeats the devil. Not by fighting with the devil, but by leaving no room for a devil to exist. There never was a devil (ego). The devil/evil was always an illusion. There was only ever LOVE.
</p>

<p>
	And all illusions are there to maximize Love, they are the expressions of Love. Without illusion and survival, there could not be Creation. So of course all of your suffering is out of Love.
</p>

Doesn't God create everything selflessly? Isn't ego the veil that allows God to love itself?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	God/Oneness/Consciousness/Nothingness/Infinity is Love
</p>

<p>
	God is creation itself. God is selflessness itself. God is Love.
</p>

<p>
	No, ego is the prism which polarizes God's Infinite Absolute Love into limited, finite, material love.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Love is like pure white light. Once that Love materializes into some formed thing, or through some finite creature, that Love is made finite and selfish. It is exactly like shining pure white light through a prism which polarizes it into many lesser discrete colors. The love shining through all humans is like the color blue or red or yellow. But God's Absolute Love is white, containing all the above, being the Source.
</p>

<p>
	So when God's Love shines through a dirty prism like Hitler or Trump -- that's what love looks like in its finite form.
</p>

<p>
	When God's Love shines through a pure lens, it looks like that of Jesus or Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is the lens/prism. When you realize that ego isn't real, its like removing all prisms from the path of the light, allowing it to shine white.
</p>

<p>
	The clearest telescope is one which has no lens at all. The clearest lens is Nothingness! When your lens is Nothingness, you are Truth, you are Love, you are God. You stop looking at things, you BECOME the things you used to look at.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, God's Creation is completely selfless. Since all selves are imaginary.
</p>

			God does not have to realize its own godhood. It is already one. It is the ego that needs to learn its proper place and mature. It needs to learn to affirm the existence of others through love.

		<p>
			Missing how these two paths (death vs life) coincide is tragic.

<p>
	The ego doesn't exist. The ego cannot awaken. The ego cannot learn anything. It is the realization that ego never was -- that it is a total illusion -- which allows God to realize that it was God the whole time.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is the mistaken idea that reality is divided into parts: me, you, her, him, them, animals, Jesus, aliens, God, etc. To realize ONENESS is to end all these divisions and exist as ONE. That ONE is the real God.
</p>

<p>
	If the ego could awaken, that would mean there are two things: ego & something else which it awakens to. That would be duality. But Truth is ONENESS. So there cannot be an ego.
</p>

<p>
	We speak of ego as though it's a thing, but really where's speaking of a non-thing. It's like speaking about a snake which is actually just a rope that we thought was a snake. There never were two things: a snake and a rope. Nor did the snake become the rope. There never was a snake at all! Only rope! The snake was just a confusion. Which leaves us with oneness, ropeness.

<title>Bobby's perspective vs actualized.org</title>

<p>
	Watching that video, Bobby fundamentally misunderstands the notion of ONENESS and relativity.
</p>

<p>
	If God is ONE, if God is Infinite, you must be it. The distinction between self/other is relative. So there cannot be a difference between you and God, you and Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	To otherize God or Jesus is a monumental misunderstanding of spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	It is not the ego which wishes to become God. It's is GOD which wishes to awaken to GOD! To label the desire for God-realization as ego is basically the worst form of devilry (ignorance/selfishness) which forever keeps one separated from God.
</p>

<p>
	It has nothing to do with building a bigger Youtube channel, LOL.
</p>

<p>
	YOU ARE GOD! Wake up! Stop denying. It is actually the ego which pretends it is not God under a veil of false humility so that it can maintain a subtle sense of "other" and therefore maintain a sense of self. The ego makes God something other than itself so the ego could survival as a new spiritual ego, a Christian ego which is now a follower of Jesus. This is one of the ego's greatest self-deceptions and Bobby has fallen into it.
</p>

<p>
	ONENESS is the ultimate truth. Any sense of distinction or duality must collapse. Never forget this fundamental law.
</p>

<p>
	Bobby is God pretending to be a Christian who is not God. Bobby is God imagining Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	Bobby may have taken some psychedelics, but he did not properly contemplate and realize what they had to show him. Instead he fell back into selfishness. The humble Christian self is the ego in sheep's clothing.
</p>

<p>
	Like I keep saying, there are many, many degrees of comprehension and realization of what God is. Bobby is just scratching the surface of this whole thing. There is mindfuck after mindfuck yet for him to realize. Most important for him would be the realization that self and other are indistinguishable. "Leo" is just a figment of his (God's) imagination.
</p>

<p>
	It is not merely that the Holy Spirit flows through you -- NO! -- YOU ARE FUCKING GOD! The one and only! You are just trapped inside your own mind so deeply that you can't even imagine a way out.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you are visited by Jesus if you pray to him is because you are God imagining him! Your will creates this dream we call reality.
</p>

<p>
	Bobby's video is actually very useful because it illustrates how deep the self-deception can go. Even someone like him, who has studied Buddhism, psychedelics, Eastern mysticism, and even watched my videos -- can still fail to reach the deepest level of Truth by getting stuck at some lesser level. Which is why I constantly warn you guys about being so careful about your epistemology and the many degrees of realization. Spirituality is way more complex and tricky than you can imagine. Just when you think you've finally figured it out, you're self-deceived.
</p>

<p>
	I wish Bobby a quick recovery from his paradigm lock. So he can take back his full authority as the sole Creator of this Universe.
</p>

<p>
	This video is also a great example and reminder of how dangerous Christianity can be. It's an elaborate device of the devil to keep you from finding God. The devil achieves this precisely by co-opting the very thing you trust the most. Anything you blindly trust, the devil will use against you to hide God from you. You have to appreciate that the devil is pure, ingenious self-deception. The devil has turned self-deception into an artform the two crowning achievements of which are science and religion.

<p>
	Of course if there is a values mismatch that should kill it long-term. Sex can't resolve that problem.
</p>

<p>
	But if that's the case, cut it off rather than this kissing for 2 years until she gets a new boyfriend. That's just silly.
</p>

<p>
	With relationships, by dragging it out the suffering is made much worse.

<p>
	You're thinking about it in too limited a manner. It doesn't have to be immediate and direct.
</p>

<p>
	If you shit in a public pool, the shit will eventually come back to you because you'll be swimming around in it for a long time. That doesn't mean it will come back within 5 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Right now your logic is: "Well... the pool is quite large, so if I shit in the northwest corner but I swim in the southeast corner, chances of it coming back to me are low so maybe I can get away with it."
</p>

<p>
	Maybe. Depends a lot on what the condition is and how the psychedelics are used.

<p>
	Working with emotions is very tricky stuff because they are not logical and they completely control one's behavior and thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	Bulling your way through emotional issues with a cold heart and lots of discipline will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional issues require a compassionate, gentle, loving, mindful approach.
</p>

<p>
	It's about becoming heart-centered rather than stuck in your head. It's about feeling into things, feeling into your body.
</p>

<p>
	The whole macho attitude of dominating emotional problems has to go.
</p>

<p>
	He is great to listen to, but just keep in mind that he doesn't understand spirituality,  nonduality, awakening, love, etc.
</p>

<p>
	He makes some excellent points about politics and ideology that are worth integrating.
</p>

<p>
	He's not really a communist in the way most people use that term. He likes to be provocative. By "communist" all he really means is a larger role for the state, and moving towards world government.
</p>

<p>
	You can agree or disagree with him on that, but his points about how ideology works are quite profound and important to understand. He makes important structural points there.

<p>
	Look, even psychoanalysis can be useful. It all depends on how you use it and what level you want to reach.
</p>

<p>
	I am speaking from the point of reaching absolute understanding of Self and reality. It won't take you there.
</p>

<p>
	Shadow work is useful but it ain't awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Have to be clear about your goals to select the right methods. Sometimes you need shadow work. Sometimes you need nonduality.

<p>
	You can find God through Jesus, but it will be a very limited path and you will probably not understand that Jesus is imaginary and that you are God imagining him.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of understanding what God is. The deepest levels are nondual and formless, so any kind of imagery like Jesus will get in the way. It's also crucial to understand that all spiritual imagery is relative. You could worship an elephant-man and it would work the same as Jesus. Because it's all imaginary. To get stuck on one set of imagery is so limiting.

<p>
	Not a belief, a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you were in a different state of consciousness you could become a kangaroo. But you aren't there. Changing states of consciousness is a real challenge because it defines "physical reality". It has to appear rock solid for reality to feel solid and not dreamlike.
