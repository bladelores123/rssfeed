<title>Any tips on how to deal with an Obnoxious Family?</title>

There are many solutions available.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, mastering financial independence is challenging. But it's also highly worthwhile and an exciting opportunity for growth.
</p>

<p>
	I was in your shoes 10 years ago. I got fired from my first job in 1 day. Then a month later I found a much better job. And a year later I quit even that job and started my own biz and worked for myself for 10 years. Those first 5 years of doing biz were really exciting and scary times. Without that, Actualized.org would never have been possible.
</p>

<p>
	So keep the hope and really work the problem.
</p>

<p>
	Get a job and move out. Until then, you're in a coping holding pattern.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to break free of your family and forge your own life. Then you can set all the rules and values.
</p>

<p>
	In your early 20's the #1 priority should be to master making a living for yourself so you are not anyone's slave, including not your boss's slave.
</p>

<title>Why morality isn't a mere concept</title>

<p>
	Here's a simple thought experiment for you moralists:
</p>

<p>
	If we program a robot with a rule which says: "Do not kill robots" does that make this rule have any objective validity? If we program the robot to feel guilty for killing a robot, does that make it any more objective?
</p>

<p>
	What if we program another robot with the opposite rule? Which one of them is right? Based on who's criteria?
</p>

<p>
	Hey, ya'll, I need your help!
</p>

<p>
	I want to create a comprehensive list of video examples of prototypical stage Turquoise thinking.
</p>

<p>
	This is meant to be an educational tool for people learning about Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	So towards that end, scour Youtube and find all the videos you can which exhibit stage Turquoise thinking. Try to find videos which are short and sweet. The more diversity we can display here, the better. Try to find examples from various cultures.
</p>

<p>
	We will create a mega-thread like this for every stage in the Spiral, from Red to Turquoise. But here, let's just focus on Turquoise. Each week I will start a new mega-thread topic for the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	Do not start a political debate in this thread! It is not our goal here to defend our personal political positions or to judge any stage, but simply to compile examples.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for your help! I'm excited to see what kind of juicy stuff you dig up. Try to be selective with your choices.
</p>

<p>
	This can turn into a really cool list.
</p>

			The colloquial meaning of "True" is something like "in accordance with my experience of reality". This is obviously a grossly facile concetualization.
		</p>

		<p>
			What "Truth" means, in a strict sense, has been a central point of contention among philosophers for millenia, for good reason. "Truth" seems  to to be one of those truely acaleptic concepts, without any plausible consensus-conceptualization. 
		</p>

		<p>
			A few uncontroversial (and insipid) statements about truth:
		</p>

		<p>
			Some pedantic teutologies like "Every apple is an apple" and "1 = 1" seems incontestably true.
		</p>

		<p>
			A cartesian contention of the type "subjective experiences exists" seems incontestably true.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then there's socially constructed, definitional truths of the type "two" is defined as "the sum of one pluss one" => It is true that "1 + 1 = 2" within the context of this edifice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Organons like the laws of logic are mostly assumed to be true, but are occationally challenged.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any deeper/more interesting claims about truth thruth tends to be fraught with speculative assumptions, contrived definitions poorly maping onto the concept of "Truth" or just plain old sophistry.

<p>
	Be careful with all of these Western philosophical notions of truth. They are not Truth with capital T.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to see Truth with a capital T, just silently look around the room you're in right now. You're looking at Truth. But you're not fully conscious of just what it is yet because ego it taking this room as "my experience", which is a subtle conceptualization still.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is exactly what's right in front of you. Train your awareness right on it and hold it there for a long time without moving. Just silently observe the Truth. Connect with the mystery of existence.
</p>

<p>
	Your body is made of Truth, the floor is made of Truth, the coffee table is made of Truth, etc. The question is, what the hell is it? It ain't molecules or atoms. It ain't even experience. What is it?
</p>

<p>
	In this work you are not after a "picture of reality" you are after pure reality itself, which means all picture must be discarded.
</p>

<p>
	If you want pictures of reality, go study science. Inquiry is not about pictures. It's about BEING reality.
</p>

<p>
	This notion you have of "reality" has to go. It's just a concept. Deconstruct it. What is this thing you call "reality"? Notice it's just an idea. What you see in your direct experience is prior to your notions of "reality".
</p>

<p>
	Strip all knowing from the present moment until you are just left sitting in your room with no idea what anything is. Even remove the idea that you are alive, sitting in a room. Or that were ever born. Strip it all off! Try to get to pure raw sensation without any ideas or images of what it is. Don't worry about missing out on reality. Everything that is true is independent of interpretation or images in the mind.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is, you do not know what anything is. Period. Try to get your mind to see this. Don't just think it, experience this not-knowing.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest reasons you are stuck is because you have an image of "an external reality" in your mind. You are taking this image to be reality when it is not. This image must go.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possiblity that there is no such thing as external reality in the same way that there is no such thing as Santa Claus.

<title>The 5-MeO-DMT Mega-Thread</title>

You would need to be an organic chemist with tens of thousands of dollars of lab equipment to extract it successfully. It is a very delicate molecule. It seems easier to synthesize than to extract. And you'd need to be a good chemist to synthesize it too, with costly lab equipment.
</p>

<p>
	Also, 5-MeO is not really a motivational tool. It will likely have the exact opposite effect: it will show you that your entire life is a meaningless lie. Although discovering God was very motivating for me. But for many people it would be more terrifying than motivating.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be better off starting with something like LSD and see how you handle that. You could do years of work just with LSD.

<p>
	That is super-typical of Blue thinking. It's not even ugly from their perspective because they really believe in the whole good guys vs bad guys narrative. And of course, we are always the good guys so we can do no wrong.
</p>

<p>
	The lack of compassion comes from lack of exposure to the "bad guys".
</p>

<p>
	Excellent example!

</p>

<p>
	Under this premise, your face does not exist unless you are looking at it. And even when you are looking at it in a mirror, it still is not "yours" or "a face" because those are concepts, not direct experience. Notice that under this premise even the notion of "Truth" is not real but conceptual. Notice further than even the notion "real" isn't real!
</p>

<p>
	The first most important distinction to make is between concept/thought & actual experience.
</p>

<p>
	But then inquire further.
</p>

<p>
	By deconstructing your web of materialistic beliefs your experience will ultimately become recontextualized into Absolute Being.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute in none other than what is in your direct experience right now once you strip off all the concepts. But there are a lot of concepts to strip off. Way more than you can presently imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will help you see the Truth directly. Which will then help self-inquiry and deconstruction.
</p>

<p>
	Truth cannot be spoken because it is the the sum total of everything that is the case. You could say that Truth is the physical substrate of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with trying to conceptualize or imagine Truth. All concepts and images take you away from Truth or Being.
</p>

<p>
	That's probably because your mental image of Green is too caricatured, too stereotypical. By which I mean you're thinking of Green as some pot-smoking hippie wearing Native American feather earrings and a peace symbol necklace. That kind of person probably is Green, but that's not the only version of Green that exists.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a set of values, not some stereotypical hippie image.
</p>

<p>
	My political value set is very Green. I very much care about equality, egalitarianism, and the excesses of capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	I'm also very big into relativity. My notions of relativity are more extreme than most post-modernist academics.
</p>

<p>
	I just don't wear my Green on my sleeves, and being a lone-wolf type of guy, I don't participate in any kind of mob mentality or group activities which many Green people indulge in. Even during group meditation retreats I never meditate with the group. I meditate alone.
</p>

<p>
	I've had a Green value set ever since I was like 10 years old. I never really cared about money, I cared more about peace and art.

			2. There is no such thing as "post-rationalist", sure it's sexy statement, but it does not exist, everything is logical , and I am talking about Logic in very broad sense , I am not referring to Formal Logic or Mathematics, so I am talking about reason, you can't argue against reason because you need reason to argue in the first place, if you say logic is bad because , for example : Gödel's incompleteness theorems , you are using reason to think about Godel's theorem as an example of anti-logic or something. Realizing limits of logic is logical and reasonable so reason is the foundation of everything.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There definitely is such a thing as post-rational. You just haven't gotten there yet.
</p>

<p>
	What you are saying is still within the Aristotelian linear logical paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The point of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is that it cannot be understood via logic. It is only understandable via intuition. You think you are using logic when really you are using intuition. You cannot encapsulate Truth mechanically. Or in other words: all logic relies on intuition.
</p>

<p>
	But even that aside, there is something even deeper than Godel's theorems. Yes, Godel's work is still largely within the rationalist paradigm, however, that's just the departure point.
</p>

<p>
	The point of post-rationalism is that you stop using reason entirely, you stop arguing, you stop proving, you stop communicating, you stop thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Reason is not the foundation of anything. Reason is just word-games. The foundations of reality have nothing to do with human reason.

			Reason or Logic does not imply materialism or Scientism, of course science can't answer everything and matter may not exist, but you need Logic to understand all of this.  
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, you don't need logic to understand all this.
</p>

<p>
	And also, post-rational doesn't mean you stop using logic forever. It means you are capable of transcending logic when appropriate. Post-rational people are not irrational, nor do they reject all rationality. They are just able to go beyond it and they are aware of its limits.

<title>Are You Saying Reality is Subjective or Objective Idealism?</title>

<p>
	Subjective vs objective is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is nondual.
</p>

<p>
	Anything you could say about nonduality would be false, as all thought and speech is based on dualistic divisions like subjective vs objective, real vs unreal, existence vs non-existence, big vs small, matter vs mind, dual vs nondual, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Truth escapes all attempts to encapulate it.

<p>
	Love is being itself. Like the physical building blocks of reality.
</p>

<p>
	But this cannot be seen while through the cloud of smog of the ego.
</p>

<p>
	You have to die to see that all is love. Ego is incapable of such love. Only with death does it come.

</p>

<p>
	Mystical experiences are nice, but you need to go deeper, beyond experience to Truth itself, which is not an experience or a state.
</p>

<p>
	There are many depths to how awakened you can be. So always keep boring deeper and deeper.
</p>

<p>
	For an awakening to stick, the illusion of self needs to be thoroughly decontructed. It's very common to keep falling back into the illusion because you still haven't fully deconstructed it.

<p>
	There are a lot of great cutting-edge physics and science lectures available on Youtube these days, so I thought it would be nice if we started to pool the best ones.
</p>

<p>
	Please think twice before posting a science video here. We want really good videos which demonstrate high Yellow/Turquoise holistic science. Find videos which are really big picture or have some larger metaphysical, epistemic, or spiritual implications. I'm thinking of stuff akin to the work of visionary scientists like Einstein, Niels Bohr, David Bohm, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff that is post-materialist, post-rationalist. Stuff that's outside the box and really captures the imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Of course we shouldn't expect these scientists to really fathom nonduality. Most of them will still be materialists and still stuck in their models. But still, they will often say interesting tidbits which dovetail with nonduality.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Then after I graduated college I had to start my career and figure out how to pay my own bills. At which point I was forced to regress pretty deep into Orange. It was dirty business. Then 5 years later after integrating lots of Orange, I started to move back into Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need any money to be Yellow. Yellow is a state of mind. But if you are crippled by self-survival issues, then it will be pretty hard for your ego to go Yellow because you haven't mastered the lower stages yet.
</p>

<p>
	Preoccupation with self-survival is the chief obstacle to evolution into Tier 2.

<p>
	I have a hunch this topic will veer in an ugly direction. Sorry. I know your intention was good, but let's not focus on political issues too much here.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how every political topic turns into the ego-mind justify its rightness. This is self-bias 101. The point of our work here with self-actualization is to become hyper aware of our own self-biases and put an end to them, rather than feeding them, the way political discussions usually do.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that 99% of what your mind thinking is self-agenda unfolding. Try to find a single thought you had today which wasn't related to advancing your survival. Watch yourself like a hawk. Nothing out of your mind is to be trusted as valid, truthful, or fair.
</p>

It takes study and care to apply it properly.
</p>

<p>
	Many people are stuck in Blue, Orange, and Green. And SD is good for showing you how to evolve up.

<p>
	That's right. Spiral Dynamics does not map mysticism. Mysticism is way beyond Spiral Dynamics. Spiral Dynamics is talking about trends within the evolution of human culture and value systems.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with SD is that its inventors were not themselves mystics. So the model doesn't account well for mysticism.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber is a mystic. So he has his own models which are similar to SD but which also account a bit more for nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	As I will say in the next video, once you reach Yellow, your goal should really be enlightenment, not Turquoise or SD. Break free of the entire cycle of life and death. Put all this nonsense monkey-business to rest.
</p>

<p>
	As good as Don Beck may think SD is for solving world problems, in the end, all world problems are just a hallucination. SD is ultimately Maya. Of which you must break free.
</p>

<p>
	You guys with this Red Pill stuff... sigh... it's just garbage. It does not even warrant rebuttal.
</p>

<p>
	Reason, logic, and "scientific facts" are just being weaponized here to serve the ego's agenda. It's really just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, all politics is identity politics! That's the whole point of politics: to promote the survival of your identity. There is no truth or love or fairness in politics. It's self-survival 101.
</p>

<p>
	In the future I may start shutting down threads about JP's politics and all this incel talk. It is a distraction from actual self-actualization work.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to improve with women, go socialize with women. It's just that simple. Filling your mind with Red Pill theory or JP lectures will not get you laid. It will just make you bitter.

<p>
	Of course, because all of reality is relative.
</p>

<p>
	If you removed all the atoms from the universe with nothing left but 1 atom, you would not know if the atom was moving, rotating, or if it even had a position, or what size it was.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just that you wouldn't know, the particle would actually be motionless, positionless, timeless, and sizeless.
</p>

<p>
	When I tripped hard on 5-MeO, I became directly conscious that scale was totally relative, which meant that I as a human was the size of an entire galaxy.
</p>

<p>
	You can zoom into reality forever. Your pinky contains as much "stuff" as the entire Milky Way galaxy.
</p>

<p>
	In truth, of course, there are no such things as particles. Consciousness is infinite in all directions. Consciousness has infinite resolution and it scales infinitely. If you take 1 square centimeter of space, you can zoom into it a trillion trillion times, and whatever thing you find there, you can zoom into it another trillion trillion times, and so on, to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	You can also zoom out forever too.
</p>

<p>
	Just the opposite. A depressed person is giving meaninglessness a negative meaning.

<p>
	If you are conscious that meaninglessness is meaningless, then you won't be depressed.

<p>
	Doesn't surprise me at all. His MMA background, his macho appearance, and his comedy background makes him very attractive to Blue/Orange alpha bro types.
</p>

<p>
	Joe covers a lot of shallow pop-culture topics which attracts Orange types.
</p>

<p>
	He has a very large audience though, so I think a lot of Green people watch him too. They aren't as vocal as his rabid alpha-bro fans.
</p>

<p>
	Right-wingers just tune out Joe's Green streaks. It would challenge their stereotype of Green Libtards and SJW to admit that Joe is Green. After all, Green is supposed to be unreasonable and deluded.

</p>

<p>
	Me trying to argue against science with you would be like me trying to argue against Islam with a fundamentalist Muslim. It's pointless because you accept science as a dogma without being aware that you are doing so.
</p>

<p>
	If you care about the Truth, you will make a serious inquiry into the limits of science on your own.
</p>

<p>
	You're right about one thing: science is pragmatic. But pragmatism is the ego-mind's survival agenda, which has nothing to do with Truth or deep understanding. In an illusory world, illusion, lying, deception, imagination, and manipulation is highly effective for the purposes of maintaining and advancing oneself as an illusion.

	Flying a private jet does not preclude one from being Yellow.

<p>
	You really expect a huge celebrity like Di Caprio to fly public? He would be hounded by fanboys all day long. A guy like that needs body guards around him. You're talking about one of the most famous people in the whole world.

<p>
	With all that said, Di Caprio seems more Orange/Green to me.

	Orange Stupidity:
</p>

<p>
	The idea behind Spiral Dynamics is that you go through the stages and incorporate the previous stages into the higher ones to some extent. Given this shouldn't stage Orange have a decent amount of understanding of how religion and morality works?
</p>

<p>
	I understand that there are limits to religion and that it can be done in an unhealthy way, but from my perspective every person that i have met that is in stage Orange is extremely selfish and disconnected from "moral living".
</p>

<p>
	Take the human body as an example of a system, we know that this system called a human body operates in certain ways that keeps it healthy and strong. Proper food, sleep, prayer, fasting, chastity, and so on. But the stage Oranges seem to be extremely against any "set" rules for keeping your materialistic cravings in check.
</p>

<p>
	They will take something like casual sex or greasy fast food or alcohol and call it healthy even though we know it isn't healthy at all and is most likely going to be the thing that kills you. The same is true about business, or relationships or anything that we have a deep understanding of. Our religious leaders have long ago pointed out the evils of having a materialistic worldview. Materialism leads to a rejection of God, a mindless belief in technological progress and science, and is responsible for greed, corporate exploitation, objectification of women, sex addiction, drug addiction, food addiction, pornography, crude humor, violent video games, nuclear weapons, depression, suicide, loss of direction, broken marriages, single mothers, STDs, abortions, and much more.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't Orange corrupting the very fabric of decent society, turning it into the devil's playground? How can Orange be so stupid as to expect happiness from money, fine clothing, technological gadgetry, TV, video games, Facebook, sex before marriage, pornography, drugs, and rock n roll? Isn't Orange the embodiment of depravity and godlessness?
</p>

<p>
	Isn't this the greatest limiting factor to stage Orange? Is that they are completely ignoring how spiritual reality actually works and that's the reason they end up in so much trouble and pain? 
</p>

I know them all too well.
</p>

<p>
	You can do all the spiritual work you want, but the fact remains that PUA is an escape from the real inner work. When you get to real spiritual work PUA will fly out the window as delusional nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	I am not going to argue with you about it. You can figure it out on your own. All the points I made are still valid, despite your rebuttals.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, I don't object to talking to girls in clubs to improve your game. What I object to is the toxic anti-woman ideology that comes with it.
</p>

<p>
	PUA is like Islam. Good in theory but often ugly in practice.
</p>

<p>
	I know most of the RSD instructors. They are very immature and dysfunctional. With that said, yes, they still help lots of guys. They helped me. But you also gotta move on.
</p>

<p>
	The sad irony is, all these mens rights movements are way more ugly and toxic than feminism. Which is precisely why all this hatred of feminism exists. It's just compensation for one's own inadequacies.

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	Although it's complicated. You have to understand that mystics and enlightened people tend to reside outside Spiral the entirely.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality cannot be mapped. Nonduality is not a stage you reach. Nonduality is Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Never forget that Spiral Dynamics is just a model, and it is not designed to model mysticism, altered states of consciousness, or nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a model of levels of nonduality, Ramaji's LOC system is better suited to that. Although, still, it's just a model and will not address every facet.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly the research shows it has medical properties of all kinds.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with it is addiction.

<p>
	True psychedelics are non-addictive.

<p>
	It just happens naturally as you trip. Just surrender to the trip and the substance will take you were you need to go, whether mentally or emotionally.
</p>

<p>
	I've had powerful emotional experiences on every substance. It mostly depends on you, not the substance.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms can be very emotional for me. They tend to be intoxicating and very trippy. LSD is better for metaphysical contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	As your trip starts you can set an intention to either: 1) work on personal emotional issues, 2) work on metaphysical insights, 3) work on life purpose and a vision for your life. Just pick one and see where it takes you.

			Sooo this is what RSDtyler said a few days ago:
		</p>

		<p>
			"I keep fucking falling into this trap.<br />
			<br />
			I read posts like this, and I think "Ya I'm being too extreme".<br />
			<br />
			Then I meet a "good girl" and I try to game her without all the fuck-boy stuff ......... and I get SHUT DOWN.<br />
			<br />
			The girl will even say "I just want to meet a guy who runs a business and doesn't do drugs and has a level head" and it's like HELLLOOOOOO I'MMMM HEEERRREEEE!!!  <br />
			<br />
			And then they go date a drug addicted degenerate.
		</p>

		<p>
			I fall back into that trap because of the negative influence of this forum and mainstream society that keeps telling me "A high quality woman will appreciate a high quality guy".<br />
			<br />
			Which is just flat wrong.<br />
			<br />
			I'm a high quality guy and I like HOT women.  I often date Instagram models and strippers because they are insanely hot.<br />
			<br />
			You can laugh at this and call it a flaw in my character, but when you have a perfect 10 professional hottie riding your cock.... I gotta be honest, there are few physical pleasures in life on that level.<br />
			<br />
			So if I fall into the same trap, and I'm a quality guy I think ... then i gotta remind myself that women do too.<br />
			<br />
			And stop believing this "quality attracts quality" bullshit.<br />
			<br />
			Humans are humans.  We like to feel super super super good whenever we can.  So be a sexual guy with women and they will appreciate it.  Stop correlating all this career and personal development shit with getting laid - too idealistic, not based in how reality actually works.<br />
			<br />
			Tyler"
		</p>

		<p>
			So does Tyler mean this exclusively for having sex and getting laid at the club? So does this mean getting laid as not orange will be difficult? 
		</p>

		<p>
			Or because hes too orange value system and doesnt know better?  
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is so toxic and neurotic I don't even know where to begin deconstructing it.
</p>

<p>
	That's how the world looks like when you're at Tyler's level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness, it does not look like that.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental problem with PUAs is, they want to bang the hottest 0.001% of girls, a new one very week, and when that girl rejects him or refuses to sleep with him within 4 hours of meeting him, he gets pissy and blames her for it. Because of course PUA can't be wrong by definition.
</p>

<p>
	Are young women in their early 20's attracted to low-quality men? Of course! In the same way that people are attracted to low quality food. The solution isn't to start another McDonalds. The supermodel girls in their 20's are immature and unconscious and have no idea how to select proper mates. PUA then blames and exploits them for it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you will definitely have more sex by manipulating girls. Just like you will definitely earn more money by manipulating and cheating customers. But that's not what you really want in the end.
</p>

<p>
	You don't really want a new supermodel girl every week. What you want is 1 girl who are able to love and build a deep relationship with. She doesn't even have to be that hot. That's your insatiable ego at work.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move for Tyler here would be to say, "I will surrender my desire for sex with a new super-model girl every week." The problem isn't that he can't get girls. The problem is that he is trying to reach God/Infinity through sex/girls/pickup, and this will NEVER work. Materialism never works. But rather than admitting that, the PUA will blame the women.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that PUAs are fundamentally incapable of being in relationships because they are too narcissistic and manipulative to have an honest, intimate, loving relationship. They are too immature to be vulnerable and to commit to one woman. Many PUAs are really just sex and ego addicts without realizing it. PUA becomes just another materialist escape, no different than TV, drugs, or porn. It's a 1st and 2nd chakra activity -- driven by very low consciousness needs.

<title>Whats wrong with Sam Harris?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/23004-whats-wrong-with-sam-harris/?do=findComment&amp;comment=254238</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	There are numerous problems I have with Sam Harris:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		He doesn't understand what God is, what enlightenment is, what consciousness is, or what intelligence is.
	</li>
	<li>
		He does not understand the true origins of religion.
	</li>
	<li>
		He still clings to and advocates a rationalist morality, without being conscious that morality is a human invention and a weapon of the ego.
	</li>
	<li>
		He demonizes Islam by citing poll studies which are greatly distorted and misrepresentative. The majority of Muslims DO NOT believe it is right to kill apostates, etc. Those polls are just bad.
	</li>
	<li>
		He has built a cult following of atheists and rationalists which use Sam to justify a closedminded scientism.
	</li>
	<li>
		He still fundamentally holds a dualistic, materialistic worldview -- despite his meditation and spiritual questing.
	</li>
	<li>
		He doesn't really fathom the depth of psychedelics.
	</li>
	<li>
		He doesn't really fathom the depth of consciousness.
	</li>
	<li>
		He doesn't understand what Truth is. He doesn't understand that science and language cannot access Truth.
	</li>
	<li>
		He treats consciousness as though it is produced by the brain.
	</li>
	<li>
		He advances American exceptionalism, which is a blindness to national and cultural self-bias.
	</li>
	<li>
		He acts as though Western culture is objectively better and superior to other cultures.
	</li>
	<li>
		In evaluating the problems in the Middle East he places way too much emphasis on Islamic beliefs vs geo-political, historical, and economic factors, which are far more significant.
	</li>
	<li>
		There is no acknowledgment that Islam can be practiced at different levels of consciousness: Purple, Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow, Turquoise. He paints all of Islam as Red/Blue. This is a fundamental error. The problems which exist within Islam are NOT due to specific beliefs in the Quran but due to lack of geo-political and consciousness development in the Middle East. All of the problems in the Middle East could be resolved without changing the Quran or the basics of Islam.
	</li>
	<li>
		He places way too much importance on the content of belief vs one's level of consciousness.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is engaging in a lesser Jihad and indoctrinating his fanbase into doing the same.
	</li>
	<li>
		Seems to me like he's making more enemies in the Middle East than building bridges. It's not an accident that he gets so many death threats. Because he's try to ram American culture down people's throats.
	</li>
	<li>
		He stokes up right wing Islamophobia.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	He is the poster-child for scientism by making claims like the following: "The scientific data can't be racist." Which is quite ignorant of what "data" is. There is no such thing as data. All data is theory-laden and will of course be cherry-picked by the ego to justify its self-biases. Which is precisely the problem of scientism, and what people like JP or Sam Harris are doing. They use "data" and "reason" to be advance their biases.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see an awareness of the nuances of epistemology within him. I also don't see an awareness of how the ego-mind uses logic, data, science, and rationality to advance its agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Sam's entire rationalist philosophy is ego-based from my perspective.
</p>

<p>
	He likes to play the philosopher without realizing that Western philosophy is dead because it is all mind-based ego games. You will never arrive a Truth via Western philosophy or science.
</p>

<p>
	And the problem is that because he presents an air of authority and intelligence, people just swallow it up without realizing that they are being indoctrinated into a religion.
</p>

<p>
	From the big picture perspective, the very problems that Sam Harris is pointing out within Islam, are the very same problems he himself is falling into. There is lack of self-awareness of the mechanisms of the ego-mind. Fundamentalism isn't just a problem for Islam. It's also a problem for materialistic atheists.
</p>

<p>
	If people didn't take him too seriously, that would be okay. But his fanbase is cult-like and really believes in it.

</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that stages Green, Yellow, Turquoise basically did not exist 200+ years ago. At least that's according to the Spiral Dynamics model.
</p>

<p>
	People from 2000 years ago lived in a radically different reality and culture. They were not like us today minus smartphones and cars.

	He seems more Blue/Green to me. I don't know that much about him though.

<p>
	For starters, someone who has a sense of life purpose and doesn't play victim or whine about women.
</p>

<p>
	A man who complains about feminism isn't a real man, that's a pouting child.
</p>

<p>
	A real man has something of value to offer the woman. And he treats women well, with love and respect.

</p>

<p>
	Dating is much easier for guys than girls, so spare us your JP crocodile tears. You have no idea the kind of shit women go through.
</p>

<p>
	To expect top notch women to be handed to you on a silver platter sure sounds like communism.
</p>

<p>
	Women don't own you anything. Become a quality man and they will come aflocking.
