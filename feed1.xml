<p>
	SD is a complex model which requires serious study and contemplation to understand fully.
</p>

<p>
	All of these issues you brought are up only apparent issue because you haven't fully understood the model yet and you are not quite properly interpreting history. For example America was not more Green in the 60's than today. That is confusing the hippie movement with the average level of the entire country. In the 60's America was heavy Blue/Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Atheists are not Blue, they are just stubbornly Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Each stage builds on all the prior ones, so there is no contradiction in a Green or even Turquoise person starting a business. Business takes place at every stage, just following different values.

Those milligram scales are still way too imprecise. They cannot properly measure a 10gm dose. To them, 10mg to 20mg all feels the same. I have used several different milligram scales and they are all terrible.

	Consistency of powder is a non-issue if you're using the same batch. And even between batches is it not much of an issue unless you have totally difference sources.

<p>
	Teachers have different styles. This is why its good to study hundreds of different perspectives. Each one will expose you to some new facet that the other ones didn't.
</p>

<p>
	Teachers place different emphasis on things due to their unique personality, cultural background, path through life, and even their gender or level of testosterone.
</p>

<p>
	Never expect one teacher to explain everything to you. It just isn't possible.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, finding a teacher who you resonant with perfectly is bad because then you will tend to blindly accept what he/she says without thinking for yourself or considering other sources.
</p>

<p>
	Focus more on grasping what is being taught in your direct experience rather than daydreaming about or judging the teacher.
</p>

<p>
	The teacher you resonate with very much depends on what your particular needs are at this moment in time. In a few years, as your needs change, so will your teachers -- if you don't commit yourself to worshiping just one.
</p>

<p>
	My teachings are definitely not complete, and definitely contain some mistakes and shadow. This is not a problem so long as you think for yourself, make use many sources, and do your reading. Just listening to me is not enough to succeed in this work.
</p>

	I'm actually surprised at how successful Jed's books have been.
</p>

<p>
	He sort of bucks the trend.
</p>

<p>
	Although of course most people reading his books have no idea what he's really pointing to, or ever do the practice he suggests. He sort of obscures the practice with all his smartassery and story-telling.
</p>

<p>
	Jed's work is sort of a cult classic.

The only thing is that you haven't really gone all the way yet. You got a small glimpse, but not the Full Monty.
</p>

<p>
	When plugging, it's very important to make sure that your bowels are empty, otherwise the substance will not absorb fully.
</p>

<p>
	Measuring 5-MeO using a micro-scoop is far superior than using a scale. Scales are just not sensitive enough. Get a micro-scoop on Amazon (like this: <a href="https://amzn.to/2oguKiE" rel="external nofollow">https://amzn.to/2oguKiE</a> ) and use the same micro-scoop each time so your doses are consistent.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you might need to smoke it to get the Full Monty. Or just increase your plugged dose.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, at high doses, it gets freaky.
</p>

<p>
	But having that Fully Monty breakthrough is paramount. Until then, you still don't understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	Doing it with Octavio should definitely get you a breakthrough. Smoking is MUCH more intense than plugging. Plugging is like a walk in the park compared to smoking it. With smoking, the ego should not be able to hold on or resist in any way.
</p>

<p>
	Because no one would buy it if it said, "You gotta do 10,000 hours of work".
</p>

<p>
	People want easy answers. That is what sells.
</p>

<p>
	The popularity of your product/service in the marketplace is directly proportional to how easy and effortless you make your solution sound.
</p>

<p>
	"Enlightenment In 15 Minutes" << That's the video every fool clicks on.
</p>

<p>
	The most serious teachers, who emphasize hard work, are the ones you'll never hear of because they are not mass market.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: The Deep Problem of Marketing.
</p>

<p>
	To sell enlightenment effectively, you gotta simplify it and dumb it down to the point that hardly anyone who listens to you will ever attain it.
</p>

<p>
	If a guru told you what enlightenment really is, no one would buy it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Even just to master your career it will be important to read books from others in the field.

</p>

<p>
	Identity creates attachment and clinging, which is sort of the definition of dysfunction.
</p>

<p>
	America has plenty of unhealthy strict Blue too. Look at the Catholics, Evangelicals, and Mormons.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever a meme is turned into an ideology, into "the truth", it becomes toxic because all memes are partial and limited. They are never the full Truth.

<p>
	I guess I should have been more clear: solving the master does not merely mean enlightenment. It means solving the entire maze of your life, which is a far greater undertaking than just enlightenment. It includes mastery of relationships, career/biz, finances, art, health, emotions, etc. Even an enlightened perosn still needs to figure this stuff out, or at least to figure out that he is renoucing them.
</p>

<p>
	Mastering the maze requires detailed knowledge of the maze, which can only be acquired through books. I don't just mean spirituality books. You don't need to read 300 spirituality books.
</p>

<p>
	Therapy can of course be useful. For some people it is an important step in their path in escaping the maze.
</p>

<p>
	I am supportive of therapy. It just isn't sufficient by itself to resolve the maze.

Internal vs external is a conceptual duality.
</p>

<p>
	Generally-speaking, competition is a bad strategy for life. Be a creator, not a competitor. All competitors eventually lose because there's always a bigger fish. In the time and energy you waste competing you could have created something beautiful and valuable.
</p>

<p>
	I explain all this in the Life Purpose Course.

	Competition is such a limiting paradigm. You are fighting a war which does not need to be fought. Which is the greatest strategic blunder.

	This was obvious from the day one, even to most establishment Republicans. Trump's entire life/career is a house of cards held together with lies. From his fake hair to his fake bone spurs to his fake news to his fake university to his fake charity to his fake wife. Everything in Trump world is a cheap fake. That is Trump entire MO. Fake, fake, fake your way to the bank.

<p>
	It works great until you get your hand caught in the cookie jar.

<p>
	The problem with con-artists is that they never know when to quit while they're ahead.

<p>
	I see you guys are not actually contemplating what ideology is.
</p>

<p>
	Ideology is NOT the entire domain of thought!
</p>

<p>
	One can think and conceptualize without being ideological about it.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with lumping all thought and speech into ideology, as if there is only nonduality or ideology.

</p>

<p>
	He just represents the healthiest aspects of Blue/Green. Don't forget that Blue & Green can be very healthy. They don't have to be raving lunatics.
</p>

<p>
	What Rogers is speaking against in that video is Orange vulgarity. Orange is all for showing tits and violence on TV for the sake of profits. Which Rogers would have a serious problem with because of his Blue values of propriety and decorum.
</p>

<p>
	Just his manner of speaking is Blue Blue Blue. Formal and proper.
</p>

<p>
	"Protect our innocent children" is a common trope for Blue and Green stages.

<p>
	You assume that to be enlightened is something the ego-self acquires. Which is of course a false assumption. Just stop assuming that. You were told from the very beginning that you are an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	I don't understand people who learn this and then start to exclaim that you cannot be enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	To say that you became enlightened never meant that ego acquired enlightenment. It always meant that ego dissolved and empitness dawned. That is what becoming enlightened means.
</p>

<p>
	Why quibble over something so obvious?

<p>

<title>Why should I stop eating wheat?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Wheat is just empty calories. Why do you think everyone eats it? It's cheap empty calories. That is all. It has no nutritional value. You might as well just eat spoonfuls of white sugar. At least the sugar won't cause autoimmune reactions.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't rocket science. Just basic common sense. You are fed wheat for the same reason cows and chickens are feed grain. It's the cheapest fuel there is.
</p>

<p>
	Peasants, soldiers, slaves, prisoners, and animals are fed bread. That's what makes society run. Not oil, grain.
</p>

<p>
	That's the problem right there.
</p>

<p>
	Your business has no actual meaning for you, despite outward appearances.
</p>

<p>
	Business must be designed to serve some higher purpose than money.
</p>

<p>
	You don't actually have a life purpose yet. Making money is not a life purpose.

<p>
	You are simply lost in mental-masturbation.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing you imagine or reason about the Absolute is correct because all reason and imagination is illusion.
</p>

<p>
	So you can sit there and reason for 1000 years, but you will still misunderstand because the entire domain you're operating within is illusory and you are not conscious of it.
</p>

<p>
	No amount of reasoning can substitute for consciousness. Because consciousness is a 1st order thing and reasoning is a 2nd order thing.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be an ant pondering whether anyone can truly know calculus.
</p>

<p>
	An ant can't. But a higher consciousness being can. The solution is to stop being an ant.
</p>

<p>
	Reasoning about not being an ant is not the same thing as actually not being an ant. Which is why you cannot think your way into Truth. You must realize the futility of thinking if Truth is your goal.
</p>

<p>
	After all, nowhere in the universe is it written that thinking will get you to Truth. The Truth is under no obligation to conform to your reasoning or to make any logical sense to you. In fact, if the Truth made logical sense, it would not be the Truth.
</p>

			And now what? It seems wrong to explore the principle of concentration of force over and over again when what we want is something general, right?

<p>
	Seems to me like you're thinking about this too narrowly, too externally.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of boxing your goal is not really to beat some opponent, your ultimate goal is to become a good boxer (let us say).
</p>

<p>
	In which case, you start to strategize on that goal. How do you concentrate your limited time, energy, and resources to make yourself a good boxer over the next year? Perhaps you identify that your greatest undeveloped asset is stamina. You sense that you could outlast other boxers in the ring. But you'd need to train up your stamina to do it. And so that's where you decide to focus your energy. So you do lots of cardio training, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Alternatively, you could determine that the best strategy would be to hire an exceptional boxing coach. So you spend your energy and resources looking for the best coach you can find, in the hope that he will give you that extra edge that you need to win.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to competition, you need to find some unique thing that will set you apart from everyone else. Maybe that means you train twice as long each day, or you develop amazing legwork, or you find an exceptional rare coach, or you do lots of visualization, or you learn to meditate in the ring, or you study lots of boxing videos to learn new moves, or you do yoga to raise your baseline level of consciousness, etc.
</p>

	Gravity doesn't affect everything universally. Gravity has no affect on a fly in a video game, for example.
</p>

<p>
	The answer to all why questions is Infinity. There is an infinite chain of causes for every object.
</p>

<p>
	If you weren't under the affect of a physical ruleset but some other, you'd be asking, "But why not a physical ruleset?" And on.

<p>
	Why anything at all??

<p>
	The principles of successful dating are timeless. They do not change.
</p>

<p>
	The larger question is, why are you dating at all? For what purpose? That's where things can start to change.
</p>

<p>
	If all you care about is hooking up, the methods for that are well-documented across the internet.

<p>
	Best not to speculate about these realms. Either invest the time to explore them, or don't. Exploration of these realms is serious work and not for the lazy or faint of heart.

		<p>
			Like you can't make copy-cat businesses? I can assure you that there are tons of copy-cat models that work. Do you mean by level of potential/ success rate? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can make a copy-cat business but it's a bad strategy. It will be hard to market and eventually you will go out of business unless you bring something new to the table.
</p>

<p>
	A Seth Godin says, you must create a Purple Cow.
</p>

<p>
	The bigger picture of business that people fail to see is that marketplaces are constantly evolving and self-optimizing. If you offer something of genuine value, then you will be optimized out of the marketplace by evolutionary forces.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot go copy Bill Gates or Elon Musk. You must bring something new to the table.
</p>

<p>
	Practically what this means is, you cannot create a good business using a cookie-cutter business-in-a-box plan. This is why get-rich-quick-schemes and multi-level-marketing schemes fail. What you cannot do is follow a 1-2-3 step formula for creating wealth, because if you could, everyone could do it, but that cannot happen by definition because wealth depends on a disparity between you and other people in society. So you must offer more genuine value than other people offer. You must differentiate yourself from the poor and maintain that differentiation.
</p>

<p>
	I say this specifically because there are a lot of tempting business-in-a-box plans out there. But the ones who get rich off those are the ones selling the plans, not the ones buying the plans.
</p>

<p>
	No one can sell you a plan for how to create something like Actualized.org, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Uber, Ebay, Tesla, Amazon, SpaceX, etc. Because the plan itself is the whole value of the company. And the plan is always time-sensitive. You cannot create another Amazon today. That ship has sailed.
</p>

<p>
	The more original your plan, the more money you stand to make, the greater your competitive advantage.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can still study all these great companies and learn lessons and gain inspiration for building your own.
</p>

<p>
	It's a non-ordinary realm of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Since reality is a hallucination at all times, the hallucination can have various domains or realms like waking, dreaming, astral realms, DMT hyperspace, mushroom realms, computer simulations, schizophrenic hallucinations, hellscapes, heavenly realms, etc.
</p>

<p>
	There's really no limit to what The Great Mind can hallucinate.
</p>

<p>
	"Ordinary physical reality" is just one realm out of many. It only seems "real" because you haven't experienced any other realms yet, so you have nothing to contrast it with.
</p>

<p>
	Well... you experience the dream realm every night, but your mind dismisses that as "just dreams".
</p>

<p>
	See, it's hard to experience the non-ordinary realms if you don't take them seriously. That's where openmindedness comes in handy.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah... I thought that way too. I still basically feel that way. But life also forced me to learn what is necessary for survival.

<p>
	You categorize and group reality all the time. That's pretty much what all knowledge, language, and science is. You just take it for granted.
</p>

<p>
	You group people in male vs female, black vs white, conservative vs liberal, moderate vs radical, conscious vs unconscious, sane vs insane, friend vs foe, etc.
</p>

<p>
	What you're really objecting to is a new set of categories which you are not comfortable with yet.
</p>

<p>
	For some reason you have no problem when a scientist groups subatomic particles into quarks, leptons, antimatter, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber is enlightened and he talks about Spiral Dynamics and other groupings all the time in a very healthy and reasonable way.
</p>

<p>
	Without grouping, there is no science or math.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is a complex and nuanced set of categories which requires many hours of study to understand.
</p>

<p>
	It would help if you distinguished between healthy and unhealthy application of categories. And also if you remained mindful that all categories are human projections.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I read a few pages of Maps Of Meaning but couldn't bother reading any more. It would be a waste of my time. Hundreds of pages of academic talk which sound deep but are actually pretty shallow.
</p>

<p>
	I have hundreds of books on my bookshelf which I have to be very selective about. These days, most of the books I buy I cannot read because they are just written by people who are too low consciousness for me. I read a chapter or two and basically throw it away.
</p>

<p>
	Once in a while I stumble upon a really brilliant book written by a genius. But this is getting rarer and rarer. I sometimes wonder why I even read at all, since at this point I can basically derive all the deepest truths of life simply through contemplation using my journal.
</p>

<p>
	But I still read, holding out hope for some rare brilliant gem.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible to know and not read, and to read and not really know. Most of modern academia is just book smarts without any deep wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	Just consider, the time you invest watching JP videos about Biblical myths might be better spent contemplating your direct experience. Or not. Discover what works for you at your level.
</p>

<p>
	If JP works for you, have at it. Personally, I have bigger fish to fry.

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I understand where you're at. I was in a similar place about 10 years ago when I started doing business.
</p>

<p>
	It's not really important what my business was. Business is basically all the same: you look for new opportunities in the marketplace which are emerging, and you seize on them. It's not a good idea to copy others in business, since your success in biz depends very much on you innovating and finding new opportunities. You cannot do the things I did 10 years ago today. You need to find new opportunities. There are always tons of new biz opportunities emerging every year. But people get so preoccupied doing what everyone else is doing that they miss it. They overlook that simple point that business success is about leadership, not following the herd. Those who follow the herd in business ultimately fail.
</p>

<p>
	The whole key to business is to do lots of research and be creative and original. You must connect new dots.
</p>

<p>
	You can take various seminars, workshops, and video courses to learn the fundamentals of biz, sales, and marketing. That is very important. But then you must have the courage to go find your own unique niche. Business-in-a-box solutions do not work. If they did, every fool would be a millionaire. The whole point is that you cannot do that. You must bring something truly new to the table, which takes cleverness, which is rare.
</p>

<p>
	Be very careful doing business purely for money. Find a way to align yourself with your life purpose as soon as humanly possible.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be surprised! People actually can pay you to sit in darkness. Ever heard of Dark Room retreats? Someone's making money off that. You can literally earn money locking people in a dark room as long as you know how to convince them its good for them <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	The best advice I can give to entrepreneurs is: learn the theory of biz & marketing and then do tons of research. If you do enough research, you will eventually stumble upon your niche.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. The highest income I ever earned came AFTER I fully aligned myself with my life purpose, not when I was chasing money.
</p>

<p>
	P.P.S. I have a video about Small Business advice: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/the-psychology-of-small-business-success" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/articles/the-psychology-of-small-business-success</a>
</p>

<p>
	Starting a business will be the one of the hardest things you'll do in your life. But the rewards more than compensate for it. Business is not for everyone. To succeed in business you must be a bit of a wolf and you must have ambition.
</p>

<p>
	With stuff like this, you will never know until you try it.
</p>

<p>
	That's what experimentation and research is. It always involves risks, but also potential for great payoffs.
</p>

<p>
	I do use colloidal silver and colloidal gold. Not sure about the above product though.
</p>

<p>
	In this case it would be very easy to validate or falsify this product. Buy it and try it for a month and see if you notice any changes. If your mindfulness skill is high you should notice some changes. If not, then it doesn't work and you can move on to testing other stuff.

<p>
	You have to distinguish between verbal/conceptual truth and Truth as Being.
</p>

<p>
	There is no opposite to Truth as Being.
</p>

<p>
	Falsehood is a concept, which results from the imagination imagining something which is not currently present in direct experience, without being aware that that imaginary thing is actually an existing object (an idea) within direct experience, and is therefore technically a part of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason you can say that a unicorn isn't true is because it is True, but your mind is confusing what a unicorn is.
</p>

<p>
	A classic example of confusing the map for the territory.
</p>

<p>
	In Truth, there are no maps. There is only pure territory.
</p>

<p>
	The pure territory is the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	No, hippies are not Blue at all. They are Green.
</p>

<p>
	Blue dresses formally, properly, in uniforms and clean cut suits and dresses. Blue is all about maintaining up-tight order.

It's a rough average and depends a lot on circumstances. A stage Yellow person could be diagnosed with cancer while a stage Green person might find a great job, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Scandinavian countries rank some of the highest on the world happiness index.
</p>

<p>
	There are no stage Yellow societies or governments so we don't have a ranking for countries above Green. The prediction is they will rank higher than Green when they do emerge.

</p>

<p>
	He speaks of God way too theoretically and indirectly. As if he read about it in a book.
</p>

<p>
	He is not a mystic, he is an academic with some Christian leanings.

That's the whole point. It's a full-time job and it's quite tedious to do.
</p>

<p>
	I would focus more on content and other forms of marketing. For example, getting on popular podcasts is good for getting your name out there. Or writing guest blog posts. Or giving public speeches.
</p>

<p>
	There is no easy solution to marketing. Marketing is hard, time-consuming, and expensive because it is so valuable.
</p>

<p>
	It's also very hard to market something which isn't Purple Cow. Make sure you're bringing something new to the table.
</p>

<p>
	Success in business requires extreme creativity. You cannot just copy what other people did. You must innovate. You are being paid to innovate, and if you cannot do that, then your business will not succeed.
</p>

<p>
	Your job, as CEO, is to come up with new original strategies. That's why they pay you the big bucks (or at least they will if you succeed). This is why only highly ambitious and extraordinary people can start businesses. Most people only know how to paint by numbers and follow others. Entrepreneurship is about leadership. You gotta find cutting-edge emerging opportunities in the marketplace and creatively exploit them.
</p>

<p>
	No one can tell you what these new original strategies are. Because if they knew, they'd have your job. You gotta do lots of research and connect dots.
</p>

<p>
	It was my passion and purpose for many many years.
</p>

<p>
	Then when I actually started doing it, I saw that it didn't quite suit me. I had a thirst for something deeper. Game development is fun and very interesting (and I'm still passionate about it to some extent), but I needed something deeper. Which turned into my quest for metaphysical understanding, self-actualization, and enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose evolves. It never starts out clear and perfect. You start with your best guess, you pursue it, and then you adjust on the fly. Sometimes large adjustments are needed, like quitting your entire career. Which is what I did. Twice!

Because he has not yet developed eco-consciousness so the health of the environment is beyond his circle of concern.
</p>

<p>
	Green's care for the environment goes beyond just saving money. Green actually cares about the environment for its own sake. Green has developed heart, which Orange cannot understand because Orange is too self-centered.

<p>
	Building artificial backlinks is not a good idea these days. Google is smart about catching you and penalizing you for it.
</p>

<p>
	You can actually get your website blacklisted forever if you build too many artificial backlinks.
</p>

<p>
	That era to do that kind of stuff was 10 years ago. Google has gotten a lot smarter.
</p>

<p>
	No-follow links don't count at all, and making links on blog comment sections is a no-no these days. Google knows what you're doing. Quality links must come from the body of the page, not the comment section.
</p>

<p>
	These days I would assume that almost all social media links are no-follow. Which means they don't count.
</p>

<p>
	You are misunderstanding Green.
</p>

<p>
	Don't give Green a bad name.
</p>

<p>
	Green can be very healthy. In fact, mostly it is. Only in rare exceptions does it get toxic. These days people in the political sphere love to demonize Green and over-exaggerate Green's excesses. If you use the news or YT political commentary to judge Green, you will get a very distorted picture of Green.
</p>

<p>
	80%+ of Green people are moderate and easy-going.

			Could he be back to buying nice things for himself once he reaches yellow?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Green never really stops buying nice things. If anything, Green buys fewer but nicer things. Green people love expensive Apple products and expensive yoga pants, for example.
</p>

<p>
	Green just realizes that happiness is found more in relationships than in material objects.
</p>

<p>
	Don't over-simplify Green as being against material objects. Healthy Green is not against those things. In fact, Green should realize that life cannot work without material objects. It's just that Green understands that material objects are not what life is about.
</p>

<p>
	Green is also conscious of how buying up useless material objects affects the environment in unhealthy ways. So Green will be mindful of what they consume whereas Orange doesn't give a shit as long as it suits them.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Orange will drive a Hummer and doesn't care about how much gas he burns. Green will prefer to drive a Tesla. Tesla is a nice, expensive material object. But it is also eco-friendly.
</p>

<p>
	Green buys nice material objects, but for different reasons than Orange.
</p>

			Could you speak in more detail about this? I've seen you promote this idea of diving deep into the nihilism in several posts and I'm never quite sure why. Perhaps do a video about nihilism. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Aside from some of these Neo-Advaita teachers who encourage spiritual bypassing, you don't really see nihilism propped up in traditional spiritual practice. For example, the Buddhist middle way is precisely finding a balance between eternalism and nihilism. So what gives?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, it's very simple. All that nihilism really boils down to is that being is meaningless. Which is what nonduality reveals.
</p>

<p>
	That's all.
</p>

<p>
	But the ego-mind don't want to accept that. To the ego-mind it seems negative or depressing or chaotic.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta be very careful though. Meaninglessness does not mean what you think it means!
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to dive deep into nihilism per se. You just need to become conscious that ego-mind constructs all meaning for the purpose of its survival. Once you become deeply conscious of this, life will cease to have meaning for you (at least for a while) and it will feel like a deep depressing nihilism as you realize that all your life motivations were predicated upon lies and illusions of the deepest sort. But keep pushing past that, surrender all your illusions, and you will eventually get to pure being, liberation, divinity.
</p>

<p>
	This is what they call the dark night of the soul. It's really more accurate to call it: the final death-throes of the ego.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	JP is serving a valuable function for young college-aged males.
</p>

<p>
	He is giving them a sense of stage Blue discipline and direction which their culture never gave them.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, at his best, what JP is proposes is having a sense of Life Purpose. Which is basically what my LP course is all about.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing I would stress about that is that it's very important to realize that Life Purpose is a conceptual construction. It is not objectively true in any way. It's something one creates for oneself to live a good life and have a sense of focus. And to develop mastery in some field.
</p>

<p>
	And that there is a higher level beyond life purpose, which is awakening.
</p>

<p>
	One of the excesses of stage Green relativism is that it can leave people feeling lost, directionless, nihilistic, unwilling to engage in building a passionate life. JP seized on this Green excess and is building a public identity around it.
</p>

<p>
	But reacting against excess tends to produce more excess of another kind.

</p>

<p>
	Visualize it hardcore, like your life depends on it. Put full confidence and feeling into each of those 10 minutes. Forcing all negative thoughts and doubt out of your time for those 10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	That will fix it.
</p>

<p>
	But only if you actually do it every day.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make the excuse: "But I can't visualize it because I've never seen it." That's nonsense. You have an imagination which can visualize all sorts of things you haven't seen, like a flying rainbow mammoth. Your imagination is how you bootstrap success.

<p>
	It just requires surrender, and dropping all sorts of old ego expectations and desires.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind is transitioning from living for survival to living from Being. This is a radical shift and the ego-mind has a hard time coping with it.
</p>

<p>
	The freedom that comes from meaninglessness is very radical, but also beautiful. It is an acquired taste after decades of living in a conceptual fantasy land under all the artificial meanings that society programmed you with.
</p>

<p>
	Just give it time. The depression will pass and give way to emptiness, joy, freedom, and being-love.
</p>

<p>
	To truly awaken you are going to have to change your entire attitude towards life. Basically, life as you knew it will end, and a new life will begin. You have to have courage to surrender your old life. If you cling to it, that will produce suffering and depression.
</p>

<p>
	With awakening, you must go ALL-IN. Half-measures will produce lots of suffering.
</p>

<p>
	To try to awaken but keep your old life intact will produce lots of suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Just remember this: depression is ALWAYS temporary. It's something the mind is ACTIVELY doing, and the mind can't keep it up forever. Use this little bit of truth to weather the storm. Keep reminding yourself that this is just temporary. The ego is just acting up like a child.

<p>
	Do not make a travesty out of this process. Do not give spirituality a bad name which such egotistical stunts.
</p>

<p>
	Seriously give Kriya yoga a try. Do it every day for 1 years straight. Then see how you feel.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're not getting results is because you don't have a serious regular daily spiritual practice, so you are getting lost in the mind.
</p>

<p>
	The lesson is simple: discipline yourself to develop a serious daily practice.
</p>

<p>
	That's all. No need for hysterics.
</p>

<p>
	Either do that, or forget this whole awakening business and just go back to living an ordinary life.
</p>

<p>
	It does.
</p>

<p>
	One vs two is a distinction, a duality. Nonduality is both one and two. All distinctions are embraced at once, creating one unified field containing an infinite number of distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness and many-ness are in fact identical.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that a carton of eggs is both one and many at the same time. There is no contradiction because number is a relative projection of your mind. You're the one deciding whether you see the carton as 1 carton or a dozen eggs.

<title>Lesser Jihads vs Being a Carpet</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/24482-lesser-jihads-vs-being-a-carpet/?do=findComment&amp;comment=273140</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The Lesser Jihad isn't to be demonized, it's just a distraction, a red herring. In the same way that having a giant porn poster hanging on the wall in your office would be a distraction from getting any work done. It would be foolish to hang such a poster up in the office. This doesn't mean porn or sex is bad, it just means you have to be careful with not letting it distract you from the bigger picture.
</p>

<p>
	What you are complaining about is survival. If you feel other people are threatening you, or dehumanizing you, that's a survival issue. For example, someone might complain, "But Leo, I can't do enlightened work because I live in war zone. What am I supposed to do? Meditate while people are shooting bombs around my house?"
</p>

<p>
	The answer is: you must engineer your environment to minimize threats to your survival so that you can focus on what's really important: truth-realization. Yes, it's very hard to focus on truth-realization when you can't feed yourself, can't pay your bills, get into fights with people, have family breathing down your neck, have toxic friends who want you to do drugs and watch TV, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You must strategically extricate yourself from all of that so that you can focus on the real work. It might take you several years just to fix that part of your life so that you are in a stable place where you can focus on the real work.
</p>

<p>
	For someone living in a war-torn hell-hole, there is no self-actualization, and awakening. For them, just getting safe shelter and food is #1 priority. You cannot meditate if your life is being actively threatened.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, most threats to your survival in 1st world countries are purely conceptual and self-created. You could be a billionaire living in Hollywood and still feel like your survival is threatened every day, and so you distract yourself from ever doing truth-seeking. Survival is the whole game of life, and it feels very real at all times, and it's very addictive. Your mind's whole job is to only focus on survival at all times. Truth-seeking is all about overriding this primordial drive. Which is why it's so counter-intuitive, challenging, and rarely done.
</p>

<p>
	This is really a question about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Those who are very low on the pyramid will find self-actualization and self-transcendence extremely difficult.
</p>

<p>
	Do other people's ideologies REALLY dehumanize you? Why do you care what other people think at all? Why not focus instead on what you have control over, like meditation, self-inquiry, yoga, psychedelics, etc? Unless Nazi's are physically threatening your life, then you are probably blowing this ideology thing way out of proportion.
</p>

<p>
	Conflicts over what other people think of you are some of the biggest time-wasters. They are almost totally unnecessary and self-created, unless your physical life is seriously in danger (in which case, fix that situation ASAP and get back to inner work).
</p>

<p>
	Fighting ideology with counter-ideology is the Lesser Jihad. It is a trap, a distraction.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to be a carpet. By engaging the Greater Jihad you put yourself in the strongest possible position. In doing that, you gain all the power. Those who get far enough along on the Greater Jihad become invincible to outside forces.
</p>

<p>
	Going out into the woods and mediating for 30 days straight is the very opposite of being a carpet. And almost anyone can find a way to do it. The problem is, no one wants to because they have a bunch of excuses. And it's not fun. It will the be the most challenging thing you've ever done in your life.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	How do you know what you are supposed to be?
</p>

<p>
	Where is it written that you are supposed to be a body? Why can't you be omnipresent consciousness, and the body is just another object like all other objects?
</p>

<p>
	Does the body really have any special boundary around it? Is it really any different than a coffee table? If the body is really you, how is it possible that you can perceive the coffee table? After all, the coffee table ceases to exist if you close your eyes. So clear the coffee table is a creation of your mind. As is your body.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you trusting those bodily sensations as evidence of your identification with the body? After all, you have sensation of the coffee table (you see it), but you do not identify with it. Who says that bodily feeling is more real or determinative of your identity than colors? Why are feeling superior to colors? Who said so? Why are you blindly trusting your feelings? Who said feelings have any meaning whatsoever?
</p>

<p>
	Who said the feeling of a body = you? How arbitrary is that?
</p>

<p>
	You can split hairs over all sorts of nuances of JP's work, but in the end, it's still thoroughly grounded in the classic dualistic Christian paradigm of meaning, morality, order, right vs wrong, good vs evil, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Which is, ironically, the opposite of what Christ realized.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to realize Christ through studying myth. You will realize it through hardcore spiritual practice and deconstruction of all belief systems, morality, value, and meaning.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is, you will find Christ at the very bottom end of nihilism.
</p>

<p>
	And the distinction JP draws between the individual self and collectivism is a duality which did not exist for Christ.
</p>

<p>
	The individual self and the collective self are in fact one and the same.
</p>

	<li>
		Kirya yoga
	</li>
	<li>
		Psychedelics
	</li>
	<li>
		Solo retreats
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That is the killer combo right there.
</p>

<p>
	Getting magically enlightened at the hands of some guru is extremely rare and it's a super disempowering attitude to have. You might as well be hoping to win the lottery.
</p>

<p>
	Take your awakening into your own hands. No one will do it for you.
</p>

<p>
	If you are feeling stuck, go do a Bufo 5-MeO retreat with Octavio. You'll experience infinity in 5 minutes. It's worth the travel.

<p>
	He'd have to do at least a dozen trips, yes.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise what would we be talking about?
</p>

<p>
	Just because a person is enlightened does not mean he knows psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	It would be pointless discussing pizza with Sadhguru unless he ate some pizza first.
</p>

<p>
	This is really just common sense. People who talk of things which they have zero experience with end up saying stupid things. I know cause I've done it. I am now much more careful about what I choose to speak about so that I don't over-step my experience too much. It's a constant problem. The mind loves to speak of things which it has not experienced as though it has.

</p>

<p>
	All else is hearsay.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I do BOTH: psychedelics and lots of non-psychedelic methods.
</p>

<p>
	I was only arguing against those who oppose psychedelics on dogmatic grounds. This anti-psychedelic dogma is almost always rooted in lack of experience with psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	People do not fully appreciate just how badly our culture stigmatizes psychedelics. They take on this stigma and argue from this stigma unwittingly. Psychedelics have not become mainstream yet, so you will often find people criticizing them simply based on that.

			For example Leo made a video saying all enlightenment were practically the same. It is untrue Zen satori is just a brief awakening experience. It is not equal to the Samadhi sadhguru had. Awakening out of the mind is not the same as a flow state. A flow state is not the same as unity consciousness. That isn't the same as ego death a temporary loss of the i. That isn't the same as a NDE which apparently is permanent. Leo has some decent stuff but pretends to know more than he does.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I repeatedly stated that there are many facets and levels of depth to nonduality, and also all kinds of mystical and non-ordinary states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But this is actually a case for using more psychedelics, not less. It's precisely because there are so many facets and various kinds of states and levels of depth that without psychedelics you will almost never explore even a small percentage of them.
</p>

<p>
	There is also a confusion happening here between stages of development vs states of consciousness. They not the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Also, NDEs are not permanent. By definition, an NDE is a near death EXPERIENCE. And I've never conflated NDEs with awakening. They are very different things.
</p>

<p>
	I have repeatedly told you guys that this entire field is much more nuanced and complex than most people assume.
</p>

<p>
	And therefore, psychedelics are a great tool to explore this vast landscape and see what's up.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is that people don't want to do it. They want one simple solution rather than doing 100s of trips and dealing with all the questions they will raise in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	No one is suggesting that you trip once and close your mind down. Just the opposite. You trip more and more, with each trip your mind opens more and more.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like you're being told, "Hey, go travel to Africa, there's cool stuff to see there." and you say, "No way, it's too dangerous!" or you say, "I've been to Africa once and seen everything there is to see."
</p>

<p>
	Both attitudes are deeply misguided.
</p>

<p>
	You could trip 100 times and still not see everything there is to see. People who have tripped less than 50 times, I can't even take them seriously. They have a massive lack of experience.
</p>

<p>
	So before you ask people for advice on psychedelics, first ask them, how many times have you tripped, and on how many different substances and at which dosages and under which conditions? That will shut most people up as it would be embarrassing for them to admit their lack of experience.
</p>

<p>
	Before you even think of hanging up the phone, answer it 100 times. You never know who's calling.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever excuses you have for not doing psychedelics, that's just what they are, excuses.
</p>

<p>
	Are there dangers? Of course! Exploration of any kind is dangerous. If you want to be safe, stay in the middle of mindless herd. Exploration is for daring souls. The mindless herd will always whine and complain about why exploration is evil. Don't ask a sheep for advice on how to be a lion.

<p>
	You could form another idea, but that would be just another false identification.
</p>

<p>
	You could believe you are a unicorn, but so what?
</p>

<p>
	After all ideas are extinguished, what remains is Nothing. And Nothing is not an idea.
</p>

<p>
	Try to imagine life, but without you. Like, there is still a body, but no you inside it.

	Yes, it will shock the shit out of you.
</p>

<p>
	That's the point: enlightenment shock treatment <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	You will integrate afterwards.
</p>

<p>
	After just one 5-MeO breakthrough, you will never look at reality the same way again. Even though you will fall back into duality and ego. You will still have a memory of awakening. And that memory will serve as a roadmap for pursing awakening.

<p>
	No, it is not beyond. It is just that.
</p>

<p>
	But there are many facets to that insight and many degrees of depth to it.
</p>

<p>
	I merely said that enlightenment teachers do not understand that 5-MeO can go there as directly as it does.
</p>

<p>
	If there was a pill you could take which would give you the level of consciousness of a Zen master with 40 years of daily practice, 5-MeO would take you there in 15 minutes and possibly even give you a deeper insight into that than that Zen master has had.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, the difference is, after 60 minutes, you'd be back to normal. Whereas the Zen master is stabilized in his insight.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of 5-MeO is to give you a very deep glimpse of total nonduality. To show you how little you know and how worthwhile it is to pursue.
