</p>

<p>
	Introvert: someone who get energized being alone, drains energy being with people. Introverts make fewer but deeper friendships. Doesn't like to approach new people, prefers new people to approach them.
</p>

<p>
	Extrovert: someone who gets energized being with people. Extroverts makes lots of shallow friendships. Loves to approach new people and make new friends.

	Yes, that's my point. That makes language relative vs absolute.

</p>

<p>
	The problem with people who glibly denounce relativism is that they themselves are often the most deluded ones, thinking they've figured it all out.
</p>

<p>
	Relativism is a stage above rationalism, but there are also stages above it.

For language to work at all it requires making relative distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	You're way overcomplicating this.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute cannot be spoken or even thought.
</p>

<p>
	Wittgenstein did not fathom nonduality and his philosophy is not worth much even though he has a few great lines to quote.
</p>

<p>
	Derrida's analysis of language is much more on-point.

			Is it really so convenient to make this distinction from this point of view? Aren't we (both?) creating our own problems this way?

		<p>
			If it feels like I'm pulling your leg over something you casually said back to me, please let me know.<br />

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a very important distinction. If you fail to make this distinction you will get yourself into all sorts of trouble.
</p>

<p>
	Most everyday language is coming from and speaking about the relative domain. This needs to be clearly understood. So if your spouse says to you: "Hey, did you take the trash out?" you do not reply with, "I don't exist and trash is just an illusion."
</p>

<p>
	When a question is asked from the relative domain, the answer must meet the question where it is at.
</p>

<p>
	And as for the Absolute domain, it's really hard to speak about anyway. So anything you say about it will ultimately devolve into contradictions and paradoxes because language is dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	We do our best speaking about these things, always remembering that we will always fall short of the Truth with our explanations.
</p>

<p>
	Do other people really exist? Nope. But we must still live life as if they do for practical reasons.
</p>

<p>
	Is money real? Nope. But we still need to earn it to feed ourselves.
</p>

<p>
	Is food real? Nope. But we still need to eat it in order to keep the illusion of our bodies going.
</p>

<p>
	Is time real? Nope. But we still need to set our clocks to the same time so we can coordinate.
</p>

<p>
	In a world of only illusion, illusion becomes the reality.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When you first start, your practices will feel rusty. That's okay. Just keep doing the best you can. Don't let perfectionism interfere with your practice. Give yourself time and leeway. Trust that things will sort themselves out after a few weeks of practice.

This work is so challenging. I envy your strength.  I don't know how I can muster the strength and courage to go so deep again. Being tortured, defeated, failing God, and dragged toward Hell has no words that can be written to explain it. Not knowing who you are and having absolutely no grounding and struggling to feel supported and loved by God makes it even harder. I suppose the fact that "I'm back" shows that I am still loved.

<p>
	The ego likes to make a big epic struggle out of awakening. Stay mindful of how you're playing up the drama. It isn't necessary. You can trip calmly in a very pleasant yet profound way.
</p>

<p>
	Every trip is unique.
</p>

<p>
	One trip doesn't really say much.
</p>

<p>
	Do 30 trips and then you'll have a decent sense of the terrain and where you stand.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. It sounds like your dose was way too high. Stay at 125ug of LSD (1 tab) for now. Blasting your mind with psychedelic overdoses is counter-productive. You want to find a comfortable dose where you are able to contemplate and still remember.

<p>
	It's important to make your first psychedelic experiences pleasant, not sickening. Otherwise you'll never want to do it again.
</p>

<p>
	LSD is the better way.
</p>

<p>
	I don't take any psychedelics which would make me feel nauseous or sick. It gets in the way of the contemplating and it's totally unnecessary. The natives take it simply because they have no better options.
</p>

<p>
	Puking your guts out is just unnecessary with today's technology.

</p>

<p>
	"Gravity" is NOT an empirical observation. It's a conceptual scheme which you're using to explain many, many various kinds of empirical observations.
</p>

<p>
	Before Newton invented gravity, it did not exist. But objects did still fall downward on this planet. But "gravity" is way more than the observation of objects falling down on this planet. Which is precisely why it took a genius like Newton to invent gravity. People had been observing falling objects for thousands of years but had no notion of gravity.
</p>

<p>
	A cat clearly sees objects falling down. But a cat does not know gravity. Gravity does not exist to a cat. Although the cat is still affected by "it".

<p>
	You are mixing up relative and absolute levels.
</p>

<p>
	When I say something like, "You're missing out on psychedelics" I am speaking in common parlance. The plain fact is that people who have never done psychedelics have no idea what they're missing.
</p>

<p>
	Don't muddy the waters here with petty pedantry.
</p>

<p>
	For someone who's stuck thinking enlightenment is a waste of time, the proper guidance is: go do a psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	Problem solved. Now they will be ready to start doing spiritual practices.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you got some inner demons to work out.
</p>

<p>
	The point of tripping is not to trip once, but to trip and contemplate consistently. Whatever fears you've got need working through.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than playing around with a friend, next time, sit quietly and contemplate reality.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take the devil thing too seriously. The devil is not other than God.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful about mixing up those two. When we speak of other people we are making relative distinctions for sake of convenience.

<p>
	Precisely because it's too direct.

<p>
	The problem with enlightenment is not that one can't do it, it's that one doesn't WANT to do it.

<p>
	To want enlightenment is to already be 50% of the way there.

</p>

<p>
	This is no way to live. This is like being a zombie or a slave. So of course that will lead to depression. It's a guaranteed recipe for misery.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine instead living as though you are inside a dream or a work of art. Full of wonder and passion at every turn.

<p>
	That guy don't know jack about creativity.
</p>

<p>
	The whole key to creativity is that it produces entirely new things. Yes, it builds on itself, but true creativity is always new.
</p>

<p>
	Creativity created the entire fucking universe from scratch! Creativity is infinitely intelligent.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. And he's wrong about love too.

<p>
	Happiness is being conscious of the magnificence of existence in every moment, your mind uncluttered with conceptual baggage and petty "human stuff".
</p>

<p>
	As a child, that was you natural state. Then as you aged, your mind was brainwashed and corrupted with the petty human concerns of your society and culture.
</p>

<p>
	To see the magic in every moment of existence independent of external conditions is what you really want. It's the only thing that will truly satisfy you. Which is where spiritual practices come into play. Spiritual practices help you to develop a metaphysical connection to reality, rather than the utilitarian, transactional mode from which you currently operate.
</p>

<p>
	As a kid, your mode of interaction with reality was non-transactional. Which gave you genuine joy.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10252-tsuki/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="10252" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10252-tsuki/" rel="">@tsuki</a> The trick is that the notion of "facts" is itself already theory-laden.
</p>

<p>
	To believe in "facts" is already to buy into the false idea that there is an external objective reality independent of the subject.
</p>

<p>
	What is a fact?
</p>

<p>
	That is a good thing to contemplate.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with facts is that they are always entangled with one's mode of perception or the questions one asks. This was the fundamental discovery of quantum mechanics: there are no actual facts. There are only responses to measurements. Change your measuring stick and the facts will also change.
</p>

<p>
	Facts are in a casual strange loop relationship with who you are and your perceptual system. Such that if we change your perceptual system, or your beliefs, we can change everything you consider a fact.
</p>

<p>
	The reason people disagree with and misunderstand each other so much is because they naively assume that everyone shares the same facts. This is false. A person at one level of development & consciousness will literally inhabit a different reality than a person at another level of development & consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is co-creating "the facts", but denies that it does so. This is a radical paradigm shift from the conventional materialist notion of reality.
</p>

<p>
	To put this very starkly, when you look at an object like a tree, there is in fact no tree there. You only see a tree because that's what your perceptual system pulls out of it. If you had a different perceptual system you would see something radically different in its place. The "actual" tree is in fact a cloud of infinite potential which crystallizes based on how your nervous system pings "it". You can get a taste for this by just walking around the tree and noticing that that tree "object" contains every possible angle from which you're viewing it. Such that what the tree really is, is all the infinite ways one can look at it (not just human, but all possible creatures).
</p>

<p>
	That is correct. The bias runs very deep. It is existential.
</p>

<p>
	But not so deep it cannot be undone.
</p>

<p>
	Our life's work is undoing this knot of self-bias.

<p>
	Since it is infinite, there are no bad directions. All directions are equally great to it.
</p>

<p>
	I keep telling you guys that "bad" is a projection for your ego. Sit down and contemplate what "bad" really means when you say that word. It is an egoic word.
</p>

<p>
	Things only appear bad to you because you have a horse in the race. You are biased. But God has no biases because it has bet on every horse in the universe. But you bet on only one horse.
</p>

<p>
	If you bet on every horse in the universe, would you care which one wins?
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If it was not free to evolve in all the "bad" directions, it would not be truly free.

You don't focus on that. You focus all your attention on doing a nice slow quality breath. The timing will take care of itself. It takes however long it takes.
</p>

<p>
	Don't do yoga mindlessly. You must understand the intention and purpose of each technique. Learn WHY you are doing it, so then the technical details becomes far less relevant.
</p>

<p>
	The point of pranayama is to pull the prana up the spine. Everything else is secondary and must serve this end. Whatever that takes. Your top goal is to do the highest quality pull possible with each breath.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to think about yoga as though you are inventing it for the first time.

<p>
	10,000+ hours of industrial-grade meditation or the like.
</p>

<p>
	And even then, it's dicey. Shadow issues and developmental issues will still likey remain.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is not going to be "solved" with one technique. You need a multi-pronged approach.
</p>

<p>
	And every mind is different. For some people it will be a lot easier than for others. Don't assume all minds are the same.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It depends on how you define "ego". Ego can mean "sense of separate self", which can be fully dissolved. But ego can also mean "the self / the mind / the way you act", which is largely unchanged after enlightenment. Changing the self/mind is what development work is for.
</p>

<p>
	There is waking up.
</p>

<p>
	And there is development.
</p>

<p>
	Both are necessary and important or you will fall into dysfunction.
</p>

<p>
	Work on both. They synergize nicely.
</p>

<p>
	You blindly believe other people exist.
</p>

<p>
	99% of all your beliefs are blind faith. So what's one more gonna do?
</p>

<p>
	No one is asking you to believe in chakras. Yoga is a practice. You do it and see what happens. It's like looking inside a microscope. No one cares what you believe. You just look in the damn thing with enough openmindness to accept whatever shows up.
</p>

<p>
	It might take you a few years of looking to really see what's there. In the meantime, be radically openminded.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, you never asked this question about all the current nonsense you believe. You just swallowed it gullibly.
</p>

<p>
	You never asked: "Why should I believe in the number 5? Does it really exist?"
</p>

<p>
	99% of the things you think exist, don't. So what? Somehow you are still able to wake up in the morning and get things done.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Contemplate that which is in your direct experience, like, What is suffering?
</p>

<p>
	And stop infecting your contemplations with scientific concepts. You have never seen estrogen. You may as well be talking about the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
</p>

<p>
	You are not being asked to quantify anything. Looking at what a thing is is not the same thing as quantifying it. These are two very different activities.

What's best for one person is worst for another.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, Kriya yoga is the most powerful technique I've found so far besides psychedelics. But that's me. I spent many years trial and errorring.

<p>
	I am not doing Navi or Om Japa as they take too much time and my routine is already over an hour long. I prefer to do more pranayamas instead.

	Navi might be good later on if you feel like you have an energy block in your 3rd chakra.

Look, it's reading this sentence right now and understanding it!
</p>

<p>
	But that's just the tip of the iceberg of how smart the universe is. It was smart enough to create itself. Think about that for a moment.
</p>

<p>
	Then notice, you are the universe thinking about how it created itself!
</p>

<p>
	It really helps to reframe your entire metaphysics of what reality is. Rather than thinking of reality as a dumb box of bouncing balls, think of it as an infinitely intelligent disembodied mind. Once you make that reframe, it's no longer puzzling that the universe should be intelligent. Intelligence is just fundamentally what minds do.
</p>

<p>
	The universe was not born as dumb matter. It was born fully intelligent. Because that's what reality is! There is no option for reality to dumb, other than by acting stupid through application of infinite intelligence to trick itself.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than thinking of the universe as a thing which starts out at 0%, think of it as a thing which starts out at 100% and dumbs itself down. So it's not that intelligent apes evolved, but rather than infinite intelligence was dumbed down to create apes, ants, humans, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that God is a really good method actor playing an ape. That's you! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> The method actor is so good he can dumb himself down to any level below infinity, precisely because he is infinitely good.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to think of it this: try to imagine why the universe wouldn't be infinitely intelligent. And then realize, there's nothing that would stop it. So it became infinitely intelligent. And here we are. Everything exists because there is no one to enforce any rules upon reality. So reality overflows into an infinite number of directions and dimensions.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize that dumbness is equally as impossible as infinite intelligence, you'll understand why infinite intelligence exists.
</p>

<p>
	The question you should really be asking yourself is: Why did I ever assume the universe was dumb?
</p>

<p>
	Your mind might protest: "But how was intelligence created?"
</p>

<p>
	To which you should tell it: "But how was dumbness created?"
</p>

<p>
	That's not a rule, that's a loose generalization.
</p>

<p>
	Careful not to turn Maslow (or any model) into a limiting belief.

The original Kriya involves visualizing prana moving up and down the spine, which I think is very important. Just breathing while focusing one the 3rd eye or crown is not good enough for me. It feels more powerful to focus on moving the prana up the spine. But that's my take. You could be different.
</p>

<p>
	Gamana's books are not designed to teach you Kriya from scratch. They are designed for people who are already well-versed in the core practices.
</p>

<p>
	The original Kriya book I recommended is important.

</p>

<p>
	It's much more common that people have an enlightenment experience and then fall back asleep. This can happen over and over again until the ego finally cracks for good.
</p>

<p>
	And even so, the mind will still be there, with all of its conditioned patterns (karma, samskaras). Those patterns are largely from the ego, so they will keep playing out the ego's "stuff" even if the ego is seen through.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like when you cut the head off a rattlesnake, the head can still bite you <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

</p>

<p>
	There is also the question of degree of awakeness. Not all people are equally awoken. Some are far more awoke than others. Most so-called "enlightened" people are only mildly awake.

<p>
	Do your pranayamas slow and deep. When you get good, one inhale should last like 30 seconds, then 30 seconds for the exhale.
</p>

<p>
	You want to slow your breath down as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	In certain meditative traditions they try to slow down the breath down to 1 breath per minute. That's sorta the goal here. Make each breath count. Really visualize & feel that prana flowing up the spine, through each chakra and up the brain stem. That's the key IMO. You are rewiring the brain stem, the reptilian part of your brain which keeps egoic consciousness locked in.
</p>

<p>
	As your practice improves your breathing should slow down and deepen, your visualization should become more clear and precise and filled with feeling.
</p>

<p>
	Practice slowing down your intake of air as much as possible, and practice perfecting your visualization.
</p>

<p>
	That should give you 80% of your results.
</p>

			The book says not to do Kriya Supreme Fire until one is able to hold it for at least 90 seconds. For now I can't even hold it for a minute. So at the moment I haven't started Supreme Fire yet, I'm only doing the rest of the routine stack, and I'm practicing holding the breath to get to 90 seconds over time. Did you start doing Supreme Fire anyway holding it for as long as you could and then built up to 90 seconds over time, or did you practice holding the breath first with preliminary techniques like Kriya Bow?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I would just start it where you're at, and you will work up to 90 seconds pretty easily within a month of practice.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let perfectionism get in the way of learning the practices. Tis better to do yoga poorly than not at all. Within a few months all of these complicated-seeming techniques will become second-nature.

</p>

<p>
	Wipe the slate clean and start your contemplation on this question again.

<p>
	Do that every day for 7 days and see what happens.

</p>

<p>
	There is a fine line between smoking and vaporizing. Proper vaporization is tricky to acheive. Which is why I prefer plugging.
</p>

<p>
	Placing the 5-MeO on some herb (not weed but something neutral like mullein) will make vaporizing a lot easier. A glass pipe like the Glass Vapor Genie is idle for that.
</p>

<p>
	I'm doubt 5-MeO will vaporize in a cheap electronic vaporizor.

</p>

<p>
	I usually ponder for a minute, then write a bit down. Then ponder for another minute, then write a few more sentences. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can write quite a lot once you're on a roll. But be careful not to write blindly without contemplating. Your writing must be grounded in direct experience, or it will devolve into spectualation and grand theory-building.
</p>

<p>
	Don't just ponder in your head, also ponder on the page.

<title>Are context and content actually one?</title>

<p>
	Content and context are actually distinct things. But that is a challenging topic for another day.
</p>

<p>
	In that video I didn't actually get into what context is. I only defined it loosely for the purposes of explaining the phenomenon of recontextualization.
</p>

<p>
	To really understand context, you will have to contemplate: What is context?
</p>

<p>
	It's a lot more profound than people realize.
</p>

<p>
	In the ultimate end, everything is ONE, but it is very good to look at context in isolation.
</p>

Notice how differently Deepak responds to Trump vs the way Green might respond to Trump: by hating Trumping.
</p>

<p>
	Green hates on haters.
</p>

<p>
	Turquoise loves on haters.
</p>

<p>
	That's a very significant paradigm shift and takes a lot of consciousness, development, and selflessness to embody. Green is not there yet. Green's ego is still too triggered by Blue/Orange to see the bigger picture.

<p>
	Just hanging around Green people, or even just listening to Green people can be very helpful for outgrowing Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Check out the Youtube Channel, Majority Report. They are very Green and love to ridicule Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Just be careful not to get trapped in Green.

	That's where the hard spiritual work begins.

	That's why you have Vipassana, yoga, Actualized.org and all these other "silly" practices and theories.

<p>
	It's weak sauce. A drop in the bucket compared to the power of Kriya. His online course is mostly just meant to recruit new people. It's not going to transform your life.
</p>

<p>
	That's not so say it is bad. You just have to understand that the reason I chose Kriya was because it is the most potent thing I could find. It's yoga on steroids.
</p>

<p>
	With the size of Sadhguru's organization, he cannot teach the most powerful techniques to noobs. He has to teach weak mainstream techniques as introduction. I'm sure he also has powerful techniques, but you won't get those without jumping through all the hoops.
</p>

<p>
	The popular a spiritual teacher or teaching is, the weaker it must be. The best teachings are very niche and they are not advertised on YT to mouthbreathing noobs.

<p>
	Definitely
</p>

<p>
	I feel like I'm on a mild psychedelic high throughout the day if I just sit still for a minute.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya is like microdosing psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	It also significantly calms the monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	It only takes a month or two to start to feel that. At least for me. Your results may vary. I have done a lot of psychedelics over the last 2 years, so I am much more conscious than I would be if I was starting Kriya from zero.

	Don't recall exactly which book it is from. I think it's the Kriya Supreme Fire. You basically just breath in, do the 3 locks, then hold it for 90 seconds (or as long as you can).

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	When I speak of contemplation, it includes conceptual understanding. Be careful about reduce contemplation to "just sitting in silence". That is not contemplation, that is meditation. Which is great, but not the same thing as what I described in my latest contemplation video.
</p>

<p>
	When you question something like "What is science?" that is CONCEPTUAL! Just sitting in silence will not result in a deep understanding of how science works, for example.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful about boiling contemplation down to being in a nondual state.
</p>

<p>
	One way to think of contemplation is that it is a way of cleaning up and clarifying your conceptual understanding. Which can be very valuable in and of itself. Without contemplation the mind is very confused and murky.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful, people can use the word "contemplation" to mean very different things.
</p>

</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Exploration phase: where you learn about and sample lots of various methods. Little results but lots of options and new ideas.
	</li>
	<li>
		Consolidation phase: where you get serious, buckle down, choose a few methods to master, and get to work. Lots of results but kinda boring and grindy.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Both are important.

<p>
	Sure
</p>

<p>
	Although don't make contemplations always about you. That in itself can sorta feed the ego. Make sure you're also contemplating things which are not directly about you, like, what is language?

<p>
	By that logic, you should stop doing meditation too.

<p>
	It's a nice start, but not nearly deep enough. It's still mostly intellectual understanding and the ego is still in near total control of your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Keep questioning deeper until you stop feeling like you're inside the body or the head. Until your heart starts to pound in terror at the prospect of death. And then keep questioning even deeper until you actually die.
</p>

<p>
	In self-inquiry your job is nothing short of collapsing all of physical reality. Keep questioning until the floor beneath your feet disappears.
</p>

<p>
	This is a level of questioning most people do not think is possible. It should get very intense. It requires enormous presence and focus. Focus like you intend to burn a hole through a steel plate with your mind.
</p>

<p>
	But at the same time also be gentle. Don't strain yourself.
</p>

<title>Ego Death Confusion (Conscious Surrender?)</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	It can be painful but also not. It all depends on how you look at it.
</p>

<p>
	Surrender for me is usually very mellow on psychedelics. I just surrender my life and die. There is no great struggle, no drama, no epic ordeal.
</p>

<p>
	But it won't be like that for everyone. The more conscious and developed you are, the less struggle and drama there will be.
</p>

<p>
	When it is realized that the ego never existed, there is no struggle with the death process. It feels totally organic and it is no big deal.
</p>

<p>
	If you are making a big deal out of death, that is ego resisting, and that is itself the only obstacle, the very thing to surrender.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga helps a lot to pacify the ego-mind and all of its drama.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind will naturally want to turn this entire enlightenment process into an epic ordeal. That's ego being ego.
</p>

That's the punchline of any joke, which is what causes the laugh. You realize the context was other than what you initially thought.
</p>

<p>
	Which is also why a lot of people laugh after enlightenment. It's like the mother of all jokes.

<p>
	It's not dogma, it serves an important physiological function, but you can add it to your routine later on.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing is to get your basic routine into place, so you're seeing results from it and you're happy with it. Then you can add on the extravagant bells and whistles. I would spend a few months building up your basic routine (Mahamudra + Pranayama + Breath Of Fire) before investing a lot of effort into the tongue exercises. You can always add those later. Don't let anything hinder you from building your core routine. The core routine alone is very powerful and you should start to feel it working on your mind within a month or two, which should give you motivation to keep building on top of it.

<p>
	I would say it's Blue/Orange going into Orange but in a neurotic, unhealthy way. Maybe it devolves into Red too.
</p>

<p>
	The whole show is basically about Walter gaining his independence from society and personal power (which is Blue --> Orange), just in an unhealthy way.
</p>

<p>
	It reminds me of the standard PUA arch: lame anti-social guy learns to pick up girls and devolves into a manwhore, corrupted by excessive ego and power.

<p>
	Black mold is very unhealthy and it will screw up your health and your ability to do consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	It's very difficult to self-actualize when you are unhealthy, so fix all your health issues ASAP.

The whole point of self-inquiry is to discover what you are for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Keep digging deeper and avoid asking others to tell you what are. That is a big trap in this work. The answer cannot be given to you. If it could, I would have already done so and you would already be enlightened. But it does not work that way. No one can enlighten you.

<p>
	It can be very helpful, but also a potential trap.
</p>

<p>
	Some people are much more paranormally attuned than others. Genetic factors probably play a big role. I am not one of those people.

</p>

<p>
	To even start approaching enlightenment, stop judging.

</p>

<p>
	The ego loves to whine and complain about all the stuff it doesn't like.
</p>

<p>
	Surrendering opinions and desires is a good practice.

</p>

<p>
	They are two totally different things.
</p>

<p>
	The judging you want to avoid is: condemning a thing as "bad" or "evil", which carries with it a negative emotional charge. This kind of judging wishes that the "bad" thing not exist. It's basically a crusade against evil. Which is pure ego in action.
