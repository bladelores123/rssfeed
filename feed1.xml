<p>
	Ironically, suicide is usually an act motivated by survival. It is motivated by suffering. And suffering is survival.

<p>
	Pretty accurate stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Of course TES metaphysics was taken from Hindu philosophy, which tends to be quite truthful.

<p>
	Sam Harris is a good real world example of what happens when a stage Orange person has some mystical/nondual experiences.
</p>

<p>
	It's not all that deep. Rather surface level spirituality. But still better than nothing. At least he advocatesÂ for meditation. But he does not understand the full depth of this work.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of wokeness.

<p>
	I don't read fast nor do I skim books. I tend to read books in their entirity.
</p>

<p>
	Reading many books takes 10+ years. It's a long-term project.

You are taking this completely for granted.
</p>

<p>
	A human simply cannot be at all unless as God pretending to be a human. God has to play stupid so to speak because there is and never could be an actual material reality.
</p>

<p>
	Creation is imagination and illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Your deeper issue is that you are not doing serious self-inquiry so you are not conscious that you are God. This problem cannot be solved for you in any other way but to awaken. You will NEVER figure it out mentally as you are trying to do. All your reasoning will be wrong and irrelevant. So do the practices! This is not a matter of philosophy.

<p>
	A) You just haven't fully understood what you experienced. It takes a lot of experience (trips) to get your bearings straight. You can't make sense of consciousness/reality/God in one or two trips. That would be like trying to understand the ocean after two dives. Simply not enough experience.
</p>

<p>
	B) You are currently in a state of delusion.
</p>

<p>
	C) Nothing is bullshit proof. Truth requires consciousness and care.

</p>

<p>
	As soon as your present state of consciousness changes, everything you hold to be true and correct will simply disappear as though it never existed.
</p>

<p>
	You are unwittingly trying to ground reality in something -- anything -- which preventsÂ you from realizing that the Absolute nature of reality is groundlessness (AKA, infinity).
</p>

<p>
	What the LSD was showing you was truer than what you are presently conscious of. But it was too radical for your mind to integrate/understand. So as soon as your state of consciousness dropped (after the LSD wore off), you fell back asleep.
</p>

<p>
	Your mistake is assuming that your present state of consciousness is the highest/truest one. It is not. You are currently asleep and trying to figure out reality from a state of asleepness. This cannot work. It leads to delusion. It's as though you are using a cracked microscope to look at reality without realizing that you are the crack in the lens and therefore you are the source of the distortion.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to do a lot more LSD and seriously contemplate what reality. Your work has barely begun.
</p>

<p>
	Right now you are under a spell of self-deception. But you do not know it even when I tell you this. That's how strong yourÂ self-deception is. It's total!

<title>Will vs free will</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/35496-will-vs-free-will/?do=findComment&amp;comment=436360</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Free will vs no free will is yet another duality.
</p>

<p>
	The way the whole question is framed is fundamentally dualistic and silly because it assumes there is more than one entity.
</p>

<p>
	If there only exists one entity/object, does it have free will or not? See? It's an absurd question because anything it is, is identical with its will. There is no other outside it thatÂ could control it. The whole notion of control breaks down because control requires two objects: a controller and the controllee. This cannot hold if nonduality is the case.
</p>

<p>
	Being and Will turn out to be identical inÂ a nondual state of consciousness.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	See, if you were deeply conscious, those habits would break your integrity and connection with the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you lie and steal while doing enlightenment work you will not get very far. Your lying and stealing will catch up with you. Karma 101.
</p>

<p>
	That guilt you feel is your soul telling you that you are not living up to your highest potential as God.

That was a glimpseÂ of the Ox's tail. A nice samadhi experience.
</p>

<p>
	It goes way deeper, so keep tripping keep exploring, keep questioning, keep trying to understand what Consciousness/God/Absolute/You are. Explore all the many facets of the Ox.

<p>
	Horrible is a judgment coming from survival.
</p>

<p>
	Truthfully, horrible does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is "good" in that is totally frees you of all such judgments.

<title>Can thoughts be signs?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Affirmations will of course not resolve the fundamental issue of duality orÂ ego. But they can be a good intermediate technique. Not every technique has to be existential.
</p>

<p>
	This work requires nuance.

</p>

<p>
	The mind is a very powerful thing. When it's misused it can create all sorts of problems, even physiological ones.
</p>

<p>
	Start a daily meditation habit which will teach you to let go of your thoughts and tame your monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	Of course is you are doing something in your life which can cause cancer, like smoking or eating lots of processed meat, then you should also cut that out. But don't obsess over it.
</p>

<title>how do we find the specific concept we're surviving?</title>

It's not merely the ego in general. It's a very specific ego. The ego of you! Your particular self/psyche. The thing that makes you uniquely you.
</p>

<p>
	You are never going to describe your psyche fully using language. But as you study your own survival you can get an idea of what your psyche is up to, what is needs, what itÂ wants, etc.
</p>

<p>
	So the goal is not to perfectly describe your self. Rather just become more and more familiar with it -- in the way you might get to know a child.
</p>

What you worry about tends to become true simply because you obsess about it so much.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to improve your life when you're constantly in fear.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to change your thoughts to love-based thoughts and shift your state to a more positive, optimistic, empowered one.
</p>

<p>
	Research Law Of Attraction.
</p>

<p>
	You want to create a positive, exciting vision for your future. Stop focusing on what you don't want and start focusing on what you want to create.
</p>

<p>
	Negative stuff can always happen, but constantly worrying about it is not a solution.
</p>

<p>
	You're just not getting it. You are like a donkey who is being told 1+1=2 but you're not getting it.
</p>

<p>
	It requires a leap in consciousness. You can't get it at your current state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	So maybe do the practices rather than arguing.

<p>
	Your question is thoroughly riddled with dualistic assumptions. Language is unavoidably dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	You are assuming Truth can be captured with language, but it can't because language is a small subset of Truth.

<p>
	Absolute Truth cannot be spoken, thought, or imagined.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot be qualified in any way whatsoever. You cannot even say of it: "It cannot be qualified".
</p>

<p>
	What you're unwittingly trying to do here is capture the Truth in some framework, which cannot ever work because Truth is infinity and it escapes all attempts at capturing it. This is just the nature of Truth/Infinity/Absolute. Hence the Zen-like riddles and paradoxes.

<p>
	Mother's love can be extremely conditional, as many kids can attest.

<p>
	It is a myth that mothers automatically accept their children. If only that were true.

			Then again though, what about you? You still have a business that, as far as I imagine, you seem to really care about the impact you have in yet you still pursue awakening and have found that balance to do both at the same time. How have you reconciled that in your own life? Not to get too personal here.

<p>
	As my blog post shows you, I have not reconciled it.

<p>
	I can't really answer that.
</p>

<p>
	You just gonna have to walk your path and see where it leads. Part of the process is letting go of control or the need to plan it out or have a safety net.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta trust that you'll sort out the obstacles as you encounter them, not beforehand. That's life. Life's gotta be lived. It's a visceral experience. Get more comfortable with improving and letting things unfold organically. Experiment. Trial and error. Adventure.

<p>
	Yeah.... fear is a bitch.

<p>
	The solution to fear is to be fearless.

<p>
	Some do, some don't. At that point is hardly matters. And yet some of them still work to make an impact. That's the paradox of detachment.

<p>
	Don't disagree. Sit down and observe what suffering actually is and why you create it.

<p>
	Suffering arises out of resistance. Resistance is pure survival. If you did not care about survival you would not resist or suffer.
</p>

<p>
	Death isn't a real thing. You imagine it to maintain your false identity.

<p>
	What you have to understand is that those who reach such a radical degree of selflessness are not doing it out of a desire to have an impact. They are doing it because they seek the highest Truth, and everything else is just an organic consequence of that.
</p>

<p>
	To become that selfless would require that you drop all personal desires, including any desires to change the world. All attachments would have to be surrendered. The irony is, your ability to impact the world skyrockets when you come from a position of total detachment and selflessness. But the detachment has to be real. You have to surrender everything before you get it all back in the end.

<p>
	All suffering was to ensure you lived a long life. Of course in the end all life comes to nothing. But there is a big difference between living 0 years and 80 years from your POV.

<p>
	It's a common defense mechanism, especially at first.
</p>

<p>
	Do inquiry after a good rest/nap, when you are max alert. Don't do inquiry at the end of the day when you are dead tired. Inquiry must be done at the peak of your day, not as an after-thought.

<p>
	Smoking is harsher than plugging.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging doesn't produce visuals, at least for me. Unless it's a really big dose, but even then the visual is: everything become infinite. It's not a psychedelic visual. It's more like pure consciousness being aware of its own infinitude. It's like a transparent sort of visual. Like the air got sucked out of the room and every object became infinite.
</p>

<p>
	At higher doses there's a freaky effect called recursion:

	<a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion" rel="external nofollow">https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion</a>

<p>
	Don't close your eyes during the trip.

<p>
	Actually it's the most common scenario that even after an awakening or two the identity still stays.
</p>

<p>
	Very rarely is the identity totally transcended. Usually a spiritual identity is created. This happens even with many gurus, monks, and yogis.
</p>

<p>
	To transcend all identity completely is a very rare and challenging thing.

<p>
	That doesn't matter. It's still survival even if it's deluded or wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Someone pursuing enlightenment to escape suffering, for example, is doing it out of survival. Now maybe he happens to finally reach nirvana, where survival is extinguished, but that's distinct from how/why he got there. His motivations were still survival-driven in this case.

<p>
	Yes, it would certainly work, and work powerfully.
</p>

<p>
	But be careful what you wish for. Depending on how many inner demons you got, it could get hairy. But then again, that's where the real growth is.
</p>

<p>
	There tends to be an inverse relationships between growth and comfort. You can't have both at once.

</p>

<p>
	Maybe start off by doing a 2 or 4 week solo retreat and see how that goes. That shouldn't cost you too much.
</p>

<p>
	After that re-evaluate your results and priorities.
</p>

<p>
	No one can tell you what's worthwhile for you but you. It's always smart to make small strategic bets and testing the waters before going all-in.
</p>

<p>
	Do a 1-week program before you sign up for something that's months long. Most retreat centers have short 1-week programs to get you a feel for the place and people.

	This is extremely common. Unconscious survival strategies tend to backfire and become self-destructive. They lack the intelligence necessary to navigate out of a complex situation.

<p>
	When it comes to improving with women, the RedPill/MGTOW/incel survival strategy is to blame women for that man's problems. It's the victim strategy. This is a very effective strategy for staying your old self. See, if incels and such took full responsibility for their problems they would have to admit that their inner game is the problem. This would mean lots of work to fix it, and if you failed, it would be on you. It would mean you're weak or lazy or unintelligent. This is difficult for the ego to accept and deal with. Instead the ego would much rather not change and blame someone else: women, society, feminists, SJWs, etc. This quickly becomes an appealing ideological position, similar to radical Islamic sects.
</p>

<p>
	Getting good with women can be very emotionally challenging. So most incels instead create elaborate victim narratives and justify those narratives with bro science. Then they don't actually have to go out and talk to girls. They can sit at home and make toxic online posts against feminists. Of course this will not effectively resolve their problem. But they are not conscious enough to see that. They are addicted to their fear-based, hate-based ideology. The ego gets off on it. Admitting that you've wasted years of your life subscribed to a false, egotistical ideology is too much to admit for most incels. So they double-down on it and attack even more.

			I take LSD or something like that, i experience something that i have never experienced before. Logic can't say it is this or that because that experience doesn't rely on logic to be true and thus it is immune to logic. Those needs for survival then have a great chance to use this weakness for their benefit and claim "well this experience means this and that" which benefits them of course, logic and anything else can't say anything against it. So it becomes a truth in the sense that is claimed and not been proven wrong on that level of awareness. Only another need for survival can go against it since they have such free conditions to exist unlike logic.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, the ego-mind will try to co-opt glimpses of Truth/Being for its own purposes. Which is why the most advanced spiritual teachings have typically been held secret, only revealed to qualified, mature, serious students under the expert guidance of a master.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is prior to logic, so logic must always be subservient to it. You can have Truth without logic, but you can't have logic without Truth.

<p>
	You can't become totally limitless so long as you have a human body. Being human is a very particular limited thing. You cannot escape that entirely until physical death.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose is that you are experiencing what it's like to be human. Until that runs out.

<p>
	Keep in mind that in many of these places you actually spend more time working, cooking, cleaning, socializing, etc. than meditating.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the most effective and direct path, find a cabin in the woods and live there for 6 months by yourself. Then you can get some real work done. Even just 1 month totally solo will be life-changing.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest work is done solo, where you have zero social obligations. All you gotta do is handle your food, water, and cleaning.

			I don't like to complain, but I must say that it has been extra-hard for me to get into intimate relationships. I tend to isolate myself from other people, and lose interest in friendships and socialization. At the same time, I crave for intimate and meaningful relationships. 3 years ago I started reading PUA and trying their techniques. I ended up with a few hookups but realized afterwards how artificial and false these relationships were. Now, when I start talking with some girl, the energy just wears off after some time and I lose interest and isolate myself. I've accepted this karma, and tried heavily to dissolve it with Sadhana. I am now trying Psychoanalysis. What am I not seeing? What am I missing?Â Â 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, I can't tell you what is right for you. But it sounds like you've simply not done enough work/experience with it. Remember, that relationships are what you make of them. If you put in no enthusiasm you will get none back.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe you just want to be a celibate monk. I dunno. That's a fine path, if that's what you truly want.
</p>

<p>
	But for most people intimate relationships are the way to go. You can always become a celibate monk later in life after you gain more experience with relationships & sex.
</p>

<p>
	I think becoming a monk is only proper for very serious people who know what they're doing. It's not right for most ordinary folks.

</blockquote>

<p>
	To be an effective Bodhisattva one must be enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Holding off one's own enlightenment is not the proper understanding of how to be a Bodhisattva.
</p>

<p>
	Christ and The Buddha are prime examples of how to do it right. They did not hold off their enlightenments.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to save the world while one is unenlightened is a dangerous game to play. One needs to be firmly rooted in Truth & Love, with minimal ego and shadow.

<p>
	Here's a meta-thing for you guys to notice:
</p>

<p>
	All your opinions about gender are a function of your survival. Because gender is central to your identity. None of these opinions have anything to do with truth or reality, but rather about self-definition. Notice that.
</p>

<p>
	Gender is one of those hot-button issues like religion or politics because it's so central to one's fabricated identity. The more fabricated a thing is, the more it must be defended, argued, and justified.
</p>

<p>
	Your opinions will be precisely whatever helps you survive and get your needs met. That's what opinions are!
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can be a great way to take your growth to a whole new level.
</p>

<p>
	But also don't neglect your sexual needs. At your age sex is healthy and good. Just do it responsibly. Get you fill of it. Get a girlfriend. Enjoy it for fucks sake. You're only human. You ain't ready to be saint just yet.
</p>

<p>
	Burn through some of your karma. You're young. You've got time.
</p>

<p>
	Don't view sex as a dirty, bad, or unholy thing. Sex is very holy when done right. Even masturbating is holy! Enjoy it. Stop judging yourself for it. Watching some porn is not going to destroy your life or even keep you from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all sex is masturbation. Since there is only one entity is existence. Sex with anyone other than yourself is metaphysically impossible! Lol

<p>
	Not a belief at all. You're just not conscious yet that "the brain" is a mental construction within consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	See, your own biological birth is a mental construction. It only happened because you say it did. If you stop saying it, it will stop being real. The only way you could be born is by imagining it. And thus you were born!

<p>
	There is no universe. You're inside a hallucination. Don't believe it. Take a close look. The truth cannot stay hidden from those who seriously look for it.
</p>

<p>
	YES! The Truth is very radical stuff. You have no idea how radical. Nothing I say could convey just how radical it is. Whatever you imagine is not radical enough to be True. Since human imagination is merely finite.

<p>
	Hell is just God deeply separated from itself. God cannot stay separated from itself forever because Unity is the highest truth. All roads lead back to Unity.

<p>
	Tell that to Elliot Hulse.
</p>

<p>
	Being a gym rat aligns well with MGTOW and RedPill.
</p>

<p>
	Gym rats are not exactly the most evolved males of our species. Very chimp-like they tend to be.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Orange guys tend to be into hyper-macho self-images which of course means hitting the gym, bro. It's a phase, bro.

<p>
	The very thing you fear the most: delusion, is the very thing you created with your fear. That's how fear works. What you fear you end up creating.
</p>

<p>
	The proof is readily available if you run some google searches. But you don't want to of course. You want Daddy to do it all the work for you.

<p>
	You're always free to not survive.
</p>

<p>
	Try it and see what happens.

<title>Why do I feel that my past was a lot better when it was filled with distractions?</title>

<p>
	Everything looks nice in retrospect. Even the shittiest things. Because you conveniently ignore the suffering and egoic restlessness which was present.
</p>

<p>
	Nostalgia is a great trick of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Also, as a child and teen you didn't have to worry about your survival as much. Which meant you could just BE. Now as an adult you live in the conceptual future all the time, constantly worrying about and strategizing about how to survive. This entire cycle of survival is inherently unfulfilling and disconnects you from BEing.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to whitewash how neurotic and unconscious you used to be. How much you used to suffer. It's easy to forget after lots of consciousness work. You literally cannot remember what it was like to be you 10-20 years ago.
</p>
