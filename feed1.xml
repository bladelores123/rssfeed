The top locations are: nightclub, bar, daytime cafe, busy sidewalk, mall, crowded restaurant area, college campus, etc. The bigger the city you live in, the better the locations will be. Small city locations suck.
</p>

<p>
	Then it's just a matter of seeing ones you like and doing a direct genuine approach with a light-hearted, positive vibe. My favorite opener is: "Hey, I just saw you walking by and I found you attractive so I decided to come meet you. So here I am."

<p>
	You're still not getting it: duality IS unity!

<p>
	The distinction between duality and nonduality is a duality you imagined!

<p>
	The nature of duality is nonduality. The nature of nonduality is duality.
</p>

<p>
	When you make a distinction between duality and nonduality, you live a dualistic life.

<p>
	When you make no distinction between duality and nonduality, you live a nondual life.

<p>
	And if you make a distinction between these two lives, you live the dualistic life.

	That fear is a good sign and totally expected.

<p>
	But also, be open to outside-the-box career configurations. In today's world there's no reason why you'd have to do live performance unless you wanted to.

<p>
	It's fairly natural that if you follow me, like my work, and shell out $250 for my course that you will be similar to me in many ways. At the same time, you will be different from me and your LP will not at all be expressed in the way I express my LP.
</p>

<p>
	Just look within and make sure you are staying true to yourself, not just aping me. If you are being true to yourself and it happens to look like what I'm doing, that's not a problem.
</p>

<p>
	Also make sure that you are partaking of other sources beside myself. The problem with relying too much on one source is that your mind isn't given enough variety of input to produce a truly original output.
</p>

<p>
	Copycatting is a problem of lack of diversity of input. For example, an aspiring film director who's in love with George Lucas films so much that he only watches George Lucas films is doing himself a great disservice and will end up a copycat.
</p>

<p>
	Creative people need to vastly diversity their inputs, otherwise their output will be unoriginal. That's one of the reasons that I literally study 100s of obscure sources. I have no interest in being a cookie-cutter Tony Robbins clone.
</p>

<p>
	Teach yourself how to be creative outside the box. There are so many different ways to express a common set of values or even the same career choice: like being a life coach. You can be a totally unique life coach if you do it right.
</p>

<title>about Neo spiritualism</title>

<p>
	If you're serious about spirituality, read the top rated spirituality books from my book list.
</p>

<p>
	That's all you need. And then PRACTICE!
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with this idea of "studying" spirituality. Spirituality is not meant to be studied, it's meant to be lived. The ego-mind loves to study stuff without actually changing itself.

Don't stop now! You don't necessarily have to settle this question immediately. You might want to give yourself some space to explore your top 2 or 3 possibilities with some small bets (see video about Small Bets) and see which one you like more. You could also potentially find a way to integrate several things together, like becoming a consultant or artistic director, which would allow you to have your hand in multiple cookie jars.
</p>

<p>
	Honestly, though, it sounds like you're overlooking the obvious: music. Your heart is telling you MUSIC! but your mind is scared to actually do it. By definition making a decision means cuts off certain possibilities. By choosing music you are saying No to other things. And that's how it should be. That's what creates a clear sense of purpose. Otherwise you're unfocused.
</p>

<p>
	Re-watch the videos in the course about FEAR. Fear is one of the biggest obstacles here.
</p>

			I'm having trouble reconciling this. I want to let go, surrender, and listen to the part of me that wants to align with passion and service. Is it not ok to <strong>want</strong> to make the world a better place?Â I just want to make sure that this is not still the Devil in disguise. How do IÂ trust that my life decisions are correct when the devil has made meÂ fail so many times?

<p>
	Don't get ahead of your skiis here.
</p>

<p>
	For practical purposes, yes, you CAN rely on your intuition and follow your genuine passions and your heart. We might call this the "higher self" or "the soul". This is still not the full True Self, but it's good enough to bootstrap your life.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it is okay to want to make the world a better place, just don't go overboard. Don't turn it into a mad crusade. And don't neglect your inner work, the Greater Jihad.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it can be useful to explore your subconscious mind and to integrate various fragmented parts of your psyche. It's not the ultimate solution, but it's a decent starting point.
</p>

<p>
	You have to realize that this work has many parts. Not everything is about awaking up. There are also more practical aspects to life and even to your mind and psychology which need to be worked on. For example, maybe you have some childhood trauma that needs to be ironed out. This not going to enlighten you, nor will it end all your suffering, but it's still important to do because all of that psychological baggage adds up and constricts your ability to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	There is no escape from the devil. The forces of devilry are always at work. So you must always stay vigilant and study the devil's ways. But at the same time, don't get paranoid. Generally speaking, follow your heart. Sometimes the devil will trick you even when you try to follow your heart. That's okay, you will get better and better at avoiding his tricks.
</p>

<p>
	And with some deep enlightenments, the devil's grip over you will significantly diminish. Not totally, but significantly.
</p>

	He wasn't talking about awake people. He was talking about inwardly-oriented people.
</p>

<p>
	Research shows that about half of heroin addicts and alcoholics are people in search of awakening, but not knowing that what they seek is God, they find a pseudo-God in the heroin or alcohol.

<p>
	So what Tolle is saying is that.

<title>Difference between Contemplation and &quot;armchair&quot; philosophy</title>

</p>

<p>
	Observation leads to new insights. These insights can be both verbal and non-verbal. It's okay to start with verbal ones. That is valuable still.
</p>

<p>
	As you deeply examine and question fear, new distinctions will form. For example, you could notice that fear has a significant mental/conceptual component, as all emotions do. Emotions are NOT just perceptions or sensations. Emotions are conceptual constructions.Â For example, fear is only possible when your mind is thinking of the future. No future, noÂ fear. No mental imagery, no fear. If you observed fear closely, you'd notice that, and much more.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is that you assume that you already know what fear is. You assume that what you see after 5 mins of observation is in fact what is there. That is NOT the case! Your mind is not allowing you to see what's really there because of all the conceptual filtering and cultural knowledge which is clouding your perceptions.
</p>

<p>
	As a rule of thumb: nothing you see with your eyes or feel with your body is to be trusted as a raw given. It's all heavily interpreted and conceptually distorted.
</p>

<p>
	For example, look at your hand. It is not a hand, as you assume.
</p>

<p>
	When examining fear it is useful to ask additional questions like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is the purpose of fear?
	</li>
	<li>
		What are the components of fear?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is mecessary for fear to exist?
	</li>
	<li>
		How and why do I create fear?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Be careful not to anticipate what the answers to these questions will be. You must actually do the observation and see what happens. The answers will often surprise you.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe one day you'll discover that fear is an illusion <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Notice that you are not even conscious most of the time that you are afraid. And you experience fear MANY times per day.
</p>

I use breathe strips to help widen the nasal passages. You could also experiment with various decongestants like FloNase or Xclear. Or at least blow out your nose before you start.

<p>
	Just practice sucking in air slower. As slow as possible.

<p>
	I just timed myself. One in-breath takes me 22 seconds.

<p>
	That's not extreme for a person who's awakening.
</p>

<p>
	All of the above are typical and to be expected if you're getting serious about spirituality. In fact, that's sort of the point of doing spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	That kind of stuff is not unique to psychedelics. You can get that from yoga, meditation retreats, self-inquiry, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Do you want results or not?
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is a radical process.

So in that sense, would the teen years be a sort of "peak" of open mindedness for people within culture, where they're just old enough to know a lot about the world but not too old to have fully conformed? I think that's what I'm getting at here.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, I wouldn't say that. You're generalizing way too much here. There is enormous diversity between different teens. You can't speak of teens as one object.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking teens are less developed than adults in all categories.
</p>

<p>
	Teens are quite stupid, reckless, and immature. There are some rare exceptions, but even they are still very under-developed. That's just the nature of being human. A human being does not become mature until basically age 25-30. Which is why rental car companies do not rent cars to people under 25.
</p>

<p>
	I would not trust anyone under 30 years of age to be mature. It's really that bad.
</p>

<p>
	And these days kids are getting stupider. They are being indoctrinated by digital media from age 5. So don't think you're safe.

<p>
	So what's your question?
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue charity is not very inclusive and often just a trick of the ego-mind to make itself feel righteous and moral.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Green empathy is more powerful, although still not completely selfless.
</p>

<p>
	What you're really talking about is Love. Your capacity to love will increase the higher you go up the Spiral, the more developed and conscious you are.
</p>

<p>
	True Love is not really possible without awakening, which is beyond the Spiral entirely.
</p>

<p>
	The obstacle to Love is self.

</p>

<p>
	The True Self wants nothing. That's the paradox. By wanting nothing you get everything, and by wanting stuff you are forever trapped in a cycle of fragmentation and self-created hell.
</p>

<p>
	But also, within every devil there is a tiny 1% part which wants to return to God. That is what allows for the devil's salvation.
</p>

<p>
	If you weren't a fragment, you couldn't exist. See? In order to stay alive you MUST fragment yourself. If you stopped fragmentation you'd be dead! The way you've set up life is, you've defined fragmentation as "life" and unity as "death". So you're busy all the time avoiding unity. You are terrified of unity because it would mean the loss of the fragment you call you.
</p>

<p>
	The devil is just a fragment of God!

<p>
	Teens are hardly emotionally developed. The only thing they've got going for them is that they haven't yet been full brainwashed by culture. But that happens very rapidly by the end of the teenage years. As a teenager most of your concerns have to do with fitting into culture and being a good little conformist sheep. So your brainwashing is almost complete. You basically brainwash yourself to avoid feeling like a weird outsider.

<p>
	Knowing is possible, but it is never the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Truth cannot be known, it must be not-known or Be-ed.
</p>

<p>
	It is the in fact the case that you do not know what anything is. You've only managed to convince yourself that you know. For example, you do not know what a chair actually is. The situation is so bad that you don't even know what you are. What you have a false identifications and images, none of which is what those things actually are. A chair is not your image of a chair, and you are not your image of yourself.
</p>

<p>
	All of your so-called knowledge is just images, not the actual thing itself. Take a look.
</p>

<p>
	All knowledge is relative, never Absolute.

<p>
	Be careful speculating about people's health issues, especially when you do not know them. It's very easy to judge someone's health condition without being in their shoes.

<p>
	Don't confuse ordinary notions of "perfect" with transcendental Perfection.
</p>

<p>
	Reality isn't perfect, it's Perfect. Perfect with a capital P is an Absolute. It does not depend on any metrics, values, or standards. It's Infinite Perfection -- perfection without a standard.
</p>

<p>
	In the Absolute sense, reality is not evolving towards anything. It is and always has been an eternal infinite singularity. Evolution is only a illusion of the ego-mind's linear, temporal, causal way of looking at the world. Evolution is relative.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The problem I have with starting a big spiritual community is that if we started it today, myself and everyone here would get all excited and spend the next 5 years pouring all of our time and energy into building its external infrastructure without doing the internal work that we really need to do.
</p>

<p>
	It becomes the lesser Jihad, a convenient way of not doing the lonely work.
</p>

<p>
	And I am not interested in that. I am interested in pouring my time into deep awakening and self-mastery.
</p>

<p>
	After that is complete, maybe then there could be talk of a community.
</p>

<p>
	I was very hesitant to even launch this forum and I have since considered just closing the whole thing down.
</p>

<p>
	Distraction is one of our greatest enemies in this work. Do not underestimate distraction and devilry.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you focus on doing the internal work until you are so awake you have no need of anyone or anything. Be wise in how you allocate your time and where you put your efforts. No external achievement will solve your fundamental problem.
</p>

<title>Are We Getting Better or Worse As A Society? (Steven Pinker)</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Better and worse is a dualistic illusion. Everything is always Good.
</p>

<p>
	From the ego's perspective, society is getting less oppressive overall. But the paradox is that Pinker's ideology creates a justification for endless capitalism and materialism, which keeps society from becoming even less oppressive and more equal.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that what Pinker says is wrong per se, it's that it's only half of the picture.
</p>

<p>
	Like if I told you, "Today I saved a little puppy from getting run over by a bus. I took it home with me."
</p>

<p>
	But what I don't tell you is: "When we got home, I threw the puppy into a pot and made myself a delicious stew."
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind loves to tell half-truths to make itself look good.
</p>

<p>
	Right. Because that is the True Self!
</p>

<p>
	The point of Neti Neti is to negate everything but the one thing which cannot be negated: existence/consciousness itself.
</p>

<p>
	That emptiness is your true nature. It's what you were before your body/personality was born.
</p>

<p>
	So now just sit and quietly observe that existence/consciousness. But make sure you aren't getting attached to any kind of forms or images of it. Images of it are not it. You must be it directly, without thought or image.
</p>

<p>
	Via Negativa is not minimalism. It is the path to God through total self-negation, AKA Neti Neti method.
</p>

<p>
	This should not be confused with material minimalism.

</p>

<p>
	I would look more into how to heal whatever emotional trauma you had in your childhood or early adulthood.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like your ego is resisting the profound metaphysical truths the psychedelic is trying to share with you. You have to be comfortable surrendering yourself.

<p>
	There's a very predictable course of action many people here will take:
</p>

<p>
	1) At first you are skeptical of Actualized.org
</p>

<p>
	2) Then you fall in love with Actualized.org
</p>

<p>
	3) Then you start to hate Actualized.org so you can distance yourself from it.
</p>

<p>
	4) And finally you come to understand that everything is inevitable and it could not have been otherwise.

	Skimmed over your long story, but this plan of yours sounds super dysfunctional and will lead lots of bad karma.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you re-collect yourself, ground yourself, and begin building a quality life from ground zero on solid principles, not based on fear and doing stuff to please other people.
</p>

<p>
	Truth and integrity are some of your greatest assets as a human being. Don't squander them.

<p>
	Both. You should feel subtle weekly gradual effects and eventually some bigger breakthroughs. The gradual effects can really add up. Which is the whole point. I am more interested in Kriya for the gradual effects than the breakthroughs. I can easily create breakthroughs via psychedelics, but they don't stick so well. Which is why Kriya is important.

<p>
	There are no tricks to focus other than focus.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to seriously work on it, you can start doing concentration practices like I talk about in my video: Concentration vs Meditation
</p>

<p>
	I guess Modafinil is an easy trick for focus. But you shouldn't rely on it too much.

<p>
	This is normal and it's tricky. The whole trick is that you need to be able to use existential questions to inform your everyday life, but you also need to be able to partition everyday life from existential matters. It's tricky to explain how to do this. It's like a selective filter you can develop.
</p>

<p>
	One of my most important least-appreciated videos is this one: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/balancing-theory-vs-practice" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/articles/balancing-theory-vs-practice</a>
</p>

<p>
	Where I tried to address this point. This video made many subtle points that few people understand. I recommend watching it several times and really contemplating each point.
</p>

<p>
	Getting really good at converting theory into practice and practice into theory, without getting stuck in either, is like a super-power.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Also, the 'how' to get something done is one aspect of things, but something else I'm struggling with is the 'what' and even the 'why?' What criteria should I use when choosing what to do with my life? How can I discover a direction for myself and trust myself to come up with the right one? Is the answer basically an avoidance of pain and a pursuit of pleasure? The avoidance of suffering? I'd imagine your life purpose course is good for this one. Intuitively I feel the answer has something to do with 'creating' as that's an act of love.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It will take you lots of reading, research, and life experience to figure out which things in life are worth pursing. Although I've also addressed this a lot in my videos. Like this one: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/65-core-principles-of-living-the-good-life" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/articles/65-core-principles-of-living-the-good-life</a>
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the LP Course would save you years of groping around in the dark.
</p>

<p>
	No, the answer is not avoidance of pain and pursuit of pleasure. That's what you're already doing, that's what every ego is doing, and it rarely produces good results. You might almost say the answer is the opposite: you must face the things you resist facing.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, creating and love are important pieces of the puzzle.
</p>

You need to be able to both compartmentalize them but also allow one to inform the other.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to practical survival issues like: pursuing sex, finding food, getting a job, running a business, etc. Don't get too philosophical. You can find practical how-to advice and books on each of these topics which can give you step-by-step instructions on what to do. Yes, these books are filled with concepts, but concepts are highly useful, which is why they are everywhere!
</p>

<p>
	Your ability to pursue sex, food, a job, business, etc. has little to do with Truth. Most of those things are accomplished through pragmatic action-taking. You don't need to know the Truth to drive a car successfully. It's just a skill you develop. This skill has right and wrong ways of doing it (relative to the result you want to get). Driving a car successfully requires you obey certain rules. For example, you cannot press the breaks and the gas at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	Relativity does NOT mean: anything goes. If you want specific outcomes, there is a right way and a wrong way to go about it.
</p>

<p>
	There is also Absolute Truth, but this has little do to with achieving simple practical outcomes. You need to be able to distinguish relative and absolute truths. I've have a video about this in the future. Survival and success are accomplished through relative truths.
</p>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/8351-cepzeu/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="8351" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/8351-cepzeu/" rel="">@Cepzeu</a> You are missing a few important points:
</p>

<p>
	Firstly, not-knowing. It is okay to say "I don't know". In fact, that is the truth in 99% of cases. So in the case of the Earth or a conspiracy theory, the correct answer isn't to grasp at straws, pretending to like you know something you don't. Just admit, "I don't know if the Earth is round." That is the truth! This is not at all the same as being a FlatEarther. The problem with FlatEarthers is that they definitely believe the Earth is flat and that a round Earth is a vast evil conspiracy by elites.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, learn to distinguish more clearly between belief, experience, inference, and not-knowing. Find the referents of each of these in your experience. Notice when something is a belief for you, when it is an experience, and when you genuinely don't know. For example, how many pounds do I weigh? The truth is, you don't know. So notice that, rather than trying to guess or make shit up.
</p>

<p>
	The key mistake that people make when it comes to epistemology is that they refuse to admit not-knowing because it seems like a bad thing. Culturally we are expected to know, otherwise we are told we are bad or stupid. Well, this is just bullshit. Most people who claim to know things actually are in a worse position than not-knowing, they have wrong knowing.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Reality cannot really be known. Being is prior to knowing. So get used to a lot of not-knowing. Not only is not-knowing not bad, it's the Truth!
</p>

<p>
	Notice that nothing you know about reality is what is (by definition). Knowledge is that which separates you from what is. All knowledge is conceptual. All concepts are symbols. All symbols are not what is. Truth is found non-symbolically.
</p>

	All scientific and social knowledge is relative, probabilistic, partial, and highly fallible. Nobody actually knows how many people there are on this planet. Nor is it really possible to know because by the time you finish counting them, some of them will have died and new ones born.

	It ain't just a problem in Islam. Any society below stage Green will have patriarchal views of women, womanhood, and femininity.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are a patriarchal species up until stage Green.
</p>

<p>
	Even in America this problem has not be fully resolved. About half the US population is not evolved enough to understand feminism.
</p>

<p>
	Your views of sex and gender roles are pretty much a straight-up indoctrination from whatever culture you grew up in. Notice you are just like a monkey following the herd. You have almost no original thoughts of your own about gender. Monkey see, monkey believe, monkey do.

<p>
	It would definitely be offering systemic solutions.
</p>

<p>
	Read some of the systems thinking books from my book list. That should give you lots of ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Most businesses are not offering systemic solutions to root problems, they are opportunistically seeking max profit.
</p>

<p>
	For example, McDonald's doesn't care about solving systemic problems in human nutrition.

Nevermind what you fear will happen to Germany, what do you actually wish to create? Do you want to create a more Spirally-informed world? Do you want to help people understand each other more simply because that's what you're passionate about? Then do that. That is valid.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make your LP a reaction to anything happening in the world, especially politically.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it more like this: If the world was just fine, what would you enjoy doing?

</p>

<p>
	True happiness isn't what you think it is. True happiness is Truth.
</p>

<p>
	See? Without Truth you do not know how to distinguish between true vs false happiness. Without Truth, you literally have no idea what you are doing. So of course tragedy and catastrophe follows. Which is why really wise people value Truth above all else.

<title>Difference between Contemplation and &quot;armchair&quot; philosophy</title>

Contemplation must be grounded in something: being / direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	To understand how grounding works, see my video: What Is Actuality?
</p>

<p>
	Here's how you understand contemplation: contemplate the question, What is fear?
</p>

<p>
	To do this, you must actually pull up a direct experience of fear and observe it. Armchair philosophy would be theorizing about what fear is. Contemplation would be actually observing fear in your direct experience as it is happening, or perhaps a memory of it.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation is very similar to observation. It must be grounded in the present moment. You must "feel" into what is actually there. If you're still at the level of concepts, that's not good enough.
</p>

<p>
	What is fear REALLY, ACTUALLY?! Not your ideas of fear, but actual fear! Take a good long look and see what pops up.
</p>

<p>
	Once you get good at contemplating something tangible like fear or pain, then you can begin contemplating more abstract things like time or existence.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can want truth. It's actually very important in this work. But you must be extremely careful not to confuse your egoic wants for want of truth. Wanting actual truth is very rare. Mostly when people say they want truth they are lying to themselves. They have confused egoic ideas of truth with actual truth.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with wanting truth is, since you don't actually know what the truth is or means, how can you really know want it?
</p>

<p>
	Even so, it is possible to want truth simply for truth's sake. But that means stomaching the costs to one's ego.
</p>

<p>
	If the truth would kill you, would you still want it?
</p>

<p>
	If not, then you don't really want truth, you want a fantasy of truth (AKA, you want falsehood).
</p>

<p>
	Running and managing a healthy high-consciousness institution is a full-time job. More than that, it requires the commitment of one's whole life. It's not an easy thing to do well and requires enormous levels of development.
</p>

<p>
	I am not developed or conscious enough yet to do this. Nor are most people here.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you focus your energies on developing yourself before you get too carried away with transforming the world.
</p>

<p>
	The videos are designed to be an efficient and cost-free way of learning. You don't really need a brick and mortar self-actualization institution. What you really need is do the inner work. Which of course no one wants to do. Going to a school and passing tests is not it. The whole trick with this work is that it's so delicate and personal it cannot be easily institutionalized.
</p>

<p>
	It's good to have a sense of life purpose that inspires you, but you must also be very careful not to get ahead of your skiis here, or you will easily create a cult which will hurt lots of people.
</p>

<p>
	I have deliberately held off from growing Actualized.org into a big institution. The impulse to do it is always there. But my higher wisdom says No. Making a big organization leads to unconsciousness and devilry.

	It's usually easier to develop the cognitive line versus the other lines. So you can be cognitively at Yellow but you're not actually able to fully embody it, you're just thinking from it whereas the bulk of your life and emotions are run from Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Why listen a lot to my videos you will start to think from Yellow, but very likely your embodiment will very poor, at Orange or even below. Such is the nature of doing this work through YT videos.
</p>

<p>
	You're always gonna know more than you can embody.

It will basically feel like hell. And I doubt it is sustainable for years at a time because you're gonna run out of essential supplies like food and water.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to plan it out very well and you'd have to select a spot which has sources of food and water.
</p>

<p>
	I know some yogis, for example, live on coconuts which grow nearby them. This kind of thing is easier to pull off in tropical countries I think.
</p>

<p>
	It's much more realistic to live in a small remote cabin which offers heat, small kitchen, pantry, toilet, shower, etc.

			JC recommends putting attention on each Chakra as you breath in and out. Apparently there is also a prana energy flow. To me, this feels really awkward. At times, there is a vague sense of prana flow, yet when I am imagining spots in my sacrum, belly, sternum etc. it seems like a fantasy disruption. It's like I'm trying to coordinate breathing, images of energy flow, sensations of energy flow and images of individual Chakra centers. Is it ok to just imagine energy flow up and down the spine? Rather than trying toÂ imagine the energy passing through an images of my sacral vertebrae, then moving on throughÂ the abdomen chakra, then passing through the heart chakra etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not so hard to do all that. Just visualize the prana as an electrical fluid flowing up the center of the spine and hitting each chakra quickly along the way.
</p>

<p>
	What is so hard about that?
</p>

<p>
	Your sense is vague because this requires months of practice to get is sharp.
</p>

<p>
	Even moreso than visualization, I would literally try to FEEL the prana shooting up the spine. FEEL it, and it will become a reality soon enough. This is a case of mind over matter. Don't sell your mind short.

	You say this now only because you happen to feel good right now.
</p>

<p>
	Let's see how you feel when your dog dies, when your Mom gets cancer, when you lose your job, when you get into a car accident, when someone steals your stuff, when you start to age, when your health deteriorates, when you run out of money, when you have to face death.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea yet just how much life will make you suffer. You feel good right now, but that will definitely not last.
</p>

<p>
	Wake up!
</p>

<p>
	This is a total lie.
</p>

<p>
	That person in actually unhappy 95% of the time.
</p>

<p>
	Be ware of how you are so miserable in life you are too unconscious and scared to even admit your own misery.
</p>

<p>
	It is impossible to be unconscious and happy. Period.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically, it takes consciousness just to realize you are unhappy. As but one example, notice how you constantly live in fear. Every day of your life you have a constant cloud of fear and insecurity hanging over you. Fundamentally you feel incomplete and incapable of facing life. Fundamentally you feel broken, not good enough, and unlovable.Â This is not something that happens occassionally. This is the theme of your entire life!
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Do not fool yourself into thinking that any external material acheivement will ever change the above sitution. No matter how much money or sex you get, you will still be afraid, broken, and miserable. And eventually you will want to kill yourself because nothing you try will fix it. That is, unless you know about spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	The devil lies to himself that he is happy being a devil. Therein lies his tragedy. If only he would admit he is a devil, there would be hope. But he is too blind and arrogantÂ to see it. So he continues living in his own self-created hell, calling it heaven.

<title>Joseph Campbell worth reading as a teen?</title>

<p>
	Hero With A Thousand Faces was one of the best books I read as a teen. It had a big impact on me and I still have fond memories of reading it.
</p>

<p>
	But don't expect it to be super practical like a how-to book. It is abstract, high-level wisdom which takes real thought to implement.
</p>

<title>Can &quot;you&quot; Win the Lottery Through Paranormal ability?</title>

<p>
	Paranormal abilities do not work like that. They are not so precise that you can use them that way. It would be like asking, "Can I use my intuition to win the lottery?" No, but you can use your intuition to create a billion dollar business.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of paranormal abilities as material abilities.

	Hence the beauty of plugging. The dose is as precise as an IV injection. And you get 5-10 minutes to get yourself comfy for the blast-off. And the come-up is silky smooth, yet strong as fuck at a decent dose. And it lasts way longer, allowing for much better contemplation and integration. It also has no nasty smell or taste.
</p>

<p>
	I will verify it with N,N-DMT and let you guys know, but for 5-MeO-DMT and 2C-B it works amazing. Folks who aren't plugging are really missing out on a beautiful thing.

			I dabbled with kriya some time ago but I found Leo's suggested posture to be extremely uncomfortable for me.

			MyÂ legs go numb pretty quick and it becomes more about fighting pain than actually doing the practice.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've tried slight adjustments like the height of the seat but my legs still don't agree with this position at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			I tried to get used to it for like two weeks but finally gave up.

		<p>
			Would practicing with another posture likeÂ vajrasana (which looks like this: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/yI1iIMc.jpg" rel="external nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/yI1iIMc.jpg</a>) be much less effective than what Leo recommends?

	Finding a comfortable sitting position is very important. I would say, just find any sitting position you feel comfortable with which allows you to sit for a solid 60 minutes with minimal discomfort.
</p>

<p>
	Right now I've changed up my sitting position to using a Zen-style seize bench with some extra cushioning. So for the pranayamas and breath of fire I am sitting on my knees using that bench. The Mahamudra is done without a bench obviously. That's what I found works best for me.
</p>

<p>
	You could even just do it using a comfy chair.
</p>

<p>
	Again, don't let technical details get in the way of your core practice. Once your core practice is established you can always fine-tune it, change positions, add stuff, remove stuff, etc. But you need the core practice ASAP.
</p>

<p>
	Just get both versions of your substance (freebase and HCl) so that you're flexible in how to administer it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let practical minutia get in the way of your spirituality. A breakthrough is always worth it.

</blockquote>

<p>
	There is no you to protect.
</p>

<p>
	Your question is predicated upon egotism. You are looking to survive. But there is no survival from the Absolute perspective because the Absolute cannot be killed.
</p>

<p>
	You're not getting yet that death is impossible. The only thing that dies are illusions, so there is no problem -- unless you're identified with being an illusion -- in which case you've got a BIG problem.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to change what you're identified with being.
