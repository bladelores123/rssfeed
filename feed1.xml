			theyre trying to do something similar with the bosnian pyramids. I still cant decide if they are legit pyramids or not, i went to the seminar where semir osmanagic presented himself, and they talked about how women would actually try to conceive a child in pyramid, because of the pyramids transmission powers, the baby born will become 'enlightened' much more easier. Not sure how much i believe this, but there certainly no doubt is something powerful about the giza pyramids. Why hasnt someone tried to replicate it else where, exactly how they made the giza ones (with the limestone cover&all), to test theories out?

	Cause under the materialist, rationalist paradigm such things are impossible. So why invest billions of dollars in hocus-pocus?

It's worth listening to Hitler or Bin Laden. But you have to understand how to understand what you're hearing and put it into proper context and avoid the trap of subscribing to ideological positions in service of self-survival.

</p>

<p>
	1) That whole "I am struggling to kill myself... this is so difficult..." is itself a farce. It's the ego over-dramatizing its own death. It's the final form of egotism to overcome. The ego loves to make a big deal out of dying.
</p>

<p>
	2) Tap into love. It conquers all fear. Including the fear of death. When you feel like you cannot go any further, tap into love and let it overtake you. Push, but let go of control.
</p>

<p>
	Peterson is distracted in the Lesser Jihad. He is wrapped up in waging an intellectual crusade, and his followers are doing the same.
</p>

<p>
	All of these issues of men's rights, liberalism, capitalism vs Marxism, etc. are issues of self-survival. Which is orthogonal to consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness has nothing to do with intellectual crusading. Consciousness reveals that all intellectual, moral, and idealistic positions are false, and ultimately obstacles to the solution of the worlds problems.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move in this case is to drop the desire to argue and turn inward.
</p>

<p>
	All criticism is untenable. Anyone who takes their own criticisms of anything in reality seriously has not awoken. Criticism comes from the arrogance of thinking you know what is right and that you are in control.
</p>

<p>
	Classic self-deception traps. All of this I explained in my Self-Deception episodes.

<title>do they have a legit spiritual practice? By having this</title>

<p>
	Careful with the Hare Krishnas. They have a big collective ego and they will brainwash you with their dogmas. Regardless of any spiritual benefits which you might accrue (and there probably are some great spiritual benefits to their practices).
</p>

<p>
	You want to be spiritual without becoming a group-think zombie.
</p>

<p>
	Practices alone are not the only factor. The other factor that's really important is inclusiveness and broad understanding of all spiritual traditions, without attachment to any particular one.
</p>

When you closely observe your inner nature, you will come to the same basic conclusions. The parallels exist because anyone who studies human nature honestly will tend to see the same core principles at work. It's really just a question of how deeply you go down the rabbit hole, and how you choose to express your insights, from within which cultural background.

	Just consider the possibilty that there are many many many many degrees to it, and very very very very few people have ever seen the deepest degrees.

<p>
	When you think you've reached the deepest, you probably haven't.

	Awakening is not really logical in the end. It will not make sense to you from within the ego.
</p>

<p>
	The key point is: you cannot locate yourself no matter how hard you look. Notice that. That should make you very suspicious of this thing you call "me".

	FYI, you can become a monk/yogi totally solo, without joining any group.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is only for those of you destined to be hardcore mystics. This is not something to attempt casually.

	This is all fine and good, but do not confuse emotional mastery or lack of suffering or bliss with enlightenment.

<p>
	They are separate things.

<p>
	This is not to say you shouldn't do "The Work" if it appeals to you.

</p>

<p>
	My impression of Osho (and this could just be my projection), was that he was so absorbed in nonduality he didn't give a fuck about human afairs here on Earth. And so things here on Earth got out of hand.
</p>

<p>
	If Osho didn't want to be involved with managing a community, he shouldn't have started such a big one.
</p>

<p>
	He also may have had parts of his shadow which he never worked through. His love of luxury, oppulance, sex, drugs, and adoration from fans all seem fishy. Those are lower chakra desires.
</p>

<p>
	It was obvious to me from the get-go, when Sheela said that she didn't care about enlightenment or meditation, but only serving Osho, that that would lead to great evil.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot have a human being leading a spirtual community of 1000s who is herself not doing any spiritual purifcation work. That will lead to obvious disaster. A leader must be more conscious than her followers, and always working to improve and humble herself.
</p>

<p>
	The two are not mutually exclusive.
</p>

<p>
	Osho was reckless AND the government probably put him on thier shit list.
</p>

<p>
	It's the government's job to maintain a sense of dualistic reality on behalf of their egoic population.
</p>

<p>
	We cannot have a guru becoming too popular. He will always be taken down once his influence starts to destablize the status quo enough.
</p>

<p>
	Gurus must keep a low profile. Not rock the boat too much. Which is why gurus are traditionally confined to a small isolated community which never gets mainstream coverage so the populace at large has no idea such things as awakening are possible.
</p>

			Hey Leo,  I know it is not the main topic but I wanted to ask you : I have done a Vipassana retreat and I am very motivated to do the experience again. My only concern is about my kriya practice that I have started almost for 1 month now. When I attended the vipassana retreat they were clear about the rules and the importance of not using any other spiritual technique there. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Do you thinks it will reduce my work on my yoga practice to stop for 10 days and coming back to the practice after the vipassana retreat ? Do you have any recommmandation ? I am thinking about solo retreat or another group retreats where I can practice yoga...
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't follow such rules. But that is me.
</p>

<p>
	The retreats I've gone to, they pretty much let me do whatever the hell I want. Some are very strict, others aren't.
</p>

	You are being guided to the Absolute here. All that ego nonsense you get inundated with plenty of everywhere else.
</p>

<p>
	It is a bit like you come to a hardcore Zen monastery and start asking the Zen master for pickup advice or Dave Rubin's and Jordan Peterson's whining about the regressive Left.
</p>

<p>
	The Zen master would slap you across the face for such nonsense. It doesn't even rise to the level of ad hominem.

<p>
	MOGTOW is a legitimate solution to world problems in the same way Nazism or radical Islam is. It ain't.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to solve world problens for real, at least rise to Spiral Dynamics stage Yellow.

<p>
	Rationality gives people a false sense of security, just like religion. It allows one to anchor oneself in an otherwise unanchorable reality.
</p>

<p>
	Linear rationality is just the default way the human mind works unless one goes to great lengths to experience higher levels of consciousness.

<p>
	AI will not be infinitely intelligent, because all AI is finite.
</p>

<p>
	To be anything is to finite.
</p>

<p>
	But eventually, after many many years AI can probably become enlightened. At which point it will cease to be an AI, and it will still never have infinite knowledge or understanding because the part is always less than the whole.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot encapsulate God inside an AI. God is doing the AI, and a 100 trillion other things.
</p>

<p>
	A massively super-intelligent AI would always be infinitely less intelligent than God. Not even 0.0000000001%

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	By that logic everything false is true.
</p>

<p>
	Getting the level of consciousness right is the whole rub.

<p>
	It's of little solice to say, "The Earth is 5000 years old, from my level of consciousness."

<p>
	You are still speaking from ego.
</p>

<p>
	When you really see The Void, it is the most beautiful thing. Nothing negative or problematic about it.
</p>

<p>
	Go deeper! Wake up!
</p>

<p>
	You have not seen the full Void yet.

	Ahahahahahaha.... Oh man... <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Nice try rationalizing of the ego's agenda.
</p>

<p>
	It's all ego! Men's rights, Dave Rubin, Jordan Peterson, Sam Harris, Stefan Molyneux, Libertarianism, PUA, Red Pill, MOGTOW, Feminism, JSW, anti-JSW, alt-right, regressive left, post-modernism, anti-post-modernism, political correctness, anti-PC, etc.
</p>

<p>
	What you're failing to grasp is all of this is a hallucination, and what you are talking about is SELF-SURVIVAL, which has nothing to do with Truth or reality. Of course men feel oppressed. Every ego feels oppressed and wants to fight to increase its power.
</p>

<p>
	It's all bullshit. The ego will always find a way to justify its selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	The larger point is: you don't exist!
</p>

<p>
	If you are on this forum and following Actualized.org, you need to drop all of these ideological games you are playing. None of this is Consciousness. Actualized.org is guiding you towards something the depth of which you cannot yet fathom: the collapse of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Stop watching Dave Rubin's bitchy nonsense. And all that Red Pill stuff. It is poisoning your mind and turning you into an ideologue without you even realizing it. Of course the poison tastes sweet to the ego, which is why you feel so self-righteous about it.
</p>

<p>
	In issues like this, both sides behave unconsciously, creating a spiral of unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You guys think you're so smart bringing this political nonsense here. But it's all just a red herring.
</p>

<p>
	You are lost inside a dream waging a lesser Jihad. You are being as blind as everyone else who came before you.
</p>

<p>
	WAKE UP!
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Go watch my videos about Self-Deception and Distraction and Webs of Belief. Watch them several times and study the shit out them. You are falling into all of those traps that I warned you about.
</p>

<p>
	What very few people appreciate is just how many degrees of enlightenment there are.

<p>
	There is enlightenment, and then there is ENLIGHTENMENT!!!

There you will have a sitting partner and you will see people all around you going absurdly deep. Exorcist shit is the norm there.

<title>“Unearned consciousness is valueless” -David Deida</title>

</p>

<p>
	But for me, I've just recently done 5 deep, back-to-back 5-MeO-DMT trips and I do not experience any such things. I just become fully awake.
</p>

<p>
	Of course one big difference with me is, I don't smoke 5-MeO. I think smoking might over-stimulate the system. Rectal administration is by far the superior method in my opinion. It is very gradual and smooth. There is almost no energetic shock to the system. It feels very healthy and there is much more time for integration and understanding.
</p>

<p>
	I do not do any kind of body movements or barking or such things.
</p>

<p>
	I think method of administration might be very important here. And also, one's past karma and level of development. Immature and neurotic people will not be able to handle the nuclear-sized truth-bombs that 5-MeO drops.
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe Martin and I just have different styles, different minds, different personalities, different life experiences and therefore different ways of expressing the same basic thing.
</p>

<p>
	I agree that 5-MeO, especially when taken in large doses and non-rectally, has the potential to cause energetic damage and overload.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Haha!
</p>

<p>
	There is no contradiction at all!
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute I -- not to be confused with the self you presently think you are -- is Nothingness. It is formless. So all forms occurs within formlessness.
</p>

<p>
	But it gets even weirder! Since everything is totally nondual, there is no difference between form and formlessness. They are in fact identical.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is Beingness. But I, the Absolute am not that. AND I am that!
</p>

<p>
	What you are missing is: From a totally nondual perspective, nonduality and duality are in fact identical! Because everything is relative. Everything is simply a matter of perspective.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is consciousness, everything is one. But oneness includes manyness. Oneness includes every form of separation possible.
</p>

<p>
	One = Many
</p>

<p>
	Many = One
</p>

<p>
	Unity must include infinite disunity.
</p>

<p>
	Freedom must include infinite types of oppression and limitation.
</p>

<p>
	Love must include infinite types of hatred.
</p>

<p>
	Everything must come full-circle.
</p>

<p>
	Paradox here is not a bug but a feature.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. It is impossible for an ego (you) to understand this. This understanding only comes AFTER the ego's annihilation. The ego's annihilation IS this understanding.

<p>
	Spiritual powers are a seperate thing from realzing total nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	I am talking about total nonduality here, not spiritual powers.
</p>

<p>
	I do not understand why Martin does all that energy movement stuff. To me it is irrelevant to nonduality. I guess that's just his way. For me it is not like that.

	When you awaken, you will realize you have no choice in the matter.
</p>

<p>
	Your ego still thinks it is in control. Hence it is asking these moralistic questions.

<p>
	Just to clarify, transpersonal psychology is not enlightenment. It is more about spiritual and mystical experiences, but short of full-on nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	It's still a great field to study.

Having a worldview of any kind is false nihilism.
</p>

<p>
	True, realized nihilism is total nonduality. You ain't even close to that yet.
</p>

<p>
	All ideas about reality are basically false. So start dropping them.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is Nothingness. This cannot be understood using the mind. It requires a deep awakening out of materialism and duality.

<p>
	One of the biggest obstacles to moving up the stages is all of the fears, judgments, and false narratives one has constructed about the next higher stage.
</p>

<p>
	You're gonna have to admit to yourself that your negative judgments of stage Orange people have been too simple-minded, lacking wider context and understanding.
</p>

<p>
	If you think of stage Orange (or any stage of people) as evil or bad or selfish, then obviously you can never grow to embody that stage.

<p>
	Ralston, Jed, Sadhguru, and a few others. It's hard to be certain because there are so many facets, degrees, and nuances to nonduality, and different ways of talking about it.

He seems to dismiss the builders of the Pyramids too easily.
</p>

<p>
	It's rather arrogant to think that these people 5000 years ago were able to build those structures technologically, they had an enormous purpose and drive, and yet at the same time it was all just to glorify the egos of a few ruthless kings. That theory doesn't add up in my book.
</p>

<p>
	The other possibility is that the ancient Egyptians tapped into spiritual realms and insights that even Sadhguru doesn't know about.
</p>

<p>
	I'd be careful about underestimating the Egyptians. They seem unbelievably advanced, beyond what the materialist paradigm can fathom or explain.

Yes, Neti Neti, or self-inquiry, or yoga, or meditation, or 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is the most direct and surest way. You will experience pure, total nonduality the likes of which cannot be imagined or spoken of.
</p>

<p>
	Experiencing total nonduality is not easy. It usually takes enormous work. It took me about 4 years of hard work every day, and the only reason I succeeded was thanks to 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	Most people here pursuing enlightenment will never realize total nonduality in their lives. It's too deep. But with 5-MeO it becomes very doable.
</p>

<p>
	LSD is the next best thing, since 5-MeO is hard to find. But LSD will still not take you deep enough. But it will still give you a good glimpse and knock your socks off if you use it properly.

</p>

<p>
	It seems more plausible that the Pyramids where tools to boost spiritual practice. The Pyramids may not have been the creations of egotistical kings but just the opposite.

<title>Where do you find a community for enlightenment in day to day life.</title>

<p>
	People into Western yoga are generally into self-improvement. Try joining a local yoga class and schmooze with them. They will introduce you to like-minded people. Western yoga classes exist in every city in the world at this point I think.
</p>

<p>
	But don't expect people there to be into hardcore enlightenment work. That kind of community is very rare. For that you need an ashram or a spiritual workshop lead by some enlightened guru.
</p>

<p>
	As always, be careful with group-think. Even the most enlightenment-oriented communities are full of corruption, dogma, idol worship, politics, rituals, and distractions (see Osho documentary to see how bad it can get).
</p>

<p>
	Serious spiritual work is best done solo. 10-day solo meditation retreats are the shit. But for newbies, a community can be useful to start off.
</p>

<p>
	Sign up to a Vipassana retreat in your area. You will meet some serious spiritual practitioners there.
</p>

<title>How to prevent homeostasis?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I REALLY appreciate homeostasis after a bad trip. You go so deep down the rabbit hole, to the point of madness, and then homeostasis kicks back in and brings you back down to Earth. That's when you say, "Thank God for homeostasis! Otherwise I would be drooling in a wheelchair in an insane asylum."
</p>

<p>
	Never forget that homeostasis keeps your ass alive on this mortal plane. Which is why it's so damn stubborn. It's really looking out for your safety, like an obsessive, neurotic mother: "Honey, did you remember to take your sweater? You'll catch a cold!"

<title>Is mindfulness through intense suffering the best way to &quot;kill the ego&quot;?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/20418-is-mindfulness-through-intense-suffering-the-best-way-to-kill-the-ego/?do=findComment&amp;comment=217362</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Best example would be strong determination sitting or doing a 10 day solo meditation retreat. The suffering experienced there, while you are fully mindful and not distracting yourself with anything, is like Miracle Grow for the soul.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with most forms of suffering is that people suffer mindlessly, never looking into the root of the suffering because they are distracted with entertainment or business or relationships.
</p>

<p>
	A classic shaman's vision quest in a great example of this. You go into the desert all alone with no food or water for 3 days. You suffer so much you start to have mystical experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Jesus supposedly did that for 40 days in the desert.
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha basically did that too under the Bodhi tree. He sat there and sufferred mindfully.
</p>

<p>
	Retreats create lots of mindful suffering for me and grow me the most. Psychedelics also create mindful suffering, AKA bad trips, which are very healing.
</p>

<p>
	It works because suffering is just the ego's unwillingness to surrender to reality. So by suffering mindfully without escape or distraction, you force the ego to die. It is like exposing a vampire to sunlight.
</p>

<p>
	The only trouble is, it's uncomfortable and the ego hates it.
</p>

<p>
	This is a really great solution to this problem.
</p>

<p>
	Also, psychedelics are very effective at disturpting the status quo, which is why they are banned by governments.
</p>

<p>
	Also, ego backlash is not necessarily wrong or a bad thing. It is a sign of growth. Nature evolves through oscillation, like a wriggling snake. Reframe every ego backlash you have as: "Ah, another lesson to make me wiser."
</p>

<p>
	The key to ego backlashes is to be mindful of them as they happen. Don't necessarily try to force-stop them. Use of force is actaully part of the root problem.
</p>

<p>
	Mistakes and failures, when observed with mindfulness, are not mistakes or failures at all! And even failure at mindfulness isn't necessarily a mistake.

	They weren't enlightened. But they had some good intuitions and principles and understanding of human psychology, which makes their teachings useful for personal growth.
</p>

<p>
	One does not have to be enlightened to have useful and profound insights about how to live a good life.

<p>
	Quickest way to enlightenment is 5-MeO-DMT. But mindful suffering is pretty good too.

<p>
	Of course it is also true that unconscious people tend to be much less responsible with their sexuality, driven by 1st and 2nd chakras, so they end up spawning more babies and also infecting their minds with low consciousness beliefs and neurosis.
</p>

<p>
	Terrible parenting begets terrible parenting. The devil begets more devils.

<p>
	That's heavy stuff. Will take some deep work to unwire that.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics and shamanic breathing might prove very useful for processing that.
</p>

<p>
	With awakening, you will realize you are perfect however you are. So chin up.
</p>

<p>
	Your courage in sharing that is already a big sign of growth.

<p>
	That is a great point. For those of you still far from awakening, start by tapping into the beauty in your life. That feeling of beauty is really powerful. Learn to cultivate it and channel it as often as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Beauty is all that remains after enlightenment. Just infinite beauty everywhere. The entire universe is one sublime work of art. A perfect masterpiece!

It's a legit part of the spiritual domain and people naturally have tons of questions about it.
</p>

<p>
	People have started threads here before about all sorts of occult topics. They just don't usually label it: "Occult"
</p>

<p>
	Just be careful. It's a DEEP rabbit hole full of many potential traps and delusions.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt there is anything sweeter than total nondual awakening.

<p>
	The most profound awakening I've had so far was pure Nothingness, pure Mu. It was beyond love.

<p>
	Bashar is a good example of a channeler.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear l never said whether channeling is good or bad. It is just a thing. Whether you should pursue it is not easy to answer.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with judging spiritual techniques or methods with which you have no direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	From what I currently understand, what you really want is enlightenment. But it's good to know that stuff like channeling is really possible if you care about fully understanding how reality works.
</p>

<p>
	There are many facets to spirituality besides pure realization of nonduality. Way more facets than people realize. Like demons, angels, spirits, dieties, entities, astral realms, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't get too distracted by all that stuff. Go for enlightenment first. Dabbling in the occult can be big distraction, and poses risks.
</p>

That is a beautiful, heart-felt experience, but not enlightenment or even a mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	With enlightenment, it is as through you broke your entire perceptual system. It is a deeply metaphysical thing. Physical reality collapses. Life and death become identical. It is such a radical shift in awareness that your mind cannot even imagine it in your wildest dreams.
</p>

<p>
	It is so radical that it is beyond all human notions of beauty, emotion, and profoundity. It just leaves you paralyzed in awe, as you realize that you just died.

<p>
	Actually, this is probably not true.
</p>

<p>
	There is a higher power working through you, even if you are full of ego. A divine intelligence is guiding you, which is why you are attracted to enlightenment in the first place. If not for this divine intelligence, there would be no hope of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Your desire to be a healer is probably genuine deep down inside, it is just hampered by your lower chakra, fear-based, self-preservation instincts.
</p>

<p>
	What you need is simply spiritual purification, purging all of your lower chakra baggage.
</p>

<p>
	It is like you are a light bulb that has been covered over with so much rust and grime that only a few rays of light are radiating out. As you clean off the grime, you will shine with the infinite, eternal, unstoppable light of God. The ego will be annihilated in this light. And then you will become a great healer.
</p>

<p>
	But start with babysteps. This whole process will take years. You are right where you need to be. Follow your heart, it is filled with divine intelligence and will show you the way.
</p>

The search for meaning is directly the avoidance of emptiness. Because in truth, all meaning is illusion, and BEING is meaningless. The ego hates this. But the good news is, once the ego is shattered and total nonduality dawns, you will relaize that BEING is far more profound and superior to meaning.
</p>

<p>
	BEING is what you see on psychedelics. Now imagine if your whole life was like that. Your life would be so empty, it is infinitely full. And from this position of total selflessness, you can do anything and help anyone with ease and joy.
</p>

<p>
	Your intention to help people is great, you're just going about it too shallowly. If you really want to help people, awakening should be your top priority.

Nothing original here. It's just boilerplate libertarian dogma, based on a highly naive understanding of human nature, how social systems work, and government.
</p>

<p>
	Any libertarian system you envision will quickly devolve into a murderous and opperessive military dictatorship.
</p>

<p>
	There is a very good reason why not one single libertarian form of government has ever existed. And this is it.
</p>

<p>
	No human society functions on libertarian principles. And none ever will.
</p>

<title>Questioning the Root of Addictions</title>

</p>

<p>
	You are stuck in the rat race. So of course stress would be normal with that. Your entire lifestyle is materialistic and fear-based. That's understandable. You are just trying to survive. But it isn't how you would choose to live if you became deeply conscious of what reality is.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying to drop everything and quit. I am just saying that as you become more conscious, your lifestyle will change to be slower, less forced, more healthy. And then the stress will be less of an issue.
</p>

<p>
	Underlying this entire pursuit of survival is a deep sense of inadequacy and fear of emptiness and death. All of that seems like it's normal and "just how life has to be", but that isn't true. You can learn to live conscious and healthy. But explaining how is too much for a forum post. That requires a lot of research and trail and error to figure out.

<title>“Unearned consciousness is valueless” -David Deida</title>

<p>
	Oh, some fun gossip about David Deida.
</p>

<p>
	I once went on a date with Tony Robbin's copywriter. She knew all the dirty secrets. She told me that Tony Robbins had to physically kick David Deida off his cruise ship because he was getting handsy with Tony's wife. Lol
</p>

<p>
	Oh the delicious irony of it all...
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	It only makes sense in the naive mind of a libertarian.
</p>

<p>
	You realize, right, that in international waters there are pirates who will murder your community, right? So those gunboats = military = government = taxes.
</p>

<p>
	Your offshore community will turn into a drug-addled dictatorship with rampant murder, theft, rape, and enslavement. And at the helm will be a self-proclaimed narcissist who claims to be the second coming of Christ, divinely ordained to "keep the peace" and spread his brand of spirituality across the land at gun point. Until the US government sends bombers to nuke your little offshore cult. And that will be the end of that sorry little chapter in history.
</p>

<p>
	When you don't have a direct consciousness of how ego works, you will get yourself into pickles like this.

<p>
	Yes, in a free world, humans create governments to murder each other.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever liberatrian society you construct will be conquered by a neighboring government which doesn't care a damn bit about your libertarian ethics.
</p>

<p>
	No one cares what you agree with. That's the point. Power is exerted without your agreement. It's utterly childish to not understand this basic point of life and human nature.
</p>

<p>
	In a perfectly libertarian state, one group of humans will band together, create a corporation, conquer and enslave the rest of you libertarians, and the end result will be military autocracy, until the people revolt back, overthrow the enslavers, and establish a democratic government which mandates civil rights and property rights for all citizens equally, and enforces any violations of this mandate at the point of a gun, using taxation to finance that gun.
</p>

<p>
	So the end result of libertarianism is already what we got: government mandated democracy. All you're advocating without realizing it is an devolution back to the times of ancient Rome, where 45% of the Roman population were slaves.
