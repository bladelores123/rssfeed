<p>
	When you become fully conscious you'll realize brains are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Animals are also something you are hallucinating.

<p>
	It's not bad, but it will simply never work because you are assuming reality is a static objective thing when it fact the very language you use constructs reality and no two people live in the same reality.

<p>
	Yes, it's all God's imagination. But you are God, so it's your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	It's not all "ego stuff" any more than you seeing a cat walking down the street is "ego stuff". That's not ego, it's the "world".
</p>

<p>
	Some people who trip can of course do so in a dualistic way, where they might see an alien and assume that this alien is somehow "other" to them. But that alien is just like any other being in "real life". It is BOTH an entity other than you, but also it is you, since all people are you.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at the world dualistically, other people are not you.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at the world nondualistically, other people are all your own projections.
</p>

<p>
	There's really no contradiction. Both are true in a sense.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you trip with a weak spiritual foundation the ego can co-opt the trips and do a lot of egoic stuff and projecting. So you have to be careful about self-deception. Just like you do in "real life."
</p>

<p>
	But seeing a DMT entity is not ego any more than seeing a cat is.

			Then I started thinking of capitalism vs communism which has this same individual vs collective idea. (What I mean is paper communism if humans weren't so corrupt.)
		</p>

		<p>
			This duality between individual and collective seems to be a huge source of conflict between people who can't find balance between the two. Do you think this is a big part of it?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course, this is a key issue which so many people get wrong. Most people are unconsciously acting out either an individualist dogma or a collectivist dogma without realizing that these are two mutually-interdependent forces which must be carefully balanced. See video: Aztec Nonduality, where I discuss the central importance of balance.
</p>

<p>
	A big part of conscious politics is recognizing that delicate balances must be struck between capitalism & socialism, individualism vs collectivism, freedom & limitation, and status quo & progress. None of these can be taken as absolute goods. Any philosophy or ideology which takes an absolutist position on any one of these is misguided, Tier 1, and will ultimately fail. Yin and yang must be balanced. But not necessarily down the middle. Balance is a complex and dynamic process, not the mid-point between any two positions.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I also stress that difference.
</p>

<p>
	And I also stress the difference between awakening and things like cognitive development, moral development, and other developmental lines.
</p>

<p>
	You can be deeply enlightened but still deficient in cognitive development and other important things.
</p>

<p>
	Post-awakening pathologies are very common. An entire book could be written about them.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I really dislike defining "enlightenment" as total perfection. Once people get that definition in their heads, they start to expect perfection from their fave nondual teachers and then get shocked when they see their fave teacher/guru fall short of that standard because that standard is virtually impossible to meet even after 40 years of practice.
</p>

<p>
	Even when Christ was nailed to the cross he said, "Father, why have you forsaken me?" This was a very human response to a horrific situation. And I'm sure he suffered deeply.
</p>

<p>
	So to set up a standard for students that even Christ could not meet is not wise.
</p>

<p>
	And of course 5-MeO-DMT will never give anyone such an extraordinary degree of perfect equanimity permanently. Although during a 5-MeO-DMT peak, I have had that degree of perfect equanimity, where pain and pleasure are literally indistinguishable. But it will not last.

<p>
	It's not just a matter of being scared. I can do 5-MeO-DMT without being scared.

<p>
	My direct experience and wisdom says otherwise.

<p>
	One of the upsides of Bernie is that he has 40 years of government/politics experience. A lot of newer Democrats in this primary have some good ideas, but they are just inexperienced with how Washington really works. That's important to take into account. That's one of Yang's downsides for example. Same with Williamson. I worry such people might be somewhat naive about the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
	I would like so see a special law passed which seriously protects and even actively encourages whistler-blowers to come forward. It's gross how whistler-blowers are attacked for revealing deep truths. That's pure devilry.

<p>
	Of course. I don't see people confusing those two.
</p>

<p>
	Someone who has a few awakenings is not a master. But also this should not be used to disparage or deny their awakenings -- which are genuine and important, although incomplete.

<p>
	No one is claiming this either. Self-deception is always at work. Perfect clarity is not how this work works. We are doing the best we can under conditions of limited knowledge and various biases.
</p>

<p>
	The issue I have with your advancing of "enlightenment" is that you're stuck on this notion of mastery or total enlightenment as you've chosen to define it, and dismissing anything shy of it.
</p>

<p>
	Virtually no one here is going to become a master, so talking about total enlightenment is basically pointless here. It's so exceptionally rare that it is irrelevant. If someone is serious about becoming a master, they ain't on this forum, they are in a cave or forest meditating full time and they don't need any outside guidance. They understand how to do the work.

<p>
	Dude, chill. By shamanic work I was simply referring to Martin's sessions where he guided clients.
</p>

<p>
	You get really hung up on technicalities without seeing the bigger picture of the conversation.
</p>

<p>
	What Martin was doing is just a variation of shamans offering medicine. Call it what you will.
</p>

<p>
	I have read his books, I'm just not hanging on his every word as you seem to be. I read his books and quickly moved on to greater things. I am not interested in following his books as a step by step instruction manual. Precisely because I have other perspectives to consider and I saw problems with some of his methodology, including the dismissal of insight and intellectual integration of trips. I was also not interested in energetically overloading myself. I asked him about the possibility of energetic overload in an email a long time ago. He said it wasn't a problem at all. And I decided for myself that I don't believe that. It is a legit problem from my POV. And I take that into account whenever I trip and with how I suggest others trips. Because it's pretty obvious to me that disregarding energetic overload can be dangerous and reckless for other people if not for oneself. Which is why I developed the plugging method.
</p>

<p>
	I don't blindly follow people, I learn from them and adapt it to suit myself. I recommend you do the same, otherwise you might end up following someone off a cliff.

<title>Dissecting The Psychedelic Experience</title>

</p>

<p>
	I can remember some of my earliest trips as though they happened yesterday. The memories can be very vivid and even emotional, inspiring, and awakening.
</p>

<p>
	When I go over some of my deepest trips in my memory, it actually shifts my consciousness up a few notches in the now.
</p>

<p>
	Insights are also not just a matter of memory. Deep insights change your whole worldview and recontextualize life.
</p>

<p>
	I can never just forget that I am God. That understanding is with me no matter how bad I might feel.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like school. You don't need to remember all the details and facts in order for school to have significantly shaped your life. The trips reshape you even if you can't fully recall them.
</p>

<p>
	I have never claimed that 5-MeO will clear you of all defilements or produce mastery. My claim was much more humble: that it produces genuine and very deep awakening experiences which are helpful and healing.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to purify all defilements that will obviously require far more work and it is not likely to happen through psychedelic use alone, although psychedelics ARE very effective at curing certain defilements. But probably not all of them.
</p>

<p>
	To cure all defilements would require lots of daily, near minute to minute practice. It could not be a peak experience. There is value to peak experiences as well as more gradual and mundane daily work.
</p>

<p>
	All of this was quite clear from day one. I don't know why anyone would assume that 5-MeO would do all that work for you. That was never it's purpose. It is not a replacement for inner work, it is a catalyst. Which I have said from my first videos on psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with setting the wrong expectations.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not the same as moral perfection or being Christ-like. Awakening is literally just this: becoming conscious of the true nature of ultimate reality. It is not behavioral reform. If you still crave smoking, that's a separate issue.
</p>

<p>
	Many of you guys are talking about mastery, which is something that will take you a lifetime of work.
</p>

<p>
	It is foolish to equate enlightenment with mastery. And no one has ever said that Martin had mastery. This was quite obvious.
</p>

<p>
	Buddhist maps are also poor at taking into account psychedelics. The psychedelic path requires drawing new maps. Actually what psychedics reveal is the inadequecy and partiality of Buddhist maps. The Ten Ox Herding Pics do not work well for psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	That was on an early highest dosed snorted trip: 30mg. It was truamatic and felt unhealthy so I dialed my doses back a lot and invented the plugging method, which is much smoother.
</p>

<p>
	I have not felt unhealthy energetic overload from plugging about 30 moderate doses. The trips were still very strong, but smooth and healthy feeling.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It doesn't necessarily gain any ability. Any siddhis gained are an independent factor.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening alone does not clear up all energetic issues, or shadow, or ego, or emotional issues, or bad habits. Nor is it development. So there are many factors herw besides awakening.
</p>

<p>
	All of this I have stressed in the past.
</p>

<p>
	Many awakened teachers have weird personality flaws and shadow issues and pathologies.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening does not mean there cannot be a pathology. As history shows.

<p>

<p>
	To be clear, Martin's method of using 5-MeO is very different from mine.
</p>

<p>
	I don't endorse blasting oneself with 5-MeO to the point of energetic overload as that can be needlessly traumatic.
</p>

<p>
	Moderate dosing is important in my book.

Not as many as you mention above.
</p>

<p>
	Then he started being a shaman. Which is what he describes in that vid above. And yeah, I stand corrected, seems like he did a lot of it at that point as part of his shaman gig.
</p>

<p>
	So he did much more than me then in total.
</p>

<p>
	I did not realize he was smoking it in every shaman session.
</p>

<p>
	Also, taking on other people's bad energy could be very problematic if that's what his shamanism involved.

<p>
	It costs the IRS zero to know your income. You report it to them! If you report over $200k, no UBI for you the next year. If your income drops below $200k/yr a few years later, then you start getting it again. So you always have a safety net but you don't need to use it when you are kicking ass.
</p>

<p>
	The actual dollar limits aren't so important. Those can be tweaked to find a good sweet spot.
</p>

<p>
	Very profitable corporations like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Walmart should be taxed significantly more. They are getting away with robbery.
</p>

<p>
	Small biz should be taxed less. Anything under $1M should have low tax so more people are starting small businesses. In fact there should be government rewards for starting a small biz.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that people do not need more than a few mil to live extremely well. Anything beyond that is actually unhealthy for society and selfish.

<p>
	There are many different ways to do psychedelics. They don't have to burn out anything. There are gentle ways of doing them.
</p>

<p>
	And to say that psychedelics only give insights is just false and shows a lack of experience with using them.
</p>

<p>
	Martin did not even do a lot of 5-MeO. I've done more trips than him at this point.
</p>

<p>
	I was watching an interview with a guy who did 600 DMT trips. Now that's a lot of trips.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do a fair comparison, let's bring up all the cases of people who became depressed, suicidal, had insomnia, or got attacked by demons from intense meditation or yoga. 1000s of such cases are easily found.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual work is messy, period. Do not single out psychedelics here as if all other paths are a cake walk and free of problems.
</p>

<p>
	We just don't know what is going on with Martin. We need to wait and see how things go for him.
</p>

<p>
	If Martin finally concludes that psychedelics caused his insomnia, then that will be an importnat point to acknowledge and take into account. Although even in that case, it's still just one case.
</p>

	How do you pay for UBI? Easy:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Wealth tax on people with net worth over $10M
	</li>
	<li>
		Raise taxes on people with income over $1M/year

	Nay if it involves VAT taxes, cutting welfare programs, and eating into welfare benefits.
</p>

<p>
	Nay if it means no free college, no Medicare For All, no $15 minimum wage.

<p>
	Yea if it is done properly taking all the above into account.

		<p>
			Thank you for the nice responses.
		</p>

		<p>
			Leo, when are you going to invite us to your seminar? Are we going to meet you this year? Have you decided to postpone with seminars?
		</p>

		<p>
			I am so depressed lately, I do not see any reason to keep going. The more I think about the possibility of being infinite, the more depressed I become.  I wish from all my heart I meet you and other people who follow this pursuit. Sometimes, it is unbearable and feels so lonely. Would be nice to attain your convention for some "fresh air" and positive energy and offset. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I understand that my mental state is temporary, but I wish I can get out of it as soon as I can. What book would you recommend to read or what practices should I do? I want to be happy again. I used to be happy when did something meaningful or hobby, now nothing excites me anymore, even traveling.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thank you so much, 
		</p>

		<p>
			Lots of hugs.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Unfortunately happiness cannot be attained as an external condition or even an internal condition. Happiness is simply accepting whatever arises, however it is, no matter how "bad" it is.
</p>

<p>
	Meeting me will not really make you happy. I wish it were that easy.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than trying to get out of your mental state the counter-intuitive move is to just accept it, make peace with it. And that is what ends up making it okay.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, you can also act your way out of a funk. Like going outside for a jog or listening to some music. But that is not a permanent solution.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes this work is just fucking hard.
</p>

<p>
	* hug *
</p>

<p>
	I've told you how 5-MeO-DMT works. If you don't want to listen, that's your problem not mine, and I will explain no further.

</p>

<p>
	This is significant, but also keep in mind that this is just one case study, and people can be very different, especially when it comes to health issues.
</p>

<p>
	Awakened people can have health complications and even mental issues or energetic issues or shadow. Do not expect them to be impervious to stress, and under enough stress even an awakened person should be expected to crack at some point.
</p>

<p>
	Again, a lot of this confusion is caused by having overly simplistic and binary notions of awakening/liberation, where you guys think that it's total and there is zero suffering and you are a Terminator. That's a very cartoonish understanding of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	It is not clear what the cause of Martin's issues are. So don't jump to hasty conclusions.
</p>

<p>
	Let's monitor his case and see how things turn out for him and what larger lessons his situation holds, if any.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like this might be part of his spiritual path. This might be his way of purifying himself even further to reach deeper levels of self-mastery. Or it could be some rare health condition. It's hard to say.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you are not conscious then no amount of words can help you. But by chasing consciousness you cut yourself off from the very perfection which you are seeking.
</p>

<p>
	It's the classic paradox of spiritual seeking.
</p>

<p>
	How do you walk a path which has zero steps? And yet you would be a fool not to walk it.
</p>

<p>
	So in practice we must do some kind of practices.

	Locking this because I feel the examples posted here will mislead many people, since Coral is so poorly understood.
</p>

<p>
	You guys are in no position to talk about Coral.

<p>
	Focus instead on mastering the lower stages. Most of you still do not understand what Yellow and Turquoise are, let alone some hypothetical Coral.

<p>
	And that too is perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Perfection doesn't actually come from perfect embodiment but from realizing that perfection is always the case no matter how you feel or what you do. This radical level of self-love is the cure to all problems because it does not need to cure anything, it just accepts it.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive to how the ego imagines perfection. The ego's version of perfection is actually hell because it imagines a state in the future where all conditions will be favorable to it. And this will never come, causing great suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Perfection is an Absolute. It is NOW! NOW! NOW! It is EVERYTHING!
</p>

<p>
	But politics is a relative affair.

<p>
	Terrible. A vote only has value if it goes towards someone who has a decent chance of winning.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not a fan of symbolic voting. To me that's a wasted vote.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, Bernie IS an independent! He's an indepedent senator. He's merely running as a Democrat because it is practical.

	Taxing consumption is terrible because most wealth is never consumed, it sits in bank accounts, while poor people get taxed.
</p>

<p>
	We need to specifically tax wealth so it does not accumluate at the top.

Yang will reduce welfare programs to fund his UBI, then when the Republicans come back into power years later they will just end the UBI and the welfare programs would already be crippled. Thus creating big step back.
</p>

<p>
	One of the key problems with UBI is that it's so easy to end it. What's necessary is to build deep-rooted infrastructure and systems which cannot be cut easily in the future, like Medicare and Social Security.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately the UBI has no infrastructure behind it, making it weak to cutting.

	Trading stocks is a bad idea overall because you are not actually generating any value for the world. So the likelihood of failure is enormous.
</p>

<p>
	Make yourself valuable. Become a massive value provider if you wish to break free of wage slavery.

<p>
	Guys, watch the dualistic framing of your questions very carefully.
</p>

<p>
	Sloppy framing leads to poor understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Just by framing your question as me vs you, that's already wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Me = you
</p>

<p>
	By distinguishing me from you, you create my ego and your ego simultaneously. Self/other is the very first duality.

	Whatever you imagine to be real will appear real to you. And there is nothing outside you.

<p>
	You ARE experiencing my perspective! That just means you are living my life and have zero knowledge of ever having been you. Which is literally what I am. I am just you minus all your memories and experiences, plus all of my memories and experiences.

</p>

<p>
	Which is why Trump is such a terrible leader. He does not even know the meaning of that word.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie has amazing integrity. High integrity comes with consciousness. So as our society becomes better as elevating the consciousness of all citizens, we will have more high-integrity leaders (and followers).

			Great video, lot of deep stuff.
		</p>

		<p>
			The only thing I'd add is to what you said is that from my experience there comes a time in which there is no going in to find a god head (or out), there is nothing that is not god/head, the experience of those phenomenon (going in or out) and the differences that are experienced as such, visible and known (the appearance of differences, spiritual experience vs mundane everyday, more conscious vs less conscious, what is known as god vs what is just its forms and not god) are itself god/head....
		</p>

		<p>
			Another thing that I found is God tricking itself is not a negative (it may not be a trick), its not a problem, its not something to see as wrong that has happened, that "people" are deliberately" deluding themselves.  There are no people, but god happening as it wants to, living the human experience, the dog experience, the alien experience and in my opinion is to be celebrated, met with heart and love of myself.

Any take?

</blockquote>

<p>
	The whole process of awakening is full of suffering because the ego has to processes all of its own bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	But this a purification process. So it's positive in the long-run.
</p>

<p>
	No pain no gain. The devil will not leave your body peacefully or quietly. There will be moments of great self-doubt and self-loathing.

<title>Presidential candidate Andrew Yang</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/35961-presidential-candidate-andrew-yang/?do=findComment&amp;comment=443979</link>

<p>
	I am well aware of Yang.
</p>

<p>
	I watched many of his interviews and speeches.
</p>

<p>
	He is definitely very authentic, smart, and in some ways visionary.
</p>

<p>
	But I have some serious problems with his proposals:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		He uses UBI as a universal solution to too many issues. UBI is good but it cannot solve all the problems he proposes.
	</li>
	<li>
		He wants to fund UBI through VAT taxes, which is a bad idea in my opinion because it is a tax on the poor not the rich.
	</li>
	<li>
		His UBI also goes to rich people who don't need it at all and it counts against other government benefits like social security and food stamps.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is against free college for all.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is against Medicare For All.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is against $15 minimum wage.
	</li>
	<li>
		He seems to hold some libertarian notions.
	</li>
	<li>
		He does not directly question the structural problems of capitalism itself.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Yang is good, but Bernie is better. If Bernie proposed a UBI, Yang would basically have nothing left to stand on. I think Bernie should propose a UBI in addition to everything else he stands for.
</p>

<p>
	I give Yang lots of credit for proposing UBI in the first place, and for talking about job automation.
</p>

<p>
	The final problem is: he simply doesn't poll well. I don't think he has a serious chance of winning the primary. Of course that could change, but Bernie has much better odds in my estimation.
</p>

<p>
	But in the end if Yang wins, I would be happy too.
</p>

	I have warned you guys so many times about self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	Go back and re-watch my self-deception 3 part series. It's very important and you still don't appreciate how serious this problem is.
</p>

<p>
	This work is devilishly tricky.
</p>

<p>
	No, you cannot use concepts or science if you wish to understand the deepest levels of what reality is. There is no reason why you should feel entitled to that.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, I use concepts all the time to teach, but the difference is, I understand their limitation whereas you do not.

<p>
	Illusion IS reality.
</p>

<p>
	So if you think you have a past, you literally do! However you hold reality is what becomes real for you. Since you are God.
</p>

<p>
	What people don't generally understand is the constructive nature of the mind. Reality is not a given. It is constructed by you. People do not like to take responsibility for being The Creator. It is a radical degree of responsibility.

<p>
	Of course there are dangerous. Awakening is a very radical thing. We are basically talking about renouncing your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	There will be times when you will feel depressed, insane, and even suicidal. All of this comes with territory.
</p>

<p>
	And there are many more dangers. Too many to list them all.

<p>
	1) You haven't seen the full depth of it. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
	2) People need to understand how radical this work is. Otherwise they are deceived. It's important to properly communicate how it FEELS from the subjective POV of the ordinary human. To play it off cool is just dishonest. It is incredibly radical. And it is dramatic. It is not a walk in the park to realize God. So let's not pretend it is.

			Are you an unexisting bot? Are you an illusion here just for MY benefit? This, MY EGO'S benefit? Didn't think so...

</blockquote>

<p>
	Notice, the final arbiter of that is you. It is actually you who is decided if he is a bot. If solipsism is true, then you are the only thing in existence, and you call all the shots. So the only one who determines whether he is a bot or not is you. So if you tell yourself, "He isn't a bot", that's what becomes true for you.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you imagine is true, is what is true for you. Since you are God imagining the whole world. If you believe this world is real and not imagined by you, that's you imagining that you aren't imagining it, therefore making it real for you. If you stop believing this world is real, it will stop being real.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is this: because you have a dogmatic position that solipsism cannot possibly be true, you do not realize your own fully authority as the creator of reality. You have literally cut yourself off from your own authority, projecting this authority onto an imagination "other" or "world". And of course that is precisely how you create yourself as this limited human puppet. You have actually managed to convince yourself that there is an external world with physical laws which were not created by you. But the truth is, you created the whole world and then cut yourself off from the fact that you created it. And thus a human being was born. You were not born as some biological creature. You simply imagined your parents and hallucinated a life backstory for yourself. In truth, you were never born. You just tell yourself you were.
</p>

<p>
	So right now you are imagining that solipsism cannot be true and I'm full of shit. And so that is what becomes true for you.
</p>

<p>
	All of your childhood memories are things you're imagining RIGHT NOW! They only seem to have happened because you think so. And so that becomes true for you.
</p>

	Ta-da! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Those are the true mechanics of reality. There never was a physical world at all. Nor was there a human self. Nor are there other people. It is ALL YOU! All by yourself playing this twisted game of infinite imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Neat, huh?

<p>
	<span style="font-size:72px;"><strong>No!</strong></span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;">Simulation is a duality and therefore an illusion.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span style="font-size:14px;">Stop listening to materialist scientists. They are clueless about metaphysics & consciousness.</span>

<title>Solipsism is NOT true</title>

<p>
	What's true is that you are God, God is all alone, and God is imagining everything.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness cannot help being solipsistic. It is ONE! Not two.
</p>

<p>
	But of course one includes two and all the rest. So in this sense it's not the standard Wikipedia version of solipsism. It's actually way more radical and insane.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth <u>feels</u> very solipsistic. Because it is you! And there exists nothing but you.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	See my video: Balancing Theory vs Practice
</p>

<p>
	It's an important one.
</p>

<p>
	You need to get good at just taking an action when you find yourself paralyzed by indecision.
</p>

<p>
	You can take an issue which confuses and compartmentalize it, setting it aside for another day. But in the meantime you can take some kind of action.
</p>

<p>
	And also sometimes it okay to be lost & lazy. That's a normal phase of life. See my video about: Chapter & Phases Of Life

<title>Who's Interested In Conscious Politics?</title>

			A conscious politician would not identify and would be at an advantage over a semi-conscious reactive opponent, who relies on handlers and P. R. Experts to keep them out of trouble.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The problem is more tricky than that.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is this: a conscious politician would be a decent human being. By virtue of this, he/she would not be very manipulative nor stoop to dirty and unfair tactics. But an unconscious politician would not be limited in this way. He/she would manipulate to the max and act like a devil. This devilry would give him a huge advantage against the conscious person when it comes to capturing the public's attention.
</p>

<p>
	This is exactly what Trump and far right-wing people do. They have no shame because they are unconscious and absolutistic in their ignorance. And even in the rare case when a highly conscious leader manages to get elected, he is usually quickly killed or demonized to the point where his reputation is tarnished beyond repair.
</p>

<p>
	And in this way, devilry and falsehood sustains itself. It always loses in the long-run, but the short-run it can be very powerful.
</p>

<p>
	This is a profoundly deep and difficult problem. It has no easy resolution, requiring us to go through war, conflict, violence, debate, anger, etc. Which is why human history has been so violent. War is a feature, not a bug.
</p>

<p>
	Ignorance cannot help but be ignorant.
</p>

<p>
	There are many business courses and seminars which teach you the how-to.
</p>

<p>
	But mostly the how-to of business is learned by simply doing it. You make it up as you go along and follow your vision. Business requires strong vision & lots of studying your target market. You need to develop deep expertise in whatever market you're trying to enter.

<p>
	Those are your own expectations. No guru is obligated to meet your scientific standards in a lab like a rat in a maze.
</p>

<p>
	And you have no idea how many materialization have been demonstrated or repeated, because most of them would never get documented due to the very cynicism you're displaying. If you expect not to see something, you won't see it.

</p>

<p>
	Don't be so cynical. Extraordinary healing is certainly possible and materialization is within the realm of possibility. It's not so farfetched.
</p>

<p>
	And just because some people in the past have been fakes does not mean the fundamental phenomenon is bogus. Just like with enlightenment, there have been many fake people claiming the existence of God, yet God is still real. Once you realize that God is real, almost anything becomes possible.
</p>

<p>
	Be open but also grounded. It's a delicate balancing act. Notice, I did not just accept the video at face-value. To me that video is ambiguous and not definitive proof. But it is interesting.

It overcomes this problem by smoothening the trip so you can really understand what is going on, not just be blindsided and take away nothing.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to understand what the trip is doing, how consciousness functions. Otherwise it just becomes a wacky dream-like experience.

I meant, for example, someone was trying to hide his/her "deepest, darkest secret," and this person isn't telling you what it is because this person feels uncomfortable. But, you cannot help this person if you don't know. Then, all of a sudden, you got the insight in full details without this person telling you, and you're able to help this person. (Long story short.)

<p>
	You are talking about reading people's minds.
</p>

<p>
	That may be possible but that's not important. Omniscience is a much more radical thing. You can become so conscious you will understand how you invented Albert Einstein, for example. Lol. It's very radical and non-linear.

			Leo has made a few different awakening videos, saying he goes deeper and deeper. Perhaps he ends up going deeper and deeper. I will say that on the whole the concepts in all the videos feel identical. I'm just a bit confused when Leo thinks he's experienced states of consciousness beyond what is taught in conventional non-dual wisdom, I mean to me it sounds like Leo and Hinduism for example are saying the same thing. For example Alan Watts gives the analogy of the fact that everyone is a different expression of God, and that you're playing hide and seek with yourself. And the ideas of formlessness, the void being beyond all language.

<p>
	The basics of what I'm saying doesn't contradict classic nondual teachings of course. It's just a question of how deeply you realize what God is. God can understand itself at deeper and deeper levels.
</p>

<p>
	The highest truth is that you are God. But how deeply do you understand what that really entails?
</p>

<title>Who's Interested In Conscious Politics?</title>

<p>
	My point about the 2008 recession was that the banking industry and Wall Street were not properly regulated due to anti-regulation stance of the conservative/libertarian administration.
</p>

<p>
	Those industries are still not properly regulated and exploit and steal from many Americans. Wall Street is very corrupt and also corrupts all our elected leaders with their stolen and exploited money. This is not good for raising the consciousness of Americans.
</p>

<p>
	Wall Street and giant banks are allowed to be breeding grounds for devils. It's utterly corrupt and exploitative. No conscious society would allow such a thing. Most people do not fully understand how corrupt these systems are. And Trump only adds fuel to the fire by appointing these devils to his administration.
</p>

			I did. Hitting a breakthrough with N,N-DMT is significantly harder, which is why majority of people are unable to. It requires to have a good theoretical foundation and understanding of non-duality. Why? Because it is not strong enough to simply overpower the EGO, like 5-MEO can.
		</p>

		<p>
			When you vape 5-MEO, you can either surrender or resist it. If you surrender into experience(considering you have the right dosage), you will have a breakthrough, even if you lack that solid theoretical foundation of non-duality.
		</p>

		<p>
			I can confirm this not only from my own experience, but other people who I know - who couldn't get a breakthrough with N-DMT, but got it through vaping 5-MEO. The difference is day and night.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you have the option to do 5-MEO, I would advice people to just go straight to 5-MEO.

<p>
	I look forward to comparing both breakthroughs.

<p>
	There are many ways to reach Absolute Love. Psychedelics are not required. But they sure make it easy.

			Also, what do you think about the quote "Unearned consciousness is valueless" in connection to psychedelics, I heard David Deida and Ken Wilber say that, so I was questioning, also how much formal practice is necessary to make a psychedelic experience valuable or does it depend more upon theory or more ambiguous factors such as predispositions, environment, brain chemistry even, or past life experiences, karma, etc ? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I reject the notion that consciousness has to be "earned". You are God! You don't have to "earn" anything to know yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's not a magic pill. You still need to do lots of other work on yourself.

<p>
	I have not gotten deep enough into Kriya yoga to see what kind of awakening it produces.
</p>

<p>
	I trust they can be powerful awakenings. I think Kriya is very powerful.

<p>
	Of course, that is omniscience. God is all-knowing but in a far more radical way than human knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	Knowing and Being are one. God knows everything by being everything.
