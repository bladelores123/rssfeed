<p>
	Of course they should.

<p>
	It's a tricky balance. Takes lots of trail and error and experience to get it right.

			It seems, according to you, men have to be strong and independent providers to attract women. But why would you need a relationship if you are that independent, especially one in which you are like a parent? It seems you would only be in the relationship for her body. I guess that's the whole point, to not be needy and get in a relationship on your own terms.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is a more general paradox of non-attachment: those who are most needy get the least, while those who are not-needy get the most.
</p>

<p>
	For example, people who need money the most end up having the least of it. Because desperation is not a good place to earn money from. Likewise, neediness for sex or relationship is not a good place to get quality sex or relationships from.
</p>

<p>
	In general, when you are in a negotiation the one with the least attachment has the advantage. And sexual relationships are certainly a negotiation.
</p>

<p>
	You can be strong and independent but still interested in relationship and communion. It does not have to only be for her body.

<p>
	Because attracting women requires a certain realism and pragmatism. You don't get laid on fairy tales. Women will ruthlessly cull you out. Women are ruthless about this stuff despite their stories and excuses. As a man you gotta we wise to their games otherwise you will end up jerking yourself off to sleep in tears.

<p>
	The collective experience of the entire attraction community. I started out as the biggest nice guy and I went through much pain to learn not to treat women like princesses. A big part of becoming a strong and high-value man is learning how to set your own frames and not letting any girl sway you with her games.

<p>
	You are trying to logic your way about attraction and that is not how attraction actually works. Your logic flies out the window in real-life attraction scenarios.

<p>
	Because otherwise she won't respect the man. For a woman to be attracted to a man she needs to feel that the man is higher value than her.

<p>
	I did not give rigid rules. I gave general principles of attraction from the male POV. This is what men need to understand to properly get laid. If they don't understand these things, they will end up suffering.

<p>
	There are principles to attraction. I didn't invent them. Attraction works how it works.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, dating and mating is a bit of a bloodsport. It is not all rainbows and butterflies. It is survival first and foremost. There are painful lessons for the ego to learn in this game.

<p>
	Obviously, but don't use these as an excuse for your own lack of success. Do the best you can with what you have available and develop the right resources. You'll be surprised how far you can go if you really want to. You are not being creative/flexible enough. You must find the right niche for you.

<p>
	Please read the book section on Turquoise carefully before posting your examples.

<p>

<p>
	My personal rule is that there is no relationship until sex.
</p>

<p>
	But you may feel otherwise. I set my rules based on my deep experience of what works and what does not.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can try doing it the other way and get some results, but it's not a good overall dating strategy.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, that is HER frame. You can choose to play by her frame or set your own frame. Will setting your own frame lose you some girls? Sure, but it will get you many more others. As a general rule, the guy should be setting the frame, not the girl. At least from the guy's POV that makes the most sense. If you like being a pussy you can buy into her frame.

	From the moment she meets you she should realize that you are a high value guy who is highly social and desirable to many girls. She should feel that if she does not snap you up soon you will move on to other girls. She should feel like you could bang a new girl every night if you wanted to.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Attraction is highly counter-intuitive. You think that by being meek and humble and loyal and nice that this will make girls attracted to you, but it's the opposite. With that strategy you will lose many girls and mostly attract the weakest and lowest-value ones.
</p>

<p>
	A girl's fantasy is to lock down a player/knight in shining armor who is a pussy magnet. Not some meek nice guy who will beg her for sex like a panhandler begs for nickles. Regardless of whatever bullshit story she tells you, she wants a high-value guy. Period. No amount of talking or excuses will change that. And the #1 clue of a high-value guy is that he can get laid any day he wants to.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most attractive things you can do is to show up to a party with a bunch of hot girls at your side, orbiting around you like groupies. This will make you appear WAY more attractive to all the other girls, creating a feeding frenzy for your dick.
</p>

<p>
	Deep down she wants to know that you could fuck any girl in the world, but you choose to only fuck her because she is so special to you. That is her ultimate fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	If the particular girl you want is insecure, you can dial all this down a bit. But there is no shame at all for her to perceive you as sexually active. As a man, you don't need to hide the fact that you're a bit of a player. Don't explicitly say so. It should just be a vibe you give off. Girls will smell it.
</p>

<p>
	Consider Brad Pitt. Every girl knows he can fuck whoever he wants whenever he wants -- and probably does so. And this is why every girl dreams of landing him.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the most brutal truth, dating multiple women not only doesn't hurt your chances, it increases it, and the more women you date the higher your chances get. This is so true that it can get easily abused to sociopathic levels. PUAs abuse this principle all the time. I don't recommend you do that. I recommend you find a nice balance that does not crush girls hearts nor inflate your ego. You can be strong and assertive without being a total scumbag.
</p>

<title>Does dating multiple women hurt your chances?</title>

<p>
	Dude, you gotta stop asking women what they want. What men and women want is not the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that when you are pursuing women, 95% of them will flake on you and leave you dry. So from the man's POV, rather than putting up with all that bullshit, you pursue multiple women until one of them hooks hard.
</p>

<p>
	The general rule is this: don't sit around waiting for women. Do your thing until one of them falls for you and wants to go exclusive.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, unless you're doing hardcore weekly pickup, you will rarely be going on actual dates with multiple women. You wish you had that problem. That requires working the clubs harder than a rented mule.
</p>

<p>
	The general rule for guys should be this: Until there is sex, there is no exclusivity or loyalty. After sex, we can talk about it.
</p>

<p>
	If you make the mistake of being loyal to a women before she even has sex with you, you'll be in for a world of hurt. This is way too needy and attachy on your part. You are WAY too invested. The crucial mistake is thinking of her as your girlfriend before she even slept with you. Don't make that mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect any woman to okay this in some logical conversation. She won't because she has her own biased agenda at work, as do you. It is meant to be an implicit thing.
</p>

<p>
	Should you be scheduling dates behind her back once she's slept with you? I would suggest not. Once she hooks hard, you can cancel any dates you had on your schedule (should you be so lucky). She does not need to know about your schedule. If she wants to go exclusive with you, she better make that clear through her behaviors by investing a lot in your. The general principle is that you don't want to over-invest in her. Your investment in her needs to slightly less than her investment in you. If your investment in her is higher than her investment in you, you're doing it wrong. You're being too needy.
</p>

	You can't really self-actualize until you heal those issues to a significant degree.

	Yes, you are stuck in your personal selfish biases. You are not seeing or caring about the female's survival agenda, instead pushing your own.

<p>
	A woman needs a weak man as much as you need a dick in your mouth.

<p>
	There will always be people like that. Many employed people are like that too.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate solution is not just UBI, it's UBI in combination with a reformed education and social system which guides people towards finding their life purposes so they don't need to smoke weed and play video games.

<title>How to initiate kissing?</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	You have to make your dates a lot less serious. Lots of physical touching and playfulness long before any kiss. Then the kiss is easy and natural. As you are walking with her, you stop her, square up to her, get your body close to her, look in her eyes. If she holds eye contact with you, then she's ready for a kiss. You can brush her face slow with your finger, and then kiss her. And never leave the kiss for the end of the date. The kiss should be at the mid-point of the date.
</p>

<p>
	Do not kiss on check. Kiss her mouth. Make the first kiss short and without tongue to leave her wanting more. Break it off prematurely after 2 seconds, grab her hand, and continue walking as if nothing happened.
</p>

<p>
	If you treat kissing like a big deal it will feel awkward. You should treat it like nothing significant, totally natural, and always guaranteed and warranted. The rule in your mind should be: mid-point of the first date girl always owes me a kiss.
</p>

<p>
	Fake it till you make it.
</p>

<p>
	Is this really a Green problem? Or an Orange capitalism problem?
</p>

<p>
	California is progressive is some vague cultural sense, but the economy and real-estate is super Orange. Plus Covid has made life more difficult for everyone on the margins.

This forum cannot be a substitute for that. Get off your computer and go talk to an actual human about your issues. Free hotlines exist. Just google it. But after the hotline you need to find someone local face-to-face. You can find local meet-up support groups. It's important that you stop acting closed-off or stubborn and seek some face-to-face help.

<p>
	People who whine that UBI would make people lazy and not work have no idea how human motivation works.
</p>

<p>
	If UBI makes people lazy, then stock options and lavish compensations packages should make CEOs lazy.
</p>

<p>
	Why do Bill Gates, Elon Musk, and Jeff Bezos still work when they have what is effectively an infinite personal UBI?
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that these are just talking points to keep the wealth at the top.

<p>
	It's very simple, if you have zero biases, everything becomes Love.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate why torture is "evil" or "bad". Notice that it is only "bad" if you have a bias against it. If you had no bias, torture would stop being bad.
</p>

<p>
	The ego's biases distort reality so that reality can be manipulated to allow you to survive as that ego.
</p>

<p>
	For a human, eating shit is bad. For a fly, eating shit is good. The fly has a bias for eating shit because that helps it survive. The opposite for humans.
</p>

<p>
	So everything you call bad or evil is just self-bias. And all self-bias is an illusion because the self is an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	No, he speaks about it from the POV of what the guy needs to do from his side.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a guy's job to be a woman's psychotherapist and heal her wounds. This would in fact be counter-productive since you ladies always complain about being accepted for not being perfect.
</p>

<p>
	A man does not need to be guided into some deep feminine terrain, he just needs to be a man and bring out the feminine in her.

<p>
	Use your intuition to pick the best sounding one and start working on it. Make some "small bets". This is explained later in the course.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry, if you pick the wrong one, you can change it later as you realize it isn't quite right for you.

	The irony is that freedom actually is an absolute good. But it's not at all what the ego wants. If you actually got a taste of absolute freedom you would shit your pants in horror.
</p>

<p>
	God is holding absolute freedom at bay for you, treating you with kid gloves to keep you from freaking out. Or rather, you are doing it to yourself via the mechanism of fear.

<p>
	No idea. Everyone reacts differently.
</p>

<p>
	You are probably carrying around a bunch of lies, wounds, trauma, and egoic shit in your mind which the mushrooms are trying to surface.
</p>

<p>
	As you purify your mind trips should get deeper and more blissful. But there can be a long purification process. It all depends on how dirty your mind is.
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe you just have a negative physical reaction to mushrooms for some weird genetic reason. In which case you can try other psychedelics to see if they fit you better. Mushrooms are pretty squirrely.

	It's way more fucked up and twisted than you can fathom.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, your entire visual field is imaginary, including your body. Imagination IS reality. So there is no fundamental distinction between you imagining your friends, you imagining the world, or you imagining yourself. It's all imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You are thinking of it like this: "Oh, well, if my friends are imaginary, that sucks. That means they aren't real."
</p>

<p>
	But what you're not realizing is that EVERYTHING isn't real. Real is whatever you imagine hard enough. So your friends are real in the sense that you imagine they are. But as soon as you stop imagining them, they will disappear. As will your own body.
</p>

<p>
	So it all boils down to how unconscious you are of your own imagination.
</p>

<p>
	See, Leo is a fragment of your schizoid God-mind. But you don't like hearing that so you imagine Leo is real, and therefore Leo is real for you, as long as you keep denying that Leo is imaginary. So the entire game of life is imagining shit while denying that you imagined it. That's how "reality" is created. Ta-da! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	The only question is, how deep do you want to see the Truth of what you -- as God -- are doing? How deep can you stomach it? Are you willing to realize that EVERYTHING is imaginary? Or are you gonna cry uncle and play denial games? Since you are God, if you decide to play denial, there is no one in the Universe who can stop you. Only you can stop yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Do you dare become conscious that you are imagining Leo? Or... is that too unnerving?
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem is that just by telling you this I'm already spoiling your fantasy. But don't worry, you will fall back into the fantasy very quickly. Just stop listening to me.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Anger is often just a cloak for hurt.
</p>

<p>
	If you are angry a lot, you must introspect deeply to discover the hurt inside you. Who deeply hurt you and why? And you will have to acknowledge this and heal/forgive that hurt. That is the real solution here. Not hitting bags or people.
</p>

<p>
	Your anger is actually armor you created to keep yourself from feeling deep hurt. To take off that armor you will have to experience the hurt that you've been avoiding and denying. Allow yourself to feel hurt rather than posturing with anger.
</p>

	The only solution I know is:
</p>

<p>
	A) Psychedelics

<p>
	B) Very rigorous week-long retreats where you meditate nonstop using something like labeling. It will be hell and you suck it up and do it.

<p>
	Be careful. Why do you assume that you see the world from your POV? What if the world is not actually seen from your POV? After all, you as an ego are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Do you see the problem here? You assume you are real. You assume that perception is "yours". What if it isn't?

<p>
	Or just buy yourself a punching bag for home. They are pretty cheap.
</p>

<p>
	And experiment with other kinds of vigorous cardio exercises.
</p>

<p>
	You could even buy a trampoline and jump yourself dead-tired on it. It's fun too! Some cities have indoor trampoline parks where you can run around and jump like a crazy horse. Just be ware of spraining a muscle.

<p>
	My mind is wired for extreme creativity, which makes it very difficult to meditate, or concentrate on a single thing, or empty the mind. So meditation techniques are very ineffective for my brain type.
</p>

<p>
	My mind is wired such that I receive a near-constant follow of creative imagery, visions, ideas, and insights no matter what I'm doing as long as I'm not asleep. And it is almost impossible to stop this torrent of imagery. It's like a constant creative noise. This is very good for creativity but very bad for meditation.

<p>
	There is a distinct threshold that consciousness can pass at which point it "awakens". But just because you pass this threshold does not mean you cannot become even more conscious and more awake. You can become orders of magnitude more awake than that. But you at least need to cross that threshold to enter woke territory.

<p>
	These are all good questions you should contemplate and pursue your own answers to.
</p>

<p>
	From certain levels of consciousness that I have accessed it is obvious to me that most other people have not accessed it. That doesn't mean it is impossible or that only I can do it. It just means that most human brains are not suited to accessing the highest levels of consciousness in the same way that most cameras are not suited to photographing x-rays.

<title>What is the difference between Intuition and the reptilian brain?</title>

<p>
	They are quite different. Reptilian brain is gonna drive you towards very base survival needs and cravings like food, sex, safety, fear, anger, greed, laziness, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Intuition is sorta free of all that if you can get yourself clear-minded and not under craving.
</p>

<p>
	The basic distinction is fear vs love.

<p>
	This is why I generally don't like any mainstream teachings. The more mainstream they are, the shallower and more watered-down they must be.

<p>
	You have to be careful with such gross over-generalizations.

<p>
	But generally speaking progressives are more cognitively and morally developed. This does not make them anywhere close to perfect so they still make plenty of mistakes.

<p>
	It's not a matter of money. Cenk isn't doing it for the money. He's a true believer in the Green crusade and cannot envision something beyond it. It's a paradigm lock.
</p>

<p>
	And I can't say I blame him. Cenk's role is needed. Someone has to fight the fucking MAGA devils and the corrupt neoliberals. In a sense, stage Yellow thinkers are not practical because they are too far head of everyone else. Cenk is at the right level to make significant social change.

<p>
	The dirty truth is that there are thousands of states and stages of woke consciousness, way more than any model describes, and they cannot be mapped in 1 or even 2 dimensions.
</p>

<p>
	There exist states of consciousness which sit completely outside and beyond the 10 Ox pics. And virtually no human knows or understands these rare states.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is that we don't have any accurate maps or models of consciousness yet. The maps available today are like a 1st grade kid's crayon drawing of the Earth.

<p>
	The vast majority of spiritual teachers are coasting on innate spiritual talent that they were born with thanks to the right genetics and so forth. Of course they never tell their students this because it undermines the grift.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really have any problem with Tolle. I just find his teachings too weak-sauce and bland. But if you like it, doesn't bother me. There are many different styles of spiritual teaching and they will not all appeal to everyone.
</p>

<p>
	If Tolle's teachings really worked then millions of people would be enlightened. And of course that's not the case.

<p>
	But that's the whole problem. He is so immersed in fighting the progressive crusade that he would not surrender it in order to take time off to learn about radical new things. Similar problem with Jordan Peterson or Sam Harris. These people are so invested in their careers that they aren't able to reach higher because their careers would get jeopardized.

	I'd say Weinstein is definitely Yellow. He just sometimes reacts to things from a personal, wounded place. He has some shadow to integrate and some personal biases to transcend. But I consider him Yellow.

<p>
	Screws are generally okay. A screw is usually titanium.
</p>

<p>
	It's really fillings that are the problem. Although ideally you would replace your metal crowns with all-ceramic ones. But this is not high priority.

<p>
	Your motivations are backwards.
</p>

<p>
	You are asking how you can be a bigger leech. What you should be asking is how you can provide massive value to the world. That is the proper way to get rich.
</p>

<p>
	This is counter-intuitive. Your selfishness will backfire on you. It would be wiser to solve your situation through selflessness.

	I am not saying crypto is bad, I am saying your selfish mindset will keep you poor. So if you really wish to be rich, start thinking seriously about reversing your mindset before it is too late.

<p>
	Notice how you want something for nothing. This is sure way to failure. If I did business this way, I would be broke.

But on the issue of agriculture I think that will be scaled up even more, not down.
</p>

<p>
	I don't buy the idea that the Earth is running out of resources. I think the Earth can sustain 100+ billion people. We just need to use the resources wiser. There is no reason why we can't do sustainable, eco-friendly agriculture at mass scale. It's just that capitalism doesn't incentivize such things. Yet.

And the village level will never work at the global level.
</p>

<p>
	What I'm saying is, ceating one of these cool eco-villages is actually a cop out from solving the really big problems.
</p>

<p>
	The world is not going to scale down, it's going to scale up. These villages assume the world will scale down to their level. But a group of villages cannot build iPhones or manage nukes.

	Yeah, it's hard to find DMSA. That website is one of the best sources for it. Their shipping is not so great during Covid. But their DMSA is pure and excellent. You should get the 100mg pills.

<p>
	Not realistic.
</p>

<p>
	When bodybuilders add muscle, they also gain fat. Then they do special cutting phases where they shed the fat while keeping the muscle but not gaining more muscle. And usually they use steroids to do that because you would normally lose muscle too. Gaining muscle requires eating a lot.
</p>

<p>
	Eliminate refined carbs and sugars to reduce fat. And do cardio.

<p>
	Even that is not so easy to find in most places during the day.
</p>

<p>
	You are going to waste more time looking for the girl than talking to her. It is much more efficient to just to the mall for 3 hours on the weekend and do all your approaches back to back. You will also build up a nice momentum that way.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be pretty skilled to just cold-open a random girl you see walking past you as you're going about your day. Most guys will never muster the balls to seize that opportunity. They will just talk themselves out of it. It takes a lot of approaching to get confident enough to the point where you can seize such a spontaneous occurrence. It will take you 30 minutes just to psych yourself up do it unless you are experienced.
</p>

<p>
	It's much easier to talk about approaching than actually doing it.

<p>
	As someone who developed and launched many sites, I can tell you one thing for sure: no matter what kind of site you build, no matter how great it is, it will not make you any money without you bending over backwards for years to make it bring in money.
</p>

<p>
	Coding the site is the easiest part of the job. It's so easy it doesn't even deserve much worry. The real problem is how to make it popular.
</p>

<p>
	Making a site that brings in $10k/month is much more challenging than you imagine. I have achieved it in the past, but you don't even want to know the kind of manipulations and money that I had to invest to make that happen. And the internet today is way more competitive than it was 10 years ago when I did those things. And most of my sites failed entirely, bringing in zero.
</p>

<p>
	As a rule of thumb, the realities of business are 10x to 100x harder than you first imagine. That's not say you shouldn't try. Just have very sober expectations for the work involved.
</p>

<p>
	Only after I did it myself by leaving all the doctors behind. If I was listening to my conventional doctors I would be fucked.
</p>

<p>
	And still, the diagnosis I got is very limited and partial and is not sufficient to give a clear picture of the root cause or how to cure it.

<p>
	For serious detox you'd have to do 20 to 50 rounds. Depends on how toxic you are.
</p>

<p>
	I've done around 20 rounds and still feel I need to do that much more. And I never had metal filings. If you had metal filings removed you'll need to do a lot of rounds, which will takes a couple of years at least.

<p>
	Progressives are foolish. They don't understand that WV is a conservative area, not some progressive stronghold. Joe Manchin is a decent reflection of the WV populace -- which is basically how democracy works.
</p>

<p>
	Justice Dems ran a progressive to primary Manchin a few years ago. She lost badly. If Manchin goes all progressive, he would lose his next election probably to someone more right or even far-right.
</p>

<p>
	You can only expect so much from WV. They ain't exactly a forward-thinking bunch.
</p>

<p>
	If Joe Manchin was from California -- then Progressives would have a point. But notice that even the California senators are not that progressive.

<p>
	That's always their justification, but in the end their lessons are pointless because they do not scale.
</p>

<p>
	The real problems cannot be solved in some micro-community incubator. They must be solved at the Federal and global level. Scale itself is the mother problem, and a micro-community does not address that at all.

			Thank you for replying back. It was actually after watching your "something instead of nothing" video that has thrown me a bit deeper in my covid lockdown existential crisis rabbit hole. I must admit, I do not understand what you mean by "there are no bad deeds and no evil, and only love exists". How has the pursuit of truth brought you to this conclusion? I can surely think of examples that are both evil (e.g. conscious acts of betrayal, intentionally inflicting pain) and love (selfless sacrifice). 
		</p>

		<p>
			Do you clarify this in depth in one of your videos because I do not understand the logical path you are following to come to this conclusion. I do not "enjoy" suffering, but my mind leads me to both pain and bliss when I am in the heights of my mania. <br />
			<br />
			Perhaps if I understood your reasoning here, I could make more sense of this when I am lost. Essentially, why is good and love infinite and absolute, but hatred and evil not?

<p>
	The problem is that none of these eco-villages will scale.
</p>

<p>
	Our problems are too scaled to be solved with rich, well-educated, elitist eco-villages.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically, an eco-village is the opposite of holistic, it is very exclusive and niche.

<title>The stupidity of being against nuclear power</title>

<p>
	I think solar and wind is now cheaper than nuclear, especially if you factor in the costs of rigorous nuclear waste storage costs.
</p>

<p>
	Old nuclear plants did not factor in such costs, creating a gross long-term externality.
</p>

<p>
	But if someone invents solutions to these problems I would be for it. It makes no sense to be ideological about energy. We want the cheapest, cleanest solution long-term, whatever that is. But it has to factor in externalities.

</p>

<p>
	As the intensity increases it becomes more self-aware as it folds back in on itself.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	You misunderstand. There are no bad deeds, no evil. Only Good and Love exists. Nothing else.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to realize that so you cease being lost in delusions which create suffering.
</p>

<p>
	If you enjoy suffering, by all means don't pursue Truth or Love, stay lost in your delusions. Most people go this road.
</p>

<p>
	Since Good and Love are infinite and absolute, they cannot have any point outside themselves. It is stupidity to seek a point outside of the thing itself. The key is to recognize this and ground yourself in the thing itself.

	For example, you can visualize yourself being persistent with applying for jobs and ultimately landing a good job. There is nothing unrealistic about that.

	Perhaps, but the question is a holistic one which touches on many more factors than a few bombings.
</p>

<p>
	Biden is gonna have to bomb half the Middle East in order to overtake the sum total of Trump's collective evilness.

<p>
	That's cause you are putting out shitty energy and/or not talking to enough women.
</p>

<p>
	If you are approaching 1 girl per day you will never feel abundance and you will be forced to settle with the bottom of the barrel.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of pickup is that it teaches you how to put out better energy. It's not only about numbers. You become much more charming. But for that to happen you gotta be serious about it and hit the streets hard.
</p>

<p>
	When you go out you should aim to approach 5-10 girls at least per day/night. And you should go out at least 3 nights a week.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that real estate prices should naturally rise if the global or city population is rising. Land is a limited resource. And desirable land is even more limited.
</p>

<p>
	The world population doubled in the last 50 years. So of course prices go higher.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously there is manipulation and capitalism at work on top of that.

<p>
	You have to consider US debt in relation to the size of the US economy.
</p>

<p>
	And you have to take into account what would happen to the economy if no stimulus was made.
</p>

<p>
	It's all counter-intuitive and not so easy to unravel.

	That's your whole problem.

<p>
	You need to break that limiting belief to pieces.

<p>
	Not a good plan. It's far too inefficient.
</p>

<p>
	Better to spend 3 hours on the weekend to approach 10 girls in a row.
</p>

<p>
	Learning these skills requires building momentum. Your first approach is going to bomb most of the time, especially as a noob. You can't learn effectively that way. It's like saying, "I'm going to lift one weight, once per day, for 2 years."

	You don't want a breakthrough on your first trip. Go with 1/4th square as he said.
</p>

<p>
	You can always trip more later.
</p>

<p>
	300ug is A LOT. It can mindfuck you real hard. 150ug is a solid trip that will mindfuck most people.
</p>

<p>
	A breakthrough is a very serious thing. You don't need one right away. Slowly build up to it. Sub-breakthrough trips are still highly beneficial.

<p>
	Don't screw around, use DMSA + ALA if you want to detox properly.

<title>Seafood healthy or toxic critters? 🍤</title>

<p>
	If you consume seafood, take 3 pills of activated charcoal with your meal to soak up the metals. Not a perfect solution but better than nothing.

<title>How to deal with feeling sad and sorry for other people?</title>

Embrace the sadness. The ignorance of others is something you need to embrace as part of yourself and the existential tragedy of reality.
</p>

<p>
	This sadness has deep spiritual significance. You, as God, must realize that even God cannot save a devil who refuses your help. And to love that devil in the face of that is the highest Love!
</p>

<p>
	You haven't mastered Love until you've learned to love ignorance in all its many and ugly forms.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Maybe it is for you, I don't know. You'd have to get to the rock bottom of it.
</p>

<p>
	Creativity is a very broad thing. I highly doubt you're gifted at all forms of it.
</p>

<p>
	Vague generalities are not your friend here. Force yourself to get specific and precise. You can loosen up later once you have something real solid.

<p>
	Maybe it could, if you wanted to study and teach creativity as meta thing. But other than that you should hone it down some more.
</p>

<p>
	In what unique way do you want to be creative? << That's what you should be racking your mind over.

Same with investing.

<p>
	Not that I'm a huge fan of landlording, but most rentals have market rates. You could price your rental reasonably or even slightly below market and still earn money.

			I thank you for your kind and uplifting words. However, it's not just the lack of jobs available that's been the issue for me.

	Dude, you are applying for largely unskilled labor. You don't need to compete hard to get those jobs. Nothing is preventing you from landing such a job. This isn't rocket science.

<p>

	Real estate does not have to be unethical.
</p>

<p>
	I recently bought a house. I don't see anything unethical about that.
</p>

<p>
	You can also invest somewhat ethically in certain stocks.

			1. Raising your career capital by first creating relatively low consciousness small scale projects (addictive / catchy / appeal to basic human instincts). Yet not harmful.
		</p>

		<p>
			2. Using the gained capital to create higher consciousness products that bring more value to the world but require a bigger budget.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	There is not necessarily such a correlation between high consciousness products and bigger budgets. Not sure why you link these two things. Many low consciousness things require huge budgets, and vice versa.

<p>
	That is a very common thing in spiritual circles. They will gaslight you to stop thinking or asking questions.

<p>
	Of course getting lost in theory is also a common trap. Traps everywhere.

<p>

<title>Question about a man's responsibility in sex</title>

<p>
	Sounds like she is just stressed or doesn't have her life together.
</p>

<p>
	In this case it is your responsibility to decide whether she is right for you and to communicate your needs and expectations to her.
</p>

<p>
	If her life is so chaotic that she cannot make time or be in the mood for sex on a regular basis, then that's really her problem and your job is to find a girl who is at your level.
</p>

<p>
	To be creative, pick a small project and work on it.
</p>

<p>
	Anxiety will arise. Deal with it. That's part of the work. As you immerse yourself in the creative work the anxiety will subside.
</p>

<p>
	The hardest part is getting started.
</p>

<p>
	Those drone strikes were in stead of a trillion dollar war that cost 100,000+ lives.
</p>

<p>
	Your thinking on these issues is childish. You have no idea the seriousness of geopolitics and what is required to maintain order.
</p>

<p>
	Drones hardly even existed in the Bush era. It's like saying Hitler was a good guy for not using lasers.

<p>
	Anxiety and fear are not resourceful states to create from or make good strategy from.
</p>

<p>
	Try to calm yourself down, ground yourself, and then get creative. 19 is very young so you got plenty of room to work with. Don't be lazy, but also let go of the anxiety and paranoia.
</p>

<p>
	Rarely can you just jump into the LP immediately. It usually takes some years of planning and maneuvering.

<p>
	Of course it's normal. You're just a baby and you're just starting to learn how deceptive and illusory reality is.
</p>

<p>
	Existential crises are an acquired taste.
</p>

<p>
	Try to enjoy the process of inquiring into reality. It's not supposed to be a negative thing. Reality is a wondrous thing to contemplate and explore. Frame it as exploration. When I was your age I was doing philosophy and I loved it. Stop trying to reach some ultimate destination and enjoy the journey. This shouldn't be too hard since you're an INTP so you should love this stuff.

	I did anesthesia last year. It feels exactly like falling asleep. Nothing special about it at all. You fall asleep within seconds and wake up as if nothing happened.
</p>

<p>
	I woke up feeling very well-rested, even though I was only under for 30 minutes. It felt more like I slept for 8 hours.

<p>
	That's because the pundits get paid for writing articles, not for predicting markets.
</p>

<p>
	Market prediction advice is the oldest grift on Wall Street. Don't fall for it. None of the "experts" know how to predict the market. Which is why they charge commission or sell you their advice instead.

<p>
	You are still floating in Nothingness right now.
</p>

<p>
	But, you can also have "blank" experiences of Nothing. It feels very similar to what you might imagine the universe was like before the Big Bang.
</p>

<p>
	Have you never died in your dreams and experienced just being a conscious void for a while? That is it.

<p>
	Be careful with pundits making any kind of market predictions. They have a history of being very wrong.
</p>

<p>
	I remember back in 2010 there were pundits talking about how the US economy was going to go into a huge double-dip recession, so sell everything and buy gold. And then there was a 10 year bull run.
</p>

<p>
	These pundits don't know shit. They make their money selling you their punditry. If they really knew what the market was going to do they would be quietly playing the market, not loudly playing you.

	If you're going to pursue dating advice, try to do it without so much blind selfishness and self-bias in your thinking. Stop with the gender wars.

<p>
	Ashrams are more common. Especially in India. But you can find ashrams in other places too.

It should work in theory since the heavy metals should sink to the very bottom of the container as long as you don't shake or stir it.

	You don't need to remember the details.
</p>

<p>
	Underline every book as you read it, then you can quickly re-read a book within 20 mins just by reading the underlined parts -- if you need to refresh your memory. Underlining is crucial and it takes way less time than taking notes.

God-realization is much more intimate. It doesn't feel like becoming someone else, it feels like becoming fully, truly YOU. The Infinite You. It feels great. But it does take some getting used to.
