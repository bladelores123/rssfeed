It's not simply greed. The people who work at these companies actually care about stuff -- they are not robots or zombies. The days of those kinds of corporations that only cared about profits are coming to an end.

<p>
	We are nowhere close to a slippery slope.
</p>

<p>
	Denying the results of a certified US Presidential Election is kinda a big deal if you care about maintaining democracy. These are not just some right-wing political videos. These are videos denying a Presidential Election that was not even close.
</p>

<p>
	The fact that we are even having a slippery slope debate about this is absurd and a victory for the devils on the right.
</p>

<p>
	Biden won. If you can't deal with it, don't expect the entire world to bend over backwards for you.

<p>
	If Big Tech called right-wing ideology a lie, the right wing would still be here crying and whining about how unfair and biased it is.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of policing is that it's not enough to call a thief a thief, you have to ban him too. There must be consequences when people try to spread lies for profit and power.
</p>

<p>
	It's like, people understand the function of policing in the material world, but in the online work they think that policing doesn't need to happen and things will just magically go well. No. If you don't police online spaces criminals will take them over. Bad actors are always looking for entry points.

</p>

<p>
	It is ironic that those who cry about 1984 are in fact using 1984 to denounce YT for calling a lie and lie. Hence those who call YT "censorship" are in fact using the Newspeak and Doublethink of 1984.
</p>

<p>
	"Freedom of speech" is in fact Doublethink, invented by the devil so that that devil is free to keep spreading his lies. And any time someone calls out the devil's lies, he pulls out the Free Speech card. Classic gaslighting.

<p>
	You will never have total freedom to spread bullshit and lies without consequence in a healthy society.
</p>

<p>
	Censorship is when truthful things are banned by powerful people because it threatens their power. What YT did is not censorship, it's the policing of devilry. It's the same thing as contemporary Germany banning Nazi symbols and propaganda.
</p>

<p>
	A platform the size of YT will always have moderation and rules against misinformation.
</p>

<p>
	If the left wing starts to spread misinformation to the same degree and with the same reckless shamelessness as the right wing, then they too should be banned.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is the false equivalence drawn by right-wingers between right and left. They are not two equal but opposite sides. The right-wing lies much more and so they rightly get slapped more for it.
</p>

<p>
	If the right-wing cared about truthfulness even a bit, most of these "censorship" problems would disappear. But of course a liar does not like when his lies get called out or fact-checked.
</p>

			<strong>2)</strong> How can imaginary also be so tangible?
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Example:</strong> The ferocious dog is imaginary, and then I touch the imaginary dog, and it bites me. I have a deep wound on my leg. My leg is also imaginary. I feel the pain, though. There are tears - imaginary, as well.
		</p>

		<p>
			They feel like distinct episodes. How can I put it all into one coherent idea of imagination? Is it even possible to be that aware in everyday life? 
		</p>

		<p>
			I am not going to sit there laughing, right? - "Look, hahaha, an imaginary dog bit me and there's this random liquid oozing out of my body, but this liquid, color and the body is imaginary, and this sensation, which feels so real is also imaginary - fantastic."
		</p>

		<p>
			Well right now, my mind is, uh, to put it in the most eloquent sense - majestically fucked.
		</p>

		<p>
			I appreciate your insights.

<p>
	Since imagination is infinite, nothing can exist outside it, and there is nothing else you can contrast it with, so it becomes reality. Imagination is Absolute. "It's so tangible" is just one aspect of imagination. It can be tangible or intangible or an infinite number of other things.
</p>

<title>Age difference in a relationships</title>

<p>
	There's no problem per se with a 25 year old girl dating a 40 year old, because she's mature enough to be responsible for herself. So it's not the age difference that's the main problem here. The problem is that a girl who's 18-22 is immature as hell and doesn't know what she's doing.

<p>
	So what?
</p>

<p>
	You have to distinguish between the reasons for how that comes about. Girls have lots of one night stands simply from being highly social and because they get pumped and dumped by guys.

<title>Does Human Existence = Human Expression?</title>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are misunderstanding enlightenment. It doesn't eliminate emotions, it allows you to feel them stronger and deeper, and appreciate them more.
</p>

<p>
	Unenlightened people express themselves in neurotic and dysfunctional ways because they are run unconsciously by based emotions related to fear.
</p>

<p>
	Conscious people express themselves more authentically, functionally, and creatively in alignment with Truth & Love.
</p>

<p>
	Creative expression is going to happen regardless because that's not a human quality, that's God's very nature. God is infinite creative expression. The closer you get to God, the more creative and powerful your expression will be.
</p>

<p>
	You should distinguish low consciousness emotions centered around fear and falsehood vs high consciousness emotions centered around Love & Truth.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not talking about incels or virgins or even number of sexual partners.
</p>

<p>
	It may very well be that women have more sexual partners on average than men.
</p>

<p>
	But women still don't employ a pump and dump strategy while men do.
</p>

<p>
	In general, since women socialize more they have sex more. If a guy socialized as much as the average girl, he'd get laid a lot more.

<p>
	Not as much as men.

<p>
	Most women are not looking for casual encounters.

<p>
	Occasionally girls are out to have fun and purely get a one night stand, but this is an exception not the norm. Girl cannot afford to be perceived as a slut. It hurts her survival value too much.

<p>
	The reason men are content with less is because they will pump and dumb. When you pump and dump you could sleep with a hippo and be okay.
</p>

<p>
	Men are actually NOT content with less, they're just always angling for more.
</p>

<p>
	Since women don't employ the pump and dumb strategy nearly as much, of course they will be choosier.

<p>
	The problem is the extreme power imbalance which will lead to him abusing/exploiting her unless he is a saint. Which of course he is not because he's already playing devilish games with hiding his age. Only a devil would want to date a 19 year old to begin with. So obviously he's gonna exploit her and she's too young and dumb to understand that.
</p>

<p>
	Which is exactly why her parents would (correctly) freak out if they found out. You might as well tell them that their daughter is hanging out at the Playboy Mansion.
</p>

<p>
	Men will go to great lengths to scheme to get young girls.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing good will come of this. You might want to tell her parents because this dude could seriously traumatize her for a long time. Best case scenario he will just exploit her for sex and break her heart. Worse case scenario he will manipulate her so bad that she'll be in therapy for the rest of her life.
</p>

<p>
	There is no happy fairy-tale ending here. He will exploit her. You better act fast before she falls in love with him.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of dating a 19 year old is that he gets to exploit her. Like a cat playing with a mouse. It's obvious to anyone with some sense what this guy is doing.
</p>

<p>
	I am not interested in collaborations. I have my own work. Wilber has his own work. There is no need for us to collaborate.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like doing things which have no purpose of being done. I have enough work cut out for me for the next 20 years. Everything else for me is a distraction from that. My work is not going to get much better all the sudden from collaborating with someone. It will actually get worse. My work is not of the type that is done by a group of people. I'm not in the business of engineering rocket ships here. I am an intellectual and intellectuals do their best work solo. If I wanted to work in a group I would be making video games.

Then again, a college degree might be helpful here so why not get it if it's gonna help your work?
</p>

<p>
	The concern should not be about college, but about whatever is necessary to get good at your job. If that means college, then college it is. If that means some other way, then that's the way.
</p>

<p>
	There are so many different possible positions within the field of counseling people that you've got tons of different options.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you can become a hypnotherapist. This requires no college degree. A master in hypnosis can help many people.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking inside the box. There are at least 100 different ways you could carve out a niche for yourself in this field.
</p>

<p>
	And don't be afraid of college. You can find great psychology programs if you bother to look.

<p>
	You totally misinterperated what he said.
</p>

<p>
	He said, "The <u><strong>utility</strong></u> of your career (relative to family), maybe that peaks by the time you're 35 or 40 and then it starts to decline pretty rapidly".
</p>

<p>
	He was not talking about your career declining at all. He was talking about the relative <strong><u>utility</u></strong> (significance) of family, love, and children.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of older people have great careers that are peaking. That's not the issue. The issue is, will that career truly satisfy you?
</p>

<p>
	He was basically making the point that being a workaholic is not a good strategy for happiness. Which of course is true.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, having a bunch of kids is also not a good strategy for happiness. Most miserable people in the world probably have kids. JP has kids. Is he happy? Nope.
</p>

<p>
	Happiness is not a function of material conditions. And kids are a material condition.

	BTW, even though I said above that I have a policy of not engaging with reactionaries, I will still always be open to constructive feedback. I rarely get good constructive feedback, usually it's trolling type stuff which I ignore. But if I see genuine constructive feedback I will read it and take it into consideration since I do make mistakes and my ways of teaching can be improved.

<p>
	I have no interest in tearing him down. I am happy if he is doing his creative work and helping to popularize and educate about psychedelics. There is value in that and I want to morally support my fellow psychonaut pioneers. We psychonauts should not be fighting each other. We just need to recognize that we will have differences of perspective about psychedelics in the same way that spiritual teachers have differences in perspective about God.

<p>
	The thing is this: if Adeptus and I had a public talk to hash all this out, in the end all that would happen is that we would be talking past each other because we have relativistically different POV. These relativistic differences would not be resolved, and even if they were -- in the best case scenario -- all that would be revealed is a series of mutual misunderstandings. Nothing of substance would be revealed or learned.
</p>

<p>
	This is the nature of all debates and public feuds. They are debates about nothing. Just differences in perspective based upon difference in consciousness, experience, and various biases.
</p>

<p>
	So this kind of "spinning of wheels" is the kind of thing I wish to avoid with my creative energies. I see it all over YouTube and I have never seen anything that I value come out of it.

<p>
	This is not something that happens in any YouTuber interaction.

<p>
	I've had some of those conversations in private. But again, it requires a very special person and a very special situation.

<p>
	Generally though, you will NEVER discover the truth via a conversation with someone else. All conversation is a distraction from spiritual practice. Which is why your ego craves it so much.

			Leo, you stated you would be interested in a public discussion and I (perhaps incorrectly, but I'm sure I am not alone here) interpreted that as you offering to have an on camera conversation - after all, our primary method of public broadcast is YouTube and that is where our collective audience is. That you expect me to engage with this forum rather than our common platform, and that you have ignored all my previous communications since your initial offer, makes the offer itself appear insincere and more like an attempt at damage control.

<p>
	There is really no damage to control. I just needed to make clear that what Connor is doing has little to do with my teachings.

			1. You are absolutely NOT responsible for Connor, but you are responsible for YOUR treatment of Connor - clearly you agree at least to some level, because you have stopped calling him an unhinged lunatic and started treating him like a human being. So NO, you are not expected to "support" Connor Murphy, but you are expected to not be a total arse to him just because he is parroting you. 
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	The reason I reached out to him is: 1) Because I don't want him to hurt himself, and 2) Because I don't want him to give spirituality and psychedelics and Actualized.org a bad image. Yes, your video spurred me into taking these possibilities more seriously because in general I don't take people like Connor seriously unless I'm really forced to. I don't sit around watching people's spiritual videos. My attention is focused on my own work. When some posts a video mentioning me or criticizing me, I have zero interest in seeing it. My initial reaction is that it's a distraction. Any errors in my work will not be revealed to me by some YouTube reactionary, they will be found by myself. I don't need you to tell me where I'm deluded, I will find all those areas much deeper myself.
</p>

<p>
	I still hold to my initial statements:
</p>

<p>
	1) Connor is acting like an unhinged lunatic in the way he style his videos. Any casual observer with perceive him to be unhinged, regardless of whether this is true or not. I wanted to speak to Connor to find out if he's actually unhinged in person. My conversation with him was healthy and reasonable. I wish he came off that way in his videos so people don't get the wrong idea. But he told me he deliberately plays up the crazy for purpose of views and clicks. To me that's a waste of my time. This entire "controversy" is basically nothing but clickbait drama. Which is why I don't usually respond to such things. It's a distraction from serious spiritual work. I generally don't like it when people create controversy and drama just for attention because this seriously distracts my audience from the deep work they should be focused on doing. I am protective of my audience's attention. I don't want it directed towards dramatic stuff like Connor's Tantric sex. It's a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
	2) I still hold that Connor is a Zen devil. I have an old video: Becoming A Zen Devil, where I explain many of the traps Connor is falling into.
</p>

<p>
	My treatment of Connor was fine considering that I try to keep my focus on my own work and not the work of others. When a guy comes off as unhinged I don't give that person much of my attention. That's what happened. Then your video made me rethink the situation and get involved. I generally don't like getting involved in such things because it's usually not constructive or productive.

<p>
	No, he is not saying the same things I am saying. Not at all. I have never engaged in clickbait with my channel. I do the opposite of clickbait and it costs me millions of views and $$$. So to compare my teachings with Connor is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	Just because Connor says basic spiritual truths such as "I am God" or "Life is a dream" or "Do psychedelics" does not mean his teachings are the same as mine. Those a common spiritual truths which many spiritual teachers say. What matters is the other 95% of the teaching.

			3. I fully appreciate that going through a process on camera is messy, and when framed as a subjective stream of thought then I have zero complaint with that. My issue is that doing so WITHOUT that proper framing is irresponsible, and both you and Connor are making the same mistakes here. Sure we all say strange things as we go through our process, but your "I'm leaving video" makes many statements framed as objective fact - and not to state the obvious, but you made this video BEFORE your 30 days of 5MEO. So NO you weren't recovering from 30 days of 5MEO breakthrough... unless of course we are adding time travel to your list of abilities?

	Addiction is your assumption. I never said anything about addiction. It was a spiritual experience, and an amazing one that you only wish you had.

One can only assume that on some level you agree, because you did a 180, stopped making derogatory comments about Connor, reached out to him, and now everyone seems happier for it. This is the beauty of peeking outside of the echo chamber once in while, because sometimes the position you have needs to be challenged. Now that job is done I can ride my white horse home.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Calling Connor a Zen devil was a precise articulation of his problem. My comments were derogatory in the same way that anyone new watching some of Connor's unhinged videos would react. BTW, I withheld commenting or judging Connor for many months. People have been posting his videos here since last spring and I withheld judgment even though in the back of my mind I already saw that this guy was a troublemaker and a potential distraction. I only called him an unhinged lunatic after enough of his videos were posted here and your video linking him to me was the straw that broke the camel's back.
</p>

<p>
	I toned down my language so that I could reach out to Connor and find some common ground to try to persuade him not to go down the road of Zen devilry. If he continues making unhinged clickbait videos, my initial opinions of him will stand. I want to give him some space to correct himself.

My criticism simply revolves around the abilities you claim can be unlocked by having had the God awakening - an awakening which according to YOU, you have gone through multiple times. My argument is simply that such abilities are completely delusional bullshit, along with the various ego inflations which seem to accompany it.

	Such abilities are not delusional bullshit. But these abilities require serious spiritual practice to actualize. A psychedelic trip alone will not grant these abilities in the sober state. This is still something I'm researching and figuring out.

			I don't want to go through the entire video blow by blow, but here is one of your direct quotes to accurately highlight my position, and how your statements are being framed as objective fact rather than fluffy poetic subjective interpretations (see point 3 above)
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong><em>"I can help you to discover that you are God. When you do realize that you are God, this will instantaneously solve every single problem in your life, not only that but it will heal you, it will heal you of every disease and problem that you have"</em></strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			 ...apart from porn addiction, chronic fatigue, digestion problems, and textbook narcissism I guess?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That particular statement was overstated, to be fair to you. And I can see why that would arouse skepticism in people like you.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless, deep consciousness can indeed resolve and heal many problems in your life. It's not a magic cure for everything. Some problems need to be fixed at the material level. So I will concede that point to you. I exaggerated with that statement. I do have tendency to exaggerate and overstate things sometimes in order to communicate the depth and profundity of these remarkable states of super-human consciousness. Sober words don't really do these states justice.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is that everything that I said about spirituality, consciousness, and psychedelics is a gross understatement. I have accessed states of consciousness which are absolutely beyond anything that could be explained or taught, or that has been accessed by traditional teachers. Doubt me if you like, but I don't care. In these states of consciousness literally every problem is resolved. The problem is how to sustain such consciousness. That's the only real problem.

			Now as for all the various claims about psychic powers, nonduality, what all this means - that's something we could get into if you ever want to ACTUALLY ENGAGE with me, but I'm not going to spend any more time on this forum than need be. I signed up purely for the reason to take you up on your offer for a public conversation, but if that offer is no longer there or that I misconstrued it then this account is of no use to me. Forum based back and forths are often petty and unproductive, and I think you of all people know this, so why you would suggest it as an appropriate medium for a discussion like this is baffling - again it just reeks of the insincerity of the original offer.
		</p>

		<p>
			My offer for a conversation is still there, and as I think this whole debacle has perfectly highlighted - sometimes its good to be challenged. That challenge works both ways, and make no mistake about it Leo - you could certainly challenge me, and I think we could have a fascinating conversation. Despite how you might read my admittedly snarky and blunt comments, I have said many times that I greatly respect what you have achieved here with Actualized, and that you have done some superb work with great insights. I sincerely tip my hat towards you and encourage you to stick your head above the trench-line, because the greater conversation around psychedelics and consciousness will happen anyway - just without you. This is somewhat tragic because I think you have valuable contributions to make to the discourse that is happening OUTSIDE of Actualized, if you could just pull your head out of your own arse and be prepared to accept a few bruises to your ego.

<p>
	I get very little out of engaging with you. It takes up time which I could invest in creating better videos.
</p>

<p>
	I have a general policy not to engage with any reactionary material to my work. Now, of course, my critics will chalk that up to the fact that my positions are too weak to be defended in public debate. But the reality is that the things I teach cannot be debated at all. So I don't debate and I don't react. I don't really do interviews either. Because I want all my attention to be focused on constructive work.
</p>

<p>
	My policy has always been not to engage reactionaries. I made a rare exception for your video because Connor has a large audience and I don't want them to get misled about this work, and also because I became somewhat concerned about Connor's psychological health. Your video did make me take this issue more seriously, as I initially dismissed the seriousness of the situation. Because my mind is not focused on anyone's work but my own. So some thanks to you for that. If a see some crazy YouTuber doing something, I generally have no interest in butting in. I got my own work to focus on.
</p>

<p>
	This whole incident, thanks your video, has made me even more convinced that in the future I will not be responding to any reactionary YouTube content about me. And that is because nothing of value comes from it. I will not do debates and I will not defend any of my teachings. My teachings will stand completely on their own merits. My teachings are true only if you can validate them for yourself. Anything that comes out of my mouth which you cannot validate is not true. Which makes things very simple. My teachings are not an ideology of any kind and therefore they require no defending or debate. You cannot discover the truth of my teachings via a conversation, discussion, or debate. You cannot know whether miraculous healing is possible from super-human states of consciousness via discussion on YouTube. The only way to solve that is to actually do it.
</p>

<p>
	I thank you for your willingness to engage in a public conversation, but I would rather focus my time and energy towards creating positive new content rather than distracting my audience with drama, gossip, and controversy.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that I'm saying you're wrong, either. Even if you are right, I will let the audience make that determination for themselves while I move on with doing my constructive work. But I simply have no interest in publicly adjudicating rightness or wrongness. A much faster way to adjudicate that is through actual practice. Practice is what will cut out all the falsehood. If you are right and I am wrong, practice will show that. So I would rather just direct my audience to practice more.

I actually spoke with Tom just last night, and he's a great guy - very down to earth, and open to different perspectives. Yes we talked about you and, with some obvious caveats, we both reiterated that we appreciate your work. Maybe its time to leave the Howard Hughes persona behind, rejoin the conversation, and clean up the bottles of stagnant piss?

<p>
	I simply have zero interest in explaining myself to YouTube reactionaries. I would rather just focus on making videos that actually help people do spiritual work.

			One final point I would like to address is more to your fans who seem entirely obsessed with the notion that "I am here to cash in by milking the Leo cow". I find comments like this about views and subs to be extremely lame, but since I am already here and we are having a reality check then lets roll with this.
		</p>

		<p>
			Out of 102 videos I have made then 3 are about Leo (its really more like 2.5 since this last one is more about Connor Murphy, but lets round it up to 3). None of those 3 are anywhere close to my best performing videos - so NO, Leo is not a cash cow. My best performing videos are all related to substances (DMT, 5MEO, Amanita), so if we must use such crude analogies then SUBSTANCES are the cash cow by ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Okay, good for you. In general I have a very low opinion of YouTubers who make their careers as reactionaries. If that's not you, then great. I wish you a long and happy career as a constructive content creator rather than a troll.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe at some point in the future we could have a public conservation, but right now my focus is on deepening my own practice. I'm not even much interested lately in being a YouTuber. Very soon most of my focus will be going into my own radical awakening and spiritual practice. When I do my deepest work you will not even know that I exist.

	Only use 3 labels: see, hear, feel.
</p>

<p>
	Everything will fall under those labels.
</p>

<p>
	Smell and taste will just fall under feel.
</p>

<p>
	Do not invent anything new. This is not an exercise in creativity or thinking. The point is that it forces your mind to focus and be mindful.

<p>
	Like I said before, from the absolute perspective all criticism of reality is delusion. In a sense, any time you criticize anyone you are being delusional.

<p>
	This is a self-improvement forum.
</p>

<p>
	The idea is to, like, improve yourself, rather than making up excuses for why you can't.
</p>

<p>
	Change yourself so girls want you. This idea never even occured to your brilliant scientists.
</p>

<p>
	Self-improvement is a non-zero sum game. It makes no difference what the others guys are doing. Just improve yourself.
</p>

<p>
	There are millions of single women just waiting for a great guy to come along. A great guy is not born, he is self-made.

	If you live in the UK then the best place for pickup is obviously London.
</p>

<p>
	Look, all the best cities will be pricier than living in a village.
</p>

<p>
	There are tons of great big cities in Europe for game. It's more a function of where you are allowed to go, where you wanna live, and what nationality of girl you like.
</p>

<p>
	London is probably one of the best places in the world for game.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Easy. Shadow is sorta just the inverse of ego. Anything you think that isn't you and should not exist.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you think rapists should not exist, that's your shadow. You fail to accept that you are all the rapists in the world. This denial of rape is ego. It comes from fear, not Love.
</p>

<p>
	If you were infinitely conscious you would realize and accept that you are a rapist, thereby healing the division between you and the rapey part of reality. The rapey part of reality is your shadow. It's that part of yourself which you have disowned in order to maintain an ego.

			Yes, but the timeline of events doesn't suggest it was. The story as presented does not fit in with his methadone being adulterated with fentanyl to a significant degree or at all, as one would not expect him to wake up 2 hours later un-befuddled.

<p>
	If he got it on the black market, it could easily be diluted with fentanyl.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like to get a legal prescription requires that one be an opioid addict, which, if this guy was, is the source of the problem.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt you can just go to a doctor and say, "Hey, I'm having trouble sleeping, could you give me some methodone?"
</p>

<p>
	The only folks I know who get legal methodone are hardcore heroin addicts in rehab clinics. But I could be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	If this dude was an addict, all bets are off. He could have all sorts of drugs in his system. We really need to know his history of drug use.

<p>
	DMT has a very distinct appearance, texture, smell, and feel.
</p>

<p>
	Vape a tiny amount of it and smell it and feel it.
</p>

<p>
	Using a test kit you can easily identify if the powder is a psychedelic vs something else. If it is a psychedelic then it's hard to go wrong with a small dose.

	A shadow is any aspect of yourself/Universe which you demonize, judge, and hate because you think it is not your self.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you hate Nazis, you are not conscious that you are actually hating your own self.
</p>

<p>
	Well, JP has done that with stage Green. He is waging a war on himself without realizing it. And it kills him inside.

<p>
	Start with 10mg
</p>

<p>
	10mg of basically any tryptamine will not kill you and will rarely produce a super strong trip.
</p>

<p>
	10mg is a safe starting point for plugging almost anything.

<p>
	In the end you NEVER know. Which is why every chem has to be tested with tiny amounts to start.
</p>

<p>
	The nice thing with vaping is that you can take tiny puffs and slowly dial up. But still, a cocky noob could mess this up by taking a giant rip.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Vaping itself will not be lethal unless something else is wrong, but vaping will surely amplify any errors.
</p>

<p>
	Stopping breathing from plugging is just realistically not gonna happen. It's not so rapid or intense. Vaping a large dose can cause breathing problems because a large vaped dose will hit you like a sledgehammer and multiply any complications by 5x.
</p>

<p>
	It ought to be something more than just vaping to kill you. Unless for some rare genetic anomoly.
</p>

<p>
	It would help to know if this guy had ever done 5-MeO or DMT before and how he handled it.

The LSD blotter especially might have a problem fully dissolving.

<p>
	Next time try orally.

<p>
	If DMT and 5-MeO dosages were confused AND he had other stuff still in his system like methadone, that might be enough.
</p>

<p>
	Or it might be a problem with adulterants in the substance depending on how he sourced it.
</p>

<p>
	Very unfortunate to hear.
</p>

<p>
	But he was taking methadone?? Isn't that like heroin? How did he source it? If it was not from a good source it might have contained fentanyl which is very lethal.
</p>

<p>
	It does not make sense that a single hit of 5-MeO-DMT would kill a man. And what was the dose? Was it really 5-MeO or something else? More info needed before drawing conclusions.
</p>

<p>
	To stop breathing on 5-MeO would require a big dose and she should have been able to help him regain breathing if he stopped.
</p>

<p>
	An important precaution is to always start very low and gradually ramp up. And really, plug it instead of vaping.
</p>

<p>
	On the one hand it's admirable.
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand, to spend that much time developing a theory which is fundamentally false is a tragedy. And really that is his biggest problem: he is lost in his thinking mind. If I did what he did, I would go fucking insane. It would be very mentally unhealthy.

			You know, big part of the reason I started with pickup is to able to be myself around other people in general and to express myself fully. To not walk in this stiffled state all the time. Other thing with this approach is, what happens once I stop with approaching girls? When I get a girl friend or a wife? I would expect my confidence will go down quite a bit.

<p>
	It doesn't matter. Pickup will increase your social confidence permanently across the board. You will become better at talking to strangers, barbers, taxi drivers, clerks, shopkeepers, etc.

	RSD's original live Hotseat weekend seminars were definitely worth the $300.
</p>

<p>
	The live footage blows your mind open as far as what you imagine is possible in game.
</p>

<p>
	Although a lot of the game is deliberately flashy and not really as practical as less flashy methods. But still that flashy game can build up your confidence and balls.
</p>

<p>
	The original Hotseat helped me grow the balls to do some ballsy direct approaches which was important in my development.

	In fairness to JP, this is the best interview of him I've seen, presenting him in good light:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">

</div>

<p>
	JP does have some sophisticated and important ideas. His psychological insights are usually valid.
</p>

<p>
	It's mostly his anti-Green politics that are the problem.

It could be nice to have that degree in your pocket when applying for some jobs.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, if you definitely know that your LP and future career will not have anything to do with law, then it's probably a formality and a waste of time and money. 7 months is a lot of time that you could invest into your LP.
</p>

<p>
	A lack of degree is not going to keep you from success in your LP if you're truly serious and passionate about it. At worst it will be a minor annoyance.
</p>

<p>
	If you're super-limited by finances then maybe go for the degree if you will need it to get your first job and hold you over. But if your finances allow it, I would shoot directly for your LP.
</p>

<p>
	That sunk cost effect is a bitch.
</p>

<p>
	One thing I can tell you for sure, your heart will glow the moment you stop doing law and your passion and motivation will flourish. There's nothing that weight the heart down more than doing projects that you know hold zero meaning for you.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you lack an awakening into the nature of what "other" is.
</p>

<p>
	You're just not conscious of that facet of awakening yet.
</p>

<p>
	Like it told you, there are dozens of different facets and kinds and degrees of awakening. You're still missing many important facets which is why you're confused.

<p>
	Of course there's nothing outside of God's perspective.
</p>

<p>
	You need to become so fucking conscious that even the notion of multiple perspectives collapses. There are not multiple perspectives. There is only one perspective.
</p>

<p>
	You see the problem? You are constructing all of "reality" and yet you're trying to treat this as though there is some reality outside your constructions. But how would it come to exist unless you constructed it?
</p>

<p>
	Nothing can exist unless you fool yourself into believing it does. That's how stuff comes into existence! Stop taking existence for granted. Stuff doesn't just exist all by itself. It only exists in the mind of God (YOU).
</p>

<p>
	You're not gonna understand this without psychedelics.

<title>Psychotherapy for improving my social life?</title>

<p>
	Personally I haven't gotten any self-esteem boost from mindfulness meditation. It's just not designed for that.
</p>

<p>
	I think therapy can be positive if you have some childhood trauma which sources your low self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
	I'd say the #1 solution to this problem is going out regularly, socializing regularly, and taking to attractive girls regularly so that you feel them getting attracted to you. As you attract more of them you will start to feel better about yourself and develop some confident and shatter some limit beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	The #2 solution is psychedelics, which are far more powerful than any therapy at getting you to truly love yourself. Basically, psychedelics will do what therapy does but 100x deeper, faster, and cheaper. But they will be more emotionally taxing and challenging because you'll be accomplishing more work in less time.
</p>

<p>
	You won't understand what true self-love or self-acceptance is until you do some psychedelics. No therapist can explain you this because they themselves don't have it or know it.
</p>

	It simply won't work and I told him that. The women will just get addicted and attached to the feelings of love, and these will be feelings of conditional love, not Absolute Love with detachment. And then they will get their heart broken as those attachments necessarily shatter. He thinks these women will be able to maintain a sort of enlightened detachment -- but of course they won't. Not even close, because they would first need to do 10 years of consciousness work for that even be thinkable.
</p>

<p>
	It's not like this hasn't been tried in the past with disaterous consequences. But Connor believes he can do it better and avoid all the traps because he is here to awaken the world through materialistic means.

<p>
	Connor has a sort of blind optimism where he feels that he can do no wrong and everything will just work out as long as his intentions are good.
</p>

<p>
	I am not so optimistic about human nature.
</p>

<p>
	He believes that as long as one is "fully awake" then one can do no wrong, and if one does wrong then one is not "fully awake".
</p>

<p>
	Of course I have always taught the exact opposite of that. No matter how awake you are, self-deception and devilry is always luring right around the corner. No amount of awakening will save you from mistakes and wrong-doing. That requires extreme vigilance, which he doesn't care too much about. Hence evil will happen. But he disagrees.

<p>
	Spirituality is a long process. Best to pace yourself and focus on doing the daily practices diligently.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind will go through hundreds and even thousands of highs, lows, states, reactions, backlashes, opinions, stories, fantasies, etc. over the years of practice. Don't get too wrapped up in that. Keep your eye on the ball.

	Please note: while Connor can do as he likes on his own channels, this forum will not be used for outrageous clickbait, drama, and other such self-promotional games. I am not going to be giving publicity to people who engage in deliberate attention-whoring or who give spirituality or psychedelics an unhinged look for the sake of clicks.
</p>

<p>
	My general rule is to not engage with response videos or attention-seekers.

<p>
	Well, I had a good long conversation with Connor and we discussed plenty of traps involved in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Overall he's a lot more reasonable than he appears in his zany videos. His videos are overly dramatic for views and clicks. I'm not concerned for his mental health. He seems stable and happy and he has a pretty good grasp of nonduality. The only concern besides the image problems he creates for himself is some of the bold plans he has for teaching people awakening via Tantric sex, which I think is not gonna be effective and will be ripe for hurt/abuse. We've discussed the dangers and he's aware of my concerns but ultimately it's his business and it has nothing to do with what I teach. His and my styles and standards for teaching are very different. He likes a flamboyant and dramatic approach. I explained to him the dangers of that. He is open to feedback but also a firm believer in his approach and techniques.
</p>

<p>
	Connor's a decent guy from what I can tell and perhaps in 5 or 10 years he will make a solid teacher as his style matures. He's quite young and cocky so of course the maturity is still lacking, but that's to be expected for someone his age.
</p>

<p>
	We had little disagreement on the substance of nonduality or God. Our differences lie in style, attitude, and values. What he learned from me is not the style but some metaphysical and epistemic articulations which helped him make sense of his psychedelic awakening experiences.
</p>

<p>
	He was enjoyable to talk to. I wish him well.
</p>

<p>
	Stan Grof wrote entire books about "spiritual emergencies" and "spiritual crises".
</p>

<p>
	This is very, very common in the spiritual world. If you're going to practice hardcore spirituality you will almost certainly face a spiritual emergency at some point if you go deep enough. Many people don't go deep enough so they don't understand. And this is not exclusive to psychedelics. Hardcore meditation can be just as challenging.
</p>

<p>
	Smoke enough salvia and you'll have a spiritual emergency, I promise. Salvia will scare the living daylight out of you. It will wipe away your whole reality within seconds and you will cry for mommy like a little girl. And there will be no mercy with salvia. It will not treat you with kid gloves like some other psychedelics. Just as you're begging for mercy it will rip your face off.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	The kind of insight I'm talking about is a total state of awakening and infinite consciousness that you become. It's nothing that can ever be mistaken and it cannot be validated or invalidated by any other human.
</p>

<p>
	When you become infinitely conscious -- that's it. You are more conscious than any of these gurus and teachers. You are equally conscious to God. You ARE God. The end. All gurus and teachings become a joke. Become so conscious that every guru looks like an idiot.
</p>

<p>
	You are God. Don't let any fool convince you otherwise. They have no clue what God means. God is not merely no-self. And God is not merely some void. These are all inferior and reductionistic nondual understandings. They are not as high or as deep as God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	Do not stop until you hit INFINITY.
</p>

<p>
	Not necessary.
</p>

<p>
	You can practice physical escalation at the club on random girls.
</p>

<p>
	Physical game is a huge part of learning game. Practice it for a few months at a busy nightclub and you'll get pretty good.

		</p>

		<p>
			A few years ago I was in a club with friends. We had very pure MDMA crystals which we eyeballed (I know it was incredibly stupid), it was for sure the highest dose I ever took, just unimaginable euphoria, might even be on the edge of serotonin syndrome. So we took it + a few shots of vodka before entering the club and in the club as well. So here I was dancing on the most disinhibiting drug combo imaginable MDMA and drunk. A girl started to grind on my dick, I backed up in crippling fear, she looked back at me and smiled, she was very persistent trying to do that a few more times yet my fear managed to cripple me completely. Essentially my inhibitions were too high even on super drug combo, what chances do I have sober? After that night I let go of even trying at all to get girls because I thought that unless I will get some amygdala removal surgery, there's no way for me to ever get pussy.

	Women get upset when guys hurt women. But women don't give a fuck when women hurt guys.

<p>
	I'm not judging. Just saying how it tends to work. Of course guys also generally don't care when they hurt women. The not-caring is so profound that neither sex is even aware of it.

<p>
	Go out and talk to girls.
</p>

<p>
	You're making this too complicated with your horrible inner game.
</p>

<p>
	The proper inner game is this: Stop thinking and GO OUT AND TALK TO GIRLS!
</p>

<p>
	I used to be very insecure. Until I started going out and hot girls slowly started to get attracted to me. That changed my inner game because you can't believe "I'm not good looking enough" once a hot girl is eager to suck your dick.
</p>

<p>
	If you talk to 100s of girls you will notice that a few of them really love you. It's a numbers game.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe you can't, then you can't. If you believe you can, then you can. Be ware of how your mind constructs reality.
</p>

<p>
	That's right, anything can be rationalized.
</p>

<p>
	I don't date non-single girls nor do I recommended it. Like I said, I was pushing the envelope in that case to see how game works. Sometimes in life you gotta push the envelope to see where the boundaries are. Dating is an arena which is full of collateral damage and hurt feelings. This is something to learn and accept about dating. Which is not to say you should use this as license to cheat and hurt people needlessly.

<p>
	One time I flirted with a married woman just to see how far she would go. Her husband was a well-known guy in Vegas. She went pretty far. Don't forget that not all women are angels.

<p>
	Who told you to worry?
</p>

<p>
	Be good, if you want. Be bad if you want. Either way is Good.
</p>

<p>
	If you are looking for reasons to be good, you haven't understood goodness.

<p>
	It may be wiser to invest this time working on some other area of your life, freeing up time for when the masks go away.

<title>*POLL* Are you going to take a COVID-19 Vaccine?</title>

<p>
	For all you spiritual types, the idea of sitting around and waiting for tens of millions of other people to take the vaccine out of some silly fears isn't a very good sign of your leadership or collective responsibility. Your tiny bit of fear, blown way out of all proportion, will costs thousands of lives.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it like this, when you grandparents were called to go fight and die in WWII, they did it. Yet when you are asked to take a virtually harmless vaccine to save the lives of thousands, you fear it like a bullet to the head and act like a selfish jackass.
</p>

<p>
	Indeed, how entitled and pussified stage Green has become. This whole topic should go into the stage Green cringe compilation thread.
</p>

<p>
	Where is the conscious leadership? I see very little.

<p>
	There's nothing horrifying about a void. If you're experiencing horror, that's obviously an egoic emotional reaction and NOT void.
</p>

<p>
	The Void is meaningless. Which means it cannot be bad. And in fact, it is Love, since its a perfect Unity.

<p>
	Totally different. Neediness is not so repulsive in women, although it can also get annoying after a while. A needy girl will get used and abused. Her neediness is a problem more for herself than the guy.

<p>
	By 3 hours your hands should be on her ass.

<p>
	On dates you gotta keep things light, playful, and lots of physical touching. And you gotta bounce around to multiple locations. Don't just sit in one place for 3 hrs.

<p>
	I tell it like it is.
</p>

<p>
	This was 8 years ago. I was in training and my job was to push every set to its breaking point.
</p>

<p>
	If this offends you, oh well. You don't really understand women until you see how far you can push it.
</p>

<p>
	Women are not as innocent as they'd like to have you believe. If she really loved her boyfriend she would have never agreed to go on a date with me.

	It's not about tact. It's about showing guys what's possible and how to overcome excuses. An important part of game is getting over all your limiting beliefs about what's possible.
</p>

<p>
	I tell you some brutal aspects of game to toughen you guys up cause ya'll are a bunch of sissies up in here.

<p>
	Omg, man, you gotta move on to other girls. This is needy as fuck and it repels chicks.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta bite the bullet and cure your neediness by talking to lots of girls and never falling into this kind of neediness again.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't love, it's just a crush and it is meaningless. There are tons of other girls. As soon as you get this needy with one, you're done. It's dead forever. You killed it before it even began. Even if she magically slept with you, nothing good or healthy would come of it.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is, no girl is that special. She only seems that special to you because you're so needy.
</p>

<p>
	The feminine generally values feelings over truth.
</p>

<p>
	Although of course Love and Truth are identical.
</p>

<p>
	The feminine will care more about not hurting your feelings than telling you the cold hard truth.
</p>

			Ive been deeply in this stage now for about 5 years and it feels confusing. It feels like I can't ever know the answers to what I want with my life because everything is relative. Here are some examples or the way my mind works -  Do I want a girlfriend or not? Well maybe I do but can I believe my thoughts maybe they are all self deceptions. Maybe the idea of a self deception is a deception.
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe just drop all these concepts. Should I keep the job I have now? My life is passing me by but what is time? What about all these concerns? They are just thoughts in the mind. Should I focus on them and make choices or let life flow naturally? I can observe my thoughts which often makes the thoughts disperse but i still need to make decisions.   I basically just come up with questions without any answers which just becomes confusing. I remember Leo talked about this in his 9 stages of ego development in the Pluralistic stage. Ive been here for a while and it seems confusing that there are no answers or concretes. 
		</p>

		<p>
			For a lot of my stage orange friends they don't have these problems. They just fall into life which they haven't designed for themselves settle find a job and a girl and seem content.
		</p>

		<p>
			Can anyone relate to this or have any comments?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, of course. That's the cost of grappling with relativity. Which is why most people suck at understanding relativity. There is a  period in your life that you must pass through where you feel lost in relativity and unable to make a decision as a result.
</p>

<p>
	I had a plan to shoot a video about this.
</p>

<p>
	But I already talked about the solution to some extent in my much under-rated video: Balancing Theory vs Practice

			If i did that shit in my city they would be like wtf leave me alone. Probably would be with headphones and even if they were not it would be quite weird and annoying.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	One time I was at the gym working out. Saw hot girl walk onto the treadmill to run. She was wearing headphones.
</p>

<p>
	As she's running, I walk up in front of her and do a big grin and a big wave. I motion for her to take off her headphones and get off the treadmill. She complies. I tell her she's cute and start chatting her up. She tells me she has a boyfriend. I grab her number anyway. We go on a date. We make out. Her boyfriend was out of town and she was feeling lonely.
</p>

<p>
	Another time hot girl (25) is walking through the mall talking on her phone. I run in front of her, stop her, and ask her who she's talking to. She says her mom. I tell her to hang up on her mom and talk to me instead. She complies. We flirt and exchange numbers. Then we go on a date and have great sex. Stunning girl.
</p>

<p>
	I once met a guy who banged something like 100 women at the mall. He would fuck them in the dressing room.
</p>

<p>
	STOP. MAKING. EXCUSES.
</p>

<p>
	Women are everywhere. Go talk to them.

<p>
	You see, the way this game works is that my work will be demonized to the point that it has no impact on larger cultural. Which is exactly how a devil treats truth. All a devil has to do to win the battle against truth is to smear the truth with his own shit.

	Sadhguru was accused of killing his wife in the paper!
</p>

<p>
	"Godman Charged With Wife's Murder" was the headline.

<p>
	And to this day people accuse him of it.

<p>
	If Adeptus did a video on Sadhguru, he would be calling him a wife-murderer.
</p>

<p>
	This is what happens when arrogant and ignorant people start judging spiritual people. An ignorant person cannot see "mahasamdhi", he can only see murder. He cannot see siddhis, he can only see delusion. Because anything outside his paradigm is either insane, delusional, criminal, or evil.
</p>

<p>
	If Adeptus careful listened to my epistemological teachings he might understand the traps he's falling into with his rash judgments and moralizations. It's a basic error of failing to account for the relativity of perspectives.

			I'm not sure if Logically I think she's better than me. I think it has to do with some deep down karma of my ego. It's just my hurted ego. Deep down I know I'm cool as fuck, thanks to Spirituality . But old conditionings keep doing this growth so freaking slow. As you said, the fact that I'm not approaching doesn't help either. Until I really approach I assume I won't really change do my conditionings will remain the same I guess.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Simply make a rule that if you see a really hot girl, you MUST approach no matter how cringe.
</p>

<p>
	The funny thing about really hot girls is that very few guys have the balls to directly approach them.
</p>

<p>
	One time a saw an absurdly hot girl at Qdoba eating her food alone at a little round table. So I got my food and just sat down right at her little table like I was her boyfriend and started eating my food and talking about myself. She told me she had a dick (shit test). I told her I LOVE dick (passed shit test). Eventually she asked me to take her number.
</p>

<p>
	No one has the balls to do that kind of thing and it comes off extremely attractive.
</p>

<p>
	3 suggestions:
</p>

<p>
	1) Build a rock solid confidence that if you continue doing this work diligently one day you'll realize the Truth. I have been doing this work seriously for about 6 years now and it has never even crossed my mind that I will fail. Because I care about Truth too much to even entertain such a possibility. Don't allow failure to be an option.
</p>

<p>
	2) Don't listen to your mind when it tries to stop you. Practice a bit each day. I spent many years of just doing 30 minutes or 60 minutes of daily meditation practice while going about my business life. You can easily make 30-60 mins a day of looking at your hand. This work is a slow burn. You must pace yourself for a decade of practice. It will pay off, but not immediately.
</p>

<p>
	3) Try to enjoy it. Enjoy just sitting and being conscious. Enjoy meditation. Enjoy looking at your hand. Life does not get any better than sitting and looking at your hand. Spiritual work is not about getting somewhere. It's about enjoy the present moment more and more. The only place you're trying to get to with spiritual work is RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. THIS! THIS! THIS! THIS! THIS. IS. IT.

<p>
	Dude, you have no clue what hell and ungrounded states people like Tolle, Sadhguru, or Mooji went through in their awakening process.
</p>

<p>
	If any of these people live-streamed their entire spiritual journey, you would think of them as insane lunatics. With these old-ass gurus you're only seeing the end result of a 30 or 40 year process. Connor is showing you a bit of the actual process for a young, arrogant, materialistic guy like himself.
</p>

<p>
	Did you know that Peter Ralston used to jump off a rooftop and make his students catch him, otherwise he would kill himself if they did not? Did you know that Sadhguru handled pounds of raw mercury in the building of his temple in India which probably gave him terrible mercury poisoning that almost killed him? Did you know that Tolle was suicidally depressed and on the verge of killing himself? Did you know that Shinzen Young was a hardcore drug addict?
</p>

<p>
	Imagine THAT live-streamed.
</p>

<p>
	Exactly.
</p>

<p>
	It's beyond foolish to judge another's spiritual journey in the way that Adeptus does.
</p>

<p>
	Interesting framing.
</p>

<p>
	So if I supported Connor Murphy, I would be a monster enabling a false god. And if I say that he's going down the road of Zen devilry, then it is "strange" and I'm also to blame for creating him. Even though I have an entire video explaining the dangers of Zen devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Heads I win, tails you lose.
</p>

<p>
	My teachings are not an ideology and being God is not an ideology. I have no idea what Connor Murphy is doing and I have never endorsed whatever he's doing. Until a few weeks ago, I had no idea he even watches me. And just cause he watches a few of my videos means nor says nothing. You have no idea who else he might be following, what books he might be reading, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's also not a good idea to judge Connor's psychological state too much. He's clearly going through a spiritual process, which he is recording live, so of course it will not look stable or "proper" the way that people expect.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, if Eckhart Tolle live-streamed his awakening as it happened, everyone would be saying that Tolle has lost his mind and needs professional help. There's no reason why Connor cannot stabilize and become a solid teacher some years down the road once he gets some of the Zen devilry out of his system.
</p>

<p>
	Nobody is born as a solid spiritual master. You become a master by going through decades of trail and error and spiritual mistakes.
</p>

<p>
	Judging Connor's process is not very wise. Let the man go through whatever he needs to go through. Connor is recording the actual process of waking up. It's a brutal process. I experience similar pushback from people when I release raw, unedited videos of my process. Any deviation from propriety is ridiculed and judged. People expect you to be like Eckhart Tolle or Sadhguru, all happy and calm. Which is a joke.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I have no interest any more in releasing raw, honest footage of my own process. People will just ridicule it and not understand. People don't want raw honesty, they want fake spiritual perfection.
</p>

<p>
	As far as the theatrics, gimmickry, and business schemes that Connor engages in -- none of that aligns with my teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I should say, this Adeptus guy is strawmanning the shit out of my spiritual realizations. I have never claimed to be any kind of messiah nor have I ever claimed that I can heal all of mankind through miracles. His portrayal of my insights is basically slander.
</p>

<p>
	Everything I said in my spiritual videos is still true:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I am God (but so are you)
	</li>
	<li>
		I have been more conscious than most spiritual teachers or gurus
	</li>
	<li>
		Psychic abilities are real
	</li>
	<li>
		Healing is real and possible, although of course it is not a power the ego controls and it will not magically heal the whole world. When I spoke about these powers I clearly said this is still something I'm exploring and struggling to develop.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These claims are not so crazy. Any serious spiritual practitioner understands that claims #1, #3, and #4 are obviously correct. They might dispute claim #2, but, oh well, that's just a common spiritual dispute that every spiritual person has at some point.
</p>

<p>
	I have not backtracked on any "psychic superpower nonsense" because siddhis are not nonsense -- they are a well-known aspect of spiritual work which has existed among serious spiritual practitioners since the dawn of time. What's nonsense is Adeptus' absurd strawmanning of a guy who mentions siddhis. That is coming from a place of arrogance,  ignorance, and closedmindedness. I have in fact NEVER claimed to have supernatural powers. But I know people who do and I know they can be developed by certain people (not even necessarily me). My work and teachings have NEVER been about supernatural powers or showing off in the manner of Connor Murphy.
</p>

<p>
	Adeptus misunderstand what happened with me. It's not that I backed off of anything I said. It's simply that when I said those things I discovered states of consciousness that virtually no human has ever accessed and I said things in a raw fashion as part of showing people the raw work that I was in the middle of doing. But when I show raw work like that, people now expect me to be unhinged forever, but of course, in fact I'm very well grounded and they are shocked when they see me come back the next week or month and record very grounded videos, taking this to mean that I'm contradicting myself when in fact I've just integrated the raw realizations from before -- as you're supposed to do.
</p>

<p>
	The thing to understand is this: When I show a video of a raw awakening or a post-retreat debrief, I'm not in a fully grounded state (of course), and this is shown to the viewer specifically to give you a taste of what this work feels like because otherwise the viewer gets the false impression that this work is always grounded and that I am some stoic, emotionless, autistic robot. Out of 300+ of my grounded videos, Adeptus cherrypicks 2 raw live awakening videos and a pre-retreat and post-retreat video that came after an intense 30 straight days of 5-MeO-DMT, to demonize my entire teaching and build his biased narrative. Watch the other 300+ videos for context. And if you dare, let's see how your first video will look after 30 straight days of 5-MeO-DMT breakthroughs. I'll bet you'll be a bit emotional and glowing with insight. I sacrificed myself for the sake of psychedelic science and this is the shit I get from my fellow psychonaut? Not only do I get shit from non-psychonauts about this non-stop, now I have to deal with shit from psychonauts too?
</p>

<p>
	Adeptus, if you read this, please stop with your whiteknight routine. I know you mean well, but you're getting carried away with your good-guy act and you are unwittingly slandering my work. My work is more grounded than your rants, so please spare me the outrage. Connor Murphy is his own man and I am not responsible for whatever zany shit he decides to do. I will however email Connor and try to have a talk with him about the dangers of presenting these ideas to the public so that awakening, psychedelics, and "I am God" are not mis-perceived by the public. I very much care about that. Whether he will even listen to me is questionable. I am not his daddy and to frame me that way is irresponsible in and of itself. This guy is a total stranger to me. He's not any kind of formal student of mine. What you're doing is akin to someone watching your YouTube videos about psychedelics, taking a massive dose of 1000ug LSD, jumping out the window, killing himself, and then people blaming you for it because, hey, Adeptus told him that psychedelics are good, despite all the warnings you issued. That's exactly what you're doing to me in the name of playing a whiteknight with your moral outrage. Excuse me, but who died and made you the Pope of psychedelics? Just because someone has a different process than you with psychedelics that you disagree with does not make you right nor does it give you the moral high ground to judge them for it. You don't like me enjoying 5-MeO-DMT in a bathtub? You think that's dangerous? Well, that's just, like, your opinion, man. You have no clue of my actual situation when I did that.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are dangerous. Spiritual work is dangerous. I've always said that. In the hands of a fool psychedelics and/or spiritual work can get you killed. But the Truth is the Truth regardless. The Truth is, psychedelics can show you that you are God. And it doesn't matter how many people get killed, the Truth will always remain the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Also: Connor Murphy was NOT banned from the forum. Some of his posts were so self-promotional (promoting donations to his Patreon account) that our good Mods were right to moderate some of it. He is still free to post here and he has not contacted me personally for advice. If he did, I would gladly offer it. But I would never presume to go around telling another teacher or YouTuber how to run his business. I didn't give Connor advice because I didn't feel he would be receptive to it.
</p>

<p>
	All of the above is so obvious that I hardly feel it needs to be stated. I have never felt a need to state it until now, but now I'm forced to state it because clearly people like Adeptus got some really wrong ideas about my teachings and how spiritual development works and now I feel I have to publicly correct this slander and strawmanning. It's bad enough that my work is slandered by all sorts of ignorant noobs, materialists, and religious fundamentalists -- I expect that -- but when my work is slandered by a fellow psychonaut who should have a deep understanding of the trickeries of this work -- that leaves me disappointed. Since day one of my teachings I have always spoken out about the dangers and traps of psychedelics, spiritual work, ideology, cults, and self-deception. I have always steered people away from irresponsible use of psychedelics and Zen devilry.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is this: give a man some room to spiritually develop without breathing down his neck and telling him everything he's doing wrong. That is, if you're truly compassionate and care about his development. But if you want to create sensational YouTube rant videos, I guess that's another matter. But if you care about truth, be careful how your mind constructs convenient narratives to explain away stuff like what's going on with Connor Murphy. The bottom line is that you have no idea what he's going through and what the right process is for him.
</p>

<p>
	If you, Adeptus, ever want to correct the record, I'm more than happy to explain all this publicly with you. My work is grounded and it will always remain grounded and I will always condemn teachings and teachers which are ungrounded.
</p>

<p>
	But of course, there truly is no ground <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

	As annoying as JP is, he should be allowed publish his book. Just cause an employee does not like JP's ideas does not mean they get to cancel his book.
</p>

<p>
	It's not like JP is Hitler. His political ideas are pretty much standard conservative dogma.

<title>Leo, question about fear/meditation</title>

<p>
	Meditation is a spiritual purification process. As you do it rigorously for years, the evil within you will slowly get purified. This process takes a lot of time.
</p>

<p>
	Fear being imaginary is the ultimate culmination of the spiritual purification process. It will take you a lot of work to reach that point. And to reach that point you'll be forced to confront your deepest fears, including the fear of death, insanity, torture, and whatever supernatural forces you fear.
</p>

<p>
	If you fear demons then you must face that fear and realize it is an illusion -- not the demons, but your fear of them.
</p>

<p>
	Once you trip it will be so profound all these dumb techniques will fly out the window.

<p>
	The whole point of tripping is that it cuts through all the human spiritual bullshit. You don't need anything but a curious and open mind.

<p>
	"Guru" is also a Hindu concept.
</p>

<p>
	But you got spiritual teachers in literally all cultures. You will not find a single culture in which spiritual masters don't exist.
</p>

<p>
	That's a pretty astounding fact when you think about it.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Oh the excuses the mind will concoct just to not approach a girl.
</p>

<p>
	IF you were great at being authentic around hot girls and approaching them consistently without fear, you would already be a master of pickup.
</p>

<p>
	But you ain't. Your game sucks balls, hence the existence of pickup.
</p>

<p>
	Med student: What if the only reason I'm going to med school is because I'm afraid I will kill someone with my lack of medical experience? If I was absolutely secure and confident in my ability to heal people, would I even be going to med school? Probably not.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. You also have a bunch of wrong ideas about what pickup is. It's not about tricking girls into sleeping with you.
</p>

Now i would assume these incels are small minority but these are the ones that make the channels that get all the views and stuff. Maybe they are lying about their efforts? Who knows? One of the most toxic ones i talked with said that he did 100 approaches and got rejected very harshly and it really hurt his ego and shit. I mean you said you did like 400 but 100 approaches, how many guys do 100 approaches honestly? Very few. I feel like there is SOME truth to the blackpill, maybe as much truth as there is to most toxic ideologies out there
		</p>

<p>
	They simply have no idea how to approach nor how to close. Cold approach has an extremely steep learning curve. A guy indoctrinated with Incel/Black Pill ideology will have such horrible inner game that of course no woman will get attracted to him. He might as well rub a skunk on his face. That's what Incel ideology does to a man's attractiveness. And his outer game will suck just as much.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be talking to Nazis. They are less brainwashed than these Black Pill guys.
</p>

<p>
	The fact that you take these ideologies seriously is already the problem.

	It's just victim mentality, scapegoating, projection, denial, and all the other classic ego defense mechanisms that the ego employs when it is scared, hurt, and denied love.
</p>

<p>
	What's changed is that thanks to the internet and video games, lots of men have stopped socializing face-to-face, which makes getting laid impossible. An Incel is just a guy who doesn't socialize.
