	There is nothing more addictive to the ego-mind than an ideology which brings in $$$, fame, and pussy. That's a lethal combo.

<title>Business toxifying my PASSION/LIFE PURPOSE</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/30015-business-toxifying-my-passionlife-purpose/?do=findComment&amp;comment=350135</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/9-life-purpose-career-entrepreneurship/">Life Purpose, Career, Entrepreneurship</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/7387-optimize/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="7387" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/7387-optimize/" rel="">@optimize</a> First of all, these are quality problems. Acknowledge how far you've come. You've build something rare and you ain't done yet.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, yeah! Welcome to survival! Survival is a cut-throat activity. It is not easy to balance between business & art. It is not easy to run a conscious business. Which is why virtually no body does it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, your business can get fucked at any time, and if you neglect it for too long, it will probably die. Such is life. There is no life without death. The solution is to accept it and face your fear of failure/business-death. I used to get these fears a lot. I still get them to some extent but a lot less so after my many mystical experiences, which teach me that death is inevitable and nothing to be afraid of. After you experience a few physical deaths, business death doesn't seem so serious any more.
</p>

<p>
	That said, if you are going to be running a business you should run it well, strategically. Think about ways to make your business more future-proof and self-sustaining. You can do that without being paranoid about it. Make the distinction between being strategic and proactive vs being paranoid. You can do one without doing the other and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	Of course your survival is tied to your business performance. Business IS survival. The solution here it is not get too wrapped up in survival. Yes, survival is necessary but don't make your entire life about survival. Don't make your entire business about survival. You must skillfully evolve your business beyond survival to incorporate play, artistry, beauty, and consciousness. This must be done while still keeping one eye on your finances. Just like how an artist cannot paint all day long without eating food. But it would be a mistake for him to get so paranoid about food that all he does all day is eat food and never paints. A balance must be struck between eating food and making art. Likewise between business and art.
</p>

<p>
	Most successful entrepreneurs end up workaholics. You should probably make time for other stuff like relationships, travel, spirituality, etc. Do that without neglecting your business. If you're earning $100,000 you should have enough money to hire a bit of extra help. Consider hiring an online contractor to help you out. Consider how to align your art with your biz.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I always feel a desire to grow and expand my biz. But I have to be disciplined and say NO! to lots of opportunities because biz is not as important as spirituality, for example. I pass up on a lot of opportunities because biz cannot be your #1 priority in the end. That way lies disaster.
</p>

<p>
	How do I handle fears of my business getting fucked? At this point I've basically stopped caring. I've almost stopped caring if I die. This was made possible through spiritual work and profound mystical experiences which show me that biz and life are just a hallucination. None of my life or work really matter. This is all just a game. It's being done for fun and artistry. You could get run over by a bus tomorrow. So why worry about it? Getting over the fear of loss of my business took many years of work. It also helped that I saved up a comfortable nest egg. My YT channel could die tomorrow and I would still be able to live for 15 years without working. I strategically designed it this way. You can too. Not in a week, but in a few years time you could.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes I still think of the business aspects of things, but at this point in my life, career, and development I spend more time thinking about living in a cave than running a business. You are not at this point yet. Maybe you'll get there in 5-10 years of work. It all depends on what your goals are for your life. For me, the point of business is to enable my passion and artistry. Design your business such that it allows you to do your art. Artsy fartsy stuff is not waste of time if it part of your life purpose and your life purpose is fueling your biz. The whole point is to align all these things in a balanced way.
</p>

<p>
	If you set up your business properly, you should be able to take time off to pursue spirituality, travel, leisure, art, relationships, etc. That will take some years to actualize, but it's worth it. The first few years of building a business usually requires LOTS of hours of non-stop work. But the whole point of all that work is so that in the future your business is more or less on auto-pilot.
</p>

<p>
	Tie the artsy-fartsy stuff to the success of your biz.
</p>

<p>
	Remember the importance of dynamic balance. See my balance video.
</p>

<p>
	Have a long-term strategic plan.
</p>

<p>
	Automate, outsource, and streamline stuff as much as you can.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is always a psychological self-deception game. Your fear is something you want to contemplate and face head on. Just building your biz more is never going to solve the fear of losing your biz. Your biz could be making $1 billion per year and you'd still fear losing it. Even more so! Because fear is never based in reality, it is purely mental. So explore that. To really overcome fear you must do deep spiritual work. Fear is inevitable without enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, you're on the right track. Just fine-tune things and take it to the next level. Next level does not necessarily mean: more money & bigger biz. Next level means: a new balance, or action at a higher level of consciousness.
</p>

If daytrading offers no value, setting yourself up as a trainer of daytraders is just doubling down on the problem, you see? You are effectively creating a pyramid scheme. The whole point of a pyramid scheme is that it takes a product or service of no genuine value and makes it appear to have short-term value by convincing other people that it has value.
</p>

<p>
	If you realize that daytrading has little to no value, why are you positioning yourself to teach it to other people? You just geometrically multiplied your bad karma. It's as if I told you that robbing people's houses created bad karma so you come back to me and say, "What if I don't do any robbing myself but instead I train hundreds of people how to rob houses?" Lol
</p>

<p>
	Go create something which you know offers massive genuine value for mankind. Teach that!
</p>

<p>
	Do you really want to spend your precious time on this Earth teaching daytrading? Is that what you want your life to be remembered as: the daytrading guy? Is that really the best thing you can think of?
</p>

<title>LIVING WITH PARENTS FOR LIFE PURPOSE</title>

It was a bit humiliating and stifling but a necessary step towards actualizing my life purpose. After about 3 months I was making enough money to move out and live on my own. And I was even able to help pay for my Mom's apartment after she separated from my Dad.
</p>

<p>
	The key is to hustle and make shit happen. Don't be dicking around. Create results!
</p>

<p>
	Teach yourself how to survive in this world.

Most people need a rather large dose of it to break through, and the problem is, they are too afraid to do it. They do 1 or 2 small trips and call it quits before the breakthrough happens. Because the ego is hellbent on preventing enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics do not work on people who are not metaphysically curious and serious. This is not a pursuit for lazy people just dicking around. You have to be serious about reaching Truth. You have to be willing to try and fail many times. I have no respect for people who do 2 trips and call it quits.

The key is to keep your base desires well-regulated via consciousness and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, you can shit, but don't shit where you eat.
</p>

<p>
	You can have sex, but do so responsibly, authentically, and consciously.
</p>

<p>
	Or be an animal. It's up to you.

<p>
	Seriously though, the problem with people who have multiple partners is that they do not know how to relate consciously with 1 partner, nevermind 3 or 5.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like those parents who don't know how to raise or feed 1 child, yet they have 5. <img alt="¬¬" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/dry.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/dry@2x.png 2x" title="¬¬" width="20" />

<p>
	Classic case of biting off more than you can chew. It's a form of greediness.
</p>

<p>
	What is so lacking in you that you need any of that at all? << that's what you should contemplate.

<p>
	I don't see what's unclear about this. Kundalini takes time to fully awaken. Probably years of practice.

<p>
	Oh, I thought you meant inhaling nasally.
</p>

<p>
	Inhaling a mist into the lungs through the mouth is an interesting approach. No idea about that. Would require experimentation. Might irritate the lungs.

Don't expect others to solve the hard problems for you. Your role is to create solutions to all of those sticky problems like financing, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can start by studying & researching education theory. There are many serious scholars, experts, and academics working on the problems of education. But you should also realize that the biggest obstacles will always be bureaucratic, political, marketing, and financing.
</p>

<p>
	Education is a very touchy political issue. People are not just going to let you wake up their kids. They want their children properly indoctrinated.
</p>

<p>
	It will be very challenging to pitch a stage Yellow school to stage Blue/Orange parents in a stage Blue/Orange community.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about this vision, you should think of a way to gain 1st-hand experience with the actual issues of education. You can do this by getting a job within the education field and study it from the inside. Otherwise you will lack 1st-hand experience and your solutions will be utopian fantasies, not anything workable in the real world.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with lofty visions is that they also must square with how the real world works and the level of development that people are at. Coming up with grand visions is relatively easy. The hard part is figuring out how to actualize them.
</p>

<p>
	1) Clean up your diet
</p>

<p>
	2) Go to the gym regularly
</p>

<p>
	3) Contemplate any psychlogical anxiety issues you have which are creating this
</p>

<p>
	4) Get your testosterone levels checked via blood work.
</p>

<p>
	5) Try taking Maca supplement pills. They are crazy effective and all-natural. Natural Viagra that will make you a sex machine.

</p>

<p>
	Relationships are paradoxical. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't.
</p>

<p>
	But I don't find maintaining a harem to be too developed or conscious. In my experience people who do that are generally not too developed. They are thinking with their genitals which can't lead to anything good.

</p>

<p>
	I knew kids like that guy in elementary school. They would just draw all day long in class and they were fucking GOOD. My Mom is actually like that.
</p>

<p>
	From what I can gather, it requires a certain highly specialized brain type. Which then leads to 1000s of hours of practice because their brain type loves doing it.
</p>

<p>
	I would guess I'm the same as that guy, but with philosophy instead of art. To me philosophy is like an artform, and it comes as easily as that guy's drawings, but then there is also of course a ton of practice that goes into it.
</p>

<p>
	To do that much practice demands that you really love doing it.
</p>

<p>
	The older generations are not staying still. They too are evolving. Just not as fast as you whippersnappers would like.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, it's due to the rigidity of the mind. The mind is resistant to change. It's a fundamental survival mechanic.

Keep up your spiritual practices and don't get distracted by weird sensations. Weird sensations will arise and pass away. What you really want is to open that crown chakra and have an awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Educate yourself about Kundalini Awakening. Read some books about it. I have books on my book list about the ups and downs of the process.

There are of course many individual exceptions. So don't stereotype people too much.
</p>

<p>
	The main reason it's true is because as the infrastructure of society evolves lower survival needs becomes easier and easier to satisfy to the point where you don't need to even think about them. Older generations had to worry about a neighboring tribe raping and pillaging their village. Modern generations don't have this worry because government infrastructure (like the modern court and police system) has been built to prevent that.
</p>

<p>
	Your value system reflects the environment you're trying to survive in. As the environment evolves, so must your values, beliefs, and worldview if you wish to be effective at survival.
</p>

<p>
	A slave owner would not be able to survival for long in today's environment. But 500 years ago it was almost the opposite. Owning slaves raised your survival. Because the environment was so different. Humans have changed their environment so much that slavery became counter-productive. Which is why today slavery is no longer considered acceptable.
</p>

<p>
	The moral of the story is: your values are totally contingent on your survival needs, which change constantly as evolution progresses. And the rate of progress is accelerating. So newer generations are more different than they were in the past.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Inner affects the outer.
</p>

<p>
	Outer affects the inner.
</p>

<p>
	Because inner = outer. In truth everything is one! So work on both, work on THE ONE.
</p>

<p>
	If you're surrounded by an unhealthy, toxic environment, change it ASAP. That will free you up to do serious inner work. And if you're stuck in an environment with no idea of how to break free, change your inner game, which will allow you to escape that environment.
</p>

<p>
	You can burn the candle from both ends.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there definitely are generational differences as each generation of humans gets indoctrinated into newer, more advanced cultural ways of thinking.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like with smartphones. Each new generation of smartphones comes with new, more advanced software. It is hard to install the latest software on old hardware, mostly due to rigidity of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	I'll have a video on this topic in the future.

<p>
	Yes, but be careful what you wish for. They will not only show you stuff you've been hiding, they will give you a glimpse of insanity.

<p>
	Mushrooms have a trickster like quality to them. They will play tricks on you and fuck with your sense of reality in crazy ways at higher dosages.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Martin Ball writes & talks about that phenomenon a lot.
</p>

<p>
	When that happens all you gotta do is just remember to open your body up and be more symmetrical. This will help you surrender and open up your mind to the wisdom it's trying to download.

</p>

<p>
	In another sense: enlightenment has no opposite because Truth has no opposite. Falsehood is not really opposite of Truth because Truth is all there is and falsehood isn't really a thing (it is an illusion).
</p>

<p>
	From the unenlightened perspective enlightenment has an opposite.
</p>

<p>
	From the enlightened perspective there never was such a thing as unenlightenment. Enlightenment is TOTAL and ever-present. It is the only thing that is ever occurring, has ever occurred, or can ever occur.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment or nonduality means: no dualities, which means no opposites.
</p>

<p>
	You're basically asking: What is the opposite of no-opposites? Lol <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<title>Trip Report - Atlantis Truffles</title>

You don't want the full power of mushrooms just yet. They can be scary powerful at higher doses.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone has a unique tolerance level. Next time just dose a bit higher.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful though because truffle potency can vary from batch to batch depending on the exact species and how they are grown. Dosing natural mushrooms is a bit tricky because they are not standardized. Ideally you would acquire a large batch, test its potency by doing a low dose, and then you would have a good idea of how potent your batch is. If you acquire small batches, you might eat too much of a potent batch based off a less potent batch.
</p>

<p>
	When I take mushrooms it is always a standardized alcohol extract, not actual mushrooms, which delivers a very consistent potency dose. You might even want to just take pure 4-HO-DMT (psilocin) in synthetic chemical form for the most precise dosing. Precise and consistent dosing is very important if you're getting into serious tripping.
</p>

<p>
	1 or 2 trips is NEVER enough to understand psychedelics. To really understand you must be ready to experiment with 10-30 trips. And even then, you're just seeing the tip of the iceberg of tripping. It takes about 10-30 trips to start to make sense of how they work because there are so many variables at play. No one trip means much by itself. You must accumulate aggregate experience. Even at precisely the same dose and under identical set & setting you will have wildly different trips. Because the mind is chaotic. It is not a simple machine like a refrigerator.

<title>Is mainstream shamanism legit? (Assuming you get a good shaman)</title>

<p>
	Shamanism is legit, but I don't think you understand what shamanism is. Most shamanism doesn't even involve psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	It is not so hard to teach yourself how to trip properly. Do more research, do more experimentation, follow proper protocol as has been laid out in my videos and from many other sources.
</p>

<p>
	DMT is not a good starting psychedelic. It's way too powerful, too visual, and too fast-acting. Start with something less intense, like 1g of mushrooms or 125ug of LSD. Gradually work your way upwards, taking time to contemplate and integrate insights. Trip moderately but consistently over the course of a year or two and you should master the art of tripping.

<p>
	What matters more than the substance is your intention when using it.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA, mushrooms, and Aya should all be real good for that.
</p>

<p>
	Give mushrooms a try. They can be healing in a twisted sort of way.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA is great for PTSD.
</p>

<p>
	Since you say you've done a fair amount of psychedelics already perhaps what you're missing in contemplation. Try doing contemplation using a journal on your issue. THEN follow that up with more psychedelics. That will orient your trips in the right direction, yielding more clarity.

A lot. As they show you your authentic personality.
</p>

<p>
	1 trip is worth 100 videos.
</p>

<p>
	The problem of authenticity is so deep, it's not merely social or psychological, it's metaphysical. You can only really resolve the issue metaphysically. The ego is too terrified to really be authentic. It's a matter of life and death.
</p>

<p>
	Authenticity will only really come with the elimination of the ego. Which is not to say you can't or shouldn't do some self-help or psychological work. That can be useful. But it won't solve the root issue.

<p>
	This is almost always a lie. Such situations are almost never stable and filled with self-deception on both sides. In practice what happens is the women are deeply unsatisfied and end up dropping out after a year or two. And it only works from the guy's POV if he's constantly pulling new women into his harem. The guy is burning through women every year to maintain his rotation. But because he's so selfish he's blind to the suffering he's causing these women so it seems fine from his POV, as least until he becomes more conscious, at which point he'll see it and probably stop.
</p>

<p>
	Most women will be crushed when you tell them that you want to see other women. Imagine utter heart-break. That's what she felt when you told her that. It crushed her. To pretend otherwise is quite delusional.
</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself why you want polyamory. Watch out for egoic self-deception here.
</p>

<p>
	Figure out how to relate to one woman first before you start juggling 3 of them at once.
</p>

<p>
	Most guys who want to be with multiple women are immature and terrified of commitment, relationship & intimacy. That's what you really want to work on.

	I shot a video but I was having some sinus troubles so it didn't come out to my liking and it will be re-shot, as it's an important new topic.
</p>

<p>
	I usually try to get a video ready by Sunday, but if I'm unhappy with how it turned out, I would rather re-shoot it than to release something just to maintain an artificial schedule.

<p>
	But even aside from all of that, there is still another dimension: development.

	That's like going to bench press 500 lbs, failing, and then saying, "I don't think I will exercise ever again in my life. Exercise is dangerous and nasty."

<p>
	No, it's just that you did it foolishly.
</p>

<p>
	See how the ego tricked you?

<p>
	The proper way would have been to take 20 1-tab trips spaced out over the course of 2 years. Then you would have seen growth. But instead you let your ego trick you.

	The key is to really know your subject matter.
</p>

<p>
	So in fact there is lots of prep, but that prep is years of research behind the scenes until you know the topic like the back of your hand.

They will be working on and enjoying their results.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be successful you need a serious business and marketing strategy. Dicking around on YT or a forum is not gonna cut it.
</p>

<p>
	You need to get very serious about your work. Stop dicking around and go create something that offers massive value to the world, and do it smartly. Passion is no substitute for poor business strategy.

	3 years is more than enough to time to learn that you don't like something. Clearly you ain't passionate about that.

<p>

	Formless Tao is unchanging.

<p>
	Formed Tao is ever-changing.
</p>

<p>
	Formless Tao and Formed Tao are identical. But they can also be distinguished.
</p>

<p>
	Again, changing vs unchanging is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Tao vs non-Tao is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Mundane vs True Tao is a duality.

<p>
	Tao is ALL.

</p>

<p>
	It sounds like you just need to do a lot more contemplation, meditation, yoga, self-inquiry, and basic development work. LSD is a catalyst for all that.

You gotta keep in mind that the stuff you learn from me is extremely advanced stuff that takes years and decades to put in place. I share a very big picture of your potential, the downside of which is that it can seem impossible to achieve, so far away.
</p>

<p>
	This is sort of the curse of a lofty vision.
</p>

<p>
	Baby steps man. You are still super young and your whole life is ahead of you. You have plenty of time to create a great life.
</p>

<p>
	Focus now on building a vision and cultivating hope. You want to enjoy the process of assembling your life. It's fun. Don't make it a grind.

</p>

<p>
	Don't worry, this is just the first step. You don't need to resolve all your answers and get breakthroughs in 1 or 2 trips. You should have the attitude that you will trip 20+ times and in that time you will figure a lot of stuff out and have many breakthroughs.

	Try to avoid distracting yourself in future trips. Stay away from electronics and note-taking devices. Allow yourself to go fully into the trip. Stop anchoring yourself to your old reality.
</p>

<p>
	Do not place a bunch of goals and expectations on a trip. Your #1 goal when tripping should be to go wherever the trip takes you. Drop all expectations or needing it to show you certain things. Deep insights will come organically. Just relax, surrender, and be ready to explore. Metaphysical curiosity is all you really need.
</p>

<p>
	When you trip, try not to move around so much. Sit still with eyes open, upright, fully alert -- like a meditation retreat.
</p>

<p>
	No, I don't consider infinite intelligence the Akashic Records. Akashic Records are supposed to be a database of the universe's entire history. Infinite intelligence is devoid of content. It is pure and formless. You will not find any historical memories or events in it.
</p>

<p>
	High doses of psychedelics are probably good for accessing the Records. I have yet to verify that.
</p>

<p>
	Or it might require some psychic talent. I'm not very psychic.

How to you want your music to affect others? Therein lies the selfless part.

<p>
	I agree he shares some good wisdom and insights. Many cult leaders share valuable insights.
</p>

<p>
	I'm all for learning from multiple sources. Just don't join a cult.

Cults are often a mixture of both. It's a common mistake to assume that cults offer no valid spiritual insight. The issue is, spiritual insights via a video or book do not guarantee that the cult isn't a shit-show behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
	Case in point: Osho's commune. Osho was a good teacher but a terrible community leader.
</p>

<p>
	Saying advanced stuff into a camera is very easy compared to running a high consciousness community. Narcissistic cult leaders are often exceptionally good at speaking, bullshitting, and putting up fake fronts. That is their Zone of Genius. So you can't take appearances too seriously. Look at their actions rather than their words.
</p>

<p>
	If the community leader is taking on multiple wives or asking for six figure donations or has a criminal history -- that's a HUGE red flag.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is a set of special physical and energetic techniques for rewiring your nervous system. It is supposed to be much more powerful than meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is a bit like micro-dosing psychedelics.

Engineering work is usually pretty dry and routine.
</p>

<p>
	That's the major reason I switched my major from engineering to philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at more artist careers like creative writing, design, film-making, fine art, etc. That's where you can really flex your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I love the imaginative nature of game design or storytelling.

<p>
	In practice it's hard to help the world when you are underdeveloped and struggling to meet your basic needs.
</p>

<p>
	The point of developing yourself is so that you can become a better tool for helping uplift the world.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't wait to be perfect before you help the world. You can work on both simultaneously. Help out in whichever ways you're able. Don't bite off more than you can chew.
</p>

<p>
	The greatest thing you will ever do for the world is to awaken yourself.

<p>
	That isn't the issue. The issue is, are you capable enough, resourceful enough, to solve the problem of feeding yourself? The food itself is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	If you struggle to feed yourself that is a serious red flag. It shows a lack of development, resourcefulness, discipline, and self-efficacy.

<p>
	Very common.
</p>

<p>
	Do not trust young spiritual leaders to run solid communities. Running a spiritual community requires enormous development, ethics, experience, wisdom, and maturity. Spiritual communities quickly devolve into sex cults if the leader isn't masterful in his self-control, ethics, and emotions.
</p>

<p>
	You can almost guarantee that spiritual communities lead by 20-30 year olds will devolve very quickly. They have no idea the challenges.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment alone is nowhere near enough to run successful spiritual community.

Failure is part of the learning process.
</p>

<p>
	Now you have a bit of a better sense of how difficult it is to pull off a solid meditation retreat. Especially solo. Its takes super-human levels of self-discipline and dedication.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you have to build up to it. Just like you cannot will yourself to bench press 300 lbs. It takes many months of ramping up to that.
</p>

<p>
	The value of something like Kriya yoga is that you can do it for 1hr per day and it will gradually strengthen you over the course of a year in a way which you would never be able to achieve with a week-long hardcore retreat. The reality is that it takes time to rewire the mind and build tolerance for meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you need a lot more daily practice. It also helps a lot to hit a point in your practice where you actually enjoy meditation. It's very hard to pull off a retreat if you're secretly hoping it stops. The key is to surrender to the whole process and try to enjoy the silence, solitude, and peace. But that probably won't happen your first few retreats.
</p>

<p>
	Just keep practicing and doing as much as you can. Remember, it's not all about quantity. The quality of your practice is far more important than quantity. Quantity without quality will not yield much results.
</p>

<p>
	Also be patient. You are young. You don't need to be enlightened tomorrow. It's okay if it takes 5 years of practice. You will still be ahead of everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Precisely because you want to.
</p>

<p>
	Stop holding life purpose as something that NEEDS to be done. It's not about need, it's about desire to play a game.
</p>

<p>
	There's no need for Mario run across the screen and avoid turtle shells. But if you WANT, it can be a fun game. No one is forcing you to play Mario. If you would rather sit in your mother's basement and stare at the wall, go right ahead.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't want to do anything cool with your life, fine. Then be lame.

<p>
	There is no such thing as "a reality". Reality is entangled with one's nervous system. Such that every living creature has a different reality. If there is an infinite number of possible ways to configure a nervous system, there are an infinite number of different realities. For example, in some realities the color red does not exist because of how the nervous system is structured. In other realities it is not possible to know that 5+5=10 because of how the nervous system is structured. For example, a donkey cannot realize that 5+5=10. It cannot have that insight. But a human can. And not all humans. Only those with a proper nervous system. A mentally disabled person cannot realize that 5+5=10.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine all the experiences and insights you are unable to have simply because your nervous system does not grant you access to them. Your nervous system is like a filter through which infinity is boiled down to a narrow limited finite set of experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics alter your nervous system, allowing you to access experiences and insights that would otherwise be impossible. Which is why they're so uniquely useful for metaphysical work.
</p>

<p>
	But independent of all the above, there is the Absolute Truth, which you have access to if you are normal healthy human being.
</p>

	Rather, value is a thought! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	You can use the mind to assign value to whatever, depending on your survival needs. All value is relative.

<p>
	That's better than nothing. Nothing wrong with those. You can strategically use that motivation to build a lot of necessary infrastructure in your life. Then you can move on to higher things.
</p>

<p>
	Do not feel bad about meeting lower survival needs. They are necessary in most cases. You've got to climb Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. If the higher needs don't motivate you just yet that's probably because you're so under-developed in the lower ones.
</p>

<p>
	If you are in your early 20's you need to focus on learning basic survival skills. Learn how to feed yourself independently. Then worry about spirituality. If you are incapable of feeding yourself, you have no hope of attaining enlightenment or other advanced stuff like that.
