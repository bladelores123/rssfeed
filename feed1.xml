<p>
	Yes, such a period in one's life can be stressful and exhausting.
</p>

<p>
	Starting a biz is not easy and eats up a lot of time and energy. But if you do it right, it will pay dividends for the rest of your life.
</p>

<p>
	Starting my own biz was one of the best decisions I ever made, enough though it was challenging and stressful at times.
</p>

<p>
	Just make sure you don't burn yourself out.

<p>
	In practice you probably shouldn't because they will not understand.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to reverse an irrational paranoia. Parents tend to be closedminded about such things, like naive children pretending to be good parents. It's ironic.

That's basically how I expect it to work.
</p>

<p>
	Of course God cannot stay in God mode all the time, otherwise there would be no human birth. At some point God has to choose to forget and re-enter the Matrix.
</p>

<p>
	What should you do? Enjoy your Creation. Be the Creator and all that entails.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's all meaningless in the end. That's what makes it so meaningful!
</p>

<p>
	It's an Infinite Game.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, awakening robs you of a certain innocence. There is a certain bliss to being asleep and clueless. It's fun to play a new video game, getting all excited about acheiving something in it. It's no fun playing a game you yourself designed just like it's no fun watching a magic trick you've deeply studied.

Child with large and overactive amygdala (which he got in a genetic lottery) will build an identity of a fearful person, cause his amygdala fires in social "events". As opposed to a child with small and underactive amygdala who may even have some sociopathic tendencies cause no inhibitions.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Nothing I said denies the genetic base. Obviously a child born with 1 leg and 1 arm will have very different survival obstacles than one who is born "normal". His childhood will be very "problematic" as he has to figure out how to deal with kids laughing at him, girls rejecting him, self-esteem issues, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This actually supports my point: your genetics is really just the original "childhood problem". Whatever your genetics are, you'll be dealing with the fallout of that your whole life. If you are born a woman, that's one kind of genetic problem. If you are born a man, that's another kind of genetic problem. And so on. And of course all of these "genetic problems" become cultural and social problems.
</p>

<p>
	It does not matter what your genetics are, whatever they are, they define the scope of your survival. If you are born a cat, you will be dealing with "cat problems" your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot separate genetic problems from behavioral problems from societal problems from childhood traumas. It's all interconnected.
</p>

<p>
	10g is a reckless dose, and really a waste since it will be too much for you to retain.
</p>

<p>
	Take 2g and contemplate next time.
</p>

<p>
	You could have seriously injured yourself with a 10g dose as a newbie. WTF were you thinking?
</p>

<p>
	Newbies should start with 1g.

	You shouldn't trip on LSD on back to back days. There is at least a week of tolerance.

<p>
	No matter how deeply you explore it, you will always be infinitely far away from reaching the end. No matter how far back in time you go, you will be infinitely far away from finding its beginning. Not because you are too limited as a human, but because a beginning and end simply do not exist.

<p>
	God is endless consciousness.

	Drinking sugar water (Coke) makes you fat. Filling your body with heavily refined stuff like corn syrup is not wise.

	If you're in doubt it ain't a breakthrough. Just gradually up your dose until you get there.

<p>
	Never combine 5-MeO-DMT with MOAI.

<p>
	By big business I mean large corporations that deal with millions of customers.

<p>
	There are certain scales of biz which require very different approaches.
</p>

<p>
	$0 to $1mil
</p>

<p>
	$1mil to $5mil
</p>

<p>
	$5mil to $20mil
</p>

<p>
	$100mil+
</p>

<p>
	Those are very different beasts.
</p>

<p>
	To take your biz from $3mil to $20mil will require radically changing how you do business.

	I didn't start any large corporation, nor did I ever use investors to start my businesses.

<p>
	You just gotta be creative. You can run a small biz and do well.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you'll be working long hours to make your small biz thrive. Then you'll understand why long hours are common.
</p>

<p>
	There exist many opportunities for small businesses. There are many market niches which are too small to sustain large corporations so they can't compete with you.
</p>

<p>
	Business is just like the animal kingdom. The biggest animals are not the only game in town. In fact, most animals are small ones. You can be a highly successful small animal. But you gotta be more creative, clever, and strategic than the big guys.

<title>How the hell did Hegel know about non-dual/buddhist ideas?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/39617-how-the-hell-did-hegel-know-about-non-dualbuddhist-ideas/?do=findComment&amp;comment=496424</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The mistake is assuming Buddhism is somehow original. Buddhism just mirrors reality.
</p>

<p>
	Hegel doesn't need to know about Buddhism, he just need to be conscious of reality.
</p>

<p>
	He was a Christian and he deeply understood Christianity. Not as it's practiced today, but in the old school idealist mystical sense.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that a lot of old philosophers and scientists were more right about metaphysics than scientists are today precisely because they were Christians, and Christianity is grounded in the deepest truth there is. It just happens to also be very corrupt. So the real question is, How did Hegel manage to escape the corruption of Christianity?
</p>

<p>
	Hegel may not have been a meditator in the Buddhist sense, but he was obviously a deep contemplator and closely studied his direct experience. Which is the equivalent of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	He also deeply studied Heraclitus.
</p>

<p>
	When Heraclitus was asked, How did you become enlightened? He replied,
</p>

<p>
	"I studied myself."

<title>Martin Seligman: Childhood has nothing to do with our problems</title>

<p>
	I would actually say just the opposite:
</p>

<p>
	All of your current dysfunctions in life are the result of past events.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so simple as correlating some one horrid childhood event to your current problem. It's much more complex. All problems are the result of whatever the "self" you identify as. This "self" was constructed as a reaction to survival challenges in the past. The "self" is nothing more than a survival mechanism. So of course it's highly conditioned by upbringing, childhood, teenage years, and early adulthood. Whatever stuff happened to you between the ages of 0 to 30 has shaped your personality almost totally to the point where you cannot even know what your self would be without it. Of course your are not just shaped by bad events but good events too.
</p>

<p>
	Of course none of this means you can't change.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bad idea to listen to academic psychologists when it comes to understanding the dynamics of the self. Broad surveys and studies are not gonna cut it here. This requires existential level insight through direct work on oneself.
</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself where your "self" came from? You'll see it was from the past. In fact, your entire mind came from the past. Every word you use came from your past. 99% of the ideas in your mind came from your past. You hardly invented anything new. You are like a snowball rolling down hill collecting more snow and dirt.
</p>

<p>
	But the strange looping twist here is, the past is just a figment of your mind! There never was a past or a self or a world! You made it all up. You sneaky devil, you.
</p>

<p>
	Survival has everything to do with your problems. Without survival there is no problem at all.
</p>

<title>How Racism Works</title>

It basically is whatever we say it is.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel courageous you can post your pic on:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://hotornot.com/" rel="external nofollow">https://hotornot.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	And they will rate you from 0-10.
</p>

<p>
	But it would really be better for your self-esteem not to submit yourself to such mob evaluation of your self-worth. In the end you gotta love your genetics however they happen to be. Can't change that (yet).
</p>

<p>
	You must play with the hand life has dealt you.
</p>

<p>
	If it's of any consolation, all the "hot" people will eventually become not. So this is a bullet you'll have to bite at one point or another in life. You can't really avoid it. It's just a matter of time. It's a good idea not to base your self-esteem or happiness on your physical appearance. Or else you'll be in for a world of hurt.
</p>

<p>
	The great news is, you are not a physical being at all.
</p>

<p>
	On a practical level sleeping with lots of women is just unsustainable for many reasons. In the end you'll find it takes up way too much time and energy which could be put to better use.

<p>
	Indeed. If you were wise you'd see that happiness is all that matters and therefore fucking as many hot women as possible would cease to interest you. But as of now you're still to unconscious, immature, and needy to realize this.
</p>

<p>
	Your attachment is to your dick. So you're very much attached here.
</p>

<p>
	If you really wanted to be detached you'd give up sex altogether and never think of it again. This would be the wise move. But of course you're too unconscious to pull it off.

	It's not a matter of morality. It's just foolish, immature, and self-defeating.
</p>

<p>
	You are thinking with your dick. Which is not way of the sage.
</p>

<p>
	By all means, think with your dick as much as you want. But don't expect that to go well.

<p>
	The less you think with your dick, the better your life will go, the happier you'll be.

<p>
	That's because "hot" is literally defined by that which is in the top 5%.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not that most women are not hot. It's that what's hot is the top 5% of whatever is.
</p>

<p>
	If women were donkeys, you'd still be like, "These donkeys suck. I want a better donkey."
</p>

<p>
	That's survival. Always looking for the most you can get for the least amount of effort.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course corporations are a source of government corruption and rig the laws to serve their survival.
</p>

<p>
	But the problem is far deeper than that. Complex technology and massive scales of life (human society in the 100s of millions) requires massive infrastructure and collective forms of organization. We cannot just go back to living in little tribes in some hippie eco-village. The whole challenge here is that individual humans are not the end-all-be-all of life. Life has surpassed humans to include corporations, organizations, religions, social movements, cultures, governments, nations, and beyond. Massive complexity and bureaucracy is necessary to sustain things like nuclear weapons, gasoline cars, airports, highways, currency, the internet, GPS satellites, regulation of pollution & deforestation, regulation of endangered species, modern medicine, modern food, modern electronics, etc.
</p>

<p>
	None of that could exist without corporations or giant bureaucracies.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot build a modern home by yourself, or even with a small group of your friends. Modern housing construction requires sophisticated supply chains, regulation, infrastructure, factories, shipping containers, airports, railroad, power plants, mining, logging, and a thousand other things.
</p>

<p>
	Starbucks does better than a family owned coffee shop precisely because it solves complex organizational problems like supply chain issues, warehousing, etc. and it delivers a very reliable, high-quality product which people love.
</p>

<p>
	You must always take into account the problem of scale. Scale! Scale! Scale! is what people underestimate. It's very easy to run a small coffee shop that serves 100 customers. It's a whole nother design challenge to serve good coffee consistently to 1 billion customers. What worked at the scale of 100 does not work at the scale of 1 billion. It's a whole new creature. And we live in a world were business is done in the billions, not in the thousands. If business is not done in the billions, say goodbye to your car, your TV, your house, your phone, your computer, your internet, your video games, your fave TV shows, your GPS, your vacations, your books, etc.

</p>

<p>
	The way to solve that problem is reducing the incentives to milk.
</p>

<p>
	Passive income is not needed to escape wage slavery. Passive income is what causes wage slavery.
</p>

<p>
	In the future everyone will have to generate creative value or not get paid.
</p>

<p>
	Income should be tied to how much creative value you can generate. Being a landlord is not adding significant creative value to society. You're just basically taking advantage of the fact that you have more money than others to earn even more money. Which is like standing on someone's shoulders while kicking them in the teeth.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone has creativity. Don't give me that excuse. It is your job in life to actualize your creativity rather than becoming a parasite.

<p>
	If income from real eatate that you didn't live in was taxed highly, people would be much less incentivized to invest in it. Investing only works if there is a good ROI. So eating into that ROI will work nicely.
</p>

<p>
	Same with capital gains tax and passive income tax.

<title>Public housing option - Why not build &quot;commie blocks&quot; all over the USA?</title>

<p>
	There are some things government would not be good for, and I think housing might be one of them.
</p>

<p>
	There is enormous range in quality of housing and it all depends on location, build quality, management, and even the type of people who live in it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see how the government could realistically level the real eatate market. The market is too big and too wide. Prime land is super expensive. You can't just make it cheap or seize it from people who already own it.
</p>

<p>
	I think a better solution for this is UBI plus high taxes on real estate which is not lived in by the owner. There needs to be serious taxation and regulation of real eatate speculation to cut down on over-priced real estate. But NY and California will always be expensive places to live.
</p>

<p>
	I think housing development is best handled by private local companies because it is such a geographically specific thing.
</p>

<title>450ug AL-LAD Trip Report - Confusion</title>

<p>
	Hehehe... this is typical.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta lower your doses and contemplate reality on your trips a lot more. Do this over and over again on low doses (125ug) until you gain a deeper understanding of what consciousness is. Then you up your doses a bit.
</p>

<p>
	It takes 20, 50, 70 trips to start to make sense of how psychedelics work.
</p>

<p>
	1 or 2 trips is not nearly enough and there will be a lot of confusion at first because you have no idea yet how crazy powerful consciousness is.
</p>

<p>
	You can't turn to anyone for help with this because all humans are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, at times you will feel like you've totally lost your mind and gone completely insane. And yet you will be closer to Truth than ever in those moments. Don't doubt the trips. Doubt your sober state.
</p>

It's merely intellectual. You're not actually conscious of what Love is.
</p>

<p>
	It would be better for you to just admit you don't know what love is or why it is. You have some ideas, but they are just ideas.

	Yeah, if you wanna bang hot girls you're gonna have competition. Welcome to the jungle.

<p>
	You really expect hot girls for free?
</p>

<p>
	You are way too entitled. Attracting hot girls is a lot of work, and it must be that way because hot girls are valuable & rare.

	So either lower your standards or up your effort.

	Yeah, drop your desire for promiscuity.

<p>
	It's like you're asking us:
</p>

<p>
	How do I reconcile my desire to be healthy and fit with my desire for eating whatever garbage I feel like in any quantity?
</p>

<p>
	When you get serious about being healthy you will surrender your desire for junk food.

<title>How to get $180 000 for my Life Purpose Study</title>

<p>
	What most people don't realize is that earning $180k is not much easier than earning $5 million.
</p>

<p>
	To even create a business that sustainably earns $20k per year is not easy, and it will involve as much work as a business that earns a lot more. The money is the not main factor.
</p>

<p>
	You can't make a baby is 3 months just by wanting a small baby. There is a certain minimum that goes into building any sustainable brand. And it usually takes years at least.
</p>

<p>
	Chasing after schemes to make cash is not a good idea. If you're serious about making money you need to start a serious business. For that you should plan to invest 3-5 years of your life, full-time, at least.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot turn financial freedom into a formula. That will never work.
</p>

<p>
	You are talking about how to start a business. And business is all about creating a unique brand and niche, and adding massive value to people's lives.
</p>

<p>
	I have several videos about this:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Small Business Advice
	</li>
	<li>
		How To Escape Wage Slavery
	</li>
	<li>
		and my Life Purpose Course
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Of course this is only general advice. I don't teach business or marketing skills.

<p>
	That's right. God is absolute self-acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness cannot help but accept itself because it has no other option. To deny oneness requires a limited, dualistic consciousness which divides self into other.
</p>

<p>
	God loves you because God is you. God has no other to it, so it loves and accepts all. God is indiscriminate consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Indiscriminate consciousness is your true nature. That is enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12860-consilience/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="12860" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12860-consilience/" rel="">@Consilience</a> You are doing good, but you still have yet to realize Love / Absolute Self-Acceptance as your true nature. This is a very radical mystical state of consciousness. You could equate it to death, immortality, or total God-mode. It will be so epic your whole body will shudder in a cosmic orgasm. Keep following the scent trail and maybe one day you'll reach it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot with this.

<p>
	You are misunderstanding Infinity. It doesn't mean what you think it means.
</p>

<p>
	You are never going to figure this out using logic, as you are trying to do.
</p>

<p>
	All of your logic is dualistic and relative.
</p>

<p>
	You can say "1+1=2 is absolute" or "we don't know", but all of that is a relative construction of the ego-mind.
</p>

<title>misrepresentation of buddhist heart awakening in last video, what is love 2</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/39556-misrepresentation-of-buddhist-heart-awakening-in-last-video-what-is-love-2/?do=findComment&amp;comment=495701</link>

<p>
	There is no such thing as Buddhism. There is Buddhism as interpreted by a mind. Buddhism is often taught in dogmatic ways or misinterpreted by the unawakened mind.
</p>

<p>
	There have been plenty of people on this forum (even some who claim to be awake) who deny the existential nature of Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not merely a heart awakening. Love = Truth, and many people are denial about that because they simply have not become conscious enough to realize that facet of God.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening goes much deeper than people realize. There is so much depth and so many facets of it that they are easy to miss. Many people fool themselves into thinking they have seen it all. And they refuse to listen when they are told they are missing some important facet.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter what the scriptures say because most people don't read them, or read them yet misunderstand them, or read them but never have direct consciousness of what they point to. Scriptures tend to be dry and fall on deaf ears.
</p>

<p>
	Dogmatic Buddhism is a common thing. There are a thousand times more Buddhists than awakened people. So all this is to be expected.
</p>

<p>
	What I teach, and Buddhism, are not the same thing. There are important differences even though the general direction is similar.
</p>

I'm not sure if it will dissolve in that, but DMSO (Dimethylsulfoxide) is usually used as a solvent to allow something to be absorbed through the skin. You mentioned that DPT doesn't really dissolve in water. DMSO may need to be diluted. I read to make sure everything is clean because it can carry dirt into the body too.

<p>
	There's no need.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter if it doesn't dissolve in the water. It will still absorb just fine. Just suck it up into the oral syringe. The particles of DPT will be suspended in the water.

<p>
	Probably. Do some online research of what people snort.
</p>

<p>
	I find snorting and plugging dosages to be similar potency for psychedelics in general. You should never compare oral dosages to snorting or plugging because they are totally different.

But lower your dosages. It can be intense.

<p>
	For some people plugging doesn't work. Probably a genetic thing.

</p>

<p>
	Maybe there is a deeper reason why you avoid truth. Maybe truth won't fit your fantasies of growth.

<p>
	But his base is not enough to win.
</p>

<p>
	The beauty of Trump is that his base cannot grow and he only knows how to rile them up. He doesn't know how to play moderate.

<p>
	It's interesting that when Steve Bannon was asked internally about Trump winning in 2020, he didn't even consider it a possibility.
</p>

<p>
	Internally they know Trump is fucked. His numbers are just terrible and he's not gonna be able to spin his way out of that the hole he's dug for himself. The media is not doing a good job of reporting on Trump's terrible record-low numbers. They keep acting as if Trump is a normal president with normal popular support. This is not the case. Trump is the most unpopular president of all time.
