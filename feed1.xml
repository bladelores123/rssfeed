<p>
	That is one of the problems.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically you'd need some kind of grain substitute like rice. But eating grain makes me feel bad because it's high in carbs and causes a sugar crash. It not particularly healthy either.
</p>

<p>
	Grain is basically empty sugar calories.
</p>

<p>
	Potatoes are one option. But again, it's mostly empty sugar calories.
</p>

<p>
	My body feels best on a diet of meat, veggies, fruits, and quality fats. Low carbs as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Juicing fruit and veggies is great for health. But you can't rely on it to keep you full.
</p>

<title>Sports as a Spiritual Pursuit</title>

<p>
	The practical problem is that with professional sports your body can give out at any time and ruin your entire LP. And this happens all too often.
</p>

<p>
	If by sports you mean coaching others, of course that's more practical. But then again, what is really the point of competitive sports? It's rather mindless. I guess I have a bias against it. It just doesn't make sense to me to devote your life to throwing balls into baskets. But hey, it's your life. Do WTF you want.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Do you actually create them? Or do you just re-sell them? That's a big difference.
</p>

<p>
	There can be all kinds of interesting business opportunities in creating innovative new types of homes. But this has little to do with real-estate. This is more of a technology and design challenge.
</p>

<p>
	The reason real-estate re-selling is so competitive is because there's no creative value in it. You're adding very little to society by flipping properties. It's basically just an easy way to make money so every fool wants in. Do something that requires more skill, more art, more design, more intelligence.

	Commercialization of psychedelics is a problem that won't exist for many decades to come. Let's worry about that problem if and when it becomes a thing.

<p>
	Basically all healthy food you have to make yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Ain't no one gonna prepare for you organic food using high quality ingredients.

	Personally it doesn't work for me because it doesn't give be enough energy.
</p>

<p>
	For other people it works.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that people have different body types and different genetics which correspond to your ancestor's diet.

<title>How honest can you be?</title>

<p>
	There's nothing honest about that. Plenty of people care.
</p>

<p>
	Counselors are supposed to be trained to handle situations like that. This is what basic life coach training is for.
</p>

<p>
	Being gay is a great thing and there's nothing depressing about it. A good counselor would help her client reframe the situation and see it in a loving and truthful manner.
</p>

<p>
	If a client hates himself, that's not honest or truthful, that's falsehood and delusion. The coach's job is to show him the error of his thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like your counselor friend needs better training and a deeper understanding of consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	Many counselors and coaches deeply care about their clients.
</p>

<p>
	How you reply to such a thing is you guide the client's mind out of his delusional thinking by getting him to become more conscious of how his mind is creating this negative meaning. It's not about saying something positive to cheer him up. It's about helping him discover the Truth! -- which is that all is Love.
</p>

<p>
	Self-hatred is a misuse of the mind.
</p>

<title>Chilean Dictatorship red blue or orange?</title>

<p>
	Red/Blue
</p>

<p>
	All of South America (especially back in the 20th century) was not yet at solid Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, it's easy to tap a bit into a higher stage like Orange. It's a lot harder to become solid in that stage. South America is still deeply Blue. They got a lot of work to do to reach solid Orange.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful to distinguish pockets of Orange in elite neighborhoods within developed cities vs the bulk of the country, which is rural, poor, or underdeveloped. The stage of a country cannot be judged by its peak elite neighborhoods in its biggest cities. You need to take a representative sample all around the country. It's too easy to cherrypick a few advanced neighborhoods while the rest of the country is an underdeveloped swamp.
</p>

<p>
	Beverly Hills, San Francisco, and NYC are not an accurate measure of the development level of average Americans.
</p>

<p>
	Since Truth and Love are identical and absolute, of course they are for their own sake.
</p>

<p>
	What are you gonna do, pursue Truth & Love for the sake of money, sex, or fame? That makes no sense. Truth & Love are superior to all the above because they transcend and include all the above. Once you have Truth & Love there's nothing else left for you to want. All wanting is a lack of Truth & Love.

	Bhakti yoga is one specific path. There are many paths to God & Love. It's not exclusive to Bhakti yoga. Follow whichever path resonates with you most.

He already desires it. I merely told him to not be lazy about his desire.
</p>

<p>
	If he wants to drop the desire, by all means, go right ahead and drop it. But does he really want to drop it?
</p>

<p>
	Either desire a thing and pursue it, or do not. If you waffle in the middle, expect hell.
</p>

<p>
	A common trap of this work is to get so metaphysical and existential as to avoid following through on the basics of human life. It's pretty simple really, if you're a human, you want to fuck. Best to embrace that rather than deny it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like people pretending that they are above sex when they really aren't. You are only above sex when you genuinely no longer desire it.
</p>

<title>Notice the shift from the Obama era?</title>

<p>
	To the contrary, the rise of Trump has pushed America and Democrats much more left.
</p>

<p>
	Obama was pretty centrist and things like Medicare For All, Green New Deal, and rejection of corporate money was unthinkable 5-10 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	America is steadily moving left-er. Which is precisely what Trumpism is a reaction against. The core fuel behind Trumpism is that America is moving left and they cannot stand to admit that this is the correct direction to go, so they act like stubborn jackasses. The jackassery makes them feel morally righteous and avoid admitting deep flaws in their worldview.
</p>

<p>
	It all revolves around not wanting to change one's worldview due to it supporting a fictitious identity.
</p>

<p>
	Never forget, in the long-run things are always getting better, moving towards more consciousness, unity, and love. The evil which sprouts up along the way is part of the ulitmate flowering of Love.
</p>

<p>
	Brexit is the analog of Trump's boarder wall with a mote with snakes and crocodiles.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that both moves are a fear-based contraction of consciousness and will come with accompanying karma.
</p>

<p>
	It's the political equivalent of shitting where you eat.

<p>
	As the Buddha wisely pointed out 2500 years ago, all desire leads to suffering.
</p>

<p>
	This problem is much broader than you realize.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, stop being lazy and go get a date.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing worse than desire is a desire that you are lazy about.

	You don't need to spend 50 years doing witchcraft. It would be wise to read a few books about it just so you understand what witchcraft is. You don't even know what the practice of witchcraft entails. You are rejecting something you haven't even researched for 5 hours.
</p>

<p>
	If you were serious about understanding reality you would be curious: "Why do people practice witchcraft? What does it get them?" This line of inquiry would yield some good fruit. But you haven't done it.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you will have to makeÂ educated guesses as to where to look.
</p>

<p>
	But what you absolutely must understand is that your guesses are biased, circular, and often wrong.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be willing to admit your wrongness, bias, and circularity to yourself.
</p>

<title>What if there is No Truth to Discover and Enlightenment Does Not exist?</title>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is not a concept and cannot ever be communicated.
</p>

<p>
	You do not know if what the Buddhists say is true. Lots of people say lots of stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You must discover Truth for yourself, without reliance on any human sources or language.
</p>

<p>
	It is NOT safe to assume that Truth can be written down or even thought.

	You don't know what the Truth is. But it is possible to know.

	Some things can only be learned the hard way.
</p>

<p>
	A closed mind cannot be changed until it decides to open up by suffering the consequences of its closedness.
</p>

<p>
	Convincing a girl to leave a guy who's not right for her is like trying to discuss Greek philosophy with a mule. None of your logic matters.

<title>The Strict Rationalist's Justification for Nondualism &amp; Philosophical Implications</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/41418-the-strict-rationalists-justification-for-nondualism-philosophical-implications/?do=findComment&amp;comment=516853</link>

<p>
	You're welcome to play such philosophical games all you want. But Truth does not depend on any kind of justification. All of your justifications come after the fact.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Truth does not contradict rationality per se. But it sure does transcend it.
</p>

<p>
	"The supreme function of reason is to show man that some things are beyond reason." -- Blaise Pascal
</p>

<p>
	All of your reason and induction is indirect. Truth is prior to all that. Truth is even prior to perception. Reason is going to slow you down from reaching Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that your problem is that you don't want to let reason go. Ironically, you are irrationally attached to reason. So what's the solution? Let it go! Just let it go.
</p>

	If you camp out near the beach in Hawaii that can be basically free.
</p>

<p>
	Food is pricey in Hawaii though. But if you wanted to go real cheap you could live off rice/bread/junk food.
</p>

<p>
	Tickets to Hawaii cost $800-$1000 from West Coast.

Forget the lofty metaphysical stuff for now, and enough watching theory. Now it's implementation time.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately there can be no shortcut for doing your pushups. You just gotta bite the bullet amd start doing them, one baby step at a time. Gradually build up your momentum.
</p>

<p>
	Yew, this work takes lots of work. Accomplishing your highest vision requires a lot of hustling.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe see my video: How To Get Shit Done. You have to be results oriented, not just theortical.
</p>

<p>
	Also see my video: Balancing Theory vs Practice.
</p>

<p>
	You are stuck in a cycle of avoiding emotional labor and there's just no advice that can let you skirt that. You cannot grow up and become successful without emotional labor.

<p>
	Game companies have gotten a lot greedier and more exploitativeÂ in the last ten years. Few games are made for the artistry any more.
</p>

<p>
	Of course indie gaming has also taken off in the last 10 years, which was great!
</p>

<p>
	Online distribution has allowed for more exploitation. With great power comes great responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	Companies like EA, Activision, Ubisoft, BioWare, Bungie, Blizzard, and Bethesda have sold their soul to the devil because they became too successful for their own good. The money corrupted the art and they will never produce the same kind of great art they once did.
</p>

<p>
	Look to small, new companies for art. You are not going to find art at McDonalds.

<p>
	Yes, I have removed about 20-30 books which over time I felt didn't meet my quality standards. I replaced those books with better books.
</p>

	Quality is more important than quantity in this case. There are far too many books around which will waste your time.

<p>
	As I become more conscious my quality standards rise and I'm less tolerant of low-consciousness books.

	Obviously he wasn't anywhere near awakened, but his heart was in the right place and he was drawn intuitively towards Love, which resulted in his entire career and sense of life purpose. He's a great example of someone boldly following their LP.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people following their LP intuitively simply because it feels right, without an deeper existential understanding of why they're doing it. That's a fine way to get started. Later, existential understanding and consciousness work can be added on top of that to take your LP to crazy levels.

<p>
	No, it's deeper than that. The entire self/other distinction is imaginary. There is no one in the universe but yourself. By this I mean, you are the entire universe and all "others". Universal Mind imagines your body and all other bodies into existence.

			The problem is the skeptic will claim that even after taking the psychedelic and being convinced of whatever mystical truth he might simply have been tricked due to the limitations of his brain. He might say that once he has the mystical experience he will be utterly convinced of it, which is why he must avoid it to stay objective.

<p>
	Yes, of course. This is an example of paradigm lock. Since you are God, if you take your own ideas seriously enough, you will get stuck in your mind until you die.
</p>

<p>
	So the solution to this kind of skepticism is death.
</p>

<p>
	There are a million different ways the mind can lock itself into an ideology from which it cannot escape other than through physical death. No amount of reason will solve this problem because reason itself is the problem.

			A skeptic might ask:
		</p>

		<p>
			How do we not know that all spiritual revelations are not simply the mind truly coming to terms with, or becoming conscious of, it's private nature?
		</p>

		<p>
			How do we know that it is not simply the mind truly embracing and recognizing it's isolation, it's disconnectedness from anything that was presumed to be outside of it?
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, the skeptic would state that the brain itself simply recognizes that all there is is brain. That all brain has encountered was always fundamentally the brain. That all the brain encounters is fundamentally produced or imagined by the brain.
		</p>

		<p>
			Would the skeptic not find it peculiar that the statements coming from non-dual masters very much resemble what we would predict such a brain to state if it truly were to become conscious of it's isolation, of the privacy of it's own reality?
		</p>

		<p>
			Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			The skeptic could simply buy into naive realism. The skeptic could say that some imaginations of the brain actually correlate with what the outside of brain is, like for example the model of the brain. He might argue that the more sophisticated the understanding of that materialistic framework is the more truly it will correlate to what exists outside of brain. That way he might be able to avoid the self-referential problem and could reduce all mystical experiences merely as brain states.
		</p>

		<p>
			After all, he could object, would any experience that represented the totality of the brain actually be total, it would be Absolute. The private reality of the brain becoming conscious of itself would by definition from the perspective of that brain be Absolute, Infinite, all encompassing.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's right. Nothing stops the mind from deluding itself by adopting an ideology like skepticism.
</p>

<p>
	The key question is: How do you know skepticism is valid? You don't.
</p>

<p>
	Apply skepticism to your skepticism until you realize that skepticism eats its own tail. And where does that leave you?
</p>

<p>
	If you were a true skeptic you would have to surrender your skepticism on the grounds that you cannot tell if it is true or false. By advancing skepticism, you hold that skepticism is true, which is false. On the other hand, if you hold that skepticism is false, that is also false.
</p>

<p>
	So you're fucked either way because the mind cannot grasp Truth. Your mistake was assuming that mind can grasp Truth. Be more skeptical about that assumption.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Both. There are multiple forces at work. You have an innate attraction to consciousness and love because those are you truest nature and deep down you feel it. But also the ego-mind likes the idea of all the material spiritual benefits and status it will receive for reaching enlightenment. The ego-mind loves the idea of being special and unique and better than everyone else, so of course enlightenment sounds great in that respect. But that's only because the ego-mind doesn't really understand what enlightenment means until its too late.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are right. Since you are God and you are One, you cannot ever fully escape yourself. Consciousness will always eventually awaken to itself, it's just a question of time. What pulls you to God is simply the fact that you are God! What's amazing is not that God is pulled towards itself but how God lost itself in the first place. All evolution and life is the process of God pulling itself towards itself, realizing and actualizing itself.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is beyond normative, it is absolutely mandatory and inevitable. Awakening is Absolute Truth. You don't have to awaken as this human lifetime, but eventually you will awaken no matter what because you are Infinite Consciousness and there is nowhere you can escape to from yourself because you exist in all places.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually EVERYONE gets it. Just not within this short human life you know. You have to remember that God's time horizon is infinite while the human time horizon is 100 years. That's a huge gap! Stop looking at life through the human filter of 100 years. Look at life as it would look if you had 100 trillion years to live across 100 trillion lifetimes across 100 trillion different lifeforms across 100 trillion different universes.

			I've watched your post calledÂ <em>A Taste Of Infinity</em>Â on your blog, and there are some things that I don't get.
		</p>

		<p>
			If this universe is in the world of the form, hence finite, how could a fractal be zoomed to infinity? In theory you can, but in practice the video will end. The process in your computer that does the zooming will end at some point. Even if there was a way to zoom the fractal until the end of the universe (I'm assuming there will be an end, because if something begins my intuition tells me it will end), there will be a time when the zooming will end. And you wrote:
		</p>

		<p>
			It's like saying that the number pi is infinite in theory, and can be proved mathematically that it's infinite, but you can't calculate or write all numbers to infinity.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is a critique fromÂ Stage Yellow.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now you'll say that theory and practice is a duality, so it's illusory. And I get it, but sometimes my mind drags me down to question things that my intuition already proved right.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You ask some good questions.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is a very tricky beast. It does not work like ordinary finite things that we're used to dealing with.
</p>

<p>
	By definition, infinity is endless and so you must grok that an infinite thing cannot ever be made fully explicit. So in the case of the fractal it is infinite, but what you're noticing is that it cannot be make fully explicit because in practice the computer will run out of finite memory. This occurs because a finite object (like computer memory) cannot ever encapsulate infinity. No part of reality can ever capture the sum total of reality. It's as if you're trying to fit a large box into a small box. Of course you will always fail. Infinity is a singular object with no other in existence, and it includes all other objects in existence inside itself, since there is nothing but infinity and everything is it, including all finite things.
</p>

<p>
	Fractals are really no different than numbers. How do you know numbers are infinite even though, by definition, no human has ever nor will ever count up all the numbers? Numbers are endless, yet nonetheless your mind is intuitive enough to grasp this as true. Really ask yourself, how is it possible that you understand that numbers are endless enough though you have never reached their end? You might say it's just a theory that numbers are endless, but this isn't correct. It's more than just a theory. Your mind can actually grok the infinitude of numbers, not as theory, but as truth.
</p>

<p>
	You are placing an incorrect and naive expectation on infinity: that it be fully explicated in order to be "truly" infinite. But this is precisely wrong! True infinity is pure potential and formlessness. It cannot ever be explicated. Infinity is an implicit thing. No matter how much you explicate, unravel, or actualize infinity, you will be as far from the end as before you began. That is just the paradoxical nature of infinity. It is endless no matter what you do.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity cannot be grasped with the rational mind because the rational mind is finite while infinity is infinite. You can only understand infinity through a hyper-intuitive function of the mind. Intuition is implicit while rationality is explicit. But as we said above, infinity cannot ever be made fully explicit. So the mistake that rational and scientific people make is they demand infinity to be made fully explicit otherwise they believe it cannot be real. But of course this demand turns out to be misguided. You must change your mind to fit infinity. Don't expect infinity to change itself to fit your limited mind.
</p>

<p>
	More over, yes, the duality between infinity and finity must ultimately collapse into Absolute Unity. Hence the infinite and finite are really identical. Unless you imagine they aren't, in which case you create the world of duality to which you are then a prisoner. You become a prisoner of your own finite, dualistic mind. Until such time that you wake up and realize Absolute Unity.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely not! It will mindfuck you so hard you won't remember your name.
</p>

<p>
	Start with one of the classic psychedelics at low doses.

<p>
	In practice the peak of an LSD trip only lasts up to 6 hours. After the 6 hour mark you will exit deep tripping territory and remain in the after-effects zone with a long gradual tail.
</p>

<p>
	For LSD you definitely gotta take the entire day off and start your trip pretty much as soon as you wake up that day.
</p>

<p>
	For deep tripping, just sit still in a room and contemplate reality. There's no need to go anywhere or do anything. Staring at the carpet is basically good enough. You shouldn't be left disappointed.
</p>

	My brother found himself a wife on OkCupid. They have been happily married for several years.
</p>

<p>
	So don't poo-poo online dating per se. It does work. You just gotta be careful (as with offline dating).

<p>
	If you are serious about being a successful musician it cannot be done for the sake of money and sex. Your motivation must be creative and artistic. The point of making art is never the sex, success, money, or fame, but the joy of creating the art and sharing it with the world.
</p>

<p>
	Your band needs to gets its priorities straight or you need to find a new band.
</p>

<p>
	If they don't fix their priorities ASAP they will never reach success or fame, so don't worry about missing out. You're actually missing out by following them blindly to the dark side. You're literally choosing to sell your soul to the devil for fame. And the devil won't even fulfill his end of that bargain. So you'll end up with nothing.
</p>

<p>
	By leaving the band and restarting under proper values and priorities -- that's your best chance at success. There cannot be good art without integrity and creative vision. You are putting the cart before the horse here. The rewards for your art should matter a lot less to you than the process of making the art itself.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful about chasing get rich quick schemes. Those usually never pan out. If you want success, you must ground it in something solid that offers massive value to the world. You need an attitude of giving rather than taking.
</p>

<p>
	Solid success in music requires years of serious dedication to your craft. You should be so obsessed with making great music that you don't even have time to think about sex. Making great art is more rewarding than sex. But for this you need to be genuine artist, not some hack.
</p>

Obviously lots of guys online will only want to use you for sex and never see you again. You gotta test the waters more before you dive in. Get to know his intentions and his character.

	Careful. Lots of creepy fucks online. Don't just randomly sleep with them.

<p>
	A depressed/anxious dude on a first date is clearly a red flag. He should be happy and excited.

<p>
	1) Fundamentalist Christians indoctrinate children into their ideology under the belief that they are saving the children from evil. Yet they are doing just the opposite, training their children to be dogmatic, making it almost impossible for them to ever discover Truth, God, or Love.
</p>

<p>
	2) The invasion of Iraq under the premise of removing an evil dictator, saving lives, and ending terrorism ended up killing hundreds of thousands of civilians, creating ISIS, and turning Iraq into a breeding ground for terrorism when actually Saddam Hussein would have never allowed for terrorists to flourish in Iraq.
</p>

<p>
	This list could be endless. Basically all evil is done in the name of goodness, love, and truth.

	You're holding that devilry is some material fact of the world which needs to be abolished. That is not the case. Devilry is a relative matter of perspective. You cannot eliminate devilry in the world any more than you can remove a smudge off the surface of the moon when the smudge is on your telescope lens. You've mistaken a smudge on your lens for a feature of the moon. So you'll always fail until you realize that smudge in on your lens, not the moon.
</p>

<p>
	Devilry isn't real. It does not actually exist. It's just a figure of speech and an illusion as the result of the game of survival.

	To get good with girls at any cost.
</p>

<p>
	When you're trying to solve a serious life challenging, it's a good idea to approach it with the attitude of "at any cost". Do not think about the cost of things you really want. Just work five times harder to pay it. Some things in life have absurdly high costs which almost no one is willing to pay. This allows you to set yourself apart from your competition simply by being willing to pay that cost.
</p>

<p>
	You won't really appreciate a thing unless you work your ass off for it.

Your life hinges on you imagining you're a point and not being able to unimagine it.
</p>

<p>
	So what you're unwittingly asking for is for death. What you're really asking is, "Why can't I get myself to die?" And the answer is, because you're too scared and too attached to living.
</p>

<p>
	For your own safety you don't know how to undo imagining your birth. Do you really want to unimagine your own birth? Do you understand how serious that is?
</p>

<p>
	That's right. Evolution progresses to maximize consciousness and love.
</p>

<p>
	But good luck explaining that to a materialist, hehe.
</p>

<p>
	But what do you think life has been doingÂ for the last 2 billion years?

<p>
	One way I found that works is live apart and see each other fairly rarely.
</p>

<p>
	If you're having sex every week it's gonna get stale eventually.

<p>
	Great!
</p>

<p>
	Keep a positive attitude. The first girl my brother approached at a book store coffee shop ended up going on a date with him.
</p>

<p>
	Took me 400+

	That was Absolute Consciousness. That was as real as it gets.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you realized was the highest truth. But it's too much for you to handle in one trip. You will needdozens of trips to make sense of it all. There are still facets you're missing and things go even deeper.
</p>

<p>
	Keep tripping and asking questions and one day you will understand why you created all this: LOVE!

In your latest video, you said the strength of a country is directly proportion to how good its justice system is. Well, the internet is like the wild west right now, and we are forming entire identities around online use. We don't even own our own data, it's being sold for millions. This is BAD!Â

			Andrew Yang has a policy proposal to give each person the rights to their data, which they can sell, only if they choose, to corporations or government. What are your thoughts on this, and how else do you see regulation and consumer protection of the internet shaking out?

You're wasting your time here defending an ideology.

<p>
	Notice that you are just acting like a robot, parroting ideas where programmed into your mind.
