<title>How can Sadhguru initiate so many people into a non-dual experience at once?</title>

<p>
	Pentacostals and evangelicals do group spiritual experiences too. Clearly it works to some degree. But will it really make you deeply enlightened? That's the real question. Or will it make you worship Sadhguru?
</p>

<p>
	Take some mushrooms and you don't need Sadhguru or any guru.

<title>Are rural areas more conducive to spirituality?</title>

<p>
	The key is not the small town itself, the key is being out in nature. Nature is conducive to spirituality as it is uncorrupted by the stench of ego.

<title>I don't want to put off spirituality to handle financial freedom</title>

<p>
	There is not one strategy, there are many
</p>

<p>
	You could focus on gaining financial security first and then go hog-wild on spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could do just the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	It really depends on what your heart wants and what you can handle. It can be very painful to force yourself to work on mundane financial stuff when you are itching to be creative or spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, if your financial situation collapses, that might force you into slave labor and out of your spiritual quest. Again, depending on who you are.
</p>

<p>
	The most spiritually gifted people will never be stopped by financial concerns. But that's not most people. You have to be realistic about what you're gonna be able to handle.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the most direct path to the highest human life, drop everything and go balls deep into spirituality. But that's very hardcore and too difficult for most people to pull off. Most people won't be able to handle it. Hence there are more gradual approaches.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I focused on locking in financial freedom first. But it was pretty painful, to be honest. I would not wish that kind of pain on anyone. But it sure beats being a wage slave.
</p>

<p>
	It is easier to get enlightened out in nature than in a busy building full of people. There's a reason yogis meditate up in the mountains and forests. Nature has a tranquilizing effect on the mind.
</p>

<p>
	But don't make this an excuse. You can practice spirituality anywhere.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with rural areas is that the people there will be more closeminded and rednecky. Don't go telling them you're God, or they might hang you. City-folk are more tolerant and open, but more lost in the materialist race rat.
</p>

<title>No motivation for life purpose!!!?</title>

<p>
	You're missing the bigger picture. Your understanding of what life purpose is is far too small. Life purpose is not a materialistic thing, life purpose is the highest spiritual thing! Your spiritual love IS the source of your life purpose. Stop pitting spirituality and LP against each other.
</p>

<p>
	You just need to upgrade your LP to reflect your new spiritual values and orientation.
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose is an expression of your soul. It has nothing to do with money or career per se.
</p>

<p>
	How is your new spiritual awareness going to impact the world??? You're not here to sit around listening to birds chirp for 60 years. You are here to be a creator. What do you want to create?
</p>

<title>Guy Has Commitment Issues</title>

<p>
	This sounds like every man on Earth! Fear of commitment and intimacy.
</p>

<p>
	If he's not willing to give you the proper relationship you want, then move on to someone else. Trying to force a fit is going to turn out badly for both of you. You can't force a mule to drink water. He has to want it.
</p>

<p>
	You need to own your agenda more. Be clear with yourself and with him what you want. If this scares him off, then it was never going to work anyway. If he was really into you and was serious about relating with another human being, he shouldn't be scared off.
</p>

<p>
	You can't fix men. You gotta find a man who already shares your values. One of your values is relationship while it sounds like that's not one of his values.
</p>

<p>
	You need to decide for yourself, not against yourself. Don't bend over backwards for him. He needs to be clear about what he wants out of this. Relationship requires a conscious decision. Both parties have to be willing to invest time and energy into it. It can't be a casual after-thought like, "Okay, we'll try it, but if there is any inconvenience to me, I'm out." No! No! No! It cannot work that way.
</p>

<p>
	Dude, you're whole paradigm is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	I have no desire to steal girls from anyone, nor do I even care much about dating or sex. It's just not a high priority once you become conscious enough.
</p>

<p>
	Sex and money are the preoccupations of children who have not yet discovered what life is really about. PUAs are childish devils. You cannot be a PUA otherwise.

<title>relative and absolute collapsable?</title>

</p>

<p>
	When you are in Absolute consciousness it's as if the relative never existed.
</p>

<p>
	When you are in relative consciousness then there's a clear difference between relative and Absolute. But that's because you're imagining the Absolute, you're not actually experiencing it.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of an Absolute is that it has no opposite. Opposites exist only in the relative domain.
</p>

<p>
	You need to distinguish between absolute vs Absolute. These are very different things. Absolute with a capital A is the actual thing itself, not an idea, word, or concept. Any time you think of the absolute you're thinking of the lowercase a absolute, not the uppercase A Absolute. Uppercase A Absolute cannot be thought at all nor can it be contrasted with the relative. Uppercase A Absolute is NOT the opposite of relative.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget the systemic, ecological, and societal aspects of food.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Yellow and Turquoise will not just care about their personal nutrition but nutrition as a global system. Which types of food should we be growing? How do we grow it in a sustainable way? What is the impact on global warming, the economy, developing countries, the rain forests, the coral reefs, children, etc. Which foods are most conducive toward elevating the consciousness of mankind? How does food intersect with education, business, government, science, spirituality, etc.?

<p>
	When traditional prayer works it's due to law of attraction and intention. Your intentions DO affect reality. Intention is very powrful when it is practiced consistently and consciously.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you intendÂ with emotion and conviction will tend to become true. Because your willÂ is a splinter off God's Will. You literally have the power of God within you. The more conscious you become the more of it you will be able to tap and manifest.
</p>

<p>
	It's not a miracle. It's because you are God, and reality is a giant Mind.
</p>

	Good stuff. Generally in the right direction towards Truth, you just need to trip a lot more and contemplate the results of your trips more. Each trip gives more clarity and raises further questions.

<p>
	It depends on what you mean by prayer. There is false and true prayer.
</p>

<p>
	False prayer is praying for God to give you stuff. This is dualistic and delusional. Although even it can work.
</p>

<p>
	True prayer is realizing that you are God and putting your heart into embodying the Truth. This can work wonders.
</p>

<p>
	Most people pray mechanically and dogmatically, not consciously andÂ nondually.
</p>

<p>
	You have to wonder, if you were fully conscious that you are God, would youÂ pray to yourself at that point? Prayer subtly implies that you think you are beneath God and separate from God.
</p>

<p>
	Then they are still not fully aware, they are only half-aware. The point of full awareness is that it makes devilry impossible. But there is much to become aware of, and many degrees of awareness, so it's easy for a devil to become half-aware and still act like a devil. Sometimes even more of a devil. Gaps in awareness are very common, which is where the devil lurks.
</p>

<p>
	In practice full awareness is very rare and difficult, so the devil always lurks around the corner.

It convinces itself that there's nothing to awaken to, and goes back to being a devil while telling itself that it is awake.
</p>

<p>
	You are not awake yet. So the most dangerous thing you can convince yourself of is that there's nothing to awaken to. That's wrong. There is lots to awaken to. So get to work!
</p>

<p>
	The seeking only stops AFTER your entire reality collapses and you are totally reborn.
</p>

<p>
	Don't burn your canoe before you crossed the river.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not futile. It is very real and palpable. Awakening is not part of the game. Yet also not separate from it.

<title>How to be aware of awareness?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/34368-how-to-be-aware-of-awareness/?do=findComment&amp;comment=414758</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The difficulty results from the fact that awareness is nothing. The mind cannot grasp it in the same way it can grasp a wall or tree or a thought.
</p>

<p>
	So by trying to become aware of awareness you are really trying to realize Nothingness/Emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's frusrating. There is no way around that. You are being asked to grasp the ungraspable.
</p>

<p>
	Through lots of practice the mind must become very still. That stillness of mind itself becomes the empty awareness of awareness. You. Are. It.
</p>

<p>
	Try focusing your mind on nothing in particular and just let it sit there. The more it sits there, the more Emptiness willÂ dawn on you. Don't try to grasp it. Let it wash over you.
</p>

	What is thereÂ to say? Yes, you can learn to astral project and visit other realities. Many books have been written about this explaining it all and how it is done. If you are serious about it buy those books and train to do it properly.

<p>

	They are attracted to non-neediness. But that is very different than treating people like crap.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget about karma. How you treat others will come back to biteÂ you.
</p>

<p>
	The more you manipulate people, the more deluded you are, the more you will suffer in life.
</p>

<p>
	Conscious & happy people do not manipulate others. By manipulating others you sell your soul to the devil.

People in Tier 1 are generally not going to react kindly to the Spiral because it means they are not at the top, the way they like to imagine themselves to be.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine how it must feel for a Christian fundamentalist to realize he is closer to the bottom than the top! ThisÂ would be totally unacceptable for the ego to admit, so it will immediately reject the whole Spiral model. Tier 2 is totally outside it's reality. It cannot be imagined or even taken as a goal. It just registers as blank.

			Regarding what you wrote about epistemic foundations. . . I don't have any formal training in epistemology, yet you suggested that I am "getting it". Is it possible to "get" the underlying essence without formal study of epistemology? Perhaps through related side routes or direct experience? For example, a lot of your videos probably have this essence without referring to it as "epistemology". As well, could a person have realizations in this area during contemplation? . . . I'm just wondering if I am missing out on something of value, yet I also don't want to have to work my way through a bunch of philosophical / intellectual weeds.

<p>
	A) Formal study does not guaratnee understanding.
</p>

<p>
	B) I have talking about epistemology a lot, both explicitly and implicitly, so if you watch my videos a lot then you get the benefit of good epistemology even if you aren't deliberately studying it.
</p>

<p>
	C) Psychedelics of course help as well.
</p>

<p>
	D) I am working on a book which ties everything together, epistemology and all. So people won't have to weed through 2000 years of crappy philosophy. But it will take some years to put it all together.

	I find such laid back positions terrible for meditation.
</p>

<p>
	But if you cannot sit any other way I suppose it's better than not sitting at all. Then again, you could practice walking meditation -- which can be very good.

<p>
	Openmindedness is such a simple notion yet it's actually very rare and challenging for most people to pull off. The mind likes to cling to one idea or another, one position or another, regardless of what the idea happens to be.
</p>

<p>
	People do not understand how closed and openmindedness works because they are not taught epistemic foundations anywhere in school or university. So they overlook the importance of openmindedness. They take the process of acquiring accurate knowledge totally for granted.
</p>

<p>
	It's a tragic flaw of our education system.
</p>

<p>
	But its gives me hope that folks like you are getting it and going meta.

<p>
	You are best off teaching yourself Yellow and above through independent study. You will learn more through independent study than in a university. Take responsibility for educating yourself. This becomes necessary if you want to grow beyond the center of gravity of your society/culture.
</p>

<p>
	Read 100 good books around this topic and you will be wiser than 99% of university professors. And you won't have to go $100,000 into debt to do it. In a sense, these days, universities are looking more and more like scam. It's not worth the price of admission when you can achieve better results by yourself at 5% of the cost. You just have to be self-driven and passionate about learning/truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you read and carefully integrate the 200 books on my book list you will have a deeper understanding of reality than 99.999% of people. And I'll be adding more books soon.

			I just didn't like the idea of being green, <u><strong>almost seemed like a step down in terms of awareness</strong></u>, just kinda attacking people all the time. I could absolutely be wrong in my very short description of stage green and there's more to green than just that, <u><strong>I simply just don't like the idea of green</strong></u>, with that being said though I recently have developed a genuine want to reduce my carbon footprint, and just reduce the amount of damage I personally do to the earth. So I have a couple of green values, but from what I see of green in terms of politics and how defensive they are I guess? I don't like green, whilst writing this comment I've decided I'm definitely gonna watch Leo's video again, see if I can get some more positive opinions on green

	OF COURSE you don't like the idea of being Green. Which is precisely the obstacle which keeps you from the higher stages. You cannot get to Yellow unless you first fully appreciate the beauty, value, and joy of Green.
</p>

<p>
	Green is still your shadow which you have not yet explored and integrated because you are prejudiced against it. Of course you want to jump right over it into Yellow. But that would be too easy and you would miss the important lessons which you deny at Green.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is not Green. That's your biased interpretation of Green based off watching too much Youtube stage Orange prejudice against Green. That prejudice has infected your mind to the point where you cannot see Green clearly.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out for people on Youtube who demonize and strawman Green, not having themselves risen to Green's level of self-awareness.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be very careful to distinguish critiques of Green from below vs from above. Green does have some legit critiques against it, but NOT the stage Orange critiques from below like those of Jordan Peterson, Sargon, Sam Harris, Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, PragerU, Stefan Molyneux, the alt-right, Red Pill, MGTOW, incels, anti-SJWs, etc. Those are all critiques of Green from below.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Yellow analysis is virtually non-existent on Youtube so you don't even know what it looks or sounds like.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like you are making progress. Just remind yourself that progress is not linear.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it can be very difficult to find financial independence.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, college degress count for very little and there are always interesting job opporunities available.
</p>

<p>
	Be creative, think outside the job, explore new avenues, keep an open mind, and cultivate hope. You don't need to know HOW you will resolve all this, just trust that you will. The details will get sorted out in the process of doing it, not beforehand.

<p>
	What amazes me is how scientifically-minded people can be so ignorant of the limits of science.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that it is highly unscientific to claim that everything can be explained by science.

<p>
	It's not thought which is the problem so much as self-referential thought.
</p>

<p>
	Practical thoughts like: "Hungry, need to buy groceries" is no problem and necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Problematic thoughts are like: "Why did I screw this up again? I'm always this way. I have been bad my whole life." Etc. These are the kind of thoughts to eliminate or let go of. These kind of thoughts reinforce the narrative of the ego self. They assume a biographical self which is an illusion.

<p>
	They work on a small scale. They do not work without mainstream society enabling it. They also do not work as a mainstream society itself because not enough people are that developed/conscious. Mainstream society needs hundreds more years of development to get there. Mainsteam society IS THEÂ spiritual community. It just happens to be at aÂ very low level of spirituality today, like 3%.

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	You guys still do not understand distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	Distinctions are NOT mind made! Distinctions are NOT concepts nor thoughts!
</p>

<p>
	Mind is a distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Made is a distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Concept is a distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Thought is a distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment/nonduality does not eliminate distinctions. Elimination is itself a distinction! Instead, you just become conscious what the true nature of a distinction is.
</p>

<p>
	So, what is a distinction?

	You have no idea. Contemplate.

<p>
	If you are going to trip you need to learn how to boost yourself out of negative states.
</p>

<p>
	You can proactively shift states at any time, rather than having them control you.
</p>

<p>
	Practice causing yourself to feel happy, excited, confident, calm, loving, etc. Practice shifting state.

<p>
	The purpose of any emotionÂ is to create behaviors necessary for the ego's survival. Mind you, I said ego's survival, not the body's survival.
</p>

<p>
	It's a preemptive defense mechanism, so that you end up getting what you want.

</p>

<p>
	Just look at enlightened people throughout history. Did they continue having sex? YES! YES! YES! How could they have sex ifÂ they did not desire it?
</p>

<p>
	You can figure this stuff out through simple deduction.

<p>
	Well obviously. That's not even the future, that's already today.
</p>

<p>
	Life in the real future will be so different it will be impossible to understand it for today's humans. There will be things far beyond humans or even living creatures. Stuff in totally new dimensions as yet unimaginable.
</p>

<p>
	I forsee a future where beings can materialize physical objects using their will and imagination through no physical mechanism. Imagine building a jumbo jet using your mind and it appears before you. With enough intelligence that should be possible. That is how God does it.

<p>
	Getting lost in the map is much more problematic than getting lost in the territory. Finding your way out of a forrest is easy compared to finding your way out of your own mind. The forrest doesn't play devilish tricks on you the way your own mind does.

</p>

<p>
	Yeah, it helps to have a deep theoretical foundation in spiritualityÂ to make sense of experiences like this.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, nonduality is so radical it does not make sense to the lowercase self. Takes a lot of trips to make sense of it all.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics make it much easier as that breathing is hard work and gets pretty messy. The breathing works more at the bodily level than the mental/understanding level. That's still useful, but don't be surprised if it doesn't make sense.

<p>
	When you fully realize what ego is, it will be like you were never even born. It will not even be possible in that moment to imagine that there could ever be a self or a human.
</p>

<p>
	A human is 100% a total illusion, including birth, death, mind, body, and biographical life. None of it has any reality whatsoever. There is no such thing as biological creatures who are born, live, and die. All that is imagination.
</p>

<p>
	But you can't understand this at all from your current state of consciousness. Your current state of consciousness IS the imagination at work, locking in "reality". Whatever it imagines is "real" for you right now.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	5-MeO is almost too powerful for such questions. You will be in such a degree of consciousness that your old life will have zero import or meaning. Your old life will simply not make any sense because it is pure illusion. Under 5-MeO human life simply does not compute. It's like looking at a 2D object from the 4th dimension. Your only desire will be to share 5-MeO with the whole world.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms or LSD are milder and better for asking such questions.

Ask when you are in a state of nondual God consciousness. See what comes up.

</p>

<p>
	But just in case, keep anÂ eye on that desire of yours. DesireÂ is a tricky thing. Desire and attachment go hand in hand. Developing a "good" spiritual ego is a common way to avoid actual awakening.
</p>

<p>
	But after you awaken you can certainly have a life purpose focused around promoting justice.

Yes, part of it is genuine but part of it is also ego.
</p>

<p>
	On some level you still don't accept or love terrorism and war. Which is a self-hatred. You have to make sure that you're changing the world not as a reaction against some part of it which you refuse to accept.
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious of why war is necessary? Of what function it serves?
</p>

<p>
	If what you seek is one half of a duality, like peace/war, then that will not work. What's necessary is to transcend both of those and discover Peace as an Absolute which unifies and embraces peace/war. That is how you get true Peace.
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem is that the terrorist too is busy creating a good world, from his POV. Everything who tries to change the world for the better is in danger of falling into the trap of the lesser jihad.
</p>

<p>
	The desire to do good cannot be takenÂ on blind faith since aÂ devil always frames what he does as good. Good intentions are not enough to create a good world. You also have to be aware of how goodness is relative.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Have you tried contemplating what the root issue is? As in: why do you feel the need to do that?
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately what you want to do here is to become conscious that all the above is something that YOU ARE DOING. Right now you're not conscious that you are doing it, in the sense that it feels like something that is happening to you. To change this, you must take ownership of it. So step 1 is: "Okay, I suspect I am doing this, but I'm not sure how or why", and step 2 is: "Okay, now let me get to the rock bottom of why I am doing this. What does it get me? How is it serving me? What is it protecting me from? What bad thing would happen if I stopped doing it?"
</p>

<p>
	Sit down with a journal, set aside a couple hours, and really bore into this. You want to get to the rock bottom of it so that you're clear and conscious of what it is and why it is. It's clearly serving your survival in some fashion. As you investigate this, the goal is not to go back into your past and find justifications or causes. It doesn't really matter what happened in the past. What matters is why you still feel the need to keep doing it today.
</p>

<p>
	If you are able to reach the rock bottom, you should feel some release. But you have to actually reach the true source of this, not just some ideas or opinions. You need the actual source. And the source may not be what you think it is. It is often something counter-intuitive like a belief such as: I am fundamentally unlovable, or, I am afraid I will die, or, I am worthless, or, I am afraid that if I give my love freely it will kill me, or, I need money to be happy, etc.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I'd contemplate this deeply sober. Then I would take some mushrooms or LSD and contemplate it again during the trip until the issue because very clear. Psychedelics are perfect for this kind of self-reflective work.
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally what's happening here is that the ego is sabotaging itself because it has a deeply flawed understanding of itself and life. The ego is stuck in some sort of unconscious survival pattern which it feels it needs.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try to address this issue from a somatic perspective. See my video: Shamanic Breathing and use that technique every day for a week and see what comes up. That should open up various blockages in your body.
</p>

<p>
	Practices like Hatha yoga might be helpful for you. Also see my video on Body Awareness. It sounds like you live too much in your head and are disconnected from your body. Body awareness practices can reconnect you with your body.
</p>

<p>
	And people don't even confuse love with the Absolute. Just the opposite. People vehemently resist the notion that love could be an Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	People are just driven by emotions like robots because they never bother to contemplate or be mindful of their emotions.

	It's sort of like trying grab one part of a blanketing using another part of the same blanket because all you have to grasp with is blanket itself. The blanket is oneness. Oneness is trying to grasp itself but can't ever succeed in total. How can a blanket grasp itself totally? It can only grasp itself partially. To grasp itself totally is must simply be itself (without any grasping). And that is enlightenment.

<p>
	Actually, all symbols are just territory. There are maps proper. A map is what you get when you confuse part of the territory for another part of the territory.
</p>

<p>
	To make this real clear: if you draw a map of Florida in the sand on a beach in Florida, your map is literally Florida. There isn't a map + Florida. There is only Florida, which includes within it a smaller version of itself drawn in the sand. So what it means for Florida to be Florida is that is has drawings of itself within itself.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the fractal nature of how this works.
</p>

<p>
	Now expand this out to reality itself. A thought/image/symbol of reality is itself a part of reality. Such that all you have in the end is reality. All you have is the territory. So in fact: the map is the territory! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Strange loops are not a bug here, they are a feature. They arise due to the self-reference problem: when you have only one thing in existence, how can it point to itself? There cannot be a duality between map/territory. Symbols cannot stand outside reality because they are within reality and because there is nothing outside reality. Inside and outside are of course one.

			The question I raise as far as when the tables will really turn and the world really get's moving is when this stuff penetrates into mainstream culture. Stage Blue people in middle and southern end of the United States don't really seem to feel the magnitude of this technological revolutions because they're not really around it.Â 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I think you underestimate its impact. Technology is always affecting culture, even in the rural South. Do they not have internet? Are they not affected by globalization? Are they not affected by Muslim migrants? Will they not be affected by driverless cars in 10 years? Are they not affected by closing factories and jobs moving to China? Are they not affected by Amazon 2-day shipping? Are they not affected by smart phones? Are they not affected by gay rights? Are they not affected by Youtube?
</p>

<p>
	You can't hide technology. Once it's mainstream it's everywhere around the world within a few years.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear, the effects of technology are not always positive. It's always a mixed bag. Stuff is changing very quickly now so there will be a lot of problems for people who are not quick adapters (which is most people). The faster one's environment changes the more mentally flexible and openminded one has to be to adapt to it. This is very big problem for stage Blue.
</p>

<p>
	All the political shifts we're seeing lately are directly connected to technological advancement.
</p>

<p>
	The 60's revolution itself was made possible by the technological developments of modern chemistry and psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Now try to imagine what might happen if 5-MeO-DMT went mainstream.

<p>
	In the 60's the US was extremely Blue. Green was very radical in the 60's. There was a huge backlash to it. And it really only emerged in California and the most advanced cities. You have to understand that what shapes culture via the media is not representative of the average people. Many people in rural America are still very Blue. They are the Fox News audience.
</p>

<p>
	Probably 70%+ of the world is at stage Blue or below. Hollywood media is not representative of that, giving a skewed picture of progress. Most people in the world are still racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and nationalist. Basically 70% of the world population is at the level of development of Nazis. Think about that.

</p>

<p>
	If you care about survival there's no escaping that you will have to handle those survival issues. For example if you're starving and you have no money or food, no amount of meditation will fix that issue. But what meditation can do is allow you to die in peace. How? Well, you'd need to become very good at meditation or you'd need to awaken to realize that death is an illusion. The body will die from lack of food, but you as God will not.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the body to be alive there's no escaping finding food.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why spirituality is not an escape from everyday obligations. That's a bad way to look at it. You want to get masterful at handling survival issues. Which in your case means: design a way to make a decent living. Don't try to offload this issue on meditation or enlightenment. Learning how to earn a decent living is a whole skillset. It's tempting to think that you can avoid developing such skillets through "finding peace" via spirituality. That's a bad approach.
</p>

<p>
	As your practice spirituality though, even though you'll still have tricky survival issues to deal with, you will deal with them more calmly and effectively. They won't stress you out as much as they would otherwise because in the end you know that whatever happens will be okay. And you will have more emotional self-control.
</p>

<p>
	A simple way to calm yourself is to breath slowly and deeply for a few minutes or hours.
</p>

<p>
	Sedona Method is also really good for clearing out emotions.

What I want is emotional mastery right now. In that case would reading everything,Â but non-dual theory suffice, in terms of getting back on course?Â

<p>
	There cannot be emotional mastery without enlightenment. Emotional mastery is even harder than enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	But if you just want to do some basic self-help stuff and work on emotional issues, yes, you can do that. You ain't gonna be anywhere near understanding the true nature of emotions. But it can be helpful.
