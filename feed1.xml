<p>
	So, it is clear that you have gotten ahead of your skiis with spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Stop worrying about spirituality and focus on shoring up the base of your pyramid. Go figure out your career and financial situation. Then you can return to spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	You need to teach yourself how to be pragmatic and how handle your basic survival needs before you go trying to transcend the world. Lucky for you, truth is not so important for this pursuit.
</p>

<p>
	The more feminine she is, the more drama she creates.
</p>

<p>
	Feminine is emotional and floaty. Which is why the highly feminine seeks the highly masculine to ground itself, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	That's why the hottest girls are often the most batshit crazy and not worth the hassle to keep. But alluring like sirens.

<p>
	Almost everyone pays taxes anyway so this is a moot point.
</p>

<p>
	And people who pay taxes are certainly biased against paying taxes for purely selfish reasons. So you're not avoiding that problem.
</p>

<p>
	Big tax payers routinely corrupt the government in order to avoid paying taxes.
</p>

<p>
	The takers aren't the poor, the takers are the rich.

<p>
	Well, tough titty. Bullies get their comeuppance. Karma.
</p>

<p>
	This is a classic characteristic of selfish people. They flaunt their selfishness and act cocky, until one day someone bigger and stronger than them acts selfishly towards them, and then they cry at the taste of their own medicine.
</p>

<p>
	When you act like an asshole inside any community, don't be surprised when one day the community excommunicates you. When that happens, of course your survival will be severely hampered -- because survival is a communal affair, yet you were being a selfish bastard, acting as though only your individual survival was at stake. NO! The entire community is at stake.

<p>
	Roosh was acting like a dick and he got slapped for it.

			I got a question 
		</p>

		<p>
			Would you consider a wild animal free?
		</p>

		<p>
			At 26:17 you talk about the myth of freedom and that it’s counterintuitive by its nature because one can never be truly free, are animals not free?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	EVERYTHING is always free. Including slavery, murder, rape, genocide, war, oppression, etc. Those are all perfectly free things.
</p>

<p>
	When a dictator oppresses you, that's total freedom at work.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, you don't want actual freedom. You want security and comfort.
</p>

<p>
	You are just confused about what you want.

			Then why do people become more conservative as they age? Isn’t that the complete opposite of what the model says? These logical inconsistencies really make me question the model.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You have to be careful with how you measure things, your personal selection biases, and how you define terms like "conservative" since it is all relative.
</p>

<p>
	A) Even old people today are still more liberal on many issues than they were 40 years ago. For example, 40 years ago most people viewed homosexuality as wrong/a mental illness, most people were openly racist and sexist, and would freak out over talk of socialism. Today, the culture has evolved so much that same people have come to accept many liberal positions like gay rights, women's equality, anti-racism, etc.
</p>

<p>
	B) Most people don't do any serious inner growth after they hit 25. They get stuck at whatever stage they are at at 25. Such people will get entrenched in their worldview and double-down on it. This is explains why they become conservative. They just stay in place while culture around them evolves. It's a relativistic thing. If culture evolves but you don't, you will look like a dinosaur even though you haven't really changed. If you were born in the 1950's and you got stuck in your development, then by the standards of 2020 you will look like a racist, sexist, homophobe, etc. Because your mind is still living in the 1960's.
</p>

<p>
	C) The majority of people do not advance even one stage after their 20's. Because they do no inner work. So most Spiral evolution happens generationallly and collectively, not at the individual level. That guy born in the 50's may still be conservative today but his children and their children will be a lot more liberal because culture has evolved a lot and their minds were not stuck in the 60's.
</p>

		<p>
			Also, in Europe (extreme) right-wing parties garner the most votes from the youth. 
		</p>

		<p>
			shouldn't this part of the population be more "evolved"?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I doubt this is statistically valid. This is probably just your selection bias because you are young yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Also, youth are easily influenced by trends and propaganda. Their is a significant chunk of American youth which is brainwashed and radicalized by right-wing propaganda and ideology. Christian youth, young conservatives, incels, alt-right, white nationalism, people who follow Jordan Peterson, etc. Even today many youth are raised by stage Blue conservative parents who indoctrinate them.
</p>

<p>
	But overall I think if you do careful statistics you will see that youth are far more liberal than their parents. Even conservative youth is still gonna be more liberal than their conservative parents. You just don't appreciate how bad their conservative parents were.
</p>

<p>
	Today's conservative youth is still far more liberal than people were in the 1950's. Almost no conservative today would say that schools should be segregated by race, that blacks shouldn't have a right to vote, that it's okay to beat women if they act up, that gays should be put in jail, and that socialists should be put on trial as traitors and blacklisted. Yet these were all common positions in the 1950's.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to be almost blind not to see how much society/culture has liberalized in the last 70 years. It's a shocking rate of evolution. People just take it for granted.
</p>

	They didn't jump on it to make a good living. They jumped on it because that's their level of consciousness/development.

	Go educate yourselves about how transitioning works before you spout off ignorant opinions about it.

<p>
	The kind of stuff we are interested in cannot be outsourced to some robot logician in a white lab coat. Such standards are totally inapplicable when we are talking about consciousness and holistic understanding of the human condition.
</p>

<p>
	There's never going to be some simple, brute-force, binary test that you can run on these kinds of models. These models require a deeply intuitive mind to comprehend. You have to be able to intuitively connect hundreds of dots using a deep intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	It's like proving evolution. There's not a single simple fact which can prove it. Evolution is a holistic model which requires connecting thousands of dots to see a bigger picture. The only reason people accept evolution today is because some geniuses connected all the dots for them and then a hundreds years later, once there has been a massive cultural shift, people think of it as obvious and factual. Likewise, it might take 100 years before Spiral Dynamics is taken seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Never forget that we are talking about the cutting edge of human knowledge here. So it will all be denied by the status quo, as usual.
</p>

<p>
	Take a look at how Ken Wilber's work has been treated by academia. It's basically been ignored, even though it's some of the most brilliant stuff that exists. But it's so advanced academia has no way of handling it so it ignores it.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is expecting academia to validate cutting edge advanced wisdom. If you want the highest wisdom and knowledge it's YOUR JOB to validate it yourself. Stop sucking on society's tit and learn to chew your own food. Nobody is going to support you in your search for Truth. No body! You will either do it all yourself, or you will not do it at all.

<p>
	If you ladies want to start a dating/relationship advice thread, go for it.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise you are loitering inside a men's locker room.

	That's not the issue. The issue is that you are not pure enough or developed enough to lead such an endeavor without it corrupting you.

<p>
	You test it by applying it in your life.
</p>

<p>
	Of course stages Blue, Orange, and Green will tend to reject SD because they all think they got reality figured out and that they are on top.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck convincing Richard Dawkins that he is stuck at Orange with his bullshit materialist logic.
</p>

<p>
	And good luck convincing a Marxist like Vaush that there is something beyond Marxism.

<p>
	A) As soon as your retreat becomes popular, that's when you will be raided. The gov will take off their kid gloves and make an example out of you by giving you a 30 year jail sentence.
</p>

<p>
	B) Even if you avoid that somehow, your retreat community will quickly devolve into devilry and become a toxic cult as ungrounded egos start to abuse it for money, power, status, and sex. You are not gonna trip your way out of this problem.
</p>

<p>
	C) People will have freakouts and get injured. They will then report you to Feds out of spite.

	It's a cool idea, but Canada will shut you down once they catch wind of what you're doing.
</p>

<p>
	If you are really serious you need to buy a ship and sail it in international waters and sythesize your own chems on the ship.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, the coast guard will certainly raid you once you get close to shore. So you'd have to dump all your chems in international waters before docking.

<p>
	Those corporations will be democratized in the long-term AND they will become more conscious and loving in themselves due to the overall Spiral growth of society.
</p>

<p>
	Corporations are evolving too.
</p>

<p>
	And I'm all for heavily regulating corporations.
</p>

<p>
	I have no problem with the Feds regulating YT's ban protocol by installing an official court. This will definitely happen in the future.
</p>

<p>
	There will not be corporate tyranny because society is evolving away from tyranny of all sorts.

<p>
	You have to understand that today's corporations and online media is just a transitional phase.

<p>
	Don't act like women are not looking to score with the top 5% of guys.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that since a woman's survival agenda is different, her standards for what "top 5% of guys" means is different. It's not about looks, it's about all the other factors relevant to a woman's survival.
</p>

<p>
	Really, what the best form of pickup does is turn a guy into the top 1% of guys, making him highly desirable to women by default, without any tricks.
</p>

<p>
	For example, after all the work I have done on myself, I know I'm in the top 1% of what women want. And a woman who sleeps with me will know it and fall completely in love. This didn't happen by accident. This happened through 20 years of constant labor. But you ladies care nothing about the labor that went into it. You just want the end result and never to wonder about how the sausage was made.
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>Pickup is NOT about tricking women into sex. Pickup is about becoming an exceptionally valuable man.</strong></u>
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, pickup is about outshining all the other lazy wolves.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a story:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Two guys are hiking barefoot through the forest when they stumble upon a giant angry grizzly bear. The first guy calmly starts taking out the running shoes from his backpack and lacing them up. The second guy looks at him and say, "Are you stupid? You can't outrun a bear." To which the first guy replies, "I don't need to outrun the bear. I only need to outrun you."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>

<p>
	If right-wingers keep coming here and complaining about race and western civilization, you will get banned.
</p>

<p>
	There is way too much culture war shit going on on this sub-forum lately. You're not going to distract this forum with such nonsense. If you can't deal with multiculturalism, that's your problem, not ours. And we are not going to waste our time babying you.
</p>

<p>
	Gaslight all you want, but it won't fly here.
</p>

<p>
	There is far too much pro-Trump rhetoric on this forum. I expect better of your guys.
</p>

<p>
	This a sub-forum about CONSCIOUS Politics, not partisan bickering or ideology.
</p>

<p>
	Consider yourselves warned. If you keep bringing up culture war issues, you will be banned.

	Men who are sexually frustrated and weak are the ones who will then turn toxic. Just go to an incel forum and look at how those incels think of women. As bad as pickup guys can be, incels are worse.

<p>
	That's cute, but don't conflate relative and absolute domains.
</p>

<p>
	Dating is a relative domain and there are certainly winners and losers, just like in chess.

<p>
	Again, it seems that way TO YOU because you're looking at it from a woman's survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	It's like I am trying to teach a wolf how to hunt rabbits, and you -- as rabbit -- enter the chat and start talking about how hunting rabbits is unnecessary and troubling to you, without any concern that the wolf will starve if he is not taught how to hunt. The wolf is not going to survive on carrots, he needs meat.

<p>
	You should distinguish between equality under law vs cultural norms and values. We will never has equality at the cultural level, and that's being asked for. What's being fought for is equality under law and equality in material treatment, like in the workplace.

			The socialization skills part of pick up is awesome but that's obviously not the main objective. Plenty of women sleep around but sleeping with someone you barely know is far more risky to a woman than it is to men. You give men advice here on how to get the kind of women who are willing to do that, not how to get a long term girlfriend.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	ALL women are willing to sleep with a cool guy. This is not some special slutty subset of women.
</p>

<p>
	There is not difference between what attracts a woman partying at a club with her friends vs a women sitting at home reading books and shopping for groceries once a week. The only difference is that the one sitting at home is harder to reach. And to get her during that narrow window at the grocery store requires serious practice in settings where women are plentiful.
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to get a long-term girlfriend without first attracting and sleeping with her.
</p>

<p>
	I highly recommend long-term girlfriends. But before that happens, the man has to build himself up and fix his internal weaknesses and learn how to attract women in general.

<p>
	No. The city is irrelevant and the kind of woman is also irrelevant.

<p>
	I rarely meet psychologically or spiritually healthy humans.
</p>

<p>
	Most women are nuts. But hey... you can't live without them, and you can't live with 'em. So here we are <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, this conversation is not for you. You are looking at it from a woman's self-biased perspective -- obviously. But a man has a different survival agenda than you. The man has no obligation to explain or justify his survival agenda to women, just as women have no obligation to do so to men. Most women have zero interest in understanding a man's survival agenda. So unless you're truly interested in that, its best to stay out of this discussion because it's really not about helping you, it's about helping guys.
</p>

<p>
	If we were having a discussion about helping women find men, the tables would be turned.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is trying to impose your survival agenda on the opposite sex or expecting the opposite sex to surrender their survival agenda to suit you. Women are not going to surrender their survival agenda, and nor will men. It's called "game" for this reason. It's a sophisticated game of chess and both sides are playing to win.
</p>

<p>
	If you act like you're not playing this game, that's precisely the game you're playing. Whether you know it or not, or admit it or not, the game is being played.
</p>

<p>
	This is a grey area. This forum is certainly not going to allow sex trafficking, but this case of escorting is more like sex work rather than sex trafficking. And the legalities of such things will vary from country to country.
</p>

<p>
	We'll allow this for now, but don't let it get out of hand or into illegalities.
</p>

<p>
	As for whether it's a good plan at all... well...

<p>
	In online dating the opening line is largely irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	Put all your energy into upgrading the quality of your photos.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do well with online dating, hire a professional photographer for $500 to do all your photos.
</p>

<p>
	Your photos MUST look awesome.
</p>

	Just cause you socialize with lots of women doesn't mean you sleep with all of them. Not even close.

			This is what I'm trying to understand:
		</p>

		<p>
			1) It is often mentioned that I create the Universe, the Moon and every creature and object and every hair on my body, and infinite amount of forms etc.  
		</p>

		<p>
			While at the same time you say that:
		</p>

		<p>
			2) "When you are aware of it, you create it"
		</p>

		<p>
			So something exists ONLY if I am aware of it?
		</p>

		<p>
			Did I create an alien in some other Galaxy? 
		</p>

		<p>
			But I am not aware of the alien or any Galaxies.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am only aware of a thought about an alien. Which means that the alien exists only as this particular thought? 
		</p>

		<p>
			But why then mention other creatures, objects, planets, humans and everything else that I am not aware of and say that I created them?   
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like a video game renderer, you create whatever is on screen right now.
</p>

<p>
	So right now you are creating the thought of an alien in some other galaxy.
</p>

<p>
	But if you get on a space ship and fly to that galaxy which you imagine, and meet that alien which you imagine, you will be creating that galaxy and that alien.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you see is PRECISELY what you are creating. Nothing more, nothing less. Precisely!
</p>

	Well, that works too. Approaches are approaches. It does not matter where, when, or how many.

<p>
	The mall can be a great place to approach.

<p>
	My first success came from a mall approach. It was a thing of beauty. Hot 25 year old girl was walking and talking to her mother on the phone. I stopped her and told her to hang up on her mom. She did. We talked for 5 minutes. A few days later we got a coffee and she slept with me. Amazing girl.

	It's not ironic at all.
</p>

<p>
	Taking 100% responsibility is the foundation of our work here.
</p>

<p>
	My criticism of libertarians is that they shirk collective responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	You must be both individually responsible AND collectively responsible. That's what I teach. Just one or the other is not good enough.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, in this work I expect you go above and beyond what any normal person is willing to do. That's the key to becoming an amazing human. You must be willing to do what others are too lazy to do.
</p>

<p>
	I am giving advice for guys who are SERIOUS about becoming great. If you're happy with mediocrity, my advice isn't for you.

	Roosh is dumb.

<p>
	Gives pickup a bad name.
</p>

<p>
	A perfect example of a stage Blue/Orange reactionary against Green. Culture war drivel and toxic masculinity.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately this kind of ideology is common within the pickup community. The ideology that can come with pickup techniques is like mind cancer. It's utterly selfish and self-biased. Classic devilry and projection.

<p>
	That's exactly why practice is crucial.
</p>

<p>
	Any time a girl makes eye contact with you like that, you MUST open her. She'll be super receptive. Her giving you that eye contact is like her writing on her forehead: "I will date you"

			This is the most disillusioning thread until now for me. Leo advice is to ask out hundreds of girls a month (!), tell 'em if they are not in line you'll spank 'em like she you little sister (I'm a single Child, so I don't know what to say about that).

<p>

<p>
	When you are aware of it, you create it.
</p>

<p>
	Feel the hair on your arm. As you feel it, you create it. Awareness IS creation.
</p>

<p>
	You are not aware that you are creating Everything. Because you're asleep.
</p>

<p>
	All I'm saying is that you CAN become aware of how you designed it. Obviously you're not anywhere near that degree of consciousness right now. Which is why is seems so outlandish to you.

<p>
	Obviously one can get a boner naturally rather than by using Viagra.

<p>

They are not about seeking pleasure.
</p>

<p>
	There is no internal mechanism that you can open which will give you the consciousness possible on 5-MeO-DMT, for example. But you can only understand that by doing lots of it. Which of course you will refuse to do because you think you've got reality figured out.

<title>Libertarian Examples Mega-Thread</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/51170-libertarian-examples-mega-thread/?do=findComment&amp;comment=667666</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<p>
	This clip here has a nice explanation of the problems with unlimited free speech which libertarians love to argue for:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mynWhShRHBk?start=269&feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	So what libertarians don't understand about unlimited free speech is that it gets exploited by clever egos to actually take away the free speech of others, leading to an overall reduction in free speech for all.
</p>

<p>
	This is a microcosmic case of the larger macrocosmic problem with unlimited freedom as I discussed in my libertarian video. The paradox of freedom is that unlimited forms of it lead to oppression. Which is what libertarians refuse to understand.
</p>

<p>
	Vaush's analysis here is precisely correct as he understands the counter-intuitive ways in which freedom can backfire. The guy he's arguing against does not understand this because he isn't taking into account the clever and radically selfish ways in which ego will exploit his unlimited free speech. And of course the hypocrisy is that even that guy must admit of restriction on speech in case of threats of violence.
</p>

<p>
	Also notice how the libertarian guy does not have an understanding of relativity when Vaush pushes him with examples of white people being offended by the presence of black people in a restaurant. To a libertarian this does not compute because he naively thinks that white people cannot legitimately feel oppressed by the mere presence of a black person. Which of course they can and do!
</p>

<p>
	Vaush does a brilliant job of breaking this guy down.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a thread about empathy for rape victims.
</p>

<p>
	The context of this thread is: "female celebrities getting away with sexual misconduct"
</p>

<p>
	The reason this happens is because the standards for female sexual misconduct are very different -- and SHOULD be very different -- than the standards for male sexual misconduct. Because the male can be much more forceful about it.
</p>

<p>
	It baffles me that you guys are having a hard time understanding this. It would help if you set your woke-scolding aside for a moment and try to understand why I communicated what I did.

<p>
	Most men get raped by other men.
</p>

<p>
	I was not minimizing male on male rape. I was minimizing females raping males. Which is such a silly and rare thing that it isn't worth talking about in the context of males raping females.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying it cannot ever happen. I'm saying it's absurd to act as though men face anywhere near the same threat from females as females face from males. This is a difference by a factor of at least 100x if not 1000x.
</p>

<p>
	So spare me your SJW woke scolding and outrage.
</p>

<p>
	The average male faces zero threat ever of getting physically restrained and raped by a female.
</p>

<p>
	I have never in my life worried that a woman would rape me. Like zero chance of that. I worry more about getting hit by lightning. Yet if I was a woman I would have those worries frequently throughout my life. Which is why women hitting on men is not such a big deal.
</p>

<p>
	You misunderstand what equal means. You are taking it too literally which leads to absurdities like: "That means a man should be able to talk into a woman's dressing room" or "A woman should be allowed to walk around on the sidewalk topless."
</p>

<p>
	Equality means fair treatment while respecting gender differences.

	FoxNews and Breitbart is white nationalist propaganda. Trump has white nationalists working in his admin right now. You're just ignorant of these things. This is not an exaggeration or a strawman. It just is what it is. You're just in denial about it.

<p>
	Cougar on the prowl.
</p>

<p>
	The difference is, she can't rape that guy.
</p>

<p>
	Although given how heavy she's going at him in that video, I do wonder... <img alt="O.o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/blink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/blink@2x.png 2x" title="O.o" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	See, if a guy gets raped by a woman, he will most likely enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
	Not so the other way around.

</p>

<p>
	75 approaches per month?? That's why the guy isn't getting his dream girl. You gotta be doing 5x-10x more.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously not every girl will be attracted to you. It makes no difference. If you do 750 approaches per month, you will get many girls attracted to you.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to tell when a girl gets attracted. Hook-point is usually reached within 5 minutes of an approach.
</p>

<p>
	And yes, the quality of your approach matters A LOT. Girls are attracted to PERSONALITY. If you can't display your awesome personality within 5-10 minutes, you'll lose lots of girls who would otherwise get attracted.
</p>

<p>
	If you approach 1000 girls, you will attract at least a few stunners, and many average girls.
</p>

<p>
	PUAs are not lying to you. They get crazy results because they go out so much and approach so much and they got crazy good game that will take you years to develop. I have befriended many PUAs, not professional coaches but ordinary guys. And they get laid a lot.
</p>

<p>
	A knew a newbie virgin guy who moved to Vegas and started doing PUA. He was had average looks and average height. A bit chubby. He was a total virgin. Within a few months he slept with something like 20 or 30 girls. It was amazing. Of course Vegas is uniquely good for pickup, but still. Even for Vegas that's a lot.

	The state needs to be at least large enough to manage nuclear weapons and prevent private actors from getting their hands on them. And that's just one out of thousand problems.

	He's simply not conscious of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	God-realization is a very advanced stage of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You have to go really deep to realize that you are God and that you created the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	Just because someone is a Buddhist does not make him God-realized.
</p>

<p>
	The only proper answer to the question of "Does God exist?" is: YOU ARE GOD! DUMMY!

	As with all things, there is criticism from above and from below.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that most criticism I see is from below. But that doesn't mean it cannot be criticized from above.

<p>
	Feminism is a very diverse cultural movement. Are there some excessive aspects to it? How could there not be?

		<p>
			I've personally wasted a lot of time learning various technical design skills, or different marketing tactics while the most effective strategy was to focus on one or a few things, master them and then leverage it. Thats probably not as damaging as becoming a Nazi or getting into other kind of toxic ideology, but still, holds you back a lot if you're not aware of it happening

			It seems shame can be effective in some contexts. Yet can it also be counter-productive in some contexts? A lot of people aren’t overtly racist, yet they have a vague sense of ethnocentrism and are ok benefitting from systemic biases that are in their favor. Sometimes, it seems calling it to their attention without any shame is more effective.

<p>
	Sure, this requires what the Buddhists call skillful means.

			Youtube does have an OBVIOUS agenda when it comes to the trending tab. It favours traditional media and late night shows, while often neglecting independent content creators.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Obviously.
</p>

<p>
	This is not because big media is paying them. This is because YT wants to serves up more authoritative sources and smaller fringe independent creators are less trustworthy. YT can safely assume that CNN or MSNBC will not serve up racist content. YT cannot assume that about small creators who could be Neo-Nazis or the like. Even with PewDiePie vs Jimmy Fallon, YT can trust Jimmy Fallon a lot more than PewDiePie not to say some racist or false shit.
</p>

<p>
	The bigger YT gets, the more mainstream it must be because mainstream is the only way to sustain the largest viewership numbers.
</p>

<p>
	Google's search algorithm does the same thing with websites. Google heavily favors mainstream authoritative sources vs no-name indie blogs. Because mainstream sources can be trusted as having some kind of journalistic standards.
</p>

<p>
	If Google did not do this, it's algorithm would quickly be gamed by spammers, hackers, and the scum of the internet.
</p>

<p>
	Most normies have no clue how scummy the internet is. Google serves up a highly sanitize version of the internet after filtering out 90% of the scum.
</p>

<p>
	Google's search algorithm literally has a list of the top 1000 sites that Google hand-selected as authoritative sources. And this list seeds the authority of the entire internet basically. Any links coming from those 1000 sources determine the authority of every webpage on the entire internet.

	No-self is a higher degree of consciousness than an OBE or a formed mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	The highest realization is that you have no form whatsoever. There is no reason to get out of your body because you were never in your body to begin with. You are omnipresent. You cannot go anywhere because you are already everywhere and everywhere is nowhere and nothing.
</p>

			Feminism, pick up, socialism, conservativism, MRAs, right extremists... At some point you gotta ask yourself what's the point of using all these terms though, when there are so huge diversity in how these words are used and perceived. Like, if I tell a crowd of 20 people that I'm a "feminist" or that I do "pick up ", and those 20 people have totally different definitions/views on those terms, wouldn't it then be better if I said " I'm a huge believer of equal rights and I feel like we still have a long way to go" or " I really enjoy approaching girls and getting to share my authentic self and by that giving both her and my self a pleasant experience which could potentially lead to something more"? It would obviously make the communication more clear at least.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Congrats! You've discovered the trade-off between brevity and clarity.
</p>

<p>
	"I'm a huge believer of equal rights and I feel like we still have a long way to go" << even if you said that every time instead of "feminism" you'd still be stuck with a lack of clarity. Now you'd have to define "equal rights" and "a long way to go".
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you in order to get full clarity you would have to define every single term in your entire worldview/mind. But you'd be dead before then. And still, people would misunderstand you because they lack your reference experiences used to define the terms.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is a slippery beast. Which is why this stuff gets argued about for ages without resolution.
</p>

<p>
	It's called a rabbit hole for a reason. It works like a funnel. You start watching Joe Rogan talk about comedy. Then you watch him interview Jordan Peterson. Then you go to Jordan Peterson's channel. Then you start getting anti-SJW content. Then you start getting racist stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You're not understanding how this works.
</p>

<p>
	YT isn't doing it. YOUR MIND is doing it because every mind is interested in validating its existing worldview.
</p>

<p>
	YT is just a mirror of your own mind. It serves you up what your mind wants to watch.
</p>

	Bill Gates already has EVERYTHING he could ever want. He has beaten the game of life 100 times over.

<p>
	Being nice to minorities is a systemic and cultural issue more so than a personal one. No one cares if you're an asshole as a person. The issue that people care about most is systemic inequality and bullying, which is baked into the culture.

<p>
	Actually, demanding conservatives not to be dicks to minorities has little collateral damage.

<p>
	It's reasonably health and necessary. I don't see how else you do it. It's not like conservatives and racists are gonna admit wrong-doing or change their way of life unless some pressure is applied. The whole point of conservatives is that they will resist ANY change whatsoever. That's their game. And then they justify it with whatever excuses sound good to them.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes to get a bully to understand that his bullying is bad, you must give him a taste of his own medicine. The problem is that a bully doesn't understand that his bullying hurts others until he feels the hurt reflected back on him by those he hurt.
</p>

<p>
	So when a racist is publicly shamed or deplatformed, it hurts him, and then he gets a taste of what it feels like to be bullied as a minority.
</p>

<p>
	See, racists used to be a majority who bullied the minority, but now they are starting to become the minority who gets bullied by the majority, and this scares the shit out of them. It creates an existential crises of them.
</p>

<p>
	The tables have turned and the racists and devils are getting hoisted by their own petards. That's the problem with devilry -- it always boomerangs.

<p>
	That's precisely why there needs to be a stronger federal government with much better funding and strict protocols in place as soon as a new virus hits.
</p>

<p>
	This virus is directly the result of libertarian-like approach to government: let's just do nothing and the free market will fix itself.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds nice in theory, but in practice leads to mass death and economic horror.
</p>

<p>
	This virus is a failure of effective, competent, proactive government.

<p>
	So by your logic, in the Civil War, the North was fascist against the South.
</p>

<p>
	And during the Civil Rights movement in the 60's, black people were fascist against white people.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the whole trick with building a good society is that selfish people have to be forcibly restrained or at least shamed from being selfish because a selfish person will not do so of his own recognizance.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes equality gotta be forced.

At this point it's basically become the default method of information exchange for so many millions of people that the corporation has become incredibly powerful in terms of controlling what people's eyeballs see. I mean I guess they're doing a good enough job as it is, but at the same time some sort of regulations could ensure that it doesn't abuse its power for one malicious end or another?

<p>
	Yes, of course all massively popular social media platforms need government regulation and oversight.
</p>

<p>
	The feds could set up an "online media court" which handles cases like that of YT vs Stefan Molyneux or Alex Jones, where an impartial and well-educated panel of judges adjudicates whether community guidelines were violated or not, and the whole thing can be aired live on YT for all citizens to see. This would be a huge win for liberal democracy, free speech, and civil rights.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to ban people as long as the process of getting banned is fair and transparent, and the person has an ability to defend himself against strawman arguments or being taken out of context.

<p>
	It's more complicated than that. Because conservatives still fundamentally believe that being a man or a woman is "real", "objective", and "scientific" while other identities are not.
</p>

<p>
	The real issue here is how many trans and gay teens end up killing themselves because they get bullied, harassed, and mocked for their sexual identity/preferences.
</p>

<p>
	If conservatives stop mocking and bullying trans and gay people, then there won't be a big issue about pronouns and the like.
</p>

<p>
	See, this is being framed by conservatives as if trans people are oppressing them, when really it's mostly about conservatives who want the freedom to bully trans and gay people.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, government is going to take away your freedom to bully and mock people of different sexual identities. Sorry. You're not gonna win that battle.

<p>
	Nudity is also against TOS for obvious reasons. Millions of kids use YT.
</p>

<p>
	YT does not promote racist or sexist stuff. It is against their TOS and YT just banned a bunch of big racists channels. Moderating such stuff is very challenging. Overall YT is doing a good job, considering how many thousands of new videos are uploaded each minute to YT.

			I do believe identities can be delusional. My ego had to shred some it loved to be identified with, but were too hard to maintain due to the fact that it wasn't grounded on reality anymore. Beside, we wouldn't freak out every time one of them is threatened, and need for that sophisticated self-deception mechanism to kick in, if all we needed was a meer identification with something to be it.

<p>
	Youtube is a technology platform. It doesn't "welcome" anything. It is not Youtube's job to micromanage the content that people upload. All that YT asks is that people don't upload hateful, racist, sexist, toxic, violent, illegal stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Joe Rogan has one of the biggest audiences in the world. It's his responsibility to vet for dangerous clowns and ideologues. Most of Rogan's audience is not even on YT.

<p>
	That's how they imagine themselves to be.

<p>
	But in practice they are like this:

<p>
	Society has NEVER EVER been consensual. That's what you misunderstand.
</p>

<p>
	You are whining about the inconvenience of isolation when your ancestors had to die in war to defend your ability to exist.
</p>

<p>
	You seem to not understand how community works. Your community will force you to do WHATEVER IS NECESSARY for the community's survival. Welcome to Earth, human.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	No, they are selfish cowards and they will manipulate to avoid death when it comes knocking on their door.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarians are not some morality superior heroes. They are naive and deeply selfish people acting out their own personal survival, which happens to include surviving the libertarian mind virus which has taken them as host.
</p>

<p>
	The libertarian is not a hero because he does not understand the consequences of his philosophy. So this simply makes him a fool. Like a child playing with a loaded gun. The child is not a brave hero for doing so.

	Wrong is invented by your mind.

<p>
	But do keep in mind how you'd feel if someone murdered your mom.
