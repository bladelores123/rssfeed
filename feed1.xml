	Apple and Microsoft, both trillion dollar companies, release software updates which break their whole system and require immediate patches.
</p>

<p>
	And you expect some rinky-dink Iowa app to not have bugs?
</p>

<p>
	This is a joke, not evidence of rigging.
</p>

<p>
	Alternative media's vision is way too clouded by their hatred of the establishment and desire for Bernie to win. Textbook definition of projection and confirmation bias.
</p>

<p>
	The mind only sees evidence which validates its ideology.

</blockquote>

<p>
	A) There is no real discussion with such people because they are just parroting Marxist dogma. They are not contemplating anything about reality for themselves. They thing Marxism is best, period.
</p>

<p>
	B) They have no clue what Love is or means.
</p>

<p>
	C) Society is always moving towards greater Love, regardless of what Marxists say or do. Some "Great Awakening" is not needed. And of course these Marxist have no clue how significant even one individual awakening is.
</p>

<p>
	D) Humans do change. Spiral Dynamics shows that humans can be at very different levels of development. And even way beyond Spiral Dynamics. A human cannot be considered independently of its culture and society. So changing society changes humans and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	E) Don't forget that Marxists adopt scientific materialism as a dogma, so their understanding of politics and reality cannot go very high. They have no clue how central consciousness is to the development of society and humans. To dismiss this by making fun of chakras is just ignorant. Total strawman.
</p>

<p>
	F) All their "logic" is self-biased. Logic has nothing to do with truth.
</p>

<p>
	G) Individual growth is crucial for developing an advanced society. This is not mutually exclusive with also developing social infrastructure. Both are crucial.
</p>

<p>
	H) These Marxists are so reactionary to captialism that their whole worldview gets distorted and biased by their judgments and hatreds, unable to see some of the important necessities of capitalism, and that there is more than just capitalism vs socialism to consider, there are meta issues at stake, and that capitalism and socialism are not really polar opposites or enemies.
</p>

<p>
	Ideological retorts will not do here. One must deeply contemplate the nature of all things for oneself. Marxism's fundamental flaw is its materialist metaphysics and epistemology. That puts a glass ceiling on how high it can go. And it has a structual problem of being an ideology. It is not conscious of itself and incapable of deep self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
	A monkey with a Marxist ideology is still a monkey. And dangerously ignorant.
</p>

	You guys are way too into this conspiracy shit. Everything is a conspiracy against Bernie. Sometimes a bug is just a bug.

<p>
	You ever write software? You know how many bugs it can have?

<p>
	There is no indication of any rigging. Just a logistical failure.

	If evidence emerges, then we can discuss further.
</p>

<p>
	Until then, be patient and we should have the results verified soon.

<p>
	It's far more twisted than that.
</p>

<p>
	Your thinking about consciousness is far too limited. Consciousness is unlimited. So your inability to imagine how is irrelevant. Conscious isn't limited to your human mind.
</p>

<p>
	All there is, is absolutely everything.
</p>

<p>
	How? How can it have any limits? What would limit it? What would stop it? Anything that might stop it is itself, which means it cannot be stopped. It has unlimited power. Imagine that: unlimited power.

	If being human is an illusion, certainly being white is an illuison.
</p>

<p>
	100 years ago Einstein showed that time and space were relative. And yet today people still think being a white human is grounded in something real? Lol
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Why don't you apply the same logic to meditation or driving a car?
</p>

<p>
	Every time a new technology comes out some caveman will say, "But it's better to do it the old fashioned way. More pure."
</p>

<p>
	So then by this logic you should wipe your ass with your hands. Sure, you could use TP, but what have you sacrificed? Why are you deluding yourself out of desperation? Why don't you patiently wash the shit off your hands each time? This will toughen you up. It will make you a read man. What kind of Buddha are you if you cannot stand a bit of shit between your fingernails? Only a desperate and greedy person would seek a better way. It's bound to backfire. This is antithetical to being human. God wants you to wipe you ass with your hangs like the Buddha did. My guru wiped his ass with his hands therefore so should everyone else. For sure your knowledge of your ass will be tainted if you don't get the full experience of wiping it with your hands. You will not understand the ins and outs of ass-wiping fully. Your technique will be bad. The gods will be displeased and not give you blessings. The gods gave you two hands for a reason, one to eat your food and the other to wipe your ass.

	Lots of red flags around Athene.
</p>

<p>
	As soon as you spot a manipulator, that's the biggest tell-tale sign of devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Truly selfless and awakened people have no desire to control or manipulate others, not even for their own good or awakening. Not even to save the world. Manipulation itself is ignorance, greed, and fear made manifest.
</p>

<p>
	God has no desire to manipulate people. Only a dispassionate hope that they wise up and awaken.

			I'm not doing the 'work' because decades ago I have awakened to the realization there is nothing to do, no work, no accomplishment to achieve and no truth to attain. Working to have no ego is like trying to ban your own self from the forum of your own being which attempting to do often is just fodder for more self suffering.
		</p>

		<p>
			Liberation is presence of being in the moment free of self suffering....everything else is story telling so just tell a joyful story if one must tell one.

<p>
	That's is a half-truth.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense it's right. But in another sense it's deeply problematic to hold this view.
</p>

<p>
	I don't care how awake you may be, you've got more work to do, more things to become conscious of. If you're not here to do inner work, then you have no reason to be here at all. And feeding newbies the idea that they have no inner work to do leads them down a cul de sac of inaction, laziness, and apathy.
</p>

<p>
	The ego would love nothing more than to believe it needs to do no work.
</p>

<p>
	After you've done a ton of work, then you can talk about how you don't need to do work.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a billionaire talking about how work is unnecessary. Yes, for him it's unnecessary because he's already done enough to live off the interest. But this is not appropriate advice for people who struggle to pay for food.

It would heal his auto-immune illness and turn one of the most known "rational Christian philosopher" (for the lack of a better term) into a Mystic. The biggest Problem with Christians (those here in Europe, your Christians in the US are more similar to the ones we had in the middle ages) is, they believe that the Devil tries to bring them of the path by doubting the religion.<br />
			<br />
			Ironically, by blindly following the bible or some deluded priests they fall into the Devils trap... I believe they first need to understand that their religion is not just a conceptualization of the truth that Jesus saw, but also a philosophical interpretation by those who wrote and taught it.  <br />
			<br />
			A lot of catholic priests here in Europe are borderline mystics. They simply need the tools. Once it reaches the Vatican, Christianity WILL develop. Priests have mystical experiences (mostly Love), they just need a little push into the right direction.

<p>
	Yes, it's a problem.
</p>

<p>
	I have spoken out against it and will continue to do so.
</p>

<p>
	I also try to lock down such threads after a while.
</p>

<p>
	But to some extent is has to be allowed to play itself out. People are where they're at. Most people see the world through the POV and self-biases of their gender and refuse to see it from the other side. This requires a Tier 2 meta perspective which many people here lack and I certainly can't beat it into you.

	Create an inspiring vision for your life and discipline yourself to work towards it.
</p>

<p>
	See Life Purpose Course. This will make you feel empowered rather than dwelling in victim-hood.

	Spend lots of time visioning. Vision is crucial here.

<p>
	Peace comes when you realize value is an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Let go of needing to feel valuable. Notice that peace remains in its place. Simple.
</p>

<p>
	The point of years of meditation is to forget all about value. When you were a toddler you had zero value and life was great. As a teen you started to chase value and life started to suck. The more you chase value the worse you will feel about life.

<p>
	No they don't. You merely assume they do and they are good at acting.

<p>
	If you become conscious enough you can see that pain itself is a self-bias. There is no reason why pain is worse than pleasure. This preference is a self-bias and distortion of truth.
</p>

<p>
	But that requires some crazy levels of consciousness outside the ability of most people. Don't even dream of it unless you are a full-time monk.

			I sometimes doubt this. I have had quite deep conversations with a muslim friend who is incredibly trapped into Islamic dogma, and have had him grasp much better how a piece of garbage in the woods <em>is </em> God (we were literally walking out in nature, and I used that as an example) than other hyper-scientific and "progressive thinking" friends understand that different religions are all referring to the very same thing, in the same ways that different languages all serve the same purpose of communication. "Oh no no no..." they'll say... "some religions are way worst than others, and by no means are they about the same!!! the only thing that they have in common are the stupid people who follow them"... well, haha there may also be a little bit of truth in that, but we never get passed an evasive response like that because they're literally allergic to anything that gets remotely away from their materialistic rationality. Their minds are just as paradigm locked for the rest of their lives, never to find God.<br />
			<br />
			Edit: the fact alone that I have this muslim friend (and other super religious friends) is something I attribute to the fact that I <em>can </em>understand them. My "scientific" friends are absolutely incapable of this, and thus they will "tolerate" religious people, but they are unable to have an actual close friendship with them, as I can.

<p>
	It seems that way on the surface, but in practice that Muslim is less morally and cognitively developed than an atheist.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are exceptions. I'm speaking more broadly.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Orange is more developed than Blue. That Muslim has yet to go through the atheist and rationalist stage and in practice he will be a bigger devil.
</p>

<p>
	If he is a stage Green Muslim then he might be above the typical atheist. But stage Green Muslims are a tiny percentage of the population.

<p>
	No one is stopping a kid from praying in public school.
</p>

<p>
	That's not the issue. The issue is that those who complain about not being able to pray in public school actually have the hidden agenda to disseminate their favorite religion via public school. They want to use government to promote their religion and indoctrinate kids.

<p>
	Try self-love
</p>

<p>
	Didn't Christ teach you to love? If not, WTF was he teaching you?
</p>

<p>
	Why must you turn Christ into a devil?

</p>

<p>
	You can play cute Zen games, but in practice this confuses people and discourages contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation is crucial. Just sitting around is not good enough.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of Tao requires contemplation and profound questioning.
</p>

<p>
	After 10,000 hours of contemplation, yes, then you can just sit.
</p>

			Welp, what I see is all of my very best friends from college being deeply deeply locked in the scientific rational paradigm, having no understanding or tolerance whatsoever for anything that comes slightly close to religion. They weren't brainwashed into religion as children, but that didn't end up any better... I am able to fully empathize with both worlds, and that's because I've experienced both of them fully, and transcended them.

	Technically it is better. But yes, that's a separate problem.

	Just sit and admit you don't know. Sit silently. Nobody is ever going to give any existential answers. You can only get them in the silence. Stop asking for answers. Each answer you ask for only deludes you further.

<p>
	You become complete when you realize that all value is relative and worthiness is non-existent.
</p>

<p>
	That's the whole point of awakening, to become complete.
</p>

<p>
	Your thinking about this whole problem is precisely backwards, which is why you try and try and keep failing. And you will always fail until you realize that value, worth, and incompleteness are illusions.
</p>

<p>
	You can't become complete so long as your mind is attached to a finite and relative identity.

			Deida says the opposite though! He says that the Masculine in the Absolute sense is Consciousness which is stoically present with the Feminine, which is all form. It's the Feminine which is coming at the Masculine in ever-changing ways!! I didn't quite get this, cuz from what I know, masculine energy is forward-moving energy and femininity is receptive as you're saying.

		<p>
			What do you think he means when he says this?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	He is speaking from a more metaphysical/spiritual perspective there.
</p>

<p>
	They are not contradictory. The point is that masculinity is grounded and stable while femininity is floaty and more playful.
</p>

<p>
	You can be grounded, stable, and active, and penetrate the world with your energy all at the same time.

</p>

<p>
	Good for you, but most molested kids don't get over it so easily.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a matter of judgment but a matter of creating paradigm lock in a child's mind. Which is as big a problem as molesting a child.

	Well, to be fair, these can be tough judgment calls and my judgment calls are relative. But then again, this whole forum exists in the relative domain and someone has to moderate it.
</p>

<p>
	It's never a pleasant decision to ban someone. I would rather not have to ban anyone. But as I get too permissive people take advantage. Over the years I've found that it's almost impossible to reform a problematic user. I guess that's why society invented prisons.

<p>
	No because once such a person is identified I have found that there is no correcting their behavior no matter how much I reason with them. The whole point is that if such a person was open to correction or reason, they wouldn't be identified as needing a ban in the first place. Such people are not aware of what they are doing and cannot help themselves act how they act and think how they think.
</p>

<p>
	Any time a person is a banned, the response is always the same: they blame me and they always have a story about how they are right. After that, there is definitely no reasoning with them.

That's the problem. Thinking you're aware vs being aware are two different things.

<title>Purging Bullshitters</title>

<p>
	Just a heads up, I'm in the process of checking and banning people on this forum who are consistent bullshitters, keyboard jockeys, naysayers, spreading misinformation about awakening, or are not doing the work.
</p>

<p>
	I have less tolerance for such things these days.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you're here with an open mind to learn, that you are non-ideological, and that you are doing the work.
</p>

<p>
	As much as I like keeping this forum democratic and open to all, the reality is that far too many people come in here who aren't doing the work and just distracting others from doing the work.
</p>

<p>
	These are always difficult determinations to make, but without it the quality of the forum goes too low.
</p>

<p>
	Most of you are okay, so don't worry. It's usually only a tiny handful of people who consistently drag things down.
</p>

	Just want to remind everyone to be aware of how self-bias distorts all of your logic, arguments, and justifications.
</p>

<p>
	Just notice this meta point before you get losts in endless selfish debate.

<p>

<title>Is refusing to pay tax to a corrupt gvmt a corrupt behaviour?</title>

<p>
	Think of it this way, if not paying taxes became widely adopted, your society would devolve into barbarism.
</p>

<p>
	As bad as the corruption might be now, remind yourself how much worse it can be by reading in the history books of how bad things were in the past.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, by not paying taxes (even to a semi-corrupt government) you add to the devilry.

<title>Mushrooms Triggered This Guy's Schizophrenia</title>

<p>
	Having a bad trip also doesn't mean schizophrenia.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of people simply have bad trips and have no clue how to process or interpret what happened. So they might reach for a label like "crazy", "schizo", "psycho" or whatever. Doesn't mean much.
</p>

<p>
	I'll tell you this much: if an ordinary person experienced some of my recent awakenings out of the blue, without years of conceptual foundation and inner work, they would surely think they went insane and they would check themselves into a hospital and ask for meds to get back to normal.
</p>

<p>
	That's how radical awakening can be. I smile and laugh about it only because I've done so much work to understand and embrace it. And even so, it doesn't always leave me smiling and laughing. Sometimes it's scary and hard.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Those finite parts are humans, animals, objects, etc. Anything material.
</p>

<p>
	Distortion is automatically created as soon as anything finite comes into being.
</p>

<p>
	It's like polarizing white light into all the colors of the rainbow. None of them are as whole as the white light from which it came because the white light contains the whole rainbow.

<p>
	If there is even a hint of doubt, you're gay or at least bi.
</p>

<p>
	When you are fully straight, there is no hesitation whatsoever. You see a hot girl, you want to fuck her brains out within seconds.
</p>

<p>
	And naked men are like invisible to you. Your mind totally filters them out a irrelevant. When you watch porn you don't even see the man.
</p>

<p>
	You also have no fear or doubt about being gay. It is a silly question to even consider because you like pussy so much.
</p>

<p>
	Don't beat yourself up for being gay. Love what you love. The only one judging you is yourself.

<p>
	Fear is the only thing holding you back from God.
</p>

<p>
	Let it go.
</p>

<p>
	Replace all fear with love.
</p>

<p>
	This is the only thing your growth as a human boils down to. You were born to learn how to love. That is God's gift to you. God is trying to share it's Love with you. Do you dare allow it?
</p>

<p>
	What is it going to take for you to Love? That is life's only question to you.

</p>

<p>
	Try again, but be serious about your contemplation.

</p>

<p>
	If you can't have a spiritual insight on mushrooms, I don't know how to help you.
</p>

<p>
	If you want serious nondual states without psychedelics, you must do at least week-long retreats. The kinds of nondual states I speak from are not at all easy to access for most people. This is just a brutal fact. Otherwise this knowledge would be common place, and it's anything but.
</p>

<p>
	There is a reason people become monks. That's basically the only way to access the highest levels of consciousness without psychedelics.

			So what would letting go of a belief that science is true look like? Is saying science is not true letting go of the belief? Or is that just another belief?

<p>
	No, it's not as simple as dropping one or two beliefs. It's all intertwined with your whole state of being. There is no clear or simple way to drop science because it forms the foundation of your sense of reality.
</p>

<p>
	But if you take something like a psychedelic, you can see in one feel swoop how limited science is and see reality without it.

It serves the role of keeping the self alive.
</p>

<p>
	If you ever wonder why a thing exists, the answer, almost always, is survival.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Have you tried the you-die technique?
</p>

<p>
	Yeah... you best stay away from psychedelics if you are so fearful.

Of course this is deeply intertwined with your whole emotional system and even what you think of as your body.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, karma is what stymies Self-Love. Karma is like the clouds that obscure the sun which always shines.
