			But sometimes the present moment is full of suffering which has nothing to do with my mind - there is simply a feeling that exists that I can't seem to change, no matter how present I am
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, this is false. Look carefully at the present moment. It has no suffering in it.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is ALL mind. Stop fucking around, stop playing mind games, and observe how your mind is creating suffering. You ARE doing it! Notice this. Your mind is subtly interpreting and projecting negative meaning onto the present moment. You must look carefully to spot yourself doing this. From now on, every time you feel bad, you ask yourself "How am I creating this feeling? What must I believe to feel this way? What must I think to feel this way?"
</p>

<p>
	I can tell you exactly what happened to you. You got lucky and caught a solid glimpse of the Ox because my video blindsided your ego. It hit you out of blue, thus bypassing many egoic defense mechanisms. But your mind did not have a solid enough foundation to permanently hold this insight. The ego figured out a way to reassert itself and now it has doubled its defense mechanisms. It will not allow another easy, lucky break. Now you're gonna have to work for it.
</p>

<p>
	My guess is you are depressed because you want that enlightenment back and yet you don't know how go get it back. You thought catching a glimpse of the Ox was gonna solve all your problems and make life peachy without any serious spiritual work. And now you are starting to see that was just a fantasy. This is why you're depressed.
</p>

<p>
	But the truth is, you just got lucky. It was never really gonna hold because you have not done almost any work decontructing that big fat ego. You cannot be enlightened and maintain all of your habitual daily egoic manipulations, beliefs, attitudes, etc. All of that needs to be broken down piece by piece. You need to undo yourself and your life. The way you carry yourself every minute of every day IS ego! All of your emtional reactions and thought patterns must be purified through patient observation and contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of enlightenment as a magic pill. You must also become deeply conscious of your daily actions, thoughts, and emotions. Enlightnement is only likely to stick if your entire mind is deconstructed. So cheer up and begin that procees.
</p>

<p>
	Cheer up because you were even so lucky as to get a 10 day glimpse. That takes most people YEARS of work. You got it for free.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, finding God and then losing God is very frustrating. But also totally normal and common in this work. Awaking up is not like flipping a light switch, it's more like a kid playing with a light switch, flickering it on and off many many times.
</p>

<title>The End of the Game: Deconstructing the Portals to the Absolute</title>

<p>
	What people fail to get is that consciousness isn't a thing, it is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	If you think of consciousness as a thing, as a substance, as experiential phenomena, as form, or as a state, then it will seem that there is something prior to consciousness. But really there is not. If you hold that there is 1) consciousness, and 2) something prior to it, that's two things! Which is duality.
</p>

<p>
	Regardless of which labels you wish to use, in the end your ultimate understanding of reality better contain only 1 thing! Otherwise it's still a subtle duality.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing is to realize ONENESS, and why it cannot be anything but ONE.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you choose to call that ONE is then a matter of style.
</p>

<p>
	"Consciousness" and "awareness" are very tricky words. Be careful what you assume about these words. Consciousness and awareness are not what you assume they are. You will only appreciate that at the moment of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help suss out what consciousness really is and how it behaves.
</p>

<title>N,N-DMT rectally</title>

<p>
	You would want to use a salt form, not freebase. Most N,N-DMT is freebase. But I have seen salt versions of it.
</p>

<p>
	If your N,N-DMT is unspecified, it's freebase. You have to go out of your way to find salt.
</p>

<p>
	The dose would also be significantly larger than 5-MeO-DMT. It will defintely be less comfortable sticking 100mg+ of chemical in your ass.

</p>

<p>
	Last year's BitCoin bubble was a stage Orange phenomenon. But of course there is more to BitCoin than speculation.

And don't forget the most important thing you know and love: yourself!
</p>

<p>
	Nothing you know about yourself is real. It's all a costume. Even the idea that you were born, is a story. You were never physically born. You arose as the story of you. One day the thought appeared: "I was born" and because this thought was never questioned, it became the basis of your entire reality. Then to that core fiction you slowly added all the rest of that you think of as yourself and your persona. In childhood, in school you built up the story of yourself and the world.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, fear, vulnerability, hurt, sadness... all of those are tools of the ego-mind to prevent self-reflection. It's okay to feel whatever feelings arise. But do notice, they are yet more manipulations. Manipulations on top of manipulations.
</p>

<p>
	Consider, if all your manipulations stopped, you would cease to exist. Which would be enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	All this is a lot to stomach. Stay with it. It will be worth it in the end.
</p>

<title>The dark side of meditation (having a proper theoretical foundation)</title>

<p>
	I have said exactly the same thing in my Becoming A Zen Devil video and The 10 Ox Herding Pictures video.
</p>

<p>
	Most people half-ass spirituality due to piss-poor theoretical foundation. This is common with shallow Neo-Advaita style teachings.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to theory, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. But I would rather have too much than too little.
</p>

<p>
	Technically, a Zen Devil is one who practices Zen with no theory.

		</p>

		<p>
			How can I contemplate this? (As in what specific questions can I ask)
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To be clear, this is nothing against you, or particular to you. This is the entire dynamic of life: using stories, concepts, and emotions to manipulate yourself into staying alive. This is what survival is all about. So whether you have dreams or don't, you're doing it. Whether your thoughts and emotions are positive or negative, you're doing it. Even when you feel happy or excited, it's a subtle egoic manipulation. The ego has co-opted the entire experience of life and turned it into a means towards self-perpetuation.
</p>

<p>
	Unraveling the inner workings of the ego-mind is a complex and tricky affair. A good place to start is to notice how every thought, every emotion, and every reaction you have, all day long, is somehow a subtle manipulation of yourself to act the way the devilish ego-mind wants. It takes a lot of patient observation of your thoughts, emotions, and reactions to start to see the full scope of what ego is doing. So start observing.
</p>

<p>
	You can contemplate questions like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Why do I have emotions at all? What is the point of them?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do I have thoughts at all? What is their purpose?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do I hold somethings as positive and others as negative? What is the point of positive and negative?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why am I motivated to do the things I do? What is the point of motivation and why does it exist?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do I hold some things as meaningful while others not? What is the point of meaning? Why do I create it?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Of course the ego-mind will vehemently resist and deflect all such questioning. Your survival agenda does not want to be questioned.
</p>

<p>
	Start looking at EVERYTHING that transpires in your experience of life as a deliberate egoic self-manipulation. Everything in your experience at all times is the ego trying to survive. This survival is not merely about physical life and death, it's extremely sophisticated. What's being survived in not a physical being, but a conceptual construct: the story of YOU.
</p>

<p>
	You -- the ego -- is like a giant living story which is writing itself every minute of its life. Any interference with this writing is perceived as threatening and therefore demonized and rejected.
</p>

Assume for a moment that you can be equally wealthy and successful no matter which career on Earth you pick. Which would you pick?
</p>

<p>
	Do that!
</p>

<p>
	In order to determine this, you really have to be able to step outside your cultural programming and various pragmatic fears that will arise. The fear is clouding your judgment, drowning out your heart's inner guidance.
</p>

<p>
	The heart knows what it wants, but the ego is too scared to listen. The counter-intuitive move here is to listen to your heart despite the fear, trusting that there is a higher intelligence at work.
</p>

<p>
	The more seriously you listen to your fears vs your heart, the more miserable, depressed, and regretful you will be in life, no matter how much money or success you achieve. It could even end up destroying your mental and physical health in the long-run. So don't take this lightly.
</p>

<p>
	Dare to live life offensively rather than defensively. Especially if you're young.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Why might Being be unmodelable?

<p>
	That's usually how it goes.
</p>

<p>
	That's a glimpse of the Ox's tail. An important milestone but far from the end.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind is not prepared to handle the magnitude of what it discovers. That takes much more work. The ego-mind has to be slowly deconstructed piece by piece so that it's capable of staying in the light of nondual consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot stabilize in nondual consciousness and maintain all of your old devilish egoic modes of thinking, reacting, judging, interpreting, etc. It really helps to pull out a journal and start deconstructing your deepest beliefs about life, yourself, and reality.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Infinity and the present moment are real we might say, since they are Absolutes.
</p>

<p>
	But you are not conscious of Infinity nor even the present moment right now. So as far as you're concerned, nothing you know is real. Accessing the real takes a lot of mindfulness practice. Right now you are lost in the conceptual fantasies and projections of your own mind.
</p>

<p>
	Try becoming conscious of what the present moment is, minus all of your mental projections, meanings, beliefs, assumptions, interpretations, stories, judgments, emotions, etc. Try to "feel" what that is. Try to notice that NOW is an Absolute. It is not inside of time (time is a concept). NOW is prior to time. Time occurs inside of NOW. But what is NOW? Take a close long look. After all, it's always NOW!
</p>

<p>
	And Infinity is precisely identical to what is happening right NOW.
</p>

<title>My disagreement with Leo Gura on the direction of self-actualization</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14400-orpheusnovum/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14400" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14400-orpheusnovum/" rel="">@OrpheusNovum</a> You are REALLY lost in concepts.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you said above is a conceptual fantasy that your mind constructed. Time, space, physics, objectivity, depression, body, mind, inner, outer, other people, nihilism, solipsism, Aristotle, Nietzsche, ancient Greece -- are all mental fabrications.
</p>

<p>
	If you think Actualized.org is "nihilistic" or "solipsistic" you are really not understanding nonduality, spirituality, or consciousness yet.
</p>

<p>
	Neither focusing on the mind or the body is the real solution. What is necessary is to self-reflect and become more conscious. Consciousness is neither inner nor outer, neither mind or body. What you call "the body" is really just another aspect of your mind. And the entire domain of mind is unreal anyways.
</p>

<p>
	More practically-speaking, if you're new to this work (and it's obvious you are given what you wrote), nothing I say is against the body per se. If you are stuck in depression and you want to use a body-based approach for breaking out, like Hatha yoga, gym, cleaning up your diet, going out to nightclubs with your friends, starting a business, going mountain-climbing, etc. -- that can be a useful approach. But in the end it will not be a root solution to depression because depression is deeply rooted in your metaphysical disconnection from consciousness & being. No amount of body work will solve that. No amount of success will solve that. For that, you must deeply investigate the inner workings of your own mind and your entire identity.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest work you can do it is done in solitude sitting on a cushion. But this is advanced work. Most people are not yet ready to do that. They need a lot of external actions first. And that's okay. I have nothing against taking external action. I spent many years taking external actions. But nowadays I'm at the point in my own development where I mostly care about internal actions. Pretty much all of your external actions are driven by ego, and this is the root problem. You are not going to solve that problem through more external action. But this is not to say external actions are somehow bad. In practice most people need to take a lot of external action when getting started with personal development.
</p>

<p>
	Not only is objectivity not necessary, it is impossible! There is no such thing! You made it up.
</p>

<title>Authentic Orange Spirituality</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/30594-authentic-orange-spirituality/?do=findComment&amp;comment=355888</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/8864-hero-of-time/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="8864" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/8864-hero-of-time/" rel="">@Hero of Time</a> Well, firstly you should know that the stuff you were doing at Blue which you call "spirituality" was mostly fantasy, group-think, & egotism, not genuine spirituality. So very little is actually lost by letting all that go aside from your ego taking a beating (which is precisely spiritual!).
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, don't wait to reach some Spiral stage to do genuine spirituality. You can begin it at any time (if you dare).
</p>

<p>
	For example, you could go take a psychedelic tomorrow and experience God in 30 minutes. No need to wait. And that's just one simple example.
</p>

<p>
	And finally, for me stage Orange "spirituality" felt a bit like recognizing the wonders of the universe through science and rationality. This is pretty weak when compared to genuine spirituality, but it can be exciting. Most great scientists become scientists because science is their way of doing spirituality (connecting with the wonder of nature & existence). They just aren't conscious of this yet. If you look at someone like Neil DeGrasse Tyson that's what he's doing every time he speaks publicly: he's scratching his own spiritual itch, via science.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is really nothing other than the exploration of yourself, the exploration of the universe, the taking in of nature in a conscious & truthful way. You are God exploring itself. The big problem with stage Blue is that it prevented you from ACTUALLY exploring yourself. Now you are free to go explore and see what can be discovered.
</p>

<p>
	Don't use Spiral Dynamics to limit yourself. You can go straight for Turquoise teachings right now! You might not be able to stomach or understand them, but you also might! So it's worth a shot. You could start doing Kriya yoga tomorrow and see huge shifts in consciousness within 3-6 months. It's not guaranteed, but you won't know till you try.
</p>

	The Truth can seem negative from the ego's POV because it is equivalent to death. It's a big mindfuck which sends most ego's reeling back to the dysfunctional comforts of unconscious living.
</p>

<p>
	No, my only regret is that I didn't awaken sooner and that I am still not fully awake.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening obliterates the notion that anything could be "negative". Negativity is not real. Neither is fear, nor death.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing you want in life is awakening. You just don't know that yet.

<p>
	That is possible, but you will remain clueless about the domain of psychedelics and what they can or cannot do for you.
</p>

<p>
	The core problem here is that you are judging a thing (assuming what it can or cannot do for you) without any direct emprical evidence.
</p>

<p>
	It's a kin to a white person saying: "I don't want to talk to black people because they have nothing to offer me." Well, you don't know that until you actually talk to some. You might be pleasantly surprised.

<p>
	That would be 0.0000000000001% of what your happiness would be at the moment of full awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Try to imagine how happy you would feel if realized that death is impossible and that you are immortal and nothing in the universe can ever hurt you and that you personally own every galaxy and all of the stuff in them. And this condition lasts forever.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If you want true happiness, stop thinking with your dick.

<p>
	You are using these scenarios, emotions, stories, and thoughts to manipulate yourself towards "stuff" -- whatever the ego is after.

<p>
	That would be fear.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can certainly have that fear. But truth doesn't care about your fears.
</p>

<p>
	There maybe lots of legitimate fears about flying to the moon. But if you have not flown to the moon, you get no say about what is on the moon. You chose to not experience the moon.
</p>

<p>
	And of course all fear stems directly from ego. So you fell into the trap of letting the devil dictate your inquiry into truth. And so the very thing you feared: delusion, you have made real.

<p>
	The basis of all genuine understanding is direct personal experience and investigation. Until you perosnally gain significant experience with psychedelics, you will not understand what the words "psychedelic", or "experience", or "reality" even mean.
</p>

<p>
	1 or 2 trips is also not enough to understand. This will require some serious investigation from you.
</p>

<p>
	Until such time, you can even begin to imagine how little you understand.
</p>

<p>
	If you are too lazy or scared to investigate this domain of life, that's on you. Then you have chosen personal comfort over truth.
</p>

<p>
	Since you do not know what truth is, you also do not know where truth could be found.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	The realization of nonduality is an extremely radical shift. Really, your old life is gone. You are dead at this point, so the question of "function" (survival) is moot. There is nothing left to survive. The game of life is over. You have awoken from survival.
</p>

<p>
	Consider, the only reason you worry about survival issues is because you hold the belief that you are alive. What would happen if that belief was surrendered? What would happen if you surrendered all control over your life such that there was zero effort or struggle? What would happen if you became God? Would worry about anything?
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is not a paradigm. It is Absolute.
</p>

I would guess that 90% of people who watch Actualized.org take zero action so they get very little results. It's like watching videos about weightlifting and expecting to get jacked without ever stepping foot in the gym.
</p>

<p>
	This work requires serious intention, motivation, passion, and persistence. By definition, 99% of people will be too lazy and myopic to do it. We are talking about the most advanced wisdom available to mankind. This will not be actualized effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want, you can totally transform your life. The choice is yours. How serious are you gonna take it?
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't take 3 years to see results.
</p>

<p>
	If you were serious, in 3 years you could earn hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash or transcend death using the information I've talked about.
</p>

<p>
	The problem isn't that what I say it too good to be true, it's that it's so true you'll hardly believe it when you see it.

<p>
	Probably not in practice.
</p>

<p>
	Careful not to get fixated on being perfectly developed. This is just more ego. Just focus on becoming more conscious one bit at a time and enjoy life. Do not make personal development a mission. The mission is to enjoy life, not to be working on yourself forever.

<p>
	Self/other is a duality, which means it must ultimately collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Those people you call "other" are really just facets of yourself in the same way that all actors in a movie are all one movie.
</p>

<p>
	There exists nothing but YOU. But not the personal ego you, the Cosmic You. You as the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	Look at another human being in the eyes and realize they are you. Don't think about it. Actually try it.
</p>

<p>
	This is best realized on a psychedelic. Your ordinary mode of consciousness is too weak to see it in most cases without massive concentration work.
</p>

<p>
	This is untrue. Don't limit yourself with such kinds of black & white beliefs.

<p>
	Programming is a solid way to earn a living, but there are many other ways, many better ways. You can basically create whatever career you want if you apply yourself seriously to it.

</p>

<p>
	All cults create an evil "other" to fight against. This allows the ego to feel good about itself, thus avoiding self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
	Self-righteousness is a dead giveaway of egoic behavior.
</p>

<p>
	When you are deeply conscious of Truth and Being, you will not act self-righteously or judgmentally. Judgment automatically disconnects you from Truth.

<p>
	The ego loves to assume it is already fully developed. That conveniently means no more work is required. The ego loves to live in the world of ideals, abstractions, intellectualizations, and soothing fantasies.
</p>

<p>
	You constantly have to give yourself reality-checks in this work. You must be brutally honest with yourself about your deficiencies, limitations, and lack of development. As a rule of thumb you are never as developed or as conscious as you think you are.
</p>

<p>
	It's very easy to listen to advanced stages like Yellow and Turquoise and to assume you're already there just because you intellectually understand those stages or you can picture them in your mind's eye. But that's just imagination. That's not the actual level you're acting from on a daily basis. Most of your daily actions probably stem from much lower levels like Red, Blue, Orange.
</p>

<p>
	A very helpful exercise is to monitor all of your thoughts on any given day and analyze what percentage of your thoughts are stemming from which color stage? How much time do you spend thinking about money, sex, power, fear, selfish needs, dogma, judgment, anger, etc? Probably 90%+ How much time do you spend in systems thinking, metaphysical contemplation, unconditional love, or solving global problems? Probably less than 1%.
</p>

Which then creates a toxic collective ego.
</p>

<p>
	Of course collective ego also loves to disable transparency. For example, CIA secret torture programs and NSA wiretapping thrive on lack of transparency, so they cannot be held accountable. And that's when evil happens.
</p>

<p>
	The individual ego off-loads responsibility onto the collective ego, and the collective ego off-loads responsibility onto the individual ego in a game of phone-tag. You see the ego's game? It always points the finger at someone else. That's how the devil operates because the devil cannot ever stand looking in the mirror -- because then he'd see his own devilish face, which would contradict his self-image of being an angel. The devil always thinks he's an angel and refuses to see any evidence to the contrary -- therein lies the devilry.

Go watch some Matt Kahn videos and practice some self-love and self-acceptance. You cannot change your life from a position of self-flagellation and self-hatred. Well, you can, but it's gonna be very ugly.
</p>

<p>
	Being harsh with yourself just tends to heap ego on top of ego, problem on top of problem.
</p>

<p>
	Slow down, collect yourself, find peace in the now, and slowly begin the process of assembling your life, brick by brick. All the resources you need are basically available these days online.

<p>
	Anonymity in large numbers creates a lack of responsibility. Individual responsibility is off-loaded onto someone else and evil behavior becomes normalized: "everyone's doing it, so it must okay for me to do it too."
</p>

<p>
	In small tribes anonymity is impossible. But in a society of millions of people, and online, it's the opening of Pandora's box. When nobody is holding you accountable it's much easier to behave like a devil.

<p>
	Deficiency needs is a good answer, but I would also say lack of familiarity with the Spiral Dynamics model itself, and lack of epistemic inquiry. The dynamics of knowledge (epistemology) needs to be directly explored and contemplated.
</p>

<p>
	Also systems thinking. Seeing the world as a complex web of impersonal inter-related systems. Most problems are systemic problems requiring systemic solutions. Few people look at the world this way. They look at the world too personally, as if the world revolves around them and their judgments, as if the solutions are linear and black & white. Yellow is nonlinear thinking. Most people are highly linear thinkers.

<p>
	Yes, but Green still clings too much to its SJW perspective as being superior.

<p>
	Green is not able to detach enough from its own perspective.

<p>
	That's a solid strategy. I don't recommend working at McDonalds.
</p>

<p>
	But this topic of resources is too detailed and complex to discuss here.
</p>

<p>
	Just by doing some solid googling you can find mostly anything you need. You have to be serious about it though. There are literally 1000s of amazing resources but you're too lazy to use them.

<p>
	Man, for now, I would say just forget about that. Your mind is filled with fantasies of being some crazy Buddha. Don't worry about that for now. Spend the next 5 years just learning how to survive and thrive in America. Then revisit the Buddha issue.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, Buddha was 27 years old when he left behind his life of luxury, success, and family. He had a wife and child. He was experienced with the ways of material living. And then it took him another 6 years to finally get enlightened. So you've got plenty of time. 23 year olds are basically babies. You have virtually no life experience or survival skills. So build those up.
</p>

<p>
	This is not unique to you. Most 23 year olds these days are like this. As was I at that time. You'd be amazed how much can get accomplished in 10 years. Way more than you could image.

</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what medication you're on, you can still mindfully observe and inquire into emotions. Your entire life is run by emotions 24/7. The issue isn't that you have too few emotions, it's that you're totally overwhelmed by them to the point where you cannot even tell where an emotion ends and your life begins.
</p>

<p>
	Observing and deconstructing emotions is very challenging work, for anyone, regardless of medications or not.
</p>

<p>
	You could start by observing every day in which ways you suppress emotions.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to say: "thought and emotions are so impaired that all contact is lost with external reality."
</p>

<p>
	As it turns out, external reality is a thought!
</p>

<p>
	To be lost in a fantasy, thought is not impaired, thought is hyper-active.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of meditation/yoga is to impair thought.

</p>

<p>
	Just make sure you keep yourself grounded in actuality. Be careful not to conflate direct glimpses with your feelings, thoughts, theories, and images of them. The deepest truths are not images.
</p>

<p>
	Distinguish between the creations of your mind (thoughts, stories, images, memories) vs actual BEING. This is paramount. Notice that nothing you think or imagine about the Truth is the Truth.

<p>
	Overall I would put him at Orange/Green. The part in him that I find Yellow is his openmindedness to diverse perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	I mostly used Joe as an example of the multi-perspective aspect of Yellow. But that's far from Yellow's only aspect.
</p>

<p>
	Joe still has a lot of Orange that he needs to transcend.
</p>

<p>
	The deeper I learn about Yellow, the more I see that extremely few people are solidly at Yellow. Yellow is very deep and sophisticated.

</p>

<p>
	Most of what you used to think of as "reality" was just a thought-based fantasy. Including your own birth and the existence of other people.
</p>

<p>
	Hang in there. These kind of insights can be rough. Truth requires acclimation.

Learn to survive in the world a bit more so that you develop a knack for success and getting stuff done. As you meet those lower level needs, you'll be ready to move up into higher needs.
</p>

<p>
	A skyscraper must be built on a solid foundation. Don't worry about spending a few years learning how to do business. Business is important to learn. Practical skills are important to learn. You want to handle all of your survival needs so that then you have lots of free time to delve into spirituality, art, etc. It's kinda hard to do art when you can't pay your bills.
</p>

<p>
	Learning to get practical stuff done is part of your developmental growth. I had to learn a lot of practical stuff before I could get Actualized.org off the ground. Actualized.org runs due to practical know-how, not airy-fairy spiritual ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Go learn to be a programmer or whatever you need to move you along towards your dreams. I learned lots of scripting and programming because it is so useful.

<p>
	The trick when talking about God is that you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. If you say it's just your opinion or belief, that is untrue and gives the wrong impression. If you say that it is Absolute Truth, that makes you sounds like a fundamentalist nutcase, and also gives the wrong impression.
</p>

<p>
	It's like we are afraid to say the truth because we know no one would believe us. So we play coy.

<p>
	Just food for thought.

</p>

<p>
	I noticed you saying several times that you "believe" this.
</p>

<p>
	What is your direct experience of God?
</p>

<p>
	If I was shooting a video like this (and I do have this topic planned for the future as a video), I would make sure to stress that God is not a belief, or a theory, or a speculation, but a direct experience which the viewer can have. This is what's most amazing about God: you can realize it for yourself! This is what most people misunderstand. A newbie watching your video would walk away with the idea that what you're talking about it is just a philosophical theory of God. The viewer would think, "Well, how does this guy know? He's just theorizing. This is just his opinion."
</p>

<p>
	It's absolutely critical to plant the seed in the viewer's mind that consciousness of God is a real thing and requires doing concrete practices. Otherwise God forever remains an idea. The whole point of such a video would be to get people to realize that they must start doing the necessary practices.
</p>

<p>
	Other distinctions which might have been useful are realism vs idealism, and esoteric vs exoteric versions of religion. Really what your video was debunking were the exoteric versions of God. All mainstream religions are exoteric. Most religious people don't even know that esoteric religion is possible.
</p>

<p>
	It's a very tricky topic, so you did a decent job.
</p>

<p>
	The tricky thing about God is, it's both deeply personal and impersonal, encompassing every set of attributes.
</p>

It mostly tests for psychedelic Indoles.
</p>

<p>
	Those other tests are be useful too for filtering out other harmful agents (you don't want to find meth in your psychedelic), but you need a positive test for Indoles.
</p>

<p>
	There is no test kit that's able to distinguish 5-MeO-DMT from other Indoles. And freebase vs HCl is not something you can test with a kit. The kit don't care.
</p>

<p>
	Test kits are not to be fully trusted. Which is why you always want to test new substances with very small doses to verify your batch is what it claims to be.

<title>How evolved is Joe Rogan and people like him?</title>

<p>
	Joe is a decent guy for what he's doing. You just have to understand that his show is not about spirituality or personal development or truth or consciousness or serious science. It's basically about mainstream gossip. It's a gossip show with some tidbits of wisdom. But also a lot of egotistical nonsense. It's not designed to be a spiritual path. It's designed to be fun gossip. And if you think of it on those terms, it's great. Not everything has to be ultra serious and profound.
</p>

<p>
	But if you expect to become deeply woke listening to his show, then you'll be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
	Relative to other talk show hosts, Joe is pretty wise & evolved. But then again, that's not the highest of bars to clear.
</p>

		<p>
			That is not necessarily true. There are different teaching strategies. For example, if someone has an approach like UG Krishnamurti or Karl Renz the "bashing" (or making fun of) includes almost everything and everyone. "Unconditional hate" as Karl likes to say.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is not masterful teaching. That kind of polarized teaching style does a disservice to students, as it makes them ideological and emotionally reactive. Teachers who teach like that are themselves not fully developed & conscious.
</p>

<p>
	I myself have had to back off that style as I become more conscious. It is a disservice to you guys. Because in truth, there is no one to blame for anything. Everyone is doing their best, even terrorists, Nazis, psychopaths, and cult leaders. They cannot help being who they are and the proper response to their situation is understanding and compassion, not hate or ridicule.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I've wanted to shoot a rant video against JP for a long time now. But I hold myself back because I would rather take the high road. Even though a rant video against JP would get me lots of views and clicks and approval -- it would also make you guys more ideological against him and distract from doing the inner work. So I bite my tongue.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the ego's whole game is to get you to avoid doing the inner work by any means possible. So ego loves to externalize the problem and make it about something "out there" -- some teacher, some teaching, some other group of people, some culture war issue, some political scandal, some latest outrage -- anything to avoid self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
	I have no interest in getting into public battles with anyone or defending my work. I just want to work on myself and be creative without any justifications for my work. My work speaks for itself. If you find my work useful, then use it. If not, then leave and pursue other things. Telling me you disagree with my work is unnecessary. I know better than most of you the flaws and limitations of my own work. I don't need guidance from a random cocky Youtuber who does not know anything about me. I get my internal guidance from a much higher quality, non-human source.
</p>

<p>
	And in the end if you feel my guidance is bad or wrong, don't follow me. I am not here to be right, or perfect, or the Buddha, or your daddy figure. From the very beginning the only function of Actualized.org was to catalogue various insights that I have that I find interesting. That's all this is. There is no pretense to Truth in my teachings since all teachings are concepts and by definition partial and untrue.
</p>

<p>
	Anything that you hear me say is ultimately nonsense. It was that way from day one, and it could not be otherwise. From the very beginning my work is was meant to be self-effacing. Like a snake eating its own tail, such that in the end, nothing remains.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's an intuitive high-level hunch based on subtle cues.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, often these people display their egotism in very obvious ways. For example, no serious teacher would make the core of his teaching the bashing of other teachers. That's an obvious red flag. That's ego reaction, not genuine teaching. People who spend a lot of their time and energy criticizing other teachers or teachings automatically reveal their own lack of consciousness, as all criticism is ultimately untenable and absurd. Reality cannot be otherwise, so there is nothing wrong and no one to blame. When you become deeply conscious, the desire to criticize anything falls away entirely, because it is an ego-game.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become of the devil within you, the easier it becomes to spot Zen devils and their tactics. After years of doing this work you will smell ego from miles away because you've studied it so deeply within yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out for people who make a lot of noise and stir up controversy needlessly, over and over again. This is a very popular online marketing tactic of late. People like Trump, JP, Mike Cernovich, Steven Crowder, Alex Jones, Sam Harris, etc. are master manipulators in this regard. Any cult leader wannabe is going to be a master manipulator & bullshit artist.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand the trickeries of running such a community.
</p>

<p>
	I crack down on stuff like this immediately because egos will not hesitate to exploit this community to build their own cults and brands.
</p>

<p>
	People like Rali and TJ turn criticism into a marketing strategy. The strategy is to stir up a fake controversy to gain views and free advertizing. In my book, this is unacceptable. What they are looking for is attention, which is why they are denied any air whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to criticize me or Actualized.org, go for it. I don't care. But I am not going to let you turn it into a marketing strategy, nor will I allow you to poach members to start your own movement or brand because I do not trust your devilish ego to create a non-cult community.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make is they get a little taste of self-actualization or spirituality and then they think they got what it takes to teach or run a spiritual community. But they are so ignorant of the dangers involved.
</p>

<p>
	I take great care to make sure Actualized.org never becomes a harmful ideological organization. People who I judge to be building harmful ideological organizations are not allowed here. 
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing new here. This has happened before and it will happen again. Every year a new Zen devil comes here to start his cult. I spot such devils immediately. I smell them a mile away. I spotted Rali very early on. The trouble is, they cleverly exploit this because a healthy community must allow criticism. So it becomes a PR problem banning such people because it makes me look like an insecure tyrannt. So it's a tricky balance to strike because they will abuse this to craft their marketing strategy.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, if you guys wish to criticize myself or Actualized.org in a serious way, go for it. I will not close such a thread, but if you do it as a marketing strategy or you are doing it from a place of ego as a distraction, then it will be shut down.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with criticism is that the ego loves to use it to muddy up the waters so much that people get lost and confused. It easily becomes a distraction from doing the work. It's so easy to create fake controversy and milk that cow. But even so, criticism and receptivity to feedback is necessary in any healthy community / organization.
</p>

<p>
	So I welcome constructive criticism and feedback which has no ulterior business motive.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Serious business training is never done through books. Books are too cheap for that.
</p>

<p>
	Try taking a $1000 course or $3000 seminar. That's where you'll learn practical stuff. No one is going to put that information into a $20 book.
</p>

<p>
	Serious business advice is very costly. Because if it's any good, it's worth tens of thousands of dollars.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Not in the slightest.
</p>

<p>
	But I did have a powerful vision for my life, I was very ambitious, and I was following my heart. Which is really all that matters.
</p>

<p>
	You are young. You've got many years to put all of those things in place. Obviously don't waste time sitting around on your ass, but don't panic either.
</p>

<p>
	Right now what you're missing is hope and faith in your vision.
</p>

<p>
	Vision is useless if you don't have rock-solid faith in it. You need to train yourself to believe in it. Visualize it every day with a hopeful vibe. Do not visualize it pessimistically, negatively, full of fear. That is terrible. That is counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	Holding a big vision is not easy. It is scary. Your mind will not believe it is possible. I used all sorts of mind programming techniques to reinforce my vision and overcome various doubts. But the most important thing is HEART! You must have HEART! That is what carries you through everything. Your life purpose must be non-negotiable. You are doing it no matter what. There should be no option for failure because you already know there is nothing else you'd rather do.
</p>

<p>
	There will hundreds of doubts in this journey. You have to really cultivate hope. Not in luck, but in your hard work. Your vision will get actualized through honest labor.
</p>

<p>
	And remember, a big vision requires lots of patience. You don't need to be Buddha by next month. Recalibrate your exceptions and split your vision up into smaller chunks, so you are not evaluating your progress based on whether you are like Ralston or Buddha. That may not happen for 40 years. And that's okay, you don't need that to enjoy your life.
</p>

	Discipline yourself to do the work.

<p>
	Tripping alone is my fave.
</p>

<p>
	125ug of LSD is about as powerful as 2-3g of dried mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Of course potencies can vary. A lot of LSD dosages are exaggerated. So if your source isn't good, a 125ug dose could actually be 70ug, which would be a weak trip. 125ug is a nice solid trip for me, but still very managable, still possible to walk around.
</p>

<p>
	At 300ug you probably wouldn't be able to walk.

For how long? How seriously are you doing them?
</p>

<p>
	Nothing else really matters. That is the key. Without serious practices you will never get enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Which teacher you listen to doesn't really matter if you don't have your practices down. And once you have your practices down you hardly need a teacher at all. That is the paradox of spiritual work. No one can do it for you.

But I did not say living on the beach like a bum. I said buying your own land and building a small shack. That is very doable if you save up some money. In Hawaii you can even live off the grid using solar panels and a rainwater catchment tank. Heating and A/C are virtually unnecessary there.
</p>

<p>
	See my Hawaii solo retreat blog videos.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you don't need to slave. Learning how to make money is not hard. There many ways to earn six figures per year and enjoy the process. You just need a vision to do it. You can't be doing it out of a desire to become a bum. Cultivate a desire to genuinely contribute to humanity. It is so much more fulfilling and pays well when properly designed.
</p>

<p>
	Learn some business, sales, and marketing skills. This is easily acheieved online through courses, workshops, audios, and books.
</p>

<p>
	You also need a plan for getting old. Your health will worsen and so will your ability to work. Healthcare ain't cheap. Don't take stuff like healthcare for granted. Without government you'd probably die in your 50's or 60's due to lack of healthcare, disablity, etc.

</p>

<p>
	The solution is to have it.
</p>

<p>
	This can be done easily with 1 hour using psychedelics. Which is precisely why they are such an important tool. Advanced practitions do not need psychedelics because they are aleady had many mystical experiences and are fully bought in. Newbies need psychedelics to show them what they are missing, what it would take them 10 years of harcore practice to glimpse.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the scientific way of finding God. They are totally empircal and easily replicatable. Clinically proven beyond any placebo or doubt. That's what makes them such useful tool. Never before in human history has there such an easy route to spirituality for newbies as with today's modern psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	This issue of doubting mysticism is utterly unneccessary in today's age. You might as well be doubting kangroos. If you doubt so much, why not just go to the zoo and pet a kangroo? It costs $30 and takes 1 hr.
</p>
