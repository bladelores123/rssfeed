			Just because people in positions in power can get away with doing terrible things because they have the protection of certain legalities while regular Joe's don't, it doesn't make the acts any less terrible.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm amazed a systems thinker such as yourself is even interested in using such logic semantics as a defense.
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes I appreciate they are in unique situations and their hands are tied, but you have to understand the reason people even use such language as "criminal" (even if it is recklessly applied sometimes) is to push back and challenge the systems that justify and rationalize those acts, and to expand our standards of what is acceptable behavior and what isn't.

<p>
	Presidents make all sorts of decisions that people will disagree with it. That does not a criminal make.
</p>

<p>
	My defense is not semantic. It's fundamental. Presidents are given serious life and death situations and decisions to deal with. If you start calling them criminals willy-nilly because they seem too harsh, that's your misunderstanding of the challenges and complexities of governing a nation of 330 million people.
</p>

<p>
	You can question and criticize their decisions without resorting to falsehoods and hyperbole.
</p>

<p>
	You can disagree with Obama without calling him a criminal. Calling him a criminal weakens your argument by making you look ignorant, reactionary, and sloppy.
</p>

<p>
	Making life and death decisions for a president is not a crime. It's the job!

<p>
	To call a president or politician a criminal is silly because the job itself just has serious consequences no matter who holds it.
</p>

<p>
	If you think Obama and Biden are criminals, you have no appreciation of what a truly corrupt person in such a position of power would be like.
</p>

<p>
	A few drone strikes is peanuts in the grand scheme of things and does not a criminal make. Obama is probably the least criminal a politician as has ever held serious office.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful with your liberal fantasies of how politicians and presidents should be angels. They can't be angels because they are in the business of fighting off monsters and devils. An angel would never get the job.
</p>

<p>
	When you are president, even a small decision could easily end up hurting or killing thousands of people. And often times your decisions are like this:
</p>

<p>
	Plan A: 1,000 people die
</p>

<p>
	Plan B: 100,000 people die
</p>

<p>
	There is no Plan C.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to Silicon Valley. They are Green on social/culture issues, and Orange on economic and metaphysical issues.
</p>

<p>
	A capitalist is much more threatened by relinquishing Orange values on economics, metaphysics, and epistemology than they are in being pro-gay, pro-women, pro-minority. It doesn't cost Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Tesla, etc much to be Green on social/cultural issues. But it costs them tens of billions to give up Orange economics.
</p>

<p>
	The engine that runs most universities is still Orange capitalism/materialism. With a Green outer shell.

			Interesting idea. I don't know of many lower-ranked employees who would like to share the loss margins if the higher-ups mess up though. Would this require them to invest in the stocks of their company too?
		</p>

		<p>
			It will take immense levels of trust between people. It could work. I'd say it's worth a shot.

<p>
	I think the most you'd stand to lose is your share of future profits and your job.
</p>

<p>
	The low level employees would not invest their own money. They would be given the share of ex-employees who left the company.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the company would constantly be reallocating shares based on who's working, how much work they do, and how valuable their work is. If you leave the company, you lose all your shares. If the company makes no profit, you gain no bonus, but you still get a base salary. If the company goes bankrupt you lose your job and your shares.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the point is to make sure that no one who isn't working in the company can buy shares. Only workers should be allowed to have a share of the profits, not outside speculators or Wall Street wolves.
</p>

<p>
	The billion dollar question I have is this: is it possible to entirely abolish Wall Street? Or does Wall Street actually serve a necessary role? Could we construct a society and economy in which Wall Street's role would be made completely obsolete? I'm not sure, but it's a question worth seriously exploring.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it should be obvious now why the people in power absolutely HATE this idea and will do everything in their power not to even consider it as a possibility. Those in power primarily thrive off the labor of others, yet they MUST deny this in their own minds.
</p>

	There are pros and cons to each location. And it depends a lot on where you live. Some cities are great for daygame while others are not. Some clubs and bars are shit, some are amazing. You can't beat a Vegas nightclub pool party for game. XS on Sunday nights in the spring and summer is just paradise. Los Angeles, Miami, NYC is great for daygame.

<p>
	I think it could work the way pirate ships worked. The pirate ship was basically a co-op model. But it wasn't flat. It had hierarchy and strong leadership, but every pirate, even the greenhorn, would get a percentage share of all the loot.
</p>

<p>
	So, the captain might get 1/3 share.
</p>

<p>
	His lieutenants might get 1/15th share.
</p>

<p>
	And the lowest greenhorn sailor might get 1/100th share.
</p>

<p>
	As you rise up the ranks and gain more experience and responsibility, your share increases.
</p>

<p>
	This all basically boils down to how ownership and spoils get distributed.
</p>

<p>
	The federal gov could basically mandate that each corporation with over 10, 50, or 100 employees must adopt this share model or face heavy fines/taxes.

<p>
	1) Green must build on top of the accomplishments of Orange, not outright reject them. The difficulty is figuring out which aspects of Orange to ditch and which to keep. There is no simple answer to that question.
</p>

<p>
	2) Just cause it's Green doesn't make it more effective. Green's metrics for success are different than Orange. Green is more about relationship and community than raw productive output. Hippies aren't exactly well-known for their effectiveness. But, hey, maybe that's a better way to measure biz effectiveness.

<p>
	I honestly don't know if it would be a disaster or an triumph. It's hard to predict. It needs empirical testing.
</p>

<p>
	The whole trick with new social systems is that no one can really predict ahead of time whether they will work. It requires experimentation and fine-tuning in an evolutionary manner.

	That is the case with any chemical. Psychedelics affect people very differently.

<p>
	It's all one big arc. So yes.
</p>

<p>
	Even just with using one substance, your first 5-MeO trip will be very different from your 20th. The chemical is less of a factor than your mind's development is.

<p>
	1) They promise you a quick and easy awakening.
</p>

<p>
	2) They don't understand crazy levels of awakening at all, since they have not attained them.
</p>

<p>
	So they're misleading you in two ways at once. They both oversell and undersell Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not talking about changes in character. I'm talking about consciousness.

	They love to exaggerate that.

<p>
	It's marketing BS.
</p>

<p>
	Don't trust any neo-advaitan who claims enlightenment can be had quickly and easily. It's fools gold. It will not work. They cherrypick their successes and bury their failures. It's very dishonest and manipulative, giving newbies a false sense of hope.
</p>

<p>
	It took me a long time to figure out their game. Awakening is not binary.

	There are different kinds of populism at different stages.
</p>

<p>
	Green populism is very different from Blue populism.
</p>

<p>
	Blue populism is nationalistic, ethnocentric, racist, xenophobic, anti-immigrant, anti-gay, anti-minority, anti-feminist, anti-relativist. Fascistic.
</p>

<p>
	Green populism is globalist, inclusive, socialistic, pro-immigrant, pro-gay, pro-minority, pro-feminist. Bernie Sanders & AOC.

</p>

<p>
	Yeah, the Trump admin is full of libertarian-leaning folks, and yet Trump would not hesitate to become an authoritarian. That's the trick. You assume there is some kind of integrity to these right-wing ideologies when there isn't. They are opportunistic, selfish, and power-hungry. As the naive libertarians weaken the state, that allows an authoritarian boss to swoop in and fill the power vacuum. Libertarians become the useful idiots of serious fascists and authoritarians.

</p>

<p>
	The point is for you to understand how the ego-mind justifies selfish behavior due to relativity of morals.

<p>
	Once you've attracted her, you will have a lot of leeway. You can be nice or you can be an asshole and she will stick around in both cases most of the time.
</p>

<p>
	But if you are an asshole, eventually she will leave after much suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why ethics are so important. Women are too easily exploited this way by guys. They fall for assholes too easily. Guys need to be taught how not to mistreat women.

<title>Vaush on Fascism</title>

<p>
	Careful though about framing this as the good guys vs the enemy. The problem is that Vaush is polarizing his listeners too much, making them see the right-wing as "the enemy". This will make it impossible to govern half the country.
</p>

<p>
	Of course most right-wingers are not consciously, intentionally fascist. But their ideology makes it easy for them to become soft supports of fascist leaders. Trump has a 90% approval rating in his own party, which is a very troubling sign. So while most right wingers will never explicitly say they support fascism, many of them can be fooled into voting a fascist into office because they have nationalist sympathies and the culture wars can be used to trick them into voting for those who will own those scary crazy Libs. 
</p>

<p>
	Fascists love to pander to and stoke up the natural ethnocentric fears that roughly half of any given country has. Propaganda channels like Fox News will stroke up these fears to the point where otherwise moderate folks become confused and start acting to defend against those fears.
</p>

Slavery was practiced locally by most peoples all over the world. And of course Africans enslaved each other too.
</p>

<p>
	Go read Wikipedia article on the history of slavery.

<p>
	So now you understand how a slaverowner feels justified in keeping slaves.
</p>

<p>
	Slavery is purely practical. No one engages in slavery to be deliberately cruel. Free labor is simply a highly practical thing.

<title>Vaush on Fascism</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	So I've been listening a lot to Vaush over the last week and although he is overly edgy and overly stuck in Green, he's got some pretty astute and brilliant insight into certain aspects of politics.
</p>

<p>
	I found the following video particularly insightful:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XI9QlY_nNo?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Vaush is making me think more deeply about what fascism really entails and how sneaky it is. And while I still think he over-uses that term, I'm also starting to see an undeniable slippery slope between right-wing populism and fascism.
</p>

<p>
	Is there really such as thing as right-wing populism which will not devolve into xenophobia, racism, and authoritarianism? I'd like to think so, but I'm not as certain of that as I used to be. These new right-wing populists can be very sneaky with their messaging. After all, if someone was a true populist why wouldn't he support someone like Bernie or AOC? Right-wing populists are nationalists first and populists second. Otherwise they'd be left-wing populists.
</p>

<p>
	Anyways... just some food for thought.
</p>

<p>
	If you overlook Vaush's excessive edginess and hyperbole, he has some of the most sophisticated political analysis I've seen on YT.
</p>

<p>
	You are literally saying that higher stages of the Spiral are more dangerous than lower stages.
</p>

<p>
	You saying that -- is what is most dangerous, as you give defense to nationalist propaganda during a time of rising nationalism.
</p>

<p>
	Left wing ideology will never be as dangerous as right wing ideology.

<p>
	While it's true that women have fears of sexual assault and so-on that men do not, it's absurd to say that women fear more than men.
</p>

<p>
	Most men are full of fear. A woman doesn't even understand what fear is until she's experienced what it's like for a guy to cold approach a hot girl and try to attract her.
</p>

<p>
	Most men are super insecure and fearful. Fear is fundamental to all living organisms. Women do not have some special monopoly on fear.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is fundamental to the ego-mind. So it's not about male or female. The more ego the more fear.
</p>

	LP by day, pickup by night.
</p>

<p>
	Move to a bigger city when you can afford it.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, pickup doesn't have to take up your whole day. You can go out for 2-3 hours every Fri, Sat, Sun. You can do day game in the afternoons on weekends.

<p>
	There's no solution to this other than finding another girl.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is not a conscious choice. You do not choose what you get attracted to.
</p>

<p>
	She herself cannot satisfy her own standards for you. She will certainly not be turned on by any random guy.
</p>

<p>
	It's your responsibility as a man to screen girls hard right off the bat to meet your attractiveness standards. Stop settling for mediocre girls. By not screening harder you are doing a disservice to the girl, since you won't be passionate about her.
</p>

	This assumes so much.

<p>

<p>
	None of this is the case without education, training, and infrastructure.

<p>
	I'm open to it. We need to move in that direction. But unlike most socialists I'm not naive enough to think that it will all just auto-magically work without leadership. Co-ops will need leadership.
</p>

<p>
	We need more co-ops, but we need more conscious, visionary leadership too.

	I'm extremely skeptical of any flat-hierarchy organizations. If they worked, they would have been done from day one. The problem is they are inefficient and directionless. Design by committee doesn't work so well. Majority of people are lazy, ignorant, stupid, and without vision or ambition.

	If 40mg vaped didn't show him God, plugging won't either. He clearly has a massive tolerance to it.

I don't see the appeal of that.
</p>

<p>
	I'd rather take a pure clean hit of DMT via a simple oil pipe. Oil pipe works excellent. Yes, it can be fucking intense if you dose too high. So dose low. You can always redose and keep a steady high going.

Libertarians usually don't give a damn about racism, since most of them lean right-wing. And a libertarian would tend to argue that math and logic are absolute truths since libertarians do not understand relativity.

</p>

<p>
	Thanks for sharing.
</p>

<p>
	A few tips:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Stop using 5-MeO and switch to DMT. If DMT is more profound and mystical for you, why aren't you using it more? You need to find the chem that works for you. If 40mg of vaped 5-MeO-DMT don't clearly show you God, then it's not the right chem for you.
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't hide your stuff in a book. That's the first place anyone would look. Be more clever.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is not as challenging for me as DMT or salvia.
</p>

<p>
	Although by the 25th day of 5-MeO, things got pretty hairy and I was starting to lose my mind.

<p>
	Sure, slaves probably feel oppressed.
</p>

<p>
	But the point is that the slave masters don't feel they are doing anything wrong. They feel entitled to having slaves in the same way that you feel entitled to eating plants and animals. You don't feel you're doing anything wrong when you eat a carrot. Neither does a slave master.

	A) That's still all relative.

<p>
	B) Humans can only raise their consciousness like that through education and cultural evolution, which requires massive social infrastructure. You can't have the majority of humans become conscious enough to realize that slavery is selfish without first building a massive government which educates them about such things and provides them systems, regulations, and controls to meet their selfish needs in more kind ways.

<p>
	Fundamentally, no two communities can remain isolated from each other. It's always only a matter of time before they start to bump into each other, cross-pollinate, and merge.
</p>

<p>
	It is impossible for two villages to simply live near each other without interaction. And much of that interaction will not be voluntary or lovely. Libertarians fundamentally do not understand this.

<p>
	Psychedelics are so powerful that you will never get used to giant doses. You're not going to out-macho psychedelics. They will always kick your ass if you take too much. So be careful. Infinite Consciousness is not a thing to be trifled with.
</p>

<p>
	I find high doses of DMT downright terrifying. It's too much consciousness for a human to handle.

<p>
	We are not going to discuss Red Pill here.
</p>

<p>
	Red Pill will not get you laid, it will just corrupt your mind with negativity and anger.
</p>

<p>
	To get good with women you must be positive and constructive. Blaming women for your problems is the last thing you wanna do. Women are amazing when you learn how to interact with them properly. You should be looking to create win-win situations.

<p>
	Here's a good list of tips for you newbies:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hmfdu7/the_most_common_mistakes_guys_make_in_the_field/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hmfdu7/the_most_common_mistakes_guys_make_in_the_field/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes the best pickup advice you will find written as simple online posts by anonymous guys who clearly hit the field. There's tons of this stuff available online.
</p>

<p>
	Look for guys who sound like they spend a lot of time in the field, and take notes on their tips and top lessons. Then follow those as you hit the field yourself. That's basically how you learn game in a nutshell. It's not very fancy or complicated. You just need to figure out the top 20 or 30 principles and practice them religiously.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most valuable parts of RSD was their forum, with Field Reports and advanced practitioners posting their highest lessons and tips. That alone was enough to learn game. Too bad it's all gone now. But you can find other online sources.
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty easy to see who is more conscious if you are doing consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	Or just rely on Spiral Dynamics as a rough guide.
</p>

<p>
	Of course most people will be biased in favor of their fave candidate.

<p>
	I just intuitively felt the entire pickup culture was low-consciousness and toxic from the moment I visited their forums. But I also knew that they had solid dating advice, and these two things are separate. There is nothing wrong with techniques and theory in itself. It just needs to be used responsibly with compassion for the woman.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to business. You can learn business techniques which can be applied ethically to benefit your customers or unethically to exploit your customers.

<p>
	The deeper issue here is this: you interactions with women need to be obviously charged with sexual intent that if a woman pays you any compliment at whatsoever, she knows she's implicitly asking to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	You need to make it clear with the first 5 minutes of meeting a girl that this is not a friend-to-friend interaction.

<p>
	Julien was a juvenile idiot drunk on the power of RSD culture.
</p>

<p>
	This is the kind of thing I criticized in my A Rant Against The Pickup Community video.
</p>

<p>
	There was a fundamental lack of concern for the woman's feelings within RSD culture. Women were treated as disposable dogs. I clearly saw it as a problem just before this whole debacle with Julien blew up in his face.
</p>

<p>
	It all could have been avoided if Owen put some emphasis on ethics. The selfishness was just off the charts within RSD culture. It became toxic.

	But that's exactly what happens when you democratize and flatten hierarchies, as Green is into doing. You will get a mob rule effect. The mob will require people to conform to its values.

	Even more than that, try to be conscious while in the middle of it. That's what really creates growth.

			You can definitely tell how obsessed he is with game, he even admits it comes from a childhood of verbal abuse From his mother (so now has a need for female validation), being a “nerd” in high school & an analytical mind + an addictive personality, and of course a sex addiction must play a role. That’s why I made it clear you have to make his teachings conscious, people like that will do whatever it takes to get what he wants, I liked his advice as it was very practical with flow charts & what not for every situation/ objection, like you said there’s still things to learn there, I just don’t want to partake in the unethical side of things at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ethical game is certainly harder than unethical game, there’s no debating that, same in business like you said.
		</p>

		<p>
			But, we can still learn things from these people just like we can learn great business practices from unethical ones & apply them in a much more ethical manner <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />

<p>
	Certainly you can learn how to be effective from a sociopath.
</p>

<p>
	I once accidentally bumped into John at Walmart while I was shopping. I had only met him like once before and we didn't know each other well. But he recognized me at Walmart and came to say hello. He immediately pulled out his phone and started showing me pictures of girls he banged the previous night. I thought it was so lame and desperate that he was trying to impress me with his lay count. I think he's on an ego trip.
</p>

<p>
	Come to think of it, every time I bumped into him at the club our brief conversations consisted of him bragging to me about his ever-increasing lay count.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I never got the appeal of having a high lay count. He is obsessed with that shit. I feel sorry for the girls who sleep with him.
</p>

	Just cause he's a sociopath doesn't make him unreal. He certainly gets results. Most sociopaths are highly effective.
</p>

<p>
	Ethical game is harder than unethical game, just like ethical business is harder than unethical business.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, John also got kicked off the RSD forums when he tried to secretly use their forum to steal their clients.
</p>

<p>
	My Rant Against Pickup video was a reaction to this kind of stuff I saw in the community. Many PUAs lack ethics and RSD certainly didn't teach ethics and actually glorified unethical behavior -- creating a toxic combo.

<p>
	Lol. You are confusing things.
</p>

<p>
	The notion of "large" is what is relative. Nothing in the universe is "large" unless you specify some other thing RELATIVE TO which it would be large.
</p>

<p>
	So, for example, if there only existed one object in the universe -- like one elephant -- it would be impossible to say whether it was large or not, since that notion is literally meaningless without some relative comparison.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise, nothing in the universe is bad, or expensive, or upside-down, or ugly, or powerful, or hot, or fast, or heavy unless you compare it next to some other thing.
</p>

<p>
	To put this very broadly: it is impossible for God to know what anything is other than by comparison to something else.
</p>

<p>
	So, God himself cannot tell you how old God is because God is the only thing that exists and therefore there is no outside comparison which it could make to determine its own age. Hence God is timeless and Eternal.
</p>

<p>
	Which is precisely why God is Absolute. And since God is everything, that means everything is Absolute. Which means that the relative and the absolute are identical.
</p>

<p>
	To be frank, plenty of guys do pickup because they just want a bunch of hot sex or because for them it's an ego/power trip. They get drunk off the power they feel from it. This is the shadow side of pickup. It can be very harmful. So be careful. You will meet a lot of damaged, shameless, and egotistical guys within pickup. Don't become like that.

	Careful. John is a straight up rapist. I met him when he was in Vegas 6 years ago. He had a pending rape legal case against him. He takes game waaaaaay too far. He is very coercive with girls. I don't recommend you go down that dark road.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, you want to be careful not to hurt girls in this process. Don't make her regret sleeping with you. And also, don't make pickup look bad by being so hardcore about it.
</p>

<p>
	With great power comes great responsibility. He certainly abuses his power.
</p>

<p>
	He is ripe for a #MeToo takedown.

<p>
	I mean the whole package. The entirety of a girl's value. This includes sexual value, reproductive value, social value, etc. Basically, the needs in you that she satisfies and how well she satisfies them.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously this is relative to every guy. But also, guys have similar needs and desires, thus creating competition for the highest value girls. If she has a perfect pair of tits and a six figure salary, she will be much harder to attract and keep. So you better bring some of your own value to the negotiating table. A girl subconsciously knows her own value.

<p>
	Sure. Most people are just normies.
</p>

<p>
	I'm talking here within the context of transforming yourself with regards to dating and as a man. This is not for everyone.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is right for you only if you want to seriously transform yourself as a man and you want much higher quality girls than you would normally be able to get. If you're just happy with an average girl, then pickup is probably overkill.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be interested in the actual process of it, not just the end result. The learning journey is the best part.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not so fast!
</p>

<p>
	Libertarianism has infected much of the Republican party and their donor class -- because it's so convenient for them. People who's survival depends on the exploitation of others LOVE the libertarian ideology because it weakens the regulations which keep such exploitation in check.
</p>

<p>
	The Trump administration's explicitly stated goal is "the deconstruction of the administrative state", as Steve Bannon put it:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kPFpTergAGQ?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	The problem is that libertarianism rarely exists in its pure form. In the real world it get alloyed with all sorts of conservative ideology such as nationalism and religious fundamentalism.
</p>

<p>
	As we speak the Trump admin is deregulating and privatizing as much of the government as possible, making it easier for the strong to exploit the weak.
</p>

<p>
	"Political termites" is a great phrase from David Cay Johnston:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_IcY5VFPKk?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	So in practice libertarianism becomes the handmaiden of shameless arch-capitalists who stand to gain the most from the exploitation opportunities which libertarianism opens up.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the ego is incredibly ingenious and sneaky. It will use an ideology like libertarianism -- which nominally values non-aggression and consensual agreements -- in order to get rid of the referee, and then use that opportunity to dominate the field. And by the time that happens, it's too late. You're powerless to reverse it.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't ascribe it a conscious malicious motive. It's just part of the the stage Orange worldview.
</p>

<p>
	By definition every ideology serves someone's survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	It's not really propaganda. Milton was true believer. Libertarians are true believers. They are just naive about human nature. They expect everyone to be as ethical as them. And they don't recognize their own devilry.
</p>

<p>
	It's not an accident that many billionaires gravitate towards libertarianism. Of course it's highly convenient for them.

<p>
	Blueprint is very old.
</p>

<p>
	Tyler's free YT videos circa 2010-2014 were the shit. Total game-changer.
</p>

<p>
	Some other coaches I liked:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		David Wygant (daygame)
	</li>
	<li>
		Mehow (he had some of the earliest in-field vids in the industry)
	</li>
	<li>
		David DeAngelo (solid dating theory that's less hardcore than pickup)
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	They are rather old now, but their material was very helpful for me when I started out.
</p>

<p>
	Also research Mystery's original Kino Escalation ladder. That's gold.
</p>

<p>
	You can basically piece together a master map of pickup by studying every coach under the sun. Watch a couple hundred hours of material, take notes, and piece together your own personal map of female attraction.
</p>

<p>
	But be careful. Pickup theory is addictive. You need to go out on the streets to really learn how the theory applies.
</p>

<p>
	Each hour of theory requires like 10 to 100 hours in-field ACTION to learn.
</p>

It's far more profound than that.
</p>

<p>
	If you were Omniscient you would realize that cancer is something you're imagining. You would also realize that you are immortal and that cancer is no threat to you. You would already realize that cancer is Love and that nothing needs to change. You would also realize that God has no control of itself because God is nothing but the highest Love.
</p>

<p>
	God is the realization that there is nothing you can do to change anything. It is TOTAL surrender. What heals you is absolute self-acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	Omniscience is not the knowing of a set of facts. It the realization that you are Infinity.
</p>

<title>Why are you not vegan Leo?</title>

<p>
	I've tried it multiple times but given my thyroid condition, a vegan diet simply does not give me enough energy to function. I would have to be eating every couple of hours not to feel hungry and cold.
</p>

<p>
	And I do not consume any wheat or grain products. Most vegans eat garbage grains to make up the bulk of their calories.
</p>

<p>
	High carb diets do not make me feel good.

<p>
	Facing your fear consciously is where the work happens. If you are merely reacting to fear unconsciously, that won't necessarily grow you.

<p>
	It is uncannily true to what psychedelics do. It's like the mind is struggling to filter out Infinity, so it comes seeping in at the seams.

	Time is purely a function of your current state of consciousness. If your state changes enough, time will cease to exist.

			yeah those ones. Just speaking within story terms, watching a home video is at least a more unified "sequence of events" than two people trying to recount the same story from memory.  It appears to stay the same whether I show the home video to no one, or to hundreds, quite unlike telling a story with words.  Maybe this has nothing to do with time but do you have any thing to say about it? Maybe I'm asking more about recording vs recounting. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well... your consciousness and mind is going through a very complex and elaborate process to link up those images on the recording to your entire view of reality and your mind is positioning those images within a certain mental framework which you call time and your personal story.
</p>

<p>
	This mental process is so sophisticated and complex that it's basically impossible to map out in a logical linear sequence.

<p>
	Well, there's many layers of reasons why not.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in theory it would be nice, but in practice we are all too selfish to sustain it. That would require massive degrees of consciousness, selflessness, and love, which less than 0.0001% of people are currently capable of.

<p>
	We are rapidly raising our collective consciousness when looked at in the geological time scale. But you are looking at this from the tiny time scale of your one personal life.

<p>
	Imagination IS reality.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is however you imagine it is. So if you imagine definite timelines of the entire universe, that's what you create. And if you say you didn't create it, but that it was there before you came along, then that's what you imagine/create.
</p>

<p>
	The key is to understand that YOU ARE FUCKING DOING IT!

<p>
	You don't have to be all that stuff. That stuff is for guys who want HOT girls.
</p>

<p>
	If you want an ordinary, below-average girl, you can get away with not working on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But this forum is fundamentally about becoming the best that you can be. So we are biased in that way. We want more than the average guy here.
</p>

<p>
	But also, becoming good with women and becoming a high-value guy IS just you being you. Assuming you want to be a high-value guy. If you want to be a lazy guy, then do that. In which case why are you reading about dating advice? Dating advice already assumes you want to improve yourself somehow to get a better result.
</p>

<p>
	If you care about attracting high quality women, you must offer her something in return. Otherwise you're basically trying to cheat her.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the real key to pickup is that it's not about tricking a hot girl to sleep with a lame guy. It's about turning a lame guy into a powerful man, and then girls crave that new guy you have become. In this way you aren't cheating the girl, you are actually transforming yourself for her. You are giving her the gift of the best possible you!
</p>

<p>
	All the fucking work I did on myself, I can now happily gift to a woman for her enjoyment. And that is ultimately the greatest joy of the pickup journey: the joy that women get from who you have become. It's like giving a homeless person a million dollars and seeing the smile on his face.
</p>

<p>
	The average guy gifts his girlfriend a turd.
</p>

<p>
	A guy who works on himself gifts his girlfriend the sparkling diamond which he has become.
</p>

<p>
	Your girlfriend doesn't want a diamond around her finger, she wants a diamond between her legs. She wants you to be her diamond.
</p>

<p>
	And how are diamonds made? Under great pressure. The pressure of life experience forges a weak boy into a powerful man. And it is this purification process which you hate when you say, "I hate this".
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course it will massively grow your self-esteem and confidence. Especially in the context of women.
</p>

<p>
	But of course it will not fix all your self-esteem issues automatically. There are many dimensions to self-esteem and confidence which pickup will not touch.

</p>

<p>
	<strong><span style="font-size:72px;">NO.</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	We are not gonna get into the inferiority of race debates on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	If you think some races are fundamentally inferior, this forum is not for you.
</p>

<p>
	Let's try to elevate the quality of our conversations here. Is debating the inferiority of black people a good use of your time?

	What can government do to crub teenage pregnancy??? Nothing? Really??? He doesn't know?
</p>

<p>
	Sex ed, free condoms, birth control
</p>

<p>
	This is the lack of systems thinking and collective responsibility that I was talking about.
</p>

<p>
	And actually, government plays a huge role in making people "virtuous". That is the whole point. Good government can enable the development of virtuous citizens.
</p>

<p>
	Government's not good at doing things? Government does the most difficult task in the world, managing a powerful military. If government can do that, it can do a lot of other stuff effectively. The problem is that people like Rand Paul defund government at every corner so of course it can't be good at doing things then.

<p>
	So... I've gotten some pushback from libertartians that I am strawmanning their arguments. Of course we don't want that. So let's see some real-life self-proclaimed libertarians arguing for their ideology and their policy proposals.
</p>

<p>
	Post video examples here so people can get a true sense of how libertarians think and how my critiques of libertarianism applies to their logic.
</p>

<p>
	Then people can judge for themselves if libertarianism holds any water.
</p>

<p>
	You see... one of the things I made sure to do in my Libertarianism critique is to focus on libertarianism <u>as it functions in the real world</u>, not as it is written about in academic books. What I have found is that while libertarianism may sound reasonable in an academic book, when it is practiced by real people in the real world, it looks far less flattering. That's what you'd expect from an ideology which is highly idealistic and philosophical. The philosophy can look good on paper, but then when you use it to build an actual real-world thing, it turns to shit. Similar to what happened with Communism in the Soviet era. It sounded a lot better on paper than it turned out in practice.
</p>

<p>
	But there's far more to it than that. Even if he works out his fears, thoughts, emotions, etc. It still won't be good enough.
</p>

<p>
	He needs a radical shift in his state of consciousness. Which is either created through: Intense concentration on the NOW, or taking a chemical.
</p>

<p>
	Either way, chemical changes are happening.

	You can think of Consciousness like one of those Transitions Glasses lenses which turns dark when sun shines on it, and turns clear when you go indoors. It's the same lens and it's always NOW, but the question is, is it transparent or opaque? If it's opaque, then you ain't awake, and nothing an awake person says will make sense.

<p>
	No, he just has game and you don't. That's the key difference.
</p>

<p>
	The deceptive part is that when you see really good pickup in action, it doesn't look like pickup. It looks totally natural, such that an on-looker would say, "But that's not pickup, that's just a cool guy being friendly." Exactly! But you have no idea what work is involved in becoming that good. On-lookers will only judge you by the end result. They don't know how many hundreds of sets you bombed with cringe to get to this set.

<p>
	You are in the wrong state.

<p>
	All states happen NOW, but you need the right state. So if you're in the wrong state, NOW won't feel like anything special.

<p>
	EVERY newbie makes this mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Attracting females is deeply counter-inutitive. The less you care about them, the more attracted they will get to you.
</p>

<p>
	You can treat her like your dirty, braty sister. Tell her, "If you don't behave, I'm gonna spank you like you're my dirty little sister."
</p>

<p>
	Don't let women boss you around. You have to lead them.
</p>

<p>
	The frame must be that you are more valuable than her. Then she will crave you. Women do not crave weak, low-value males.
</p>

<p>
	Basically yes. The hotter the woman, the more true it will be.
</p>

<p>
	The less hot the woman the less value you need to offer as a man to get her.
</p>

<p>
	It's an implicit value trade. A sexual auctionhouse.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect women to be able to honestly articulate what she wants in a man. It's all deeply subconscious. She will tell you all sorts of nonsense like, "I want a nice guy." This cannot be trusted. What she logically wants is irrelevant. What matters is what will make her sleep with you.

It was so vicious, we got so beat up on by pirates that we quit the game in frustration. My brother was even scammed for $100 and all his in-game money.
</p>

<p>
	Which perfectly explains why no one wants to live in libertarianland. The bullies dominate everyone else because there is no referee. EVE is a game full of scammers and trolls. In real life such people would rape your children in front of you for sport.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why EVE never went mainstream. It can only exist as a niche game for the most hardcore people.

	Because on Tinder the women are there shopping for partners/guys, and THE ONLY THING they have to judge you on is your picture. So of course, when framed like that, every woman will choose the hottest looking guy.

	Capitalism and life purpose are not in contradiction at all.
