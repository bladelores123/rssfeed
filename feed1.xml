<p>
	You are overlooking how relatove this is.
</p>

<p>
	There is far more racism and opression in less developed countries. A country doesn't need to be perfect to be developed. If you think the racism in the US is bad, you're overlooking how bad it is elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
	Democracies are not dissolving, they are getting stronger via temporary struggle. The US is more democratic now than its ever been.

<p>
	God IS Love, so it already accepts itself as that. You just require more consciousness of yourself as That.

<p>

<p>
	It can, assuming you are willing. But if you are stubborn, then that is your karma and you are stuck until such time that you surrender your stubbornness.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, karma is nothing other than your unwillingness to surrender.

<p>
	You must dive deep into whatever color stage you are still struggling with.
</p>

<p>
	You can't be solid Green until you exhaust Orange. Become so Orange that you get sick of it. Then you will be truely ready for Green.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, that's what Elliot Hulse is doing. He's playing through Blue and Orange. Burning through his karma to someday reach Green. If he ever reaches Green in this lifetime he'll see how silly and dysfunctional his rants about sluts and sexual purity were. But he needs to go through these rants to purify himself. So what you're seeing in his videos is his growing up process.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is that he is dragging his followers along with him into the dysfunction. But he can't help it. So here we are.

	You're not going to stop people from eating meat in our lifetime. It's too deeply embedded in our culture.
</p>

<p>
	It is more practical to invent lab grown meat.

	Seems like you are still resisting and have surrender and integration work to do.
</p>

<p>
	You can just lower your doses and keep integrating each trip until you stop being scared of them.
</p>

<p>
	If there is fear, there is work left to do.

<p>
	Progressive change has always required years and lots of pressure. People in power do not just give up their power willingly.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind, just because you want society to be progressive does not mean everyone else does too. In a democracy, many people are moderate or conservative. That means they vote for someone like Joe Biden. Bernie didn't have a money problem. His message was clear. It's just that he was too progressive for average folks. Bernie didn't lose because some evil elites held him back. Bernie lost because most voters are not progressive and don't want such fundamental change.
</p>

<p>
	In a democracy sometimes you have to accept defeat.
</p>

<p>
	If you are very progressive, chances are society will never be as progrssive as you want, because you are ahead of your time. This is not because of evil elites, it's because average people are not ready to make the sacrifices that progressivism requires.
</p>

<p>
	Depends on how you define "level of consciousness." Generally speaking your state will drop back to what it was before the trip. But you will remain insights, memories, and it will leave a mark on your psyche. But you will not keep the higher state as that requires neurotransmitters which you lack.

<p>
	Well, every state is God, so here it is. But this current state is nothing like the God-mode state of 5-MeO-DMT. I'm not in God-mode, I'm more in human mode.

<p>
	I can be if I train my mind on it.
</p>

<p>
	But most of the time I operate as if others are real. It's not useful to metaphysically question people all the time. It's an illusion that I play within. Sort of like when you play a video game, you're not constantly question that it's all just a game. You buy into the illusion and act as if it is real, at least for a while.

	It can in certain ways. Mostly I notice less fear about needing to please others. So I act more authentically and I feel less of a need to play social games. I think awakening makes one more direct and authentic with people.

<p>
	I've noticed that I care less and less what people think about me, which frees me up to act however I would naturally act if I was alone. Yes, less shyness, less fear, less distance with strangers. More compassion for their personal suffering.

<p>
	It does, but that doesn't mean your ego-mind will like it.
</p>

<p>
	The more Truth and Love, the more terrified you will get. Because it's not there to please or suit your personal survival needs. The deeper you go, the more of your life you'll have to surrender. How much are you willing to surrender? How selfless are you willing to be? This is very challenging for a human.
</p>

<p>
	It's much more challenging than people expect. Because you can't imagine how much illusion there is to surrender.
</p>

<p>
	I was just making a point.
</p>

<p>
	I don't recommend working 14 hrs a day. But if you aren't using your time productively, in a healthy way, you will probably start using it towards devilry of some kind.

<p>
	Productive use of time doesn't have to mean only work. It could also include family, friends, hobbies, fitness, cooking, hiking, reading, meditation, etc.

<p>
	Other people are an illusion. If you shake that illusion, life becomes very dull. Just you by yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The illusion is very hard to entirely break. For practical purposes we continue treating people as if they are real because that's what survival dictates and our minds aren't interested in truth, they are interested in illusions.

Imagination has many layers to it and your present state of consciousness does not give you access to the deepest layers. Those layers which you don't have access to you call "physical reality". As you gain more access "physical reality" will start to become more and more fluid, less solid, less "real".

<p>
	I have two basic techniques:
</p>

<p>
	1) Be so busy working on your life purpose that you don't have time to criticize others. Focus on being constructive rather than destructive. If you were working 14hrs per day on your art you wouldn't have the time or energy to criticize anyone.
</p>

<p>
	Critics are usually people who have nothing else to do. They aren't using their time productively. They aren't wise enough to channel their energy creativity.
</p>

<p>
	2) Awaken to Love. Realize that you are all people. Then it becomes impossible to criticize or judge others because you are conscious that their mistakes are your mistakes. If you were conscious that you are Hitler or Jeffery Epstein, how could you judge him?
</p>

<p>
	Judgment is only possible when there is still the illusion of "other" in your mind.

<p>
	One's political position on this graph shouldn't be a fixed thing. It should be a dynamic balancing act in response to one's current political climate.
</p>

<p>
	Today, in America, it makes sense to be in the green quadrant given the current imbalances in our society. But 50 years from now, or in a different part of the world, it might make sense to shift to another quadrant in response. Because what's most important is proper balance, not a fixed position. Which is why ideology is such a problem. Ideology acts as if one quadrant is absolutely the best, which then leads to imbalance.
</p>

<p>
	If you think right is always the best, you will fall into imbalance. If you think left is always the best, you will fall into imbalance. Life is far too complex for such simplistic attitudes. The only reason the left seems like the best today is because things has been skewed so far right in recent times. It won't always be this way. The whole key is to have such a flexible mind that you're able to move your position to what works best in the current situation.
</p>

			You visualize so intensely, that it actually becomes a reality and you literally feel the energy in your spine. At this point, we would be at Actuality, right?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes!
</p>

<p>
	You are literally imagining the new reality you want. Basic LoA.
</p>

<p>
	You are using the power of imagination to drill a portal to God. Many spiritual techniques rely on this mechanism without being explicit about it. That's how prayer works, for example. If you pray long and hard enough to Jesus, he can manifest himself to you. Because in fact Jesus is just a facet of your own mind. This is why some people worship Jesus, and it works for them. Other people worship an elephant man, and it works for them. Other people worship the devil, and it works for them. You can even worship Leo and one day I will appear to you and guide you to God. It doesn't matter what specific form your worship.
</p>

<p>
	This is why an infinite number of different religions can exist. The details of the imagery are largely irrelevant, as long as you take it seriously.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is to blur the materialist boundary between "real" vs imaginary. This boundary itself is imaginary! The more you can blur this boundary, the more powerful you can be at manifesting and manipulating reality. This how yogis develop supernatural abilities/siddhis. They train up their imagination skills.
</p>

		<p>
			”These considerations point to a telos for the topology of the membrane: if the entire membrane could fold in on itself to form one single loop encompassing all of mind – a kind of cosmic sphere of mind – there would be no trade-off. Self-reflectiveness would be all-encompassing, in the sense that all vibrations of mind – all mental contents – would fall within the field of self-reflection. There would be no ‘unconscious.’ Moreover, there would be no illusion of separation either: this one loop of mind would identify itself with all good and all evil, all bliss and all suffering, all polarities and perspectives. The full nature of mind would unavoidably penetrate the field of its own self-reflective contemplation.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, this would be a state of Total Omniscience or Infinite Consciousness. I've been in this state. This is God's purest, highest state. In this state, God is an infinite singularity which is completely self-aware and self-understanding. Nothing is hidden from its awareness. It is just pure Consciousness, pure Love.

			Why doesn’t the membrane of mind simply use its freewill to form this single global loop at once? Why hasn’t it happened yet? Why all the struggles? The answer here is rather simple: for mind at large to know that it should shape itself as a single loop it would already have to have the global self-reflectiveness that only a single loop could provide.”
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It has happened already! The mistake is assuming that Infinite Mind is limited by past or future. Past and future are things which Infinite Mind imagines, so it is not limited by them.
</p>

<p>
	God does not need to wait for some future state in order to become fully God. God is always fully God. But temporarily it can forget that it is God as it explores finite parts of itself. If God wants to know what it's like to be a kangaroo, it has to stop being omniscient for a while and pretend to be a kangaroo. During this brief period, past and future arise. Otherwise there is no past or future for God.

<p>
	Love, Will, Omniscience, Omnipotence, Intelligence, Benevolence, Creativity, etc. are all inherent to Infinity/Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The highest Will simply chooses the highest Love, which then necessitates the entire Universe exactly as it is. Because God IS Will, God IS Love. It doesn't "do" Love, it IS Love and all of its free Will goes into being Love. You can say God chooses to be Love, or you can say God has no choice but to be Love because God IS Love. Both are the same.
</p>

<p>
	There isn't a "how". God is Love. No "how" necessary. It is direct. Or, you could say it does so via Infinite Consciousness/Intelligence/Will.
</p>

<p>
	If you were infinitely conscious/intelligent, you would have no other wish but to express Love. So then your Will and your Love would be the same thing.

<p>
	God/Infinity is a tautology/necessity. God cannot be anything other than God. Reality cannot be anything but Love.

<p>
	Of course this is all relative, but I would consider these too far:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Banning eating meat
	</li>
	<li>
		Banning airline travel
	</li>
	<li>
		Public ownership of all businesses
	</li>
	<li>
		Totally open borders
	</li>
	<li>
		Abolishing the military
	</li>
	<li>
		Confiscating money from rich people
	</li>
	<li>
		Overthrowing the government
	</li>
	<li>
		Anarchism (some lefties are anarchists)
	</li>
	<li>
		Authoritarian communism like in China
	</li>
	<li>
		Antifa style violent protest
	</li>
	<li>
		Mandatory college education
	</li>
	<li>
		Forcing people to use weird gender pronouns and other silly PC labels
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	But these are such radical things no serious left-wing politician is pushing for them and they would never pass.

	Of course reality as a whole can be thought of as one system, but it's also made up of an infinite number of smaller sub-systems. You can compare different sub-systems to find commonalities which helps you understand them.

<p>
	Ego is God imagining it is not God but a human.

<p>
	God is free to imagine itself to be anything: a rock, a tree, a coffee table, a kangaroo, a man, a woman, an alien, or... it can be aware that it is God.
</p>

<p>
	It's like when you play a video game so hard you forget you are a human. Well, God is playing your life so hard right now that it forgot it is God. As soon as you remember, that will be Awakening.

You just realize that your body is already God. God is exactly what you see now, minus the ego.
</p>

<p>
	A change in your state of consciousness is required. This is accomplished with spiritual practices like self-inquiry, meditation, psychedelics, yoga, etc. The practices must be done rigorously.

	It is realizing that you are God dreaming up reality.

<p>
	Careful. Do not fall into the trap of demonizing or over-simplifying the right wing.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so simple at all. Not all right wingers are buffoons like on Fox News.

It's just a neat concept which you can appreciate if you do psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Reality isn't really a strange loop, it is Infinity. But when you try to think causually about Infinity you will run into strange loops. Strange loops are the result of a finite mind trying to grasp Infinity.

			This is perfect example of why the very idea of good, progress, evolution, betterment of society is a wrong kind of direction in your spiritual life. Desire to better society is the source of many evil, deaths and suffering. I think the authentic spiritual orientation must be fighting society, not improving it. Perhaps people who wanted to better society - have invented covid. And if not people, then let's say reality has invented covid in order to better society. Then the very desire to improve society is wrong and lead to bad outcomes. Think about it, what good society does for person, society only brainwashes person. So I guess its here not for us to improve it but for us to oppose it. If you improve it - you are helping it to increase its brainwashing power. Re-think your big picture.

<p>
	Actually, ego IS the sense of self, and it is a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Perceptions alone do not generate a sense of self. People who are conscious of no-self (no-ego) still have experiences and perceptions. Just no human self tying it all together.

<p>
	I have no interest in alcohol at all.
</p>

<p>
	If I want a drink, I'll drink some juice.
</p>

<p>
	And if I want to be intoxicated, I'll take some psychedelics.

	I went out to nightclubs and bars for about 2 years in a row.

<p>

<p>
	Right-wingers are some of biggest victims and cry-babies.
</p>

<p>
	They only take responsibility when it suits them and as much as their mind is capable of understanding, which isn't much.
</p>

<p>
	I want to see a right-winger take responsibility for terrorism, racism, slavery, wage slavery, corporatism, nationalism, environmental destruction, 3rd world exploitation, paying fair taxes, and patriarchy.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck. Lol
</p>

<p>
	They cannot take responsibility for these things because their mind does not understand them holistically enough.
</p>

<p>
	Right-wingers who take responsibility for the above are otherwise known as progressives.
</p>

<p>
	You aren't approaching enough and aren't letting go enough.
</p>

<p>
	At least one night in your life go be a party animal. Dance until you are sweaty and out of breath. Be silly and stupid. Then watch how girls get drawn to you like a magnet.
</p>

<p>
	Do it sober. But by the middle of the night will become naturally intoxicated on fun. You will become fearless. You will stop giving a fuck about what anyone thinks of you.

<p>
	To be honest, Owen can be a weird douche. But at a nightclub this is okay.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to go out, let loose, and have some fun socializing. This can be done in a way where no one gets hurt.
</p>

<p>
	I challenge you guys to go out one night and just have more fun than you've ever had in your life. And do it sober. Girls love guys who know how to have fun.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	The right has its self-improvement ways. It's usually either mainstream religion or something like Jordan Peterson.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't expect it to be anything brilliant or cutting edge. It's gonna be conformist, traditional, and materialistic.
</p>

<p>
	Everything I teach is about questioning social dogmas, so by definition this will not sit well with right-wingers. They are not interested in deconstructing culture, they are interested in defending it. That's either whole MO.

			It’s like we’re being told something else in school and the reality is completely different. I was told you have to verbally ask a woman every time you do something.
		</p>

		<p>
			But here you are saying something else. That it’s okay to touch and kiss under certain circumstances depending on her mood and setting. We, as men, are getting mixed messages from movies, songs, media, school, You, and friends. 
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>It’s like you’re saying, you can do it, probably need to do it, but it’s also kind of against the law and a taboo. As I understand this.</b>
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	As with many other domains, school left you totally unperpared to handle the realities of dating and sex.
</p>

<p>
	School does not teach those realities at all.
</p>

<p>
	Dating and sexuality is highly context sensitive and implicit. It is also so tied in with survival that it must be tightly regulated by the powerful because they want to fuck the best people themselves. So they will tell you one thing but then actually do the opposite themselves in their own private sex lives.
</p>

<p>
	Harsh truths about sex are like harsh truths about spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Flirting, playful touching, and being a good salesmen are not against the law. It's not even taboo. It happens in nightclubs and bars everywhere in the world and is generally considered acceptable. But talking openly about it is often unacceptable, especially in the MeToo era.
</p>

<p>
	Do some guys take the flirting and touching overboard into rapey territory? Sure! Some do. But you can also do it in a decent manner. Go flirt with some girls. No problem. Never force yourself on her if she isn't smiling while you do it. Her facial experssion tells you everything. If she's laughing and smiling and looking deep in your eyes, you can basically rip off her panties and do whatever you want. But as soon as her smile turns into a frown, that's when you stop. The key is to ATTRACT and CHARM her. This is very different than force.

<p>
	If it was truly unnecessary we would be able to easily eliminate it. But it's not so easy. So maybe it's more necessary than you imagine?

<p>
	I'm not saying it can't be done. Just that it's gonna be a lot harder than vegans think.

<p>
	But that's exactly what mankind has done for a million years. It's in your blood. You will do it when required or pay another to do it.
</p>

<p>
	We live in a complex economy where it's not feasible to do every detail of life yourself. A lot of ugly stuff is hidden within the vast complexity of the economy. And yet you cannot avoid the economy. Oil and gas might be killing the planet, but our economy cannot survive without it.

<p>
	I thought maybe I could try healing it and stopping it. But the more conscious I got, the more I realized it is Love and doesn't need my stopping it.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes to take away an obstacle is a disservice, weakening the student. Don't wish for life to be easier, wish for yourself to be stronger.
</p>

<p>
	This corona shit is just something mankind has to grapple with to reach the next level of evolution and love. You can't make all viruses disappear, more will come. We must rebuild society to function better for more people.

<p>
	If he thought past lives weren't imaginary, then not as woke as I have been.
</p>

<p>
	But maybe he understood they were imaginary. Hard to know.

	For example, I can talk about my childhood but I know it's imaginary.

The only reason any diet won't work is because of desire/needs not matching expectations. It's not about what we eat but how/why we eat. We can change our terrain, beliefs, and self heal at will. To preserve the body and live on higher frequencies (without force), there must be a willingness to adapt/evolve, tune into nature/our bodies and gradually consume less

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to survive an Alaskan winter on fruits and vegetables.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to survive on vegan if you have certain health conditions.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to survive on raw vegan if you don't have enough money.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	The reason people eat what they eat is because that's what allows them to survive. Of course this can be changed, but not always. And survival is a much more complex affair than merely meeting your calorie needs.

<p>
	You can make an artform out of using toilet paper. The depth of any activity is as deep as you make it. You are creating the meaning behind it. So as long as you're able to trick yourself into thinking it's meaningful, it will appear meaningful to you.
