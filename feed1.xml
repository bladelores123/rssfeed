<p>
	No, you can become conscious that you are not inside a simulation.
</p>

<p>
	Your reasoning is assuming dualities which you could transcend and be free off.

<p>
	Awakening comes with surrendering the ego-mind's insistence on control. It is the ego-mind which wants to manipulate reality. The ego-mind cannot be allowed to do whatever it wants as that would become hell.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if Bin Laden could materialize a nuclear bomb with his mind.
</p>

<p>
	Such power can only be allowed to the most selfless and loving. And infinite power can only be allowed to a completely selfless being -- the Godhead. Having form automatically limits your power. The cost of infinite power is total formlessness and total selflessness to the point where no one can even know you exist.

<p>
	It's pretty clear that they aren't speaking from some memorized script but that they are getting intuitive visions as they work with you. Stuff pops up for them in real-time. It's not like they sat down and studied a book which said: "Okay, if this guy walks in complaining about his thyroid, you tell him he was choked in a past life. And if he walks in with a back ache, you tell him he broke his back in a past life."

<p>
	You have to give these folks some credit. They are not idiots.

<p>
	See my video about Division vs Unity. That's the issue you're bringing up here.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is a constant tug of war between division and unification. Neither one is good or bad by itself. Societies unify, divide, unify, divide, unify, divide.... at higher and higher orders. There must be a delicate balance between the two or things get ugly. That's life. Embrace this oscillatory process because it is an existential feature of how reality generates itself.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, culture is important in order to create a sense of social unity. But it can also easily get out of hand and become toxic and too monocultural. Culture by itself is not inherently good or bad. There are healthy and unhealthy cultures. Distinguish between the two. Too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing.
</p>

<p>
	Also, your framing of our civilization as losing its purpose with the downfall of Christianity, that's a very limited view. Western civilization existed long before Christianity and will continue to exist long after. You are right though that we've had a flourishing of multiculturalism and a breakdown of the traditional Christian monoculture which used to unify the West. This was a necessary evolutionary step as we moved from Spiral stage Blue to Orange and beyond.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget how vicious, cruel, corrupt, and oppressive the Christian monoculture was. They burned witches at the stake. Today I can go find a witch on Yelp and hire her for her healing and psychic services. It's much better today.
</p>

<title>High Quality Resources - Question To Leo and the forum</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44480-high-quality-resources-question-to-leo-and-the-forum/?do=findComment&amp;comment=559004</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	You're right that you DO have to distinguish between good and bad resources, teachings, teachers, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This is a deep epistemic problem which ultimately roots in the problem of distinguishing truth from falsehood. How do you know what is true vs what is false? If you had an easy answer to that, you'd be awake and you wouldn't need to ask the question. The whole challenge of life is that when you enter it, you start from ground zero with no idea how to distinguish truth from falsehood. So then an epistemic journey begins. Through a combination of life experience, contemplation, research, intuition, wisdom, and trial & error you slowly learn to sort out truth from falsehood. Of course most people don't do this. They just blindly accept whatever their culture tells them. But in our work here, the whole point is to undertake a serious epistemic inquiry and derive the truth for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It's like putting together a puzzle or solving a criminal conspiracy. You have to investigate carefully and cross-reference everything.
</p>

<p>
	I addressed this process in this video:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/how-to-develop-big-picture-understanding" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/articles/how-to-develop-big-picture-understanding</a>
</p>

<p>
	Anything anyone tells you about what is true vs what is false, you cannot know if it is true or false because that would be to beg the question. Which is why a direct personal inquiry is required. The only way you can know if what I'm telling you is true and a good teaching is by investigating and validating it for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to jump straight to the answer, the highest teachings in the universe will emphasize a few key things:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Direct experience is king
	</li>
	<li>
		Consciousness is the key to everything
	</li>
	<li>
		Love is the highest truth
	</li>
	<li>
		Selflessness is the greatest power
	</li>
	<li>
		You are God, You are All
	</li>
	<li>
		Reality is ONE & infinite
	</li>
	<li>
		Death is an illusion
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't get stuck in any one belief system. All belief systems are relative and incomplete.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Of course, you don't know if the above is true or false unless you personally validate it. But I promise you that if you work at it, in 10 to 20 years from now, you can validate all the above beyond any doubt. But again, you don't know if that's true unless you actually do it.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of your life is to go on this grand epistemic journey, the end result of which -- if you do it very carefully -- is Truth with a capital T. And by that point you become the guru and people come to you for advice. But you also cannot really help them because you know the only way for them to know what you know is to go through the long and personal process you went through. Truth is simply too big to be told.
</p>

<p>
	I recently went to two different psychics/healers. Each one told me that they got a vision that I was strangled by the neck in a past life, which created a blockage of the throat chakra.
</p>

<p>
	Can't say if it's true or not, but it was quite amazing that two different people said something so specific. What are the odds of that?

	Even if you get pure synthetic mescaline it will still cause nausea, even if plugged. Mescaline's just not tolerated well by the body.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, it should be a lot more pleasant than drinking a gallon of cactus juice.
</p>

<p>
	Methallylescaline (MAL) is the closest synthetic mescaline analogue.
</p>

<p>
	It will be much easier to dose than mescaline, and much cheaper.

</p>

<p>
	If you were going there to apprentice under a serious guru, that might be worth it. Probably not so good for starting a biz, although low cost of living and cheap labor can be very important when starting a biz. But there are other places you could do that from that might be better, like the Philippines.
</p>

<p>
	Online biz you can run from many places.

<p>
	Well.... it depends how you read. Of course reading can be a great adjunct to contemplation -- grist for the mill so to speak. But even so, reading tends to fill the mind with preconceived ideas and beliefs which limit serious contemplation. The best contemplation is done from scratch, without reliance on other people's ideas. Like deriving mathematical proofs for oneself without reading the textbook.
</p>

<p>
	Reading is useful, it just isn't deep contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	You need to learn to develop stuff on your own, without building on top of a mountain of others' ideas. This then allows you to think outside the box. If you build on a mountain of others' ideas, you will not think far enough outside the box because you're going to internalize all of their core assumptions and get stuck in paradigm lock. This is one of the biggest problems for academics and scientists. They rely too heavily on that mountain of ideas without thinking independently enough. And how do they get that mountain of ideas in their head? By reading a lot without deeply questioning what they read.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation is not taught in school or university. Because that would be too dangerous. Students are taught to be parrots, not true philosophers.

	Micro-dosing a psychedelic would be far preferable to drinking. Cheaper, healthier, and more fun.
</p>

<p>
	Modafinil is also a nice supplement for PU. Increases verbal skills and creativity.

<p>
	Philosophy is love of wisdom. A philosopher is one who sits around contemplating reality. You can contemplate reality without reading a single book. Reading is not contemplating. You can go live in a cabin in the woods and be a philosopher.
</p>

<p>
	Philosophers in universities don't do much contemplating. They are like caged birds. Don't expect them to fly very far.

<p>
	Firstly, I don't know why you're so low. Orange/Green should be fairly attainable for you with a bit of personal dev work, which you'd be doing anyway as part of your coach training. Dare to aim high!
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, there still exists a lot of stage Blue people even in Canada who you could specialize in working with if you wanted to.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically, to be a good coach, you should be fairly decently developed and mature. That's sort of the point of going to a coach. If you're not mature enough yet, that's okay, just plan to be a coach later in your life and in the meantime train and work in some related fields. I wouldn't recommend becoming a coach if you are younger than 25 or even 30. You need some life experience first.

<p>
	You know why they called him John the Baptist? Because you came to him to find God, he would hold your head under water until you were near-drowned and dead, then he would pull you back up at the last second.
</p>

<p>
	If you were lucky you got a Near Death Experience.
</p>

<p>
	And so we got Baptism.
</p>

<p>
	Try doing that today and see how fast you get sued.
</p>

<p>
	And people complain Actualized.org is dangerous. Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	In India some yogis would do the ring of fire: where they sit you down naked in the middle of the hottest noon sun, then they light 4 fires around you, to the North, South, East, West, and have you sit through that for hours.

<p>
	That's just not true.
</p>

<p>
	Go apprentice under a serious Zen master or yogi. He will push your ass to enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse mainstream spiritual celebrities like Eckhart Tolle with some of the hardcore masters.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can take soft and hard approaches. The hard approach is not always best. It depends on the student. Most Western students simply can't handle the hard approach. Westerners tend to be soft and lazy these days.
</p>

<p>
	I've heard of a Japanese Zen master who would force his students to sit extra long without pee breaks so they could suffer a little bit more and wake up faster.

<p>
	When death comes for you, your only option will be surrender. Then you'll understand the wisdom in it.
</p>

<p>
	Manipulation and survival (what you're describing with your examples above) are always limited and will at some point hit a dead end. At that point the only thing left is surrender.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, go ahead and run from the lion if you can. But once the lion has you by the throat, you should surrender.
</p>

<p>
	The whole spiritual path is about learning the wisdom of surrender. Which is why most ego don't like to do it. They are too busy surviving and manipulating the world, hoping they can keep it up forever. But it never lasts. You cannot manipulate forever. That is devilry.

<p>
	I'm into personal development. I don't want some monkey on my back. You don't learn PU well when drunk. I have never had an interest in alcohol. It's like the opposite of a psychedelic: a stupid man's drug. It's also terrible for you. And here in Vegas drinks cost $10-$20 each! For $20 I can get a lap dance from a hot ass stripper who will rub her tits in my face.

<p>
	Well, not much you can do about that. Just do your best.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you quit early you can always push harder at the next retreat. It will be a lesson learned.

<p>
	Just be curious about stuff. Stop taking things for granted. Go outside and wonder at the ants crawling around on the sidewalk. Buy a magnifying glass to look at them closer. Study them. Appreciate how amazing they are.

	And so forth.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	All spiritual practices are ultimately about this. But even before you do heavy spiritual practice you can just start by being much more curious about small mundane things like ants, birds, trees, people, clouds, language, politics, religion, science, space, the moon, etc. There is no end to curiosity. Buy a telescope and look at the stars. Buy a microscope and look at the microscopic life in a puddle of water from the sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
	Leonardo Da Vinci is a great role-model for curiosity. Maybe study him and his work a bit.
</p>

<p>
	Or if you're really lazy, just search for cool stuff like this on Youtube:

If you want to believe in that sort of thing. In fact, you could go to multiple different ones and cross-reference their results.
</p>

<p>
	I've had some psychics read my past lives. It's interesting. Hard to say what it really means though because I don't have a direct experience of them so it ultimately boils down to a story from my POV. But if you could corroborate it with your own direct experience, that would be something even more interesting.

<p>
	Planning out the logistics is key, so you have everything you need once you start and your mind can be fully absorbed in the present.

	Buddhist monks talk of the "dancing Buddha." That's when you stare at a Buddha statue for so long and with so much focus that it starts to wave around and "dance" -- just like it would if you took some LSD.

<p>
	That's right, the stronger your focus the more psychedelic your visual field will become.
</p>

<p>
	That's a tiny taste of how psychedelics work.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that multipled by 100.

	There cannot be liberation without surrender.

<p>
	The ego-mind wants control, so it views surrender as "bad", which is precisely backwards.

Actually, I will watch your video on this, but... one thing I love about the David R Hawkins approach to Letting Go is identifying the pay-offs for the thoughts, attitudes, stances, emotions, behaviours, and letting the pay off's go first, and surrendering these. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Do you recall if the Sedona method or even your video on letting go, has such emphasis on identifying the "hidden" or not so hidden pay-off's, as I think this is a crucial element of it all. 
		</p>

<p>
	Sure, that can be useful to identify.

But you have no idea what you're missing.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not something that you can be forced to do. You do it willfully out of mature consciousness and wisdom that love is the best in ever case.

You are taking life soooo for granted.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that those things won't make you happy, rather all things should make you happy.
</p>

<p>
	Right now you are looking for some escape hatch from life via awakening, but the thing that awakening will reveal is that the escape hatch leads right back here! There is nowhere to go since here is already nowhere and nothing. The secret to happiness is simply taking great interest and joy in the tiniest things, like holding a glass of water in your hand or feeling the texture of your shirt as you put it on in the morning. 
</p>

<p>
	The magic and joy is found in Being itself, not in any destination.
</p>

<p>
	Life requires passion. Awakening requires passion. Stop waiting around for passion to come from outside. Generate it from within by starting to notice how amazing reality is at every corner. Don't take anything for granted.
</p>

<p>
	Cultivate a curiosity and passion about reality. Then awakening will be possible.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic to remind yourself how magical being is. You have lost touch with being. And being and awakening are one and the same.
</p>

<p>
	Because you are all facets of life.
</p>

<p>
	You got the question backwards. The real question is, why hate or reject any facet of your Self?
</p>

<p>
	Rejection of Self is what creates all suffering. So from a purely practical perpective anything less than love is foolishness as you are the one who suffers for it.

<p>
	By this I mean, just sit there and mindfully suffer the sound until you surrender.

<p>
	Sedona Method should also work well. See my Letting Go video. In the end you're gonna have to let it go one way or another.

<p>
	These kind of questions will not help you understand Love.
</p>

<p>
	You need a direct mystical experience of it. Nothing can substitute for that. Until such time Love is just a myth from your POV.

<p>
	4 grams, but you have to keep in mind that I am much more sensitive to all psychedelics than average people. About twice as sensitive. So 4g is probably closer to 6-8 grams.

<p>
	5-MeO certainly helps. But it's not the only factor. Perhaps even more important it the contemplation work. I find making sense of the trip very important. That clears things up in the mind, allowing for deeper trips every time as puzzles get resolved and settled.

<p>
	They definitely get existential insights but most people have such a poor theoretical foundation that they don't understand the significance of what the trips show them. They play around in it for a while but then they drop back down and the whole thing is treated as some wacky alien experience at a party. It's not taken seriously enough or deeply contemplated.
</p>

<p>
	And of course some people DO contemplate deeply even at raves and grow themselves spiritually. Just because it's a rave doesn't mean it can't transform you.

<p>
	Sounds like the trip took you exactly where you needed to go.
</p>

<p>
	If you are afraid of dogs, how are you gonna face death & God? You must slay that demon before going deeper.

You can redose it any time from what I understand, although I am never in the mood to redose it the same day. One deep trip is usually good enough for me for at least a day.

<p>
	LSD affects the body's thermo-regulation and commonly causes a feeling of being colder than usual. Just wear warmer clothes and have blankets around before you trip.

<p>
	The mind is desperately looking for certainty and grounding a groundless universe. To it tells itself stories to create an illusion of grounding. Then the mind can feel secure and safe.
</p>

<p>
	The mind doesn't want to admit that reality is fundamentally Unknowable. That is not useful for survival.

<p>
	Both should work.
</p>

<p>
	Just be conscious of the hand's existence. Try to "feel" or register the mystery of it existing there.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that's your goal! The more you become conscious of it, the more mysterious and unknown it will become. Don't try to demystify it. Rather you are becoming more and more conscious of the mystery of Being/Existence/God.
</p>

<p>
	That hand is God! Try to notice that. What does it mean to say that the hand is God? Wonder about that as you stare at it.
</p>

<p>
	WONDERING is a crucial aspect of this work. You need to genuinely and deeply wonder about existence itself and every object in it. Don't take anything for granted, not even your hand. How do you even know it is "your" hand? Who told you? What is a "hand" anyway? What remains after you remove all ideas, beliefs, stories, memories, labels, categories, and other projections from the "hand"? What is the hand made out of? What is its substance? (Hint: not cells or atoms.)
</p>

<p>
	Be very patient and persistent with this process. Also, be gentle about it. Do it in a calm and relaxed state of mind without demanding some immediate answer. Look at your hand as though you're seeing it for the first time in your life. Don't take it for granted as a given.
</p>

Despite the doubt, I know it was my best alone experience of my life for sure. How do I tell the difference if it’s a real non dual experience?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Sounds like it was a genuine experience in the moment, but as soon as you came down you lost track of it almost completely because you haven't gone deeply enough into the contemplation work.
</p>

<p>
	The point is not just to trip. The point of a trip is use that window of expanded consciousness to contemplate and gain understanding about how consciousness/reality works. If you do that, after many trips you will develop a deep understanding which can be retained even when you're not in the trip. The understanding extends into sober material reality. But this takes serious contemplation work. You have to be interested in understanding the ins and outs of consciousness. Psychedelics are just vehicles for the exploration and understanding of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It is like traveling to America by sail ship in the 15th century from Europe. How much of America can you understand after one voyage? Not even 1%. Which is why explorers took many voyages and kept careful notes and deeply studied and contemplated what they saw there. All exploration works this way. We are doing this with Mars right now -- sending new voyagers there every few years, and we hardly know anything about Mars even after 20+ trips. Scientists are hard at work back on Earth digesting and contemplating the results of every voyage every year. They spend more time contemplating the results of the voyage than they do on the voyage itself.
</p>

<p>
	Take clues from this exploration process as to how to go about exploring consciousness.
</p>

			What were the challenges of the bad trips you've described you had?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Mostly existential issues such as the sense of going insane or losing one's mind.
</p>

<p>
	That is especially problematic until you realize that there is no material reality and that everything is Infinite Imagination.
</p>

<p>
	And a few times the trips just felt "off" for some unknown reason. Like they had a bad, negative body vibe to them. I'm not sure why. Maybe it was interference from certain medication I was taking or just something in my mind going sideways.
</p>

<p>
	And sometimes if the dose is too strong, material reality melts so much that it can become scary in itself.
</p>

<p>
	In total I've had maybe 6 "bad trips" out of 80+
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		One I attribute to early arrogance and too high a dose (with mushrooms), which led to sense of going insane
	</li>
	<li>
		One I attribute to interaction with a medication I was taking (with LSD)
	</li>
	<li>
		One I attribute to eating some food right before the trip (with 5-MeO-DMT)
	</li>
	<li>
		One I attribute to simply very deep existential insight which creates such deep mindfuckery it becomes uncomfortable (with 4-AcO-DMT, although I don't really consider this a bad trip)
	</li>
	<li>
		One I attribute to a panic attack reaction upon first time taking 5-MeO-DMT, fearing it might be terrible
	</li>
	<li>
		One I attribute to taking a new research chemical which had an awful body load
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Some other trips were uncomfortable or shocking, but I wouldn't call them bad.
</p>

<p>
	And in the big picture, all of them were necessary and perfect for my growth. Especially my worst trips.
</p>

<p>
	If you get a bad trip, that's God trying to teach you a lesson. You only have to figure out what the lesson is and obey it next time. Then the punishment stops. For example, you dose too high because you are cocky and aren't patient enough to ramp up doses, God punishes you. You learn your lesson and never do that again. Everything goes smoothly.
</p>

<p>
	If I dosed less carefully I would have a lot more bad trips. Moderate dosing is crucial.
</p>

<p>
	It was that way basically from my first trip. But the clarity has now skyrocketed to the point where every trip is insane levels of omniscience and universal insight.
</p>

<p>
	It took maybe 50 trips to start to get comfortable in the psychedelic space. The mindfuckry of those initial 50 breakthroughs is so strong it obscures the clarity -- as the mind struggles to understand what is happening to it.

<p>
	Your craving for sex isn't transcended simply by withholding from sex.
</p>

<p>
	Denial of your sex drive only doubles your problem by adding on an additional layer of guilt and self-hatred.
</p>

<p>
	The sex drive is not an addiction in the same way smoking is. The sex drive is still there even if you stop. It's more similar to hunger. It's also not unhealthy, like hunger, unless you take it overboard. The sperm your body generates is going to leave your body regardless, so you certainly aren't "saving it".
</p>

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	But be aware that the ego-mind easily gets too attached to things it likes.
</p>

<p>
	For example, are you detached enough to admit flaws and problems in Japanese culture which require reform? If not, then that becomes the problem of nationalism.
</p>

<p>
	Japan is actually a good example of a culture blinded by its own nationalism.

			the ‘transition’ from ego awareness into pure consciousness was really smooth and enjoyable – I felt no fear at all, but appreciated the dissolution. Furthermore the experience was very clear and straight. Until now I had a few trips using mushrooms, 1P LSD, 2C-B and changa, however this was the first time, that there was absolutely no resistance caused by a struggling ego nor any twisted imagery.

<p>
	Of course I was generalizing about the hardcore conservatives. Moderate conservatives are more open to a compromise like I prosed.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, we have reached a reasonable compromise decades ago with Roe v Wade. A majority of Americans are happy with it.
</p>

<p>
	Outlawing abortion would be anti-democratic as only a small vocal minority want that.

I could be wrong. Just my guess.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that awakening does not automatically preclude nationalism. Zen monks have historically been very nationalistic, even supporting Imperial Japan's aggressive actions in WWII.

	Dude, those are your relative standards. Ain't not mystic or guru gotta follow that.
</p>

<p>
	The basic spiritual principle you're failing to follow here is: non-judgment.
</p>

<p>
	By judging Mooji you actually reveal yourself to be less conscious than him. He probably wouldn't judge you.
</p>

<p>
	Of all the people in the world you could be harping on, you choose Mooji?? He has helped awaken more people than you can count. How many people have you helped to awaken?

<p>
	Hehehe....
</p>

<p>
	That's the whole trick. Money is survival. Business is survival. If it wasn't for that, LP would be easy and everyone would be doing it.
</p>

<p>
	The whole trick to following your dreams is that you also have to be extremely pragmatic about it. You can't just dream shit up, you have to make it fly in the real world given all the limitations and restrictions of the real world. In other words, if you want you dreams to be actualized, you need to find a path for their survival on the material plane, otherwise they will remain merely ideas floating around in your mind. The hard part of life is creating a material thing which can sustain itself and yet still not be so evil as the destroy everything in its path.
</p>

<p>
	To actualized your dreams is not much different than creating a baby, expect it's harder because now God doesn't do it automatically for you. Now you have to engineer it yourself and you must make sure it can survive. Now you are consciously playing God. What kind of God will you be? What kind of monstrosity will you create?

	Serious coaching programs usually cost $5,000-$10,000. Such a program will teach you most of the basics. But even then, your ability to earn money is not guaranteed. Being a successful coach requires knowing how to run a small business -- because that's what coaching for pay is. So you will also needs to develop business and marketing skills. Then you'll have a chance at success.
</p>

<p>
	Being in India makes things a lot more complicated because the level of development of that country will probably look down upon life coaching. You could find ways to make it work but you'll have to get creative and innovate to find what solutions are needed by the people in your country.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically I'd say your first step should be to find a way to study aboard. Then maybe you can return back and build a business there.
</p>

<p>
	Research online for various coaching programs. I did this one and recommend it:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.ipeccoaching.com/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.ipeccoaching.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	They offer a training in Singapore. But it costs about $10,000. But if you think about it, $10k for a career training is actually very cheap. A university degree would cost you a lot more. At least in the US. Not sure about how it works in India.

</p>

<p>
	This advice is specifically for you (Arzola) not others.
</p>

<p>
	Double down on the work you are already doing rather than distracting yourself with university coursework. You will not find Truth or Love in a university unless you bring it there from the outside.
</p>

<p>
	Self-taught philosophy is the only true kind. The rest is parroting the words of dead men.

<p>
	How about going to a Zen monastery or Indian ashram instead? Those will toughen you up without contributing to the needless death of others.
</p>

<p>
	There are many ways to toughen yourself up. For example, you can go camping in the wilderness for a month.

<p>
	There are ways to work behind the scenes, but if you're going to contribute to the world in a meaningful way then naturally people will come to hear of you and your work.
</p>

<p>
	Don't think of it as pursuing fame. That's silliness. Rather, you're just executing your vision for the world and whoever hears about it will hear it about, it shouldn't bother you. And probably you want your work to touch many people, otherwise what's the point?

<p>
	I advise you guys stay out of occult practices and rather focus on core consciousness work. Awakening and self-mastery is what you really want.
</p>

<p>
	Pursuing the occult with an unmastered ego-mind is a recipe for problems.

	Online dating is a very specific thing. Everyone is there with the goal of hooking up. It's the online equivalent of a nightclub. That's not the case with Facebook, Instagram, YT, forums, etc.

<p>
	The conservative girl is unable to wrap her mind around the idea that gender is a relative mental construct. So to her the idea of something other than the traditional, black & white man/woman roles does not compute and seems absurd.
</p>

<p>
	Blue REALLY struggles with issues of relativity. They just don't stomach relativity because to them the world is absolutely as their beliefs say.
</p>

<p>
	This is also a good example of how the mind projects. The conservative girl's mind thinks that it can make others look foolish when really it is projecting its own foolishness as a denial mechanism so that she doesn't have to deeply question the groundless distinctions that make up her worldview.
</p>

<p>
	But also notice how stage Green (the TYT hosts) are also unable to understand where this conservative girl is coming from. They just think she's a fool, when really, her mind is simply not yet fathoming the relative nature of reality.
</p>

	The distinctions you create are what enslave you.
</p>

<p>
	To become free you must surrender them.
</p>

<p>
	You do not need to create a story around porn in order to decide not to watch it. You can simply decide that your vision for your life excludes porn. If porn makes you feel bad, then let THAT be your reason, not its lack of reality.

<title>Delusional? Becoming God - Jim Carey +THC</title>

</p>

<p>
	Were you directly conscious of it or not? Forget what Jim Carry or Leo say.
</p>

<p>
	I cannot speak to your medication issues, I'm not a psychiatrist and I have no idea what you're taking or why.
</p>

<p>
	I suspect you may be on these medications but really you are spiritually gifted and the medication is suppressing that in you. If you have a spiritually gifted mind don't expect others to understand what you're dealing with because they are in a different reality relative to you. Your job is to figure out how to harness your paranormal abilities. Regular doctors and psychiatrists will not understand and they will give you improper and even harmful advice simply because they are spiritually clueless and they only see your case from the materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds to me like you are a shaman in the making, but society and your parents have been leading you astray from your destiny. It takes a lot of soul-searching and inner work to harness your unique paranormal abilities. This usually involves a great inner struggle.
</p>

<p>
	Dalai Lama spent his whole life fighting for Tebatan nationalism.
</p>

<p>
	Given the era he was born in, you'd expect him to have nationalistic tendencies. And of course he is a cultural icon of Tibet. He embraces his culture.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment does not free the mind of its cultural programming and biases.
</p>

<p>
	More broadly speaking, transcending culture does not mean all cultures disappear and you cannot tell the difference between Japan and Mexico or Brazil and Italy. You just stop creating an identity out of any one particular culture.
</p>

<p>
	I can acknowledge American culture, for example, without attaching myself to "being an American". I am not an American because I am the whole Universe. So are you.

<p>
	Still not pure enough. Your home filteration system will not be as good as industrial grade filtration.
</p>

<p>
	Pure spring water costs $30/mo per person in America. Don't be cheap. Your health costs way more. You pay more for your phone bill.

<title>Radical Opinion on Abortion?</title>

</p>

<p>
	In practice, though I agree that we can set some reasonable cut-off point for normal healthy pregnancies. Perhaps at 4 months. And longer if doc sees there are complications.
</p>

<p>
	I think this would be a good political compromise. But the hardcore right-wing will not accept such a compromise because they got it in their mind that all abortion is murder and they use compromise to keep pushing that timeline lower and lower and lower because they want it at zero and with no exceptions for rape, incest, or complications.
</p>

<p>
	But about 75% of the US would agree to such a compromise. The ban abortion crowd is a small but vocal minority.

</p>

<p>
	If you do not use your mind properly, you will get nightmares come to life. If you don't want nightmares, think pure thoughts. If you cannot help but think impure thoughts that is because you have not done sufficient growth, development, and spiritual purification work.
</p>

<p>
	Impure mind comes from bad karma.

There is no solution to this issue other than to just approach anyway, despite the fear and excuses.
</p>

<p>
	The anxiety goes away AFTER you make a few approaches. Not before.
</p>

<p>
	Push yourself to approach even if you have 10 good excuses for why you shouldn't. That is the key. Just don't listen to your mind at this moment. If you start arguing with yourself about whether you should approach, you've already failed. You need to literally just start moving your legs towards the girl. The mind may protest but the legs can walk.
</p>

<p>
	The crucial mistake is thinking you should have something good to say upon approach. Don't prepare anything to say. Just approach and be as genuine about it as possible. Do not try to prepare a good line or opener. Just approach with a smile and good eye contact. The words need to come to you authentically after the open. Trying to pre-script it is a big mistake.

Friends are not made that way. Go out into the real world and put your balls on the line.
</p>

<p>
	You are basically spamming people to be your friend, which looks really weak, so of course they don't respond back.
</p>

<p>
	You should not be using online for building connection/attraction. The proper use of text messages and the like is to facilitate real-life meetings which you've already had in the past and want more of in the future. They are not to be used as a substitute for face-to-face.

<p>
	1) How many ug's was each of your tabs? They can vary a lot. Purity can also vary. Some tabs can be weak. You should aim for about 125ug tabs.
</p>

<p>
	2) LSD has at least 1 week of tolerance build-up, so tripping twice in one week will make your second trip much less. So doubling those tabs probably had the same effect of 1 tab.
</p>

<p>
	3) You may have natural tolerance to it, requiring higher doses.
</p>

<p>
	4) Clearly your mind is full of impurities, which is why you get into this bad trip territory. All of that psychological baggage needs to be worked through so you are free to tackle the serious existential questions like God, Truth, and Love.
</p>

<p>
	"Within me", "out there", and "another person" are thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot use thought to grasp thought any more than you can use a knife to cut itself.
</p>

<p>
	Sit in silence and observe thoughts arising.

	Not at all. Heavy metals are present all over the place: food, water, drinks, cosmetics, shampoo, toothpaste, spices, etc.
