<p>
	Because when I explicitly asked him about love, he brushed it off as merely an emotion. This clearly shows that something is missing. It's not merely a matter of defintions and words. He is missing that facet of awakening, which is why he doesn't teach it.
</p>

<p>
	Worry about your own bias.

	Because you ARE Infinite Love. The soul will settle for nothing less.

<p>
	What you seek is simply consciousness of your true nature.

<p>
	Lust for other women is common for men. It's just how we tend to be wired. But this idea that you should deliberately sleep around is stupid if you are already in a happy relationship.
</p>

<p>
	I would say, if you like this girl, commit to being with her. And if it doesn't work out and you become single, then you can sleep around at that time.
</p>

<p>
	There are times to sleep around, but when you're in a loving relationship already isn't one of those times.
</p>

<p>
	Be mindful that you sleeping around would cause her lots of suffering and it would certianly destroy your relationship. She will never forgive you for sleeping around. Nor should she, because you're acting like an ass, throwing away a good thing by thinking with your dick.

	It's pretty absurd to ask for someone else to tell you how to think for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But if you must act so absurdly, I have videos on Contemplation, How To Contemplate Using A Journal, and The Power Of Asking Questions.
</p>

You're not conscious that love is an Absolute. No amount of talk or excuses is going to overcome this basic omission.
</p>

<p>
	I am communicating a thing which you are refusing to understand because you assume it cannot be true. But you are simply wrong. Nothing personal. The mind is just a tricky beast. I am here to guide you towards realizing Love, no matter how much you deny it.

<p>
	Of course I can't crawl inside his head and know with 100% accuracy how he uses the word love.
</p>

<p>
	But Love is not a trap. To reduce it to that is a grave error.
</p>

<p>
	People can fall victim to all sorts of traps in this work. There are many "truth traps", but that doesn't keep him from using the word Truth in reference to the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone doing this work starts with their own flawed ideas about what Truth, Love, God, Self, and Consciousness are. That's all par for the course. That doesn't mean we stop using those words. We need some words to speak of such facets. Those words are as good as we'll get. The error is not in the words but in the ego-minds who can't help but misunderstand them.

<p>
	Love = Truth = Being = Consciousness
</p>

<p>
	There is only one substance of which the entire universe is made. That stuff is Love.
</p>

<p>
	It is problematic that Ralston's work (his books) do not use the word "Love" basically at all. From my POV, that's a very serious omission. That would be like writing a cookbook that never mentions the word "salt".

They just aren't recognized as such because their behavior is normalized by various social norms.
</p>

<p>
	If there wasn't a strong government (as the Libertarians want), rape and enslavement would be very real possibilities in your life. This is the key insight that Libertarians are missing.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarians basically want a boxing match without a referee on the grounds that a referee unfairly restricts their freedom. Well, that boxing match will very quickly devolve into an execution. Freedom means that your opponent can rape your corpse after he's done killing you.

	My political predictions are not infallible and they do not hinge on the Absolute. They are relativistic predictions.
</p>

<p>
	It would be idiotic to claim that I know with 100% certainty what will happen in 2020 because I had some awakenings. And of course I never made such claims.

Ego wants positivity and pleasure and good mood. All of that is conditional and fleeting and leads to suffering and self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot become happy by chasing positive mood. Chasing positive mood leads to suffering.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is this: if you want to be happy, you have to stop caring whether you are happy or not.

<p>
	There's no mystery here.
</p>

<p>
	You can have total understanding of life's greatest metaphysical questions but not necessarily have it reflected in your outward behavior. What he means when he says, "I have all the answers" is existential answers, not survival answers. Existential answers do not requires any outward behaviors. You can have many existential answers but still be an asshole.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is conflating awakening itself with transformation of the mind, body, and human self. Having awakenings is relatively easy while changing the structures and habits of the mind is much harder and takes a long time of sustained practice.
</p>

<p>
	Also, nothing about awakening requires the guy to stay with his wife and family, or conform to any other kind of social expectations. They are projecting those expectations onto him. The expectations of how an enlightened person ought to behave. Nothing says that an enlightened person ought to act nice towards you.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is conflating issues of Absolute Truth with survival. Just because you are conscious of Absolute Truth does not mean you'll be good at managing money or family. Nor does it even mean you will feel positive. These are all separate issues.
</p>

<p>
	One of things awakening tends to do is make one uninterested in mundane survival issues. As they are seen to be trivial.
</p>

<p>
	Nope

<p>
	Like I said. That's not necessary for solitude. Living in a cabin in the woods is impractical when I run an online business. And actually, it's impractical period. Hard to get food there.

	Just to clarify, this also might change. There are phases in life when I am more isolated, and other phases when I am more social.
</p>

<p>
	And solitude does not literally require a cabin in the woods. Solitude can be had in the middle of a busy city.

This is bullying 101. The bully has no sense of what it's like to be on the receiving end of the bullying.

<p>
	It helps to be bullied so you understand what it feels like.

<p>
	Don't be so defeatist. Dems have a decent chance of winning back the Senate in 2020. Most voters are not blind Trumpists. Many voters will be upset at Republican Senators in swing states next year. Could be enough to flip the Senate. Another blue wave is likely. Impeachment rallies the progressive base.

<p>
	Your analysis lacks nuance. Both parties are not at all the same and are not equally corrupt.
</p>

<p>
	Also, most politicians care about a lot more than getting reelected. They work hard to create the best government they know how to create.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to make simplistic and naive critiques without having lifted a finger to actually create a good government.
</p>

<p>
	You may have escaped the trap of being a Republican, but you've now fallen into another. It takes a lot of careful study and contemplation to start to understand how government and politics work. Careful acting like a know-it-all in this domain. You have years of learning ahead of you.
</p>

<p>
	There is a lot more to creating good government than picking one of two sides, or picking no side.
</p>

<p>
	Subject/object is a duality. The ultimate nature of reality cannot be understood via that distinction, or any other distinction.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: What Is Perception?
</p>

<p>
	"Experience" is already a dualistic, biased notion. Strictly speaking experience does not occur because there is no experiencer.
</p>

<p>
	There is no reality or world outside of one's imagination. You imagined your birth and you imagine your death.

<p>
	Causing people suffering is not sufficent grounds for impeachment.
</p>

<p>
	It does not matter that the Senate will not remove him. Their votes are good enough to publically shame them.
</p>

<p>
	Successful impeachment does not require removal. Tarnishing the entire right-wing brand is good enough. Senators may lose their seats by voting in Trump's favor. The more Republicans debase themselves to defend Trump the better for future progress. They are making fools of themselves.

</p>

<p>
	The Ukraine scandal is clear cut, unlike those other cases. When you try a criminal you need an airtight case.
</p>

<p>
	It is okay to get Al Capone on tax evasion when you don't have a smoking gun for murder.
</p>

<p>
	Law enforcement is a pragmatic thing. Dems have to be careful not to overreach. Ukriane is crystal clear to anyone with a bit of intellectual integrity. So it's a great thing to impeach him on.

<p>
	It doesn't matter what the polls say, impeachment is about enforcement of law. If Trump was not impeached he would have total immunity, which is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	All anti-impeachment arguments on political grounds are non-sense. The politics are irrelevant. Clear criminal behavior must be enforced, not when politically convenient or if it moves polls, but always.
</p>

<p>
	Law and order.
</p>

<p>
	Moving polls is not what impeachment is about.

<p>
	A wave function is itself a thought. Thought cannot describe thought.
</p>

<p>
	Symbolic understanding can only go so far because it is always 2nd order phenomenon. All language and explanation is dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	Symbolic understanding can never explain itself and it is always incomplete, a la Godel's Incompleteness Theorem.
</p>

<p>
	The only complete thing is Absolute Infinity, which is reality itself, not a map of it.

</p>

<p>
	The key mistake you're making is assuming that by cranking up suffering you can make a thing more real or true. But all this does is make the illusion stronger. No matter how much pain or suffering you are stir up, it does not make it real.
</p>

<p>
	By your silly logic, you could show clips of the bloodiest horror movies to argue that movies are real. But just because a movie shows horror doesn't make it any more real.
</p>

<p>
	Your selfishness is getting in the way of seeing Infinite Love. Yes, those clips you linked are absolutely Infinite Love. Your ego is just making you judge them because you lack consciousness, because you have not done any serious spiritual work.

<p>
	Tease her and flirt with her. Be playful in your conversations. Share some stories about yourself with her so she gets a feel for who you are.
</p>

<p>
	THEN you can ask for her number. Don't mention the word "date". You can tell her, "Let's grab a coffee sometime" as you get her number.
</p>

<p>
	Learning that delicate balance requires lots and lots of failure. So just go find more girls to flirt with.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	#1 rule with girls: never explicitly tell them about sex. If she's gonna fuck you, she needs to be able to maintain the appearance of being a lady. When you tell her explicitly about sex, you make her feel like a cheap whore, and she will never sleep with you after that.
</p>

<p>
	You must play subtle and coy.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of "You down to fuck?" make it, "Let's get a coffee." Make things sound as innocent as possible. Rather than telling her, "Let's go have sex" tell her, "Let's go watch cartoons".
</p>

<p>
	There is no problem if you wanna fuck. Just don't go telling girls about it. Dating is a game. You gotta flirt and tease your way into her pants.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive. One of the best things you can do is act like you are totally disinterested in sex. You can even tell her, "We are definitely not having sex tonight." Then have sex with her 10 minutes later.
</p>

<p>
	Get good at playing these mind games.
</p>

She doesn't even know you exist. Move on.
</p>

<p>
	A girl who is attracted to you will respond to texts within minutes or hours at most.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot attract girls via text. If she's not responsive it's because you failed to build attraction in person and nothing can be done to overcome that.
</p>

<p>
	You must reach hook-point in person in order to get responsive texts. Try harder to reach hook-point. It's very noticable when you do. Usually happens within 5-10 mins. You will feel her get enthusiastic about you. She will look in your eyes and be very interested in what you have to say. She will be eager to follow your lead.
</p>

<p>
	Do not spend any time thinking about girls who haven't hooked. It will only bring you misery.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I have worldly obligations. Mostly with my biz (Actualized.org) and you guys. Also a bit of family obligations, but not much.
</p>

<p>
	I am not a social person because I find it too shallow and I like my freedom.
</p>

<p>
	I don't need to talk much about these topics with people/family because I get it out via my videos. The videos are my outlet.
</p>

<p>
	To me social balance looks like living in a cabin in the woods with maybe a girlfriend. And interacting with students via teachings or writing. I don't care for having a social life in the conventional sense.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to emulate this unless it feels natural to you. People have different social preferences. Mystics tend to have an abnormally high tolerance for solitude.
</p>

<p>
	Figure out what you want. What I want is irrelevant to you.
</p>

<p>
	Of course selfish vs selfless is a duality. Ying and yang feeding each other.
</p>

<p>
	Good with a captial G is absolutely everything. If you have to self-actualize to be Good, your notion of Good is far too weak and conditional.
</p>

<p>
	You are Good even if you rape dogs.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness is none other than Love made manifest.

	More generally, libertarianism arises along with Spiral stage Orange, which trumps even race. The Orange value set is fertile soil for a libertarian ideology to arise.

<p>
	No only are days, weeks, months, and years relative, time itself is an invented notion. At one point in your life you had to invent the notion of "time". Before that, time did not exist for you.
</p>

<p>
	Of course as Einstein's relativity shows, even at the physical level, there is no such thing as time. In fact, physics cannot define what time is other than in terms of velocity, which is a circular definition (as all physics definitions are).
</p>

<p>
	Which is why time seems to fly when you're not thinking about it, and seems to crawl when you're wishing it would go faster. You are imagining time.

There's no appreciation of the complexity of human societies, cities, nations, businesses, courts, international trade, warfare, diplomacy, culture, education system, etc. There is no systems thinking. In the libertarian mind everyone is just an individual actor doing whatever he wants as long as it doesn't hurt others.

<p>
	Because to be a libertarian requires an enormously previleged life. You have to be so disconnected from the realities of survival that you are clueless about things like racism, rape, abuse, exploitation, slavery, corruption, war, warlords, tribal warfare, gangs, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It sure helps to be a young white male who grew up in the suburbs of America where no one had much of a chance to exploit you.

</p>

<p>
	Ultimate reality cannot be framed in terms of any dualistic statement.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot say, "Reality is like X and not Y." Because reality includes X and Y and transcends both. Both X and Y are imaginary.

	Grasp this, so you stop asking endless silly questions.

<p>
	You're in a place of confusion because you've only licked the surface of what awakening is. A lot more trips and a lot more contemplation is required to make sense of your trips and come to peace with them.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with how the ego-mind tries to interpret awakening experiences.
</p>

<p>
	If you watch my video: The Many Facets Of Awakening, it can help you make sense of your experiences.

<p>
	You simply need a lot more experience socializing with women.
</p>

<p>
	You're not gonna get good with women by sitting at home thinking about it. Go socialize. You will learn from your mistakes in the field.

<title>Is Software Developer a low social status job?</title>

<p>
	There's nothing wrong with being a software developer. Just don't advertise yourself as such when in the process of wooing women. Don't talk about your job at all. Find other ways to build attraction until she is curious enough to ask you. If a girl really likes you she will naturally ask about your work at some point. You can even use this opportunity to tease her by telling her you do some stupid job like collecting used soda cans by the highway or cleaning toilets at Taco Bell.
</p>

<p>
	Then when you tell her you're a software developer, she will be thrilled.
</p>

<p>
	Be a bit mysterious. Don't give away too much of yourself too fast.
</p>

<p>
	There are certain dangers to activating kundalini without knowing what you're doing. Which is why you should study and learn how to do it and what the dangers are.
</p>

<p>
	But also you should understand that just because you get initiation does not mean you will now avoid the potential dangers of kundalini. You can still have all the same problems even if Sadhguru himself initiates you.

<p>
	Definitely leave "software developer" out of your profile. You ain't gonna attract girls with that.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously do not lie about it if she asks you point blank what you do, but your profile needs to be human, charming, emotional -- not full of anti-social nerd speak.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, girls don't give a damn what you do for a living as long as you're able to hold down a job and pay your bills. She will get attracted to your personality, not your career.
</p>

<p>
	Your profile needs to show (not tell) that you have social savvy and are into human things which don't include computers, video games, TV, and internet.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is so radical it cannot be found on your current plane of consciousness. No amount of thinking will allow you to understand how the mind constructs reality.
</p>

<p>
	The very notion of "things happened in the past" is something Universal Mind is imaging right now.

<p>
	The past is imagined in the present. This is crucial to notice.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine that your body came out of your mother. Imagination is indistiguishable from reality. So by imagining it hard enough it becomes real from your POV. But it has no absolute reality. Your body's birth is a relative truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you stop imagining you have a mother, you will literally not have a mother. Amazing but true.

You keep conflating relative and absolute domains in contexts which are clearly relative.
</p>

<p>
	What OP needs to become conscious of is that his notions of good/bad, right/wrong are self-biased and totally relative, invented by his ego-mind to aid survival of the ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	This is a crucial realization for liberation. Without this realization one will forever remain judgmental and enslaves to social conditioning.
</p>

<p>
	No peace is possible so long as one believes in right and wrong.

<p>
	Morality is something your mind invented to aid its survival. Which is obvious if you just reflect a little. This is why no two people agree on what is right and wrong. For everything you think is evil, there will be at least one person who thinks it is good.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you are so gullible you believe your own mind's biases.

	Loopholes can be closed. It's not like corporations can escape taxation if we really wanted to tax them. A wealth tax is not necessary. We could simply create a new tax on all corporate profits. We know the profits of all publically traded companies so this is not something they could run away from or hide.
</p>

<p>
	We could also have special taxes on business transactions between large corporations.
</p>

<p>
	There could be a merger tax, where the gov gets large tax if one business buys another one.
</p>

I would do a full UBI for everyone and tax gaint corporations more to pay for it. Simple and clean. I don't understand why Yang can't be so straight forward about it. This makes me suspicious of him.

	Yang's UBI is regressive is some ways. That was Anna's point. And it's a valid point. Why not give people on disability the full UBI? People who earn $1 billion a year will get the full UBI but people on disability will not???

<p>
	It makes no sense!

<title>Why is there a duality instead of triality?</title>

<p>
	Fundamentally duality is created by one division. One division is the bare minimum to break oneness. Duality refers to any number of divisions beyond one. Duality includes triality and anything other than oneness.

	Dark night of the soul. It is normal for the ego-mind to go through a fit here.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel depressed about meaninglessness, you're still giving it meaning. Your work is not complete. There is deeper to go.
</p>

<p>
	Be ware of taking on ideas like meaninglessness or infinity. These things are not ideas.

</blockquote>

<p>
	First of all, we have little idea of what techniques Jesus taught. Many of them may have been lost to history.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, the techiques are not important as long as one reaches nondual consciousness. Whatever works is fine. I support any technique that gets one there, as long as it doesn't harm others.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like Jesus did a 30 day vision quest, fasting out in the desert. That's hardcore, but a well-known technique. That is like meditation on steroids.

<p>
	I have no faith that she will fight hard for serious progressive domestic reforms. She hardly talks about them. All she talks about is war and military issues.
</p>

<p>
	She's fairly conservative in her outlook.
</p>

<p>
	I trust that Bernie or Warren will not start any wars. So what's the point of Tulsi? Not starting war is like the bare minimum in a candidate. I don't sense that she has any original domestic plans. If she does, she hasn't communicated it.
