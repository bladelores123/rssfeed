			What are you implying Leo? Trump's going to start a war with Iran? Trump's going to start a nuclear holocaust?

<p>
	No, I'm not implying anything per se. I'm just assessing Trump's mind. He has the type of mind that will take down the ship with it if it goes down.
</p>

<p>
	I don't foresee a nuclear holocaust. But some phony war is within the realm of possibility.
</p>

<p>
	And more importantly he is going to wage a battle domestically this coming election cycle. It's gonna get nastier and dirtier than ever as his chances of reelection shrink. He will rally and whip up his base into an ideological frenzy. There will be even more conspiracy theories, demonization of decent people, and probably some degree of violence as things get desperate for Trump's base and they start to lash out.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to understand about Trump's base is that they're all-in. They will never admit defeat or any wrong-doing -- because it will be too ugly for them to admit. So they will double-down and scapegoat someone else -- like immigrants, Muslims, socialists, women, or whoever. As the failures of the Trump admin keep getting worse, the scapegoating will keep getting worse.
</p>

<p>
	The Trump phenomenon is like a giant swollen pimple that needs to burst. How bad it gets is hard to say. We have to be careful, but also don't get overly pessimistic. This is all part of the nation's growth process. It is all necessary to evolve to the next level. Just be careful not to get caught up in the eruption.
</p>

<title>Awakening possible while on SSRI ?</title>

			I have serious panic disorder based on hypochondria and the fear of death. My plan for ultimately getting off them is firstly in depth psychoanalysis and simultaneously doing consciousness work, meditation, self inquiry and yoga in order to ultimately reach enlightenment, go through the experience of being absolute infinity, realize I'm not the same as this body so I don't have to obsess over defending its existence.
		</p>

		<p>
			Edit: My pursuit of enlightenment though is different, it starts from curiosity more than a need to heal. Honestly ssri's are doing a wonderful job at the moment with zero to little side effects and I am back to an almost fully functional state, so in a sense they solve the problem. I could go on SSRI's and never have another panic attack. I want to pursuit the truth, being healed from my trauma is for me something a little more secondary.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	So what this tells me is you got A LOT of work to do before anything like enlightenment will dawn. Probably years of work.
</p>

<p>
	That's okay, but what I mean is, you don't have to worry too much about enlightenment right now. Focus building up your meditation skills, psychoanalysis, yoga, etc. All of that will build up your foundation. At some point you should begin to slowly ween yourself off the medication and pursue the Truth full-bore.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is about facing your own death. So you need to build yourself up to the point where you're not having panic attacks and you a ready to face ego dissolution. You are not going to be able to avoid facing death. That is the whole aim of enlightenment work. Enlightenment is all about facing your deepest fears and seeing through them with extraordinary levels of consciousness and concentration.
</p>

<p>
	Weening yourself off SSRI's will also allow you to play around with psychedelics -- which are one of the most effective tools for facing death and fear.

<title>Meditation Question - Thoughts vs Insight</title>

What are you trying to understand or get?
</p>

<p>
	Sits are usually not nearly as effective without a clear intention. It's very important to become clear about what you want out of this work. And there are many things you could be working on / developing / realizing.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to just sit and done nothing, without any objective or goal. Fine. But then make that your intention and be clear about it: "I will just sit here like a cat and be in the present moment."
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes that's effective.
</p>

<p>
	Other times it's more effective to have some existential question you're working on, like "What am I?" or "What is reality?" or "What is Love?" or "What is Truth?", etc.
</p>

<p>
	But understand this: there is way more to this work than merely sitting like a cat. Nothing wrong with sitting like a cat. But if you really want to understand reality, life, and self -- that won't be enough. You need to probe various aspects of life to crack its secrets.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could be working on building concentration skill.
</p>

<title>Amazing Scaramucci Realization</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/38206-amazing-scaramucci-realization/?do=findComment&amp;comment=479094</link>

<p>
	I was amazed by this interview because in it Scaramucci (a stage Blue/Orange Wall Street guy) finally realizes Trump's stage Red nature. And finally he turns on Trump.
</p>

<p>
	The key moment happens right at the 0:30 mark. He realizes that Trump is not evolved enough to be genuinely racist because he's too much of a stage Red opportunist.
</p>

<p>
	It's the most amazing back-handed compliment I've ever heard, LOL:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqAhFqah2Pw?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	A great lesson in psychology and Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	It's also very revealing that Scaramucci saw Trump's opportunism in the flesh, but it never bothered him until now. Which is exactly right. Stage Orange itself tends to be opportunistic without much remorse or foresight of the problems that such unchecked opportunism leads to.
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem with putting a shameless opportunist into office is that he won't hesitate to start a war if it helps him get reelected. The more cornered such a person becomes, the more dangerous he becomes because his only concern is his own survival.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump goes down, he will take the entire ship with him.
</p>

<p>
	Every stage has healthy & unhealthy aspects.
</p>

<p>
	What are the unhealthy aspects of Green?
</p>

<p>
	Sit down by yourself and list all of them out. Then compare to Green news sources like TYT. You will see a nice match if you do the exercise properly.
</p>

<p>
	But you're gonna have to step outside your own personal opinions and biases to do this exercise correctly.

<p>
	That only holds true for Green IF the other side is tolerant and non-oppressive.
</p>

<p>
	Green does not tolerate oppressive versions of stage Blue or Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Green will often viciously demonize capitalism or Wall Street, for example. Green can even be violent against oppression, as in the case of eco-terrorism, PETA, GreenPeace, and Antifa.
</p>

<p>
	Please educate yourself.

<p>
	No. That is incorrect. You need to study the Spiral Dynamics theory more. Go read the SD book or the works of Ken Wilber.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber wrote an entire book about the "Mean Green Meme". Green precisely demonizes Orange and lower stages.

			It's tribalism and absolutism. They are blue/green to be more precise. But there is definitely an "us against them" mentality and black and white thinking - that is stage blue. They are, ironically, stage blue about stage green topics.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, you misunderstand Green.
</p>

<p>
	Green is precisely tribalistic against oppressors. Green does not embrace those who are intolerant, like racists or authoritarians. Which is why Green dislikes Trump so much. They cannot stomach his bullying of people and his divisiveness.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a collectivist stage which comes with some group-think and dogmas. This doesn't make it Blue. Green dogma is quite different from Blue dogma. Overall, Green is much better at dealing with multiculturalism. Green is not nationalist or racist. Blue is.
</p>

<p>
	Green is not so evolved that it will be understanding of racism. That requires Yellow and above.

<p>
	Actually, that's part of Green. Green sees Blue & Orange as evil sometimes.
</p>

<p>
	To stop seeing Blue & Orange as evil requires Tier 2 Yellow perspective, which of course Green lacks.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, Trump supporters are not the sharpest tools in the shed. Have you watched some videos of Trump rallies? Of Trump supporters being interviewed? It's beyond deplorable:

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not enough to resonate with Blue or Orange. One has to transcend them.
</p>

<p>
	I can make YT videos that resonate with stage Blue and feed their worst racist impulses, leading them towards Nazism.
</p>

<p>
	I can make YT videos that resonate with stage Orange Wall Street types and help them to further exploit society and 3rd world countries with sweatshops.
</p>

<p>
	Fearmongering (as JP like to do) is not an effective way to lead people up the Spiral. How can you elevate stag Blue & Orange people to the next stage -- Green -- when you fearmonger about feminists, post-modernists, relativism, LGBTQ, environmentalists, hippies, Marxists, socialists, and communists??? That sends a message to stage Blue & Orange: "Don't bother going Green. Green is delusional and dangerous. Stay Blue & Orange."
</p>

<p>
	Conscious leaderships requires pointing out the limitations and dysfunctions <u>of the current stage</u>, not the future stage. For JP to lead people out of Blue & Orange he would have to be talking about the limitations and problems of Blue & Orange. Instead he talks about the limits of Green. Talking about the limits of Green is only helpful if you and your audience is at least Green.
</p>

<p>
	JP denies the seriousness of climate change. That alone tells you the danger of his ideology.
</p>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13282-zizzero/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13282" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13282-zizzero/" rel="">@Zizzero</a> Many of these sources certainly have a bias.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that Tier 2 political sources basically don't exist. We live in the real world, where stage Green politics and news is about as advanced as it gets (for now).
</p>

<p>
	TYT is leading an effort to get money out of politics. Show me one other source which is doing that? Show me one right-wing commentator or channel which is vocally advocating for removing all money from politics or passing a Constitutional Amendment to remove money from politics.
</p>

<p>
	Like I told you before, both sides are not equal.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be able to watch these sources while at the same time being aware of their their biases (and your biases).
</p>

<p>
	And you always have to consider: what's the alternative? You gonna watch CNN? Fox News? What? You gonna stick your head in the sand and do nothing? All those alternatives are worse.
</p>

<p>
	Despite whatever biases they have, TYT is serving a very important function in promoting uncorrupted democrats who take no corporate PAC money or big dollar donors. Nothing like that exists anywhere else right now. If you can't appreciate the value of that, that's your bias clouding your vision.
</p>

<p>
	TYT elected one of the most conscious, empathetic, and uncorrupted congresswomen ever: AOC.
</p>

<p>
	TYT is actually the cutting edge of politics in America.
</p>

<p>
	Any threads which aren't up to par will simply be moved to the Sefl-Actualization or Spirituality sub-forums.
</p>

<p>
	That should work well.
</p>

<p>
	Once we get a lot of threads, we might elect a dedicated Mod to curate that sub-forum and make it pretty with good formatting. If anyone is interested in that job, get in touch with me. A track record of mature forum behavior is required.

<p>
	I've had this idea for a long time of leveraging the collective creative effort of this forum.
</p>

<p>
	I feel that a lot of our creative potential is lost here in talking and debating. A much better use of our time would be to work collectively to create the world's greatest database of self-actualization & spirituality resources. As you guys study self-actualization and spirituality you will naturally stumble upon life-changing resources which often go forgotten and unshared.
</p>

<p>
	I have been wanting to find a way to channel your guys' expertise and creativity towards some higher purpose.
</p>

<p>
	Now we have a new sub-forum dedicate to this purpose. It will be a heavily moderated sub-forum. Please read the Guidelines there before posting. It's important that we maintain a high quality threshold on this sub-forum.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/32-high-consciousness-resources/" rel="">https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/32-high-consciousness-resources/</a>
</p>

<p>
	I look forward to seeing some great contributions.
</p>

<p>
	Let me know what you think about this idea.
</p>

<title>High Consciousness Resources Guidelines</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/32-high-consciousness-resources/">High Consciousness Resources</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	This sub-forum is meant to be unlike other sub-forums. Only start a thread here if you have a high quality conscious resource to share. The resource could be a link, a video, a website, a podcast, an interview, a TED talk, etc. But it must be some external resource link. Do not just start a thread here about some opinion you have. Your link must also be relatively high quality and related to consciousness work / inner work / self-actualization.
</p>

<p>
	The vision for this sub-forum is that over time we will build an amazing list of the highest consciousness videos, interviews, podcasts, teachings, and links on the web. Think of this like a collectively curated list of the best of the best teachings. A newbie who browses this sub-forum should consistently strike gold.
</p>

<p>
	This is community-created resource list which gives our members a chance to make a positive, long-lasting contribution to the forum rather than just debate or talk. Think of this like a Self-Actualization & Spirituality Wikipedia.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		All threads in this sub-forum will be heavily curated by Mods to make sure they truly belong here.
	</li>
	<li>
		Discussions of the linked resource are allowed and welcomed inside the relevant thread.
	</li>
	<li>
		Do not start a thread in this sub-forum unless you have some external resource to link.
	</li>
	<li>
		Try to keep politics out of this sub-forum. We have a dedicated Politics sub-forum for political resources.
	</li>
	<li>
		Do not link Actualized.org videos here. That is redundant.
	</li>
	<li>
		This is not a place for self-promotion.
	</li>
	<li>
		Give your post a good descriptive title, so people know what they're clicking on.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	It's important that we maintain a high quality threshold for content in this sub-forum in the same way that Wikipedia does.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some ideas for threads to get your mind jogging:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		The Best Of.... XXXXXX (replace XXXXX with any quality spiritual teacher: Osho, Ekhart, Spira, Mooji, etc.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Resources For Addiction Recovery
	</li>
	<li>
		Resources For Kriya Yoga
	</li>
	<li>
		Science & Spirituality Intersects
	</li>
	<li>
		Top Muslim/Sufi Spiritual Resources
	</li>
	<li>
		Top Christian Spiritual Resources
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Schools Of Yoga
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Hatha Yoga Online Programs
	</li>
	<li>
		List Of Top Meditation Teachers
	</li>
	<li>
		List Of Top Spiritual Retreat Centers
	</li>
	<li>
		Conscious Sexuality Resources
	</li>
	<li>
		Best TED Talks Relevant To Spirituality
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Psychology Lectures
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Philosophy Lectures
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Environmentalism Podcasts
	</li>
	<li>
		Best Marketing Courses
	</li>
	<li>
		Top Resources For Starting Your Own Business
	</li>
	<li>
		Motivational Talks
	</li>
	<li>
		Top Resources For Building A Powerful Morning Routine
	</li>
	<li>
		Top YT Fitness Channels
	</li>
	<li>
		Top Online Indian Gurus
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	As you can see, there's enormous potential here.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Post here links to YT channels, podcasts, & websites which offer high quality political analysis.
</p>

<p>
	High quality political analysis is:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Systemic, complex, nuanced
	</li>
	<li>
		Holistic
	</li>
	<li>
		Questions the status quo, calls out corruption, speaks truth to power
	</li>
	<li>
		Non-blaming, non-demonizing, non-conspiratorial
	</li>
	<li>
		Grounded in facts & evidence
	</li>
	<li>
		Grounded in historical understanding
	</li>
	<li>
		Grounded in solid non-partisan journalism
	</li>
	<li>
		Attempts to be fair to the other side, avoids strawmanning the other side
	</li>
	<li>
		Non-dogmatic, open-minded, willing to change its mind on issues
	</li>
	<li>
		Not overly focused on culture war issues
	</li>
	<li>
		Shows empathy for all humans and living beings, regardless of race, ethnicity, class, gender, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Advocates for non-violence as much as possible
	</li>
	<li>
		Doesn't fear-monger
	</li>
	<li>
		Doesn't scapegoat gays, non-whites, communists, globalists, Jews, feminists, academics, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Appreciates cultural diversity and different POVs
	</li>
	<li>
		In-depth rather than merely sound bites
	</li>
	<li>
		Cares about environmental issues
	</li>
	<li>
		Appreciates the importance of balance
	</li>
	<li>
		Understands the dangers of false equivalency and "neutrality"
	</li>
	<li>
		Interested in unearthing root causes of problems
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Yes! These can be tough subjective calls to make. Self-bias is always a distorting factor.
</p>

<title>Conscious Politics Guidelines</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/38162-conscious-politics-guidelines/?do=findComment&amp;comment=478968</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	This sub-forum is for discussing all aspects of Conscious Politics. This includes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Governments across the world
	</li>
	<li>
		Analysis of important current events
	</li>
	<li>
		Environmental concerns
	</li>
	<li>
		Culture Wars
	</li>
	<li>
		Collective issues which affect all of society
	</li>
	<li>
		Systemic social problems, inequality, injustice, oppression, wage slavery, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ideas for how to improve society & government
	</li>
	<li>
		Discussing elections, candidates, political analysis
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Please keep in mind that this is a naturally controversial topic. Watch your self-bias, ideology, and devilry extra closely as you think about and talk about these issues. These issues are emotionally charged precisely because they go to the core of your identity & survival. Don't turn this sub-forum into a distraction from inner work.
</p>

<p>
	This sub-forum will be heavily moderated for devilry and toxic forms of ideology. The following are not allowed:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Conspiracy theories
	</li>
	<li>
		Racism, nationalism, fascism, sexism, homophobia, xenophobia, Islamophobia
	</li>
	<li>
		Spreading propaganda videos. Sources like Fox News, PragerU, etc. will be considered propaganda. (You can link them if you are debunking them.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Threats of violence, inciting violent uprising
	</li>
	<li>
		Arguing that some races or ethnicities are biologically or fundamentally inferior to others (by citing IQ differences, etc.)
	</li>
	<li>
		Posting violently graphic videos (terrorist attack videos, etc.)
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This sub-forum is meant to be a nuanced (Spiral Dynamics Tier 2) discussion of politics, not a culture war. Discuss political issues from a systemic level.
</p>

<p>
	Be here with an open mind. Be here to learn. If you are just here spreading your pet ideology you will probably end up banned. Make your arguments without resorting to personal insults, name-calling, or strawmanning. Be nuanced and understanding of the complexities of social issues. Things are rarely black & white in this domain. Usually every POV has some degree of partial truth so it's a matter of carefully sorting through the nuances.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, the issue isn't Left vs Right, the issue is low vs high consciousness, low vs high development, fear vs love, selfishness vs selflessness, dogma vs objectivity, ignorance vs education.
</p>

<title>Warning: Recruiting To Chat Not Allowed</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/38160-warning-recruiting-to-chat-not-allowed/?do=findComment&amp;comment=478952</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Using this forum to recruit members to private chat groups like Discord, Skype, WhatsApp, etc. is against Forum Guidelines.
</p>

<p>
	Such groups splinter the community and can easily turn toxic as the activity happens in the shadows without moderation or oversight. Such groups can become very cult-like.
</p>

<p>
	If you are caught creating or participating in such things your account will probably end up insta-banned.
</p>

<p>
	Please keep in mind, Administrators have the ability to monitor your Private Messages. Moderators do not have such an ability. I try not stick my nose into PMs, but I do occasionally scan them for devilish activity. This is unfortunately a necessity as people will occasionally abuse the PM system in serious ways.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is to keep our discussions of Self-Actualization centered here, out in the public. Otherwise the community fractures into factions.
</p>

<p>
	If someone contacts you to join a private group, please report such people to me.
</p>

<title>can't fall asleep after 5meo bad trip, it's been 4 days please help</title>

<p>
	Sounds to me like the 5-MeO opened you up and now you're going through a classic "spiritual emergency" as Stan Grof calls it.
</p>

<p>
	This is a normal part of the waking up process. Of course it can feel hairy when you're in the thick of it.
</p>

<p>
	You might want to read up on Stan Grof's work on "spiritual emergencies".  Most people don't get them, but plenty do as they get deeper into this work.
</p>

<p>
	I would try to frame this as a positive. Clearly you were very sensitive and that trip unlocked something in you. The process is just happening so fast that you feel overwhelmed. Try to roll with it and become curious about what is happening to you, rather than trying to stop it or trying to go back to your old life.
</p>

<p>
	The resistance and worry is largely what causes the suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, this work involves undergoing significant change. Have faith in the process. This should help you calm down and roll with the punches.
</p>

<p>
	The 5-MeO is long out of your system. This is simply you starting to wake up. The ego mind can resist the process in all sorts of creative and dysfunctional ways.
</p>

	Truthority has been banned from this forum.
</p>

<p>
	It is obvious he will keep creating distractions if he was allowed to stay.
</p>

<p>
	I swear, after managing this place for 3 years, it's getting too easy to spot the troublemakers before they even get warmed up. So I am less oepn to giving them second chances these days.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like banning people, but it comes with the territory.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I've noticed a good clue that some new member is likely a devil: his username will contain a word such a Truth, Enlightenment, Consciousness, Infinity, or some noble phase like "The Awakened One" or "I Love Truth". It's a classic sign of a devil to co-opt such terms. If the username sounds too noble, be very suspicious.

	There are just far too many higher quality sources you could be learning from.

Truthful insights can be hard for the ego to accept. If you're doing psychedelics the one thing you can know for sure is that they will reveal things about you & reality which you will find disturbing and uncomfortable.

	Can you delude yourself? Always! Delusion has been your way of life since your imaginary birth.

Of course I have no idea how you will handle it psychologically.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like you're fairly tolerant to it, so even up to 40mg might be required. But go slow.
</p>

<p>
	With 5-MeO-DMT there are actually several levels of breakthrough. The first breakthrough is just the beginning (child's play really).
</p>

<p>
	I might get a breakthrough at 20mg but then a crazy new kind of breakthrough at 30mg.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you're still far off from that.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, freebase seems more potent per volume.

</p>

<p>
	JP certainly does not know what Truth is. Neither does Sam Harris.
</p>

<p>
	JP's discussion about Truth with Sam Harris is a joke. Two blind men arguing about an elephant they've never seen.
</p>

<p>
	If JP just simply taught Jungian psychology, that would be fine. But he sticks his nose in all sorts of other issues outside his understanding. He speaks about Marxism, for example, without any sign of having read or studied Marx.

<p>
	Technically, "cultural Marxism" is a conspiracy theory which long predates JP.

He does not understand what meaning is, what a symbol is, what science is, what religion is, what God is, what language is, what consciousness, what morality is, what evil is, what being is, what mind is, what body is, what thought is, what mysticisim is, what gender is, what ego is, what truth is.

<p>
	Again. Lol
</p>

<p>
	JP is being called out on his bullshit, devilry, and demonization of feminism, SJWs, socialism, Marxism, and Green.
</p>

<p>
	JP built his entire career demonizing Green. So please spare me the "poor JP" BS. 
</p>

<p>
	You guys still have a lot of growing up to do before you understand Green.
</p>

<p>
	I understand that JP cannot help being the devil that he is. So in the absolute sense I have love for him. But in the relative sense I will still call him out on his devilry because the ideology he spreads is dangerous and toxic.
</p>

<p>
	Do not expect me to be neutral towards devils just to placate you. I will call out devilry where I see it.

<p>
	Individualism vs collectivism is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Neither one is an absolute good. They must be balanced of course.
</p>

<p>
	But practically, in American society there is a massive cultural resistance to stage Green collectivism and over-glorification of individualism. Ironically this resistance is itself collective.
</p>

<p>
	So when I push people towards collectivism, it's not because I think collectivism is the end goal, it's because I'm trying to balance out the stage Orange libertarian and capitalist attitude which has lodged itself in the minds of many people today.
</p>

<p>
	It is a mistake to worry too much about the excesses of collectivism when right now our society is reeling from the excesses of individualism. So while you speak of balance, you're out of balance.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Sometimes reality is rude to one's fantasies.
</p>

<p>
	When we talk about conservatives we are talking in gross generalities. It is simply the case that *on average* the conservative mind is less developed and less conscious than the liberal mind. If you disagree with this, you need to make a deep study of the conservative mind and developmental psychology.
</p>

<p>
	This seems unfair to you -- I understand -- but you have to stop assuming false equivalencies.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a left vs right issue. This is consciousness issue.
</p>

<p>
	Again, you must be very careful not to project your self-bias onto what I'm saying. Your self-bias is going to make it seem like I am being self-biased. Don't confuse your self-bias with my own.
</p>

<p>
	All of this is extremely advanced stuff. It's extremely self-deceptive. I am not making partisan points here even though it might seem like I am. I am talking about meta things which, for the most part, no one on Earth understands or has ever talked about. It will take you years of study and consciousness work to understand the things I'm saying and why I say them.

I really don't think they should be fighting instead they should be sharing their best ideas with each other. I just think that Sanders was good for the 20th Century and we've passed that Yang is good for the 21st Century but, that's just my bias and I understand that with in myself that's why I'm open to suggestions and other points of view. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This thread is not the best place for that discussion.
</p>

<p>
	In brief, I agree that Yang and Sanders should not be fighting each other. Nor are they. Their ideas largely dovetail. Sanders is too advanced even for the 21st century. We are nowhere near "passed that". We are just warming up. Yang is part of the warm up.
</p>

<p>
	Yang is not going after corporate corruption as directly as Sanders is. Yang's over-focused on UBI as a cure-all at the expense of a solid welfare system.
</p>

<p>
	Again, I am not opposed to Yang per se. If he were president that would be a huge step forward for America. But I see Bernie Sanders as an MLK or FDR type figure who can lead a true social movement unlike anyone else. He has the balls to do it. The status quo is most threatened by Sanders. Because they intuit that he will call out their selfishness and greed unlike anyone else.
</p>

<p>
	The polar opposite of Trump is not an Asian guy who knows math. It's Bernie Sanders -- who will attack the very heart of late-stage capitalism. This attack is badly needed to shift the center of gravity of our culture.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to discuss this further, start a dedicated thread.

<p>
	There is value in learning about masculine and feminine ways of life.
</p>

<p>
	But also, that is just one way to partitioning reality. So be careful not to get hung up on that daulity. It is a duality in the end.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness itself is not masculine or feminine. But from a human perspective it is useful to experiment with masculine vs feminine approaches to life and spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	A heart-centered, love-based path can be very powerful. But it also needs to grounded in direct realization of Truth.

<p>
	Again, the problem is with how you're defining "I". The I of which you speak is the illusory ego.
</p>

<p>
	The true I, God, has an infinite number of lives because it is all things.
</p>

<p>
	Your life is imaginary. It isn't really yours. You've mistaken the universe for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like when you say, "This is my cat." But in truth, that cat does not belong to you. You can't really own a cat. Only in your imagination.

<p>
	I've said before that different people need different paths, so respect their differences because not everyone is like you.
</p>

<p>
	There are not just two paths, there are more.

<p>
	Your question has a subtle duality as its premise.
</p>

<p>
	The "you" you're assuming in that question is the ego self. The ego is not the only one.
</p>

<p>
	That is the wrong you.
</p>

<p>
	The right you is God. God is the only thinker because it is all thinkers.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, there is no difference between actuality and your imagination. So if you imagine there are others out there, that's what God creates. Since you are God.
</p>

<p>
	You are imagining the very world you interact with. You are like a paranoid madman. If you believe people are chasing after you, they are!

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, causation is a dualistic notion. To have causation requires you divide the world into causes and effects (duality).
</p>

<p>
	To say there is no causation is the same as to say there is infinite causation, because zero and infinity are identical.
</p>

<p>
	Every object has an infinite chain of causes and an infnite chain of effects. Reality is an infnite fractal of cause and effect. Every point in the web is both the beginning, the center, and the end.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could say that everything is uncaused. It's the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Because people are selfish and helping animals is outside their circle of concern.
</p>

<p>
	It does not serve a human's survival to help animals. So they mostly don't.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to care about animals when your belly is empty.
</p>

<p>
	We change this by raising collective consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	People only start caring about animals as beings at stage Green and above. Lower stages treat animals as walking resources.

<title>Dubai - Conscious politics?</title>

<p>
	I think it's great.
</p>

<p>
	Of course they have a lot more growing to do in other areas, but hey, they're growing pretty quick for the Middle East. You gotta keep in mind that all growth is relative to one's starting point and geographic & historical situation. It is incorrect to judge Dubai by American or European standards. When you compare Dubai to Iraq or Saudi Arabia you see how great it is.
</p>

<p>
	When judging countries the key is less-so judging their absolute position but their rate of growth and willingness to change.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest problems in America is that our system has become so stubborn and resistant to change.
</p>

<title>Ken Wilber talks about politics.</title>

<p>
	He's critical of Green from above. And he's mostly talking about Green as it crops up in academia.
</p>

<p>
	I think the thing he's overlooking is that our national politics is nowhere near as advanced as academia politics.
</p>

<p>
	So while it makes sense to criticize Green academia from above, this creates confusion if people try to apply this more broadly to our national discourse. The national discourse is so regressive that it's got miles to go before it reaches solid Green. By over focusing on criticism of Green Ken might inadvertently play right into the hands of the status quo and the right-wing.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to not draw a false equivalency between stuff like Fox News and excesses of academia. Whatever criticism academia deserves, stuff like Fox News deserves x10 more.
</p>

<p>
	I kinda like the sound of "Society, Environment, Politics"
</p>

<p>
	And then those of you who aren't interested in that topic would see less of those threads in the Self-Actualization and Spirituality sub-forums.

<p>
	I wonder if there's a conscious society/politics forum anywhere on the web.

<p>
	That's not a good method.
</p>

<p>
	Pick one of the following:
</p>

<p>
	1) Read your script word for word while your video shows various related imagery, not your face.
</p>

<p>
	2) Show your face but speak without a script. Speak naturally, the way you would to a friend. You could have an short outline of your key points just to keep you on track.

<p>
	What is the point of doing a job that a donkey could do?
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of machines and AI is free humans to be their most creative and artistic. But being creative and artistic requires serious development, sense of life purpose, and vision.
</p>

<p>
	Worrying about how to keep humans doing donkey-jobs is a disservice to humans. Show humans how to be fully human.

			If we were talking about 10 or 20 years I would totally agree with you but who knows what could happen in a 100 years. What is impressive about current AI research is the rate of progress. Even if most of the algorithms were to be only refined the current leverage points are compute power and data can give huge gains.

<p>
	I don't see a serious AI coming online within the next 100 years. Nothing that could rival a human's creativity or intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	There will be many AIs who are good at crunching big data sets and doing very narrow task extremely well. But this is not a rival to human creativity, vision, wisdom, leadership, consciousness, and love.

	Humans and AI can work wonderfully together, leveraging each others strengths and compensating for each others weaknesses. Think of Data from Star Trek.

<p>
	The alt-lite and alt-right YT rabbit hole is well documented to radicalize young white males.
</p>

<p>
	Young white men who resonate with JP's victim complex will definitely be suseptible to alt-right ideology.
</p>

<p>
	He is unwittingly helping to radicalize people against liberals, progressives, women, social democrats, and LGBTQ.
</p>

<p>
	PragerU and FoxNews are right wing propaganda channels, and he appears in their videos.
</p>

<p>
	Like Trump, he knows not what his words are doing.
</p>

<p>
	The alt-right desperately needs intellectuals and academics to give them an air of credibility. He fits that role.
</p>

<p>
	He is a fool's idea of an intellectual, just like Trump is a fool's idea of a rich person.

<p>
	No they won't. This is a myth.
</p>

<p>
	The US used to have a 75%+ tax rate for rich people.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot currently move away from IRS taxation. If you are a US citizen even if you move overseas you still owe the IRS money. You can't just do a bunch of business in the US while living offshore as a citizen and not pay taxes.
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention that most desirable countries have fairly high taxes.

	Most young men who follow him have no idea about the Spiral, so they will not be able to discern the limitations of his worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, these young men use his worldview to deepen and justify their toxic masculinity and hatred of feminism, creating a gateway into the alt-right, incel-ism, RedPill, white supremacy, and all that jazz.
