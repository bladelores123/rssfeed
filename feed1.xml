	Each stage integrates all the lower.
</p>

<p>
	So Turquoise already contains all the lower stages within it, but properly moderated and transcended.

<title>Doing pickup at a bar/club alone</title>

<p>
	A few good options here:
</p>

<p>
	1) "My friends are around here somewhere." [point into a large crowd], or "I'm waiting for them to show up" or "They just left. They were tired."
</p>

<p>
	2) Just own it and admit you're out alone. "I was bored at home and I felt like going out, so here I am." or "That's how I roll girl. I'm not part of some gaggle of sheep."
</p>

<p>
	3) Just ignore and change the conversation into something else, "You seem like the kind of girl who voted for Trump. Admit it! You voted for Trump, didn't you?!" or "Why are you being so racist?"
</p>

<p>
	They lose interest because you don't own your aloneness. If you think it's weird, she will think its weird. If you think its totally normal to be out at a club alone, she won't care either. But you have to keep the conversation moving. Don't just say you're alone and then let it hang. You gotta immediately follow up with some other conversation topic as if her question was nothing at all.
</p>

<p>
	In general what you're lacking here is confidence. A confident man does not let some random girl judge him or frame control him. You gotta feel that you are way cooler than her no matter how many sheepish friends are around her. Her sheep friends are all fools and so is she for herding up with them. Be the badass lone wolf. And treat everyone in the club as your friends. You can make instant friends with some random guys in the club.
</p>

<p>
	When you are in the club you gotta walk around like you are the owner of the place. Exude that kind of confidence and comfort.
</p>

<title>Less ego = more pesonality</title>

You are actually acting without egoic calculations in the moment. You are not thinking. In fact there isn't even a self in the moment. Which is why it feels so good. But these moment are rare because mostly you're thinking and calculating so much.
</p>

<p>
	Think of a moment when you are laughing hard with friends. In that moment the ego is absent. In that moment your personality shines the most.

That's what ego is mostly doing: surviving the complex social persona of you. And it's doing it perfectly. All of your thoughts are about that.

<p>
	That's exactly what I'm saying.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of a symbol is such that for it to serve as a symbol is its being must be overlooked. If a symbol's being is recognized, then it stop being a symbol and becomes being/Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The word cat is not itself a cat. Because of this, the Truth cannot be symbolized. Truth is prior to symbols. Truth cannot be pointed at because any pointer is already itself the Truth, but not recognized to be so.

But your body would still have preferences. It has instinctive programming to avoid stuff which endangers survival. So in practice you will survive just fine because your body has an intelligence of its own and it's not going to do something as stupid as sawing your own leg off. But at the same time, you will be at peace with the prospect of the body dying. You can survive without being attached to survival.
</p>

<p>
	What happens to the body become irrelevant when you're conscious enough because you're so conscious you know that you're not limited to the body. The body is like clothing you are wearing. The body is God's jacket.

	How can you move away from being when being is all there is and no matter where you move, you're still being. Desire and movement ARE being. <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />

	It's actually more radical than that. You can achieve a state of consciousness so total that you realize you always ARE doing precisely what you want. So if someone is sawing your leg off, you can be conscious that you (as God) are doing that to yourself. Because EVERYTHING that happens is God's Will and it is all Absolutely Good and done out of pure Love. It is a love that you as a human cannot fathom or embody because it is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	When you are that conscious, there is no need to exert your own personal human will. Whatever happens, however it happens, becomes fine by you because you realize THAT is your will.
</p>

<p>
	By defintion, anything that happens is your will. Not your human will, but your God's Will.
</p>

<p>
	Your personal will must be surrendered completely so that whatever the universe does becomes your will.

<title>Leo, If Reality is an Imagination Why do some imaginations overlap and others don't?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/36065-leo-if-reality-is-an-imagination-why-do-some-imaginations-overlap-and-others-dont/?do=findComment&amp;comment=445722</link>

<p>
	There are many levels to imagination. Some imagination is very surface level, like when you imagine the Earth is flat. Some imagination is very deep, like when you imagine that you were born or that your parents are real.
</p>

<p>
	Most of your imagination is outside your personal human will, therefore you call it "physical reality" or "other". What you mean here is that it's other to you as an ego self. But as God you have locked your out from your own full power so that you could create this limit human form. Sort of like how a computer OS can lock out applications from accessing all of a computer's internals, for security purposes.
</p>

<p>
	You are not currently in a state of consciousness which gives you access to your own deepest levels of imagination. You only have access to the "human" levels right now. Until you change your state.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like you're world class genius who uses his genius to act like a retarded person. Your act is so convincing that you actually think you're retarded when in fact you are a genius with an infinite IQ.
</p>

<p>
	It became quickly obvious to me when I was about 21 years old that a university would not accept my radical epistemology because it would be the death of the university.

	Creating new paths is what I enjoy. I have little interest in walking other people's paths.

<p>
	Language only works for sharing common experiences. You cannot communicate something which another person has never experienced. So what we need to get more people having more mystical experiences easily.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why psychedelics are the best way of creating a common spiritual language. But of course they are demonized precisely for this reason.

<p>
	I mostly just release the videos which I feel motivated to release. I don't calculate too much about it. But of course, that's because I have that luxury. If you're just starting off you have to be much more calculating. In my early days I released a lot of videos which were not my favorite topics but which I knew would be popular mainstream topics.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, of course all others ultimately equals self. But when you run into a grizzly bear in the woods you don't say to yourself, "No big deal. That's just myself."
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with mixing relative and absolute domains.
</p>

<p>
	If aliens exist, that's still significant to human life, even though we are all of course one.
</p>

<p>
	To call an alien an ego projection is as silly as calling a grizzly bear an ego projection. Aliens can have valuable lessons to share. And they are worthwhile in their own right, simply by virtue of being aliens. If aliens are real, communing with them is a worthwhile activity. As worthwhile as any other activity.

<p>
	It does change you for sure, but in subtle ways.

<p>
	Mostly what I have gained in not equanimity but understanding, humility, love, God, authenticity, wonder, and overcoming the fear of death. The body is more at ease too.

<p>
	When you become fully conscious you'll realize brains are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Animals are also something you are hallucinating.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a video game character has a brain does not mean the brain is running the simulation. The brain is part of the simulation.

So it's necessarily tricky and contentious.

<p>
	Yes, it's all God's imagination. But you are God, so it's your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	It's not all "ego stuff" any more than you seeing a cat walking down the street is "ego stuff". That's not ego, it's the "world".
</p>

<p>
	Some people who trip can of course do so in a dualistic way, where they might see an alien and assume that this alien is somehow "other" to them. But that alien is just like any other being in "real life". It is BOTH an entity other than you, but also it is you, since all people are you.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at the world dualistically, other people are not you.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at the world nondualistically, other people are all your own projections.
</p>

<p>
	There's really no contradiction. Both are true in a sense.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you trip with a weak spiritual foundation the ego can co-opt the trips and do a lot of egoic stuff and projecting. So you have to be careful about self-deception. Just like you do in "real life."
</p>

<p>
	But seeing a DMT entity is not ego any more than seeing a cat is.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course, this is a key issue which so many people get wrong. Most people are unconsciously acting out either an individualist dogma or a collectivist dogma without realizing that these are two mutually-interdependent forces which must be carefully balanced. See video: Aztec Nonduality, where I discuss the central importance of balance.
</p>

<p>
	A big part of conscious politics is recognizing that delicate balances must be struck between capitalism & socialism, individualism vs collectivism, freedom & limitation, and status quo & progress. None of these can be taken as absolute goods. Any philosophy or ideology which takes an absolutist position on any one of these is misguided, Tier 1, and will ultimately fail. Yin and yang must be balanced. But not necessarily down the middle. Balance is a complex and dynamic process, not the mid-point between any two positions.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I also stress that difference.
</p>

<p>
	And I also stress the difference between awakening and things like cognitive development, moral development, and other developmental lines.
</p>

<p>
	You can be deeply enlightened but still deficient in cognitive development and other important things.
</p>

<p>
	Post-awakening pathologies are very common. An entire book could be written about them.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I really dislike defining "enlightenment" as total perfection. Once people get that definition in their heads, they start to expect perfection from their fave nondual teachers and then get shocked when they see their fave teacher/guru fall short of that standard because that standard is virtually impossible to meet even after 40 years of practice.
</p>

<p>
	Even when Christ was nailed to the cross he said, "Father, why have you forsaken me?" This was a very human response to a horrific situation. And I'm sure he suffered deeply.
</p>

<p>
	So to set up a standard for students that even Christ could not meet is not wise.
</p>

<p>
	And of course 5-MeO-DMT will never give anyone such an extraordinary degree of perfect equanimity permanently. Although during a 5-MeO-DMT peak, I have had that degree of perfect equanimity, where pain and pleasure are literally indistinguishable. But it will not last.

<p>
	It's not just a matter of being scared. I can do 5-MeO-DMT without being scared.

<p>
	My direct experience and wisdom says otherwise.

<p>
	One of the upsides of Bernie is that he has 40 years of government/politics experience. A lot of newer Democrats in this primary have some good ideas, but they are just inexperienced with how Washington really works. That's important to take into account. That's one of Yang's downsides for example. Same with Williamson. I worry such people might be somewhat naive about the whole thing.
</p>

<p>
	I would like to see a special law passed which seriously protects and even actively encourages whistler-blowers to come forward. It's gross how whistler-blowers are attacked for revealing deep truths. That's pure devilry. Whistler-blowers must be celebrated as heroes.

<p>
	No one is claiming this either. Self-deception is always at work. Perfect clarity is not how this work works. We are doing the best we can under conditions of limited knowledge and various biases.
</p>

<p>
	The issue I have with your advancing of "enlightenment" is that you're stuck on this notion of mastery or total enlightenment as you've chosen to define it, and dismissing anything shy of it.
</p>

<p>
	Virtually no one here is going to become a master, so talking about total enlightenment is basically pointless here. It's so exceptionally rare that it is irrelevant. If someone is serious about becoming a master, they ain't on this forum, they are in a cave or forest meditating full time and they don't need any outside guidance. They understand how to do the work.

Precisely because I have other perspectives to consider and I saw problems with some of his methodology, including the dismissal of insight and intellectual integration of trips. I was also not interested in energetically overloading myself. I asked him about the possibility of energetic overload in an email a long time ago. He said it wasn't a problem at all. And I decided for myself that I don't believe that. It is a legit problem from my POV. And I take that into account whenever I trip and with how I suggest others trips. Because it's pretty obvious to me that disregarding energetic overload can be dangerous and reckless for other people if not for oneself. Which is why I developed the plugging method.
</p>

<p>
	I don't blindly follow people, I learn from them and adapt it to suit myself. I recommend you do the same, otherwise you might end up following someone off a cliff.

<title>Dissecting The Psychedelic Experience</title>

</p>

<p>
	I can remember some of my earliest trips as though they happened yesterday. The memories can be very vivid and even emotional, inspiring, and awakening.
</p>

<p>
	When I go over some of my deepest trips in my memory, it actually shifts my consciousness up a few notches in the now.
</p>

<p>
	Insights are also not just a matter of memory. Deep insights change your whole worldview and recontextualize life.
</p>

<p>
	I can never just forget that I am God. That understanding is with me no matter how bad I might feel.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like school. You don't need to remember all the details and facts in order for school to have significantly shaped your life. The trips reshape you even if you can't fully recall them.
</p>

<title>Martin Ball can’t sleep anymore</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/35998-martin-ball-can%E2%80%99t-sleep-anymore/?do=findComment&amp;comment=444939</link>

<p>
	I have never claimed that 5-MeO will clear you of all defilements or produce mastery. My claim was much more humble: that it produces genuine and very deep awakening experiences which are helpful and healing.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to purify all defilements that will obviously require far more work and it is not likely to happen through psychedelic use alone, although psychedelics ARE very effective at curing certain defilements. But probably not all of them.
</p>

<p>
	To cure all defilements would require lots of daily, near minute to minute practice. It could not be a peak experience. There is value to peak experiences as well as more gradual and mundane daily work.
</p>

<p>
	All of this was quite clear from day one. I don't know why anyone would assume that 5-MeO would do all that work for you. That was never it's purpose. It is not a replacement for inner work, it is a catalyst. Which I have said from my first videos on psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with setting the wrong expectations.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not the same as moral perfection or being Christ-like. Awakening is literally just this: becoming conscious of the true nature of ultimate reality. It is not behavioral reform. If you still crave smoking, that's a separate issue.
</p>

<p>
	Many of you guys are talking about mastery, which is something that will take you a lifetime of work.
</p>

<p>
	It is foolish to equate enlightenment with mastery. And no one has ever said that Martin had mastery. This was quite obvious.
</p>

<p>
	Buddhist maps are also poor at taking into account psychedelics. The psychedelic path requires drawing new maps. Actually what psychedics reveal is the inadequecy and partiality of Buddhist maps. The Ten Ox Herding Pics do not work well for psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	That was on an early highest dosed snorted trip: 30mg. It was truamatic and felt unhealthy so I dialed my doses back a lot and invented the plugging method, which is much smoother.
</p>

<p>
	I have not felt unhealthy energetic overload from plugging about 30 moderate doses. The trips were still very strong, but smooth and healthy feeling.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It doesn't necessarily gain any ability. Any siddhis gained are an independent factor.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening alone does not clear up all energetic issues, or shadow, or ego, or emotional issues, or bad habits. Nor is it development. So there are many factors herw besides awakening.
</p>

<p>
	All of this I have stressed in the past.
</p>

<p>
	Many awakened teachers have weird personality flaws and shadow issues and pathologies.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening does not mean there cannot be a pathology. As history shows.

</p>

<p>
	The rules must be very different for all 3.
</p>

<p>
	Gigantic biz needs the most oversight because of how much damage they can do if allowed to roam free.

<p>
	To be clear, Martin's method of using 5-MeO is very different from mine.
</p>

<p>
	I don't endorse blasting oneself with 5-MeO to the point of energetic overload as that can be needlessly traumatic.
</p>

<p>
	Moderate dosing is important in my book.
</p>

Not as many as you mention above.
</p>

<p>
	Then he started being a shaman. Which is what he describes in that vid above. And yeah, I stand corrected, seems like he did a lot of it at that point as part of his shaman gig.
</p>

<p>
	So he did much more than me then in total.
</p>

<p>
	I did not realize he was smoking it in every shaman session.
</p>

<p>
	Also, taking on other people's bad energy could be very problematic if that's what his shamanism involved.

<p>
	It costs the IRS zero to know your income. You report it to them! If you report over $200k, no UBI for you the next year. If your income drops below $200k/yr a few years later, then you start getting it again. So you always have a safety net but you don't need to use it when you are kicking ass.
</p>

<p>
	The actual dollar limits aren't so important. Those can be tweaked to find a good sweet spot.
</p>

<p>
	Very profitable corporations like Apple, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Walmart should be taxed significantly more. They are getting away with robbery.
</p>

<p>
	Small biz should be taxed less. Anything under $1M should have low tax so more people are starting small businesses. In fact there should be government rewards for starting a small biz.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that people do not need more than a few mil to live extremely well. Anything beyond that is actually unhealthy for society and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different ways to do psychedelics. They don't have to burn out anything. There are gentle ways of doing them.
</p>

<p>
	And to say that psychedelics only give insights is just false and shows a lack of experience with using them.
</p>

<p>
	Martin did not even do a lot of 5-MeO. I've done more trips than him at this point.
</p>

<p>
	I was watching an interview with a guy who did 600 DMT trips. Now that's a lot of trips.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do a fair comparison, let's bring up all the cases of people who became depressed, suicidal, had insomnia, or got attacked by demons from intense meditation or yoga. 1000s of such cases are easily found.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual work is messy, period. Do not single out psychedelics here as if all other paths are a cake walk and free of problems.
</p>

<p>
	We just don't know what is going on with Martin. We need to wait and see how things go for him.
</p>

<p>
	If Martin finally concludes that psychedelics caused his insomnia, then that will be an importnat point to acknowledge and take into account. Although even in that case, it's still just one case.
</p>

<p>
	How do you pay for UBI? Easy:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Wealth tax on people with net worth over $10M
	</li>
	<li>
		Raise taxes on people with income over $1M/year
	</li>
	<li>
		Raise capital gains tax
	</li>
	<li>
		Raise taxes on passive income
	</li>
	<li>
		Wall Street tax
	</li>
	<li>
		Real estate speculation tax
	</li>
	<li>
		Much higher taxes on real estate that is a 2nd or 3rd home.
	</li>
	<li>
		Raise taxes on corporations with cash reserves over $1 billion
	</li>
	<li>
		High taxes on yatchs and private jets and luxury cars
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	No VAT, and people who earn over $200k/yr do not get a UBI at all since they don't need it.

	It might happen. We'll see. But don't get attached to it happening, as that just creates more suffering.

		<p>
			Thank you for the nice responses.
		</p>

		<p>
			Leo, when are you going to invite us to your seminar? Are we going to meet you this year? Have you decided to postpone with seminars?
		</p>

		<p>
			I am so depressed lately, I do not see any reason to keep going. The more I think about the possibility of being infinite, the more depressed I become.  I wish from all my heart I meet you and other people who follow this pursuit. Sometimes, it is unbearable and feels so lonely. Would be nice to attain your convention for some "fresh air" and positive energy and offset. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I understand that my mental state is temporary, but I wish I can get out of it as soon as I can. What book would you recommend to read or what practices should I do? I want to be happy again. I used to be happy when did something meaningful or hobby, now nothing excites me anymore, even traveling.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thank you so much, 
		</p>

		<p>
			Lots of hugs.
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Unfortunately happiness cannot be attained as an external condition or even an internal condition. Happiness is simply accepting whatever arises, however it is, no matter how "bad" it is.
</p>

<p>
	Meeting me will not really make you happy. I wish it were that easy.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than trying to get out of your mental state the counter-intuitive move is to just accept it, make peace with it. And that is what ends up making it okay.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, you can also act your way out of a funk. Like going outside for a jog or listening to some music. But that is not a permanent solution.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes this work is just fucking hard.
</p>

<p>
	* hug *
</p>

</p>

<p>
	This is significant, but also keep in mind that this is just one case study, and people can be very different, especially when it comes to health issues.
</p>

<p>
	Awakened people can have health complications and even mental issues or energetic issues or shadow. Do not expect them to be impervious to stress, and under enough stress even an awakened person should be expected to crack at some point.
</p>

<p>
	Again, a lot of this confusion is caused by having overly simplistic and binary notions of awakening/liberation, where you guys think that it's total and there is zero suffering and you are a Terminator. That's a very cartoonish understanding of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	It is not clear what the cause of Martin's issues are. So don't jump to hasty conclusions.
</p>

<p>
	Let's monitor his case and see how things turn out for him and what larger lessons his situation holds, if any.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like this might be part of his spiritual path. This might be his way of purifying himself even further to reach deeper levels of self-mastery. Or it could be some rare health condition. It's hard to say.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you are not conscious then no amount of words can help you. But by chasing consciousness you cut yourself off from the very perfection which you are seeking.
</p>

<p>
	It's the classic paradox of spiritual seeking.
</p>

<p>
	How do you walk a path which has zero steps? And yet you would be a fool not to walk it.
</p>

<p>
	So in practice we must do some kind of practices.

</p>

<p>
	You guys are in no position to talk about Coral.

	Focus instead on mastering the lower stages. Most of you still do not understand what Yellow and Turquoise are, let alone some hypothetical Coral.

<p>
	And that too is perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Perfection doesn't actually come from perfect embodiment but from realizing that perfection is always the case no matter how you feel or what you do. This radical level of self-love is the cure to all problems because it does not need to cure anything, it just accepts it.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive to how the ego imagines perfection. The ego's version of perfection is actually hell because it imagines a state in the future where all conditions will be favorable to it. And this will never come, causing great suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Perfection is an Absolute. It is NOW! NOW! NOW! It is EVERYTHING!
</p>

<p>
	But politics is a relative affair.

Yang will reduce welfare programs to fund his UBI, then when the Republicans come back into power years later they will just end the UBI and the welfare programs would already be crippled. Thus creating big step back.
</p>

<p>
	One of the key problems with UBI is that it's so easy to end it. What's necessary is to build deep-rooted infrastructure and systems which cannot be cut easily in the future, like Medicare and Social Security.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately the UBI has no infrastructure behind it, making it weak to cutting.

	Trading stocks is a bad idea overall because you are not actually generating any value for the world. So the likelihood of failure is enormous.

<p>
	Make yourself valuable. Become a massive value provider if you wish to break free of wage slavery.

<p>
	Everything changes 360 degrees, leaving you right where you began. But with a higher understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is the same, but nothing is quite the same.

<p>
	After enlightenment, the laundry.

But the higher the stage the more consistent it tends to be.
</p>

<p>
	It varies a lot from person to person.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Orange can have high integrity. Howard Stern might be a good example.

</p>

<p>
	Guys, watch the dualistic framing of your questions very carefully.
</p>

<p>
	Sloppy framing leads to poor understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Just by framing your question as me vs you, that's already wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Me = you
</p>

<p>
	By distinguishing me from you, you create my ego and your ego simultaneously. Self/other is the very first duality.

Anti-capitalism is a trap. There needs to be an intelligent synthesis of capitalism and socialism. Which is really already the case. We do not live in a purely capitalist system and we never have.

	You are the final authority as to what is "real" since you are God.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you imagine to be real will appear real to you. And there is nothing outside you.

<p>
	I cannot tell you because I am just a fragment of your own mind. You must realize this and take back your authority rather than projecting it on me.

		</p>

		<p>
			1) You don't exist, you're just imagination. you are MySelf(capital S) pretending to be real when you are not. I am making you up now, for my own entertainment. But if I look close at you and actualized.org, you're no less mechanical, and no more real than a non playable character in elder scrolls.
		</p>

			2) I don't exist, I'm just your imagination. I am YourSelf(capital S) pretending to be real when I am not. You are making me up now, for your own entertainment. But if you look close at me, I'm no less mechanical, and no more real than a non playable character in elder scrolls.
		</p>

		<p>
			If the answer is both why can't I experience your perspective right now? Why can't I teleport my soul into your body right now, see the couch you're sitting on, see the camera you use to make actualized.org videos right now? In my empirical experience, you don't exist at all. Yet I cannot tell you you don't exist, because you can say the same about me? In my experience I am the only one who exists right now and all of you are just non playable characters. But you can say the exact same about me???? Who is right here?
		</p>

		<p>
			If I am just a perspective, and you reached total omnipresence, you should be able to experience right now my perspective(if both of us are just endoscopes) you should be able to switch between endoscopes.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my experience, there's just 1 endoscope, which is me, and all the other endoscopes aren't real.

<p>
	Both of course!
</p>

<p>
	You ARE experiencing my perspective! That just means you are living my life and have zero knowledge of ever having been you. Which is literally what I am. I am just you minus all your memories and experiences, plus all of my memories and experiences.
</p>

<p>
	My life is your life. Your life is my life. When you become me, you become fully me! Which means no more old you.
</p>

<p>
	God is an infinite multi-parallel processing hallucination. It has no limits.

</p>

<p>
	Which is why Trump is such a terrible leader. He does not even know the meaning of that word.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie has amazing integrity. High integrity comes with consciousness. So as our society becomes better as elevating the consciousness of all citizens, we will have more high-integrity leaders (and followers).

			Great video, lot of deep stuff.
		</p>

		<p>
			The only thing I'd add is to what you said is that from my experience there comes a time in which there is no going in to find a god head (or out), there is nothing that is not god/head, the experience of those phenomenon (going in or out) and the differences that are experienced as such, visible and known (the appearance of differences, spiritual experience vs mundane everyday, more conscious vs less conscious, what is known as god vs what is just its forms and not god) are itself god/head....
		</p>

		<p>
			Another thing that I found is God tricking itself is not a negative (it may not be a trick), its not a problem, its not something to see as wrong that has happened, that "people" are deliberately" deluding themselves.  There are no people, but god happening as it wants to, living the human experience, the dog experience, the alien experience and in my opinion is to be celebrated, met with heart and love of myself.

<p>
	Of course trickery is not a negative. It is Creation! It's beautiful.

<p>
	The whole process of awakening is full of suffering because the ego has to processes all of its own bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	But this a purification process. So it's positive in the long-run.
</p>

<p>
	No pain no gain. The devil will not leave your body peacefully or quietly. There will be moments of great self-doubt and self-loathing.

<title>Presidential candidate Andrew Yang</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/35961-presidential-candidate-andrew-yang/?do=findComment&amp;comment=443979</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I am well aware of Yang.
</p>

<p>
	I watched many of his interviews and speeches.
</p>

<p>
	He is definitely very authentic, smart, and in some ways visionary.
</p>

<p>
	But I have some serious problems with his proposals:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		He uses UBI as a universal solution to too many issues. UBI is good but it cannot solve all the problems he proposes.
	</li>
	<li>
		He wants to fund UBI through VAT taxes, which is a bad idea in my opinion because it is a tax on the poor not the rich.
	</li>
	<li>
		His UBI also goes to rich people who don't need it at all and it counts against other government benefits like social security and food stamps.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is against free college for all.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is against Medicare For All.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is against $15 minimum wage.
	</li>
	<li>
		He seems to hold some libertarian notions.
	</li>
	<li>
		He does not directly question the structural problems of capitalism itself.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Yang is good, but Bernie is better. If Bernie proposed a UBI, Yang would basically have nothing left to stand on. I think Bernie should propose a UBI in addition to everything else he stands for.
</p>

<p>
	I give Yang lots of credit for proposing UBI in the first place, and for talking about job automation.
</p>

<p>
	The final problem is: he simply doesn't poll well. I don't think he has a serious chance of winning the primary. Of course that could change, but Bernie has much better odds in my estimation.
</p>

<p>
	But in the end if Yang wins, I would be happy too.
</p>

<p>
	I have warned you guys so many times about self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	Go back and re-watch my self-deception 3 part series. It's very important and you still don't appreciate how serious this problem is.
</p>

<p>
	This work is devilishly tricky.
</p>

<p>
	No, you cannot use concepts or science if you wish to understand the deepest levels of what reality is. There is no reason why you should feel entitled to that.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, I use concepts all the time to teach, but the difference is, I understand their limitation whereas you do not.

<p>
	Illusion IS reality.
</p>

<p>
	So if you think you have a past, you literally do! However you hold reality is what becomes real for you. Since you are God.
</p>

<p>
	What people don't generally understand is the constructive nature of the mind. Reality is not a given. It is constructed by you. People do not like to take responsibility for being The Creator. It is a radical degree of responsibility.
