<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Look at your paranoia.
</p>

<p>
	If Bill Gates wanted to be a power-hungry psychopath, he could easily do so given his resources, and his work and influence would look very different. He could easily be a tyrant or a James Bond villian.
</p>

<p>
	But here is a guy who devoted the remainder of his life to helping mankind, and you call him a psychopath. That's like spitting in God's face.
</p>

<p>
	You can question the capitalist political system which under-taxes billionaires, but when a billionaire acts for the benefit of powerless people, don't bite his hand. People are not bad for being billionaires. It's how they use their money and power after they get it that matters.
</p>

<p>
	Bill Gates warned about coronavirus some years ago. While you were at home watching Netflix and jerking off, he was working hard to make sure your mom doesn't die of a pandemic. Yet he is the psychopath. Lol

			This sounds all nice and good but isnt this just basic nonduality 101? I mean everything is an illusion is not a new teaching, it's pretty basic stuff. It's as old as spirituality. I doubt budhha was not aware of this.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also I have a question, why are you not aware of the things that these great masters talk about like other realms, angels, demons, disembodied beings, celestial beings, different universes, different dimensions, past lives etc many more things that they speak of like 84th universe. Why are you not become aware of any of these things in your trips?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	First of all, I have become aware of some of those things and so do others when they trip.
</p>

<p>
	But more importantly, all of those things are still imaginary (since all form is imaginary).
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Consciousness is higher than all those things.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality has many degrees to it. It all sounds the same but one's consciousness of it can go deeper and deeper.

<p>
	If this was true, you'd be a slave right now living under a tyranical king. Or even more likely you'd be dead.
</p>

<p>
	Equality comes in many, many degrees. 10,000 years of human history is nothing but a record of the successes of equality over inequality. See the big picture. Evolution moves towards greater unity and love.

	This is very counter-intuitive but by trying to make people good you create evil.

	Real goodness is not something you make. Real goodness is the surrender to whatever is. Whatever is, is Good. Not realizing this is the cause of all suffering.

<p>
	If you are practicing martial arts by yourself that's different.

	Contemplate this: why would you even be interested in learning to fight another human being? What are you insecure about? Where are you lacking self-love?

<p>
	Of course she will resist it. It would be a huge blow to her ego.
</p>

<p>
	That's why I said, "get her to contemplate". She has to want to think through this topic rather than acting out an ideology. This requires an open mind and genuine desire for a deeper understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Since she's in stage Blue/Orange, what she needs is all the stuff required to advance to Green. See my SD videos for tips on how to advance from Orange to Green. It will take her about 5 years, assuming she is serious about growth. Which it sounds like she isn't, in which case, never.
</p>

<p>
	Open her mind to the idea of growth.

<p>
	God has "killed" itself when you were born. That's what you are: God not realizing it is God. Your human birth was God's termination of itself.
</p>

<p>
	But this is only an imaginary termination of course. God cannot actually end itself because it is endless and exists in all places, so it has no place to go. Death/termination/birth is imagined by God. So God is prior to it.
</p>

<p>
	Death is purely imaginary. Like in a video game. Can Mario ever die? How many lives does Mario have?

<p>
	Precisely because if it wasn't you would go insane and there would be no "reality".
</p>

<p>
	A good story needs consistency.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to deconstruct because if you deconstruct it you'd be fucking dead. This isn't a game. Your whole life hinges on your memory. Even an "enlightened master" needs to remember his address.

<p>
	Flinging shit is also love and beautiful.
</p>

<p>
	But a conscious being has better things to do than fling shit.
</p>

<p>
	MMA is barbaric. And in a few hundred years people will look back at it and gasp at the barbarism the way we do today with slavery or rape.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't deny its artistry. You can turn rape into an artform. But a conscious person wouldn't.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a civilization that had rape on pay per view and each rape victim earned ten million dollars per rape.

<p>
	You would never do MMA if you reached a higher level of consciousness.

	I have an automated system that backs up all my computers daily to a local 40TB NAS storage unit which has a raid array.
</p>

<p>
	You can buy small automated external drives which connect to your local network. Do some research. It's pretty easy to set up these days.
</p>

<p>
	Or if you are cheap and lazy, cloud.

<title>Does the upper class benefit from socialized programs?</title>

<p>
	All this misses the point. The real point is to get your mother to contemplate what it would be like if she reincarnated and lived life as every member of society. So in the next life she will not be a successful business person but a poor immigrant with bad genetics, bad childhood, and a chronic disease.
</p>

<p>
	Your mother's business success is not merely a function of hard work. That success is built on a foundation which your mother is not in control of: genetics, place of birth, parents, good health, favorable economic system, etc. She takes all that for granted by assuming that all people in society are like her. Well, they aren't. Not even close. Imagine if her child had an incurable lifelong disease which forced her into bankrupcy and homelessness.
</p>

<p>
	That's exactly right, she is denying responsibility for being a member of society. It's to say that others aren't working hard enough when work comes easily to you and you benefit in a thousand other ways. Her success is the result of society. It is not her own.
</p>

You ain't ever gonna find a "thing" behind the eyes. All you will find is degrees of emptiness. And emptiness is not behind the eyes, it is equally in all places, since it is nowhere.

It depends a lot on you. It's a good idea to be open to exploring various methods to find those which resonate with you. Allow this to be a process of discovery and experimentation, that way you can stumble upon new stuff, new methods, new teachers, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will give you some solid glimpses but they will not be enough by themselves to embody awakening. You will need some manual practices. Developing your concentration ability is crucial. It think this holds people back the most. They can't focus the mind long enough to awaken.

</p>

<p>
	The point of meditation, contemplation, yoga, self-inquiry is to develop very strong concentration ability which is necessary to break through.
</p>

<p>
	Concentration is the key. It changes your state of consciousness when done rigorously and for long periods of time. Psychedelics make concentration much easier. Otherwise you gonna have to train your ass off manually.
</p>

<p>
	Questioning beliefs is good, but it won't be enough by itself. Your state of consciousness has to change.

<p>
	No, all imagination and division comes to an end sooner or later and ends in Oneness/Truth. Dreams are always temporary.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not imagined. The dream is imagined. Awakening is beyond that.

</p>

<p>
	You are not going to be meditative all day long while doing everyday tasks without decades of serious training.
</p>

<p>
	Either limit your meditation to short but rigorous daily sessions, or do a full 10 day retreat. Otherwise you will be half-assing it and get nowhere. Effective meditation requires rigor.

	Hypnosis is real and it can be powerful when done by a master.

<p>
	As far as videos go, of course those can be fake or exaggerted to gain views. As always, the more popular a thing is, the more dumb it tends to be.

	He spent decades building up to that point.

<p>
	Lower your dose to 2g and CONTEMPLATE! It's not about quantity, it's about how you use it.

	You're not a person at all. You are God/Love/Consciousness/Everything which has confused itself for a person.

<p>
	It is okay to be however you are and it is okay to make mistakes in life. Don't be so hard on yourself.

<p>
	You are overlooking how relative this is.
</p>

<p>
	There is far more racism and opression in less developed countries. A country doesn't need to be perfect to be developed. If you think the racism in the US is bad, you're overlooking how bad it is elsewhere.

<p>
	Democracies are not dissolving, they are getting stronger via temporary struggle. The US is more democratic now than its ever been.

<p>
	It can, assuming you are willing. But if you are stubborn, then that is your karma and you are stuck until such time that you surrender your stubbornness.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, karma is nothing other than your unwillingness to surrender.

	You must dive deep into whatever color stage you are still struggling with.
</p>

<p>
	You can't be solid Green until you exhaust Orange. Become so Orange that you get sick of it. Then you will be truely ready for Green.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, that's what Elliot Hulse is doing. He's playing through Blue and Orange. Burning through his karma to someday reach Green. If he ever reaches Green in this lifetime he'll see how silly and dysfunctional his rants about sluts and sexual purity were. But he needs to go through these rants to purify himself. So what you're seeing in his videos is his growing up process.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is that he is dragging his followers along with him into the dysfunction. But he can't help it. So here we are.

	Seems like you are still resisting and have surrender and integration work to do.
</p>

<p>
	You can just lower your doses and keep integrating each trip until you stop being scared of them.

<p>
	Progressive change has always required years and lots of pressure. People in power do not just give up their power willingly.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind, just because you want society to be progressive does not mean everyone else does too. In a democracy, many people are moderate or conservative. That means they vote for someone like Joe Biden. Bernie didn't have a money problem. His message was clear. It's just that he was too progressive for average folks. Bernie didn't lose because some evil elites held him back. Bernie lost because most voters are not progressive and don't want such fundamental change.
</p>

<p>
	In a democracy sometimes you have to accept defeat.
</p>

<p>
	If you are very progressive, chances are society will never be as progrssive as you want, because you are ahead of your time. This is not because of evil elites, it's because average people are not ready to make the sacrifices that progressivism requires.

<p>
	I don't say that I'm the most conscious.

<p>
	All I claim is that I have accessed peak states of consciousness which are super-human and which very few people have ever accessed or could access naturally.

<p>
	Sadhguru does not understand psychedelics, so his opinions on them are irrelevant to me.

<p>
	Depends on how you define "level of consciousness." Generally speaking your state will drop back to what it was before the trip. But you will remain insights, memories, and it will leave a mark on your psyche. But you will not keep the higher state as that requires neurotransmitters which you lack.

<p>
	Well, every state is God, so here it is. But this current state is nothing like the God-mode state of 5-MeO-DMT. I'm not in God-mode, I'm more in human mode.

<p>
	I can be if I train my mind on it.
</p>

<p>
	But most of the time I operate as if others are real. It's not useful to metaphysically question people all the time. It's an illusion that I play within. Sort of like when you play a video game, you're not constantly question that it's all just a game. You buy into the illusion and act as if it is real, at least for a while.

<p>
	It can in certain ways. Mostly I notice less fear about needing to please others. So I act more authentically and I feel less of a need to play social games. I think awakening makes one more direct and authentic with people.

<p>
	I've noticed that I care less and less what people think about me, which frees me up to act however I would naturally act if I was alone. Yes, less shyness, less fear, less distance with strangers. More compassion for their personal suffering.

<p>
	It does, but that doesn't mean your ego-mind will like it.
</p>

<p>
	The more Truth and Love, the more terrified you will get. Because it's not there to please or suit your personal survival needs. The deeper you go, the more of your life you'll have to surrender. How much are you willing to surrender? How selfless are you willing to be? This is very challenging for a human.
</p>

<p>
	It's much more challenging than people expect. Because you can't imagine how much illusion there is to surrender.

<p>
	I was just making a point.
</p>

<p>
	I don't recommend working 14 hrs a day. But if you aren't using your time productively, in a healthy way, you will probably start using it towards devilry of some kind.

<p>
	Productive use of time doesn't have to mean only work. It could also include family, friends, hobbies, fitness, cooking, hiking, reading, meditation, etc.

<p>
	Other people are an illusion. If you shake that illusion, life becomes very dull. Just you by yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The illusion is very hard to entirely break. For practical purposes we continue treating people as if they are real because that's what survival dictates and our minds aren't interested in truth, they are interested in illusions.

Imagination has many layers to it and your present state of consciousness does not give you access to the deepest layers. Those layers which you don't have access to you call "physical reality". As you gain more access "physical reality" will start to become more and more fluid, less solid, less "real".

<p>
	Of course! We are talking about what makes for a healthy society. Which is always a moving target and it depends on your survival goals.
</p>

<p>
	No two people will have the same vision of a healthy society. Which is what makes politics so challenging. How do you get 300 million people to agree on what "healthy society" means? And yet it must be done if we are to thrive.

<title>Did anyone figure out a way to stop demonizing people?</title>

<p>
	I have two basic techniques:
</p>

<p>
	1) Be so busy working on your life purpose that you don't have time to criticize others. Focus on being constructive rather than destructive. If you were working 14hrs per day on your art you wouldn't have the time or energy to criticize anyone.
</p>

<p>
	Critics are usually people who have nothing else to do. They aren't using their time productively. They aren't wise enough to channel their energy creativity.
</p>

<p>
	2) Awaken to Love. Realize that you are all people. Then it becomes impossible to criticize or judge others because you are conscious that their mistakes are your mistakes. If you were conscious that you are Hitler or Jeffery Epstein, how could you judge him?
</p>

<p>
	Judgment is only possible when there is still the illusion of "other" in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	One's political position on this graph shouldn't be a fixed thing. It should be a dynamic balancing act in response to one's current political climate.
</p>

<p>
	Today, in America, it makes sense to be in the green quadrant given the current imbalances in our society. But 50 years from now, or in a different part of the world, it might make sense to shift to another quadrant in response. Because what's most important is proper balance, not a fixed position. Which is why ideology is such a problem. Ideology acts as if one quadrant is absolutely the best, which then leads to imbalance.
</p>

<p>
	If you think right is always the best, you will fall into imbalance. If you think left is always the best, you will fall into imbalance. Life is far too complex for such simplistic attitudes. The only reason the left seems like the best today is because things has been skewed so far right in recent times. It won't always be this way. The whole key is to have such a flexible mind that you're able to move your position to what works best in the current situation.
</p>

			You visualize so intensely, that it actually becomes a reality and you literally feel the energy in your spine. At this point, we would be at Actuality, right?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes!
</p>

<p>
	You are literally imagining the new reality you want. Basic LoA.
</p>

<p>
	You are using the power of imagination to drill a portal to God. Many spiritual techniques rely on this mechanism without being explicit about it. That's how prayer works, for example. If you pray long and hard enough to Jesus, he can manifest himself to you. Because in fact Jesus is just a facet of your own mind. This is why some people worship Jesus, and it works for them. Other people worship an elephant man, and it works for them. Other people worship the devil, and it works for them. You can even worship Leo and one day I will appear to you and guide you to God. It doesn't matter what specific form your worship.
</p>

<p>
	This is why an infinite number of different religions can exist. The details of the imagery are largely irrelevant, as long as you take it seriously.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is to blur the materialist boundary between "real" vs imaginary. This boundary itself is imaginary! The more you can blur this boundary, the more powerful you can be at manifesting and manipulating reality. This how yogis develop supernatural abilities/siddhis. They train up their imagination skills.
</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			”These considerations point to a telos for the topology of the membrane: if the entire membrane could fold in on itself to form one single loop encompassing all of mind – a kind of cosmic sphere of mind – there would be no trade-off. Self-reflectiveness would be all-encompassing, in the sense that all vibrations of mind – all mental contents – would fall within the field of self-reflection. There would be no ‘unconscious.’ Moreover, there would be no illusion of separation either: this one loop of mind would identify itself with all good and all evil, all bliss and all suffering, all polarities and perspectives. The full nature of mind would unavoidably penetrate the field of its own self-reflective contemplation.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, this would be a state of Total Omniscience or Infinite Consciousness. I've been in this state. This is God's purest, highest state. In this state, God is an infinite singularity which is completely self-aware and self-understanding. Nothing is hidden from its awareness. It is just pure Consciousness, pure Love.

			Why doesn’t the membrane of mind simply use its freewill to form this single global loop at once? Why hasn’t it happened yet? Why all the struggles? The answer here is rather simple: for mind at large to know that it should shape itself as a single loop it would already have to have the global self-reflectiveness that only a single loop could provide.”
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It has happened already! The mistake is assuming that Infinite Mind is limited by past or future. Past and future are things which Infinite Mind imagines, so it is not limited by them.
</p>

<p>
	God does not need to wait for some future state in order to become fully God. God is always fully God. But temporarily it can forget that it is God as it explores finite parts of itself. If God wants to know what it's like to be a kangaroo, it has to stop being omniscient for a while and pretend to be a kangaroo. During this brief period, past and future arise. Otherwise there is no past or future for God.

<p>
	Love, Will, Omniscience, Omnipotence, Intelligence, Benevolence, Creativity, etc. are all inherent to Infinity/Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The highest Will simply chooses the highest Love, which then necessitates the entire Universe exactly as it is. Because God IS Will, God IS Love. It doesn't "do" Love, it IS Love and all of its free Will goes into being Love. You can say God chooses to be Love, or you can say God has no choice but to be Love because God IS Love. Both are the same.
</p>

<p>
	There isn't a "how". God is Love. No "how" necessary. It is direct. Or, you could say it does so via Infinite Consciousness/Intelligence/Will.
</p>

<p>
	If you were infinitely conscious/intelligent, you would have no other wish but to express Love. So then your Will and your Love would be the same thing.

	<li>
		Public ownership of all businesses
	</li>
	<li>
		Totally open borders
	</li>
	<li>
		Abolishing the military
	</li>
	<li>
		Confiscating money from rich people
	</li>
	<li>
		Overthrowing the government
	</li>
	<li>
		Anarchism (some lefties are anarchists)
	</li>
	<li>
		Authoritarian communism like in China
	</li>
	<li>
		Antifa style violent protest
	</li>
	<li>
		Mandatory college education
	</li>
	<li>
		Forcing people to use weird gender pronouns and other silly PC labels
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.

	But these are such radical things no serious left-wing politician is pushing for them and they would never pass.

<p>
	Ego is God imagining it is not God but a human.

<p>
	God is free to imagine itself to be anything: a rock, a tree, a coffee table, a kangaroo, a man, a woman, an alien, or... it can be aware that it is God.
</p>

<p>
	It's like when you play a video game so hard you forget you are a human. Well, God is playing your life so hard right now that it forgot it is God. As soon as you remember, that will be Awakening.

<p>
	It is possible, but not realistic. And your level of realization, even if it does happen, will be very low.

You just realize that your body is already God. God is exactly what you see now, minus the ego.
</p>

<p>
	A change in your state of consciousness is required. This is accomplished with spiritual practices like self-inquiry, meditation, psychedelics, yoga, etc. The practices must be done rigorously.

<p>
	Careful. Do not fall into the trap of demonizing or over-simplifying the right wing.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so simple at all. Not all right wingers are buffoons like on Fox News.

It's just a neat concept which you can appreciate if you do psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Reality isn't really a strange loop, it is Infinity. But when you try to think causually about Infinity you will run into strange loops. Strange loops are the result of a finite mind trying to grasp Infinity.

			This is perfect example of why the very idea of good, progress, evolution, betterment of society is a wrong kind of direction in your spiritual life. Desire to better society is the source of many evil, deaths and suffering. I think the authentic spiritual orientation must be fighting society, not improving it. Perhaps people who wanted to better society - have invented covid. And if not people, then let's say reality has invented covid in order to better society. Then the very desire to improve society is wrong and lead to bad outcomes. Think about it, what good society does for person, society only brainwashes person. So I guess its here not for us to improve it but for us to oppose it. If you improve it - you are helping it to increase its brainwashing power. Re-think your big picture.

	This is delusional.

<p>
	It takes a massive ego to think you know better the course of mankind than society.
