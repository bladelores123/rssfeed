			Levels of spiritual development is just a story. It's part of the game. Degrees of enlightenment is really interesting for the ego. The ultimate specialness. You project the need for specialness onto the "teachers," and see them as all knowing Gods amongst men. Separation at its finest form, tricky trap.

<p>
	Except there are many different levels of consciousness. There is an extraordinary range. Has nothing to do with specialness.

		<p>
			Even then it is a guess.

<p>
	Even that is tricky because people understand love in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	But I generally agree that Love is a very distinctive level of awakening which many lack.

	The US Airforce and Navy captured it and released the video.

<p>
	What more do you want?
</p>

<p>
	If there are bodies or vehicles, there is no fucking way any military government will give those up for public display in some museum. This would be the most valuable technology on the planet and the first priority would be to use it to gain advantage over other governments. All that will surely be kept top level classified.
</p>

<p>
	It's also reasonable that advanced aliens would not likely crashland on Earth. They probably know how to fly real well.
</p>

<p>
	It makes a lot of sense to me that aliens would fly around and observe us from a distance without meddling in our politics because that is a lost cause.

<p>
	There is a point in becoming more conscious as it improves life.
</p>

<p>
	Also, just because death happens to the body does not automatically mean you stay in Infinite Love forever. You may still not be ready for that and reincarnate as a Nazi or something.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Love is the ulitmate destination, but how long it takes you to get there is up to you. Maybe you'll need 100 lifetimes.

	What if this alien has bacteria and viruses? The US government would arrest him and probably kill him to see his innards. How stupid would the alien have to be to travel a thousand light years just to land on the White House lawn and have to deal with Trump and his alt-right asshats?

<p>
	What I have seen is this:
</p>

<p>
	When your consciousness goes fully infinite, even the notion of eating cake or experiencing life becomes extraneous. If you were infinitely conscious you would be so complete and full, so not lacking in anything, that life itself would become obsolete and come to an end. You would simply exist as pure Infinite Love forever.
</p>

<p>
	If you are still here eating cake, you're not complete. Your love is indirect.
</p>

<p>
	Just to experience life is already an act of seperation and bias. And with it must come lack, because your highest form is pure formless Love. Until you are an absolute Unity, you are lacking something. When you are an absolute Unity, there is need for celebration or enjoyment of even life. You are too united for such games. They are all indirect. Life itself is indirect.
</p>

<p>
	Life is for kids who are too scared of Infinite Love forever.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is speculating about the levels of consciousnes of people you don't really know.
</p>

<p>
	The correct answer is: you are just guessing. And that's a dangerous game to play as you could easily be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	So be careful. You could really get screwed up that way by assuming too much. You are not in a good position to judge anyone's level of realization until you yourself are deeply realized. And even then it's tricky.

<title>Inevitable Fatality vs.Illusory Free Will</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Reality is nondual, so you cannot put it into simplistic human cateogries like free will vs no free will.
</p>

<p>
	There really is no difference between the two.
</p>

<p>
	Since you are God, you are in the very nexus of creation, where Will and Being merge into a seamless Unity. You are in the driver's seat, driving creation.
</p>

<p>
	Reality/God is a tautology, which means it cannot be any other way than the way it is. But it is always in the process of creation, so it will become whatever you create. Your destiny is whatever you end up creating in the now. What is meant to be is whatever you create.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you regret, the ultimate lesson is to forgive yourself and love yourself. There are probably other lessons there as well, but the highest lesson is to accept reality as it is, which in this case includes whatever bad act you committed. You can learn to do it better next time, but the fact is whatever mistakes you made in the past are whatever they are, and could not be otherwise. So accept it. But the future is open and unknown, so you are not doomed to repeat the same mistakes. You get to decide how things will unfold.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to be confused about the lesson. It might take months or years before you learn what the lesson was. The lesson may still be unfolding so maybe you don't have enough data yet to draw a solid conclusion.
</p>

<p>
	UFO sightings are so numerous that it's hard to dismiss it all as delusion or fantasy. There are simply too many credible reports.
</p>

<p>
	It's really not so outrageous that aliens fly around in space. Once you contemplate this idea for a while, you see it's quite reasonable and there are good reasons why they would not just land on the White House lawn like interstellar partycrashers. Mankind is not ready to deal with aliens. We can barely deal with immigrants without going apeshit.

<p>
	Reality is Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	No triangles or particles or numbers or shapes are fundamental.
</p>

<p>
	You will never be able to ground reality in any kind of form or object, since they are all imaginary and reality has no bottom, top, beginning, or end.
</p>

<p>
	You will never be able to understand Infinity through any kind of symbolic system like sicence or math. You must access Infinity directly via your consciousness. You are Infinity. So become infinite.
</p>

<p>
	Plato did psychedelics, so he likely had some direct consciousness of God, which informed his philosophy. It's just a question of how deep did he go? How total was his awakening? My guess is, not so total.

	His Allegory of the Cave is clearly from doing psychedelics. And its pretty accurate.
</p>

<p>
	I think Plato was on the right track, but he didn't go all the way and his work is rather outdated and murky by today's standards.

<p>
	You guys are shooting yourselves in the foot.
</p>

<p>
	Politics requires good strategy, not blind idealism.
</p>

<p>
	By calling Obama/Biden war criminals you leave the door wide open for Trump to do something like start WW3.
</p>

<p>
	It's childishly naive and you will lose because people's lives are at stake.
</p>

<p>
	Politics is not about what makes you feel good. Stop making it about you and your feelings. As if appeasing you is the point.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be voting for Mickey Mouse.
</p>

<p>
	The right is united in 2020. If the left goes divided, the right wins, which means progressives lose the most. 4 more years of Trump is not going to help your cause. Biden is a way better alternative, even though you are not passionate about him. Your passions are a luxury. You have to learn how to be pragmatic and strategic at times. Being a rabbid progressive who never compromises is not a virtue. It means you will have almost no power or voice.
</p>

<p>
	Since consciousness is infinite, it can be completely self-connected and infinitely telepathic.

	We will be cracking down on all conspiracy theories on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	Those of you who keep posting conspiracy theories here, be careful, because bans are coming.
</p>

<p>
	This is not the place for it. Take your conspiracy theories to Reddit or wherever. Here we do not engage in wild speculation and "us vs them" thinking and blaming.
</p>

<p>
	Since this Covid-19 thing started I have noticed an uptick in fear-mongering and conspiratorial thinking. This is expected, since people are scared and looking for someone to blame rather than taking responsibility for themselves. People also now have a lot more free time on their hands to go down these rabbit holes.

<p>
	But on a deeper level there is still a lack. You lack its taste which is the only reason to put cake in your mouth.
</p>

<p>
	If you could generate the taste of cake using your mind, you'd never need to eat cake. Since you lack that ability, you require cake to give you that taste.
</p>

<p>
	If you could give yourself a proper orgasm, you wouldn't need sex. You use people like pawns precisely because you need them to get what you can't otherwise get.

<p>
	If it was, that won't be good enough to embody that radical degree of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	This is why people become full-time monks. It takes a lot of work to be able to live from that place 24/7.
</p>

<p>
	One or two peak experiences will not be enough.
</p>

<p>

	If it happens, good. And if it doesn't happen, good.

<p>
	But it's easy here to fall into the trap of setting artificial spiritual rules for yourself like, "Thou shalt not fuck ever again." Or holding sexual desires as wrong or evidence of lack of spirituality.

	From what I have experienced, there are fundamental limitations to being in this body which block you from the highest consciousness.

	You can certainly transcend sex. I just bet you won't. And it's a bit silly to even desire that. I would much rather teach you how to have astounding metaphysical sex.

<title>Can you lose progress in consciousness?</title>

<p>
	Ego backlash is very common. You could consider is losing progress, or you can see it all as part of the whole path.
</p>

<p>
	Like the stock market, you can't always be in a bull market. Life waxes and wanes. There are cycles, phases, and chapters.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to see failure as crucial to your ultimate success. Failure is not a bad thing. It's how we learn our deepest lessons.
</p>

<p>
	There is an old Zen story about how an eager young monk renounced material life and spent years trying to get enlightened. But it just didn't happen for him. Finally he quit in frustration and decided to go immediately to a whorehouse and get laid. As soon as he stuck his dick in, enlightenment happened.

<p>
	If you want to stop your sex drive, there's a real simple way. Get your balls removed.
</p>

<p>
	We do it to cats and dogs every day. Works great.

<p>
	Smoke some DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Studies are shit and they won't convince you of what consciousness is capable of.
</p>

<p>
	Telepathy is so profound and shocking that your jaw will drop when it hits you over the head like a sledgehammer. You're not gonna understand it through logic or current science.
</p>

<p>
	And that will still just be the tip of the iceberg.
</p>

<p>
	Ditch science. It's shit. Do real spirituality and never look back. Let the scientists circle jerk each other by themselves. They are children. There's no real consciouness to be found in academia.

<p>
	Smoke some DMT and you will get a higher dimensional reality.
</p>

<p>
	I have accessed realities beyond our universe. Things which the human mind cannot imagine or even store in memory.
</p>

<p>
	But don't expect to be able to hold that beyond a peak experience.
</p>

<p>
	The human form seems to have fundamental limits, just like how a kangaroo can't do calculus.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is beyond experiencing new realities. Awakening is far more profound and radical than that. It cuts through all realities, all dimensions.

<p>
	Good, but that's now become a memory. A memory of Love is better than not, but what really matters is your current state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Now you need to be conscious that THIS, HERE, NOW is Love.
</p>

<p>
	Memories are good for starters, but even them you will have to transcend to live fully from NOW.

<p>
	It can.

<p>
	Right. So what you are noticing is that state is crucial. Certain things can only be understood from certain states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why cultivating states is so important in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Your state sets a glass ceiling for what you can understand and even recall.
</p>

<p>
	And yet at the same time it's important not to get trapped in chasing states.
</p>

<p>
	Technically speaking, understanding is always happening in the realm of form, so it is always limited and it cannot be permanent. All understanding is gained and so must be lost.
</p>

<p>
	Basically it makes no difference to me any more. The entire political game has been unraveled such that no matter who I listen to, I see all the errors in their naive understanding of reality. They are all acting out self-bias and not aware of it.
</p>

<p>
	There is very little serious political understanding in any form of media. It's an echochamber of dogma.

	I notice many of you here have very naive notions of how survival, politics, and economics works.
</p>

<p>
	You are watching some shallow stuff on YT and getting sucked into simplistic ideologies. This is not in line with our work here, which requires deep study and contemplation.

		<p>
			How is it possible that even after being in a state of "no-mind" for so long you can still be pummelled with sexual thoughts? Shouldn't the mind be rewired after a long time of being in that state?
		</p>

		<p>
			What about the "Brahmachari" that claim they are no longer interested in sex after doing various techniques? Are you saying that's bullshit?
		</p>

		<p>
			Also what about females? You only speak of men being "horn dogs" but women are the sexual selectors so they determine men to act this way through selecting these types of men. You only seem to speak about the male role in sex as though it's the only one that's relevant and females have a low responsibility in contributing to these dynamics.
		</p>

		<p>
			Do females still desire sex after prolonged enlightenment or does it manifest in a different way? We don't seem to have enough knowledge about enlightened females, or at least Leo doesn't.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said, sex is deeply wired in you. Good luck undoing that regardless of who you are.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible, but I wouldn't bet on it. Most monks and so forth are merely suppressing it, which means they have the sexual craving but they hide it in order to fit the image of being a good monk.

<p>
	By "being" we mean "is-ing".
</p>

<p>
	Look around your room. The lamp is "being". Everything is being some way, which is what that thing is.
</p>

<p>
	Being is the substance of reality, so to speak. Being is not a specific state you are in. It cuts across all states.

<p>
	Have you not seen animals fighting each other to the death for mating rights?
</p>

<p>
	Some male animals will even kill all the female's babies in order to get her ovulating again so they can impregnate her.
</p>

<p>
	Male chimps have strict dominance hierarchies and it is not unusual for an alpha chimp to rip off a beta chimp's balls so he can't impregnate the females in the troupe.
</p>

<p>
	Chimps are very socially savvy and will team up to out-dominate other chimps for power and sex. Male chimps are frequently beaten to death by gangs of other males.
</p>

<p>
	Reproduction in the animal kingdom is no joke.

<p>
	The Mongols had a long tradition of how to acquire a wife:
</p>

<p>
	You see a woman you like. You kidnap her. You rape and impregnate her. And she becomes your wife. Then you repeat.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try that today.
</p>

<p>
	Survival and reproduction are so deeply linked that you shouldn't even think of them as two different things. Which is why you can't stop thinking about sex even after enlightenment. The deepest Zen master is still a horn dog at heart.

	Good. The more you trip, the deeper you will go and the easier it will get to surrender. Until you hit even deeper levels which you couldn't imagine before, and then it gets hard to surrender again <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

</p>

<p>
	In general, if you want Green+, avoid applying to giant companies. You want a smaller, more personal operation. I would never work for a giant company in any field. It's a meat-grinder and I want no part of it.

Stage Green companies.
</p>

<p>
	But you can't be too idealistic about it because all companies cause collateral damage. You can't run a large company without some exploitation of someone.
</p>

<p>
	For example you could invest in Tesla if you think electric cars are good for mankind. But Tesla of course still exploits its workers.
</p>

<p>
	One of the reasons I don't invest in stocks much any more is because its hard to find non-exploitative ones. I used to invest in oil companies and make a decent return, but can't bring myself to do that any more.
</p>

<p>
	If you really don't want to exploit others, earn your money from your own creative labor, not investing.
</p>

<p>
	It's not a good idea to classify entire stages as masculine or feminine. Masculine/feminine is a typology which cuts across all stages. Likewise, introvert/extrovert cuts across all stages.

<p>
	That's exactly what most Eastern monks and yogis are like. Zen masters are famous for this kind of behavior. They can be very enlightened but sexist, racist, homophobic, nationalistic, etc. because the mind is still at stage Blue due to the culture it is steeped in.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment will not rewire your entire mind and it will not deprogram it of all cultural biases and beliefs. That requires much more work.

	Like all things, government can be used in good ways and bad ways.
</p>

<p>
	Corruption always exists, there are many degrees of it, but it can be rooted out by electing effective higher consciousness leaders with managerial experience.
</p>

<p>
	As but one example, this guy is doing a good job looking out for his people:

<p>
	This is good leadership and good government. Without leadership like this you'd be living in a hellhole.

			My argument was about actual investigations. I am well aware that mindless accusations are problematic, but if there is a basis like being able to investigate all of the visitors of Epsteins island, what speaks against such an investigation and how is it that it hasn't been done?

<p>
	By all means, let the FBI investigate crime.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know they aren't investigating it?
</p>

<p>
	And keep in mind, an investigation is only possible if there is good evidence. Tons of crime goes uninvestigated because the evidence is not strong enough. This doesn't mean it's a conspiracy. The FBI works very hard to nail criminals but it's difficult work.

	In ancient Rome, 30-40% of the population were slaves.
</p>

<p>
	When a neighboring city was conquered, all of its men would have their throats slit, all the women and children would be raped and sold as slaves. That's the true meaning of a war. Every citizen's life is on the line and they know it. If the wall is breached, everyone is fucked.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest reasons men joined the army and went to war is that if they won, they got to rape all the women for free. For many this was their only chance for sex.
</p>

<p>
	We've made some progress.
</p>

<p>
	You live in so much luxury you have no idea what true inequality even means:

<p>
	Vaccines are a public need and I'm not saying they don't have some side-effects. When you have small pox or Black Death, there's a cost to stopping it but the cost of not stopping it is far worse.

	I myself have some legit concerns about heavy metals in vaccines.
</p>

<p>
	But I don't doubt the necessity of some vaccines for serious diseases.

<p>
	That's the thing though.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea what's going on. You have wild speculation and projection which you confuse for truth.

	Good. Thank you.

			I disagree with you regarding 'Conspiracy Theories' and am too not interested in many, just solely interested in the truth. Actually, you'll be surprised to know David Icke always talks about infinite awareness, infinite love, the nature of reality etc before any of the conspiracy stuff, hopefully he will get a lot of his readers interested in spirituality. He often talks about the solution being raising our consciousness and awakening, he even has done Psychedelics a few times
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I am aware of his work.
</p>

<p>
	David Icke is not Awake and he does not embody Love or the highest Truth.
</p>

<p>
	He has some half-assed understanding of how reality works, filtered through his own biases and lack of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Just because he talks about consciousness or love does not mean he really understands how they work.
</p>

<p>
	I find his work to be corrupting the minds of people who should be focused on learning how to Love.
</p>

<p>
	David Icke feeds peoples' base fears. You are not going to awaken that way or become a happy loving person.

<p>
	It's not useless.
</p>

<p>
	I'm just trying to get you to deeply question why you're doing things.
</p>

<p>
	If after deep questioning you decide it's the right thing for you to do, then do it.
</p>

<p>
	I am just offering a new perspective you may not have considered before.
</p>

<p>
	There are many ways to improve body awareness like Tai Chi, yoga, sports, dance, etc.

<p>
	If you guys continue posting these conspiracy theories here you will force me to ban you. This is a misuse of the mind and not in line with the epistemic work we set out to do here.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful watching all the toxic and conspiratorial videos on YT. You are going down toxic rabbit holes which will take you away from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	This is not the forum for such things.
</p>

<p>
	I don't fear the corona virus. Just talking about basic precautions that save lives.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful getting wrapped up in these conspiratorial and cynical ideologies. They are not the way to Truth and Love.

<p>
	This question is still being asked from fear. You are looking for an answer at the level of survival while the real answer is at the level of metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	Have the courage to not feed this fear-based scenario.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine instead that you are such a good person that no one wants to attack you. And if they do, you will be calm enough to endure it. And if they kill you, you will die happy.
</p>

<p>
	After all, even if you are Connor McGregor, I can still just shoot you with a taser and slit your throat with zero training.
</p>

<p>
	You can NEVER win the battle of securing yourself. That's what the wise understand. So they give up that fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	The irony, as with guns, is that you are much more likely to get damaged by your martial training than getting attacked on the street while defenseless.

	But you ain't there. We are trying to guide you there. You won't get there by being stuck in fear.

<p>
	Going defenseless is a great spiritual practice. Is there risk? Of course. That's the point! You consciously bite that bullet.

<p>
	By overlooking the love, you are not spreading awareness, you are spreading selfishness and fear.

<p>
	Loving Bill Gates is the most relevant thing here. For your own sake.
</p>

<p>
	He his helping the world in the best way he knows how. And you are judging him.
</p>

<p>
	You ain't gonna become Turquoise that way.
</p>

<p>
	Let go of the fear. Have the courage to see the kindness and good intentions in your fellow brothers.

Are we meant to merely love him too?

			I can feel myself get worked up about this and I don't like it. Tell me why it's wrong to want powerful people who lie and sexually abuse children to be brought to justice.

<p>
	Nothing is wrong.
</p>

<p>
	You are Jeffery Epstein.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you covering up that everything is you?

			Next fear:

		<p>
			As the physical universe faded, and as sleep faded, as the mind entered deep sleep, the entire universe went to a void. A massive void. Much bigger than a typical zen void. I felt like I was going to a place, completely foreign, and would never ever come back to physical reality. The I was dying rapidly. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Again its super scary because all of maya, rven beyond the physical, seems to dissolve, and there's a strong existential fear of not knowing if you will come back.

<p>
	All fear is overcome with love.

<p>
	Your love must be stronger than your fear.

			I can't stop laughing!!!!!!!
		</p>

		<p>
			So what now? I still want to practice martial arts and to spar. My motivation for it has turned from self-defense and ego preservation and having a strong body and basing my ego off of being disciplined and resilient (when i was 15)  to doing it for beauty, beauty of a strong body, beauty of the range of motion and flexibility a strong body can do (look how beautiful the gymnastic movements are). Also, dueling is beautiful and I feel that it's going to propel me into deeper states of consciousness in the long run. My being craves for the <span>ritualized death of a fight. I want to be put on the line and fight for my life. I also want to get beat, I haven't felt pain in a long time. I feel that getting beat up will allow me to start experiencing life more fully, like a reset on a faulty hardware. Fighting is an expression of my masculinity which I feel inside all of my pores and crave it. Ultimately, it's for consciousness and beauty, and it's out of love. </span>
		</p>

		<p>
			<span>I don't consider it that low consciousness if you approach it in this Fight Club-esque fashion. Of course a machine elf wouldn't be doing any of that, but I'm human. </span>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes there are higher things in life to do! I still can't meditate all day though. I am a guy with a strong masculine essence and martial arts are part of my physical training.

<p>
	Do what you gotta do. Burn through whatever karma you feel you must burn through.
</p>

<p>
	But you are not human.
</p>

<p>
	I am not here to judge you. I'm just pointing out a higher possibility of who you can be. If you want to master punching creatures in the face, go for it. But try to understand why that looks silly from my POV.
</p>

<p>
	What if you mastered love instead?
</p>
