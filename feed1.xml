<p>
	It's important to stay conscious that all "other" is really yourself. Even if the other is harsh.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise you're in duality.
</p>

<p>
	So I would practice integrating that experience in a way where you're not separating yourself from whoever/whatever that thing was. Then maybe next time it won't feel so "other" or foreign.
</p>

<p>
	If plugged DMT works similar to plugged 5-MeO, it will be an amazing ROA. My best guess is that plugging DMT is better than vaporizing it. Most people vaporize simply because they have not been shown a better way. And because most DMT is sold as freebase. I'll try out both methods and let you guys know my results.

<p>
	Of course.
</p>

<p>
	Par for the course.
</p>

<p>
	You can't awaken without facing your greatest fears.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot here. They are the best tool for facing existential fear head on.

Ruper spira says that attention only serves as directing consciousness away from consciousness towards an object (breath, thoughts for example), in order for consciousness to be aware of consciousness attention has to stop, and that meditation techniques that require the focus of attention only serve to calm the mind and are only preliminary exercises. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Doesnt this contradict what you said in your self inquiry video that one has to concentrate on pure nothingness? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There's really no contradiction. Just different ways to phrasing the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation techniques which focus attention are very good. I wouldn't besmirch them as merely "preliminary exercises." Self-inquiry is a concentration exercise.
</p>

<p>
	It is also possible to meditate on nothingness. But it's an advanced kind of meditation which is not easy for most people to do because the mind easily clings on to some form. So instead most newbies are taught a technique like: focus on the breath.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to put your attention on Nothingness if you're very conscious. It requires taking your attention off of all form. Basically you're trying to become conscious of formlessness, Shiva, or the Godhead.
</p>

<title>80h work week how to be effective ?</title>

<p>
	It's not feasible in the long-term. And the deeper question is, why are you interested in working that much at all since work will never make you happy? It clearly shows that you have your priorities backward.
</p>

<p>
	Work is endless. It's an endless game of chasing one's tail. You want your work to be enjoyable and you want to have lots of spare time for spirituality, personal development, and enjoyment of life.
</p>

<p>
	What you want is not effectiveness or success, but consciousness, joy, peace, and health.
</p>

<p>
	Working long hours should only be done for short periods of time for critical strategic purposes, like if you're launching a new business you might work really hard for a year or two, but only because you'll then have more free time.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Nothingness is prior to mind, space, or anything else.
</p>

<p>
	The answer is "sorta." Attention is put on it through the self-inquiry process. Your mind must become very still and your concentration laser focused.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse this with putting your attention on some idea or concept of nothingness. I am talking about ACTUAL nothingness, not any idea you have. An idea you have of it, is not it, and it will prevent you from accessing it. So be careful. DO NOT TRY TO IMAGINE NOTHINGNESS. That is a giant waste of time. It will not work and you will not even be close.
</p>

<p>
	Or a psychedelic can take you there easily.
</p>

<p>
	It's best not to think of it as "putting my attention of nothingness" but rather, nothingness is what you ARE. You are it. It is your truest nature. So rather than looking for nothingness, look for what you are, your truest nature. When I say "you" I am talking to that nothingness you are.
</p>

<title>Vaporhuasca vs vaporized 5 Meo NN DMT.</title>

<p>
	Sounds like you accessed channeling. Very interesting.
</p>

<p>
	I didn't know that MAOI would affect vaporized DMT. That's kinda odd since it was already active. I guess MAOI just supercharges any substance.
</p>

<p>
	Have you tried plugging DMT salt? That should last 45 mins or more and be smoother than vaping with no MAOI required.
</p>

<p>
	Warning: combining 5-MeO-DMT with MAOI can be lethal. Never do that.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is still extremely powerful. And you can increase the dose to the point of whiting out. So lack of intensity is not a problem.
</p>

<p>
	It's just more gentle and longer-lasting.
</p>

<p>
	That gentleness is very good. You don't want to freak yourself out or overload your system. It's also easier to keep your eyes open.

	It's basically impossible to become wealthy without learning business, sales, and marketing and being very serious about business. Business does not tolerate bullshit and wishful thinking. You must deliver hard results or you're dead. Most people cannot handle that. It's brutal.

<p>
	That's a bad way to frame it.
</p>

<p>
	The whole distinction between conscious and unconscious is bogus. There is only consciousness at various levels.
</p>

<p>
	Trips are super-conscious.
</p>

<p>
	Freud and Jung are not good teachings. They did not understand nonduality. Jung has some redeeeming quilities, but still not good enough for our purposes.

</blockquote>

<p>
	They are one and the same, but they are simultaneously distinct. Just like how a coffee table is located in space, yet it is distinct from space. You can have space without a coffee table. Or space with a coffee table.
</p>

<p>
	Phenomena occur inside the witness (we could say). Phenomena are also identical to the witness. And the witness is also distinct from all phenomena. These are various aspects of nonduality which you will have to realize individually, and also together all at once.
</p>

<p>
	A good order of progression is first to realize the witness as distinct from phenomena. Then to realize that since the witness is nothing and nowhere, it is everywhere and everything, including all phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	Something which is nothing and nowhere is also everything and everywhere. That's what you're missing. The witness is not a point in space, it is omnipresent, sort of like how a vacuum is omnipresent.
</p>

	How can anyone answer that for you? If you're gonna be a badass sage, you gotta figure it out.

<p>

The perfect person you imagine would actually be extra depressed because he sees it's not working, it's all a house of cards.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's general advice for all psychs.
</p>

<p>
	Our goal here is to recognize nonduality in everyday life. You need to realize what perceptions are. You need to experience your room and your body as God. So that when you arr sober still know that form and formlessness are one.
</p>

<p>
	It's SO critical to realize that form and formlessness are identical. Otherwise you're still in duality.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is gonna be a very different experience. Very gentle yet strong and lasting for 60 mins.

</p>

<p>
	Really, it was too powerful. Blasting into outer space is not ideal.
</p>

<p>
	Try plugging 20mg. It will be a very different experience. Make sure you keep your eyes open. It's important that you don't fly off to some other dimension but realize that the Absolute is ordinary life, not some colorful fractal.
</p>

<p>
	Medium dose, eyes open, and contemplate.
</p>

<p>
	Your sensitivity will only increase as you have breakthroughs.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out with mushrooms. They will become much more powerful and 5-MeO-like. Scale back all your dosages for all substances.

</p>

<p>
	Be very careful mixing psychedelics with modafinil. Reports seem to suggest that it's not a good combo. But I have not verified it personally.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, LSD is a very powerful tool, not to be taken lightly.

	Sounds like its a problem of hyper-masculinity. Attachment to the macho identity.

<p>
	Although I haven't watched his videos for about 4 years. Sounds like he's drunk the MGTOW Kool-Aid. Which is a shame. It means he's developing a stage Green shadow a la Jordan Peterson.

He has the responsibility to call the ambulance when the situation gets totally out of control. So basically yeah, you should have no other people around you. So living in a big city, it could be a problem. But if you start with a relatively low dose, you will still have some control</span>
		</p>

		<p>
			<span>Actually, I dont remember screaming at all. I was told that I "fainted" for about a minute or so. So that dose was definitely the end of my bodys capacity to handle the substance. I wasnt in control of screaming or not. I simply dont remember it. For me that minute doesnt even exist. It is as if I had tripped permanently without any gaps.</span>

I filled the syringe with about 1 ml of vinegar and just tried drop after drop. Then it solves as nicely as if you put water on HCl. The solution becomes very clear and has no colour. So I do it directly before administration. But I assume if you let the rest of the liquid evaporate, you can still store the acetate solid form quite nicely. I think the salt forms are best for storage (in the freezer).

	It's wrong in the sense that police show up or neighbors disturb you. You need to trip in a responsible manner. If you start running around the street naked, that's no good, even if it feels natural to you while you're high.

			It is only unreal from a very specific viewpoint, which is of the neophyte meditator. There is no such thing as 'asbolute', 'maya' or 'real'. This all sounds very confusing, no? To get people interested in the work, teachers often use bad metaphors and analogies. It's like how they teach you Newtonian physics before quantum. I find this approach to be more confusing than helpful.

<p>
	As you become more and more successful you will realize how hollow and unsatisfying success is. You will experience depression and disappointment. That will force you to re-evaluate your happiness strategy. Eventually you will have to admit that the only way to become happy is to awaken. And then you will pursue awakening in earnest.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of chasing before we realize that chasing does not work.

	Really? It's a good book? It seems to have no substance to it.

<p>
	I don't understand how Jamie is such a brilliant speaker yet his book and some of his talks about "flow" seem to be full of buzz-words yet no substance. What am I missing? It seems very commercialized in that cheesy Tony Robbins vein.

	Guys, you must do the work and have your own insights. My answers cannot help you.
</p>

<p>
	Take the things I say as loose orienting pointers.
</p>

<p>
	This is very advanced and tricky stuff. You will have to go through a lot of struggle to ultimately understand it.
</p>

<p>
	Self-deception is always possible. You must always be open to that possibility.
</p>

<p>
	But there is Absolute Truth. You must discover that for yourselves. I have discovered it for myself and that's all that ultimately matters to me.
</p>

<p>
	To doubt the Absolute is itself a self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	They didn't look like anything. It was a purely formless understanding. It's just one of the many consequences of nonduality. If you are conscious that everything is nondual, then you realize that you were the dinosuars. Seeing the dinosuars is not necessary to realize this.

From higher levels you will see there are no enemies.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, any stage can have a lapse in awareness. Awareness goes up and down all day long. That's not the issue. The issue is your stage of development.
</p>

<p>
	There are valid criticisms of Green, but you are criticizing Green from below, not above. Seems like you are Blue/Orange.

<title>Sadhguru on 8 types of samadhi states and liberation.</title>

<p>
	Sadhguru says it well.
</p>

<p>
	But it is also possible to preview this Nirvana temporarily -- in case you want to know what it's like without fully exiting this life.
</p>

<p>
	You will dissolve totally into the universe. Then you will return to human form and be able to talk about it. Although it's so nondual there's not much that you can say about it.
</p>

<p>
	It is a total lack of discrimination. The collapse of all distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	Then you can decide whether that's something you really want. This whole liberation business is often framed as "you must do this, this is the highest" but there's also nothing wrong with exploring the formed realm. Don't be in too much of a rush to liberation. Explore the formed realm well first. Then, if you are sick of it, you could consider liberation. Liberation is not better than anything else. Liberation is just the organic end point of doing a lot of exploration of reality to the point where you've explored so much of it that you say, "Okay, I'm good. I've had my fill. Time for peace". Very few people are at this point. Don't rush too much to get to this point, it should be organic.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that life is about the journey, not the destination. Try to enjoy the spiritual journey rather than rushing to some ultimate end-point.
</p>

<p>
	It makes no sense to the ego-mind because the ego-mind is constantly trying to survive. The ego-mind as a mechanism does not allow you to feel happy other than as a manipulation or a reward for survival. So you are like a dog stuck in a cycle of chasing dog biscuits without realizing that there is an endless mountain of dog biscuits right over the hill. But you are so hungry for that one biscuit that you never go over the hill to dog heaven <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Motivation is a manipulation mechanism that the mind uses over you. Notice how easily you're controlled by the promise of a little pleasure in the future. You are so controlled by it you wouldn't even take infinite happiness if it was offered to you. Because you'd say, "But that would mean I have to stop chasing crumbs." Yes, you'd have to stop chasing crumbs.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you have been offered a billion dollars but you say, "I'm too busy to take this billion dollars because I'm busy chasing millions of dollars." Well, okay, have it your way.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Similarly, why not just pursue enlightenment and say fuck off to the rest of personal development and your life areas (social, career, hobbies, etc) as you will already be happy? Why not just sit down and do nothing every day? Is it that the joy from unconditional happiness great isnt that great of a feeling and other things provide some more upward curves? Does unconditional happiness just move the baseline?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Indeed. That's what an intelligent person would do.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, you can't do it. Because you're too hypnotized and addicted to life.
</p>

<p>
	Are you really willing to sacrifice your entire life for God? If so, do it.
</p>

<p>
	You are totally underestimating what awakening offers. It doesn't just offer happiness. It offers immortality and God-realization. You cannot even fathom such kinds of joy. It is a joy beyond anything you've experienced in your life. The technical terms for it are Bliss, Ecstasy, and Paradise.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a literal Paradise. That's what you're missing by not fully awakening. So what's the catch? The cost of attaining this Paradise is surrendering your entire life. Which is of course out of the question for you.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	See, the problem is, you don't have any reference point for what an Absolute is. You don't even understand that an Absolute is possible. Because all you've experienced in your life are relative things.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute means it is true under all possible circumstances. It was true before the Big Bang happened and it will be true after our universe ends.
</p>

<p>
	An Absolute is not state-dependent, it is not a function of the human mind, it is not an experience, it is not an perception, it is not belief, it is not an assumption, it is not a theory, it is not a thought, it is not an intuition. It is ABSOLUTE!

	Facing your fears is one of the keys to life.
</p>

<p>
	1-2g of mushrooms in a good setting should be a wonderful thing.
</p>

<p>
	Bad trips come and go. Not such a big deal. You're not going to break your brain with 1-2g of mushrooms. The worst that can happen is you will freak out a bit. But even that is not a big issue on 1-2g. The real mindfuckery begins around 4g.
</p>

<p>
	1g is a very safe starter dose. 2g is pretty awesome but still within the realm of reality. And at 4g reality starts to collapse in really twisted ways.
</p>

<p>
	I remember in my worst trip, at 4g, I realized I was all the dinosaurs who ever lived. That was freaky.

<p>
	You oversimplify this whole process.
</p>

<p>
	If that worked for you, great. But that it's not going to be that easy for most people. There is much more to this work than just watching the breath. If it was that simple, then spiritual traditions would be that simple and there wouldn't be tens of thousands of pages of Buddhist scripture mapping out various spiritual realizations and other nuances.
</p>

<p>
	No one is saying enlightenment is not one. It is of course one. But there are many degrees and facets to that one. The ocean is one but it has many depths and areas to explore.

			Yeah I really wanted my trips to be contemplative and productive but I get so distracted by the psychology-based insights I keep having. That stuff's productive, sure, but it's still based on form. I struggle with being distracted in my day to day life along with over-theorising, so maybe it's my ego trying to hold on and knowing how to stop me going deeper.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's not necessarily wrong. It might just mean that you have some psychological baggage to work through to prepare you for the really deep existential insights which will inevitably come if you keep tripping consistently.
</p>

<p>
	I have a theory that most ordinary people, if they do a bit of psychedelics, will not get deep metaphysical insights because they have a lot of psychological baggage to clear up first. They aren't pure enough, and they aren't existentially curious enough. The psychedelic will show you the answers you NEED and also the answers your heart is seeking. What does your heart want to know? If it doesn't want to know much, then you won't get much.
</p>

<p>
	For me, my heart was always seeking the deepest answers to why reality exists. And so I get those answers very quickly on psychedelics. Because I care about understanding reality so much. It's really my purpose for living. So the psychedelic takes me there almost instantly. It's nuts. You have to really care to know.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really actively contemplate on psychedelics. Most of my contemplation is during everyday life. But that then sort of builds up a deep curiosity which then gets answered in the trip. I don't try to control my trips much. I just sit down and say something to myself like, "Okay, now show me the highest Truth! Whatever it is, I want to know and I will accept it. Lay it on me. What am I still missing? What am I still not understanding about reality?"
</p>

<p>
	Usually that triggers a torrent of profound revelations. Sometimes it can be uncomfortable.
</p>

We are so busy that we don't gives ourselves time to just hang out and do nothing. Even when we meditate we tend to be busy doing meditation.

Play some chill tunes while you drive and enjoy the lights.
</p>

<p>
	That's probably my fave way to integrate. Driving puts me in a great mellow meditative mood. A sort of integrative flow state. Road trips out in nature in the wild are also amazing for this. Do a 3 hour road trip through a mountain, forest, or desert. Those are some of my fondest times.

<p>
	Like I said before, there are many degrees to awakening and nonduality. Many facets. Very few people are totally awake or understand all the facets and degrees.
</p>

<p>
	"Normal enlightened person" is simply too vague of a term. Some of those people have very shallow levels of realization, and some of them have very deep levels of realization. Lumping all enlightened people into one bucket just isn't accurate and creates misunderstanding, turning enlightenment into a binary, one-dimensional thing when it is not.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying 5-MeO is the best or deepest. I'm just saying it's a very powerful tool which many people are dismissing to their own detriment. I don't want to turn this into a nonduality dick measuring contest. There are just degrees of it.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Sam Harris is nowhere near awakened. He's had some minor insights into no-self, but that's a far cry from the kind of stuff one realizes on 5-MeO. He still has a massive ego and that damned materialist, rationalist, dualistic attitude. He has not realized God or Infinity or total nonduality, or many others important things.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there is a difference between 5-MeO and a classic shift into non-dual awareness. 5-MeO-DMT is more temporary but more profound and more powerful. It's impermanent precisely because it is so powerful it's almost impossible to function from such a high level of consciousness. You need something more tame and stable for everyday life.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a degree of nondual awareness so high that you couldn't even walk. You would just be writhing around on the floor in astonishment like a flapping fish as your mind connects to universal intelligence and fathoms everything in existence.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I would just say, keep observing. A few days of observing are not enough. You need months and years of observing. The observation process itself is curative and self-correcting. You don't necessarily need to "do" anything about it. Just observe all your survival mechanisms at work. Observe why you feel you need them. Observe your attachment to them. As you do that, their grip over you loosens. Then you are more free to behave however you want without being dominated by survival concerns.
</p>

<p>
	For example, observe how you manipulate people and why you feel you need to. That's very eye-opening and there's a lot to observe there. Observation is not the same thing as stopping your manipulation. I'm not asking you to stop anything. I'm just asking you to observe. With lots of good observation, many manipulations will naturally fall away. Not all, but many.

	I am still always a bit anxious before doing a hit. Because I understand the power of it and a little anxiety is good, it humbles the ego. You need to respect these powerful substances because they can easily kick your ass if you get too cocky and casual. Respect psychedelics like a loaded gun.

<p>
	That is interesting. I assumed Bufo needs to be vaporized because it is not pure 5-MeO and contains toxins. Not sure if I want to stick those toxins up my butt. During vaporization the bufotenine and toxins are supposed to be burned off.
</p>

<p>
	But I'll probably try plugging it just to see what happens.
</p>

<p>
	Bufotenine is not a pleasant psychedelic to take. It has high body load and weird physiological effects. It's going to taint the pure 5-MeO experience. I'm just not sure by how much. Maybe by a little, maybe by a lot.
</p>

<p>
	My ultimate goal is to compare synthetic and natural versions of 5-MeO to see which one is best for consciousness work.

<p>
	Emotions are self-manipulations doing the work of survival.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become, the less you will need to rely on them to live life. You can live your life more consciously instead.
</p>

<p>
	Emotions are like the strings of the puppet-master's hand controlling the puppet. Resisting feelings is just one more string. Being run by feelings is all the strings. Consciousness is seeing the entire mechanism at work from a detached meta-perspective. No string is good or bad, good and bad are themselves strings invented by the puppet-master to tighten his control over the puppet.

<p>
	Such a door exists. It's called 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, most ego-minds are too terrified to walk through such a door. They cannot help themselves. Their ignorance is too deep.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to hide an amazing thing from everyone is to make it too good to be true. Then no one will bother to try it under the assumption that nothing can really be as good as that.
</p>

<p>
	Therein lies the whole tragedy of our situation. We are in heaven but we insist on creating our own hell.

<p>
	It will be too radical for you to properly integrate. You risk freaking out and abandoning psychedelics altogether from one overwhelming experience.
</p>

<p>
	Start small. Don't rush. There is no rush. The field of psychedelic is so wide and deep it will take you many years and hundreds of trips to explore it all.
</p>

<p>
	Slow and steady is better than hard and fast when it comes to transforming yourself. Hard and fast changes tend not to stick and produce lots of ego backlash and frustration.
</p>

<p>
	Do not dismiss the power of psychedelics like mushrooms or LSD. They are fantastic, magical tools. 5-MeO is just so good that it is in a class all by itself. If God existed in powdered from, it would be 5-MeO-DMT. And luckily it does exist in such a form.

<p>
	I think you should be fine. Just start with small doses and work up. Frying would only be a thing at very high doses.

<p>
	Plugging is by far the smoothest and safest method.

</p>

<p>
	I get very little body load on 5-MeO. LSD and 2-CB have much worse body load for me.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, also make sure your 5-MeO is pure. It should be white-colored. Any other coloration is impurities.

Just doing opposite things automatically sounds mechanical and not conscious. The solution is to do things more consciously.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, challenging your automatic survival reactions is good. It is harder than merely observing. It's the next step after lots of observing.
</p>

<p>
	There is no categorization per se. 99% of all the stuff you do every day are your survival mechanisms. Rather than trying to categorize them, observe them. Categorizing stuff tends to itself be a survival mechanism. Why are you categorizing stuff? To help you do what?

<p>
	I have been meaning to. But plugging has been so incredibly effective and perfect that nothing more could be wanted. At least that's how it feels inside the trip. Outside the trip my mind can come up with all sorts of other stuff to try.
</p>

<p>
	I'm a little wary of smoking because I don't want to blow out my energetic system. Too much 5-MeO too fast does not feel healthy to me.
</p>

<p>
	But I am open to smoking it. In fact I will try Bufo soon.

<p>
	Identification and survival is an extremely complex and sophisticated mechanism. It's got may layers to it, most of which are of course subconscious.
</p>

<p>
	It's a complex tangled mess that takes not just years, but DECADES, to fully understand and deconstruct. It must be this way because your entire life hinges upon it. If it was not this complex and sophisticated you'd be dead a long time ago.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get discouraged. Keep slowly untangling that mess.
</p>

<p>
	Virtually EVERYTHING your mind and body does, from morning to night is survival. Almost not a single thought crosses your mind which is not related to your survival. You need to take this point very seriously. Really notice it. You must notice how survival dominates your entire life on a second by second basis. And all of that is tied in directly with ego and identification. They are so closely tied that you don't know the difference between yourself and your survival. Every emotional disturbance you experience is survival-in-action. EMOTIONS ARE SURVIVAL! THOUGHTS ARE SURVIVAL!
</p>

<p>
	The significance of this cannot be overstated.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to it is, you observe it. Like an owl watches a mouse. The more you observe, the freer you become of it, the less it controls you like a puppet.
</p>

	God is very big! Very, very, very BIG!
</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	If you plug it rather than smoke it, the experience will be much, much smoother and gentler.
</p>

<p>
	But it will still mindfuck you real good.
</p>

<p>
	Conquering your fear is a major part of this whole process. There cannot be deep awakening without facing your deepest fear of death. Awakening is that which lies beyond death. First you die. Then you see God. Then you laugh.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I don't think Bufo can be plugged though. That's one of its downsides.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it like going on a big rollercoaster.

<p>
	It cannot be otherwise. Survival requires identification. The function of identification is to single out what must be survived. If you didn't have an identification you would not be able to tell yourself apart from a chair, and you would not know which of the two is more important to defend and protect.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire mind is what you identify with, and what you try to survive. Into this are tied all of your thoughts, beliefs, opinions, attitudes, behaviors, emotions, reactions, knowledge, etc. That entire tangled mess is the self/ego-mind. Its job is to survive at all costs. Which is why changing any part of yourself is so hard. All change is perceived as death and resisted with a vengeance.

It's not an iffy thing. It's not just that you see an amazing vision which is so beautiful it could only be the work of God. No. You literally realize: "OMG! OMG! OMG! I! AM! GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" It's not an idea. It's not a belief. It's even an experience per se. It's actual God. You realize what the word God actually means for the first time in your life.
</p>

<p>
	God is unlimited everything.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize God, there is absolute certainty. There is no doubt whatsoever. God is impossible to doubt. The entire universe finally makes sense to you.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with 300ug of LSD is that the visuals and body load becomes so overwhelming they become a distraction from direct contemplation of What am I? What is reality? What is God?
</p>

<p>
	Although I've realized God on 125ug of LSD. But I'm very sensitiveness to psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	You want to lower your psychedelic doses so you can contemplate and stay focused. A high dose is actually counter-productive to our aims here. A wacky crazy fun trip is not the same as a productive contemplative trip.

<p>
	Watching the breath is a surprisingly powerful technique.
</p>

<p>
	But I also find that deconstruction is necessary. A lot of meditators spend years watching the breath but never awaken because that's usually not enough. The materialist paradigm and stuff like the self/other distinction is still there, operating in the background, grounding one's reality. Such anchor points must be questioned and deconstructed. It's easy to watch your breath for 10 years all the while thinking you are just a human being in a physical body separate from the world and other people.
</p>

<p>
	Watching the breath is really good once you've questioned the materialist paradigm to death. Then watching the breath can feel open and spacious, almost like a mild trip.
</p>

<p>
	Regarding the Buddha, the thing is, whatever the Buddha did 2500 years ago, today we live in a much different environment. The Buddha did not have TV, internet, porn, radio, YouTube, video games, high school, university, etc. The Buddha's mind was not filled with a bunch of materialist and scientific concepts. This made things much easier for the Buddha than for today's average person who's head is filled with thousands of concepts through school and university and culture. That stuff needs a lot of deconstructing. The success of technology makes scientific materialism seem unquestionably true and real in a way that it was not 2500 years ago. The Buddha grew up in a highly spiritual culture whereas we are in a highly materialistic and atheistic culture.

			Buddah denied God

<p>
	Buddha did not deny God. Buddha is God. He was just humble about it. Don't confuse humility with denial of the obvious.
</p>

<p>
	You must be extremely careful about the context of spiritual teachings. Everything Osho is talking about when he is denying God is actually not in contradiction to what I say. He is speaking against the stage Blue Christian version of God as a bearded man in the clouds. Yes, that God is a human invention.
</p>

<p>
	But then there is ACTUAL God, which is identical with existence.
</p>

<p>
	You must understand spiritual communications in their totality rather than just seeing words like "there is no God" and taking them at face value.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual teachers often like to be provocative. For example, if a Christian student comes to a Zen master and asks him about God, the master will tell him there is no God, drop it. But if an atheist student comes to the same Zen master and starts telling him how there is no God, the Zen master will tell him that God is real.
</p>

<p>
	Why is it done this way? Because the dualistic mind clings to images and beliefs rather than directly experiencing the truth of things. So the #1 job of a guru is to break your mind's rigidity.
</p>

<p>
	If I was talking to a fundamentalist Christian, I would tell him there is no God. Because if tell him there is a God, he will think I am talking about his image of God, which is not God at all. He needs to drop that image. ACTUAL God is nothing like his image. It's almost the opposite of his image.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that Buddhists don't have a God is a very bad misunderstanding of Buddhism. Every seriously realized Buddhist knows what God is. They just don't use a bunch of godly language. They like to call it Emptiness. Which the unawakened person (the outsider like you) misunderstands as being the opposite of God, when in fact it is the very essence of God!
</p>

<p>
	See how tricky language can be?
</p>

<p>
	By being existence, you will come know yourself as God.
</p>

<title>Is mental illness attached to the ego?</title>

<p>
	In reality these are very complex issues with many possible factors. Of course ego and psychology plays a huge role, but brain health and diet also plays an important role. For example, if your brain is filled with toxic chemicals like lead and mercury, good luck feeling well.
</p>

<p>
	You have to research and investigate what your root issues are. Ego is always gonna be a huge factor but there might also be other factors.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of mental illness is due to traumatic and terrible childhoods, improper parenting, etc. BTW, I don't consider depression a mental illness. Yes, ego is also closely related to mental illnesses because what happens is that early childhood trauma is not properly dealt with by the ego, which then produces all sorts of dysfunctions. Of course serious mental illnesses can also have physiological factors. It's usually a combination of factors.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate how powerful the ego is. It's running your whole life pretty much. It dictates most of your survival strategies and emotional reactions.
</p>

	You need to be wise enough to discern when you are being distracted by fools. Otherwise it will take you 100 years to awaken. There is too much bullshit on the internet to treat it all seriously.

<p>
	Anyone who would go on PragerU is not to be taken seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Find yourself better sources. That's my point.
</p>

<p>
	See, it would be a mistake to take a propaganda source seriously, as though it was on the same level as an awakened teaching. This is the mistake of false equivalency. Being openmidned does not mean you let people propagandize you.

<p>
	It takes nuance to be able to discern what is and what isn't propaganda.

<p>
	He is a saavy exploiter of the culture wars. That's why he rose in popularity. Not because he makes good intellectual arguments. Those arguments are egoic justifications. They come from lack of self-awareness.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't confuse popularity with truthfulness or quality. They are usually inversely proportional.

Allow them and just watch them like clouds in the sky. Sometime they will take hold of you. Strong emotions will hypnotize you into a trace of believing in them. Just do your best to notice that and take a step back and witness it. That is all.
</p>

<p>
	Your job in this work is to make EVERY form/perception an object of your witnessing. It cannot become an object to witness if you are identified with it. To witness it, you must first disidentify with it. So for example, you are not the sensation in your chest, you are that which is witnessing that sensation. You are not the thought of yourself, you are that which is witnessing that thought. You are not the hunger in your belly, you are that which is witnessing that feeling. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Just keep practicing that as much as you can throughout the day. The more the better. You will become more and more detached from everything, which is the goal. Eventually you should have an awakening to Absolute Emptiness that is your true identity. It will come suddenly and out of the blue. Often it's jolting.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, keep entering that state of not-knowing what anything is. That's very good. That is the best state to be in for an awakening to happen.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Go and actually study and gain experience with attracting girls and being social. Do that first. Fill that need. Then you can return to enlightenment work. You are getting ahead of yourself, jumping into too advanced territory without having done the basics. That's why you're frustrated.
</p>

<p>
	GO SOCIALIZE WITH REAL GIRLS!!!
</p>

<p>
	Stop trying to avoid it. You are using the idea of enlightenment to avoid doing basic self-help stuff. That is not right.

<p>
	You are not anything. Keep disidentifying with everything until nothing remains. It's basically as simple as that. The ego will of course react and object and throw hissy-fits.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever negative reactions are arising, you must watch them without identifying with them or taking them too seriously. Like watching clouds passing through the sky. The sky does not get bothered by the clouds. You are like the sky. Be like the sky.
</p>

<p>
	Insecurity is one of those clouds passing through.
</p>

<p>
	One awakening is rarely enough to fully disidentify from the body/mind. Keep challenging anything you identify with. Keep asking yourself, "What am I still identified with? Can I let that go?" Your ultimate goal is to completely disidentify with the entire sensory realm. All forms must be dropped. No form is your true identity. Your true identity is totally empty, a Void.
</p>

Not any particular object, but just the pure fact of existence itself. What is that?

<p>
	Existence itself is not a color, object, material, sound, feeling, thought, etc. It is not even an experience or a perception. What is it then?

	It's very important for everyone here to understand that not all people react to 5-MeO alike. I have seen people take 30mg of good, 99% substance without much reaction.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect everyone to be able to take 20mg and have an epic breakthrough experience like I talk about. You need to find what dose and method works best for you. This is an individualized thing.

<p>
	It's purely a right-wing propaganda channel. It does not even attempt to understand the issues.
</p>

<p>
	One good thing about PragerU is that it reveals who the fake experts are. Any "expert" or "intellectual" you see on in their videos automatically exposes himself as a clown, and is never to be taken seriously.

Assuming nothingness is something, of course.

<p>
	Well, nothingness is not something. And also it is <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> (sorry for the Zen-speak)
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness is existence itself. If you just sit with a quiet mind in silence you can sort of "feel" existence. Although feeling is not quite the right word. You can be conscious of existence.
</p>

<p>
	Try this: just sit and focus your attention on the raw fact of existence itself. I don't mean on the existence of any particular object, but existence itself. Try to "lock on" to existence itself. Notice it has no shape. It has no form. It is not an object. Yet here it is! But WHAT IS IT? What is existence? Try to just sit and be "locked on" to that for 15 minutes with a very open mind. Don't theorize or speculate. Just observed what existence is. Have a very open mind free of any ideas, models, images, or theories about what existence is. Whatever existence is, it's right there in your direct experience. if you can't realize what it is using your direct experience, you will never realize it (not through books, videos, or teaching).
</p>

<p>
	Can you sort of "feel" that existence is nothing? It is empty. Good. Now just sit with that. Focus on that emptiness. That is enlightenment, that is the True Self, that is the I AM, that is the Godhead.
</p>

<p>
	Also notice that anything you say about pure existence itself is not accurate. Any description or qualification of it is not true because it is empty. It is so empty that even calling it "empty" is untrue! So what do you do? You just sit and observe it silently without too much thinking. Let it captivate you. Rather than being human, become it!

</p>

<p>
	The mind is NOT the I AM. The mind will try to make itself feel and think that it is the I AM, so watch out! You must detach from all mind activity. That doesn't mean all mind activity must stop, it just means you must not identify with it.
</p>

<p>
	What you are looking for is Nothingness. But it cannot be found using the mind. So how do you find it? There is no way, no method to get to it. A radical leap in consciousness is required. That comes naturally with lots of practice witnessing and observing your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	You must throw out all analogies. Enlightenment/Nothingness cannot be accessed via an analogy AT ALL. Every analogy is not it. You must become the Nothingness directly! It has to be totally direct. You cannot form an image or idea of it. Any idea you have of it is not it. This is why it's so frustrating and difficult.
</p>

<p>
	Closest you can get to Nothingness via a technique is just sitting in silence with a very still mind.
</p>

<title>Q&amp;A: Realization of God's Perfect Design and it's Consequences</title>

</p>

<p>
	Notice, even to understand that a cake goes in an oven requires that you make use of the intellectual capacities of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	In a strictly materialist universe, no understanding would be possible at all. You could not understand how to tie your shoes. Understanding is a divine capacity. And since you are God, your capacity to understand yourself is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	The little things you understand in your everyday life, like how to turn on the lights in your house, is a tiny, tiny fraction of the intelligence of the super-mind which you can tap into. With super-mind you can understand amazing things about reality which seem impossible to ordinary people. For example, you can understand why wars happen, or why corruption exists, or why racism exists, etc.
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem is, every force in nature has a countervailing force. So the force of enlightening others will be countered by the force of ignorance and devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Key insight: people are not awake because they don't want to be, not because something is seriously stopping them. People like their illusions. When you try to take that away from them, don't be surprised if they kill you.
</p>

<p>
	If everyone awoke tomorrow, the entire civilization would collapse. So civilization needs to evolve before mass awakening is possible.

We are talking about the same thing in different ways.
