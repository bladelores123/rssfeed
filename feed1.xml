<p>
	As you know, many of those New Agers and Hippies tend to be stage Green. Which makes them much more evolved and conscious than the average person. So are they closer to awakening? Sure, but most of them are still very far.
</p>

<p>
	It's easier to awaken a hippie than a redneck.

</p>

<p>
	The devil's favorite defense mechanism is distraction and corruption of the highest truth. If the devil can de-fang a spiritual teaching by turning it into a New Age fad, that's ideal for his purposes!
</p>

<p>
	How easy would enlightenment be if all spiritual teachings led directly to God? Too easy! The devil's gotta muddy those waters to hell so no one finds the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Direct spiritual teachings are too hardcore for most people. So they need to be watered down for mainstream audiences, but in doing so they become completely ineffective and even counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	And, BTW, making fun of and judging pseudo-woke spiritual New Agers is itself a distraction <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

As the Buddhists like to point out.
</p>

<p>
	If you go to a hell realm eventually you will wake up. All formed realms are like dreams. They last some while and then God wakes up.
</p>

<p>
	Pain is imaginary, as are all realms.

It cannot be doubted.
</p>

<p>
	The end result of openmindedness is Absolute Truth, as which point you are beyond the mind entirely and you are never going back nor will be ever compromise with ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Don't mistake openmindedness for compromise with ignorance.

<p>
	There is no formula for it. You push as hard as you can until you can't go further.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like you're asking: How do I know how many miles I can run before I am too tired to run any more?
</p>

<p>
	Go do it and see where your limit is. Then train some more and your limit will rise.
</p>

<p>
	There are many aspects of your life you could work on developing if you don't feel ready for the Fully Monty yet. Go work on your career/life purpose or your relationships or your diet or your self-esteem. All of that is good stuff.
</p>

<title>10 Day 1st Retreat Report and Questions</title>

<p>
	Regardless of your results, that was a very powerful step in your journey.
</p>

<p>
	Congrats for doing it! Anyone who completes a 10-day solo retreat has my respect. It's one of the hardest things in the world.
</p>

<p>
	To get serious results on retreats though you should be meditating/concentrating 10-12 hours per day. It takes enormous effort.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Next time, double the volume of your microphone. Very hard to hear it.
</p>

In which case focus on basic self-help.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, when will you ever be ready? No one is ever ready for the Truth. It skull-fucks you either way. Because reality is a grand thing. It ain't no small thing to create the entire universe from scratch.
</p>

<p>
	The funny thing is, all fear is illusion. Fear is literally nothing! Since you are immortal.
</p>

<p>
	You are like the groundhog who saw his own shadow and ran away in fear. After you awaken you will laugh and laugh at how silly you were.

<p>
	Einstein was politically very progressive & liberal. He saw the Nazi threat very early before any of his colleagues did. He fled Nazi Germany long before the war started and he spoke out against the dangers of nationalism. After the war there was a movement to create Israel. Some top Jewish leaders tried to recruit Einstein to their cause. But Einstein was too conscious for that. He saw that the Jews are embarking along a similar path as the Nazi's with their own flavor of Jewish nationalism (Zionism). He warned about these dangers.
</p>

<p>
	And today we see that this is the case. Far right-wing Jewish nationalists are dedicated to oppressing the Palestinian people in their quest for a pure Zion.
</p>

<p>
	It's ironic that those Jews never learned the true lesson of Nazi Germany. The lesson was NOT that Jews need their own homeland. The lesson was that nationalism of any stripe is unconscious and destructive to minorities.
</p>

<p>
	Einstein understood all this. Netanyahu, Evangelicals, and their supporters do not. This is the difference between Spiral Dynamics stage Blue & Green. Orthodox Jews are Blue. Einstein was Green.
</p>

<p>
	To be fair, there are many stage Green progressive Jews in Israel and the US. But just like in the US, demagogues like Trump tend to drown out the voices of reason, consciousness, love, and moderation.
</p>

<p>
	The big picture is this: all limited identities create problems. Just to think of oneself as a "Jew" is already a problem because it is untrue. No one is actually a Jew, they merely imagine they are. They have constructed an identity out of it. Because this identity is fundamentally false, it must be defended to the death and truth must be suppressed. Right wing nationalist Jew like Netanyahu and his ilk are busy defending an false identity, which is why they can be so vicious. This is the fundamental problem with all forms of nationalism. Your true identity is oneness with all living beings. You are God imagining he is a Jew.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that no one wants to help you. It's that no one can help you find Absolute Truth because Absolute Truth is singular.

<p>
	I think there are serious limits for human beings, yes.
</p>

<p>
	I have yet to see a guru sprout wings and fly off into the sunset. Until I see that, I will assume there are serious limits.
</p>

<p>
	But there are no limits for God proper. Since of course God invented all the birds.
</p>

<p>
	This problem arises simply due to a natural conflict of being a thing. To be a thing one must be that thing to the exclusion of other things. To be a human means that you are not a bird, and vice versa. The mistake people make is that they overlook the self-imposed limits of God's design. If God decides to create a dog, you cannot then say, "But why can't God also give it wings?" Because a dog is not supposed to have wings! Such thinking is the ego-mind's silly fantasies. The dog is God, but that does not mean that a dog has the power to grow wings at will. Even though God does have that power. A dog is God in a very specific, limited form, so it is bounded by that form. If God wishes to be unbounded, then it will cease being a dog. But then you will not be able to see it or interact with it in any way. Interaction requires form requires limitation.
</p>

<p>
	The reason the Godhead is so hard to find is because it is everywhere and nowhere. So you cannot pinpoint it.
</p>

<p>
	Many people have reported visiting hell realms. So the historical evidence contradicts your ideas of what is possible.
</p>

<p>
	To say that people have nightmares is not fear-mongering. It's just the case.
</p>

<p>
	David Hawkins vividly describes his visitations to literal hell realms. Check out his videos of it.

<p>
	There is no distinction between any realms and imagination.
</p>

<p>
	I am not just talking about concept. I mean that all physical objects are also imagination, just a deeper level of it. Levels you are not conscious of yet.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you are not yet conscious of how you imagine physical objects. But you do.

Surely this contradicts your earlier statement that devotion can’t lead to enlightenment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Sure that can happen.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying devotion cannot lead to enlightenment. I'm saying it's a very problematic path in practice.
</p>

<p>
	How many Muslims are deluded more than enlightened? 99.99999% of them.
</p>

<p>
	The point is you can turn any object into an object of devotion. If you wanted you could buy a pet goat and imagine that it is God, make it your guru, kiss its feet 5 times a day, have sex with it, and eventually merge with it and become enlightened through it. That goat is as much God as Muhammad, Sadhguru, or anything else.
</p>

<p>
	You are the one imagining this whole game. So you can create whatever spiritual path you like. If you tell yourself you need a guru, that will be true for you.

</p>

<p>
	I mean literal hell realms with devils and fire and horror. The stuff of horror movies. You can dream it up. What do you think a horror movie is? Some twisted mind had to dream that shit up.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being stuck in a horror movie.

<p>
	You (as God) can dream up whatever realm you want.
</p>

<p>
	If the mind is impure it will dream up hell realms. No different than nightmares.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are conscious and pure enough you will not have nightmares any more because you will fear nothing.

<p>
	You are imagining Sadhguru. Don't ever forget that.
</p>

<p>
	The point of Sadhguru is to get you to realize that. Everything else is distraction.
</p>

<p>
	You are also imagining psychedelics. Psychedelics do not actually exist outside of your imagination of them.
</p>

<p>
	The point of taking psychedelics is to realize that you only imagined having taken them <img alt="O.o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/blink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/blink@2x.png 2x" title="O.o" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	When you can no longer distinguish between psychedelics, fantasy, hallucination, and physical reality, then you've learned the most important lesson.

<p>
	In that case maybe you should take on OJ Simpson as your guru.

<p>
	Look at the mental gymnastics people here go through to preserve the myth that enlightenment can only come by following a guru.

<title>Jesus Not Human?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The key point on this topic is this:
</p>

<p>
	Everyone just assumes that Jesus was human. Notice that this is purely an assumption. There is no evidence for it. It is possible that he was not human. Which might explain a lot.
</p>

<p>
	Things could be more complicated than people assume.
</p>

<p>
	The point is not to have some definitive answer, but to question your own paradigms. You never know what amazing discoveries that could lead to. This is the essence of inquiry and science. You question and consider various ways of interpreting the world around you without getting dogmatic about it.
</p>

<p>
	You confuse tradition with some deeper reality.

<p>
	The context of this conversation is not every day common life but the highest levels of consciousness and Absolute Truth. The ultimate truth is that suffering is a distinction created by the mind for survival purposes. But this will not help a person who is not highly conscious. It does no good telling a child who lost his mother than his mother was just something he imagined, even though that is 100% true!
</p>

<p>
	Truth is a radical thing. You can imagine whatever horror stories you want but it does not change the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	"Real" vs imaginary is a duality you are creating. It does no good to believe it, you must be actually conscious that this is so. If you are not conscious of it, it will not help you.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is extremely painful does not make it any less imaginary. Do not confuse pain as evidence of "reality."
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality/God is not a confirmation bias or a mental projection.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelic effects are very consistent as the science shows.

<p>
	Be careful not to get lost in forms and imagery.
</p>

<p>
	All of that imagery is your own imagination.
</p>

<p>
	God is YOU! Don't overlook that.
</p>

<p>
	It takes more trips to realize it.

			Very interesting insight. Seems like DMT is be all and end all for you.
		</p>

		<p>
			But by your Logic nobody in India had reached the peak you claim DMT provides. Every enlightened person from India had a Guru. (havent found a single one yet that didnt).
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	By your logic no one could ever become enlightened since he would need a guru, and his guru would need a guru, and so on, to infinity. How did the very first guru become enlightened? Obviously he had no guru.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously it's possible to become enlightened without a guru. And the most advanced people become enlightened on their own.
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha was not following any guru. There are many examples in history of people doing it on their own.
</p>

<p>
	It's also important to distinguish simply learning or getting advice from a teaching and devoting your life to following a guru. These are very different things. What I was talking about is devoting your life to a guru as a path to awakening. This is a poor path in my opinion. Getting advice from gurus is not a problem. The problem is when you start to expect the guru to be your actual vehicle to awakening. In that case you are using the guru exactly as one would use a psychedelic. Instead of a chemical guru you've found a human meat flesh guru.

<p>
	No, exceptional people have done it and can do it. But the average person cannot.
</p>

<p>
	You have to distinguish between freaks of nature and average people. Let's not pretend that everyone is like Sadhguru or the Buddha in their capabilities.
</p>

<p>
	My advice is for average people, not supernatural freaks (who don't need any advice).

</blockquote>

<p>
	He was a freak. Don't compare average spiritual students to him.
</p>

<p>
	If you are like Ramana Maharshi, you don't need 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	But for the rest of us, there is 5-MeO-DMT to help speed up the way.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're saying that just because some radical guy climbed Everest on his hands and feet that nobody needs helicopters or airplanes. Average people need assistance. A handful of freaks do not.

<p>
	You assume something other than imagination is possible. Well, you're imagining that! Imagination has no opposite since any opposite would itself be imaginary.

</blockquote>

<p>
	We have zero evidence that people have become as conscious via a human guru as a 5-MeO-DMT peak.
</p>

<p>
	I highly doubt it.
</p>

<p>
	People who follow and depend upon human gurus, in my experience, are not very conscious at all. Which is precisely why they worship the guru. They are not conscious enough to realize that their guru is purely their own imagination at work. If they realized that, they'd stop worshiping the guru.
</p>

<p>
	What I'm saying is, anyone who claims to be enlightened, I don't trust that they have gone all the way. They have some degree of realization, but probably not a very deep one. And if they follow any guru, I certainly don't trust them.
</p>

<p>
	Which is not to say the guru is bad or wrong. It's just not an effective method of being highly conscious. People do it because they have not other options, no other tools. If they had 5-MeO-DMT they would realize the foolishness of following another human being or listening to any verbal teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Verbal teachings are garbage, and even practices are too weak. And even the guru's shaktipat will be too weak to reach the levels of consciousness I am talking about. Those are only good when you have nothing better.
</p>

	Suffering and pain are of course imaginary. You are imagining the distinction between pleasure and pain.

	It takes enormous consciousness to be aware of this because pain is most directly related to ego and survival. Do not underestimate the power of survival. It is second only to Truth.

<p>
	Funny how Sadhguru has no problem riding a sports car, motorcycle, airplane, or helicopter rather than using his legs, but then has a problem with using technology to travel within one's own mind.
</p>

<p>
	That's a rather materialistic view of technology.
</p>

<p>
	If he is such an inner engineer, why neglect the most powerful inner engineering tools?
</p>

<p>
	None of his programs will change you as much as a few psychedelic trips will.
</p>

<p>
	The most powerful technology is spiritual technology. The most advanced guru is psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	You will never meet a human guru more powerful than 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>
	IPEC, the coach training program I completed has a Myers-Briggs-like assessment for gauging a person's level of consciousness. It's quite good but they charge money to take it. That's just one example.
</p>

<p>
	It's not hard to design a questionnaire which will assess a person's level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Here are a few same questions:
</p>

<p>
	On a scale of 1 to 5, rate how much you agree or disagree with the following statements:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Nothing is bad in the world. The world is perfect exactly as it is.
	</li>
	<li>
		I am able to give love freely to all living beings.
	</li>
	<li>
		Fear is an illusion.
	</li>
	<li>
		All living beings are interconnected.
	</li>
	<li>
		Science is a partial, narrow, relative way of understanding the world.
	</li>
	<li>
		If the body is destroyed, my true self will not be harmed.
	</li>
	<li>
		Morality is a relative human invention.
	</li>
	<li>
		Every religion is part true, and part false.
	</li>
	<li>
		I am responsible for creating my emotions.
	</li>
	<li>
		All evil is done out of lack of consciousness & ignorance.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	An unconscious person will not be able to strongly agree to any of the above statements because their ego is too insecure and because their everyday experience does not demonstrate the above truths.
</p>

<p>
	To an unconscious person the above questionnaire will appear stupid, childish, hopelessly unrealistic, and even delusional. Which precisely tells you their level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	That 1/4 tsp you mention is not used for measuring the substance, it's merely used as a mixing container. Such a sized spoon is big enough to mix basically any dose of psychedelic that is safe to consume.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	When you suck up the substance + water mixture from the spoon using the syringe, the suction will pull up all particles of matter, even if its not fully dissolved. Of course a few particles tend to remain on the very bottom of the spoon. But you can even suck those up by adding a couple more drops of water after your first suction, and doing a second smaller suction. If done carefully, that second suction should ensure that you get 98%+ of the substance into the syringe.
</p>

<p>
	Use the microscoop to stir the substance into the water.

<p>
	Consciousness is fundamental. You cannot measure it because it is the means by which all measurement is made.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, consciousness is self-knowing.
</p>

<p>
	But more practically it actually is possible to devise tests for consciousness. Such tests have already been created and they can quickly show you how conscious you are. Of course if you're not very conscious you will reject the test's validity because who wants to admit they are not conscious?

	Legit but you need to have the right expectations.
</p>

<p>
	They will not make you enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	They are nowhere as powerful as psychedelics or a hardcore meditative or yogic practice.
</p>

<p>
	I consider them good training wheels for newbies.

<p>
	One of biggest drawbacks is that it can make you lazy, isolated, and spoiled.
</p>

<p>
	Most people need some degree of external pressure to keep them straight, otherwise they would become spoiled and lost in themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Not being accountable to anyone is not all sweetness. Because then you have to hold yourself to account, which is quite the challange.

<p>
	It wasn't a discussion of Vedanta, it was framed as a nonduality war and devolved into that.
</p>

<p>
	Threads which split hairs over unspeakable truths are not helpful, they just get folks riled up and defensive as folks talk past one another.
</p>

<p>
	5 blind men and the elephant syndrome.
</p>

<p>
	It's literally a debate about nothing.

			But even if you become deeply enlightened, let's say like Ralston. Why can't you get access to do the creation aspect of God? Like materializing things through will, you think? Or you probably can, but do you think that is on the deepest levels of enlightenment? 
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Firstly, you DO get some access. You have some access to it even now. You've been using God's creative aspect your whole life. What do you think your mind is? Don't take your mind for granted. It is a powerful creative force.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, there are still limits because that's what it means to be human. You cannot just grow wings and fly off into the sunset. Because God has imagined a rule-bound world. That is what your current state of consciousness entails. If you were to radically change your state you could grow wings and fly away. Which you can do in your dreams, for example. But you tell yourself that that doesn't count. Well, that's your mistake right there. You are imagining that dreams and reality are two different things. They aren't. They are just different states of consciousness.

<p>
	You could not stay alive long at such levels of consciousness. It is not practical because you do not care what happens to your body.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason humans have very limited levels of consciousness: it's not so practical otherwise. You could not accomplish work or raise a family and thus the species would go extinct.
</p>

<p>
	To live as a human is to be in a limited state. Human = limit. Unlimited is what you are when you stop being human.

<p>
	Yang is popular amoung young naive tech savvy stage Orange males.
</p>

<p>
	It's technophile pipedreams.
</p>

<p>
	It would be like if Elon Musk ran for president. His fanboys would be all over it, but they would not understand that Musk is not so advanced politically.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse tech stuff with serious reform of society.
</p>

<p>
	The Yang Gang is not stage Yellow, it's Orange. So watch out.
</p>

<p>
	Yang pushes all the right buttons of tech savvy stage Orange males. Notice that. That's why they like him so much. It's an unconscious response, not careful critical thinking.

<title>How important is it to be a part of a hierarchy?</title>

<p>
	You're not getting it.
</p>

<p>
	MONEY is the hierarchy!
</p>

<p>
	Money means nothing without a hierarchy of wage slaves who will work for you to get your money.
</p>

<p>
	There is no escaping society other than through death.
</p>

<p>
	You can live alone in the woods but you will still be intimately tied into society regardless of how much money you have.
</p>

<p>
	If you watch Life Below Zero you see just how badly people who live alone in the remote Alaskan wilderness depend on society to save their ass. They could not live otherwise.

</p>

<p>
	You can't have it both ways: you can't stay yourself and radically change. It's one or the other. Being you means not being something else. And you are deeply committed to being you. You are not just a blank slate. Your biology has certain trade-offs. You can't just turn yourself into a kangaroo because then you would no longer be a human. By being born as a human you already made the choice to not be a kangaroo. That's what human birth is! That choice! So now you're stuck with it until you completely relinquish that choice (via "death").

Although 40mg is a strong trip for me. So don't get cocky.

You could hallucinate a person, have a conversation with him for 2 hours, only later to realize that he was just your own imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Datura is lethal so don't ever try it. But it's important to understand that such things are possible because physical reality is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	If you've taken high doses of psychedelics you have first hand experience of how your imagination can become reality.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't happen in conventional states of consciousness because it interferes with your survival.

<p>
	Stop assuming that the drug regulators are looking out for you. They looking out for their wallets and egos.

	If 5-MeO ever became legal the world would change more radically than from the internet.

<p>
	Of course microscoop measurements are all relative per substance.
</p>

<p>
	What you do is start with a 1 scoop dose. See how that feels for you, then bump it up to 1.5 or 2 scoops next time.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this has to be done each time anew for each new substance.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are familiar with your substance, counting in terms of scoops rather than milligrams becomes easy and accurate.
</p>

<p>
	There are few substances that I have heard of where one 10mg microscoop will be way too much. Especially if you're plugging it.
</p>

<p>
	I have found milligram scales to be not sensitive enough. I can throw 10mg on the scale, then double that dose and it will still say 10mgs!
</p>

	A $1 dollar microscoop is easier and dare I say even more accurate.

<p>
	What I say does not contradict what you say.
</p>

<p>
	God is all form, and if all form disappears, God is the emptiness that remains. There is only one thing: God. It can take many forms or no form at all, and there is no difference between form and not-form unless you hold that there is.
</p>

<p>
	Way too much hairsplitting going on in this thread. It's a discussion about nothing.

EVERYTHING is Brahman. Your nonduality is incomplete.
</p>

<p>
	If you have 2 things, that is duality!
</p>

<p>
	The distinction between Brahman and world is something Brahman (You) is imagining.
</p>

<p>
	All difference is God's imagination at work. So if you see a difference between things, you can be sure that you created that difference.
</p>

<p>
	It would be wise of you guys to listen to what is being said here.

<p>
	This will not fly at all.
</p>

<p>
	You need TOTAL superhuman focus to breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	You have not even begun the work yet. You are kidding yourself still.
</p>

<p>
	You can keep doing passive inquiry for 1000 years and not awaken. So be very realistic with yourself about how you are wasting your time. You have to be brutally honest with yourself about distrations.
</p>

<p>
	Make a clear distinct between when you are seriously inquiring vs just screwing around.

<p>
	We don't practice the occult here.
</p>

<p>
	Your real work should be to move on from Chris, let him be, and do consciousness work on yourself until you realize that death is an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Communicating with the dead is not going to resolve your fundamental life issues. This takes some wisdom to see.

In the end you should be much more functional by being conscious.
</p>

<p>
	Of course shutting off the mind disrupts a lot of egoic survival schemes, goals, motivations, and manipulations.
</p>

<p>
	You're not realizing yet that the goal of spirituality is surrender of all reality and practicality. You cannot be liberated so long as you're worried about being practical.
</p>

<p>
	After awakening you can pick some of that practicality back up, but while you are working towards awakening the point is to surrender more and more of it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this interferes with becoming successful. But the point is that success is a never-ending cycle of suffering.
</p>

<p>
	But there's also nothing wrong with working on success if you feel you need to. Remember, plan out your life in chapters and phases. If you're young you might want to spend 5 or 10 years working on success before you go heavy into awakening work.
</p>

<p>
	So get clear about what you want and then pursue that decisively.

</p>

<p>
	That line of reasoning is precisely how the ego maintains itself. You must challenge that if you wish to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	The selfish one is you. You are so selfish you cannot even see your own reasoning as devilry.

It just seems it has no practical side to it other than giving you new beliefs (but at least it comes from your direct experience..). </span>

	The point is immortality. Very practical to understand that birth and death and suffering are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, practicality is imaginary too.

<p>
	Yes, you are imagining all of that.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds incredible because you actually believe there is something called "reality". There is not. There is only the reality you imagine.

<p>
	Only because you have barely started the process of awakening. It goes far beyond anything you can imagine. All of reality will collapse if you go deep enough. But you are too scared to go that deep. You are not willing to surrender your whole life yet.
