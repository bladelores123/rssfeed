Pretend like you are trying to fog up a mirror with your breath. But then close your mouth, letting the air go out through the nose.
</p>

<p>
	Experiment with various degrees of constriction of the throat until you get a nice sound going and it feels solid.
</p>

<p>
	Your throat needs to constrict almost as much as possible in order to slow down the air as much as possible, so you can do long slow breaths.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like sucking in air through a straw. But you are using your throat as the straw.
</p>

	They are worse than traditional religion. They are a legit cult. They will psychologically manipulate and exploit you.

<p>
	I will talk about the dangers of cults and how they work in the future.

</p>

<p>
	How do you make it stick? By doing lots of practices like self-inquiry until your entire reality is deconstructed.

</p>

<p>
	So how do you go about talking about such things to people who have not experienced them?
</p>

<p>
	Here we are.
</p>

<p>
	If we didn't call it nonduality what would be call it? How would we let you know this thing exists?
</p>

<p>
	Maybe we should call it "chicken" from now on and see if that solves the problem.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way to get around the fact that incommunicable things exist. You can try for a million years and you will never solve this problem. Because an unspeakable thing cannot be spoken, by definition.

			You missed the part they cut out where he said "I'm not saying you shouldn't wear make-up". "I'm saying we don't know what the rules are.". Can people be manipulated? What's Vice's reasoning for cutting that out? Literally cut right before he says that.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's just a clever rhetorical trick. He plays this trick a lot. He implies a conservative position but then he never commits to it outright because it would sound ridiculous even to him.
</p>

<p>
	He DID seriously consider the possibilty that women should not wear make up.
</p>

<p>
	He is in the business of playing ideological mind games, not actually offering practical solutions.
</p>

<p>
	He did the same thing with his enforced "enforced monogamy" comment.
</p>

<p>
	JP's whole game is to say deliberately controversial and backwards things, and then dial it back to something half-reasonable. This gets him all of this clicks and views.
</p>

<p>
	The rules are whatever we want them to be. They can be very simple: don't slap a woman's ass and be more sensitive to her POV as a man. Don't abuse a position of power to coerce women to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	But this would require admitting that feminism has validity. Which he does not want to do.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	1) Try a psychedelic and you will immediately understand. This is not possible to understand conceptually. You must experience it.
</p>

<p>
	2) Hmmm... that's a bit tricky because all of those things are conceptual. What you can see is how your mind constructs those things. You can see the metaphysical and epistemic substrate of those things.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics certainly make you 100x more creative. But it will not necessarily be productive in the way your ego-mind wants. It will be far more profound than that.
</p>

<p>
	You basically will not care about science and math at this level of depth. They will seem shallow and insignificant compared to metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	During one of my solo retreats I did randomly invent a cool new patentable invention. No psychedelics were used. Just lots of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become the more creative you become.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The solution to sexual harassement in the workplace is to forbid women from wearing makeup?
</p>

<p>
	That is what JP is basically saying.
</p>

<p>
	It is simply unworkable and it will not stop sexual harassement.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to workplace harassement is cultural. It requires evolving the workplace culture from Orange to Green. But JP demonizes Green so he is unable to see the solution. Precisely because his ego does not want a Green culture.
</p>

<p>
	JP's mission in life is to prevent an evolution of culture into stage Green.
</p>

<p>
	You see the problem with this and why liberals are so opposed to him?
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't mean Green culture is free of problems. But it is surely healthier than Orange culture. And it would reduce sexual harassment.
</p>

<p>
	The MeToo movement is not a mistake. It is a net positive for society despite a few cases of overcorrection. In the end, after all the dust settles, your daughters will better off. And you will embrace it as the obvious solution.
</p>

So there is some truth to what he's saying then. It is typical though, corporations don't want their employees to look like dirt.

<p>
	Culturally, a woman's value is highly contingent on her physical appearance.
</p>

<p>
	This goes way deeper than sexual lust.
</p>

<p>
	If your value was based highly on physical appearance, you would do everything you could to maximize that. Not because you want sex, but because you want to be accepted and valued by your tribe.
</p>

<p>
	A woman who shows up to a job interview without makeup will not be hired. Think about that!
</p>

<p>
	It's really not much different if a man showed up to a job interview without combing his hair, shaving his stubble, and ironing his shirt.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone on TV, men and women, wear makeup for this reason.
</p>

<p>
	Every time I shoot a video I spend about 20 minutes making myself look pretty, so you guys aren't disgusted watching my face. That's showbiz. That doesn't mean I want you to slap my ass or fondle my tits if you see me out in public.

</p>

<p>
	You know, right, that most retail shops will not even allow a woman employee to show up to work without makeup? Because it would turn the customers off.
</p>

<p>
	Make up is a cultural necessity for women.
</p>

<p>
	This is just a rehash of the old "You got raped because you were asking for it" excuse. That's how stage Blue thinks about female empowerment/liberation. It's not the responsibility of the man to control himself. So if harassment happens its the woman's fault for being overly sexual.
</p>

<p>
	This exact logic was used in the 1950's to keep women from wearing shorts & skirts.
</p>

<p>
	This ain't science bro. This is an ego-mind using science to convince itself of the validity of its crumbling conservative worldview.

<p>
	Think of it this way: In Saudi Arabia JP's logic can be used to keep women from driving cars, wearing shorts, or owning bank accounts.

	If you really wanted to, you could. The problem is you don't want to. You're lacking the vision, the ambition.
</p>

<p>
	Changing your situation will require lots of hustle for a few years at least. But don't look of that as a negative, it's a positive. For once you will be doing something exciting with your life. That excitement leads to passion and the feeling of "being alive".

<title>I-AM-ness &amp; the Sponge analogy</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/27604-i-am-ness-the-sponge-analogy/?do=findComment&amp;comment=317706</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12784-graded24/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="12784" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12784-graded24/" rel="">@graded24</a>
</p>

<p>
	1) I-AM-ness is nothing. Which is why the mind cannot grasp it. Yes, I-AM-ness is awareness. Nothingness is self-aware. But don't think of awareness as a thing or a substance. It is nothing. The reason you struggle to get this is because you assume that nothing cannot be self-aware. This is a false assumption.
</p>

<p>
	2) There is only one "substance" in reality, period. That substance is nothing. Everything is it. No exceptions. Everything is self-aware because it is nothing. The entire sponge is nothing. The sponge is not distinct from the empty space it occupies. This cannot really be conveyed by the analogy because it would require you to already have nondual awareness. You see the sponge as distinct from the empty space because you're looking at it dualistically. If you were awake, you'd realize the sponge is nothing, as are all physical objects. This does not mean that sponge disappears or changes shape or color. It just means that you realize that shapes and colors ARE nothing.
</p>

<p>
	3) Again, you are making the mistake of thinking of nothing as the opposite of something. This is the ultimate duality. You're expecting nothing to be a blank -- the opposite of something. And it is that. But it is also all the non-blank stuff as well! Form and formlessness are actually identical. This won't make much sense without a deep awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You have to deeply question all dualities like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Something vs nothing
	</li>
	<li>
		Form vs formlessness
	</li>
	<li>
		Dual vs nondual
	</li>
	<li>
		Me vs you
	</li>
	<li>
		Inner vs outer
	</li>
	<li>
		God vs not-God
	</li>
	<li>
		Life vs death
	</li>
	<li>
		Existence vs non-existence
	</li>
	<li>
		Awareness vs non-awareness
	</li>
	<li>
		Material vs immaterial
	</li>
	<li>
		Mind vs body
	</li>
	<li>
		Self vs world
	</li>
	<li>
		Good vs bad
	</li>
	<li>
		Sentient vs non-sentient
	</li>
	<li>
		Life vs non-life
	</li>
	<li>
		Matter vs empty space
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	All of those distinctions will ultimately collapse into unity if you question them deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you've experienced in your entire life was nothing. It's like the entire universe never even happened.
</p>

<p>
	In the beginning, there was nothing. The end. It's like the universe was never even born.
</p>

<p>
	This is an utterly shocking realization which requires super-human levels of consciousness to realize. If you ever get this far, it's as though you broke all of existence. And then again, this is already true right this second in your experience. You just overlooking the obvious.
</p>

	Secondly, the concept of rationality depends on a duality created by the rationalist which carves up the world into rational vs its opposite. So by the very logic of the rationalist, to say something is rational is to say something else is not, which be definition means the world contains both rational and not rational things. Which means the world is not rational. If everything in the universe was rational the label "rational" would cease to have any meaning. The only value this label has is precisely because there are irrational things afoot which you wish to distinguish from the rational things.
</p>

<p>
	Rationality is a self-defeating category. As all categories are. Because they are projections of the human mind.
</p>

<p>
	Calling reality rational is as silly as calling reality "sexual" just because you like sex. Some stuff is sexual, but most stuff is not. Likewise with the rationality label. Reality contains sex but it is not limited to sex. Sex does not even account for 1% of reality, neither does rationality.

You're the one coming up with theories here. And all theories miss the mark.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is not a theory.
</p>

<p>
	What matter is if you are lost in the mind or awake.
</p>

<p>
	At this point you are still deeply stuck in your own mind. This results in living a deluded life, full of discontent and suffering. When you get tired of your mind games, come on back and we can show you how to awaken.

<p>
	Sorry to hear that. Our society is not really designed to treat these kinds of edge cases.
</p>

<p>
	The advice is: take full ownership of your life. Do not expect anyone else to solve your emotional or psychological issues for you. Get a journal and start working it out yourself. Start doing research, start reading books, start watching videos. Become the expert on your condition and cure yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you got more fundamental issues to resolve before you worry about meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Find a way to ease off the drugs if it is safe to do so.
</p>

<p>
	You can solve this. It will just take some work.
</p>

	The universe is perfect only once the "you" is gone. So long as there's a "you", it will bitch and moan about things not going its way.

<p>
	Extinction of humans would be a great thing for many other creatures.
</p>

<p>
	If humans go extinct it will be because that is what is best to raise the overall consciousness of the universe. So it's all good in the end.

</p>

<p>
	Just because the ears cannot hear the color red, you don't hold that against them, so why are you holding it against thoughts that they cannot see red? Each sense has its own unique qualities which the others do not. And so what?
</p>

<p>
	Try a psychedelic and you will realize that it is possible to think infinite thoughts which break all conventional linear logical molds.

<p>
	I don't know why you are so attached to this idea that the mind cannot contain/create new information. This is just silly.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it is true that the mind commonly rehashes a lot for information that was fed into it, but this is not some physical law. The mind also produces original insights, images, and ideas.
</p>

<p>
	All of these notions that you appeal to so loosely such "mind", "thoughts", "information" are very tricky and nuanced things. You don't actually yet know what these things are or how they work.

<p>
	The distinction between internal/external that you are making is itself a self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	There certainly is no such thing as a "real world". That is a fantasy occuring in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	You see how sneaky the mind is? Your attempt to refute self-deception has itself become a self-deception. Thus proving my point.

</p>

<p>
	The universe is so intelligent that it figured out a way to design itself down the very last molecule.
</p>

<p>
	You can see a bit of this in action if you observe how your own mind works. The mind does not randomly string together permuations of words and ideas. The mind intelligently selects each thought so it makes maximum sense. This is the universe in action. The universe is thinking your thoughts for you. How? That is the wonder of it! It's astounding.

	This cannot be understood in your present state of consciousnsess -- like, at all. It doesn't make sense to the linear logical mind. There is little sense trying to think this through. You must do intense practices or psychedelics to get it.

<p>
	That's begging the question. You're already assuming in that case that you are the thing being hit. Why do you assume you are a body? Just because pain happens does not mean it is you. What if you are a thing which cannot feel pain but mistook yourself for a thing that can? How would you know?
</p>

<p>
	Question the basics of your metaphysics.

	Those are called Kriyas.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter. The body/mind bio-machine is just rewiring itself and working stuff out. Let it happen naturally, don't cling to it, don't get wowed or distracted by it, and carry on with your practices with your eye on the ball: Truth/Enlightenment
</p>

<p>
	Basically, no matter what happens during spiritual practice you just keep doing the practice. Unless it gets so bad that you cannot function, then you can ease up on the practice for a bit, but then get back into it. There are lots of potential side effects and none of them really matter other than as signs that you are growing.

<title>Using Ayauasca to prepare for first 5-Meo experience?</title>

</p>

<p>
	You're overthinking it. Stop listening to all the stories you've heard about 5-MeO and just go based on your direct experience. If you haven't tried it you have no idea what it will do and nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is quite beautiful, peaceful, benevolent, and straight-forward as far as psychedelics go. At least for me. For me it has the least potential for weird, twisted trips. It's just a pure increase in consciousness. No funny business.
</p>

<p>
	If you can handle Ayahausca you can handle 5-MeO.
</p>

			I've thought about quite a bit myself. I often hear awakened beings say things like nonduality cannot be explained, only pointed to. I acknowledge that has been true for thousands of years - yet I question whether that is an assumption. What if in 200 years all beings are in nondual states? It was not a mindset people had to work years and years to reach. People are born and raised into it. If that was "normal" would not a method of communication arise? Perhaps hyper-intuition would serve as a "language".

<p>
	No! All communication is dualistic.

<p>
	It is an idea but it is also a state of consciousness. Which is why it's so difficult to drop. It doesn't really go away even if you stop thinking for a few minutes. Because there is an entire egoic state of consciousness which makes it feel as though you are real.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of deconstructing and focused concentration to break down that egoic state of consciousness.

<p>
	Enlightenment is most important for me. But that's me and I already resolved my life purpose a long ago.

<p>
	For some people, paying their mortgage is most important.

That would be the ultimate integration.
</p>

<p>
	Take smaller doses and don't lay down or close your eyes during trips and you should see it.

<p>
	Try contemplating: What is form? while you do this.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You need to distinguish awakening itself from changes to one's sensory field. Psychedelics tend to alter the sensory field a lot as well as produce awakening. It is possible to awaken without any change to the sensory field at all. And this is usually the case in non-psychedelic awakening. Or it's possible to have radical changes to the sensory field, such as the entire sensory field disappearing or morphing into fractals and all sorts of other stuff like a DMT alien hyperspace landscape.
</p>

<p>
	If you are in pure void with no sensory field at all, then that would be pure void. Obviously there's nothing there. No perceptions, no forms at all. Like deep sleep. Obviously there are no colors and shapes in deep sleep.
</p>

<p>
	BUT! That is not strictly necessary for awakening. You can awaken without your sensory field changing at all. In fact, you can realize that "the void" is ALWAYS the case! Even when the sensory field is fully here, it is still void. The sensory field is not other than void.
</p>

<p>
	All of these possibilities are possible with or without psychedelics. But with psychedelics you are much more likely to get radical alterations of the sensory field.
</p>

<p>
	There is no perceiver. The perceiver would be the ego or sense of self or "you", which does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	Perceptions exist in an empty vacuum or void. This void is the "True Self" or God. This void is not seperate from the perceptions themselves. Perception ARE the void! Which is just another way of saying that perceptions happen to no one.
</p>

<p>
	God is no one.
</p>

<p>
	The feeling that there is a perciever is the chief delusion that must be deconstructed.

<p>
	There is a causal strange loop relationship between sense organs and perceptions. Sense organs are themselves perceptions which have a global affect on other perceptions. If you lose an eye, your perceptions will never be the same.
</p>

<p>
	No self and universal Self are identical.
</p>

<p>
	Appearances don't need to dissolve. Appearances are already nothing. Nothing is not merely an empty space. It is that, but it is also all matter, form, shape, color, etc. The very room you are sitting in is what Nothing looks like! Nonduality means that the distinction between something and nothing is relative and must ultimately collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the bubble dissolves in deep sleep but you currently lack the consciousness necessary to know the deep sleep state. After a deep awakening you can be conscious even during deep sleep. It will be a consciousness of formless infinity.
</p>

<p>
	I explained intelligence in the What Is Intelligence video. Intelligence is an aspect of consciousness. The universe has infinite intelligence, which it used to design itself.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	What you presently think of as "bad luck" is actually likely the result of egoic ways in which you live your life. Which can be changed.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is NOT an accident. There is a big component of it which is self-inflicted. So starting thinking about how to change your ways to align more with truth, goodness, love, and selflessness.

<p>
	Nonduality includes duality within it. Therein lies the full circle.

<p>
	That's one good way.
</p>

<p>
	But there are many ways!
</p>

<p>
	Like the Shamanic Breathing technique I shared in the Shamanic Breathing video.
</p>

<p>
	Or the yoga I shared in the The Important Of Real Yoga video.
</p>

<p>
	Or psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	I've shared dozens of the best techniques with you.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the most powerful technique ever if you use them right. You could use them to deprogram all your viruses over time.
</p>

<p>
	All of the questions being asked in this thread could be answered with a couple of solid psychedelic trips. During a psychedelic trip you can literally communicate with the universe and ask it any questions you want, and you will get more reliable answers then from the best human gurus, because a human guru can only talk, not show you. A psychedelic can actually modify your field of consciousness to show you the answer.

	Think of the mind like a computer hard drive. The hard drive can get loaded with all sorts of viruses and bad programs which then need to be uninstalled and defragmented. That is the function of therapeutic and self-help techniques. They make the computer run smoother.

<p>
	Obviously a computer doesn't need to have an "I" for this to happen. Neither does your brain/mind.

<p>
	It's a real thing and you can do it if you want. But if you do it in a repressive, neurotic, or egoic way, it will backfire on you.
</p>

<p>
	Sexual desires must be genuinely transcended through spiritual work. You cannot just suppress or deny them mechanically without expecting problems. Which is why many of these no-fap people and Catholic priests suffer & struggle so much. They are doing it dogmatically.

	You're conflating types with stages.

<p>
	Regardless of your type (Myers-Briggs, Enneagram, masculine/feminine, etc) you can be at various stages of Spiral development.
</p>

<p>
	You can be a 5 Blue, 5 Orange, 5 Green, 5 Yellow, 5 Turquoise just like you can be a feminine Blue, feminine Orange, feminine Green, feminine Yellow, feminine Turquoise.

	The bottom line is, you will not have the perserverence to master a thing unless you enjoy doing it. There has to be an underlying love/passion/fascination. It just isn't always glaring when you start.

<p>
	Of course you only came into existence about 2-3 years after the birth of that thing you call a body.
</p>

<p>
	But still, it is possible to recall memories prior to the ego's creation. There are techniques for recalling memories when "your" body was in "your" mother's womb.
</p>

<p>
	Memory is an independent variable from ego.
</p>

<p>
	The brain struggles to recall memories before 3 years of age. They are still there, but just very difficult to access. Shamanic breathing can help you access them.
</p>

<p>
	And this doesn't even get into the whole issue of accessing past lives, which some folks claim is doable.

<p>
	If you notice, dreams commonly reveal your deep-seated fears. Especially if the same dream keeps happening over and over again. This is an opportunity for you to learn your lesson and resolve your fear. Then the dream will stop repeating and you will get more advanced dreams. Keep learning the lesson from each one until eventually you purify yourself of all your fears.

	It's due to the academia part.
</p>

<p>
	Academia has its head up its own ass. To maintain its status as the arbiters of "truth", academia must dismiss everything non-academia as unscientific BS. Which itself is unscientific BS.
</p>

<p>

Pure consciousness is not a thing. It is blank, void, nothing. It is like the hole in your coffee cup. You're asking: "Can a pure hole exist without a coffee cup?" Yes, except it is then no longer a hole as you've always thought of it. It is just infinite emptiness.

<p>
	The Absolute has no qualities, which is identical to it having all qualities.
</p>

<p>
	All qualities are qualities of the Absolute. So literally any quality you can think of is a quality of the Absolute. Which is precisely why nothing can be said of the Absolute because to say it has one quality but not another is to misrepresent it.
</p>

<p>
	It is infinite, finite, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	It is small, big, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	It is eternal, temporal, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	And so on down the line.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind cannot hold all of these qualities at once. For that, you would have to exit the mind and literally become the entire universe. Which is possible, but not within the realm of speech or conventional "knowledge." You'd have to leave those behind.

<p>
	That's gonna be true of most work environments. The search for Truth is the opposite of doing everyday work.
</p>

<p>
	Even the work I do for Actualized.org is counter-productive for seeking Truth. In fact, very much so. Because work is just not about that. Work is a survival function, which is the opposite of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem I see with programming is that it consigns you to sit at a computer terminal for 8 hours per day for 40 years. But then again, lots of work does that these days. I spend much of my time on a computer. So....

</p>

<p>
	I have grown tired of these arrogant enlightened folks coming here and acting like know-it-all jerks.

	So it's nice to hear from someone with humility.

</p>

<p>
	Are you running away from anything in doing this?
</p>

<p>
	How mentally stable are you? Are you depressed or suffering from any kind of mental disorders?
</p>

<p>
	How good are you at tolerating being alone?
</p>

<p>
	Only then is your enlightenment complete.
