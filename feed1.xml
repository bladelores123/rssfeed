<p>
	Things are not just as they are. They are a very specific way, a very deliberate and intelligent way. Everything is intelligible. It is possible to become conscious of why every hair on your arm exists exactly as it does and not otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to understand why the whole universe exists. Profound awakening required of course. This is no ordinary reason. You must penetrate the very structure of God. It has a logic to it.

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with Zen teachings per se, I was just saying that they are minimalist. Minimalism does not make people aware of what they are missing.
</p>

<p>
	How many Zen students really understand the depth of Zen? Virtually none. It requires super-human levels of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha said: no one will understand. And so it is. It's too much.
</p>

It plays coy.
</p>

<p>
	Virtually no one who practices Zen understands how deep consciousness goes or what God is. Only a few of the highest Zen masters do.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Shinzen Young does not understand why reality exists. He's not fully woke and he does not know it. That's with 40 years of professional Zen practice.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, nothing at all against his teachings. I'm just saying there are levels which virtually no one has accessed. I am just using this example to point out how tricky this work is. No one is safe. Proceed with extreme care.
</p>

<p>
	No they aren't.
</p>

<p>
	They are just less corrupted by beliefs and less rigid.
</p>

<p>
	Kids are very selfish and nowhere close to woke. They are like animals. They have no clue they are God.

In it's disguise as the devil God does all sorts of evils. In its pure undisguised from God is pure love and goodness. For God to hate it must incarnate itself as an ego and delude itself into believing it is not God. So when God forgets who it is, it does evil. When God is forced to play the game of survival, it does evil in order to survive.

</blockquote>

<p>
	If you mean Absolute Truth then your contemplations should eventually converge. But even so, there are many facets to Absolute Truth such that even the same person will not reach the same point twice in a row, never mind other people. The trick is that the Absolute is singular, but it can be seen in various light, so to speak, and it will be interpreted very differently by different minds. It's sort of like looking at an object with very little light in the room. The object itself is always the same, but the lighting conditions plus your perspective on that object plus your distance from that object determine what you will see. Someone from 100ft away at night will see something very different than someone 2 inches away in full daylight. And then there's your reactions, opinions, feelings, and judgments about the object. All of that makes it very unlikely that two people understand/see anything the same way, even the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, there should be some rough broad consensus.
</p>

<p>
	As far as relative truths are concerned, the situation there is even worse. The mind will color everything in such a way that your understanding of relative truths will tend to be very different from other people. Because how you see the world is a direct reflection of how you must see it in order to survive. Survival distorts perception enormously. What you see, what you know, and how you understand things is almost totally dominated by your survival needs. Truth is hardly anything your mind cares about. Your mind is 99.9% preoccupied with survival. Which is why there is so much disagreement between people.
</p>

To fully grasp what consciousness is so astounding that it ends you entire old way of life.
</p>

<p>
	When you ask What is consciousness? you are really asking What is the substance of all of existence? That's a monster of a question. It may take you 10-20 years of work to get the answer.
</p>

<p>
	I have a video: What Is Consciousness? Maybe check that out.
</p>

<p>
	In short: consciousness is nothing, consciousness is everything, consciousness is God. But just hearing that as words does very little for you. You must undertake a journey to personally realize what consciousness is. This requires multiple deep enlightenment experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Very simply, to ground your inquiry, pull out your hand right now and hold it close to your face. Look at it closely. Your hand is consciousness. Realize that. And then begin to wonder: What is consciousness? What is it's very essence? Here it is, but WHAT is it?
</p>

<p>
	HINT: Any object you look at is consciousness. There is nothing but consciousness. Consciousness is not a thing, it is a sort of ever-present, self-aware, space.
</p>

<p>
	VERY IMPORTANT: Stop thinking of consciousness is a secretion of the brain or somehow arising out of matter. The brain and matter are both made out of consciousness. Consciousness is prior to physics or physical reality. It is impossible to understand consciousness from within the materialist paradigm.
</p>

		<p>
			When making statements like "Things only happen by God's will." are we not running into the risk of confusing and deluding people due to the stark difference in interpretation between gross, casual, subtle and non-dual state of consciousness, and also due to a difference in cognition from different cognitive stages? 
		</p>

		<p>
			It seems to me like a person only capable of, for example, formal operational thought is actually incapable of correctly interpreting your statement, due to the inherent limitations of his cognition. Statements coming from vision logic or beyond will actually cease to be the same statements when viewed from formal operational cognition. When they read it and they are at that stage, and they agree with you, they are actually wrong about what they agree with you about. And if they do not agree, they are wrong too because they do not even comprehend the true meaning of the statement. Either way they will come out confused, whether they believe you or not.
		</p>

		<p>
			And to me this is a real problem in the spiritual community, especially with non-dual "truths" that are being thrown around like candy, necessarily misinterpreted by those who hear them, as they themselves cannot truly understand the meaning of those truths if they have not reached any non-dual states.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this forum alone I see countless of people who are adopting non-dual, casual, subtle or psychic intellectual positions without having even experienced these states. And furthermore it seems like these statements only make sense while being in the particular state they originated from, which further complicates everything as it can easily lead to self-delusion by the person who has temporarily experienced one of these states.
		</p>

		<p>
			What do we do about this problem? I know your style is not conducive to the zen-master riddle approach, but are you not worried about leading people on the wrong path if you give them higher truths that they are bound to be deluded and misinterpreted? Wouldn't a spiral wizard be a little more sophisticated, by for example luring a person to the next stage instead of going full non-dual on them if they are far removed from that realm?
		</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's basically right. Higher truths/wisdom requires a certain wisdom to understand and interpret properly. Ignorant devils will misinterpret the hell out of all the highest teachings because that's what devils do. Devils turn truth into falsehood. That's the entire function of a devil.
</p>

<p>
	We are sort of damned if we do, and damned if we don't. If we don't talk about God, we are not being honest and people are being mislead. If we do talk about God, we are creating representations of God, all of which are not the actual thing, and people will be mislead. That's the tragedy of our collective situation.
</p>

<p>
	When I speak of God's will, I speak from direct experience. Of course most people have no experience of what God or God's will mean. And any ideas you have about it are wrong. So what are we to do? Direct experience is required to understand the highest teachings.
</p>

<p>
	One of the reasons I'm big on psychedelics is that they give ordinary people such direct experiences very quickly, without decades of grueling practice. So then they can understand me a lot better. You can take a psychedelic and ask it the question, "What is God's will?" or "What is God?" and it will show you the answer very clearly, as long as you are truly open to it and willing to surrender yourself and your beliefs. It might take you a few trips, but you'll get it.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, talking about God to uninformed people is very misleading to them. Because their ideas of God are so confused and backwards. You can really only talk about God to people who have experienced that they are God. Which sort of defeats the point of talking at all. And yet without talking about God how are people gonna find God? Only by accident. Which is not a good solution.

<p>
	The world of form is infinite in all directions. You can study it forever and you will be no closer to the end than when you began.
</p>

<p>
	But as far as understanding the Absolute, you can make some really headway there. You can grasp the nature of reality in one shot, although there are many facets and degrees of depth to it. So even there you can spend a lot of time understanding it deeper and deeper.

<p>
	Sometimes you grow out of your passion onto something new. And sometimes you just need to rekindle your passion because you are doing it too mechanically, too much for external rather than internal reasons.
</p>

<p>
	Taking time to contemplate your life in solititude helps enormously to figure what the problem is.

<p>
	Try not to make a big spectacle of it. Then it won't be so dramatic and scary. With spiritual death you discover that you've jumped off a cliff only to land on the fluffiest feather mattress, so you're not really losing anything. Don't let the ego create a big story about how it's losing so much. You're mostly losing bullshit delusions and gaining peace and authenticity. So it's a good trade.
</p>

<p>
	I've made the mistake in the past of over-dramatizing the ego-death part. Yes it happens but facing death is also not as hard or bad as it sounds. After a couple dozen ego-deaths it becomes natural and not a big deal.

<p>
	The being of this very moment is none other than Absolute Truth, but you are not yet conscious enough to see it as such. Concepts are getting in the way of direct consciousness of being.

	Ta-da!

<p>
	But this will take you some years of hard work to fully realize. So get to work. It's worth it.

	Or maybe everything I said above is false? You don't know. This requires exploration.

</p>

<p>
	You could eat some magic mushrooms and know things which would otherwise be impossible for a human to know. That would be another way.
</p>

<p>
	You don't even know if Kriya yoga will work. Maybe it's a scam as far as you know. See how tricky knowledge is? What do you trust? What is true?
</p>

<p>
	Truth is a highly non-trivial matter. How do you even know what criterion you'll use to determine if a thing is true? What if your criterion is false?
</p>

<p>
	And yet at the same time you also cannot say that all knowledge is false or impossible since that itself would be true knowledge, and you don't actually know that for sure. Such a claim would require that you test every piece of knowledge in the universe to make sure they are all false. You are nowhere close to doing that.
</p>

<p>
	So the bottom line is: keep a very open mind, don't dismiss anything, and run some experiments. Kriya yoga is one such experiment out of hundreds that you will have to run in order to come to know what knowledge is and is not.
</p>

Although violence and disturbance is also an aspect of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There is no "best" really. It depends on your goals. Some people love their suffering and fantasies. Very few people are really ready and willing to awaken from Maya.
</p>

<p>
	Harmony is a tricky thing. Being a total pacificist for example when all your neighbors are wolves will not lead to harmony but your extinction or enslavement.
</p>

<p>
	Violence and peace are both necessary, which is why they co-exist. Violence begets peace, and peace begets violence. It's dialectical.

</p>

<p>
	Be nuanced. Not all beliefs and teachings are wrong or false. You must evaluate them within a certain limited relative context. Stop trying to make everything be absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Teachings have certain pragmatic purposes and also limits. Teachings are partial relative truths. How else could it be?

<p>
	It is not cut in actually, it is cut as an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	If an actor on stage got so wrapped up in playing his character that he forgot for a moment that he was just acting, that's how ignorance comes about.
</p>

<p>
	It is the nature of consciousness to be very hypnotic. It hypnotizes itself into dreamlike states which it then cannot resist.
</p>

<p>
	Ever play a video game and get so immersed in the world that you forget about the "real" world? Well, that's precisely how consciousness works. Appearance becomes reality. For a while. Always only for a while.
</p>

<p>
	Ever jerk off to porn? What is that? You are literally jerking off to an LCD screen! There's your illusion.

I have been studying this question for over 15 years. I have literally poured thousands of hours contemplating this one question because it is so important. On it hinges everything else. If you get this question wrong, you're basically fucked in life.
</p>

<p>
	From your current POV the truth is you don't know what can or cannot be known. You do not even know what knowing is!
</p>

<p>
	This is a great place to start. From this place you can do some serious inquiry. This question is not to be guessed or answered by looking up an answer in a book. You must really go on a journey and explore what knowledge is and how it works.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind that there are different kinds of knowing. Verbal or rational knowing is only one kind. The most advanced things I speak of are knowable, but not from your current state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it is possible to know what God is or why existence exists or what consciousness is. But not through coventional logical verbal knowledge. There is knowing and understanding beyond the human mind.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest insights I share are not just stories or beliefs -- they are transrational understandings.
</p>

<p>
	Consider that there is a very profound connection between knowing and being. Some things can only be known by being them. This is the domain of mysticism and samadhi.
</p>

	Knowledge as a relative thing is good and legit.
</p>

<p>
	Understanding is real and not to be trashed. Without understanding you could not even understand this sentence or awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Be more nuanced. The Absolute and understanding and knowledge can all co-exist. Each has its proper place and role to play. The mistake is to confuse them. The mistake is to not realize their limits. Knowledge simply has limits.

You must exhaust the mind's answers. Purge them. It would be very helpful for you to write down all your theories about what you are, no matter how ridiculous, just to purge them. Write them out, then cross them out and throw them in the trash.
</p>

<p>
	Not knowing is exactly the place you want to get to. The problem is that you still have many ideas and theories about what you are. You haven't purged enough yet to truly not know.
</p>

<p>
	The mind will never grasp it. It must be silenced through this purging method. Then just sit and bask in the silence, and that will be your best chance of enlightenment. It will not happen via your mind. The mind is the only obstacle to enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	A LOT of purging must happen. Way more than you'll be comfortable with. You must even purge things like your childhood memories of yourself, since they are not the True Self.
</p>

<p>
	Since God is Absolute Truth, even a hint of lying, dishonesty, falsehood, or inathenticity automatically severes your connection to God. That is okay. It is not "bad" to be seperated from God, but it painful since you become lost in your own falsehood. That is the definition of devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Lying is only "bad" relative to if you want to be happy. If you are okay with being unhappy, then lie a lot. If you want to be happy, lie as little as possible. If you want to realize God, lie as little as possible.
</p>

<p>
	There is only one reason you lie: fear. If you were immortal, untouchable, and fearless you would never lie. In other words if you were God, you'd never lie. Really think about that. That's deep.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute ethics is Truth/Love. It is Goodness without an opposite. It is God.
</p>

It will be unique for each person, and it will even change for the same person over time.
</p>

<p>
	You must experiment and see what works best for you.
</p>

<p>
	You can certainly maintain a 1hr daily meditation practice or Kriya yoga practice while you do pickup or dating. That's the minimum I'd recommend.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking you should set an overarching goal/plan for your year. What is the biggest thing you'll be focusing on this year? Attraction? Enlightenment? Business? Improving self esteem? Better nutrition? etc.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to do it all at once. Space things out. You'll be amazed how much stuff you can do in 5-10 years if you focus.

<p>
	That's a belief you should question.
</p>

<p>
	It seems nothing will change, but the whole point of this work is that appearances are very deceptive.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, just take a psychedelic. Otherwise you will waste 10 years and still not realize what you're missing. I am not kidding about psychedelics. They will change your life forever. There is no more powerful tool for understanding reality.
</p>

<p>
	You absolutely need to hit entirely new states of consciousness to understand the power and depth of this work.

<p>
	Let go of what you've been told and sit with an empty mind. You must enter a deep state of not-knowing. The simple truth is, you do not know what you are.
</p>

<p>
	Make a clear distinction between talking about, reading about, listening to, or thinking about what you are, versus actually sitting and silently observing what you are. These are totally different activities.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: What Is Actuality? to help ground yourself in the actual work.
</p>

<p>
	Or, just take a psychedelic.

<p>
	Pickup theory does not apply to women trying to find men. Women need a whole different set of advice and techniques. You can find tons of material specifically tailored to women. Dating advice for women. It is not going to involve cold approaching men on the street asking for phone numbers.

Really, really, really advanced stuff! It took me tens of years of earthly development before I got to the lofty topics I'm now covering. There are many earthly materialistic development topics which I hardly cover at all even though they are very important for the average viewer.

<p>
	It's sort of like I'm teaching a college calculus class but you walk in by accident as a 5th grader. You need to handle the basics first.
</p>

<p>
	What most of you guys need is some basic Tony Robbins shit. Do some of that before you try to get all spiritual. Be mindful of getting ahead of your skiis.

<p>
	I'm not sure what this means.
</p>

<p>
	The finite can know the infinite. And the infinite can know the finite. The infinite is not other than the finite.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand spiritual phrasing in their proper contexts.
</p>

<p>
	What Spria might be talking about is the the Absolute formless Godhead which you can think of as sort of disconnected from the formed realm. You could say that it does not know the finite formed realm. But at the same it is also identical with the finite formed realm.
</p>

<p>
	In this context, you have to understand that the word "know" is virtually identical with "be". We are not talking about linguistic knowledge. We are talking about being.
</p>

<p>
	But all of this talk will only confuse you more. You must let all this go and just do the practices. Take a psychedelic to easily see what Spira is pointing to.

	It's not the weed, it's one's existential questioning that does the work. The weed is just a lubricant. A lubricant does not do the work by itself, it needs a running engine.
</p>

<p>
	Which explains why most people who smoke weed never realize God. Because their engine isn't running to begin with. They are not existentially questioning reality.

<p>
	Low self esteem people tend to be very insecure, helpless, and needy. They love to play victim.
</p>

<p>
	When you are incapable of meeting your basic needs your entire life becomes dysfunctional and backwards. You are forced to resort to outrageous degrees of selfishness just to maintain your basic existence.

	You misunderstood what I asked you. I was not talking about learning more stuff for the hippocampus. I was talking about being conscious of things which you're still not conscious of.

</p>

<p>
	The most ruthless Aztecs probably ate the wisest ones.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. And JFK, Gandhi, and MKL were not the wisest people in our culture. Not even close. They were just relatively wise compared to average political leaders. Which is not a high bar. None of them were enlightened. The wisest people in the culture are so wise hardly anyone knows about them.

</p>

<p>
	A) Material = spirit. A truly spiritual person understands this. Notice the duality you are creating.
</p>

<p>
	B) Karma yoga
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of being spiritual is to infuse your everyday life and "material" actions with spirit. Life purpose is nothing else but working from your heart and higher self -- letting Teotl work through you on account having enough wisdom to see through Teotl's many disguises.
</p>

<p>
	What you call "material" is just you admitting, "I can't see Teotl. I am fooled by Teotl." Material is how Teotl appears to those who are not wise enough to see Teotl's pure form.
</p>

<p>
	Go re-watch my Aztec episode. You still have much to learn from it.
</p>

<p>
	Lack of theory is also a trap.
</p>

<p>
	The opposite of a trap, is another trap.
</p>

<p>
	I see so many Zen devils around due to poor or insufficient theory. And of course the first thing those devils do is dismiss the value of reading or theory. How convenient for a devil to not have to read about his own devilry on the pretense that he is "too woke" to read books.
</p>

<p>
	Lol! It's absurd!

<p>
	There can be no stable forms without survival. Survival IS nothing other than the stabilization of forms within Teotl.
</p>

<p>
	Without survival you could not ask any questions.

And they still haven't got it.
</p>

<p>
	You must appreciate how deep this problem goes.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless, Absolute Truth exists and it can be directly comprehended. But not in the way you're trying to do. Not by sitting there and theorizing about it. Truth is precisely not theory.

</p>

<p>
	Yeah, food is tricky because grabage food is EVERYWHERE and healthy food nowhere.
</p>

<p>
	You must basically cook all your own food if you want to eat clean.
</p>

<p>
	Diet is super important. It's really the foundation. You will not get far with self-actualization without proper diet.

<p>
	You and I are identical, nothing.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is you're getting too attached to perceptions and forms.
</p>

<p>
	Consider: you could have perceptions of there while I have perceptions over here, yet we are still one. I am still you. In the same way that the entire universe is one thing.

</p>

<p>
	Genetics is just universal memory.
</p>

<p>
	The genetics of a donkey do not allow it to have sufficient consciousness to learn mathematics.
</p>

<p>
	Humans brains have enormous variety. We do not all have one type of brain. Each brain has unique pros and cons. Some are good at linear thinking, others at meditation, others at emotions, others at art, others a language, others at psychic powers, etc.
</p>

<p>
	No one brain does it all equally well. There are real tradeoffs.

<p>
	How much consciousness one can muster definitely depends on genetics and physiology.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is of course prior to genetics. But this means jack if your brain is fucked up.
</p>

<p>
	This is simply not recognized by most spiritual traditons because they are 1000 years older than genetics or neuroscience.
</p>

<p>
	If your brain is filled with lead and mercury, good luck getting enlightened. You'll have ADD so bad you will barely be able to read a book.
</p>

<p>
	The deep problem here is that genetically gifted spiritual people take their own abilities totally for granted, as if everyone has them. No they don't.

<p>
	The upside of rolling solo is that you grow very fast, as long as you're able to do approaches. If you're going out solo and you're so scared that you don't even approach, then you're not ready for that yet. You need a wingman/friend.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14201-brenzo2/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14201" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14201-brenzo2/" rel="">@Brenzo2</a> You mean you're in a relationship but you want to build your pickup skills at the same time? That's hard. In practice, once you get in a comfortable relationship your pickup skills will suffer. There's a trade-off.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4468-joel3102/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="4468" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4468-joel3102/" rel="">@Joel3102</a> Yes, it certainly is, but it's going to take much more work than you imagine at the outset. But the upside is that it will also be much more rewarding (in terms of growth) than you imagine. To really get good at pickup you need to hit it hardcore for a couple of years, approaching 5000+ people. You need to take it very seriously. A half-assed attitude will not work here. You basically need to rewire and retrain much of your mind. Attraction is extremely counter-intuitive. It will shock you. You'll be in for some rude awakening. It will be emotionally difficult. But it will grow you like crazy. If you do it, don't do it for the sex, do it for the stronger man it makes you. It can also be very fun and exciting compared to sitting at home and playing Fortnite. Doing pickup hardcore makes you feel ALIVE! It makes you feel like a hero on his journey towards manhood.
</p>

<p>
	I highly recommend handling this part of your life. Just don't be a douche, don't hurt women, and don't develop an ideology or identity around it.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get serious about learning this skill set, you must bite the bullet and move to a large city with great nightlife and lots of hot girls. LA, NYC, Chicago, Miami, Austin, Vegas, London, etc. It's very worth it. Don't be trying to learn pickup in some redneck part of the world. You need volume to practice on. If you're not willing to relocate, you're not very serious about it.
</p>

<p>
	But at the same time, don't make excuses if you can't relocate immediately. Begin wherever you're at and make plan to upgrade your situation.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is not just about attracting girls. Pickup is about upgrading your entire lifestyle. It's about better nutrition, better fitness, better apartment, better decor, better cloths, better haircut, better friends, better car, better everything. Transform yourself into an attractive fucking man with an awesome life such that a woman would be itching to be around you. Shed your old childish ways. Become awesome. When you become a truly awesome, valuable man, guys and girls will flock to be around you. This is not some gimmick. You are actually becoming awesome. It's a total makeover.
</p>

<p>
	But also don't get lost in it. Return to spirituality once you've completed that phase of your life.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. There are always limits to everything a human does. Don't let that stop you from being awesome. You don't need to sleep with 100 girls. You don't need to become the Michael Jordan of pickup. You just need to become decent and score a few girlfriends. Which basically any guy can do.

And the closer you get the Truth, the more the mind resists.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be spirituality without self-discipline and training.
</p>

<p>
	There is no magic trick for avoiding this. It must be faced. Which grows you in and of itself.

The good news is you're actually way ahead of the curve because you've already found the most important thing: the field of personal development and spirituality. Most people won't find these fields until they are 30, 40, or 50 years old.
</p>

<p>
	Since you're only 17 you've got many many years to resolve all those issues.
</p>

<p>
	I have made multiple videos where I give a blueprint of how to begin doing personal development and I give long lists of techniques.
</p>

<p>
	Just pick a thing and start working on it. Focus on whatever your heart wants most. If it's girls, then go chat up girls. A very simple exercise is to go to the local mall on the weekends and start trying to have conversations with shop clerks. Try to chat them up. Don't even hit on them, just chat with them. Try to make the conversation last for 5, 10, 15 minutes. Try to make them laugh.
</p>

<p>
	After practicing that for a few months, then start applying those exact same skills at school by approaching random girls at lunch. Girls you don't know. Just teach yourself how to socialize. You don't even need pickup skills at this point. Learn to have conversations with strangers. Learn small talk. Learn eye contact. Learn how to talk about yourself. Learn how to tell interesting stories. Learn how to smile. Learn how to project your voice. Learn how to be friendly.
</p>

<p>
	All of this stuff has been written about in books and talked about in videos ad nauseam. Just go apply it. Break it down into small actionable steps.
</p>

<title>Love &amp; Belonging need</title>

Or at least they will not believe that self-love can help because they think they need other-love.
</p>

<p>
	So can you? Yes.
</p>

<p>
	Will you? I wouldn't bet on it.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to crawl before you fly. Self-love is much harder than finding someone else to love you. Self-love requires a lot of maturity and consciousness to execute.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't it true that you hate yourself? Think about what it would take to never hate yourself again.

<title>LEO- Spirituality vs Relationships, Advice.</title>

You're always just relating to your own needs, the way that person fits into your life. The relationship is always about you relating not who she is, but to your fantasies of what you want and need her to be. But the actual her never lives up to your fantasies so you try to change her over and over again, which still doesn't work, until eventually you give up and leave.
</p>

<p>
	YOU ARE ALWAYS RELATING TO YOUR OWN EGO! Not to what is actual. You don't give a rats ass about what is actual. You want to live in a fantasy. But you want it to feel like its real. So you just call your fantasy reality.
</p>

<p>
	EVERYTHING YOU DO IS YOU MAINTAINING YOUR OWN FANTASY. Every thought you have and every emotion you feel is part of this effort. Notice this. Then maybe you can learn how to relate to things actually.
</p>

<p>
	Lol

<p>
	Your logic is like this:
</p>

<p>
	Doctor: "Bob, you've got psychosis. You are hallucinating demons."
</p>

<p>
	Bob: "But doctor! How could that be so? Hold on doc, let me check. Hey, demon! Come here. Now answer me truthfully demon: You really exist right? I can trust you right?"
</p>

<p>
	Demon: "Yes, of course you can trust me Bob. I'm totally real. I would never lie to you."
</p>

<p>
	Bob: "Ah good. I knew I wasn't crazy. See doctor! I'm not crazy. I asked the demon and it assured me that it's real and it sounded convincing. So what's going on here doctor? How do you explain it?"
</p>

<p>
	Demon: "Don't trust anything the doctor says Bob. Better yet, maybe you should just kill him. After all, he's clearly a bad doctor if he thinks you're crazy. If you don't kill him, this doctor might harm many innocent patients like yourself over his long career. So yeah, it's best if you kill him and make a soup out of his remains. There's good nutrition in those bones. Would be a shame to let those juicy bones go to waste. Quickly now! Just bonk him over the head with this hammer."

<title>What made the “legends of enlightenment” different?</title>

<p>
	Contemplate how many thousands of people even greater than Jesus, Buddha, and Mahavira lived and died, but you never knew about them due to lack of marketing.
</p>

<p>
	The things you know about you only know about for one reason: someone marketed the shit out of them. Not because they are the best.
</p>

<p>
	What made them different was that they were genetically predisposed to it. They are freaks of nature, like someone who is 7 ft tall. Good luck beating him at basketball. Mental capacities are correlated to the brain. You are never going to get a donkey to understand trigonometry.
</p>

<p>
	And now, for those of you who are eager to turn what I said into a victim mindset about how you can't achieve enlightenment. We'll that's nonsense. You can. You're just making excuses. It would be like arguing that you can't play basketball since you're not 7 ft tall. You don't need to be 7 ft tall to play basketball. Will you be the best basketball player in the world at 5ft tall? No. But being the the best in the world is an ego trip. Let it go. Just be the best that YOU can be.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to be Sadhguru or Buddha or Christ. Be you.
</p>

<title>Combining Spiral Dynamics with my geography class</title>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not a good model for explaining in 15 minutes. You're gonna feel very rushed and people will not really understand it in that short a time. It's likely to confuse them or misinform them.
</p>

<p>
	For example, calling the USA Blue is far too simplistic and will lead to incorrect conclusions. Spiral Dynamics needs to be complex because it's describing very complex phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps choose a different topic.
</p>

My only issue is that I don't see him having a chance in hell of winning the Democrat primaries. He won't even be in the top 5.

	Besides being good on policies a politician needs to be charismatic, able to rally people behind him, and excite his base.

Does the person you're voting for really have a chance of winning? Will your donation go to waste?
</p>

<p>
	Simple-mindedly voting for the highest stage candidate is not good enough. Because society might not be ready for stage Yellow yet, or because stage Yellow might not be the right counter-balance to stage Blue & Orange in the way that stage Green might be. You have to consider all these nuances. There are many stage Yellow people in the world who would not make for effective politicians or who might not introduce significant enough policy proposals. Dealing with the hardcore right in this country is not easy. You have to know how to drive a hard bargain. Meeting them half-way often doesn't work so well (as we saw with Obama). Sometimes a good battle is necessary to bring the losing position into collective awareness.

<p>
	Spiral stages are equal in the absolute sense but are inferior/superior in the relative sense.
</p>

<p>
	Just like drinking pure spring water is relatively better for a human being than drinking water from a public toilet. But in the absolute sense, the toilet water is no worse than spring water.
</p>

<p>
	The value of water is RELATIVE to the health of a human being. So it is important IF you care about human health. It is not important in the absolute sense.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to politics and issues of governance be careful not to adopt too much of an absolute perspective, since politics is a question of pragmatic solutions for issues of survival. Poliltics requires a pragmatic eye. What will actually improve peoples lives? What will put mankind in harmony with our environment? Taking an absolute stance on such questions is a mistake.
</p>

<p>
	For example, naive people pursuing nonduality might wrongly conclude that after enlightenment voting no longer matters because they are now so above politics. So they stop voting. But then that action might lead to a facist getting elected and starting WWIII or outlawing spirituality. There cannot be a decent society without voting. Good luck getting enlightened in North Korea. It is not enough to just get enlightened, you must also help to create a society where other people can get enlightened like you did. It is not right to say, "Well, I'm enlightened now, so fuck ya'll." Because you would have never gotten enlightened if all enlightened people took that attitude. The path to your awakening was laid by millions of people working for thousands of years to create a society which would allow it. So it would be kind of you to return the favor.
</p>

<p>
	Remember the important role that balance plays in earthly life. The point of politics is to get our collective balance right, so we don't fall into collective disease.
</p>

<p>
	No one is above politics. Not as long as you care about living. By not voting, you've cast your vote for the status quo.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness = Nothingness = Everything

<p>
	But the question is, how conscious are you?

<title>What actually changes when your consciousness increases?</title>

<p>
	Consciousness is irreducible -- since it is the only thing there is. What changes is your degree of consciousness. You need to get an experiential hit on what degrees of consciousness are. Psychedelics are the easiest way to do that.

<p>
	Classic newbie mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Your own mind will trick you like that and get you to believe that having fun with your friend is accomplishing something. It isn't. Fun is fun. But it's not enough to get you the skill set you want.
</p>

<p>
	You must force yourself to approach 10-20 sets each night. No excuses. It's best to start approaching immediately upon walking into the club. The first girl you see, you approach.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why when you get a bit more experience and comfort, you should hit the clubs solo. Solo you can really do some damage in the club. Hanging to your friends too tightly will not allow you to get laid. You must be ready to break off from your friend to approach girls, and bounce them to new locations. It is not enough to just approach a girl and stand with her in the same spot the entire night. Once she's attracted to you, you've got to bounce her as much as possible around the place and then outside the place to other places and ultimately to your apartment. Pickup does not work without leading and bouncing.
</p>

<p>
	Solo is highly efficient. But it's emotionally hard, because when you're out of set you feel very alone.
</p>

This is quite unusual activity.
</p>

<p>
	Your typical girl probably goes to the club a few times a year when her friends drag her along.

<p>
	98% of all sex happens from introductions from her social circle and maybe work acquaintences.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is NOT how most sex happens.

	You are forgetting to reflect your own logic back in on itself: your own logic is a hallucination which you are unwittingly trusting.

	Very interesting.
</p>

<p>
	Increasing beta is not right though. You want beta to be as low as possible and alpha as high as possible. That's what meditation does.

<p>
	Yes, coherence is super important.
</p>

<p>
	Gamma is also important.

</p>

<p>
	Let's apply your logic to the USA. How come Donald Trump is putting children in cages and bombing the Midde East when we have people like Eckhart Tolle, Adyashanti, and Peter Ralston teaching nonduality?
</p>

<p>
	How come we have Catholic priests molesting children when the truth of nonduality is readily available in thousands of YT videos?
</p>

<p>
	Every culture has vast diversity, from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high.
</p>

<p>
	The wisest people are never in charge, never in politics, never mainstream.
</p>

<p>
	And don't forget stages of development. Although the Aztec shamans accessed nondual states they were not high on the Spiral. They were mostly Purple, Red, and a bit of Blue. A stage Red person may access a mystical state and then cut out your heart and eat it.
</p>
