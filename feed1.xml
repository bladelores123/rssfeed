<title>Trump &amp; Biden Death Counts</title>

<p>
	Iraq was definitely a royal mistake and it was obvious to anyone with half a brain even back in the early 2000's how unnecessary the war was.
</p>

<p>
	But you also have to understand something: a senator is part of group think. A senator is not some king. The senate basically fooled itself into the war and not much could be done about that. 9/11 cast a spell on the public and government officials too. The whole country wasn't thinking straight. They were also misled by the Bush admin.
</p>

<p>
	Trump, on the other hand, is reckless in ways which are gratuitous. And don't you dare underestimate his ability to start a war.
</p>

<p>
	Again, Biden is no love-dove. He is a centrist. This is well understood by everyone. But a centrist is better than a demagogue right-winger.
</p>

<p>
	While you're counting deaths, you should count how many people were/will be killed by Trump's horrid environmental policy and deregulation.
</p>

<p>
	The environment alone is all the reason anyone needs to vote Biden.
</p>

	You must buy the book and follow it rigorously.

	Sometimes in life the proper move is to be a bit ruthless. This does not contradict Love.

</p>

<p>
	High value is not just about sexual appeal or physical appearance. It's the entire value proposition of being in relationship with someone else.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: The only reason you relate with anyone is to get value out of them. What that value is, will vary. It could be sex, companionship, intimacy, someone to talk to, happiness, peace of mind, security, money, love, children, a house, or whatever. All of that is value.
</p>

<p>
	If you wanted no value, you would not relate in the first place. So don't act like you don't want it. Clearly you do. You want a whole bunch of things from that person. Things you don't even consciously know about.
</p>

<p>
	Being in a relationship is not charity work. You are hoping to extract value from it. And as soon as you stop getting the value you expected, you will break it off to find it elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
	This is not true.
</p>

<p>
	And stop framing this as "tricks" to get in a girls panties. Proper game is about becoming a legitimately more attractive and higher value guy. It is not fake. It is real. The confidence and humor developed through pickup is REAL. And it will be respected and appreciated.
</p>

<p>
	Today I am genuinely much more attractive than I used to be. Because of the development work I did. And any woman who sleeps with me will benefit from that. It's not some trick I'm running on her.

Maybe confidence humor and non neediness is all you need these days (good sex too hehe)
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There are many factors that go into being "high value". You don't need to check every box to get a girl. But the more boxes you check the higher value girl you'll be able to attract and keep.
</p>

<p>
	Edgy means saying and acting is slightly outrageous ways. Edginess spikes the woman's emotions and makes her feel alive and adventurous. An edgy guy keeps the woman's emotions stimulated by saying and doing bold and unusual things. This is what creates that classic "bad boy" vibe.
</p>

<p>
	It is not necessary to get a girl. But it can be highly attractive, especially to very hot, very feminine girls.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing in game is ever necessary. You can get a girl by being a total fool just through pure luck. But game is all about maximizing your value and odds.

	If you struggle with concentration problems, brain fog, fatigue, ADD, autism, inability to meditate, crazy monkey mind, etc. -- that's a good sign you might have heavy metal toxicity and you need to get it fixed before attempting any serious consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness work is basically impossible without a properly functioning brain. Which is what most gurus never tell you.

<p>
	Find a better girl.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about the cheating potential. That girl is gonna have so many emotional problems.
</p>

<p>
	You don't just walk away from being a prostitute without serious trauma.
</p>

<p>
	Even dating a stripper is a huge red flag. She's gonna be nuts.
</p>

<p>
	Given how many nice girls are out there, why on earth would you settle for an ex-prostitute? It shows you have low value and can't get anything better.
</p>

<p>
	Unless you want to do charity work here. Then by all means, go for it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes indeed.
</p>

<p>
	Not dramatic.
</p>

<p>
	It is actually good that women are picky. It encourages the man to be stronger. This gives men an incentive for self-improvement.
</p>

<p>
	The solution for men is not to wish that women were less picky, but to wish oneself to be stronger. And actualize it.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with Incels is that they don't want to transform themselves, so they whine about women being too picky.

<title>Isn't Pickup Unconscious?</title>

		</p>

		<p>
			From my perspective that's a load of bullshit.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said, it all depends upon your standards. If you have low standards you can go develop a deep intimate relationship with a crack whore or a hunchback. But who are we kidding? We want the best we can get.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to go crazy with maximizing sexual value. But your mind IS maximizing it to some degree, whether you know it or not. Feelings of attraction ARE the maximization process at work. It is not a logical process, it is all handled subconsciously by your mind and all you know about it is the feelings of attraction and arousal.
</p>

<p>
	When you feel aroused by another person, that's your mind telling you:
</p>

<p>
	"ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! HIGH SEXUAL VALUE DETECTED! HIGH SEXUAL VALUE DETECTED! CAPITALIZE ON THIS IMMEDIATELY! DO NOT IGNORE!"
</p>

<p>
	And your ego-mind says, "I love that person for who they really are. I'm so loving. This is true love."
</p>

<p>
	It's all self-biased bullshit. A delicious hallucination.
</p>

Just the fact that you have status, fame and money doesn't mean shit to me if you have a shitty personality. Does it really make you happy to "land" a supermodel? This has always confused me.

<p>
	The context of this conversion was sleeping with a Leonardo De Caprio style guy. The female equivalent of which is a supermodel.

	I personally have no interest in chasing down supermodels. I don't even go for 10s because they are not worth the hassle.

There are a lot of "ugly" guys that are with hot women, and no, they aren't necessarily rich or have extraordinary social status. I'm a below average looking guy myself(I would say for sure), yet I have been with very hot women that guys drool over. And I still get interest from a lot of other hot women. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe it also comes with the mindset as I don't really care that much about a women looks. Most important to me is her personality. Which differentiates me from most guys as most guys do care most about a female's looks. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A supermodel is a lot more than just a hot girl. She has fame, status, and millions of dollars.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, I could bang a hot nobody girl. But landing an actual supermodel is a very different matter. She's not gonna date a guy who's not at least a millionaire.
</p>

<p>
	Celebrity dating is a whole nother league, son.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I once went on a date with the 75th top ranked Russian pro tennis star. She was buying BMWs with cash and she was smoking hot. Her body was incredible. But we didn't get along so I never got the chance to sleep with her. But I got real close. If our personalities were more aligned it would have happened.
</p>

<p>
	So yeah, even a guy with my looks can attract hot girls. But it requires game. It ain't gonna happen "naturally".

<p>
	No one is talking about taking away their voice.
</p>

<p>
	But they should not have a disproportionate voice as they do now.
</p>

<p>
	It is absurd that somehow rural areas are special and need more of a voice. Every person gets one vote. Just because your village is in the middle of nowhere does not entitle you to more voice. Your village matters less than NYC because it has 1000 times fewer people. It's not villages who vote, but people.

<p>
	Right... but now compare that to how many guys who are incel virgins and can't get a girl at all.
</p>

<p>
	To even sleep with 4 guys by your mid 20s is still more than many non-player guys get.
</p>

<p>
	Because it is far easier for a woman get laid than a man. Unless the man has serious game or status.

<p>
	Of course. The reality is, a woman wants strong emotions. And a player gives that to her like no other man can. Which is why women will cheat on their lame boyfriends and husbands with players. A women with get attracted to whatever guy gives her the strongest emotions.
</p>

<p>
	Again, not all players are short-lived. Many of them settle down once they get tired of gaming or find the right girl.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I'm fine with settling down with a girl I really like. I don't need multiple girls as long as I got one good one. But I will be picky in that case.

<p>
	And I want to bang a new supermodel every night.

<p>
	The difference is, I understand the selfishness of my position.

<p>
	Well, if you don't like it, stop surviving.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is falsehood, so of course it will always disappoint. Which is why the wise seek God/Truth/Love.

<p>
	That's totally up to you. You don't have to sleep with anyone. But if you sleep with Brad Pitt, you should understand the consequences. Brad Pitt is not gonna be loyal to you, sorry. Not unless you are a supermodel. And maybe not even then. Cause he's Brad fucking Pitt.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	You have to understand that if your standards for your sexual partner are very modest, then you should have little problem finding a partner.
</p>

<p>
	This very much hinges on how high your standards are. The higher your standards the more work it takes and the more precarious it is.
</p>

<p>
	If you have high standards it is like trying to balance a knife on its point.
</p>

<p>
	If you are okay with loving any random dude, then that's easy. But also be careful what you wish for. Don't expect him to be all self-actualized for you. Expect him to be a broke, beer-guzzling, sexist, racist fool. Cause that's what a random dude is. And he will probably have anger issues which he will take out on you.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a highly conscious guy who has done a ton of work on himself, what are you willing to give in return?
</p>

But since these guys are high value, they tend to be players who leverage their value and won't commit, or are abusive narcissistic assholes. So eventually by the time you hit your 30s you learn your lesson and lower your standards to guys who are less players, but also less attractive and you find some comfortable compromise position with such a guy and you two settle down.
</p>

<p>
	Then you get divorced.
</p>

<p>
	This is a tale as old as mankind itself. Nothing at all surprising about it. This is the game. The game is happening whether you know it or not, whether you want it or not.
</p>

<p>
	The only way out of the game is not be alone and not have sex. If you're going to play the game, you're gonna suffer its inherent limitations. There is no free lunch in the relative world. Sex and relationships have a high cost. Which is why monks and yogis avoid them entirely.

<p>
	Of course I understand that.
</p>

<p>
	You are describing the female sexual agenda. I totally get it.
</p>

<p>
	But men are under no obligation to cater to your agenda.

<p>
	Well, that's beyond the scope of what most men are interested in learning. Most men want to buy advice for how to get more sex, not how to be nice to their girlfriend.
</p>

<p>
	Again, you are expecting men to want to suit your female sexual agenda. But of course men have their own agenda. Why should men work towards your agenda when you don't care about fulfilling their agenda?
</p>

<p>
	Men are merely doing to you what you are doing to them.
</p>

<p>
	Notice your self-bias here.

<p>
	Haha! And if women would freely open their legs for men when the man wanted it, then men would be much happier with no frustration or burden.
</p>

<p>
	You are not understanding that women and men have conflicting agendas. You expect the man to align to your agenda while you will not do so for him. So here we are stuck in sex wars.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of sexual relations is adversarial. This needs to be understood.

<p>
	Yes, but you will never give your love to a man you don't find attractive.
</p>

<p>
	Neither will a man.
</p>

<p>
	You expect the man to bend over backwards for you. Which is selfish. But when you act selfish, why are you surprised when the man acts selfish too? He's merely mirroring your own selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	Your desire to lock down a high quality man is selfish and that is your agenda. A man is not under any obligation to do that. Maybe he wants that. But maybe he doesn't. And there is noone to say which is right or wrong because this is a purely relative matter.

	High quality women will attract strong men, which is what they want.

<p>
	Then don't sleep with players. Sleep with some shy nerd who has zero game. There are millions of them around so you will have no problem finding one.
</p>

<p>
	But you see, you don't want to sleep with such a man. You are not attracted to that. You are attracted precisely to strong men who are players who would sleep with lots of women. But you selfishly want to lock him down for yourself exclusively.

<p>

<p>
	Likewise for a man. A hot woman can easily be an awful human on the inside. The hottest women tend to be spoiled and emotionally fucked up.
</p>

<p>
	You don't like asshole men, and we men don't like emotional nutcase women. So we're even. Dealing with a crazy emotional woman's drama is no walk in the park.

<p>
	Of course. But you must have heard of hot women who were insane spoiled brats.
</p>

<p>
	Let's not pretend that men are the only cheaters in the game. Women cheat too. Women use men too.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, that's highly relative. Like I said, you are free to date whoever you want. Date a socially clueless and humorless man. Go date an incel. They got zero game. But they also have zero value.
</p>

<p>
	But of course you will never be attracted to an Incel.
</p>

<p>
	You see, you are trying to steal sexual value. What you really want is this: you want a super attractive high value man who will never leverage his value. Well, good luck. The more value a man has, the more he will leverage it. Likewise, the more value a woman has, the more she will leverage it. A hot women will not hesitate to leverage her value to get the best man she can. Don't act like only men do this leveraging. All hot women do it.
</p>

<p>
	If a woman has enough value, she will be able to leverage it to get the man to be loyal to her. But if she has insufficient value, she won't. And this is what really pisses you off. Because you want to be able to lock down a man with higher value than you, and you see how easily that fails. But you still want it because you are greedy. You want value for free. This is otherwise known as stealing value. Your ego-mind wants to steal sexual value. Well, that doesn't work so well. So stop doing it.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I know plenty of players and PUAs who ended up settling for one woman. For most guys, pickup is a phase they go through. They sleep around with a handful of girls until they find one and settle down. Few guys want to be hardcore players for life. This is an exception, not the rule. It's also not very sustainable or even desirable. Dating multiple women gets exhausting and time-consuming.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't pretend like women don't go through a slutty phase. Women sleep around as much if not more than men, but you love to deny it.

			What I find interesting is that the Democrats project their hatred onto Trump but they never ask themselves where they fell down in order to be defeated by someone they have no respect for.  After all, they had the demographic advantage and should have easily won the election.  Trump was able to perceive a discontent that they totally missed and take advantage of it.

<p>
	Democrats self-reflect far more than Republicans.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason Democrats lose is because they have a huge demographic disadvantage with the electoral college and senate system.
</p>

<p>
	Trump exploited peoples' fears and ignorance. Plain and simple. The peoples' true discontent is with the late-stage capitalism system, but they don't understand that, so they are easily exploited by right-wing demagogues.

	If he was truly smart, all of his businesses would not have failed.

<p>
	He started out with more money than he now has. Trump started out with an inheritance of $400 million! Adjusted for inflation, that's more than he's currently worth.

</p>

<p>
	RO bottled water is almost always have minerals added back in as the final stage of the process.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing you gotta watch out for with water bottles is the BPA in the plastic. Best to get 5 gallon BPA-free thick jugs.

<p>
	Isn't it obvious that of course Trump will downplay any illness he gets?
</p>

<p>
	I mean, this is business as usual for him. He downplays anything that makes him look weak.
</p>

<p>
	He seems mostly functional, which means its not lethal for him, and that was the only part that mattered.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, this recovery is pretty impressive for a guy his age and with the garbage he eats.

<p>
	This is just absurd.
</p>

<p>
	You can easily test the impurities level of your tap water and bottled water with a $15 water meter from Amazon.
</p>

<p>
	Bottled water is about 20 PPM. Tap water is around 300 PPM, depending on where you live.
</p>

<p>
	Tap water is not run through RO filters. Bottled water is. It would be super wasteful to run tap water through and RO filter at the city level. RO filters waste 3-5 gallons of tap water to produce 1 gallon of pure drinking water.

<p>
	Yes, of course it is difficult. Good men are rare just as hot women are rare. Dating is an auction system for reproductive value distribution. If you want a high quality mate, you will have to work on it. It won't come for free. Because high reproductive value is very valuable among humans.
</p>

<p>
	The whole key to getting good results in dating is to raise the value you bring to the negotiating table. The higher the value you bring, the higher the value you'll get. Be ware of trying to steal or leech reproductive value like a parasite by offering little in return.
</p>

<p>
	There will never be an easy solution to this problem because reproduction is a struggle for maximizing value. It was never an activity of unconditional love.
</p>

<p>
	You would not sleep with a homeless person. Why not? Does he not deserve your love?

			I mean I get it a lot of guys are into this thing called pickup game. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But this thought was in my mind about how unhealthy or unconscious this has to be. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Guys view dating as a game. They think of it as a sport. They think of it as hunting, fishing or gaming. I mean these are the labels that can be used to describe this phenomenon. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Then, the question that arises in my mind is, wouldn't I consider the guy a predator? 
		</p>

		<p>
			The one who hunts is considered a predator. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So a pua guy picking up my heart isn't a predator? 
		</p>

		<p>
			I somehow cannot wrap my mind around this whole pickup game and think it's normal or caring.. It looks super predatory to me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Also my heart is always looking for true love. I don't want a gamer. But a true lover..
		</p>

		<p>
			At a time when I'm trying to raise my spiritual vibration, I should condemn something that I see as low conscious or unhealthy. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I want people to look for real love and cultivate the path to conscious love and not look at love as a means to an end. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Love should be about loving someone and not hunting or grifting someone to snatch what you want 
		</p>

		<p>
			Did that make sense at all or nah?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	What you have to understand is that that is your agenda based on your needs as a woman.
</p>

<p>
	Guys have a different agenda.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	You must also consider that for guys to attract girls, the guy has to take the lead and do the work. It doesn't happen passively for guys as it does for many girls. If the guy doesn't go out and hunt, he starves.
</p>

<p>
	Hunting is not predatory in some evil sense here. The guy could be hunting for his dream girlfriend/wife. In fact, that's what most guys probably want. But to get her, they must first learn how to hunt in general. You can't just land your dream girl with one attempt. It takes a lot of work and practice. Hunting is not mutually exclusive to romance and love.
</p>

<p>
	Dating can be done unconsciously or consciously, and many shades in between.
</p>

<p>
	And don't forget, just because a guy doesn't get into pickup does not mean he don't abuse or manipulate women. He certainly will as he will be even more desperate and lacking the hunting skills. A starving limping wolf is more dangerous than a strong well-fed wolf.
</p>

<p>
	Also, pickup is not merely about hunting girls. It's most about transforming oneself into a better man in order to attract and keep higher quality girls. In the end the guy will discover that tricking girls doesn't work, so the guy is forced to grow himself to get the best girls.
</p>

<p>
	None of this makes much sense from the girl's perspective because you are not tasked with the burden of approaching. You should be thankful that you don't have to carry that burden because it's quite heavy.
</p>

<p>
	Do some guys abuse it? Of course!
</p>

<p>
	See, the thing is, women LOVE a strong guy. But they don't love the process which a guy must go through to become strong. Women only want the end-result of the work. Women expect that strength to be effortless, natural, and free, without any work. They don't want to know how the sausage is made.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you should realize that what you call "real love" isn't real love. It is selfishness and survival. Women do not love men unconditionally. You are attracted to strong men who fit your survival needs. You are attracted to weak, needy, humorless men.
</p>

<p>
	Men will love women unconditionally the same day that women love men unconditionally. Which is never. All romantic activities are highly conditional, biased, and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't experience them, why do you say they are true?

<p>
	Why? Isn't that what's literally true in your experience?
</p>

<p>
	Maybe what's truly absurd is believing in the magical experiences of others which you have in fact never seen?
</p>

<p>
	Why is it absurd to believe in unicorns, but not absurd to believe in "other experiences" when both are equally imaginary? Contemplate this.
</p>

<p>
	You have to seriously question the assumptions culture has programmed you with. Consider the possiblity that you've been brainwashed into believing that other people are real.

			   Aha! That's a more subtler level of conspiracy theory. See how that criticism might seem like it's not an obvious conspiracy theory, but the underlying defensiveness to the dangers to that psychedelic usage, but these people, while they do have a higher consciousness, still can't catch themselves in the act of being defensive to a specific danger. They get this tunnel vision, and at that point they are now lost in their position.

<p>
	Unless these people are saying I'm part of some secret cabal, I wouldn't call their criticism of me a conspiracy theory. Tons of people will disagree with the stuff I say.
</p>

<p>
	And even calling me a cult leader is not really a conspiracy theory. I get called a cult leader by default by most normies. It's just a standard defense mechanism.

<p>
	I don't propose obessing over it. Many of these are one-time fixes.
</p>

<p>
	Buying a good filtration system for your house is a one-time fix. Easy.
</p>

<p>
	Changing your shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc. are also easy one-time fixes.
</p>

<p>
	Changing your Teflon pans to stainless steel is a one-time fix.
</p>

<p>
	The only cost here is a bit of time and money.
</p>

<p>
	I will shoot a video in the future about how to detoxify your entire lifestyle.

<title>How can you still love your wife after enlightenment?</title>

<p>
	You are still gonna have preferences after enlightenment. If you preferred your wife before, you will probably prefer her afterwards.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment will make you appreciate your wife a lot more. Right now you take her for granted. Afterward you will see her as a goddess.

			Hi , I'm following leo videos for a long time and i remained confused about some spiritual topics.<br />
			My questions are:<br />
			1. On some videos leo talks about consciousness as a quality you have, for example he says "your goal in life is to increase your level of consciousness, or you are not conscious enough, or you have to develop your consciousness and so on.
		</p>

		<p>
			And on other videos he talks about it as the absolute truth, the fabric of reality, god , the thing that everything happens within or even the true nature of me.<br />
			So which one of them is right?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Imagine you are sitting in a room with the lights turned up to 1%. The room is light. But its hard to see clearly what's going on. Now imagine the light is cranked up to 1,000,000% and you see everything perfectly. The room is still the exact same light, but now nothing in the room is hidden from view.
</p>

<p>
	Light = consciousness (in this analogy)

<p>
	There aren't really 2 people. There is one single field of consciousness which imagines separation. This is almost impossible for the ego-mind to understand because your ego-mind assumes it is real and separate from everything else.

	There is Absolute Infinite Consciousness. A state in which the Universe telepathically interconnects with every corner of itself in infinite directions and infinite dimensions to realize itself fully and totally as precisely what it is: LOVE

<p>
	Contemplate this question:
</p>

<p>
	Assume God really did exist. How could God ever be sure he was God? Who would he ask? since anyone he asked would be himself. What if God asked himself but then lied to himself? Would that mean God exists but never knows he is God?
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	God is not merely a feeling. It is TOTAL OMNISCIENCE of all of reality in one fell swoop. Imagine if you understood in one fell swoop how you designed every hair on your head and every molecule in your parents' bodies.
</p>

<p>
	What you're not appreciating is that the Universe is capable of TOTAL OMNISCIENCE. It can know itself perfectly.

	It's not about being boring. It's about being more welcoming and loving of low consciousness people.

<p>
	In the end, even the most ignorant people need our understanding and compassion because they cannot help themselves.

	I will model that better in the future. I'm sorta getting the edginess out of my system now so I can be more solid as I get older and more mature.

<p>
	New institutions are being built as we speak. Just over the last year companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. have started cracking down on conspiracy theories and toxic right-wing ideologies. And that will only get better going forward. It's far from perfect, but these platforms need time to properly flesh out their moderation teams and guidelines, and to code better AIs.
</p>

<p>
	Sanity will come from the center. The function of centrists is to ground both extremes of the left and right. Majority of the country is centrist, and that's not as terrible as some lefties would have you believe.
</p>

<p>
	People like us are the sanity, if we ground ourselves in Consciousness, Truth, and Love. We must serve as the conscious leaders of the next generation.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all this chaos is an opportunity for you to rise up to your full Godly potential and to guide mankind towards the light. The devils that lurk around you are there to test your divinity. Will you stand for Love, or succumb to the fear? That is the only game in town.

<p>
	Yes, chaos and suffering increases violence which increases suffering until the fever breaks. Increased violence seems very likely. It's hard to tell how bad it will get before the fever breaks.
</p>

<p>
	Your job is to meet the situation head-on with Consciousness and Love.

<p>
	I think the craziness has to play itself out so that people can suffer from the consequences and learn to let go of unworkable and painful ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Humans basically learn through suffering. Excess leads to chaos and suffering, suffering leads to a desire for re-balancing, sanity, and peace. And so it goes in cycles. It's the Hegelian dialectic. We have had 80 years of relative peace since WWII. This peace has made us complacent and spoiled. Now this peace is starting to crack as the old system which got us here will not be enough to get us to the next level, but people are not willing to evolve consciously. So there will be suffering. This is what the Orange >> Green transition looks like. It has begun, but only just, so there is much backlash.

<p>
	I don't know about that.... America is pretty fucking corrupt with capitalist ideology and money and habits.

<p>
	I think you are right that we would not get Soviet style gulags, executions, and dictators. But I think there would be enormous cultural backlash, and business leaders would probably start a plot to bring back the old system which they have gotten addicted to.
</p>

<p>
	For socialism to truly work it requires more than merely changes in law. It requires a cultural reprogramming. Which freaks people out. If socialism was implemented in full, it could be enough to cause a real second Civil War.

<p>
	Don't poo-poo quality education. All of my work with Actualized.org is grounded in a solid classic education. I wouldn't be here otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why Trump supporters are mostly white people with no college education. And why they are so prone to toxic conspiracy theories. And why the right-wing is so critical of universities. 2/3rds of Americans have no college education. If 50% of Americans had a college education, Trump would never have gotten elected. Quality classic education is hugely important. It teaches people basic academic rigor which cut down conspiracy thinking a lot.
</p>

<p>
	Universities are somewhat corrupt, but overall they are a net positive force in society. We need more, not less. And also better.

</p>

<p>
	A Trumpist's definition of truth is inferior to that of the mainstream news. The mainstream news is biased, but at least they have serious journalists with some integrity working for them. The Trump cult just makes up bullshit all day long and treats it as truth.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This can be a clever cop-out by lefties. I think it's too convenient to say that true communism was never attempted. The point which conservatives are right about is this: what if it can't really be attempted because human nature doesn't allow it to even get off the ground? At least not at our current level of development.
</p>

<p>
	If every time communism is attempted it goes horribly wrong, that tells us something important about the lack of fit between communism and people. It's sort of like saying, "I've never truly attempted to put on a size 8 shoe" when my foot is size 12. Yet I keep going to the store and buying size 8 shoes, convinced that one day a "true attempt" will finally get it on my foot.
</p>

<p>
	"True attempt" is a very loaded and sneaky notion in this situation.
</p>

And to give such power to a child would be an act of cruelty in my opinion.

<p>
	Yes, I totally agree. That's the biggest lesson we learned from Soviet Russia, China, and Korea.
</p>

<p>
	Socialist ideals are good, but ideals are not enough to make a thing fly. It needs to be practical too. A 1st grader cannot handle algebra. Most people are too selfish to handle socialism. So we need to work on the selfishness part.

<p>
	Sure. That's selfishness and survival and devilry in action. It's been that way since the dawn of civilization. It is important to study and understand how selfishness and survival and devilry work.

<p>
	Proper, quality education -- while admittedly a rare thing -- does not make you a slave. It teaches you how to learn and think for yourself and how to have high epistemic standards.
</p>

<p>
	Media makes you stupid if you don't use it properly by not diversifying your sources and not reading books.
</p>

<p>
	Corruption is certainly a problem.

	I admit I was very provocative. Similar to my Libertarianism video. Yeah, it pisses some people off. I should soften up my approach in the future. I am still learning what upsets people because intellectual stuff doesn't upset me so it's hard for me to know ahead of time which ideas will offend people.

	Of course there will never be any such clear lines. Our knowledge is highly limited and fallible.

			Interestingly, I could rephrase your statement and generate a talking point on the opposite side of the political spectrum: "Yes, any far-left politics in America will functionally be communist in its outcome -- which is what Blue conservatives are reacting to. I totally get that." It is interesting that both sides (left/right) appeal to the slippery slope argument.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	And in a sense that's not wrong. If you listen to the most radical leftists they tend to want some pretty radical socialistic stuff that probably will never work in practice, at least not for hundreds or thousands of years. Yes, both extremes of the political axis are slippery slopes that veer off into delusional ideas of society which will never scale to the mainstream. The center is a pragmatic compromise and tends to scale well.
</p>

<p>
	For example, some far leftists advocate the idea of totally open boarders or actually disbaning the police. This is a silly utopian idea that will never fly. Covid clearly shows the importance of national boarders.
</p>

<p>
	But there is still a difference. The ideals of communism are more conscious than the ideals of white supremacy or nationalism. There is no way that white supremacy will ever work in the future. But communism or socialism might. It's just a question of, To what degree?
</p>

<p>
	White supremacy is an evolutionary dead end. Socialism is not. At least not yet. There is much to study and learn from socialism even if we don't fully go socialist (which, BTW, I don't advocate doing in our lifetime). But there is little value to studying the merits of white supremacy or nationalism other than as an example of what not to do. At least not in developed countries like the USA or Europe. Maybe in the Middle East or Africa nationalism still has some merit, although even that is becoming hard to stomach. The illusion that your nation/culture is the best simply cannot survive in our globalized economy.
</p>

<p>
	How much easier life would be if people simply surrendered the notion that their culture/nation/race is the best. It's such an obviously childish and self-biased position.

<p>
	Obstacles are a function of the ego's desire to survive in its limited form.
</p>

<p>
	See, if you surrendered yourself to Truth completely, there would be no obstacles. But also no guarantee of survival.
</p>

<p>
	So you're caught in an existential bind. On the one hand you want life to be effortless and truthful. On the other hand you want to survive, which is falsehood. These two things are in existential conflict.
</p>

<p>
	The core existential problem is this: survival is falsehood. So it must always fail because falsehood isn't true.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Probably a bad idea.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to make some rash move.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are homeless, enlightenment will probably be the last thing on your mind as you struggle just to stay warm.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, after enlightenment, all your survival needs will still have to be met. Enlightenment WILL NOT solve your survival needs for you. Very dangerous and naive to assume so.
</p>

<p>
	Do you know what monks spend most of their day doing? Cleaning toilets and cooking food. Survival. They do that for 8 hours. Then they meditate for like 3 hours. That's typical monk life. They do not meditate 18 hours a day as you might imagine. That is not a luxury they have.
</p>

<p>
	Ideally you'd save up a nest egg of so much money that you could just take a year off work and meditate while living in a comfy cabin. This is far more realistic than being homeless.
</p>

<p>
	No, just an example.

<p>
	It's a great example when meditation teachers pretend like meditation can get you there. Salvia shows you, No you are fooling yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing will humble you like a puff of salvia. That shit is insane. You won't understand what consciousness can do without it. Consciousness is so much more radical than any meditation teacher knows.

	No way you will access that naturally through his meditation programs. Bliss and peace of mind is not the same thing as Infinite Consciousness and I gaurantee none of his students have accessed Infinite Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Of course they are not an ultimate solution. You will still have to do meditative work.

	Corruption obviously is a real problem and I speak out against it.
</p>

<p>
	I have a whole video about corruption and I say that is the #1 problem in government.
</p>

<p>
	I think the problem here is that you hear me denounce "conspiracy theory" and you take that to mean: "no two people ever get together to plan something selfish", which is obviously not what I mean when I denounce conspiracy theories.

	They are over-looking the stage Red aspects of Trump.

<p>
	Trump is not merely excess Orange. He's not as bad as Hitler, but he ain't no ordinary businessman either.

	I hesitated to start this thread. If it gets out of hand I'll locked it down. I thought it might be illuminating to see inside the minds of conspiracy theorists, but maybe it's a waste of time. I am open to both sides of the argument.

<p>
	If you can't use porn responsibly, then don't use it.
</p>

<p>
	Is this not obvious? Must daddy Leo tie your hands behind your back?

<p>
	It's like you want me to agree with your no-fap stance, and I just don't care about micromanaging your dick. Other than to say that if you are gonna consume porn, consume good porn.

	Ladies and gentlemen, what this forum is missing is a mega-list of every conspiracy nutcase on YouTube.
</p>

<p>
	Half of the purpose of this thread is entertainment, the other half is to showcase how the conspiratorial mind works.
</p>

<p>
	Go find me the crazy people. The Alex Jones', The Eddie Bravo's, The QAnnoners, etc.

			I would take this as a hint and try making a few short (20 minutes max) videos just for a change. The average mind is only capable of being focused for about 20 minutes, plus you dumb everything down to the simplest bits. How about making a couple of short videos on a couple of small topics without breaking them down to the detail level? Do you plan on experimenting with this? Or is the fear of creating ideology/cult holding you back?

<p>
	I have always had plans to make short videos, but somehow I haven't gotten around to it.
</p>

<p>
	I want to make a series of short videos for newbies. But ironically, making good short videos requires more time, work, and planning than making longer ones.

		<p>
			A senior monk and a junior monk were traveling together. At one point, they came to a river with a strong current. As the monks were preparing to cross the river, they saw a very young and beautiful woman also attempting to cross. The young woman asked if they could help her cross to the other side.
		</p>

		<p>
			The two monks glanced at one another because they had taken vows not to touch a woman.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then, without a word, the older monk picked up the woman, carried her across the river, placed her gently on the other side, and carried on his journey.
		</p>

		<p>
			The younger monk couldn’t believe what had just happened. After rejoining his companion, he was speechless, and an hour passed without a word between them.
		</p>

		<p>
			Two more hours passed, then three, finally the younger monk could contain himself any longer, and blurted out "As monks, we are not permitted a woman, how could you then carry that woman on your shoulders?"
		</p>

		<p>
			The older monk looked at him and replied, "Brother, I set her down on the other side of the river, why are you still carrying her?"

	But even in that case, it is understandable that if the government has access to advanced alien technology they would obviously keep it top classified for military and strategic defense purposes. And otherwise, the government probably does not have a solid understanding of UFOs, so they don't have much useful to say.
</p>

<p>
	And even here, the US Navy has released official UFO footage. So it's not like they are hiding it very well.

<p>
	Everything needs to be upgraded to organic, all-natural, non-toxic. Ditch all the cheap popular brands of soap, shampoo, make-up, shaving cream, detergent, deodorant, toothpaste, face cream, sunscreen, lip balm, contact lens solution, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Get rid of EVERYTHING toxic!

			Let's see if you'll even bother addressing this obvious deconstruction of your logic, or if you'll conveniently ignore it, once again, in favor of something less challenging.
		</p>

		<p>
			We can undeniably agree that a racist person will not self-identify as racist, nor will a fascist self-identify as such, nor a neo-Nazi and the likes. What separates a white supremacist from this group? A white supremacist must simply conform to the definition, which is simply <em>"The belief that white people are inherently superior to people from all other racial groups, especially black people. and are therefore rightfully the dominant group in any society"</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			According to you, the definition of white supremacist is <em>"Any person who overtly refers to themselves as a white supremacist"</em>.<br />
			I imagine your definition of racist is <em>"Any person who overtly calls themselves racist" </em>with no further qualifiers. This is obviously untrue.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's complicated.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously most racists do not self-identify as racist, nor do they need to in order to be considered racist. But white supremacy is a slightly different matter. If you truly believe the white race is superior and meant to rule over others, you'd be more open about it.
</p>

<p>
	While you bemoan the problem of white supremacists not being willing to call themselves out as such, you're overlooking the opposite problem: you projecting white supremacy on people whose worldviews you don't really care to understand or distinguish.
</p>

<p>
	According to you, anyone you suspect of being a white supremacist IS a white supremacist -- because you say so. How convenient! How would anyone ever prove you wrong? Even if the person tells you, "But I'm not a white supremacist! I don't believe whites are better than blacks" you will say, "Of course, that's exactly what a white supremacist would say!"
</p>

<p>
	Vaush falls into this trap on a daily basis. It comes from a lack of perspective.

<p>
	This dude is a serious right-winger. But this video does not show him claiming that whites are superior to blacks. It might seem that way, but if you listen carefully the point he is making (using his right-wing logic) is that black people should stop acting like victims. This is what he means by "you people". "You people" = black people who act like the white man oppressed them and needs to fix them.
</p>

<p>
	I think his view is dumb, but I would not call that white supremacist.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that liberals and progressives LOVE to call right-wingers white supremacists the second they hear any kind of ethno-nationalist talking points.
</p>

<p>
	Being ultra-conservative does not equal white supremacy, even though the two may look similar in the mind of a left-winger.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is FAR more complex than you make it out to be.

	He doesn't have the intense negatives of Hilary though. Hilary was uniquely disliked. And back then people did not understand what kind of monster Trump would be.

	We are in very different waters now. Trump can no longer hide his monstrosity. That is the single biggest difference between 2016 and 2020.

<p>
	But that's the rub, conspiracy theorists use their theories to ground their meaning and reality. They need those theories to explain the world and to explain things like evil. Taking that away from them is like taking away a child's baby blanket.
</p>

<p>
	Without the conspiracy theories they will have an existential / epistemic crisis.

<p>
	Actually, I was surprised to that anyone was upset or triggered. I thought this was obvious stuff except maybe for the pedophilia stuff which I know people love to demonize over.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes it is hard for me to predict the ways in which people will misunderstand that things I say. It can be hard to put myself into the shoes of a low-consciousness person. I basically assume you've watched all my previous videos, and that's almost never the case. Of course I sound nuts to some newbie stumbling upon one of my latest videos for the first time.

<p>
	As I said, the reason conspiracy theories are so alluring is precisely because they mix kernels of truth with bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	Pointing at the kernels of truth is the classic maneuver conspiracy theorists use to lure you into believing the bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	The game works like this: any time you point out how dumb some conspiracy theory is, the conspiracy theorist will point at the kernels of truth. Because the mind a genius at confirmation bias and cherrypicking data to justify its narratives.

	It is amazing how people justify in their minds that it is fair and proper for a minority to rule the majority at the federal level.
</p>

<p>
	The logic goes like this: "But it would be oppressive if the majority ruled over the minority. So let's have the minority rule over the majority. That's only fair, otherwise the minority will get oppressed." [Picard facepalm]

	Seaweed probably has high heavy metal content but it might be balanced out by the other health benefits of seaweed. Hard to say if it's a net positive or not.

<p>
	Not just fish oil, any supplement or food can be contaminated with heavy metals. And there's no way to know without expensive testing.
</p>

<p>
	This problem is far deeper than merely "fish".

<p>
	There are no guarantees here. All you can do is minimize risks.

	Hehe, that is quite something to behold.
</p>

<p>
	Although racism within sexual preferences is not a very strong case. I definitely have racist sexual preferences. I would not sleep with all races equally. I think this is extremely common and not something we're gonna change.
</p>

<p>
	I guess I would like to know if that Asian gay dude truly believes that whites are better, or he simply prefers to sleep with white guys in the same way that I enjoy Asian girls. If he just prefers to sleep with white guys, I get that. My Asian ex-girlfriend liked to date white guys too. She didn't like Asian guys. But I wouldn't call her white supremacist simply due to that. To me white supremacy has a higher bar to clear.

<p>
	I guarantee you it does. Try maintaining a salt water aquarium with sensitive fish and coral.
</p>

<p>
	Did you know that if you roast some cashew nuts on a Teflon pan in the oven and feed it to a parrot, the parrot will die? That's how sensitive biological systems can be to chemicals. A bit of Teflon fumes is enough to kill a bird.

<p>
	Quality RO water is re-mineralized. My RO system has 6 stages (6 filters), one of which is calcium re-mineralization. Bottled RO water is also re-mineralized. You're acting like I'm telling you to drink distilled water.

	You don't technically have to be, but in practice yes.

<p>
	Link us a video of a non-white white supremacist which is not a Dave Chappelle skit. I want to see these non-white white supremacists in action.
</p>

<p>
	And you calling them white supremacists doesn't count. THEY have to self-identify as such.
</p>

<p>
	For example, just because you THINK Sagaar is a white supremacist does not make it so. That's your projection, distinct from his self-identification.

<p>
	You're not going to be feeling love 24/7. That is not possible. That expectation is a recipe for suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not something you feel. Love is what you ARE, regardless of how you feel.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's nice to work on feeling more love. That is important. But don't fool yourself into thinking you must feel love for Love to be real. Love is much more than just a feeling. It is there even when you don't feel it.

<p>
	Hard to say. I imagine it does accumulate in the brain over long periods of time. Better safe than sorry. There is no reason to be drinking cheap unfiltered water. High quality water only costs $28/month in the US.

<p>
	Look man, you're gambling with your brain. Up to you.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, they contain less mercury than salmon. But if you are eating them every day, it will add up. Stomach absorbs 80% of mercury. Then it gets lodged in your brain.

The Proud Boys having black and hispanic people in it is the same thing as a racist misogynist redneck saying "I can't be racist I have black friends!"
		</p>

		<p>
			It's entirely possible to have close connections with people of other races whilst still maintaining an internal sense of your own racial superiority. It's also possible to have friends of other races whilst still maintaining an sense of your racial <em>inferiority.</em> Anti-minority bias in minorities is a real thing. My family comes from a migrant background and yet my aunt was literally complaining about people from our culture a few months ago. It's internalised racism.
		</p>

		<p>
			Watch the video again, you'll notice there's a part where they attack a reporter for being part of the "antifa media." WHen she says shes not antifa they just tell her "well you're still an Arab."
		</p>

		<p>
			That's white supremacy and racialism in a nutshell. If they had an Arab member of the Proud Boys, that wouldn't somehow make their remarks against her OK. They're a racist, white supremacist organisation that accept minorities as a way to deflect from criticism.

<p>
	No, it's different than a racist having a black friend. Here the black guy subscribes to the philosophy. It's like having a black guy in a KKK hood. Why would the black guy do it? Obviously not for the white supremacy.
</p>

<p>
	It's like when Vaush calls Saagar a white supremacist. It's dumb. Obviously Saagar is not a white supremacist, but he likes nationalism. It's not about race for him.
</p>

<p>
	There is a lack of understandimg here of the nationalist worldview. You just instantly smear them as white supremacists.

			That's pretty dumb, my family is black, and I would easily call my own mom a white supremacist. There are tons of white supremacists that aren't white. Proud Boys are undoubtedly white supremacists, and even if we assume the leader isn't a white supremacist on the basis of his race, it's pretty myopic saying the leadership defines what the organization stands for as a whole.

<p>
	You are conflating race and nationalism. These are different things.
</p>

<p>
	The reason blacks, Hispanics, Hindus, Muslims, etc. can support stuff like Proud Boys is because nationalism is not so much about race as it is about preserving a local culture.
</p>

<p>
	Nationalist movements exist in every country around the world. So it's obviously not white supremacy. White supremacy is a sub-set of the more universal impulse humans have for nationalism and ethnocentrism. Racism is a sub-set of that.
</p>

<p>
	Japanese and Hindu nationalists exists. They are similar to the Proud Boys. And they obviously aren't white supremacist.
</p>

<p>
	When you call Proud Boys white supremacist, this actually gives them an upper hand because they clearly see that you do not understand that philosophy and are strawmanning them. It's is similar to how a progressive reacts when he is called a communist by the right-wing.

<p>
	No, he cut ties because Gavin's rich neighbors did not want to associate with him and let him into their country club because he was associated with the Proud Boys. He cut ties because you can't circulate in the company of upper-class millionaires in America while associated with such a toxic group. So Gavin tries to clean up his image. Because what he cares about more than Proud Boy ideology is money, status, fame, and power.

	Fascists always think that stage Green folk are the real fascists.

	Of course you are.

<title>Neither Monism, Nor Duality</title>

<p>
	Nonduality = Monism
</p>

<p>
	Reality is ONE. And One/Many are identical when seen with absolute consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The chief delusion here is thinking that one vs many are someone inherently different.
</p>

<p>
	One vs many is a duality which you must collapse.
</p>

<p>
	If things are not-two, they one. And if things are one, they are also many.
</p>

<p>
	One = Many
</p>

<p>
	You can't have many without one, and you can't have one without many.
</p>

<p>
	The problem these sorts of philosophy videos on YT is that they tend to be created by people who don't have direct consciousness of what they are talking about. So they treat these different philosophies in a purely academic sense. But of course Oneness is not a philosophy at all. It's absurd to frame it that way.
</p>
