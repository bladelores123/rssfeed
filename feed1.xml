<p>
	It's very hard to quantify something like this.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't worry about trying to quantify it. Rather focus on your unique discovery process. However long it takes will be worth it. And it's going to depend on how much effort you put into it.
</p>

<title>Life Coach Financial Viability</title>

<p>
	It all depends on how good you are at business.
</p>

<p>
	Many life coaches make zero because they cannot find clients.
</p>

<p>
	Other life coaches who develop a system for finding clients can make low 6 figures.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like Tony Robbins makes tens of millions because he established an massive brand. It's best not to even think of him as a life coach. He a major business guy.
</p>

<p>
	Life coaching is not different than any other small business. You have to be good at sales and marketing to be successful. If you think clients will just come to you, think again. The hardest part of life coaching is not the coaching, it's creating a steady stream of clients.
</p>

<p>
	Most life coaches fail for this reason. But then again, most businesses fail for this reason.
</p>

<p>
	That's your confusion right there.
</p>

<p>
	You have spent your whole life trying to gain advantage for yourself, but you are not even real.
</p>

<p>
	This work is not about helping yourself out. This work is about realizing you are not real.
</p>

<p>
	What you're looking for is Love, but Love is not found in meaning, it's found in being and selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	Your problem is that you are fundamentally addicted to selfishness, which disconnects you from Love. Meaning is part of your selfishness which you must learn to let go.
</p>

<p>
	You are desperately avoiding emptiness. Yet emptiness is the only thing that can ever satisfy you. So you're stuck in a catch-22.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Even experiences of human connection are still shallow compared to metaphysical realizations.
</p>

<p>
	When you are infinite you are connected to the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	There are good reasons why serious yogis and monks go celebate.

<p>
	That's the paradox. The only solution to evil is to realize it doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
	Which can only happen by doing what it says in my sig.
</p>

<p>
	Evil is a problem of perception, not material fact. This is what people do not want to understand. Therefore evil seems so pervasive.

<p>
	A) Some girls have low sex drive. Period.
</p>

<p>
	B) In general, girls have much lower sex drive then men.
</p>

<p>
	C) You gotta get good at turning girls on so they are dripping wet for you. This is a developed skillset that most guys suck at.
</p>

<p>
	D) You gotta learn how to keep sex fresh, creating exciting new experiences.
</p>

<p>
	E) If she's on medication like anti-depressants, that can lower her sex drive a lot.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I said that precisely to disturb your naive notion that love requires saving people. That is a shallow understanding of love.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation means I don't have to do anything. Liberation means I could kill a baby and still realize I am love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not limited to human survival requirements, ideals, morals, or good or bad actions. Love is absolutely unconditional.
</p>

<p>
	My job is to share insights about reality.
</p>

<p>
	To try to save people would make me attached to outcomes in an unhealthy way and be the opposite of liberation, leading to devilry.
</p>

<p>
	It would be wise to notice that when you try really hard to do good, you end up creating evil. Which is why the wisest people do not feel a need to save anyone.

<p>
	Like I said, many dangers in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Ideas are tricky things. Gotta be very careful with them.
</p>

<p>
	It is important to keep oneself grounded in real life experience. Otherwise armchair philosophy runs amok.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you have great ideas, go put them to the test by creating the things you're talking about. You will quickly discover how foolish your "great ideas" probably were.
</p>

<p>
	Real life will poke holes in all your great ideas.

<p>
	That is the problem.
</p>

<p>
	It's all too easy to sit around and come up with ideas, which lead to ideologies, which to suffering amd death of millions.
</p>

<p>
	Go actually create a hierarchy that works in the real world so you have some inkling of how they work and what function they serve.
</p>

<p>
	How can you improve a thing which you have no experience creating?
</p>

<p>
	It's like a guy giving advice to an aerospace engineer about how to design a rocket, but he's never even designed a toy airplane. This is the mark of an amateur.
</p>

<p>
	If you actually create a productive organization you will see how difficult all these things are and how all your lofty ideals fly out the window.

<p>
	Goooood!
</p>

<p>
	Now you're starting to understand how serious survival is.
</p>

<p>
	You ain't gonna transcend survival as easy as you thought.
</p>

<p>
	If it was that easy, everyone would have done it and the human race would not exist.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the irony that the thing you wish would go away is the very force which resulted in your birth.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're standing on a rug and trying to pull it up from under your feet at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	Denial of the sex drive is not the same as transcendence of it.
</p>

<p>
	My suggestion would be to continue your spiritual practice and engage in sex mindfully rather than deny it. Then maybe one day you will outgrow it as the natural result of your spiritual practice. Maybe.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with such armchair philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	All such proposals could impact millions of lives in negative ways.
</p>

<p>
	Before you get stuck on some pet idea, go create something that works in the real world.
</p>

<p>
	It's too easy to sit behind a computer and think you have the answers to the world's problems.
</p>

<p>
	This is one of the dangers of this work.

<p>
	So make it simple and natural then.
</p>

<p>
	That of course is all part of the work.
</p>

<p>
	You have to customize this work to fit yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Doing this work mechanically or out of a sense of obligation will backfire. The key to spirituality is finding ways to make it seamlessly integrated with your way of life. Not as something gym exercises you force yourself to do once a day, just so you can fall right back into asleep once the timer rings.
</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself, "What would it look like for me to live a conscious lifestyle naturally?", "What would it look like if I lived consciously all the time and it was something naturally did, not something I forced myself to do? How would I think, emote, speak, behave?"
</p>

<p>
	You're not appreciating how serious this work is. We are talking here about attaining immortality. So yeah... you should expect a high cost.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like what you need is 10 years of basic self-help work. Not awakening. You've jumped in the deep end when you should be in the kiddie pool right now.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening will destroy your whole human life. If you don't like that idea, don't pursue it.
</p>

<p>
	You have to WANT to give up your human life.
</p>

<p>
	Again, the topics I talk about are extremely advanced for most people. Just because you hear me on YT don't get the idea that this stuff is intended for random casual audiences. The stuff I talk about is like advanced college-level calculus, while most people still haven't learned algebra.

</p>

<p>
	You gotta contemplate and investigate more honestly the source of your depression. Depression is not just a passive state, it's something the mind is actively doing. So observe yourself doing it and study what your mind is doing and why it's doing it.
</p>

<p>
	Spend week observing and writing down your internal self-talk. What are you saying to yourself about life such that it's making you feel depressed?
</p>

<p>
	Don't tell us, find out first for yourself.

	Do 50 breakthrough trips and then see what questions remain. Less than 10 trips is nothin'.

<p>
	That's great.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some tips to improve your game:
</p>

<p>
	1) She will almost always say she's gotta go. In this case, ask if you can walk with her and continue chatting. You need as much chat time as possible. Don't just accept her excuses. She will always have excuses.
</p>

<p>
	2) Never do Facebook. It's bullshit. Get her number and text.
</p>

<p>
	3) Before you even try for a number ALWAYS try for an instant date. After a short chat, don't ask for her number, ask to get a coffee right now. If she says she's too busy, then get the number.
</p>

<p>
	4) Rather than asking her questions, make interesting observations about her. So instead of, "What do you do?", you say, "You seem like the kind of girl who works with kids." Or whatever. Doesn't matter what you say. Sometimes you can make purposefully wrong assumptions about her just to tease her.
</p>

<p>
	5) If she tells you she's a lawyer, you gotta tease her for that shit: "OMG! I walked over here loving you but I hate you now. I can tell you have an evil lawyer heart." And push her away in a playful manner.
</p>

<p>
	Find every excuse to playfully touch her.
</p>

<p>
	6) Get in the habit of asking, "By the way, are you single?"
</p>

<p>
	7) Always seed the next date. Insist that you will text her and that you two will grab a coffee and talk.
</p>

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	You can also just go to the mall and walk around while practicing making funny observations to yourself about ordinary things you see in the mall. Train yourself to have a commentary on any random thing you see: a tree, a car, a bird, a dog, a bench, an ad, etc.
</p>

<p>
	DO NOT try to script or memorize this stuff. It won't work. Rather you need to train the ability to improv it on the spot.
</p>

<p>
	It helps a lot to put yourself in a good mood as you try to do this. You gotta be relaxed and playful. Not stiff and business-like.
</p>

<p>
	When talking to girls you gotta be like a kid in a candy store. Passionate, playful, spontaneous.

<p>
	Sounds like kundalini. You are stuck at the lower chakras so you're wasting that energy on sex because that's your current level of consciousness/development.
</p>

<p>
	As you spiritually purify yourself you will seek less and less of lower bodily pleasures like junk, TV, and sex.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of yoga is to purify the chakras, body, and mind to unhook you from chasing lower bodily pleasures like sex, food, money, fame, power. All of that wastes enormous energy which could be put to higher use.
</p>

<title>Limitation of Attraction Skills?</title>

		<p>
			Yeah I am well aware about that. Being in a happy relationship already. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I am also well aware that sleeping with a new girl each week is more than reasonable. <br />
			<br />
			The thing I mean specifically, if that makes sense, is what are the limits to creating a fast and lasting connection with a girl in the first place. Like first 5 to 10 minutes you meet her. So far this always came naturally to me at times and sometimes it doesn't which I am generally fine with since you don't connect with everybody. But I wanted to understand to which degree I got to develop myself to being able to have lasting connection with a girl within these first minutes and if I am maybe trying to create something that is stupid, since it is not really important. <br />
			<br />
			I know that if I would date a girl I would have dates etc. and it be on. But randomly without the direct intention of sleeping with her next days to create a connection that she is naturally attracted and kind of in (love). That is what I want to understand, wether I am still lacking this kind of fast connection skill at times. I also don't want to fake anything but be myself for sure. <br />
			<br />
			By the way I see that this is highly egoic intention for validation seeking. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This whole description might be hard to put into words, because it is not so much about the "fuck a bunch of hot girls" thing. But more about my ability to show up as myself and be able to game or attract girls passively while creating a genuine attraction from my side. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Any further advice on this particular thing?
		</p>

		<p>
			Thanks
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Why are you worried about this at all? Just go talk to girls and see what happens.
</p>

<p>
	There are no limits. Attraction can happen in 1 minute and you can build deep rapport within a few hours of conversation.
</p>

<p>
	You can make deep friendships with any random person if you really wanted to.
</p>

<p>
	It does not really matter who the girl is, you can bond with her. It's just a matter of deciding which girls are worth your time and meet your standards.
</p>

<p>
	Get clear about what you want and don't want. The rest will sort itself out.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not a tragic view. That's just how your ego interpets it. You are assigning negative meaning to meaningless, which of course is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to awaken without confronting the truth that all meaning is imaginary. To the ego this can feel depressing and deflating because your ego's whole plan is to concoct and chase meanings until you're dead.
</p>

<p>
	Depression can be a problem on this path, but don't blame it on meaninglessness, blame it on ego.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel this work is making you unstable, take a break for a while. Come back to it later. It means you're not ready yet to go that deep.
</p>

<p>
	Understand that awakening is a very hardcore pursuit. You must be very mature to want it and to actualize it. Many of you are simply not there yet. Don't force it too much. Go live a bit of life first before you try to go full-Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	Full-Buddha is definitely not for most people. You have to really be fed up with material life to go full-Buddha. Many of you here have barely begun material life. Ask yourself why you are pursuing awakening? Is it simply because you are blindly doing whatever Leo talks about? Or does your heart truly desire it?
</p>

<p>
	Be careful doing things I talk about simply because you heard me talk about it.
</p>

	You can get so good you can sleep with a new girl every week.
</p>

<p>
	But that takes a lot of work and training.
</p>

<p>
	Not saying you should do this. Just saying what's possible.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind what you probably just want is to get a nice girlfriend. So that's probably your best goal.

<p>
	Yeah, that is a classic newbie problem. You gotta train yourself to talk your mouth off about yourself. Be totally self-absorbed. Become a chatterbox. Don't hold any thoughts back. Talk about your opinions, desires, hates, plans, feelings, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Talk about the smallest, dumbest things like how you were flossing your teeth today.
</p>

<p>
	You can practice at home in front of a camera. Record yourself explaining how you ate breakfast today and how you felt about it. Make it sound interesting. You gotta turn ordinary life into stories.
</p>

<p>
	STOP BEING LOGICAL in your conversations with girls! That is crucial. Untrain your logicalness.
</p>

<p>
	A good trick is, rather than asking questions, make observations and statements. So instead of asking, "What do you do for work?" or "Where are you from?", you make random or informed guesses like, "You seem like a California girl" or "You seem like you work in marketing."
</p>

<p>
	It makes no difference if your guess was right or wrong.
</p>

<p>
	You can even make the dumbest observations such as: "Hey, did you know you're sitting next to a palm tree? Did you bother to think about it's feelings? What if it hates when you sit so close next to it? What if you smell like a skunk to the palm tree? Why are you so inconsiderate? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />"
</p>

<p>
	This kinda stuff is gold, but you gotta train yourself to be this stupid.

	It's very hard to explain it. Such consciousness is totally outside of your ability to imagine.
</p>

<p>
	It's even hard for me to imagine it when I'm not in the peak of it.

<p>
	Automation is overblown. That isn't our top problem.
</p>

<p>
	If automation ever becomes a big deal and UBI becomes necessary, we can pass it rather quickly if people want it.
</p>

<p>
	The automation problem can be addressed in ways other than UBI for now.

	But that's the case even if you don't mandate it.

<p>
	Just because people are fools does not stop them from voting. Hardcore fools are excited to vote their fave fool into high office.

<p>
	Ultimately this problem is solved by a quality education system.

<p>
	You could make a movie about love. The movie has alreay been, but then it unfolds before your eyes for the first time in a linear sequence.

<p>
	A video game is a better metaphor since it allows freedom of choice which the movie does not.

<p>
	Of course it's important not to get complacent. Vote regardless of what you think the odds are.
</p>

<p>
	I think people will be super-excited to vote in 2020. More than ever. I know I am.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's biggest gift to our democracy will be to rouse people from their complacency about voting and following the news. Trumpism will lead to a whole generation of young people eager for bold progressive ideas. Republicans are going to turn off a whole generation of young people with their foolish support of Trump. They will be suffering the cost of that in the decades to come.
</p>

<p>
	Trump reveals the Republican's true colors. Which is a great thing. People like Mitt Romny & the Bushes have put too much lipstick on that pig. Now everyone sees the pig underneath the lipstick.
</p>

<p>
	Trump waltzed in the White House and basically just said, "Let's be shameless pigs." And most of the Republicans said, "Okay, I guess. We were sorta doing that anyway. But can't we put some lipstick on it? Without the lipstick it's too ugly to look at."
</p>

			When you say "I don't find Yang's policies to be progressive enough," what you really mean is that he doesn't display the progressive ethos or ideal you have in your mind. And this is the root of your ideology. It's not the policies themselves that draws you in like you claim, it's actually this fighting spirit or "populist revolution" attitude you believe Sanders to provide. You believe Sanders will provide the kick we need to get the gears turning. No matter how they turn, we just need them turning.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No. He is the most serious candidate in terms of specific policy reforms which America badly needs. He has the longest, most proven track record of being a visionary leader in terms of the progressive agenda (over 40 years). He has the passion, the vision, the right leadership style, the balls to take on the status quo, the insider experience in Washington necessary to understand how the system works, he has the largest grassroots donor base of anyone in the country, he has tangible policies, and he doesn't play games with identity politics.
</p>

<p>
	He has a lot of experience with how to deal with Republicans, Washington insiders, and media. He know exactly what to do and he can be trusted to do it (as long as his healthy holds up). He also has the best understanding of foreign policy of the Dem candidates.
</p>

<p>
	This is not about ideology.
</p>

<p>
	And it helps that he actually has a decent chance of winning. Yang's chances are very long. I don't want to give my support and money to someone who probably will not win. Yang might be a good choice in 2024 or 2028 when he has some more experience and name-recognition. This kind of thing needs to be built over time.

	I don't doubt that Yang or Bernie would beat Trump. Their biggest hurdle is beating the other Dems.

	I've split tested it. Doesn't matter what you write as long as you got the right profile pics. And if you don't, no amount of writing will help you.
</p>

<p>
	Try it yourself. Create a profile using some random handsome white tall masculine dude's pictures. Write nothing at all. Just say "Hi". Girls will come a flocking. Then try that with your crappy selfies. Crickets...
</p>

<p>
	Some guys have it SO easy online. You just need that classic look. Or very low standards. Of course if you're willing to sleep with absolutely anyone, you can get lucky.

<p>
	That's the beauty of Sanders, he will lead a populist revolution to publicly shame them and shift our entire culture. That's what's really needed. No progressive laws are gonna pass a Republican controlled Senate anyway. Republicans are not going to let Yang do anything and they will demonize him as a socialist.
</p>

<p>
	Meeting them half-way is what we've been doing for the last 40 years. Something new is needed.
</p>

<p>
	Also, your analogy between Malcolm X:Bernie, MLK:Yang is not right. MLK was a radical progressive socialist. So if anything Bernie is like MLK. Malcolm X was a militant ideologue which is not analogous to Bernie. Bernie is leading a progressive social movement just like MLK.

	I have. It's actually possible to zoom in with consciousness to the atomic level. But it's not a visual zoom. It's a consciousness zoom. Since atoms are imaginary anyhow, you don't need to zoom into them visually.

<p>
	Being successful and a leader in your field opens a lot of doors and opportunities.
</p>

<p>
	Once you get really good in your field and people start to know about you, women will naturally come your way. This is mostly because you have become more visible, not because they want your money.
</p>

<p>
	But still, I wouldn't rely on this strategy exclusively. If you're a computer nerd working in your basement 12 hours a day, no women will ever find you no matter how good you are. You gotta start being visible publicly.
</p>

<p>
	The key is being more social. And getting good in your field can help you to increase your socialness.
</p>

<p>
	Why do rockstars get laid every night? Because they are visible to 10,000 people every night. Not because there's anything special about playing music. Although girls love music because it boosts their emotional state, so that does help. Music is like a drug.
</p>

<p>
	Or, you could just increase your socialness by going out every night and being social. Waiting for women to come to you is indirect.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	But I feel he's way too stuck on UBI as his signature policy to the point to being a one-note candidate.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, a candidate has to be evaluated holistically, taking into account every thing, including their experience with politics and government.
</p>

<p>
	Yang's biggest upside, in my mind, is his authenticity. But I don't consider his policies progressive enough.
</p>

<p>
	UBI could easily be dismantled by conservatives in the future and hurt the welfare state.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you're welcome to vote for whoever you like best. I got nothing against Yang. He's a cool guy and if he wins I will vote for him.

</p>

<p>
	Non-existence isn't real, it is imaginary!
</p>

<p>
	There is only existence. Existence is an Absolute and has no opposite.
</p>

<p>
	A non-existent object is actually an existent object in your imagination. But you are misunderstanding that object's true nature. You take it as really non-existent when it is actually existent as a thought. Your mind confuses thoughts and objects. For example, you confuse thoughts of your mother for your mother.
</p>

<p>
	The kicker is, if you didn't create this confusion you couldn't have a mother. Since a mother is a thought, not an object.
</p>

<p>
	So how are you gonna escape this confusion? Escaping it would mean the collapse of your entire reality. Can you stomach that?
</p>

<p>
	We have had decades of inaction.
</p>

<p>
	Sanders is just the kick in the ass we need. Of course he won't be able to pass everything he wants. But he will lead a movement that will shift the overtone window seriously left, which is what we have been lacking for 50 years.
</p>

<p>
	Sanders could be the next FDR. If only he was younger.
</p>

<p>
	Working class people, even Republicans will like Bernie as he pushes against elites.
</p>

<p>
	The ones who hate Bernie are mostly elites.
</p>

<p>
	A working class person is not going to hate Bernie.
</p>

<p>
	FDR was the most popular president of all time. But the elites hated him. I predict a similar sitation if Bernie wins.
</p>

<p>
	Of course hardcore conservatives will demonize him. But they demonized Obama, so there is no pleasing them.
</p>

<p>
	Fox News will demonize no matter who the Democratic president is.

<p>
	It's very simple: is your birth happening right now? No? Then you are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	If you object, "Yeah, but at one time it really was happening", just notice that you are imagining that too.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot ever escape imagination. If a thing is not being imagined right now, it doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple. You just don't want to accept it because you want things to be "real".
</p>

<p>
	Everything is imaginary, including brains, atoms, planets, science, logic, and your life.
</p>

<p>
	Brains seem to exist from your POV because that is what you're stuck imagining without being aware that you are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness imagines a brain. Your entire paradigm is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to zoom into it. It is already nothing as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Form is nothing. Don't go hunting for nothing. Nothing is everywhere. You are like a fish hunting for water.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, space is not nothing, it is something. But since something is ultimately nothing, space is also nothing.
</p>

<title>Iraq, A Dead Democracy On The Verge Of Collapse</title>

<p>
	Of course you can't upgrade the level of development of an entire country by several stages in 15 years.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless you guys are making progress. You got to work out those tribal differences and learn the value of pluralistic democracy which tolerates minority rights. Learning that less will take you guys 50-100 years, but you gotta start wherever you're at. It's not like the Saddam situation was sustainable. Eventually he would have died of natural causes, his sons would have been even worse than him, and there would be a bloody revolution to overthrown them. So the US invasion only hastened the inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	Forcing people to vote is still better than no voting at all.
</p>

<p>
	Even in America 50% of people don't vote.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not so bad. Things will get better.
</p>

<p>
	Is anyone really confused that religion and spirituality are closely related topics?
</p>

<p>
	A bigger problem is how seldom people see the similarity between religion and science.

We have many words for everything, and each one has slight nuances. Nuance is important.
</p>

<p>
	To call Actualized.org religion would be inappropriate. To call it spirituality is more appropriate, although limited.

<title>Online Dating</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Online dating requires above average looks, REALLY good professional profile photos (no selfies), and massive volume.
</p>

<p>
	Online dating requires serious work. You don't just put up a profile and start getting dates. You gotta game it more than real life.
</p>

<p>
	Online girls are screening you almost entirely on looks because they have nothing else to go by. Your personality has no chance to charm them. In real life you can hit much higher outside your league with charm and boldness. This cannot be done online. The girl has to decide whether she will sleep with you purely based on your profile photo in 1 second.
</p>

<p>
	If you're turning online because you're too lazy to do it in real life, chances are your results will be bad. Laziness is not a viable strategy for finding attractive females.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a classically handsome appearance, you can do well online. If not...
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, there's much more to reforming government than a single proposal like UBI.
</p>

<p>
	UBI vs jobs guarantee is like 7th on the list of important issues.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful about turning into a single-issue voter. A politician must considered holistically, not on the basis of one cool proposal.

<p>
	Religion is just spirituality turned into unquestioned ideology.
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean spirituality is free of dogma or ideology. Just that religion is much, much worse.
</p>

<p>
	Religion is what you call it when spirituality has turned into a cancer of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Corruption is like water, it seeps into every crack.

	The TV screen is not Mario and it is Mario.

	If Mario dies, the TV screen is untouched.

	Your human form is like Mario. Your God-Self is the TV screen.

</p>

<p>
	People who clearly speak of things they have no understanding of as if they do, will be banned from this forum. So just keep that in mind. This is not a place where ignorant opinions can be aired with impunity.
</p>

<p>
	If you're going to speak about infinity or God, first understand what you are talking about. It's very clear when someone speaks of these things without any direct experience of them.
