<p>
	This is a self-improvement forum.
</p>

<p>
	The idea is to, like, improve yourself, rather than making up excuses for why you can't.
</p>

<p>
	Change yourself so girls want you. This idea never even occured to your brilliant scientists.
</p>

<p>
	Self-improvement is a non-zero sum game. It makes no difference what the others guys are doing. Just improve yourself.
</p>

<p>
	There are millions of single women just waiting for a great guy to come along. A great guy is not born, he is self-made.
</p>

	If you live in the UK then the best place for pickup is obviously London.
</p>

<p>
	Look, all the best cities will be pricier than living in a village.
</p>

<p>
	There are tons of great big cities in Europe for game. It's more a function of where you are allowed to go, where you wanna live, and what nationality of girl you like.
</p>

<p>
	London is probably one of the best places in the world for game.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Easy. Shadow is sorta just the inverse of ego. Anything you think that isn't you and should not exist.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you think rapists should not exist, that's your shadow. You fail to accept that you are all the rapists in the world. This denial of rape is ego. It comes from fear, not Love.
</p>

<p>
	If you were infinitely conscious you would realize and accept that you are a rapist, thereby healing the division between you and the rapey part of reality. The rapey part of reality is your shadow. It's that part of yourself which you have disowned in order to maintain an ego.
</p>

			Yes, but the timeline of events doesn't suggest it was. The story as presented does not fit in with his methadone being adulterated with fentanyl to a significant degree or at all, as one would not expect him to wake up 2 hours later un-befuddled.

<p>
	If he got it on the black market, it could easily be diluted with fentanyl.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like to get a legal prescription requires that one be an opioid addict, which, if this guy was, is the source of the problem.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt you can just go to a doctor and say, "Hey, I'm having trouble sleeping, could you give me some methodone?"
</p>

<p>
	The only folks I know who get legal methodone are hardcore heroin addicts in rehab clinics. But I could be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	If this dude was an addict, all bets are off. He could have all sorts of drugs in his system. We really need to know his history of drug use.

<p>
	DMT has a very distinct appearance, texture, smell, and feel.
</p>

<p>
	Vape a tiny amount of it and smell it and feel it.
</p>

<p>
	Using a test kit you can easily identify if the powder is a psychedelic vs something else. If it is a psychedelic then it's hard to go wrong with a small dose.

<p>
	A shadow is any aspect of yourself/Universe which you demonize, judge, and hate because you think it is not your self.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you hate Nazis, you are not conscious that you are actually hating your own self.
</p>

<p>
	Well, JP has done that with stage Green. He is waging a war on himself without realizing it. And it kills him inside.

<p>
	Start with 10mg
</p>

<p>
	10mg of basically any tryptamine will not kill you and will rarely produce a super strong trip.
</p>

<p>
	10mg is a safe starting point for plugging almost anything.

<p>
	In the end you NEVER know. Which is why every chem has to be tested with tiny amounts to start.
</p>

<p>
	The nice thing with vaping is that you can take tiny puffs and slowly dial up. But still, a cocky noob could mess this up by taking a giant rip.

<p>
	Vaping itself will not be lethal unless something else is wrong, but vaping will surely amplify any errors.
</p>

<p>
	Stopping breathing from plugging is just realistically not gonna happen. It's not so rapid or intense. Vaping a large dose can cause breathing problems because a large vaped dose will hit you like a sledgehammer and multiply any complications by 5x.
</p>

<p>
	It ought to be something more than just vaping to kill you. Unless for some rare genetic anomoly.
</p>

<p>
	It would help to know if this guy had ever done 5-MeO or DMT before and how he handled it.

<p>
	If DMT and 5-MeO dosages were confused AND he had other stuff still in his system like methadone, that might be enough.
</p>

<p>
	Or it might be a problem with adulterants in the substance depending on how he sourced it.
</p>

<p>
	Very unfortunate to hear.
</p>

<p>
	But he was taking methadone?? Isn't that like heroin? How did he source it? If it was not from a good source it might have contained fentanyl which is very lethal.
</p>

<p>
	It does not make sense that a single hit of 5-MeO-DMT would kill a man. And what was the dose? Was it really 5-MeO or something else? More info needed before drawing conclusions.
</p>

<p>
	To stop breathing on 5-MeO would require a big dose and she should have been able to help him regain breathing if he stopped.
</p>

<p>
	An important precaution is to always start very low and gradually ramp up. And really, plug it instead of vaping.
</p>

	On the one hand it's admirable.
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand, to spend that much time developing a theory which is fundamentally false is a tragedy. And really that is his biggest problem: he is lost in his thinking mind. If I did what he did, I would go fucking insane. It would be very mentally unhealthy.

			You know, big part of the reason I started with pickup is to able to be myself around other people in general and to express myself fully. To not walk in this stiffled state all the time. Other thing with this approach is, what happens once I stop with approaching girls? When I get a girl friend or a wife? I would expect my confidence will go down quite a bit.

<p>
	It doesn't matter. Pickup will increase your social confidence permanently across the board. You will become better at talking to strangers, barbers, taxi drivers, clerks, shopkeepers, etc.

	RSD's original live Hotseat weekend seminars were definitely worth the $300.
</p>

<p>
	The live footage blows your mind open as far as what you imagine is possible in game.
</p>

<p>
	Although a lot of the game is deliberately flashy and not really as practical as less flashy methods. But still that flashy game can build up your confidence and balls.
</p>

<p>
	The original Hotseat helped me grow the balls to do some ballsy direct approaches which was important in my development.

<p>
	JP does have some sophisticated and important ideas. His psychological insights are usually valid.
</p>

<p>
	It's mostly his anti-Green politics that are the problem.

It could be nice to have that degree in your pocket when applying for some jobs.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, if you definitely know that your LP and future career will not have anything to do with law, then it's probably a formality and a waste of time and money. 7 months is a lot of time that you could invest into your LP.
</p>

<p>
	A lack of degree is not going to keep you from success in your LP if you're truly serious and passionate about it. At worst it will be a minor annoyance.
</p>

<p>
	If you're super-limited by finances then maybe go for the degree if you will need it to get your first job and hold you over. But if your finances allow it, I would shoot directly for your LP.
</p>

<p>
	That sunk cost effect is a bitch.
</p>

<p>
	One thing I can tell you for sure, your heart will glow the moment you stop doing law and your passion and motivation will flourish. There's nothing that weight the heart down more than doing projects that you know hold zero meaning for you.
</p>

	Nope! That means you aren't fully awake. You obviously don't see it.

<p>

<p>
	Of course there's nothing outside of God's perspective.
</p>

<p>
	You need to become so fucking conscious that even the notion of multiple perspectives collapses. There are not multiple perspectives. There is only one perspective.
</p>

<p>
	You see the problem? You are constructing all of "reality" and yet you're trying to treat this as though there is some reality outside your constructions. But how would it come to exist unless you constructed it?
</p>

<p>
	Nothing can exist unless you fool yourself into believing it does. That's how stuff comes into existence! Stop taking existence for granted. Stuff doesn't just exist all by itself. It only exists in the mind of God (YOU).
</p>

<p>
	You're not gonna understand this without psychedelics.

<title>Psychotherapy for improving my social life?</title>

<p>
	Personally I haven't gotten any self-esteem boost from mindfulness meditation. It's just not designed for that.
</p>

<p>
	I think therapy can be positive if you have some childhood trauma which sources your low self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
	I'd say the #1 solution to this problem is going out regularly, socializing regularly, and taking to attractive girls regularly so that you feel them getting attracted to you. As you attract more of them you will start to feel better about yourself and develop some confident and shatter some limit beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	The #2 solution is psychedelics, which are far more powerful than any therapy at getting you to truly love yourself. Basically, psychedelics will do what therapy does but 100x deeper, faster, and cheaper. But they will be more emotionally taxing and challenging because you'll be accomplishing more work in less time.
</p>

<p>
	You won't understand what true self-love or self-acceptance is until you do some psychedelics. No therapist can explain you this because they themselves don't have it or know it.
</p>

<p>
	It simply won't work and I told him that. The women will just get addicted and attached to the feelings of love, and these will be feelings of conditional love, not Absolute Love with detachment. And then they will get their heart broken as those attachments necessarily shatter. He thinks these women will be able to maintain a sort of enlightened detachment -- but of course they won't. Not even close, because they would first need to do 10 years of consciousness work for that even be thinkable.
</p>

<p>
	It's not like this hasn't been tried in the past with disaterous consequences. But Connor believes he can do it better and avoid all the traps because he is here to awaken the world through materialistic means.

<p>
	Connor has a sort of blind optimism where he feels that he can do no wrong and everything will just work out as long as his intentions are good.
</p>

<p>
	I am not so optimistic about human nature.
</p>

<p>
	He believes that as long as one is "fully awake" then one can do no wrong, and if one does wrong then one is not "fully awake".
</p>

<p>
	Of course I have always taught the exact opposite of that. No matter how awake you are, self-deception and devilry is always luring right around the corner. No amount of awakening will save you from mistakes and wrong-doing. That requires extreme vigilance, which he doesn't care too much about. Hence evil will happen. But he disagrees.

<p>
	Spirituality is a long process. Best to pace yourself and focus on doing the daily practices diligently.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind will go through hundreds and even thousands of highs, lows, states, reactions, backlashes, opinions, stories, fantasies, etc. over the years of practice. Don't get too wrapped up in that. Keep your eye on the ball.

	Please note: while Connor can do as he likes on his own channels, this forum will not be used for outrageous clickbait, drama, and other such self-promotional games. I am not going to be giving publicity to people who engage in deliberate attention-whoring or who give spirituality or psychedelics an unhinged look for the sake of clicks.
</p>

<p>
	My general rule is to not engage with response videos or attention-seekers.

<p>
	Well, I had a good long conversation with Connor and we discussed plenty of traps involved in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Overall he's a lot more reasonable than he appears in his zany videos. His videos are overly dramatic for views and clicks. I'm not concerned for his mental health. He seems stable and happy and he has a pretty good grasp of nonduality. The only concern besides the image problems he creates for himself is some of the bold plans he has for teaching people awakening via Tantric sex, which I think is not gonna be effective and will be ripe for hurt/abuse. We've discussed the dangers and he's aware of my concerns but ultimately it's his business and it has nothing to do with what I teach. His and my styles and standards for teaching are very different. He likes a flamboyant and dramatic approach. I explained to him the dangers of that. He is open to feedback but also a firm believer in his approach and techniques.
</p>

<p>
	Connor's a decent guy from what I can tell and perhaps in 5 or 10 years he will make a solid teacher as his style matures. He's quite young and cocky so of course the maturity is still lacking, but that's to be expected for someone his age.
</p>

<p>
	We had little disagreement on the substance of nonduality or God. Our differences lie in style, attitude, and values. What he learned from me is not the style but some metaphysical and epistemic articulations which helped him make sense of his psychedelic awakening experiences.
</p>

<p>
	He was enjoyable to talk to. I wish him well.
</p>

<p>
	Stan Grof wrote entire books about "spiritual emergencies" and "spiritual crises".
</p>

<p>
	This is very, very common in the spiritual world. If you're going to practice hardcore spirituality you will almost certainly face a spiritual emergency at some point if you go deep enough. Many people don't go deep enough so they don't understand. And this is not exclusive to psychedelics. Hardcore meditation can be just as challenging.
</p>

<p>
	Smoke enough salvia and you'll have a spiritual emergency, I promise. Salvia will scare the living daylight out of you. It will wipe away your whole reality within seconds and you will cry for mommy like a little girl. And there will be no mercy with salvia. It will not treat you with kid gloves like some other psychedelics. Just as you're begging for mercy it will rip your face off.
</p>

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	The kind of insight I'm talking about is a total state of awakening and infinite consciousness that you become. It's nothing that can ever be mistaken and it cannot be validated or invalidated by any other human.
</p>

<p>
	When you become infinitely conscious -- that's it. You are more conscious than any of these gurus and teachers. You are equally conscious to God. You ARE God. The end. All gurus and teachings become a joke. Become so conscious that every guru looks like an idiot.
</p>

<p>
	You are God. Don't let any fool convince you otherwise. They have no clue what God means. God is not merely no-self. And God is not merely some void. These are all inferior and reductionistic nondual understandings. They are not as high or as deep as God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	Do not stop until you hit INFINITY.
</p>

<p>
	Not necessary.
</p>

<p>
	You can practice physical escalation at the club on random girls.
</p>

<p>
	Physical game is a huge part of learning game. Practice it for a few months at a busy nightclub and you'll get pretty good.

		<p>
			A few years ago I was in a club with friends. We had very pure MDMA crystals which we eyeballed (I know it was incredibly stupid), it was for sure the highest dose I ever took, just unimaginable euphoria, might even be on the edge of serotonin syndrome. So we took it + a few shots of vodka before entering the club and in the club as well. So here I was dancing on the most disinhibiting drug combo imaginable MDMA and drunk. A girl started to grind on my dick, I backed up in crippling fear, she looked back at me and smiled, she was very persistent trying to do that a few more times yet my fear managed to cripple me completely. Essentially my inhibitions were too high even on super drug combo, what chances do I have sober? After that night I let go of even trying at all to get girls because I thought that unless I will get some amygdala removal surgery, there's no way for me to ever get pussy.

	Women get upset when guys hurt women. But women don't give a fuck when women hurt guys.

	Self-bias 101

<p>
	I'm not judging. Just saying how it tends to work. Of course guys also generally don't care when they hurt women. The not-caring is so profound that neither sex is even aware of it.

<p>
	Go out and talk to girls.
</p>

<p>
	You're making this too complicated with your horrible inner game.
</p>

<p>
	The proper inner game is this: Stop thinking and GO OUT AND TALK TO GIRLS!
</p>

<p>
	I used to be very insecure. Until I started going out and hot girls slowly started to get attracted to me. That changed my inner game because you can't believe "I'm not good looking enough" once a hot girl is eager to suck your dick.
</p>

<p>
	If you talk to 100s of girls you will notice that a few of them really love you. It's a numbers game.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe you can't, then you can't. If you believe you can, then you can. Be ware of how your mind constructs reality.

<p>
	Sex is a taboo topic in all societies. But last time I checked, all societies fuck like rabbits.
</p>

<p>
	In more conservative societies you just gotta keep it more concealed.

			With that logic you can rationalize everything, i am not judging you but there should be a balance between being a decent person and good in game. You can just talk to the girls that are single and worst case talk to girls in relationships but just attract them, so you can practice attraction skills, not actually get physical with them.

<p>
	That's right, anything can be rationalized.
</p>

<p>
	I don't date non-single girls nor do I recommended it. Like I said, I was pushing the envelope in that case to see how game works. Sometimes in life you gotta push the envelope to see where the boundaries are. Dating is an arena which is full of collateral damage and hurt feelings. This is something to learn and accept about dating. Which is not to say you should use this as license to cheat and hurt people needlessly.
</p>

<p>
	One time I flirted with a married woman just to see how far she would go. Her husband was a well-known guy in Vegas. She went pretty far. Don't forget that not all women are angels.

	Believe it or not, there is value to a conservative attitude towards life. Although of course there's much stupidity within American conservative ideology.

	Be good, if you want. Be bad if you want. Either way is Good.

	It may be wiser to invest this time working on some other area of your life, freeing up time for when the masks go away.

<p>
	For all you spiritual types, the idea of sitting around and waiting for tens of millions of other people to take the vaccine out of some silly fears isn't a very good sign of your leadership or collective responsibility. Your tiny bit of fear, blown way out of all proportion, will costs thousands of lives.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it like this, when you grandparents were called to go fight and die in WWII, they did it. Yet when you are asked to take a virtually harmless vaccine to save the lives of thousands, you fear it like a bullet to the head and act like a selfish jackass.
</p>

<p>
	Indeed, how entitled and pussified stage Green has become. This whole topic should go into the stage Green cringe compilation thread.
</p>

<p>
	Where is the conscious leadership? I see very little.

<p>
	There's nothing horrifying about a void. If you're experiencing horror, that's obviously an egoic emotional reaction and NOT void.
</p>

<p>
	The Void is meaningless. Which means it cannot be bad. And in fact, it is Love, since its a perfect Unity.

	I mean, yeah, of course we can all get needy sometimes and develop a crush, but what's the solution? It's not like you're gonna make it work. The solution is to talk to other girls so you don't feel the crippling scarcity.

<p>
	Totally different. Neediness is not so repulsive in women, although it can also get annoying after a while. A needy girl will get used and abused. Her neediness is a problem more for herself than the guy.

What do you expect? You deserve to be friendzoned.
</p>

<p>
	By 3 hours your hands should be on her ass.
</p>

<p>
	On dates you gotta keep things light, playful, and lots of physical touching. And you gotta bounce around to multiple locations. Don't just sit in one place for 3 hrs.

<p>
	I tell it like it is.
</p>

<p>
	This was 8 years ago. I was in training and my job was to push every set to its breaking point.
</p>

<p>
	If this offends you, oh well. You don't really understand women until you see how far you can push it.
</p>

<p>
	Women are not as innocent as they'd like to have you believe. If she really loved her boyfriend she would have never agreed to go on a date with me.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about tact. It's about showing guys what's possible and how to overcome excuses. An important part of game is getting over all your limiting beliefs about what's possible.
</p>

<p>
	I tell you some brutal aspects of game to toughen you guys up cause ya'll are a bunch of sissies up in here.

<p>
	Omg, man, you gotta move on to other girls. This is needy as fuck and it repels chicks.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta bite the bullet and cure your neediness by talking to lots of girls and never falling into this kind of neediness again.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't love, it's just a crush and it is meaningless. There are tons of other girls. As soon as you get this needy with one, you're done. It's dead forever. You killed it before it even began. Even if she magically slept with you, nothing good or healthy would come of it.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is, no girl is that special. She only seems that special to you because you're so needy.
</p>

<p>
	The feminine generally values feelings over truth.
</p>

<p>
	Although of course Love and Truth are identical.
</p>

<p>
	The feminine will care more about not hurting your feelings than telling you the cold hard truth.

			Ive been deeply in this stage now for about 5 years and it feels confusing. It feels like I can't ever know the answers to what I want with my life because everything is relative. Here are some examples or the way my mind works -  Do I want a girlfriend or not? Well maybe I do but can I believe my thoughts maybe they are all self deceptions. Maybe the idea of a self deception is a deception.
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe just drop all these concepts. Should I keep the job I have now? My life is passing me by but what is time? What about all these concerns? They are just thoughts in the mind. Should I focus on them and make choices or let life flow naturally? I can observe my thoughts which often makes the thoughts disperse but i still need to make decisions.   I basically just come up with questions without any answers which just becomes confusing. I remember Leo talked about this in his 9 stages of ego development in the Pluralistic stage. Ive been here for a while and it seems confusing that there are no answers or concretes. 
		</p>

		<p>
			For a lot of my stage orange friends they don't have these problems. They just fall into life which they haven't designed for themselves settle find a job and a girl and seem content.
		</p>

		<p>
			Can anyone relate to this or have any comments?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, of course. That's the cost of grappling with relativity. Which is why most people suck at understanding relativity. There is a  period in your life that you must pass through where you feel lost in relativity and unable to make a decision as a result.
</p>

<p>
	I had a plan to shoot a video about this.
</p>

<p>
	But I already talked about the solution to some extent in my much under-rated video: Balancing Theory vs Practice

			If i did that shit in my city they would be like wtf leave me alone. Probably would be with headphones and even if they were not it would be quite weird and annoying.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	One time I was at the gym working out. Saw hot girl walk onto the treadmill to run. She was wearing headphones.
</p>

<p>
	As she's running, I walk up in front of her and do a big grin and a big wave. I motion for her to take off her headphones and get off the treadmill. She complies. I tell her she's cute and start chatting her up. She tells me she has a boyfriend. I grab her number anyway. We go on a date. We make out. Her boyfriend was out of town and she was feeling lonely.
</p>

<p>
	Another time hot girl (25) is walking through the mall talking on her phone. I run in front of her, stop her, and ask her who she's talking to. She says her mom. I tell her to hang up on her mom and talk to me instead. She complies. We flirt and exchange numbers. Then we go on a date and have great sex. Stunning girl.
</p>

<p>
	I once met a guy who banged something like 100 women at the mall. He would fuck them in the dressing room.
</p>

<p>
	STOP. MAKING. EXCUSES.
</p>

<p>
	Women are everywhere. Go talk to them.

<p>
	You see, the way this game works is that my work will be demonized to the point that it has no impact on larger cultural. Which is exactly how a devil treats truth. All a devil has to do to win the battle against truth is to smear the truth with his own shit.

</p>

<p>
	This is what happens when arrogant and ignorant people start judging spiritual people. An ignorant person cannot see "mahasamdhi", he can only see murder. He cannot see siddhis, he can only see delusion. Because anything outside his paradigm is either insane, delusional, criminal, or evil.
</p>

<p>
	If Adeptus careful listened to my epistemological teachings he might understand the traps he's falling into with his rash judgments and moralizations. It's a basic error of failing to account for the relativity of perspectives.

			I'm not sure if Logically I think she's better than me. I think it has to do with some deep down karma of my ego. It's just my hurted ego. Deep down I know I'm cool as fuck, thanks to Spirituality . But old conditionings keep doing this growth so freaking slow. As you said, the fact that I'm not approaching doesn't help either. Until I really approach I assume I won't really change do my conditionings will remain the same I guess.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Simply make a rule that if you see a really hot girl, you MUST approach no matter how cringe.
</p>

<p>
	The funny thing about really hot girls is that very few guys have the balls to directly approach them.
</p>

<p>
	One time a saw an absurdly hot girl at Qdoba eating her food alone at a little round table. So I got my food and just sat down right at her little table like I was her boyfriend and started eating my food and talking about myself. She told me she had a dick (shit test). I told her I LOVE dick (passed shit test). Eventually she asked me to take her number.
</p>

<p>
	No one has the balls to do that kind of thing and it comes off extremely attractive.
</p>

<p>
	The girl turned out to be a nude model. She got fake tits, but they weren't big enough for her liking, so she went back to get them even bigger, twice! <img alt="xD" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/laugh.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/laugh@2x.png 2x" title="xD" width="20" /> <img alt="O.o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/blink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/blink@2x.png 2x" title="O.o" width="20" /> <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Or, I could have been like you and never approached, eating my food alone in quiet desperation, feeling shitty about myself all day.
</p>

<p>
	The difference between a winner's mindset and a victim's mindset is a set of perfectly shaped tits in your hands <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />

<p>
	Whatever the technical reasons, Sadhguru almost killed himself (by his own admission) and when he went to doctors they ran tests on him and told him that he should be dead. It took him a long time to recover and heal.

	By any conventional standard the practices Sadhguru did would be considered suicidal. His own wife committed spiritual suicide for fuck's sake.

You are completely skirting the point.
</p>

<p>
	I am merely re-stating what Sadhguru himself has said publicly. If you dispute these claims, take it up with him.

<p>
	3 suggestions:
</p>

<p>
	1) Build a rock solid confidence that if you continue doing this work diligently one day you'll realize the Truth. I have been doing this work seriously for about 6 years now and it has never even crossed my mind that I will fail. Because I care about Truth too much to even entertain such a possibility. Don't allow failure to be an option.
</p>

<p>
	2) Don't listen to your mind when it tries to stop you. Practice a bit each day. I spent many years of just doing 30 minutes or 60 minutes of daily meditation practice while going about my business life. You can easily make 30-60 mins a day of looking at your hand. This work is a slow burn. You must pace yourself for a decade of practice. It will pay off, but not immediately.
</p>

<p>
	3) Try to enjoy it. Enjoy just sitting and being conscious. Enjoy meditation. Enjoy looking at your hand. Life does not get any better than sitting and looking at your hand. Spiritual work is not about getting somewhere. It's about enjoy the present moment more and more. The only place you're trying to get to with spiritual work is RIGHT HERE, RIGHT NOW. THIS! THIS! THIS! THIS! THIS. IS. IT.

<p>
	Dude, you have no clue what hell and ungrounded states people like Tolle, Sadhguru, or Mooji went through in their awakening process.
</p>

<p>
	If any of these people live-streamed their entire spiritual journey, you would think of them as insane lunatics. With these old-ass gurus you're only seeing the end result of a 30 or 40 year process. Connor is showing you a bit of the actual process for a young, arrogant, materialistic guy like himself.
</p>

<p>
	Did you know that Peter Ralston used to jump off a rooftop and make his students catch him, otherwise he would kill himself if they did not? Did you know that Sadhguru handled pounds of raw mercury in the building of his temple in India which probably gave him terrible mercury poisoning that almost killed him? Did you know that Tolle was suicidally depressed and on the verge of killing himself? Did you know that Shinzen Young was a hardcore drug addict?
</p>

<p>
	Imagine THAT live-streamed.
</p>

<p>
	Exactly.
</p>

<p>
	It's beyond foolish to judge another's spiritual journey in the way that Adeptus does.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Interesting framing.
</p>

<p>
	So if I supported Connor Murphy, I would be a monster enabling a false god. And if I say that he's going down the road of Zen devilry, then it is "strange" and I'm also to blame for creating him. Even though I have an entire video explaining the dangers of Zen devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Heads I win, tails you lose.
</p>

<p>
	My teachings are not an ideology and being God is not an ideology. I have no idea what Connor Murphy is doing and I have never endorsed whatever he's doing. Until a few weeks ago, I had no idea he even watches me. And just cause he watches a few of my videos means nor says nothing. You have no idea who else he might be following, what books he might be reading, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's also not a good idea to judge Connor's psychological state too much. He's clearly going through a spiritual process, which he is recording live, so of course it will not look stable or "proper" the way that people expect.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, if Eckhart Tolle live-streamed his awakening as it happened, everyone would be saying that Tolle has lost his mind and needs professional help. There's no reason why Connor cannot stabilize and become a solid teacher some years down the road once he gets some of the Zen devilry out of his system.
</p>

<p>
	Nobody is born as a solid spiritual master. You become a master by going through decades of trail and error and spiritual mistakes.
</p>

<p>
	Judging Connor's process is not very wise. Let the man go through whatever he needs to go through. Connor is recording the actual process of waking up. It's a brutal process. I experience similar pushback from people when I release raw, unedited videos of my process. Any deviation from propriety is ridiculed and judged. People expect you to be like Eckhart Tolle or Sadhguru, all happy and calm. Which is a joke.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I have no interest any more in releasing raw, honest footage of my own process. People will just ridicule it and not understand. People don't want raw honesty, they want fake spiritual perfection.
</p>

<p>
	As far as the theatrics, gimmickry, and business schemes that Connor engages in -- none of that aligns with my teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I should say, this Adeptus guy is strawmanning the shit out of my spiritual realizations. I have never claimed to be any kind of messiah nor have I ever claimed that I can heal all of mankind through miracles. His portrayal of my insights is basically slander.
</p>

<p>
	Everything I said in my spiritual videos is still true:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I am God (but so are you)
	</li>
	<li>
		I have been more conscious than most spiritual teachers or gurus
	</li>
	<li>
		Psychic abilities are real
	</li>
	<li>
		Healing is real and possible, although of course it is not a power the ego controls and it will not magically heal the whole world. When I spoke about these powers I clearly said this is still something I'm exploring and struggling to develop.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These claims are not so crazy. Any serious spiritual practitioner understands that claims #1, #3, and #4 are obviously correct. They might dispute claim #2, but, oh well, that's just a common spiritual dispute that every spiritual person has at some point.
</p>

<p>
	I have not backtracked on any "psychic superpower nonsense" because siddhis are not nonsense -- they are a well-known aspect of spiritual work which has existed among serious spiritual practitioners since the dawn of time. What's nonsense is Adeptus' absurd strawmanning of a guy who mentions siddhis. That is coming from a place of arrogance,  ignorance, and closedmindedness. I have in fact NEVER claimed to have supernatural powers. But I know people who do and I know they can be developed by certain people (not even necessarily me). My work and teachings have NEVER been about supernatural powers or showing off in the manner of Connor Murphy.
</p>

<p>
	Adeptus misunderstand what happened with me. It's not that I backed off of anything I said. It's simply that when I said those things I discovered states of consciousness that virtually no human has ever accessed and I said things in a raw fashion as part of showing people the raw work that I was in the middle of doing. But when I show raw work like that, people now expect me to be unhinged forever, but of course, in fact I'm very well grounded and they are shocked when they see me come back the next week or month and record very grounded videos, taking this to mean that I'm contradicting myself when in fact I've just integrated the raw realizations from before -- as you're supposed to do.
</p>

<p>
	The thing to understand is this: When I show a video of a raw awakening or a post-retreat debrief, I'm not in a fully grounded state (of course), and this is shown to the viewer specifically to give you a taste of what this work feels like because otherwise the viewer gets the false impression that this work is always grounded and that I am some stoic, emotionless, autistic robot. Out of 300+ of my grounded videos, Adeptus cherrypicks 2 raw live awakening videos and a pre-retreat and post-retreat video that came after an intense 30 straight days of 5-MeO-DMT, to demonize my entire teaching and build his biased narrative. Watch the other 300+ videos for context. And if you dare, let's see how your first video will look after 30 straight days of 5-MeO-DMT breakthroughs. I'll bet you'll be a bit emotional and glowing with insight. I sacrificed myself for the sake of psychedelic science and this is the shit I get from my fellow psychonaut? Not only do I get shit from non-psychonauts about this non-stop, now I have to deal with shit from psychonauts too?
</p>

<p>
	Adeptus, if you read this, please stop with your whiteknight routine. I know you mean well, but you're getting carried away with your good-guy act and you are unwittingly slandering my work. My work is more grounded than your rants, so please spare me the outrage. Connor Murphy is his own man and I am not responsible for whatever zany shit he decides to do. I will however email Connor and try to have a talk with him about the dangers of presenting these ideas to the public so that awakening, psychedelics, and "I am God" are not mis-perceived by the public. I very much care about that. Whether he will even listen to me is questionable. I am not his daddy and to frame me that way is irresponsible in and of itself. This guy is a total stranger to me. He's not any kind of formal student of mine. What you're doing is akin to someone watching your YouTube videos about psychedelics, taking a massive dose of 1000ug LSD, jumping out the window, killing himself, and then people blaming you for it because, hey, Adeptus told him that psychedelics are good, despite all the warnings you issued. That's exactly what you're doing to me in the name of playing a whiteknight with your moral outrage. Excuse me, but who died and made you the Pope of psychedelics? Just because someone has a different process than you with psychedelics that you disagree with does not make you right nor does it give you the moral high ground to judge them for it. You don't like me enjoying 5-MeO-DMT in a bathtub? You think that's dangerous? Well, that's just, like, your opinion, man. You have no clue of my actual situation when I did that.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are dangerous. Spiritual work is dangerous. I've always said that. In the hands of a fool psychedelics and/or spiritual work can get you killed. But the Truth is the Truth regardless. The Truth is, psychedelics can show you that you are God. And it doesn't matter how many people get killed, the Truth will always remain the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Also: Connor Murphy was NOT banned from the forum. Some of his posts were so self-promotional (promoting donations to his Patreon account) that our good Mods were right to moderate some of it. He is still free to post here and he has not contacted me personally for advice. If he did, I would gladly offer it. But I would never presume to go around telling another teacher or YouTuber how to run his business. I didn't give Connor advice because I didn't feel he would be receptive to it.
</p>

<p>
	All of the above is so obvious that I hardly feel it needs to be stated. I have never felt a need to state it until now, but now I'm forced to state it because clearly people like Adeptus got some really wrong ideas about my teachings and how spiritual development works and now I feel I have to publicly correct this slander and strawmanning. It's bad enough that my work is slandered by all sorts of ignorant noobs, materialists, and religious fundamentalists -- I expect that -- but when my work is slandered by a fellow psychonaut who should have a deep understanding of the trickeries of this work -- that leaves me disappointed. Since day one of my teachings I have always spoken out about the dangers and traps of psychedelics, spiritual work, ideology, cults, and self-deception. I have always steered people away from irresponsible use of psychedelics and Zen devilry.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is this: give a man some room to spiritually develop without breathing down his neck and telling him everything he's doing wrong. That is, if you're truly compassionate and care about his development. But if you want to create sensational YouTube rant videos, I guess that's another matter. But if you care about truth, be careful how your mind constructs convenient narratives to explain away stuff like what's going on with Connor Murphy. The bottom line is that you have no idea what he's going through and what the right process is for him.
</p>

<p>
	If you, Adeptus, ever want to correct the record, I'm more than happy to explain all this publicly with you. My work is grounded and it will always remain grounded and I will always condemn teachings and teachers which are ungrounded.
</p>

<p>
	But of course, there truly is no ground <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

	As annoying as JP is, he should be allowed publish his book. Just cause an employee does not like JP's ideas does not mean they get to cancel his book.

	It's not like JP is Hitler. His political ideas are pretty much standard conservative dogma.

<p>
	Meditation is a spiritual purification process. As you do it rigorously for years, the evil within you will slowly get purified. This process takes a lot of time.
</p>

<p>
	Fear being imaginary is the ultimate culmination of the spiritual purification process. It will take you a lot of work to reach that point. And to reach that point you'll be forced to confront your deepest fears, including the fear of death, insanity, torture, and whatever supernatural forces you fear.
</p>

<p>
	If you fear demons then you must face that fear and realize it is an illusion -- not the demons, but your fear of them.
</p>

<p>
	"Guru" is also a Hindu concept.
</p>

<p>
	But you got spiritual teachers in literally all cultures. You will not find a single culture in which spiritual masters don't exist.
</p>

<p>
	That's a pretty astounding fact when you think about it.

	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Oh the excuses the mind will concoct just to not approach a girl.
</p>

<p>
	IF you were great at being authentic around hot girls and approaching them consistently without fear, you would already be a master of pickup.
</p>

<p>
	But you ain't. Your game sucks balls, hence the existence of pickup.
</p>

<p>
	Med student: What if the only reason I'm going to med school is because I'm afraid I will kill someone with my lack of medical experience? If I was absolutely secure and confident in my ability to heal people, would I even be going to med school? Probably not.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. You also have a bunch of wrong ideas about what pickup is. It's not about tricking girls into sleeping with you.

Now i would assume these incels are small minority but these are the ones that make the channels that get all the views and stuff. Maybe they are lying about their efforts? Who knows? One of the most toxic ones i talked with said that he did 100 approaches and got rejected very harshly and it really hurt his ego and shit. I mean you said you did like 400 but 100 approaches, how many guys do 100 approaches honestly? Very few. I feel like there is SOME truth to the blackpill, maybe as much truth as there is to most toxic ideologies out there

<p>
	They simply have no idea how to approach nor how to close. Cold approach has an extremely steep learning curve. A guy indoctrinated with Incel/Black Pill ideology will have such horrible inner game that of course no woman will get attracted to him. He might as well rub a skunk on his face. That's what Incel ideology does to a man's attractiveness. And his outer game will suck just as much.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be talking to Nazis. They are less brainwashed than these Black Pill guys.
</p>

<p>
	The fact that you take these ideologies seriously is already the problem.

	It's just victim mentality, scapegoating, projection, denial, and all the other classic ego defense mechanisms that the ego employs when it is scared, hurt, and denied love.
</p>

<p>
	What's changed is that thanks to the internet and video games, lots of men have stopped socializing face-to-face, which makes getting laid impossible. An Incel is just a guy who doesn't socialize.

<p>
	Ego is not a thought or a group of thoughts. Ego is a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You can have an egoless state of consciousness with plenty of thoughts arising. Or you can have an egoic state of consciousness with no thoughts arising.
</p>

<p>
	If you are God, then thinking you are God is merely thinking about what is true, just like if you are a millionaire, thinking about yourself as a millionaire is perfectly natural.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is when you think you're a millionaire but you are dirt poor.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking you are a millionaire does not make you a millionaire, but thinking you are a millionaire when you are already a millionaire is only natural and it would in fact be insane to think of yourself as poor.

<p>
	A) You shouldn't be here reading these threads. These threads are not designed for you. You sit here reading this stuff and just build up an even bigger victim complex. If you don't want a player guy, there are millions of them around.
</p>

<p>
	B) You're way too negative about dating. You've developed a victim complex. Stop whining about it and go date some guys with an open mind. You foolishly waste dating opportunities and then bemoan how come you're alone and can't find the right guy. Dating requires positivity and openmindedness to meeting new people. Be ware of stereotyping guys without even getting to know them. You should have said YES, gotten a coffee with him, and gotten to know him.

		</p>

		<p>
			Going Meta fucked up my attraction for a while. I recognize I used to be more attractive when I was ignorant. I was full of self belief and arrogance. I dont regret it, cuz I prefer truth than girls. But, since you were about to start dating, I wonder how do you manage to stay attractive and fck with your mind and reality at the same time. I went very mentally and emotionally unstable with girls when I discovered pickup and tried to do both at the same time without having any idea of what I was getting into, lol. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't see what the problem is. Your spiritual work should only make you more attractive to girls. Girls love spiritual stuff.
</p>

<p>
	The only issue is that as I get more spiritual I have less interest in socializing or going to clubs. But you can push yourself past that if you want.

			Is your inner game genuine Leo? Sometimes I fear that my self-image/concept will never reach that ideal place of true confidence because my negative self-image is soooo deeply ingrained in my psyche. When I try to do all this subconscious reprogramming stuff and visualization, the most I get is this pseudo-confidence that masks my inner anxiety and insecurities. I just can’t seem tap into genuine and authentic change. Makes me want to resort to just changing the outer (more money, gym, better clothes, etc.)...

<p>
	It takes A LOT of work.
</p>

<p>
	And you have to approach a lot too. Just sitting at home is not gonna build your inner game. Inner game is built by approaching 1000s of girls and building a deep base of experiences, failures, and successes.

You are just being a high value guy.
</p>

<p>
	Brad Pitt does not need to tell anyone he dates that he's a player. But you know he ain't waiting around for you. If you want him, you better snap him up or he will find someone else.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing about this is ever explicitly said. It's all just part of being a high value guy. High value guys have lots of options and girls LOVE this. They want to snap him up.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you are looking for excuses to be needy with girls. You are setting your sights low because you don't see yourself as worthy of a hot girl. That's some bad inner game that you should work to fix.
</p>

<p>
	A 6/10 girl can have a shitty personality just like any girl can.

	It's a bit of curse, really.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get good at articulating ideas, you must articulate them all the time in your head, 24/7.
</p>

<p>
	It's not necessarily good for your peace of mind. But it's great for teaching.

<p>
	Girls are super flakey by their nature. There is no official relationship until there's been sex multiple times and she wants to get serious. Until then it's first come first serve. Don't sit around waiting for her. Go on with your life as usual.
</p>

<p>
	Do not act like you're exclusive with a girl while there hasn't even been sex yet. This is needy behavior. She should sense some threat that if she doesn't lock you down you will have plenty of options with other girls. Set up your attitude and lifestyle such that she feels that you are the type of guy who has plenty of options. That doesn't necessarily mean you will use all those options, but she should feel lucky that you choose her out of all your other options.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that high value men have lots of options and girls know it. Losers have no options and girls know that too.
</p>

<p>
	If she wants to lock you down, make her work a bit to do it, so that she can appreciate what she's getting.
</p>

<p>
	When I tell people that enlightenment requires 1000+ hours of work, I get criticized for being too limiting and negative. I have never made this work sound easy like many teachers do. I call it work because it requires work. Those who don't do the work will not understand what I teach and that is not my problem because 90%+ of people who listen to me will not do any of the work.

<p>
	Basically Modi is the right fit for India -- despite his nationalism. Most Hindus are deeply stuck in nationalistic stage Blue attitudes and will remain so for at least another few generations.

<p>
	It goes beyond any one example. Just the fact that reality is imaginary is my deepest love for reality. If reality was anything other than imaginary, I would be deeply disappointed at the stupidity of reality.
</p>

<p>
	The first time I realized reality was imaginary was the happiest day of my life. I said, "Thank God! Of course! Finally it makes sense."
</p>

<p>
	If reality was not imaginary it would be an insult to intelligence because then reality would be limited. But of course reality cannot be limited because there exists nothing outside of reality to limit it, and this is the greatest thing about reality.

<p>
	When have I ever said that our work here is about empty statements of you being God?
</p>

<p>
	This has nothing to do with my teachings.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not conscious that you are God, then do not claim you are God. Claim that you do not know what you are.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe you are human, then state so.
</p>

<p>
	When I tell you that you are God, I am telling you what you can become conscious of if you work at it. In the same way that if I tell you about Alaska that is so that you could one day visit Alaska for yourself. Believing that you are in Alaska while you are not is idiocy.

			The "bad" part of the trip: oh my god it was like nothing I ever experienced. It's like the line between imagination and reality was erased, and my imagination was reality. Reality would seamlessly shift and transform like my imagination would seamlessly shift and transform. For instance: my girlfriend was driving us home and I thought of watching one of Leo's youtube videos and that became my reality. My reality was the awareness of Leos video, and that reality was me. Leo would tell me to wake up and suddenly my reality would shift to pure colors and transform into taking with one of my friends. As I was trying to talk to my friend and tell them I need help because I don't know what's real or who I am, I suddenly KNEW that my friend was me and that there was no need to explain anything to him. That reality would then fractalize and I would travel through infinity and experience infinite cycles of knowing and forgetting the truth. I would then come back to this reality, but this reality was no longer real. I felt complete oneness with my experience and completely alone at the same time: like everything and everyone was merely something I was imagining and that I was the only real thing. Knowing that filled me with complete existential despair. I just wanted to die, but I knew that ceasing to be was impossible, that even if I died in the "real" reality, that "real" reality wasn't even real and wasn't me. That if I tried to kill myself in "real" life, it would merely be me imagining shooting myself in the head and continue shifting and transforming realities. These shifts and transformations in reality occurred for a good 6 hours and I felt completely alone, horrible, and eternally doomed.

And oh my god I just want this all to end. I can't handle what I experienced, I can't handle KNOWING that all of this reality is imagined and everyone else is just my imagination. I can't handle knowing that I am the only thing, that I am god, and that I am infinite. I just want it all to end, for me to disappear, but I know that's not possible because on the trip I've already disappeared in this reality.

<p>
	Of course it's all true, the only problem is that you jumped in too deep too fast and your ego isn't properly integrating it.

Its like I've peeled back the veil of reality and seen the truth, and the truth is infinite, alone, and despairing. I can now remember the trip whenever I want, but because I can remember how I felt and what I knew during that trip any notion of who I am and what is real has no ground. Everything feels fake and imaginary and I feel trapped in this hopeless meaningless ride of existence & nothingness. Everyone and everything in my life is just something I am imagining and I'm completely alone. I am in complete hell. The truth is complete hell. I want to end.

	You're not in hell, you're in heaven. Stop giving these experience negative meanings.

	Just take it easy, distract yourself with something fun, go enjoy nature or a TV show. After a few weeks these trips will leave your mind and you will calm down.

	All that happened here is you had a bad trip. Forget about it, walk it off, and in a month you will hardly remember it even happened.

<p>

	The only veil is the one materialists imagine.
</p>

<p>
	All of materialism is imaginary -- and so are all of its metaphysical and epistemic problems and limits. Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	IF materialism was true, THEN the veil would be a serious problem. But materialism isn't true, hence there is no problem.

<p>
	It is problematic to give students all the answers, but the reason I do it is because it is just as problematic not to. When things are left vague and ambiguous it's not like the mind will be blank. The mind will fill in the blank with wrong ideas.
</p>

<p>
	This is why I dislike the Zen style and I do not teach in that style. My mission is to create a robust catalogue of answers. If you don't like that then don't watch.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I find Zen highly misleading by trying to be mysterious. In the end I don't see any Zen students understand what I have understood.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like playing Zen games. I tell the answer exactly as I see it. It is your job to not get lost in concepts. My work is highly conceptual. I have no interest in doing teachings like Rupert Spira or Mooji.

	You can do all your astral projection and other techniques but all of them are still radically limited in consciousness.

<p>
	It is you who underestimates the vastness of consciousness.

	You can push your software and hardware to its limits, but eventually you will still hit a biological limit since you are committed to being in that human form.
</p>

<p>
	You can't do what LSD can do simply through visualiation. Visualization is nice, but it is still limited by your hardware.

<p>
	I consider psychedelics hardware because you cannot easily change your natural neurotransmitter cocktail.

<p>
	Psychedelics show you the absolute importance of hardware in consciousness.

	If you could permanently alter your natural nuerotransmitter cocktail you could acheive levels of conscious impossible otherwise.

			I find the talk about spiritual talent quite unsettling, since my emotional reaction is hearing someone telling me that I have no talent. And I'm defensive of the notion of talent as it's talked about here because I don't want to believe it and internalise it. So I won't believe it. <br />
			<br />
			This talk about talent, and a few other things like states and etc. You can call it me projecting my insecurities (which I can accept) or just not being the right thing for me to hear right now, but it doesn't foster the correct mindset in me. Hearing it talked about this way invokes in me the mindset of playing a relative game which is all about material acquisition of spiritual goodies. <br />
			Maybe what you guys is saying is 'true' , I don't know, but it doesn't help me to read it since I think it creates an incorrect mindset (Yes yes, no one is forcing me to believe it and this is just my reaction).

<p>
	It's way deeper than merely talent.
</p>

<p>
	It's more like I'm telling you that you cannot fly because you weren't born a bird. The bird isn't simply talented at flying. The bird has hardware that you don't have.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise there are many things you are not conscious of because you don't have the hardware.

<p>
	Degrees of consciousness are not an intellectualization.
</p>

<p>
	Models of consciousness are of course conceptual constructions. But that does not mean consciousness doesn't have degrees in the same way light has degrees of brightness.
</p>

<p>
	Dim light and bright light are NOT concepts. Good look at the sun.

	It happens in the sense that people hold some ideas in their minds and use these ideas to manipulate reality. Similar to religion.

<p>
	If you want to really get it, take a psychedelic.

	The situations of 2016 and 2020 are totally different and pointless to even compare. Dozens of factors were different.

Would you say that I'm just wasting my time doing that? Is it even worth it if that's all I really do? I'm asking because maybe I need to start meditating more every day, or perhaps incorporate other practices. I am in no position to take a 30 day solo retreat any time soon.

<p>
	Depends on your goals.
</p>

<p>
	It's an important habit regardless because there's no way you will be able to handle even a 10 day retreat without years of daily practice.
</p>

<p>
	1 hr per day is important but not nearly enough for serious awakening.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't do 30 days, then even 10 days is good. I had my first awakening on day 8 of a 10 day retreat. And I wasn't even meditating close to 24/7. Even 8 days of 5 hrs of strict meditation per day is enough for a breakthrough. Building up momentum is the key to breaking through. Your mind must be 100% focused on the task of awakening and not any other survival distractions.

	Something like every other day should be okay.
</p>

<p>
	Test what works for you.

<p>
	Almost certainly. Don't worry about it. Just do detox the days after.
</p>

<p>
	There is mercury in all the food and water you consume.

<p>
	Don't believe dumb articles or statistics. You are not a statistic!
</p>

<p>
	You must do deep research for solutions. Stop focusing on what isn't a solution. You must believe there is a solution.
</p>

<p>
	Don't kill yourself. Try more solutions.
</p>

	These substances are too powerful. You will not be able to hold a pencil.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe if you do microdosing.
