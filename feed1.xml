All that's required is the desire to do it.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is one unified whole, after all. The only thing fragmenting it is your mind.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to integrate every physics theory. Leave those technical details to the scientists. You want a high level big picture heart-oriented personal integration. Not a technical academic integration.

<title>A question for Leo</title>

<p>
	Most people are sheep and will remain sheep. Because to not be a sheep you must be a leader.
</p>

<p>
	Being someone's bitch just means that you are wage slave. Society is structured like a pyramid scheme, where the majority of human beings are wage slaves so that those at the top can live in luxury. This is what human society is and has always been.
</p>

<p>
	There is no complete independence, but you can be a leader and a creator and thus buy your own freedom. The only issue is that most people are content being slaves. You can rise towards the top of the pyramid. Everyone can't. But you can.
</p>

<p>
	Being a wage slave means that you do not create what you want, but what someone else wants. Fundamentally this is because you have no idea what you want to create.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why step #1 for escaping wage slavery is to become very clear about what you want to create.
</p>

<p>
	Our system is built upon human ignorance and sheepishness. It is sustainable because most people like being sheep.
</p>

<p>

This must be the case because you're creating a long term plan that's like 10 years ahead of where you are now.
</p>

<p>
	This is the burden of being a visionary. You see things 10 years before you can fully actualize them.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is to let that discourage you.
</p>

<p>
	You think I didn't feel like an imposter starting Actualized.org? You think I still don't feel like an imposter to some degree?

I never finished the Spiral series because people were getting sick of it and starting to tune out. So you haven't heard the conclusion to how Spiral Dynamics really works. There is still much to be said about it.

</p>

<p>
	To say that you are Green, for example, means that 25% of your answers are from Orange, 50% from Green, and 25% from Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	There are also different developmental lines:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Cognitive
	</li>
	<li>
		Moral/Ethical
	</li>
	<li>
		Spiritual
	</li>
	<li>
		Sexual
	</li>
	<li>
		Emotional
	</li>
	<li>
		Political
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You could be Red on the emotional line but Orange on the cognitive line. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is a nuanced and complex model requiring careful study.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a really simple rule of thumb test:
</p>

<p>
	How much do you care about ecology?
</p>

<p>
	If not, you're below Green.
</p>

<p>
	How much do you acknowledge that truth, value, and meaning is relative or a mental construction?
</p>

<p>
	If not, you're below Green.
</p>

<p>
	How much do you care about all living beings independent of their race, religion, gender, etc?
</p>

<p>
	If not, you're below Green.
</p>

<p>
	How clear are you that material success will do nothing for you?
</p>

<p>
	If so, you're Green and above.
</p>

<p>
	How much do you think your culture, nation, ethnicity is superior to others?
</p>

<p>
	If so, you're Blue.
</p>

<p>
	How much do you care about integration all the perspectives of the world, including all the sciences and all the religions?
</p>

<p>
	If so, you're at Yellow and above.
</p>

<p>
	How conscious are you that the entire world and universe is your entire body and you are identical with all sentient beings?
</p>

<p>
	If so, you're at Turquoise.
</p>

He's not an integral Tier 2 thinker. He only might appear to you that way because you yourself have too little experience with true Tier 2 integral thinking and have a soft-spot for JP's ideology.
</p>

<p>
	Only a hack would create videos for PragerU, a conservative propaganda arm equivalent to Fox News:

</p>

<p>
	JP is not reaching out a hand to anyone. He's building a personal empire off fear-mongering and culture wars. Most of his audience is not nearly sophisticated enough to see it. What JP is doing is playing identity politics, and his fanbase gobbbles it up because they have narrow, weak identities.
</p>

<p>
	JP is just an academic version of Fox News.

<p>
	He shows no awareness of any stage beyond Green. And even Green he views as a mistake.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a serious intellectual. Why waste your time on this when there are such better teachers to learn from??

<p>
	No, #2 is false even from the relative POV. Quantum mechanics has told you that matter does not exist for over 100 years. You just have a very outdated model of matter and reality.
</p>

<p>
	SCIENCE tells you that there is no such thing as physical reality! All there are, are infinite quantum fields. There are no particles!
</p>

<p>
	What's stupid are your ideas of reality. That's all.
</p>

<p>
	Surrender your ideas, and your stupidity will disappear.

	In the Absolute sense nothing exists. You gotta be careful not to conflate relative and absolute statements.
</p>

<p>
	If chakras exist, they exist relatively, in the way that your brain exists relatively.

<p>
	There is no end. I will always tell you there is more. But at some point you will hit the point of no return and you won't need me any more.

<p>
	It is worth making people generally aware that blindly following any guru is a recipe for trouble. Even if he happens to be a nice guru, the only reason you escape unscathed is because you got lucky.
</p>

<p>
	Think and contemplate for yourself and you will never get abused by a guru.
</p>

<p>
	The ones who end up abused are the ones who are sheep looking for easy answers and an idealized daddy figure to fawn over.

<p>
	The ego mind is very sneaky. It will use self-inquiry and co-opt it to build up a spiritual ego instead of actually dissolving the ego.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend supplementing self-inquiry with Kriya yoga and psychedelics.
</p>

	Reading 100 books is not mutually exclusive with sitting still.
</p>

<p>
	People who do not read end up ignorant, regardless of whatever else they do.
</p>

<p>
	You can be enlightened, but still ignorant and undeveloped.

<p>
	Meditation, yoga, and psychedelics are some of the most consistent tools for leaping up the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	Research shows that people who meditate end up jumping 2 stages higher than wherever they started in a few years.

<p>
	All such ideas and expectations will only get in the way.
</p>

<p>
	No one knows how you will react. Depends on you.
</p>

<p>
	You should not be pursuing a particular reaction, but Truth. Whatever Truth entails is whatever happens.
</p>

<p>
	That's the thing, you cannot get a preview of what you're getting into. It is unimaginable. You just have to want the Truth, whatever the cost. If you don't care about Truth you are unlikely to succeed because Truth is what we are talking about, not positive states or anything else.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is a pursuit for those you want metaphysical answers.
</p>

<p>
	So ask yourself, what do you want?
</p>

<p>
	This is like asking how long does it take to earn a million dollars?
</p>

<p>
	For most people. Never! Because it's not a function of time, it's a function of doing the right practices.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot become a millionaire by doing what you've always been doing. You must do something new. And then it can happen quickly.

<p>
	Why are you so focused on changing the community?
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you should first work on developing yourself, then maybe you can worry about uplifting others.
</p>

<p>
	Or is this part of your life purpose to help your community?
</p>

<p>
	Changing other people who do not want to change is usually a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, you could for example, run seminars or workshops that teach Spiral Dynamics or meditation as a way of raising the level of consciousness of your community. And it will work if you do it right.

<p>
	Reality is a giant Mind.
</p>

<p>
	How you think affects what you see and how you feel.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is constructing "reality". But it is in denial that it does so.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that there is a firm distinction between reality and fantasy is itself a fantasy. Which is why your fantasies are so significant. Because they become your "reality".
</p>

<p>
	LoA is about consciously creating the kind of fantasies you want, rather than letting the outside world program you with disempowering fantasies.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you tend to fantasize about tends to become real for you.
</p>

<p>
	"Objective reality" << that's a fantasy you created.

	Nice!
</p>

<p>
	Yeah... 2C-B can be real profound after 5-MeO.

<p>
	That can be tricky.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to figure that out is to contemplate honestly in your journal.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: How To Contemplate Using A Journal
</p>

<p>
	You need to really lean on radical honesty. Before you contemplate start by saying, "Okay, I'm going to be radically honest now..."
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Why are Jed McKenna fans such jerks?
</p>

<p>
	I keep seeing this over and over again.
</p>

<p>
	A Course In Miracles is actually a really advanced set of genuine nondual teachings. But you've need to have an open mind and integral approach to make sense of it. Not this black and white thinking you're doing.

</p>

<p>
	Vaporizing 5-MeO is a bit tricky. You'll probably burn it a few times before you get the technique down.
</p>

<p>
	Glass Vapor Genie is the best tool for vaporizing DMT.

<p>
	It's radical no matter what.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you watched all my videos and read all the books and you think you understand it, when it finally hits you, it will be so utterly radical, you will not believe it and your entire life will collapse and you will go, "WTF?????? NO WAY! NO WAY! NO WAY! OH MY FUCKING GOD! This cannot be true! It's too RADICAL!!! Have I gone insane??? Please, someone tell me I'm not insane. Oh, fuck, there is no one who can help me. I'm all alone..."
</p>

<p>
	It is a total mindfuck beyond anything you can imagine. And there is no way to escape the mindfuck of it. So learn to love getting skullfucked by God.

<p>
	Be careful with spreading gossip and rumors unless you have direct evidence.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, it's very possible for it to be cult. But the fact is you don't know unless you've personally experienced it.
</p>

<p>
	People call Actualized.org a cult all the time. When you're dealing with large groups of people, there will also be some disgruntled and crazy ones who just make shit up and try to demonize because they get triggered by spiritual teachings. I'm sure many people out there misunderstand Mooji. Then again, I would not be surprised if it turned out to be a cult. Both are possible.
</p>

<p>
	I will shoot a video about cult psychology coming soon.
</p>

<p>
	And, BTW, enlightenment and cults are not mutually exclusive. You can have two in one! It's a very popular formula.

</p>

<p>
	I would also rigorously document the clinical and therapeutic benefits, so the government would have zero basis to claim that 5-MeO has no legit medical properties. It needs to be made clear that anyone who denies the effectiveness of 5-MeO is being unscientific.

<p>
	No. Just no. That is not what reality is.

You cannot consume it any other way as the smoking burns off the other stuff in venom, which is what you want. Who knows what kind of nasty toxins are in that venom.
</p>

<p>
	From what I understand the Bufotinine will mostly burn off or get overshadowed by the 5-MeO so the % does not really matter. You'd just want to start with a really small dose and work your way up inch by inch. Smoked 5-MeO is extremely fast and hard-hitting.

<p>
	If only you would stop being lazy.

<p>
	I read a news article yesterday about how a woman used Google to search for "how to kill a person without getting caught"
</p>

<p>
	She found her answer and killed her two babies through suffocation.
</p>

<p>
	That's how powerful Google is.
</p>

<p>
	Of course she got caught cause she should have used DuckDuckGo and Tor instead.

<p>
	The fact is, you don't want to be enlightened.

<p>
	All you're doing here is just wasting time playing ego games and fantasizing about enlightenment.

<p>

<title>The &quot;OTHER&quot;ing Problem and Being Unwise with Paradigm Choice</title>

<p>
	Yes, the problem is that many people who say "all is one" have not ACTUALIZED that statement in their own life. They've taken it on as a talking point. It is not true in their direct experience of life. So actually they are lying to themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Doing spiritual work requires us to be honest about where we currently are. We have to stop and ask ourselves, "Is 'all is one' true for me?", and the answer will often be No.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not enlightened, it is a bad idea to go around talking and acting as if you were.
</p>

<p>
	If you have not directly experienced God, it is a bad idea to go around talking and thinking God exists. The truth is, for you, God does not exist.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	All of that is ego.
</p>

<p>
	That whole post is ego playing drama queen.
</p>

<p>
	You have not reached meaninglessness, because clearly you are creating a lot of negative meaning here.
</p>

<p>
	What is required is more consciousness. It's sort of like you've wounded the ego, not anywhere close to killing it, and now it's pissed off like an angry hornets nest.
</p>

<p>
	A little bit of consciousness is a dangerous thing, as they say.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is go back to the basic practices and ground yourself in high quality nondual theory and mindfulness work.
</p>

<p>
	You are trying to do this too fast. It does not work that way. There are many facets to consciousness work. When you try to jump ahead to the end before you are truly developed enough to handle it, you just create a massive ego backlash and nothing sticks.
</p>

<p>
	Ground yourself in core daily practices like meditation. Train yourself to do it consistently and with joy.
</p>

<p>
	Do not take Iboga by yourself, and unless you're a veteran of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	You could seriously harm yourself otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're asking to play with a live hand grenade.

<p>
	No, that is not what I mean when I say that brain does not exist. I mean something far more radical. I also mean your body does not really exist.
</p>

<p>
	Nor does "the brain" serve the metaphysical role you believe it serves (the ground and source of existence).
</p>

<p>
	The brain is a part of the mind. There really isn't a brain because all there is, is mind.

<p>
	A) That's a really old video, prior to my various deep nondual insights like brains do not exist.
</p>

<p>
	B) "The brain" is a relative construct, a symbol within a network of symbols we use to make sense of the world. It has a certain relative meaning, in the same way that the word "country" has a certain relative meaning even though there is no such thing as "a country" in the world.

<p>
	This issue keeps coming up again and again and I keep telling you guys the same simple solution:
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics!
</p>

<p>
	Stop all the mental masturbating and go experience an altered state of consciousness. Then you will understand what this work is about. It's NOT what you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	It is like you're a child asking, "But what are the benefits of an orgasm? Logically explain to me why I should stick my penis inside a vagina."
</p>

<p>
	Do it and see what happens.

<p>
	125ug of LSD takes me into full God-mode. But this is not going to be the case for the average tripper. They would probably need to triple that dose to get a similar effect.
</p>

<p>
	Tolerance to psychedelics can vary quite significantly from person to person.
</p>

<p>
	And one's level of cognitive/metaphysical development plays an important role in how deeply you trip, from what I can tell.
</p>

<p>
	My trips are always extremely profound, beyond most trip reports. I'm not sure why this is. It feels like psychedelics were designed specifically for my brain/mind type.

<p>
	Meditation is about stilling the mind to an extreme degree.

<p>
	Contemplation involves using the mind.

"The process" is DIRECT!
</p>

<p>
	The content IS the process! There is zero distance between rendering and the thing displayed.
</p>

<p>
	Because reality has infinite power, it does not require a computational process. There is no process. There is only the end result.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of reality as a computer simulation. It is NOT that. It is direct, instantaneous, magic.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing behind the scenes. What you see is all there is, so to speak. The problem is, your mind does not know how to make sense of reality this way. You are used to analyzing it conceptually into a linear chain of cause and effect. This is fantasy, not reality.

<p>
	Everything you see IS the experience of consciousness creating the dream.

<p>
	The mechanism of creation is not hidden behind the scenes somewhere. It is TOTALLY, RADICALLY direct! You are seeing God's creation process every second. You're just overlooking it because you're expecting something elsewhere. Your fantasy of God's creation process is obscuring awareness of God's actual creation process.

At least for now, until you find something better.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get too cute with stuff like: I'm going to master myself. Yes, of course you will. But you also want some tangible marketable skills which you can use to build a career around.
</p>

<p>
	When you commit to something like "I will master teaching" or "I will master writing" or "I will master speaking", that is a very powerful and actionable intention. It sets you on a solid and clear career path.
</p>

<p>
	When you say something like "I will master myself" I picture you 10 years from now living in your mom's basement sniffing your own farts. Because it's such a vague and abstract intention.
</p>

<p>
	What tangible things are you gonna offer the world once you've mastered you?
</p>

<p>
	The world is not gonna pay you to sit there basking in your own self-mastery.

</p>

<p>
	Which should be enough to get you seriously interested in reading books about LP and doing research.
</p>

<p>
	Do you want to live a passionate life?
</p>

<p>
	Yes?
</p>

<p>
	Then how can you not be passionate about reading a few books about how to create a passionate life???
</p>

<p>
	That's like wanting to be a millionaire but then saying, "Oh man... I don't want to read these books about becoming a millionaire."
</p>

<p>
	Think it through. Connect the dots.
</p>

<p>
	As I said in the Life Is A Maze video, you're in a maze whether you like it or not. So you might as well get curious and passionate about doing research to figure this maze out. You got something more important to do?
</p>

<p>
	To be successful at life you gotta love learning about how life works. Why don't you love learning about life?
</p>

<p>
	Living up to your highest ideals is very challenging. Only very serious students of consciousness work can do it.
</p>

<p>
	And even then, it is also very important to learn to drop your ideals, as they are ultimately imaginary and stand in the way of full acceptance of reality.
</p>

<p>
	I will talk more about the downsides of having high ideals in the future.

</p>

<p>
	You are a like an arrogant freshman who thinks he knows more than the professor teaching the class, trying to school the professor. It's just naive arrogance.
</p>

<p>
	I am pointing you to things you have clearly not become conscious of yet. I'm not here trying to brainwash you into my dogma. You just haven't done enough inner work or research to understand the complexity of these issues yet.
</p>

<p>
	This is not personal, or a debate. You just need to be willing to learn and explore new perspectives. That is all. There is no need to get defensive. I am here to help you. You are not being asked to believe anything here on blind faith. You are being invited to inquire deeply and openmindedly into the true nature of what meaning, value, and morality are. Not what you think they are. Not what you want them to be. But what they ACTUALLY are: constructions of your mind.

</p>

<p>
	Which is what I was pointing out to you.
</p>

<p>
	But you keep clinging to morality as truth without being open to other possibilities. So they conversation is useless. You hold morality as an unquestionable dogma. That is the issue here.
</p>

<p>
	Love is a facet of Absolute Being. It's not a moral issue but an existential one. You're conflating love and morality.

<p>
	Hallucination is a very specific word which has a precise definition: "An appearance without substance. A purely mental phenomena which does not correspond with any external objective thing." That's reality.

What you are intuiting the is infinity nature of reality. That's because it really is infinite. Which means that you will never pin down the Truth with finite symbols or thoughts. Cause/effect is a linear, dualistic, finite scheme which cannot get at the whole of reality. It can only get at finite, limited pieces of reality. It will always be just a partial map, never the whole territory.
</p>

<p>
	The territory is truly infinite, nonlinear, and non-causal.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you can have a direct insight that every object in your room has an infinite chain of causes leading to its creation. I once become conscious that my Apple laptop power cord was created by an infinite chain of causes. What a mindfuck that was. To this day I cannot look at my power cord the same way again.
</p>

<p>
	Every object in your room has actually existed for eternity.

<title>Problems Only Being Within The Mind</title>

How you feel about a situation is definitely created by the way your mind evaluates or interprets it. And this you can definitely change with lots of consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	You may not be able to change how your son behaves. But that does not matter because the key is to change how you feel about how he behaves.
</p>

<p>
	If you were more grounded in yourself your sons action's -- as bad as they might be -- would not bother you nearly as much, and you would also be more resourceful at finding an external solution, like for example, helping him to pinpoint the root cause of his problems.
</p>

<p>
	What consciousness will teach you is to let go of control and to surrender and accept terrible things gracefully.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that you can always control every bad thing in life is foolish. It just cannot happen because fundamentally the ego is not in control of anything. Control is one of the chief illusions which consciousness work tackles. You have to learn to accept things more. Counter-intuitively, this will make you more powerful, not less.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	One = Many
</p>

<p>
	Many = One
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute reincarnates infinitely as EVERYTHING. That's nonduality. Not only that, you are ALL beings at all times right now! You just aren't conscious of it. There is no need to wait for an afterlife as you are ALL beings already right now.
</p>

<p>
	There is nowhere in the universe you can go where you are already not. You are the whole shebang!

<p>
	The purpose of most businesses is never about helping people, it is about maximizing profit.
</p>

<p>
	So of course! Maximizing profit at the expense of others is the go-to strategy for becoming wealthy.
</p>

<p>
	This is the very definition of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	But it doesn't have to be that way. It's possible to run a conscious business that doesn't prioritize profit. Of course this means less profit. Which is why so few people choose this path.

</p>

<p>
	That is what most people do.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem with it is, it's fundamentally based on falsehood, which requires that you enter a cycle of self-denial which then creates lots of suffering and stifles your ability to be a conscious and loving human being.
</p>

<p>
	To be truly moral, you must surrender morality.
</p>

<p>
	Is it threatening to your way of life? Of course, which is why almost nobody does it. Takes massive courage and lots of inner work. But it is worth it.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive solution is to surrender your way of life.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12390-sagemodeaustin/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="12390" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12390-sagemodeaustin/" rel="">@SageModeAustin</a> You should draw a distinction between inherent objective value vs having personal preferences.
</p>

<p>
	Absolutely-speaking, everything has equal value.
</p>

<p>
	Relatively-speaking, some things have more survival value to you than other things. Value is a relative notion. A thing has instrumental value to you precisely because it helps the ego survive.
</p>

<p>
	You can be conscious that all human beings have equal Absolute value, but you can still be selective about who you hang out with. For example, even though a murder has the same Absolute value as a non-murder, it would be foolish and even dangerous to make friends with a bunch of murders.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make is that they then take the extra step of demonizing murders and denying that they have equal Absolute value.
</p>

<p>
	So, you can be very selective about who you choose to sleep with, but it would be a mistake to demonize and judge those women who you don't want to sleep with. Just be honest and admit to yourself, "I don't want to sleep with that person. But this does not diminish that person in any way. They can still be a good person even though I don't find them sexually attractive."
</p>

<p>
	The mistake that guys like you make is that they think like this: "That women is ugly to me, therefore she is a low, worthless human being." This is a narcissistic evaluation. You are saying that just because a person doesn't fit your survival agenda that they are somehow inherently flawed or lower. When the truth is, she just doesn't fit your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Also realize that when you call anything in reality "ugly" you are actually disowning that aspect of reality, of yourself. Because the truth is, that ugly thing you hate is actually, literally, metaphysically, your very self. So you are placing yourself in an adversarial relationship with reality, with yourself! Which is the very definition of neurosis.
</p>

<p>
	When you call a thing "ugly" you are failing to become conscious of its inherent beauty. The beauty is there no matter what. But you are failing to see it because you are being too self-centered.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to live in a non-judgmental way.
</p>

<p>
	The irony of chasing hot girls is that the karma of it always comes back to bite you in the ass and make you suffer. Just by thinking, "Oooooo... look at this hot girl, so much better than that ugly fat girl" you are causing your own misery without realizing it. When you lose that hot girl, it will hurt all the more.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying you should sleep with girls you aren't attracted to. But you might want to reconsider the way you objectify women and use them to gratify your most base, most low consciousness desires in a purely materialistic fashion. Maybe rather than basing your attraction purely on looks, you give more weight to her personality and her level of consciousness, and you focus more on how you can give her love rather than how she can please you.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason a hot girl has value to you is because you crave her. And yes, it is possible to let go of craving. The trick is convincing your ego to do it.
</p>

<title>Transcendental Meditation Effective?</title>

<p>
	Careful, it is a cult-like organization.
</p>

<p>
	You can find non-cult-like forms of meditation or yoga which are just as effective if not more effective, and without the cult ideology.
</p>

<p>
	Many cults have legit spiritual techniques that they offer to newbies, but they are still manipulative cults.

<p>
	The downside of hardwiring anything is that you then become inflexible in a rapidly changing environment.
</p>

<p>
	The most effective survival strategy is not mechanical, but highly intelligent, fluid, and conscious.
