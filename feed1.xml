And whether something is decontructive depends on your self-agenda. Hitler's Holocaust was constructive from his POV. And the meteor wiping out the dinosaurs was constructive for many species, but destructive to the dinosaurs.
</p>

<p>
	When you judge whether something is destructive, you are effectively saying, "That is destructive TO ME and the status quo that helps my survival."
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as Absolute construction or destruction. The death of one universe gives rise to another.

<p>
	You are overlooking a very important point: that "you" is an illusion. After enlightenment, you're not identified with being human any more. Your identification shifted to Nothingness and therefore Everything. So there is nothing to improve because you are the whole universe in all its possible forms.
</p>

<p>
	How can you improve infinity? Infinity includes every possible state. So there's nowhere to run.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, the concept of "improvement" only makes sense if you assume time exists. And at higher levels of consciousness, it doesn't. You become so present to the NOW that you cannot even conceptualize a future in which something could be better or worse. And of course the concepts "better" and "worse" are just judgments of the ego-mind to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	I think they stole most of the idea from the novel, Neuromancer.
</p>

<p>
	Neuromancer explicitly has a "the Matrix" in it.
</p>

<p>
	From Wikipedia:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			The novel has had significant linguistic influence, popularizing such terms asÂ cyberspaceÂ and ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics). Gibson himself coined the term "cyberspace" in his novelette "Burning Chrome", published in 1982 byÂ OmniÂ magazine.[18]Â It was only through its use inÂ NeuromancerÂ that the termÂ CyberspaceÂ gained enough recognition to become theÂ de factoÂ term for theÂ World Wide WebÂ during the 1990s.[19][20]Â The portion ofÂ NeuromancerÂ usually cited in this respect is:
		</p>

		<p>
			The matrix has its roots in primitive arcade games. â¦ Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts. â¦ A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.[21]
		</p>

		<p>
			The 1999 cyberpunk science fiction filmÂ The MatrixÂ particularly draws fromÂ NeuromancerÂ both eponym and usage of the term "matrix".[22]Â "After watching The Matrix, Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was 'exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis" he had relied upon in his own writing.'"[23]
		</p>

		<p>
			In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue ofÂ Neuromancer, fellow authorÂ Jack WomackÂ goes as far as to suggest that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet developed (particularly theÂ World Wide Web), after the publication ofÂ NeuromancerÂ in 1984. He asks "[w]hat if the act of writing it down, in fact,Â brought it about?" (269).

<p>
	The following analogy might help you guys.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is like living life inside The Matrix.
</p>

<p>
	Truth/Enlightenment is like escaping The Matrix and realizing it's all a virtual simulation.
</p>

<p>
	Then, once you've exited The Matrix, you can re-enter it, but this time you're aware that you're inside a virtual simulation. You still have to survive if you want to stay in The Matrix, but your survival is different than ordinary survival. Ordinary survival isn't self-aware, whereas now you are surviving in a self-aware manner, and you can even bend some of the rules of The Matrix, stopping time, dodging bullets, etc. But if one of those bullets hits you in the head, you're still gonna die. At least your avatar will.
</p>

<p>
	Can you see how a question like, "How do we fight terrorism?" is a distraction from breaking free of The Matrix? Terrorism is part of the virtual simulation. If you get too wrapped up and angry about terrorism, you're losing sight of the bigger picture, which is that EVERYTHING you see is just a video game. You're getting lost in the video game world. You're confusing the video game world for Truth. Nothing is good or bad, because it's all just a video game.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if Mario, from Super Mario World, started to take his life seriously. That would be a problem. He would be too afraid of jumping on a platform, cause for him it would be life and death. He would think he only has 1 life. He would become angry and bitter at all these evil spikey dangerous turtles walking around. He would become blind to the fact that he and the turtles are actually all part of one unified simulation. And so the whole game would turn into a nightmare. All just because he takes himself too seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Mario would start a political talk radio show where he rants against spikey turtles for corrupting the fabric of Mario World. He would call for a border wall to block the spikey turtles from entering Mario World. He would recruit other inhabitants of Mario World which align with his self-agenda to bolster his cause. The turtles would do the same. The two sides would demonize each other. And then you'd have an all-out battle between the two. Neither side realizing that it's all just a virtual simulation.
</p>

<p>
	You can know suffering without holding it as "evil" or "bad" or "wrong", or judging it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there is a lot of suffering in the world. But it is not evil. And it necessary. And it is largely self-inflicted due to lack of consciousness. So if you really want to reduce suffering, it would be wise to stop judging it.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Â You are very much affected by others. "Survival" here means a lot more than just foraging for food and building shelter. You are a deeply social creature. You could not survive without other human beings. You are almost totally dependant on other human beings to keep you alive. Human survival is largely social. Which is why you care about your self-image so much. Which is why you'd be embarrassed to walk outside naked in the middle of New York City. It very much affects your survival. And which is why you might be scared to approach a girl and ask her on a date. Your survival is on the line all the time. Every action you take all day long is basically you grappling with survival. Every thought you have is you manipulating yourself to increase your survive.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the truth of this.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">

			What about that guy who shot up the concert in Las Vegas? Would such people be put in jail in your enlightened society? Shall everyone just allow themselves to be mowed down, should all the cops not react to the shooting?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a survival question, which has nothing to do with Truth or enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	The question of "How do we build a good society?" is really the question of "How do I increase my odds at survival?"
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with building a better society, but it is irrelevant to Truth. In fact, it's a big distraction from pursuing Truth. And if you try to build a better society from a position of survival, you will inadvertently cause a lot of suffering to people, because you're acting out of self-preservation, not genuine greater good.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, that it is also possible to jail a person without calling him bad or evil. You could jail him with compassion and genuinely help him to heal. I am not saying we shouldn't have laws and jails. Laws and jails are necessary in a large, complex society. But what isn't necessary is the judgment, demonization, and self-righteousness that goes along with it.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's fine. But that's an issue of survival. You can be enlightened and also be engaged in survival. But you're not likely to get enlightened so long as you're preoccupied with survival.

<p>
	That's because he hasn't actually become conscious of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever awakening he has had, it wasn't deep enough.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of realization. And he still has a long way to go.
</p>

<p>
	His rationalist paradigm is keeping him from full surrendering to God.
</p>

<p>
	Realizing no-self is not the same thing as realizing God. God sits deeper.

There's not much choice. Either you choose to kill yourself or you choose to keep living. If you choose to keep living, then you might as well enjoy living. In which case, you might as well set some goals for yourself that you feel will please you and help the world. And then you discipline yourself to work on those goals and enjoy the process.
</p>

<p>
	That's life in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
	Even though I know it's meaningless, I still have certain things I want to get out of life, and certain things I want to create. The creativity is for its own sake. Start doing the things you find most fascinating/beautiful. Or, if you can't do that immediately due to financial limitations, then make a strategic plan to work towards that goal. Ideally, every day should be you doing your art and enjoying the process and enjoying life. You'll need a strategic plan to actualize that. But first you need to find your life purpose (the thing you find most fascinating/beautiful).
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's challenging. Some days are difficult.
</p>

<p>
	You should study enlightened masters more. The really enlightened ones say exactly that. This is actually one of the most essential features of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	You are not deeply enlightened unless you realize that all meaning and value is a construct of the mind. "Evil" is an evaluation, and it is always a fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	There can be no peace in you unless you realize that meaning and value are things your mind creates.
</p>

<p>
	There can be no true love unless you are able to love the selfishness of others. What do you think Jesus taught you? Unconditional love. Which means, you cannot see evil any more.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that as soon as you make a judgment or evaluation of any kind, you are automatically disconnected from Truth.

	Notice, that this just your self-survival talking. "Immoral" is a judgment your ego-mind makes because these people threat your ability to survive.
</p>

<p>
	"Immoral" and "evil" and "bad" are all the same basic judgment. Doesn't matter what label you use.

<p>
	Yes, low consciousness people -- especially people who have been through a lot of personal suffering -- are reacting against that suffering by inflicting it on others. But what Peterson is not telling you is that suffering is not bad or evil. And these people are not bad or evil. That irony is that there is nothing evil about ego or selfishness. It requires ego to judge that selfishness is wrong.

<p>
	Have you seen my video: What Is The Devil?
</p>

<p>
	If not, you should really watch it. It's one of my best.
</p>

<p>
	Evil is simply a judgment the ego-mind makes because it wants to survive. See? Anything that threatens your survival you will call "evil". It's as simple as that.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the reason terrorists are thought of as evil by much of Western civilization is only because they threaten the survival of Western civilization.
</p>

<p>
	If you didn't care about survival, nothing would be evil to you.
</p>

<p>
	From God's perspective nothing is evil because God is infinite and cannot die. So it would be nice if you were able to switch your identification from being a human ego to being God. Then you'd stop seeing evil in the world. You'd see the world through God's eyes, which is ego-less.
</p>

<p>
	Since low consciousness correlates to denser ego, it also correlates to greater selfishness and greater potential for "evil" -- that is, doing selfish acts. As consciousness increases, the ego thins out, and this correlates with selflessness. Selfless people have much less need to do selfish acts. They are more loving and caring and gentle because they are not preoccupied with their own survival.
</p>

<p>
	An egoless person can sacrifice his life without much problem. Not because he is brave, but because he knows he's infinite and cannot really die.
</p>

This is not a problem per se. Sadhguru, for example, teaches you to focus your eyes upwards about 6 inches in front of your 3rd eye. The strain goes away with practice. It's not painful, it's just some mild tension. Do it gently.
</p>

<p>
	Or you can focus on other spots in the head, like the crown, which is what I do these days. I like the crown cause that's the most important chakra we want to open.

<p>
	Sit in a yoga pose and visualize loving energy flowing up your spine into your heart, then visualize your heart radiating love. Really feel it. This activates your heart chakra and helps open it up. Keep doing that and you will become more loving.
</p>

<p>
	It also helps to bring up memories of intense beauty or love that you've experienced in the past.
</p>

<p>
	You are sort of shifting your state with this technique.

<p>
	The infinity part sounds familiar. There's no mistaking infinity when it hits you.

Pranayama is really the heart of the practice. Everything else is secondary.
</p>

<p>
	Focus on learning the spinal breathing. Really master it. That is the key to it all.

<p>
	True, but think of the image from a PR perspective:
</p>

<p>
	CNN Breaking News: "Enlightened master beats follower with sharp stick and enjoys it. What a monster!" <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is, the enlightened master doesn't have a problem with his anger. It's the outside world that judges him. And unfortunately for him, the outside world ain't as enlightened as he is.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru has been accused of murder and holding followers hostage in his cult. I've been accused of being a pedophile. So yeah... if you're gonna be enlightened, you need to develop a stomach for being misunderstood.
</p>

It basically lets them use human beings as guinea pigs without repercussions. That bill prohibits the FDA from collecting any statistics on people who die from those trial treatments. So drug companies can feed sick patients experimental new drugs, and if those patients die or become even more sick, the government is legally prohibited from collecting and using that data against the drug companies. It's a very clever bit of law.

<p>
	That's generally correct. Except, enlightened masters are also humans, and can also get triggered and get angered in an unconscious way. Just because you're enlightened does not mean you're in control of your emotions 24/7. Enlightened masters also get horny. So watch out <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	If you poke someone with a sharp stick long enough -- even Sadhguru -- he will probably get angry and beat you with it.

<p>
	In personal correspondences with Martin I have asked him about whether he thinks smoking 5-MeO can cause any kind of energetic or psychological damage. And he just flatly says No.
</p>

<p>
	I disagree about that. I think 5-MeO, especially smoked in large doses, if one is unprepared, can cause energetic and psychological damage. So I would be very cautious. Rectal administration is much safer, especially for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	You also need to take into account that Octavio has done like 10,000 of these psychedelic ceremonies. So you have to reasonably ask yourself, if 1 out of 5,000 sessions going bad is really that bad of a ratio. With psychedelics as powerful as 5-MeO, I would expect 1 out of 1,000 people to have serious negative side effects. So it's complicated.
</p>

<p>
	1/1,000 surgeries certainly goes really bad.
</p>

<p>
	Smoking 5-MeO for someone who isn't ready for it, is gonna be in for a wild ride. Hell, I don't even dare to smoke it.
</p>

<p>
	Well... about that Martin clip... you see... no matter how enlightened you are, you can still get angry. In fact, Zen masters are famous for their fits of anger.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightened rage, they call it <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Newbies often confuse enlightenment for saintliness, and that just isn't the case. It is possible to be an enlightened prick. Of course, it's also possible to be an unenlightened prick. So how do you tell the difference?
</p>

<p>
	Corruption is common among even highly enlightened yogis and masters in all traditions.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if 5-MeO is being administered by these people in a forced or dangerous way, that is not good. They could be doing that whether they are enlightened or not. Of course I have no idea if any of these rumors are true. From my limited interactions with Martin, he seems legit and he has a good heart. Of course I have no idea how he behaves behind closed doors.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Being is prior to doubt. Doubt is constructed out of being.
</p>

<p>
	Also, if you become conscious of Infinity, you simultaeously become everything that has ever existed, past, present, and future. Your being is so total that you realize you are every possible thing that could ever be. It is beyond all possible doubt. You realize that you exist as every doubt that every living creature in the entire universe has ever had, and infinitely more.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are God, this is no doubt you are God. Hence it's called awakening. You are 100% awake to the entire functioning of the universe. Nothing is hiddenÂ from your awareness. You realize there is no place for anything to hide. There is nothing behind the scenes. Everything is seen to be precisely what it is, without reliance onÂ experience or knowledge. It is omniscience. But it is nonverbal, so you cannot speak it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Then I replaced most of his techniques with Pranayama.
</p>

<p>
	Different strokes for different folks I guess.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the question is not whether his yoga is good, but whether Kriya is better. I cannot say definitively, but I had to make a choice. I like Kriya more. But I have not done Sadhguru's advanced trainings, so I cannot speak to that. Maybe he has some killer advanced techniques?Â I dunno.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I interviewed one of his advanced students and when I asked him about enlightenment, he said, "I don't know what enlightenment is", which was a big red flag for me. I highly doubt most of his advancedÂ students are enlightened. But I could be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between doing yoga and being enlightened.

<p>
	No, what I am trying to communicate to you is that Nothingness is existence.
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness is NOT non-existence. This is a very important point:
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness exists!
</p>

<p>
	You're still not realizing that non-existence is a concept, which is occurs within existence.

Which is why so few folks are enlightened. You should figure, if something is so rare that 1 in a million people have it, there must be a catch. And that's the catch.
</p>

<p>
	The good news is, there's nothing to fear about death. It's a marvelous thing. Your experiences of suffering were not death, they were life! Be careful not to project that onto enlightenment. Whatever suffering or fear you experienced, that was not enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire post is an expression of fear. That is perfectly normal, but start to notice that it's just fear. You fear pursuing enlightenment, and you fear not pursuing enlightenment. Yes, that's normal. That will need to be resolved with time. Be patient. Allow yourself time.
</p>

<p>
	You are more powerful than you give yourself credit. The way out of your dilemma is to keep doing the practices and growing. As you grow, your fears will dissolve more and more, gradually. Do more trips and see that death is nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>
	Just because right now you feel that you are not strong enough to surrender, doesn't mean it will always be that way. Right now you are weak, but a month from today you might become strong. You don't know how strong you are yet. So don't worry about it too much.
</p>

<p>
	For now, just very practically, I would say: focus on your daily practices: yoga, meditation, self-inquiry. The beauty of yoga is that it will build up your strength and gradually dissolve your fears, so that surrender becomes easy.
</p>

It's actually beyond knowledge or experience, you are it. You are the Absolute. You can't get any more direct than that. When you're at infinite consciousness, there is no doubt. Doubt is an activity of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can go to the Absolute and then fall back down into the relative. That's mostly what happens after a trip. But the Absolute was nevertheless the Absolute while you were in it. And really, it's still here. It hasn't gone anywhere. You're just disconnected from it. Like clouds temporary blotting out the sun. The sun is always there shining. Even on a cloudy day.

	Even if I achieved full Buddhahood, nothing for you would change. You would still not know if I was deluded or wrong. There is only one way for you to know the Truth, and that is to awaken for yourself. That is the only way. Yes, from your POV I could be wrong, mistaken, deluded. Then again, maybe it's you who are wrong, mistaken, deluded?
</p>

<p>
	I'll tell you what the rest of life is like after I live it. I am a work in progress and there is still much I have to discover about this whole process of awakening. But I can tell you for sure that the Absolute exists, and you can discover it for yourself, and it's more amazing than anything you could imagine.

<p>
	Full lotus requires lots of stretching. Many probably not everyone can do it.

<p>
	I think they can be life-changing, although personally, to me, I found his yoga not as potent as the Kriya we're discussing here. It probably gets more potent as you go to his advanced programs, but his introductory program didn't seem potent enough for my liking. It would make sense to me that he, being very responsible, would save the most potent techniques only for his most advanced students. And I don't like jumping through all those hoops to get the most potent techniques. I want something I can learn at home on my own. Hence I prefer Kriya. But this not to say you shouldn't do his programs or that his teachings are bad. He's knows what he's doing. He has to be very careful about taking his yoga to millions of people. At those scales, a lot of things can go wrong, so you have to teach very responsibly and focus on safety.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking, the more mainstream a teaching gets, the more watered down it gets.

<p>
	There is no such thing as non-existence, only existence. Non-existence is a concept existing in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness, existence, and Nothingness are all the same thing, but this "Nothingness" is not non-existence, it is existence. Existence is, and it is empty. Then it can get filled with all kinds ofÂ forms, one of which is the concept of non-existence.
</p>

<p>
	Existence has no opposite. It only feels like it does because the ego-mind creates a conceptual "should", telling itself, "But why doesn't X exist?" But thatÂ is existence!
</p>

<p>
	"Non-existence" exists within existence.

<p>
	There is no such thing as non-being. Even after the body dies, you will still not escape being. Being is infinite and eternal. So you're stuck being whether you like it or not. So might as well surrender to it.

<p>
	By "Being" I don't mean "your life", or some way that you are, I mean the substance of reality.

			Being does not have an absolute point, value or meaning. But there is definitely a relative point, value, and meaning that might or might not be created by ego-minds. To boil all points, value and meanings as simply ego-mind self-preservation is kind of dumb unless you mean it in an absolute sense. You know you're beyond of knowing that for sure, that's why you're so uncertain of your writing.
		</p>

		<p>
			Play some music. Lying about your experience is ego-mind trying to fulfill a specific story and not tell what the experience is.
		</p>

		<p>
			You're really telling an ego to look around the room and notice every object has no value or meaning. The fact that I have a chair in my room is due to an attribute of its meaning beyond the ego-mind. You don't understand why you're typing here or writing to each other. Is your pursuit of enlightenment, being a sage, and teaching, meaningless? You don't know. Does a hunter 300,000 years ago think about what the point of the spear does, or why he aims it? He doesn't know. That's what Thinker ego-mind does. Do you think about the computer or the chair? Or science?

<p>
	It's not dumb. It's what is. Meaning and value are inventions -- and you are still obviously resisting this by playing these clever mind-games.
</p>

<p>
	You haven't yet become conscious of what Being or meaning are. Careful with that arrogance. It's keeping you from growing.
</p>

<p>
	You would greatly benefit from doing that exercise for a month or two.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, what we are talking about is switching orientation from living from the relative to the Absolute. Which requires becoming conscious that meaning is an invention of your mind.

</p>

<p>
	It's hard to solve this problem by sitting at home on your couch.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can also be helpful. They will reveal to you how to be authentic. Then you can carry those lessons over into social life. I found mushrooms to be good for this issue. They make you more playful, uninhibited, and goofy.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, it's a bit paradoxical.
</p>

<p>
	I like to experiment and tinker with stuff and do things my way. I accept the risks.
</p>

<p>
	For newbies I suggest you pick a book/school and stick with it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't think the differences between the two books is as great as it might seem. It's variations on the same basic thing. There are dozens of schools of yoga because in practice, people end up making tweaks and variations to suit themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Because most yoga is taught dogmatically, many schools sorta lie to their students that "You must do it perfectly the way I teach it, or it will not work". But this seems obviously false since there are many different masters from many different schools. So there's clearly some degree of leeway. The question is, when have you taken it too far? And that cannot be easily answered. You will only know by trail and error.

			What about the sentence "Life is suffering" that all the religious people have always talked about? Isn't that more accurate than pointless, valueless, and meaningless? The latter three seem like emotions to me, for example, the experience of meaning can be quietness of self-referential thoughts or a piece of Music.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Life is suffering from the ego-mind's POV.
</p>

<p>
	What the religious people meant when they said "Life is suffering" is "Ordinary materialistic life is suffering" and that this can be transcended with deep enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	BEING is pointless, valueless, and meaningless. This is not an emotional statement. This is as factual as it gets. This is really not different from what physics would tell you: atoms do not have value or meaning.
</p>

<p>
	It's actually a very important milestone in the spiritual journey for you to realize that BEING is meaningless. The ego-mind creates meaning to enable self-preservation to happen. Suffering cannot end unless meaning is realized to be an illusion. Suffering comes from the mind's pursuit of meaning and value.
</p>

<p>
	Here's the 1st exercise from A Course In Miracles Workbook: Look around the room and notice that every object has no value or meaning. Like, you see a chair. What does a chair mean? Nothing.
</p>

<p>
	It's a very simple but powerful exercise. Keep doing it.

<p>
	Yes, it's challenging to rewire your motivations. At deep levels of consciousness you realize that everything is pointless, valueless, and meaningless. So there's really no reason to do anything. And this can feel depressing and demotivating for a while. But that's true detachment. You just have to give yourself time and find ways to ground yourself. You can build up some healthy ambitions over time which are based on a higher purpose, even though you know purpose is an invention.
</p>

<p>
	It can be tricky. Make sure you give yourself time. Don't make any rash decisions or actions. And trust that if you're in a depressive funk, that will not last forever. You will pull out of it with time.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest mistake people make when they are depressed is that they assume this depression will last forever. It will not.
</p>

<p>
	I think the way this problem is overcome in a tradition such as Zen is through rigorous habits and discipline. After enlightenment, the laundry. It's a grounding exercise.
</p>

<p>
	I do a mix of Pranayama 2 + the Pranayama described in Gamana's book.
</p>

<p>
	You can play around with different versions, the essence is the same. I like to visualize energy flowing up the spine to the very top of the head through all the charkas. I think the more precise your visualization gets, the better.
</p>

<p>
	Gamana says not to visualize the energy flowing up each chakra, but I feel it's more powerful to visualize it. I find that doing a detailed visualization also helps stabilize and focus the monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	Experiment around and see what works best for you.

You're still trying to reason this out intellectually, and that will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Stop theorizing and do the practices with an open mind. (Right now, your mind is not open.)
</p>

<p>
	The situation is the exact opposite what you think: Truth is all there is. There is no such thing as non-Truth. Non-Truth does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of spiritual practice is that it IS possible to transcend experience. Experience is not all there is. Experience is a 2nd order phenomena. 1st order is BEING, which requires no experiencer. Experience is a dualistic notion, which is why it must be transcended.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness, experience will become recontextualized into Absolute Being. Nothing visual will change. But a radical recontextualization will happen once the ego is seen to be non-existent. You will realize that what you used to call "experience" was really Absolute Being the whole time, you just weren't conscious of it because the ego was in the way.

</p>

<p>
	For example, when was the last time you did a 10 day retreat?
</p>

<p>
	Do you do yoga every day?
</p>

<p>
	Do you do psychedelics?
</p>

<p>
	That's where the results are. Simple but tangible stuff like that.
</p>

<p>
	Theory -- while important and necessary -- produces very little results.
</p>

<p>
	I would tweak that to say: the goal is to be joyful with whatever is.
</p>

<p>
	So if you're feeling crummy, be joyful about it. It sounds paradoxical, and it is, but it's not.

<p>
	The why is, you want to feel good, feel complete.
</p>

<p>
	If you felt complete right now, you would not want anything.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that every day, you feel incomplete. Your entire life, you've felt incomplete. So you chase things which you think will make you feel complete.
</p>

<p>
	But it never works, because completeness is an existential insight, not a material object.
</p>

<p>
	This is because, you are disconnected from who/what you are existentially. Completeness can only come with existential understanding.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like if you imagined you should have 3 arms, but you only saw you have 2. So you'd go looking to acquire a 3rd arm to feel complete. But the counter-intuitive move is not to go chop off someone's arm and stitch it to your chest, but to realize: "Oh!!!! Duh!!! I should only have 2 arms! So everything is perfect! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" /> "
</p>

<p>
	Happiness is wanting exactly what you presently have.
</p>

<p>
	Unhappiness is wanting something you don't presently have.
</p>

<p>
	It's that simple. But not easy to really grok. The mind will not just surrender its wants. That requires enlightenment. Your very life is tied to your wants. The reason you want anything is because you want to stay alive. So the really counter-intuitive move is to say, "I want to die."
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I don't advise 5-MeO for people who have never done milder psychedelics. AL-LAD is great for newbies but still very powerful.

<title>Kriya Yoga Mega-Thread</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/19678-kriya-yoga-mega-thread/?do=findComment&amp;comment=233604</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	For those of you into Kriya, I would highly recommend that in addition to reading the original Kriya book I suggested, you also read the books of Santata Gamana. I now prefer his more simplified techniques. It's a much more streamlined version of Kriya which I think will be even more effective. I found too much needless complexity and variety in the other way.
</p>

<p>
	Right now my technique stack is very simple:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Mahamudra x3
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Pranayama x24
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Supreme Fire x3
	</li>
	<li>
		One-pointed Concentration for 5 mins
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Eventually, with lots of practice, you should aim for something like the following stack:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Mahamudra x3
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Pranayama x36-x72
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Supreme Fire for 10-20 mins
	</li>
	<li>
		One-pointed Concentration for 10-20 mins
	</li>
	<li>
		(Bonus: Yoni Mudra x3)
	</li>
	<li>
		(Bonus: Kechari mudra)
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	EDIT: ideally, do this stack twice per day. But if you don't have that much time, at least once per day.
</p>

<p>
	Don't attempt to do this second stack right off the bat. It will not be sustainable. You need to gradually build up to it, like with heavy weightlifting.
</p>

<p>
	I think the original book I recommended is still very good as an introduction and foundation because Gamana's books are so short and thin that they do not provide enough information about Kriya to a total newbie. They are aimed at people who have already been initiated in one school or another.
</p>

<p>
	If you are strictly following the original book, that is okay. You can keep doing that if you want. Or you could switch to this more streamlined version like I decided to do. I don't like learning too many complicated techniques. But that's just me. Both ways should work in the end. It's mostly a matter of style. Although I actually think the streamlined version will end up to be more effective because it concentrates your limited time on the most powerful techniques, and less time is wasted on learning new complex techniques.
</p>

	We'll talk more about karma in the future. Yes, it's a deep topic.

<title>What's the difference between awareness and consciousness?</title>

<p>
	I usually use those words interchangeably.
</p>

<p>
	Some teachers like to split hairs about it. I prefer not to because it confuses people.
</p>

<p>
	Suffice it to say, if you knew what awareness/consciousness was, you'd be enlightened. It cannot be explained in words.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is awareness/consciousness. But you are not aware/conscious of what awareness/consciousness is!
</p>

<p>
	If you want to become aware/conscious, place your awareness/consciousness on awareness/consciousness itself for a long time without distraction. Eventually the true nature of awareness/consciousness will dawn. And that will be enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	It does no good to ask people what awareness/consciousness is. You must observe it directly in your experience. There is the answer.
</p>

	A rock hitting you in the head and causing a bruise is consciousness (a rock) interacting with consciousness (your head) causing a change in consciousness (a bruise).

<p>
	1) Ego backlash
</p>

<p>
	2) Sex drive is hard to just stop. In fact you bascially can't. The only way to transcend it is through lots of conscious spiritual puriffication work. I wouldn't worry about sex too much. Don't try to suppress it. Learn to accept it and to fulfill it in healthy ways.
</p>

<p>
	There are other options to the conventional rat race. You could join an ashram or commune.
</p>

<p>
	I have a friend who didn't want to work so he joined the Hare Krishna commune in Tennessee.
</p>

<p>
	I don't necessarily endorse that. Communes can have lots of issues of their own, but it's certainly one viable possibility. Research yourÂ options. Stop thinking inside the rat race box.

<p>
	Reality doesn't work by chance at all. It only seems that way when the linear materialistic mind cannot fathom nonlinear infinity.
</p>

<p>
	When a scientist says "chance" or "random", what he really means is: "It's too complex for me to figureÂ out in detail. And I don't want to admit it because I know best and science knows all.Â So chance."

<p>
	You have to take into account that the people in solitary confinement are already very mentally dysfunction. Many of them are violent offenders and probably have mental illnesses. So solitary for them only makes things worse.
</p>

<p>
	They also do not know how to meditate or self-inquire, or that this is even an option.

<p>
	Just to be clear, I will not be sitting still the whole time like the story of the Buddha. In fact, I am sort of over the whole Zen formal sitting thing. I do not care how I sit or if I move.
</p>

<p>
	My #1 priority will be surrendering of the mind and maintaining contentration on the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	I've sort of stopped caring at this point about using formal techniques. I just sit and focus on the immediate present moment and the fact that consciousness is happening.
</p>

<p>
	I will also be doing lots of 5-MeO to definitively demonstrate its permanent enlightenment potential.
</p>

<p>
	My goal is to show that 5-MeO is the best tool for awakening, along with just sitting and surrendering. I want to demonstrate thatÂ 5-MeO can permanently rewire the "brain". It was already done so for me, but now we will take it to the next level.
</p>

<p>
	I want to accomplish what the Buddha accomplished, but using 5-MeO. Or to show that it isn't possible.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you don't kiss someone's ass doesn't mean you hate him. There is a middle position.Â

<p>
	Respect your teachers, but do not kiss their ass. This isn't complicated. But people love to worship people. Lots of people looking for idealized daddy figures to worship, like Osho.

<p>
	Of course. That's the case with most gurus, and they get off on it.
</p>

<p>
	Did you really expect people to do the hard work of pursuing their own enlightenments? Nope! The whole point of a spiritual communityÂ is to delay enlightenment as long as possible by distractions such as kissing Mooji's ass.

<p>
	Exactly. It's because youÂ don't know yourself that you struggle to be yourself.
</p>

<p>
	What are you really? What do you want from life really? What are your values really?
</p>

<p>
	The point of the inner work is to find out.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make here is to assume that because they were born, they should somehow automatically know themselves. Nope! You gotta work for it. It takes several decades of proactive work to come to know yourself.
