<p>
	You and 99% of humans. That's normal. That's just a consequence of being disconnected from your True Self and enmeshed in the Matrix of culture.
</p>

<p>
	Your survival almost entirely hinges on surviving within the Matrix of culture. Misalignment here can easily get you killed, so ego struggles and suffers a lot to navigate this domain successfully.
</p>

		<p>
			what should person like this do? Try fit in?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice you should do both:
</p>

<p>
	1) Try to fit in within reason. Don't bend over backwards but also don't rock the boat too much. You don't want to be locked in jail, or punched in the face, or sued, or fired by your boss. So in this sense you must fit in within reason. But most people go way beyond this, trying to fit in far too much to the point of becoming a slave to impressing others.
</p>

<p>
	2) Work towards awakening and transcending your biographical and social identity. With this a great relief will come and you'll find yourself able to fit in without struggling to fit in. You will just flow with life and you won't worry to much about playing social roles. Yet at the same time you will still be able to play them, but consciously rather than reactively. So you won't suffer from not fitting in the way you do now. You will find your unique personality and place in life and you will stop caring how others judge you. It will not affect your happiness because you'll be totally grounded in your authentic personality and in your heart.
</p>

<p>
	What people don't realize is that an enormous part of their identity is social. We'll discuss that in future videos. Very few spiritual teachings discuss this aspect of waking up.
</p>

	Any ideas you have of what love is, are not it. Because love is not an idea.

<p>
	If you realize that a causal chain is infinite, it's basically the same as realizing that nothing is caused at all. Because zero and infinity are identical.
</p>

<p>
	You could say there are infinite causes.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could say that everything is its own cause.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could say that everything in uncaused.
</p>

<p>
	Those are just different ways of looking at the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	It's paradoxical because Infinity cannot be captured in symbols or any linear finite framework. Infinity always finds a way to break out of any linear framework such as: A causes B causes C... causes Z. Nope! Cannot be that way. That kind of framework will ALWAYS be partial and incomplete. The Absolute cannot be formalized. Truth must always be bigger than anything you can say about it.

			Do you think that some spiritually-gifted people are discouraged from developing their abilities and never reach their potential?

<p>
	Yes, this can happen, especially with a bad upbringing.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, if a person is truly spiritually gifted they should have some sense of it, however faint and obscured it may be by bad social conditioning. These people should feel like "I am just different from other people." They may not know why yet or how, but they can intuit that they don't quite fit in with dumb society."

<p>
	This question makes no sense.
</p>

<p>
	I don't recommend psychedelics for people under 21 and those who are not emotionally mature. The reason I don't recommend it for people under 21 is because they are generally not emotionally mature or responsible. But there are always exceptions.

<p>
	If you're asking that question, then you probably aren't, unless maybe you had a really dysfunctional childhood.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking, spiritually gifted people will have one or more of the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Find it very easy to meditate or concentrate
	</li>
	<li>
		Are extremely interested in metaphysical and spiritual topics (more so than other topics)
	</li>
	<li>
		Are naturally very loving
	</li>
	<li>
		Really interested in Truth for its own sake
	</li>
	<li>
		Have paranormal abilities: they see auras, angels, and others weird stuff, they have telepathic abilities, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Exceptionally intuitive
	</li>
	<li>
		They have spontaneous kundalini activation/awakenings
	</li>
	<li>
		Are wise beyond their years, wiser than all their peers
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Not all of those need to be present. Just one or two of those is already great.
</p>

Unconscious rulers become tyrants who spread evil and chaos. Case in point: Trump
</p>

<p>
	There is a profound link between spirituality and government.
</p>

<p>
	Of course don't confuse spirituality with organized religion. I am not talking about theocracy.

	Great!
</p>

<p>
	Looking forward to reading a detailed write-up from you once you return.
</p>

<p>
	It will be difficult but worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Hang in there. Don't give up.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If you have not successfully completed at 2 week retreat, start there! 30 days is REALLY REALLY hard.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's awakening. Or at least one degree of it. There's almost always more.
</p>

<p>
	The trick also is integrating it into your everyday life and living in alignment with it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, we've had this similar experience.

</p>

<p>
	At the same time, don't hate culture either. Just become aware of how limited, partial, and artificial it is.
</p>

<p>
	There is no liberation or freedom without transcending one's culture.

<p>
	For me it feels like I am borderline. There's no full ego-death, so the ego can feel uncomfortable as it twists around trying to make sense of things.
</p>

<p>
	Those borderline trips can be some of the worst. You want to find a dose that blasts you past the borderline state but doesn't lead to whiteout or overwhelm. That should be somewhere in the 20-25 mg range for plugged HCl. Oxalate is weaker than HCl so if you're using that you might need to go higher. If your substance is not pure, if it's not white-colored, you'll need a higher dose.
</p>

<p>
	Any color other than white contains impurities.
</p>

<p>
	If you are smoking it, your dose needs to be much lower. Do NOT smoke 20-25mg unless you've done lower doses.
</p>

Don't pre-judge your results.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing in the duality videos suggests you should stop brushing your hair or wiping your ass. It's much more nuanced than that.
</p>

<p>
	It's going to take you lots of experience and contemplation to understand what was said in these duality videos.

<p>
	This could actually be a great opportunity. You could:
</p>

<p>
	1) Use that time to meditate, concentrate, contemplate, or self-inquire.
</p>

<p>
	2) Use that time to start your own life purpose/business. Plan it out at least.
</p>

<p>
	3) Use that time to do something creative like writing a book.
</p>

<p>
	I planned my first business at my 9-5 job during downtime when I had no work to do.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately you should design your life such that you don't have this kind of downtime at work, as it's highly inefficient and a waste of one's life. Make very minute of your work connect to your LP.
</p>

			Leo what would you say to someone who's afraid to awaken for the first time? It seems like you would freak out from all of the realizations hitting you at once. Simultaneously realizing you're God/Everything, you were never born, your family isn't real, and that there isn't even a me sounds like a little much to take in lol. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It will not happen all at once. It will take you years to realize all those facets.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to overcome fear of awakening is via a psychedelic. It's not so hard. You will learn to enjoy ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	There's honestly nothing to fear but fear itself.

<p>
	Well, protection of ego is a very important function. That encompasses all of survival. Do not ignore how utterly important ego is for keeping an organism alive.

<p>
	What I am saying is not simplistic at all. It's infinitely complex.

<p>
	I am not really rejecting the right-wing. All of it is absolutely imporant and it could not be otherwise. The devil must be embraced in love, not demonized.

<p>
	No, that is not what I said. I said that you must look at the low vs high axis rather than the right vs left axis.
</p>

<p>
	You are looking at the wrong axis. Forget for a moment that the right vs left axis even exists. Focus on the low vs high axis.
</p>

<p>
	The key question is: how conscious are you? How universal is your identity?
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious that you are Hitler? No? Then you're not very conscious and your politics will reflect this disowned shadow of yours.

<p>
	We don't have to guess. There are many Jesus-level mystics alive on the planet right now. You can meet them face to face.
</p>

<p>
	People would consider most of them "radical left-wingers."
</p>

<p>
	The issue is complicated somewhat by the fact that one can be deeply enlightened but still not highly developed on the Spiral. Many Eastern mystics are stage Blue. They will be more conservative. But anyone at stage Green or higher will appear very liberal.
</p>

<p>
	Conservative vs liberal is a totally relative designation. It all depends on what you're using as your benchmark. Compared to Jews from 2000 years ago, Ben Shapiro and Fox News is a terrible example of liberalism.
</p>

<p>
	Killing and eating is also you. And every lifeform must kill other lifeforms.
</p>

<p>
	This is what you need to learn to love. This is the real test of your capacity to love. Can you love evil? If not, your love is weak and egoic.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how conveniently you ignore how many lifeforms you kill to sustain yourself.

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The bias of a mystic is Truth, Goodness, Love, Consciousness, and Harmony.
</p>

<p>
	This does not square well with right-wing or conservative politics because the primary appeal of conservativism is ego and closedmindedness.
</p>

<p>
	You never heard of Jesus flipping over the money-lender's table? That was a very political act against the corrupt status quo. For this he was eventually crucified.
</p>

<p>
	Truth and Love upsets the political establishment very much, because it is always run by devils. Devils seek power and money. Mystics seek Truth and Love.
</p>

<p>
	See, the devil hates it when a mystic points him out as a devil. Because a devil can only stay a devil when he has other people and himself confused. But a mystic sees right through a devil because he is the Truth. So the mystic is the highest threat to devils. So the devil's #1 priority is to silence, demonize, and kill the highest mystics. The devil does all this without knowing he is doing it. Because if he knew, he could not do it.
</p>

<p>
	All I'm doing is pointing out devilry to devils. To a devil this might look like a "left-wing bias".
</p>

<p>
	More broadly-speaking, do I have opinions and biases? Of course. Every mind does. That's not the issue. The issue is, how conscious are you of your mind's biases? Are you aware of how selfish your mind is? Are you aware that your entire reasoning faculty has been hijacked by ego?
</p>

<p>
	See, what I'm talking about is not a matter of left or right, it is a meta matter. It is a matter of one's altitude of perspective. You should not be so much concerned with left vs right as high vs low.
</p>

<p>
	Very practically speaking, as you move into Spiral stages Green, Yellow, Turquoise and beyond you will appear to others as much more liberal/left-wing. This is a relative matter. It appears this way simply because high stages of development are very rare and society/culture/politics is dominated by the much lower stages of Red/Blue/Orange. These low stages are extremely mypoic, selfish, reactive, and closeminded. Almost at animal like levels.
</p>

<p>
	Visionary, cutting-edge perspectives appear radical to ordinary folks. This has always been the case. Amongst a horde of slave-owners, someone questioning slavery looks very "left-wing." The slave-owners will have no choice but to demonize the person questioning slavery because it is a direct threat to their survival.
</p>

<title>Questions on identity</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/33948-questions-on-identity/?do=findComment&amp;comment=407740</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	This issue is far deeper than you yet realize.
</p>

<p>
	Your identity as a human is a false one, but you need it to survive in the social domain. So you play various manipulation games, trying to suit your identity to what has social survival value. This makes it impossible to ever be happy about yourself because all these social identities are pure fiction.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate solution is to awaken out of that false identity to your true identity -- as Nothing/God. For this enlightenment is required.
</p>

<p>
	You can make your current identity more authentic and less pathological and less reactive. This will make your life better. But you will never be fully satisfied with that until you finally awaken to the fact that your true identity is Emptiness and formlessness.
</p>

<p>
	You are literally not anything. Or pure consciousness without any properties or forms. You are also litterally the entire universe. So how could any human identity make you satisfied?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	So you are standing in your own way by your attachment to being human.
</p>

<p>
	All you have to do is die. But that is the last thing you want to do. Hence the struggle. Struggle is part of survival.

	You can't dissolve it.

You cannot survive in Northern climates on vegetables alone.

<p>
	This is not a hard limit, but it is a reality for millions of people. And people who come from cold climates have corresponding genetics and culture. Cultures and peoples are adapted to different climates and diets.

Go to the gym and observe people's body types. Trust your eyes, not videos or "science".
</p>

<p>
	Observe females too. You can clearly spot female endomorphs vs ectomorphs. Some girls are super skinny and it's not a diet thing. Some girls are beefy. You can clearly see this by watching porn.
</p>

<p>
	Underlying body type is independent of fat or muscle.
</p>

<p>
	You can also see this in animals. Some breeds of dog are naturally very skinny while others are squat. Compare a grey hound to a pitbull.
</p>

<p>
	I am like a grey hound. Joe Rogan is like a pitbull.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is expecting a grey hound to be like a pitbull. That mistake is on you, not the grey hound. The grey hound is designed for speed. If you were a careful observer, you would notice the perfection of its design rather than judging it.
</p>

<p>
	What you guys are overlooking is that my natural body shape is very tall and lean. Don't compare me to guys like Joe Rogan who are short, squat, and beefy-looking.
</p>

<p>
	To look buff, I would have to add 60 pounds of muscle onto a 6'2" frame. This is not sustainable or healthy for me.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that people have fundamentally different body types (regardless of fat or muscle). There are endomorphs, mesomorphs, and ectomorphs. (And also xenomorphs <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> ) I was always an ectomorph. An ectomorph who happened to be fat due to poor diet.
</p>

<p>
	Muscles do not scale proportionally if your body goes from 5'8" to 6'2". You will become leaner and it will be much harder for you to look buff at 6'2" than at 5'8". Of course there are some tall endomorphs like The Rock. But that ain't me. If you go to the gym and just observe people there, you'll clearly see who is an ectomorph, mesomoroph, endomorph.
</p>

<p>
	Our culture -- especially bro culture which tries to be macho -- devalues ectomorphs while idolizing mesomorphs and endomorphss. But all of these assignments of value is ego.

			My mind tends to be really active in symbols and symbolic imagery, and with the intention of integrating this with my everyday life, I started to wonder what the role of symbols (like the language I am using to get this across to you) is - in the whole network of reality.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is a supremely important question. I encourage you to really contemplate it and research it deeply.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is almost entirely symbolic. But what are symbols? What is language? These are not easy questions to answer but in them lies to key to liberation from the mind.

			LEO, I think you may have a really huge left wing bias.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here is another perspective to consider:
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe it's not about the money but about consciousness and mentality in general? Maybe it's enough of the victim mentality? There are black Americans like Candace Owens who are actually supporting Trump and don't see themselves as victims.  The Democractic Party sure likes to put ideas into the heads of the Black Americans that they are powerless victims, in order to get their votes.
		</p>

		<p>
			Enough is enough of victimhood  - those Black Americans today living in US today are NOT victims.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, I am not a fan of Trump, but I can clearly see how the mainstream media trashed him, and how it backfired on them. To say that he is portrayed accurately by the media is very laughable.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not about playing victim, it's about recognizing systemic inequalities which are de-harmonizing society and creating needless suffering.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just black people who are hurt by it. When people are not treated fairly, they then lash out and we all suffer the consequences collectively.
</p>

<p>
	What I am saying actually requires taking responsibility for the systemic inequalities in our government. It is irresponsible to call people who were economically and racially oppressed for 200 years "victims". That is gaslighting. That's exactly like beating your wife and then telling her, "Oh, stop crying. Stop playing the victim here. It's all just a state of mind. Think positive." That's the definition of devilry.
</p>

<p>
	There are real material inequalities at work here. You're not appreciating the systemic downstream effects of slavery and racism. It doesn't just fix itself in 50 years.
</p>

	It certainly helps, especially when starting out. If only as emotional support and accountability.
</p>

<p>
	Might as well have fun doing it. It tends to be more fun with wings.

Yes, for survival (illusion) cause and effect is great.
</p>

<p>
	But at the level of Absolute Consciousness, cause & effect are a total illusion. This cannot be thought about. You must enter a totally nondual, Absolute state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Cause/effect = duality
</p>

<p>
	If reality is ONE, how can it be caused or be an effect? You must have two parts for cause & effect to be viable. So within duality there is cause & effect but within nonduality there is not.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to phrase it is: cause & effect is relative.
</p>

	He was a con man for most of his life. It's just that power corrupts and makes all personal defects 100x worse.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that Trump has manipulated his media image from the very beginning. His whole public image is a thin lie. He's neither successful, nor powerful, nor a good negotiator, nor a good businessman, etc. It's all bullshit spun by his ego.
</p>

<p>
	Also with age ego can get worse. The devil gets absorbed in his own devilry until he is too far gone. Alex Jones is a good example of this.
</p>

<p>
	I agree that Trump is serving his function for the greater ultimate good, in a twisted sort of way. We need someone to show up how ugly Orange can be.

			The US however, elected Donald Trump. There is a huge part of America, especially rural America that works their asses off for little money and they look down the road and see someone on welfare and the person on welfare is doing quite comparably well as they are. This causes intense hate for welfare and taxes. These people will cause riots before they submit to a socialist system, not understanding that it would benefit them more than just about anyone else. They look at the rich with worship, they dream to be that someday. They buy lottery tickets to entertain the fantasy. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The work that you teach, the work that we are doing is the only solution to this problem. Obama caused a lot of ego backlash. Obama caused Trump.
		</p>

		<p>
			Politics and tax reform needs to come after the hearts of the people have been changed. Giving much attention to politics is putting the cart before the horse right now.

<p>
	Be careful with such stereotypes.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that the majority of Americans voted against Trump! Technically Trump represents a minority of the country. Not only that, but most people voting for Trump were duped by his con game. The media did a really bad job informing voters of Trump's true nature prior to the election. Most people voting for him thought he was a successful business guy at stage Orange, when in fact he is closer to stage Red. America is not that regressive. Most Americans are conscious enough to see that Trump behaves like a devil. Even conservatives see this.
</p>

<p>
	Politics, government, and culture are always evolving. We are in a transition period from Orange to Green. It's going to be a bit rocky but we'll make it. Just because there is ego backlash doesn't mean we give up hope and stop evolving. The ego will always bitching and moaning. We don't let that deter us.
</p>

<p>
	The American political system is very corrupt and does not accurately represent the will of the people. Democracy is being undermined by money and ego. The majority of Americans are for policies like Medicare For All, Free College, ending wars, net neutrality, etc. It's just that corporate interests exert a corrupting influence on elections. In the future this will all change and money in politics will be outlawed.
</p>

<p>
	The hearts of the people are not so bad. It's the corporate influence which is heartless. This is a function of stage Orange materialism running amok. We will grow out it in time. 2020 might be a pivotal election cycle -- the beginning of the end for Orange domination. We'll see.

			One thing about psychedelics is they can take a mind-body into insanity zones. I’ve never wanted to eat or kill people while tripping, yet I’ve been to other insanity zones and that experience has given me a better understanding why people may want to do things that appear to be insane.

<p>
	Right, which shows you the connection between brain chemistry, mind state, and behavior.
</p>

<p>
	What psychedelics reveal is just how many different kinds of states of consciousness there are. Not just a dozen, but millions of radically different states. Various people can be in those various states depending on their brain chemistry, genetics, etc. Some people are stuck in an insane state and that is their reality.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is that some states are far more conducive to awakening and spiritual practice than other states. If your brain is in the right state, waking up is effortlessly easy. Other the other hand, if your brain in the wrong state, nothing you do will wake you up. State is absolutely critical for this work.

<p>
	Yes, this is a huge issue.
</p>

<p>
	What the world needs more than enlightened gurus teaching nonduality is a bridge from where the world is now to a place where folks can just be openminded enough to buy a book about nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I teach a lot of stuff besides strict nonduality.

			Here, let’s say that there is a correlation between race and IQ. That does not mean genetics has anything to do with it. That is an assumption. The correlation could be spurious or there could be an underlying cause. Perhaps genetics, environment or a combination of both.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	If blacks in America received $30 trillion dollars in reparations for slavery (which is just one estimate of the damage done during slavery), the IQ gap would disappear. That's my empirical claim. It could be tested. But of course the whole point is that no one wants to test it. The whole point of the IQ race debate is to deny that blacks are economically abused. The ego wants to blame it on their "inferior genetics", rap music, drugs, sex, black culture, laziness, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The economic unfairness is deliberately overlooked. Because it's too true to admit! It's too much responsibility. What white ego wants to admit that blacks in America incurred $30 trillion dollars worth of abuse? It's too outrageous to admit.
</p>

<p>
	The amazing thing is that blacks have as high an IQ as they do, given the amount of abuse they incurred. A 10 point IQ difference is very small given the historical context and their economic situation.
</p>

<p>
	Hell, one easy way to remove the black IQ gap is to simply change the way we fund public schools. Make all our public schools evenly funded rather than basing the funding off local real estate taxes. This would equalize funding for school in regions with low real estate values. This one change alone could equalize the IQ gap. But no one wants to implement it because it means whites will lose their best schools.
</p>

<p>
	See, blaming genetics is very convenient because then it means we don't have to make any tough policy changes. The ego abuses a victim out of selfishness, then it blame the victim's genetics. This way the ego can feel righteous and superior while it keeps behaving like the selfish devil that it is. The whole purpose of the ego is to prevent honest self-reflection. The devil cannot look himself in the mirror, so he covers up all the mirrors.

	There is some truth to this.
</p>

<p>
	But it's important to teach stage Blue & Orange memes in a healthy, non-pathological, non-exclusionary way.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Jordan Peterson teaches these memes but he laces them with his toxic, judgmental, ethnocentric, dualistic shadow -- which then rubs off on his students.

	You must actually sit down and contemplate through these issues to understand how your mind works. Believing me is next to useless. Sit down with a journal and contemplate questions like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is reason?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is evidence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is data?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is interpretation?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is science?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is truth?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is knowledge?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do we know anything?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do I know I can trust my own mind?
	</li>
	<li>
		What if my mind is lying to me?
	</li>
	<li>
		How is my perspective biased?
	</li>
	<li>
		Where did my beliefs come from?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do I believe the things I believe?
	</li>
	<li>
		If I don't know anything, how should I act?
	</li>
	<li>
		etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	See my video: How To Contemplate Using A Journal
</p>

<p>
	All the answers are inside you. But you have to sit down and dig them out.

<p>
	Yes, it definitely does. But I was sensitive to psychedelics even before 5-MeO. 5-MeO just took my sensitivity through the roof.

			No way lol. I don't know if that would be liberating or depressing, sounds like a weird combination of both.. This must mean that all forms of self consciousness are deluded and therefore causing massive amounts of unhappiness for no reason. People are trying to protect and enhance a self that doesn't even exist through the opinions of others who also don't exist. All the behavior that's dictated on the opinions of others must be bullshit, everything must be bullshit.

<p>
	There is good reason for unhappiness and delusion though. It keeps you alive.
</p>

<p>
	If all delusion was removed tomorrow, society would collapse into anarchy and cannibalism.
</p>

<p>
	You can remove delusion within yourself, but doing it across all of society is unworkable at this point in human evolution. Society is like a house of cards held together with snot (delusion). If you insist too much on cleaning up all the snot, it will all fall apart. So the snot must be cleaned up very carefully and gradually to prevent catastrophic collapse.

<p>
	That only pushes the question back one step.
</p>

<p>
	The question is, why do most people not want to be?
</p>

<p>
	Want, after all, is not a free thing. Your wants are determined by your genetics, environment, and other factors outside your control.
</p>

<p>
	Why do some people want to eat people? Why do some people want to murder people?

<p>
	Every ideological bubble feels self-consistent and "reasonable". As long as you stay inside the bubble and don't go venturing outside.
</p>

<p>
	To create your own reality-bubble all you need to do is exclude, deny, and judge alternative perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	If you notice, Trump is a master at this. He's totally living in his own realty-bubble and you can see how he manipulates himself every day in order to exclude anything that would contradict his bubble. This is extremely dangerous when one has a lot of power.
</p>

<p>
	This is why we make a deep study of epistemology. So that we become self-aware of how our own mind constructs reality-bubbles.

<p>
	What must be deeply understood is that reason serves ego. Reason is NOT a function of truth or facts. Reason is designed to justify whatever serves the ego.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of the alt-right and these genetic IQ debates, a stage Blue/Orange ego is working backwards from its conclusion that European civilization must be superior. (Notice how convenient is it that these egos happen to be European! What a shocker <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> ) So they turn to "science" and "genetics" to solidify that fantasy in their own minds.
</p>

<p>
	That's what all this is really about. It has nothing to do with truth, facts, actual intelligence, or reality.
</p>

<p>
	What all of the alt-right boils down to is identity politics. They are trying to preserve their white male European identity in the face of a culture, society, era which is forcing us to adopt more global and inclusive identities. Their egos are scared of adopting a wider, more inclusive sense of self. That's all. The rest is just their justification games. "Science" and "reason" is used in these games because it lends an air of authority and truthfulness. After all, "How can one be wrong with science on one's side? Science is just objective facts, man! Facts don't care about your feelings. The data doesn't lie." LOL
</p>

<p>
	In reality there is no such thing as "data". There's ego cherry-picking & interpreting data to boost its survival.
</p>

<p>
	See, the devil always cloaks himself in a veneer of "truth".
</p>

	WinterNight is not boasting about it. He's very humble. Watch your projections.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with saying you are enlightened if you in fact are. All it means is that you are conscious of your true nature. That is not an egoic boast, unless you make it so.
</p>

<p>
	Of course plenty of folks on this forum claim to be enlightened when in fact they are not, or their enlightenment is very shallow. But some folks here are genuinely enlightened. Sometimes it's hard to sort the wheat from the chaff because communicating via forum doesn't give enough information in many cases. Although even via a forum, it's still quite clear who is spiritually mature and who isn't. You can tell just from the tone of their posts and their attitude. One of the hallmarks of a spiritually mature person is that he is unreactive and non-judgmental.

<p>
	It's WAY WAY WAY more radical than you can imagine. When you finally realize that you never even existed, that you were never even born, it leaves you totally speechless and baffled. Like, "WTF?????!!!!!! There was never a me? How is that even possible?????"

That experience stayed with her 33 years as of now. Sure she did three years of integration work, but her initial experience was permanent. Could the brain rewire itself that quickly?

<p>
	Lol, she was on the brink of suicide and suffered for YEARS! You are dismissing all that "work".
</p>

<p>
	Yes, if you drive yourself nuts to the brink of suicide and then finally the ego happens to collapse by some fluke instead of you actually killing yourself, the brain can then rewire itself. But it wasn't really quick. It was a process years in the making. It's like an explosion that was building up for years, and then one day it all burst.
</p>

<p>
	And even so, these kinds of cases are extremely rare. They might as well not exist. This is not a reliable strategy for awakening.

			Plus, from (1), your points are true, but it’s just so rare to find relatives enlightened at the same time. 90% of those gifted teachers do not have enlightened relatives. Doesn’t that say something about the correlation between enlightened teachers having gifted genes.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You make an interesting point. But I still think there is a physiological component to spiritual giftedness. It's just damn rare.
</p>

<p>
	How do you explain that many of the most awakened people experienced their awakenings very early in life, often when they are 12 years old, 18 years old, etc. How do you explain people who do one meditation retreat or self-inquire for a few weeks and become enlightened? That is extremely rare and atypical. An average person cannot do that. Otherwise a large percentage of the population would be enlightened, but they just aren't and can't.
</p>

<p>
	More broadly-speaking, how do you explain that less than 0.00001% of humans wake up? This cannot be explained simply by lack of effort. Even within people who do hardcore spiritual practice, STILL, less than 1% deeply awaken. Again, this is not merely due to lack of effort.
</p>

<p>
	There is a deep connection between one's effort in this work and one's spiritual intuition. Why are some people much more spiritually attuned than others? Why are some people totally spiritually clueless? Lack of effort is not enough to explain it because one's willingness to exert effort is directly proportional to one's initial spiritual attunement.
</p>

<p>
	So my claim is that the people who wake up are the ones who start out in life already highly spiritually attuned. Poor upbringing and environment can obscure this attunement, requiring some decades of life experience for the person to realize that they even have this spiritual attunement.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with spiritual attunement is that most people who have it take it completely for granted. They don't know what life is like without it because they've always had it, and they assume everyone else has it too. But most people don't. It's sort of like having a very high IQ or being very tall. You don't even realize that most people are not that way.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I am 6'2". It took me 30 years to realize that not everyone is that tall. To me, being tall feels totally normal. I don't even know what it means to be short. It took me 30 years to realize that the world is designed for short people: hotel showers, all chairs and sofas and benches, airplane seats, sinks, toilets, urinals, jackets, pants, cars, etc. I can't sit comfortably on most chairs because they are designed for short people and I only realized that a few years ago! I didn't realize it because I assumed that all people are the same.

	But your shadow is that which you think you are not.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you think you are an honest person, your shadow is liars. What you must integrate are liars, by realizing you are them.

<p>
	It's hard to say.
</p>

<p>
	I think it's a combination of: genetics, my philosphical mind, years of contemplating deep philosophical matters, my relentless curiosity about nature, my relative lack of emotional obstacles, my good heart, my emotional maturity, self inquiry, and my past breakthroughs on 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation does not feel like it was an important factor for me with respect to tripping.

<p>
	Any kind of personal dev work or spiritual work.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	And just master your life overall. Stop being a child.

<p>
	It's a total bastardization of philosophy.

		</p>

		<p>
			1) If those sages were genetically gifted why aren’t their siblings and parents also spirituality gifted, after all they have the closest resembling genes. Sadhguru was the youngest of thirteen children, yet I hear none of his other siblings are gurus. His parents? Ramana had a brother, what about him? Was he also gifted spiritually?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, even siblings are genetically diverse.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, the genetic factor is still only one factor. Hard training is also required. Sadhguru did yoga from a very early age. Genetics alone is not enough in most cases. All that genetics do is make it easier, not easy.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, witchcraft seems to have some heritable aspects. Children of witches are more likely to have paranormal abilities from my understanding.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			2) Overall, talking about the link between the neural system and awakening leaves a huge problem. What about spontaneous awakening that happened in the past many times. Those took only a few moments, and yet left a permanent awakening experience and a radical new state of consciousness. How did the entire neural system rewire itself in only a matter of a few moments? Because the person often goes from an unconscious depressed, hugely egoic person to an enlightened master in a couple of minutes. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't see any contradiction here. The cases you're describing are extremely rare and they could be explained by the mind web going through a catastrophic collapse and then reconfiguring itself.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, all deep awakening is sudden. But also gradual.
</p>

<p>
	Virtually no one becomes a enlightened master in a couple of minutes. This is pure fantasy. Eckhart Tolle, after his egoic collapse, spent 2 years sitting on a park bench. That was 2 solid years of his brain integrating his breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	The opposite of what you say is true: all enlightened masters that I know spent 10,000+ hours to become a master. And that was on top of their spiritual giftedness!
</p>

<p>
	On top of all this there could additional factors like karma, soul, past-lives, etc. It's way more complex than people think.
</p>

<p>
	Stefan is mistaking genetics with terrible economic inequality and culture.
</p>

<p>
	The IQ difference between whites and blacks is not a genetic problem, it's a social, political, and economic problem. If blacks were not economically and culturally oppressed, their IQ scores would rise by at least as much as their IQ difference between whites and blacks.
</p>

<p>
	The IQ is a very poor measure. IQ tests are culturally biased and they do not accurately measure intelligence, nor is intelligence or IQ a fixed genetic trait like eye color.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot change your eye color but you can change your intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to provide blacks and everyone else in the country with free high quality education. Then human intelligence will shoot through the roof.
</p>

<p>
	It is ironic that people who cite the IQ test are themselves not exhibiting any great intelligence.

	One day I was at Wholefoods shopping for my groceries when I see a dude casually walking by me with a beard and giant DD cup tits.
</p>

<p>
	If that doesn't shake your mind loose of duality I don't know what will.

	African tribes give Iboga to teens. That's some hardcore drug. If a teen can handle Iboga he can handle anything.
</p>

<p>
	Of course some of them probably die.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual growth is not for the cowardly. That said, don't be foolish about it either. I don't recommend psychedelics unless you have a mature mind.
</p>

<p>
	What matters is not your physical age but the maturity of your mind.

<title>Leo's Greatest Insight - Authenticity</title>

<p>
	The paradox is that caring about other people can also become an obstacle. Women especially can develop an ego out of playing a "selfless" helper role.
</p>

<p>
	So you gotta strike a delicate balance.
</p>

<p>
	This whole process is a delicate balancing act. Too much to any one side results in pathology and getting stuck.

<p>
	Seems very likely.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it should be possible to take two brains/minds and merge them into one superbrain/supermind, resulting is some freaky stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a species in which every member's nervous system is interconnected with each other into a literal hive mind. That should produce some interesting new emergent stuff that cannot even be imagined.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute itself will never change. But the extent to which it understands itself, the extent to which is sees the interconnectedness of all form, should vary dramatically.
</p>

<p>
	The formless does not get more complex, but the form does. And since form and formless are one, to be totally omniscient will require a full integration of all form across all time. Which no human being can do no matter how enlightened they get.
</p>

<p>
	To put it another way, you do not fully understand what God is until you have experienced and integrated all form.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox of awakening is that it is Absolute, but it is not total. There are infinite degrees of totality because form extends forever. So you can keep realizing more and more of yourself forever without end. And that's exactly what evolution is doing.
</p>

<p>
	You are being far too flippant and one-dimensional. What you're exhibiting here is an absolutist pathology of awakening. A form of Zen devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Life is multiple-dimensional, infinite, and complex. There's way more to this work than you hold.
</p>

<p>
	What is silly is that you think you've reached some kind of end.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing is never done. Life is reinventing itself all the time, without end. Join the party.
