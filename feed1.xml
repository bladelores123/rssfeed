<p>
	Right. Because that is the True Self!
</p>

<p>
	The point of Neti Neti is to negate everything but the one thing which cannot be negated: existence/consciousness itself.
</p>

<p>
	That emptiness is your true nature. It's what you were before your body/personality was born.
</p>

<p>
	So now just sit and quietly observe that existence/consciousness. But make sure you aren't getting attached to any kind of forms or images of it. Images of it are not it. You must be it directly, without thought or image.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru does yoga trainings but they are not the kind of Kriya yoga I talk about. It's quite different.

<p>
	Via Negativa is not minimalism. It is the path to God through total self-negation, AKA Neti Neti method.
</p>

<p>
	This should not be confused with material minimalism.

</p>

<p>
	I would look more into how to heal whatever emotional trauma you had in your childhood or early adulthood.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like your ego is resisting the profound metaphysical truths the psychedelic is trying to share with you. You have to be comfortable surrendering yourself.

<p>
	There's a very predictable course of action many people here will take:
</p>

<p>
	1) At first you are skeptical of Actualized.org
</p>

<p>
	2) Then you fall in love with Actualized.org
</p>

<p>
	3) Then you start to hate Actualized.org so you can distance yourself from it.
</p>

<p>
	4) And finally you come to understand that everything is inevitable and it could not have been otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	Skimmed over your long story, but this plan of yours sounds super dysfunctional and will lead lots of bad karma.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you re-collect yourself, ground yourself, and begin building a quality life from ground zero on solid principles, not based on fear and doing stuff to please other people.
</p>

<p>
	Truth and integrity are some of your greatest assets as a human being. Don't squander them.

<p>
	Both. You should feel subtle weekly gradual effects and eventually some bigger breakthroughs. The gradual effects can really add up. Which is the whole point. I am more interested in Kriya for the gradual effects than the breakthroughs. I can easily create breakthroughs via psychedelics, but they don't stick so well. Which is why Kriya is important.

<p>
	There are no tricks to focus other than focus.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to seriously work on it, you can start doing concentration practices like I talk about in my video: Concentration vs Meditation
</p>

<p>
	I guess Modafinil is an easy trick for focus. But you shouldn't rely on it too much.

The whole trick is that you need to be able to use existential questions to inform your everyday life, but you also need to be able to partition everyday life from existential matters. It's tricky to explain how to do this. It's like a selective filter you can develop.
</p>

<p>
	One of my most important least-appreciated videos is this one: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/balancing-theory-vs-practice" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/articles/balancing-theory-vs-practice</a>
</p>

<p>
	Where I tried to address this point. This video made many subtle points that few people understand. I recommend watching it several times and really contemplating each point.
</p>

<p>
	Getting really good at converting theory into practice and practice into theory, without getting stuck in either, is like a super-power.

			Also, the 'how' to get something done is one aspect of things, but something else I'm struggling with is the 'what' and even the 'why?' What criteria should I use when choosing what to do with my life? How can I discover a direction for myself and trust myself to come up with the right one? Is the answer basically an avoidance of pain and a pursuit of pleasure? The avoidance of suffering? I'd imagine your life purpose course is good for this one. Intuitively I feel the answer has something to do with 'creating' as that's an act of love.
		</p>

<p>
	It will take you lots of reading, research, and life experience to figure out which things in life are worth pursing. Although I've also addressed this a lot in my videos. Like this one: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/65-core-principles-of-living-the-good-life" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/articles/65-core-principles-of-living-the-good-life</a>
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the LP Course would save you years of groping around in the dark.
</p>

<p>
	No, the answer is not avoidance of pain and pursuit of pleasure. That's what you're already doing, that's what every ego is doing, and it rarely produces good results. You might almost say the answer is the opposite: you must face the things you resist facing.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, creating and love are important pieces of the puzzle.
</p>

<title>Critical Thinking for Objective Truths</title>

You need to be able to both compartmentalize them but also allow one to inform the other.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to practical survival issues like: pursuing sex, finding food, getting a job, running a business, etc. Don't get too philosophical. You can find practical how-to advice and books on each of these topics which can give you step-by-step instructions on what to do. Yes, these books are filled with concepts, but concepts are highly useful, which is why they are everywhere!
</p>

<p>
	Your ability to pursue sex, food, a job, business, etc. has little to do with Truth. Most of those things are accomplished through pragmatic action-taking. You don't need to know the Truth to drive a car successfully. It's just a skill you develop. This skill has right and wrong ways of doing it (relative to the result you want to get). Driving a car successfully requires you obey certain rules. For example, you cannot press the breaks and the gas at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	Relativity does NOT mean: anything goes. If you want specific outcomes, there is a right way and a wrong way to go about it.
</p>

<p>
	There is also Absolute Truth, but this has little do to with achieving simple practical outcomes. You need to be able to distinguish relative and absolute truths. I've have a video about this in the future. Survival and success are accomplished through relative truths.
</p>

	That's why most people never awaken: lack of focus.
</p>

<p>
	Focus is a rare thing these days. Regardless of your personality type. I struggle with focus too.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/8351-cepzeu/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="8351" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/8351-cepzeu/" rel="">@Cepzeu</a> You are missing a few important points:
</p>

<p>
	Firstly, not-knowing. It is okay to say "I don't know". In fact, that is the truth in 99% of cases. So in the case of the Earth or a conspiracy theory, the correct answer isn't to grasp at straws, pretending to like you know something you don't. Just admit, "I don't know if the Earth is round." That is the truth! This is not at all the same as being a FlatEarther. The problem with FlatEarthers is that they definitely believe the Earth is flat and that a round Earth is a vast evil conspiracy by elites.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, learn to distinguish more clearly between belief, experience, inference, and not-knowing. Find the referents of each of these in your experience. Notice when something is a belief for you, when it is an experience, and when you genuinely don't know. For example, how many pounds do I weigh? The truth is, you don't know. So notice that, rather than trying to guess or make shit up.
</p>

<p>
	The key mistake that people make when it comes to epistemology is that they refuse to admit not-knowing because it seems like a bad thing. Culturally we are expected to know, otherwise we are told we are bad or stupid. Well, this is just bullshit. Most people who claim to know things actually are in a worse position than not-knowing, they have wrong knowing.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Reality cannot really be known. Being is prior to knowing. So get used to a lot of not-knowing. Not only is not-knowing not bad, it's the Truth!
</p>

<p>
	Notice that nothing you know about reality is what is (by definition). Knowledge is that which separates you from what is. All knowledge is conceptual. All concepts are symbols. All symbols are not what is. Truth is found non-symbolically.
</p>

<p>
	All scientific and social knowledge is relative, probabilistic, partial, and highly fallible. Nobody actually knows how many people there are on this planet. Nor is it really possible to know because by the time you finish counting them, some of them will have died and new ones born.
</p>

	It ain't just a problem in Islam. Any society below stage Green will have patriarchal views of women, womanhood, and femininity.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are a patriarchal species up until stage Green.
</p>

<p>
	Even in America this problem has not be fully resolved. About half the US population is not evolved enough to understand feminism.
</p>

<p>
	Your views of sex and gender roles are pretty much a straight-up indoctrination from whatever culture you grew up in. Notice you are just like a monkey following the herd. You have almost no original thoughts of your own about gender. Monkey see, monkey believe, monkey do.

	It would definitely be offering systemic solutions.
</p>

<p>
	Read some of the systems thinking books from my book list. That should give you lots of ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Most businesses are not offering systemic solutions to root problems, they are opportunistically seeking max profit.
</p>

<p>
	For example, McDonald's doesn't care about solving systemic problems in human nutrition.

Nevermind what you fear will happen to Germany, what do you actually wish to create? Do you want to create a more Spirally-informed world? Do you want to help people understand each other more simply because that's what you're passionate about? Then do that. That is valid.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make your LP a reaction to anything happening in the world, especially politically.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it more like this: If the world was just fine, what would you enjoy doing?

</p>

<p>
	True happiness isn't what you think it is. True happiness is Truth.
</p>

<p>
	See? Without Truth you do not know how to distinguish between true vs false happiness. Without Truth, you literally have no idea what you are doing. So of course tragedy and catastrophe follows. Which is why really wise people value Truth above all else.

<title>Difference between Contemplation and &quot;armchair&quot; philosophy</title>

Contemplation must be grounded in something: being / direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	To understand how grounding works, see my video: What Is Actuality?
</p>

<p>
	Here's how you understand contemplation: contemplate the question, What is fear?
</p>

<p>
	To do this, you must actually pull up a direct experience of fear and observe it. Armchair philosophy would be theorizing about what fear is. Contemplation would be actually observing fear in your direct experience as it is happening, or perhaps a memory of it.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation is very similar to observation. It must be grounded in the present moment. You must "feel" into what is actually there. If you're still at the level of concepts, that's not good enough.
</p>

<p>
	What is fear REALLY, ACTUALLY?! Not your ideas of fear, but actual fear! Take a good long look and see what pops up.
</p>

<p>
	Once you get good at contemplating something tangible like fear or pain, then you can begin contemplating more abstract things like time or existence.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can want truth. It's actually very important in this work. But you must be extremely careful not to confuse your egoic wants for want of truth. Wanting actual truth is very rare. Mostly when people say they want truth they are lying to themselves. They have confused egoic ideas of truth with actual truth.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with wanting truth is, since you don't actually know what the truth is or means, how can you really know want it?
</p>

<p>
	Even so, it is possible to want truth simply for truth's sake. But that means stomaching the costs to one's ego.
</p>

<p>
	If the truth would kill you, would you still want it?
</p>

<p>
	If not, then you don't really want truth, you want a fantasy of truth (AKA, you want falsehood).
</p>

<p>
	Running and managing a healthy high-consciousness institution is a full-time job. More than that, it requires the commitment of one's whole life. It's not an easy thing to do well and requires enormous levels of development.
</p>

<p>
	I am not developed or conscious enough yet to do this. Nor are most people here.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you focus your energies on developing yourself before you get too carried away with transforming the world.
</p>

<p>
	The videos are designed to be an efficient and cost-free way of learning. You don't really need a brick and mortar self-actualization institution. What you really need is do the inner work. Which of course no one wants to do. Going to a school and passing tests is not it. The whole trick with this work is that it's so delicate and personal it cannot be easily institutionalized.
</p>

<p>
	It's good to have a sense of life purpose that inspires you, but you must also be very careful not to get ahead of your skiis here, or you will easily create a cult which will hurt lots of people.
</p>

<p>
	I have deliberately held off from growing Actualized.org into a big institution. The impulse to do it is always there. But my higher wisdom says No. Making a big organization leads to unconsciousness and devilry.

<p>
	It's usually easier to develop the cognitive line versus the other lines. So you can be cognitively at Yellow but you're not actually able to fully embody it, you're just thinking from it whereas the bulk of your life and emotions are run from Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Why listen a lot to my videos you will start to think from Yellow, but very likely your embodiment will very poor, at Orange or even below. Such is the nature of doing this work through YT videos.
</p>

<p>
	You're always gonna know more than you can embody.

It will basically feel like hell. And I doubt it is sustainable for years at a time because you're gonna run out of essential supplies like food and water.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to plan it out very well and you'd have to select a spot which has sources of food and water.
</p>

<p>
	I know some yogis, for example, live on coconuts which grow nearby them. This kind of thing is easier to pull off in tropical countries I think.
</p>

<p>
	It's much more realistic to live in a small remote cabin which offers heat, small kitchen, pantry, toilet, shower, etc.
</p>

Most guys suck at sex, so it's understandable.
</p>

<p>
	But a guy who knows what he's doing can give you an amazing orgasm just through text messages, never mind in person.

<p>
	By that logic you cannot do anything in life, because there is always zero evidence to support something until you do it.

			JC recommends putting attention on each Chakra as you breath in and out. Apparently there is also a prana energy flow. To me, this feels really awkward. At times, there is a vague sense of prana flow, yet when I am imagining spots in my sacrum, belly, sternum etc. it seems like a fantasy disruption. It's like I'm trying to coordinate breathing, images of energy flow, sensations of energy flow and images of individual Chakra centers. Is it ok to just imagine energy flow up and down the spine? Rather than trying to imagine the energy passing through an images of my sacral vertebrae, then moving on through the abdomen chakra, then passing through the heart chakra etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not so hard to do all that. Just visualize the prana as an electrical fluid flowing up the center of the spine and hitting each chakra quickly along the way.
</p>

<p>
	What is so hard about that?
</p>

<p>
	Your sense is vague because this requires months of practice to get is sharp.
</p>

<p>
	Even moreso than visualization, I would literally try to FEEL the prana shooting up the spine. FEEL it, and it will become a reality soon enough. This is a case of mind over matter. Don't sell your mind short.

<p>
	You say this now only because you happen to feel good right now.

	Let's see how you feel when your dog dies, when your Mom gets cancer, when you lose your job, when you get into a car accident, when someone steals your stuff, when you start to age, when your health deteriorates, when you run out of money, when you have to face death.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea yet just how much life will make you suffer. You feel good right now, but that will definitely not last.
</p>

<p>
	Wake up!

<p>
	This is a total lie.
</p>

<p>
	That person in actually unhappy 95% of the time.
</p>

<p>
	Be ware of how you are so miserable in life you are too unconscious and scared to even admit your own misery.
</p>

<p>
	It is impossible to be unconscious and happy. Period.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically, it takes consciousness just to realize you are unhappy. As but one example, notice how you constantly live in fear. Every day of your life you have a constant cloud of fear and insecurity hanging over you. Fundamentally you feel incomplete and incapable of facing life. Fundamentally you feel broken, not good enough, and unlovable. This is not something that happens occassionally. This is the theme of your entire life!

</p>

<p>
	Do not fool yourself into thinking that any external material acheivement will ever change the above sitution. No matter how much money or sex you get, you will still be afraid, broken, and miserable. And eventually you will want to kill yourself because nothing you try will fix it. That is, unless you know about spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	The devil lies to himself that he is happy being a devil. Therein lies his tragedy. If only he would admit he is a devil, there would be hope. But he is too blind and arrogant to see it. So he continues living in his own self-created hell, calling it heaven.

<p>
	Hero With A Thousand Faces was one of the best books I read as a teen. It had a big impact on me and I still have fond memories of reading it.
</p>

<p>
	But don't expect it to be super practical like a how-to book. It is abstract, high-level wisdom which takes real thought to implement.

<p>
	Paranormal abilities do not work like that. They are not so precise that you can use them that way. It would be like asking, "Can I use my intuition to win the lottery?" No, but you can use your intuition to create a billion dollar business.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of paranormal abilities as material abilities.

<p>
	Hence the beauty of plugging. The dose is as precise as an IV injection. And you get 5-10 minutes to get yourself comfy for the blast-off. And the come-up is silky smooth, yet strong as fuck at a decent dose. And it lasts way longer, allowing for much better contemplation and integration. It also has no nasty smell or taste.
</p>

<p>
	I will verify it with N,N-DMT and let you guys know, but for 5-MeO-DMT and 2C-B it works amazing. Folks who aren't plugging are really missing out on a beautiful thing.

<p>
	Finding a comfortable sitting position is very important. I would say, just find any sitting position you feel comfortable with which allows you to sit for a solid 60 minutes with minimal discomfort.
</p>

<p>
	Right now I've changed up my sitting position to using a Zen-style seize bench with some extra cushioning. So for the pranayamas and breath of fire I am sitting on my knees using that bench. The Mahamudra is done without a bench obviously. That's what I found works best for me.
</p>

<p>
	You could even just do it using a comfy chair.
</p>

<p>
	Again, don't let technical details get in the way of your core practice. Once your core practice is established you can always fine-tune it, change positions, add stuff, remove stuff, etc. But you need the core practice ASAP.

	Just get both versions of your substance (freebase and HCl) so that you're flexible in how to administer it.

<p>
	Don't let practical minutia get in the way of your spirituality. A breakthrough is always worth it.

<p>
	There is no you to protect.
</p>

<p>
	Your question is predicated upon egotism. You are looking to survive. But there is no survival from the Absolute perspective because the Absolute cannot be killed.
</p>

<p>
	You're not getting yet that death is impossible. The only thing that dies are illusions, so there is no problem -- unless you're identified with being an illusion -- in which case you've got a BIG problem.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to change what you're identified with being.

</p>

<p>
	Questions of healthiness are always relative to what you're comparing to.
</p>

<p>
	And canned tuna ain't the same thing as fresh wild Alaskan salmon.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest concern with fish is heavy metal toxicity. You shouldn't eat too much of it.
</p>

<p>
	Stay away from predatory fish like swordfish, tuna, mackerel, shark, bass, etc. as they contain the most heavy metals. Smaller fish are generally safer than bigger fish.

</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga or mindfulness meditation with labeling will blow all that junk out of the water.
</p>

<p>
	What you need is not games but an industrial-grade practice like the two above.
</p>

<p>
	At the very least you could just sit and stare at your hand for 30 minutes straight, and that will do way more for you than those so-called brain training games.
</p>

<p>
	Life is short and full of suffering, so stop dicking around and get serious.

	That's called mysticism. Lol. And it's been around for at least 10,000 years.

That definition of science is woefully inadequate to really understand what science is. Science is a conceptual, symbolic activity. It is impossible to do science without concepts or language. Yet no concepts are ever reality. So how do you resolve that?
</p>

<p>
	Yes, superficially science relies on observation, but then it turns those observations into a conceptual construct. Spirituality also relies on observation, but it turns observation into Being (if done properly) -- which science can never do. Science must always miss being for concept, not-knowing for knowing.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you're gonna know enlightenment, you're wrong. You can only not-know it.
</p>

<p>
	It is critical that you transcend the entire domain of knowledge. What we're talking about with spirituality is NOT knowledge! Notice how big of a problem this presents for you, since all you know, is knowledge!
</p>

<p>
	That's still too much at the level of intellect. You say that, but you're still playing the games because your ego thinks it's getting something valuable out of them.
</p>

<p>
	You haven't fully realized the significance of that statement. Relativity still runs your whole life, and you still treat the relative as though it has absolute value. Which is why you still cling to things, why you still have fear, anger, frustration, worry, negativity, etc. And why you struggle so hard to manipulate life every day, yet you keep failing and failing and disappointing yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The quantity of suffering you experience every day is a measure of how little you are conscious of the above statement. Suffering comes from not being conscious of relativity, treating the relative as absolute.
</p>

But also understand that you have not fully realized the Absolute yet. When your ego-mind is completely deconstructed, you will realize, much to your ego's shock, that all knowledge is conceptual, and not Being or Truth.
</p>

<p>
	It's gonna be quite problematic for you to do science once you're fully conscious that past & future, and cause & effect are not real.
</p>

<p>
	But if you ever reach that far, you also won't care, because by this point you'll be dead.
</p>

<p>
	And then you'll be a happy mystic without a care in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Could you still do science after that? Probably. But would you still want to? You gotta really wonder? Why do you do science at all? Why invest the time into it? What do you lack that it gives you?
</p>

<p>
	Sure, but the map is never the territory. Science is always conceptual, partial, and relative, never Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why most mystics don't care too much about science. It's an endless game of relativity.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with science is that it refuses to recognize its limits. Science is arrogant and foolish in this regard.

<p>
	What needs to be grokked is that consciousness cannot be explained. The problem here is way deeper than science can understand. No knowledge or explanation is ever Truth or Being.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to understand consciousness is to not-know it. But science is not in the business of not-knowing, it's in the business of knowing. So that cannot work.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness cannot be formalized because all formalization is finite while consciousness is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness has already been perfectly explained, so to speak, by mysticism. As soon as you understand consciousness you stop being a scientist and become a mystic by definition.
</p>

The Absolute cannot be known. Anything you know is not it. Being is not knowing, and knowing is not being.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to access Absolute Infinity sit down and stare at your hand. Your hand is it. Stare at it until it stops being your hand. Stop knowing your hand.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is identical to the actual present moment.

	All my pranayamas are the same. I visualize the prana flowing up the spine from chakra 1 to very tip top of the head, and then back down.

<p>
	Ideally you'd sit and concentrate. I'm often short on time so I just get on with life. To me, the value is in the physical rewiring effects of the pranayama. If I had more time I would concentrate more. Do nothing is also viable in my opinion.

<title>The dark side of meditation (having a proper theoretical foundation)</title>

</p>

<p>
	Think about what kind of practical skills would enable your LP. You could train to become a therapist for example, etc.
</p>

<p>
	There are many such opportunities.
</p>

<p>
	Since you live in the real world you're gonna have to build a set of stepping stones which move you up to your ultimate vision. Try to find a way to make a living that aligns with your LP at least somewhat. For example, becoming a therapist might be a great way to learn about helping people with their spiritual problems while also earning good money. Then you could transcend traditional therapy and do more spiritual type of retreats or workshops or coaching.
</p>

<p>
	Actualizing a big LP usually requires several such practical career moves. You can't just become exactly what you want in one step in most cases.
</p>

<p>
	Although if you were really serious, you could beocme a full-time monk and become enlightened within a few years.

<p>
	Definitely try plugging. It's a very different experience from smoking. Although you can't plug toad venom, you'll need synthetic.
</p>

<p>
	Blackout or whiteout is not good. The whole point of 5-MeO is that it's crystal clear and answers all questions. So far you haven't got it.
</p>

<p>
	Also try other psychedelics. LSD or mushrooms can easily give you nondual consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	With psychedelics it's very important that you don't overshoot with your dose. Less is better. At least for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics require at least 10-20 trips to start to get a handle on how they work. 1-5 trips is just not enough because there is too much variabilty between trips. Sometimes trips are duds or go sideways.

</blockquote>

<p>
	My routine is the same as I last posted.
</p>

<p>
	I do 3 sets of Mahamudra, 3 sets of pranayama (36 total pranayama), and 3 breaths of fire. This takes me about 1h 20m
</p>

<p>
	Keep it this simple. Don't over-complicate things. Over time just increase the potency with which you feel and visualize the pranayamas. They are the key to this whole thing. So do them with real intent and feeling. Each breath upwards should feel like it's filling your skull with enlightenment. Suck that prana up your spine and into your skull like it's an actual fluid in your body.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with how you throw around that word "depression". Clinically, it ain't depression until you've had it chronically for 6 months or more.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse an ego backlash or temporary shitty mood or some spiritual emotional upheaval with depression.
</p>

<p>
	There will be many times in your spiritual journey where you feel sad or dejected or lazy or agitated. These usually last for a few days, maybe a week, and then go away. That is all just trickery of the ego-mind. Totally normal.
</p>

<p>
	If it lasts for 3 months straight, okay, now maybe you should give it some serious consideration and stop meditation and seek some help.
</p>

<p>
	In my opinion you'd have a much higher likelihood of success with a year of Kriya yoga.
</p>

<p>
	But I haven't tried 1 year of SDS, so I can't say for sure.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know why you guys are not doing Kriya yoga. It's the most powerful natural technique I've found. All of you should be doing it religiously. Yet I sense that very few of you are.
</p>

<p>
	I've shared so many amazing tools with you guys. Why aren't you using them?

	That is not going to address depression, friends will only mask it.

<p>
	That's good. But that's peanuts compared to what I'm talking about.
</p>

<p>
	Quantity of meditation alone is not enough. You must do more than meditate, you must deconstruct and become conscious of how ego runs your entire life from sunrise to sunset.
</p>

<p>
	You must infuse consciousness into your thinking process and your emoting.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you watch my The 10 Ox Herding Pictures video. It's very important for people like you.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, this is false. Look carefully at the present moment. It has no suffering in it.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is ALL mind. Stop fucking around, stop playing mind games, and observe how your mind is creating suffering. You ARE doing it! Notice this. Your mind is subtly interpreting and projecting negative meaning onto the present moment. You must look carefully to spot yourself doing this. From now on, every time you feel bad, you ask yourself "How am I creating this feeling? What must I believe to feel this way? What must I think to feel this way?"
</p>

<p>
	I can tell you exactly what happened to you. You got lucky and caught a solid glimpse of the Ox because my video blindsided your ego. It hit you out of blue, thus bypassing many egoic defense mechanisms. But your mind did not have a solid enough foundation to permanently hold this insight. The ego figured out a way to reassert itself and now it has doubled its defense mechanisms. It will not allow another easy, lucky break. Now you're gonna have to work for it.
</p>

<p>
	My guess is you are depressed because you want that enlightenment back and yet you don't know how go get it back. You thought catching a glimpse of the Ox was gonna solve all your problems and make life peachy without any serious spiritual work. And now you are starting to see that was just a fantasy. This is why you're depressed.
</p>

<p>
	But the truth is, you just got lucky. It was never really gonna hold because you have not done almost any work decontructing that big fat ego. You cannot be enlightened and maintain all of your habitual daily egoic manipulations, beliefs, attitudes, etc. All of that needs to be broken down piece by piece. You need to undo yourself and your life. The way you carry yourself every minute of every day IS ego! All of your emtional reactions and thought patterns must be purified through patient observation and contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of enlightenment as a magic pill. You must also become deeply conscious of your daily actions, thoughts, and emotions. Enlightnement is only likely to stick if your entire mind is deconstructed. So cheer up and begin that procees.
</p>

<p>
	Cheer up because you were even so lucky as to get a 10 day glimpse. That takes most people YEARS of work. You got it for free.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, finding God and then losing God is very frustrating. But also totally normal and common in this work. Awaking up is not like flipping a light switch, it's more like a kid playing with a light switch, flickering it on and off many many times.
</p>

<title>The End of the Game: Deconstructing the Portals to the Absolute</title>

<p>
	What people fail to get is that consciousness isn't a thing, it is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	If you think of consciousness as a thing, as a substance, as experiential phenomena, as form, or as a state, then it will seem that there is something prior to consciousness. But really there is not. If you hold that there is 1) consciousness, and 2) something prior to it, that's two things! Which is duality.
</p>

<p>
	Regardless of which labels you wish to use, in the end your ultimate understanding of reality better contain only 1 thing! Otherwise it's still a subtle duality.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing is to realize ONENESS, and why it cannot be anything but ONE.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you choose to call that ONE is then a matter of style.
</p>

<p>
	"Consciousness" and "awareness" are very tricky words. Be careful what you assume about these words. Consciousness and awareness are not what you assume they are. You will only appreciate that at the moment of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help suss out what consciousness really is and how it behaves.
</p>

<title>N,N-DMT rectally</title>

<p>
	You would want to use a salt form, not freebase. Most N,N-DMT is freebase. But I have seen salt versions of it.
</p>

<p>
	If your N,N-DMT is unspecified, it's freebase. You have to go out of your way to find salt.
</p>

<p>
	The dose would also be significantly larger than 5-MeO-DMT. It will defintely be less comfortable sticking 100mg+ of chemical in your ass.
