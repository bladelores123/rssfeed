			It's normal when you have a relatively good job. If you're an engineer at Amazon you'll get generous bonuses and shares as well. Which makes sense because engineers provide a lot of value to Amazon. If you're not providing much value don't complain people don't want to share profits with you.

<p>
	The notion that stock options and bonuses go to the ones providing most value is laughable. They go to the most powerful.
</p>

<p>
	But whatever helps you sleep at night.

<p>
	Best way I have found to transcend desires is to deeply satisfy them.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can of course abstain from cravings and desires. But that rarely extinguishes them. They tend to come back.

<p>
	Sounds nice in theory but it just isn't true.
</p>

<p>
	You hunger will not go away from doing the work, but when your belly is filled.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, you will feel better about yourself if you stop procrastinating and start taking action towards solving your desire. But that doesn't satisfy the desire itself. At least not in the basic cases of hunger, sex, etc. Maybe in some very high level cases that could work.
</p>

<p>
	But a desire for sex will not be satisfied by anything other than sex. Or simply by letting the desire go entirely. But it will come back! You can't let go of sex so easily.

He was talking about presenting a strong rhetorical case more than a focus on facts or data. Which is how you persuade people.
</p>

<p>
	The entire reason right-wing media is so persuasive is because they focus on culture war emotional issues. It has nothing to do with truth, facts, data, or policy. The average rube does not care about anything but emotional appeals.

	If you desire a lobster and you desire to catch and cook the lobster but you never get to eat the lobster methinks you will not be pleased, since the whole function of that desire was to fill your belly with lobster.

<p>
	Certainly not. This is not what is being proposed. We are talking about employees. And even then, we are not talking about giving away control but about profit distribution. A CEO would still have most say and control over a company. The janitor at Amazon is not going to make executive business decisions. But he will get a nice salary if the company is successful.
</p>

<p>
	I would also make exceptions for small businesses. If a business has less than 20 or 50 employees, then it will not be regulated as strictly and there will be less or no requirements for significant profit sharing since such businesses have far less social responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org is not buying politicians, etc.

	In practice a high progressive tax rate would be sufficient in most cases. And some wealth tax.

	Investing and loans do have some legit role. The problem is that in today's market they are WAY out of healthy proportion.

<p>
	A hell realm is not for no reason. It's there for the reason that God/YOU wanted to experience it. It's part of Love.
</p>

<p>
	A hell realm is just a bad dream. God dreams infinite dreams, so what is a hell realm to him? Just like a bit of daydreaming to you. Does it bother you when you get a stray daydream? No. It's just a natural function of your mind. You never ask, "But why was I cursed with that evil daydream?"

<p>
	God isn't so invested in the suffering as you are.

	If you showed people levitation, half of them would think you're a fraud/cult leader, half would think you're Satan and want to kill you, and half would start to worship you like blind monkeys.

			Of course. Have you ever worked for a company with a falling share price? It's shit. They pay shit, treat employees poorly, layoff people and all kinds of exciting projects get cancelled. So, even when you're not seeding a startup, it's still very important for the company.

<p>
	Have you heard of Amazon? Their stock prices are soaring yet they still treat their employees like shit.
</p>

<p>
	Look, I'm not saying a serious investor shouldn't get some return on his investment. But a billion times return like today's CEO's? Hell no.
</p>

<p>
	You could cut returns by 95% and things would still be fine. Take Jeffo Bezo's returns down from $200 billion to $50 million. Give the rest to the laborers who do the actual labor. Likewise for all major corporations. There will still be rich CEOs and investors, just not insanely rich. Cap income at $50 mil and the world will be a better place. There is no reason why anyone should hold over $50 mil no matter how many companies they start. If they don't want to work after $50 mil, fuck them. Let them retire. But such people will choose to work anyway because they can't stand retirement, so nothing will be lost.

My challenge to you is this: Do you admit the current system is very leechy? If you say NO, then we have nothing further to discuss. If you say YES, then you tell me how we should change the system to make it less leechy.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course everything is subjective. Objectivity does not exist in my worldview.
</p>

<p>
	In this case value is simply whatever mankind finds valuable or desirable. Whatever helps mankind's survival. Value basically = survival. And all survival is relative. But human survival has many common features such as food, water, sex, land, housing, cars, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Middlemen and resellers, for example, add very little value to the world, thus they are often made disposable by nature. Anything in nature that adds little value eventually gets killed off.
</p>

<p>
	For example, kings got killed off because they didn't add sufficient value to society. They mostly leeched value.

		<p>
			Leo, you often say that you need to be creative to succeed on market and in life. Can you please elaborate - what do you mean by being creative?
		</p>

		<p>
			Does it mean to provide value to people, like, being productive and useful?
		</p>

		<p>
			Does it mean to create something new that did not exist before (find new solution, create new product, new approach, new method, new kind of service)?
		</p>

		<p>
			Or is it a mindset when you are focused on doing something for your authentic reasons?
		</p>

		<p>
			What do you mean by "being creative"?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, creativity is a deep topic. Creativity has many degrees to it.
</p>

<p>
	For the purposes of this thread my definition of creativity is quite a low bar. Just basically any kind of labor that you do which generates value in and of itself without stealing another's labor.
</p>

<p>
	In this case, getting paid to pick strawberries is creative work while getting paid on your shares of ownership of the strawberry company is not creative work, it is leeching value because the core value of the company comes from the strawberry pickers rather than the stock holders. You can easily tell that because if we kill the strawberry pickers the company will not be profitable, but if we kill the stockholders the company will still be just as profitable.
</p>

<p>
	In general our society should be structured such that people who do the most labor get the most rewards. Today it is the other way around. The most rewards go to people who often do literally zero labor. And daytrading is not labor.
</p>

<p>
	See, this is buy design. It's basically a remnant of slavery. Under slavery, the guys who do the most labor get paid zero while the guys who do zero labor get paid everything. And then those guys who get paid everything have the gall to say that they are actually doing labor by whipping the slaves to work.
</p>

<p>
	That is still effectively our system, just abstracted a bit. And most people are in denial about it. Especially those who profit from it.
</p>

<p>
	Ain't it sweet to make money for doing nothing while others slave away?
</p>

<p>
	The big oversight that people like this make is confusing truth with persuasion.
</p>

<p>
	Truth has little to do with persuasion, and what these YT debaters are doing is playing persuasion games. Debate is not a valid method of accessing truth.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something sounds persuasive or reasonable does not make it true.

			Still not clear on this. If someone claims that they can levitate, isn't the notion of 'evidence' is very simple? That I (or other third-party auditors) can literally see the person levitate, that's it. If the guy can float in the air, cool, film it, have 100 scientists observe real-time and upload it to YouTube or something, and rake in the million dollars like Carl mentioned. I'm not a materialist btw, I'm just confused as to why this hasn't happened yet.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Oh, that's very easy to answer.
</p>

<p>
	If someone posted a video of actual, genuine levitation on YT, your mind would simply never believe it to be real. You would call it a hoax.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind will not accept that which runs counter to its deepest metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	You can't get 100 scientists to observe it in real time because no serious scientist would believe it enough to even buy a plane ticket to see it for himself. And even if they did, you would just dismiss those scientists are deluded kooks -- not real scientists, because only a kook would buy a plane ticket to see levitation -- obviously.
</p>

<p>
	So how can you prove something which you know isn't real?
</p>

<p>
	You see? You have shut your eyes and complain that you cannot see and yet you ask us to help you. No one can help you in this case until your realize you are actively shutting your eyes on purpose.

<p>
	That's on you.

<p>
	But if you want to understand EVERYTHING, it would be a good way to do it, rather than this pointless mental masturbation you're currently doing here.

<p>

	See, you ask to know EVERYTHING, but then you recoil in horror and run away. So God himself cannot please you.

<p>
	Take a look at how numbers work. Numbers are infinitely finite. Each number is finite yet there are infinitely many of them, and you can sub-divide each finite number an infinite number of times more, and each of those you can also sub-divide infinite more times, ad infinitum.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is a highly paradoxical thing. Contradiction is not a bug, it's a feature. If thinking about infinity breaks your mind, that's not a mistake, that's the nature of infinity!
</p>

<p>
	Infinity creates a lot of paradox and breaks all finite systems, which is why scientists tend to avoid it and sweep it under the rug. When a physicist encounters an infinity in his calculations/equations he considers it a mistake and looks for a way to hide it. But of course the only mistake is him thinking it was a mistake and trying to hide it.

<p>
	The problem goes way deeper than that. The problem is in how your mind defines "evidence" and "proof". These are not simple notions, these notions are relative to one's metaphysical and epistemic paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that a materialistic paradigm does not have a robust and subtle enough notion of "evidence" and "proof" to accomodate paranormal phenomena, therefore it is blind to them and says they can't exist.
</p>

<p>
	Color can't exist for one who super-glued his eyelids shut.

<p>
	There would also be nothing to stop nothing from creating something.
</p>

<p>
	All things are just imaginations of consciousness. You're still stuck in materialism.
</p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating the relativity of things. Stop assuming that things exist as objective facts. They don't. They only exist if your consciousness holds them.
</p>

<p>
	Even the notion of a "thing" or an object is merely something you dreamed up. If you stop dreaming of objects there will be no objects. Reality is not made out of objects nor is reality as a whole an object itself.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because duality is a part of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	There is possibility for EVERYTHING because reality is unlimited. So what would stop it?
</p>

<p>
	A more conventional explanation would sound like this: nothing cannot stop something from appearing, since to stop a thing requires something to exist. Hence something must come into existence because nothing prevents it.
</p>

<p>
	But even this explanation is not correct because it still assumes a duality between nothing and something. As if something came out of nothing. NO! Something did not come out of nothing. Something has always been nothing. The only full explanation is that something = nothing.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't get it, it's because you haven't awoken to the fact that everything you see and hear is nothing. And no amount of logicking this will do it.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot substitute for lack of awakening by thinking some more.

<p>
	You probably just lack experience. Socialization requires lots of experience, so hatch a plan to gain massive experience. The solution here is pretty simple but you must do it to get results. You can't fix this problem sitting on your couch thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
	I used to have horrible social anxiety. Lots of experience solved it.

<p>
	The purpose is to underscore the entitlement and wrong expectation of life to be easy and served up to you on silver platter.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing personal. But you guys gotta toughen up.

<p>
	Your grandparents where shot at in WWII, and you are complaining about how boring a book is. And you expect me to coddle you on this? Embrace the challenges of self-development.

<p>
	Kids these days expect everything to be easy.

Reframe it more as socialization rather than trying to sell yourself. And enjoy the process.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that you cannot get laid unless you socialize somehow. How you do it is up to you.

<p>
	All survival/life is by definition finite and scarcity-based.
</p>

<p>
	For you to have a puppy means that someone else does not get to have that puppy. No way around this.
</p>

<p>
	Even your preference to live in a democracy is an infringement on someone else's preference to live in a fascist state. The two are mutually exclusive.
</p>

<p>
	Hence life is always full of conflict.

<p>
	A) What you consider creative is too limited. Being creative is not just about being an artist.
</p>

<p>
	B) What I am saying is personal advice. It is not meant to be a solution that fixes the whole world overnight. Yes, if you live in Iraq you will have a hard time being creative.
</p>

<p>
	You need to distinguish between personal advice vs public policy.

<p>
	Don't get me wrong, you can certainly make enormous money by stealing and leeching. But don't be shocked when you try to leech but you get leeched instead.
</p>

<p>
	By being a leech you enter a battle of leech against leech and who gets outleeched is up for grabs.
</p>

<p>
	See, leeching is a finite process whereas creativity is an infinite process. You'd be a fool to align yourself with the finite instead of the infinite.

<p>
	BTW, it may shock you guys, but I may buy some stocks in the future. The only difference is that: A) I don't bullshit myself about the fact that it is leeching, and B) I don't use it as a substitute for my creative work.
</p>

<p>
	The worst thing is when you get the idea that stocks are the way for you to get rich.
</p>

<p>
	For me stocks are mostly an inflation hedge. I'm not looking to get rich off trading them.

If you are attracting unloving girls, there's something weird in your way of attracting them. Diversify your source and be mindful of how you're rejecting loving girls. You can also develop screening questions to screen out unloving girls.
</p>

<p>
	SCREEN your girls before you sleep with them! Say NO to girls who don't fit your standards. Have high standards. Cure your neediness. Set boundaries.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's a self-reinforcing reality bubble that the mind constructs and maintains. Structurally no different than religion or a conspiracy theory. They're all constructed reality bubbles.

<title>Is the pursuit of enlightenment a self-bias?</title>

<p>
	Strictly-speaking, the valuing of enlightenment over non-enlightenment is a bias. God doesn't really care whether it's enlightened or not.
</p>

<p>
	But of all the biases one can have, this one you should worry least about.

<p>
	It is the height of arrogance to think you have a design that will work better and be more fair than a market.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever kind of alt-economy you imagine, I guarantee it will be more evil than what we currently got. Because at least markets have been evolving for thousand of years. While your genius plan has never been tested and wouldn't even work for one month without being massively exploited by devils.

</p>

<p>
	1) Sounds like you are way too needy.
</p>

<p>
	2) Two girls is nothing. Statistically insignificant. Go find more and better. Not all girls are like that.
</p>

<p>
	Cure your neediness, become a strong attractive man, and you will find many sweet girls who will love you and bend over backwards for you.
</p>

<p>
	I've never had a problem finding loving girls. That's like the least problem with girls. If the girls you're with are unloving you got something weird going on. You are probably attracting that kind.
</p>

That is her telling you: "Come fuck me please."
</p>

<p>
	If you do those kind of approaches you will see the girl is super-receptive and your job of picking her up becomes almost effortless.
</p>

<p>
	So don't ever pass those up.
</p>

<p>
	Stop blinking like a fool, grow some balls and approach.

	There is a concept of absolute truth, and then there is actual Absolute Truth. Which is why we capitalize it.

<p>
	That's very challenging.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, you just gotta push yourself into sets and force yourself to keep them going as long as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Try to make your goal to open a set of girls and talk to them for 60 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Keep your talk emotional and illogical. Telling stories is good. Talking about yourself is good.
</p>

<p>
	Most extroverts are masters of talking about nothing and talking about themselves.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be amazed how far you can get your foot in the door just talking about yourself like a pure narcissist.

<p>
	There are many pros and cons to each.
</p>

<p>
	Day pros:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Virtually zero competition
	</li>
	<li>
		Less noise and obstacles, no friends to cock-block. It's easier to have a conversation.
	</li>
	<li>
		Can run into girls who are introverted and/or don't like to drink or party. Higher quality girls overall.
	</li>
	<li>
		Good even if you're alone (without friends or wings)
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Day cons:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Much smaller volume of girls, your approach needs to be well-honed. Waste a lot of time just standing around. Not efficient. Not so good for building up skills.
	</li>
	<li>
		Girls often have boyfriends
	</li>
	<li>
		You're basically only grabbing phone numbers
	</li>
	<li>
		Can't physically escalate much, your game needs to be much more chill and toned down.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Night pros:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Lots more targets. Far more efficient use of your time.
	</li>
	<li>
		Girls are looser and down to fuck
	</li>
	<li>
		Much more likely to be single, less boyfriend rejections.
	</li>
	<li>
		Much better for training and practicing your skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Can get away with sloppy approaches and social awkwardness better
	</li>
	<li>

<p>
	Night cons:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Lots of competition
	</li>
	<li>
		Lots of noise and distractions, hard to hear, hard to talk.
	</li>
	<li>
		Messes with your sleep schedule
	</li>
	<li>
		Need to go for one-night stands, forced to close same-night
	</li>
	<li>
		Drunk girls
	</li>
	<li>
		Friends cockblocking
	</li>
	<li>
		Dancing
	</li>
	<li>
		The club can be very intimidating if you're alone. Wings are more important.
	</li>
	<li>
		Lots of dealing with annoying logistics challenges
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Over all, day game is awesome. The two serious problem with it are:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Far too few hot girls walking around during the day.
	</li>
	<li>
		The best ones are rarely single
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Day game is really only viable in certain locations with high volumes of people and hot girls. Such locations tend to be hard to find. Or you can do day game very sporadically as you do your grocery shopping, etc. But this is far too infrequent to be relied upon. It's more of a bonus you get as a veteran of the game. Once you have built up your skills you should be able to execute a solid approach on any random hot girl you see anywhere during the day.

<p>
	You are talking about a completely different issue, one of PR and legal liability.
</p>

<p>
	I was talking about the entitlement of someone acting outraged when something they didn't pay for gets taken away from them.

	Yup

<p>
	Solid Orange people tend to be more modest about their wealth. Like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet. They have it, but their ego is not so insecure as to need to flaunt it in everyone's face.

<p>
	Tacky displays of obscene wealth and luxury are a hallmark of a Red psyche.

</p>

<p>
	When you saying, "I am racist" or "He is racist" most people intuitively take that to mean: he holds personal racists views, like a KKK member. Which is not at all what systemic racism is.
</p>

<p>
	It would be a lot clearer instead to say: "I am part of a systemically racist system which I'm not doing much to reform."
</p>

<p>
	Systemic racism as a concept needs to be spelled out much better to people because most people are not advanced enough to know what systems thinking is. So when they hear "systemic racism" they simply don't understand it.
</p>

<p>
	I was talking to my family doctor the other week and despite being an educated MD, he did not understand what systemic racism is. He confused it with personal racism and denied it on those grounds. His reasoning was like this: "Well, I'm Indian with brown skin and no one has been personally racist to me in America. All my colleagues are nice to me. Therefore systemic racism is not real."

	It ain't your house until you pay for it.

<p>
	Buys house on loan, surprised Pikachu face when bank takes back its house when loan goes unpaid and gives it someone else who is able to pay.

<p>
	That's like going to a grocery store, opening a bag of chips, eating half the bag in the store and trying to walk out without paying, and then acting outraged when the store manager takes the bag away from you.

	It should not matter as long as you eat enough calories for gaining weight.
</p>

<p>
	1 meal per day is not healthy or reasonable.
</p>

<p>
	You can also eat carbs which are not going to drain your energy, like veggies and fruits. What you want is to avoid heavy refined carbs.

			The Athenians offer the Melians an ultimatum: surrender and pay tribute to Athens, or be destroyed. The Athenians do not wish to waste time arguing over the morality of the situation, because in practice might makes right—or, in their own words, "the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must".
		</p>

		<p>
			The Melians argue that they are a neutral city and not an enemy, so Athens has no need to conquer them. The Athenians counter that if they accept Melos' neutrality and independence, they would look weak: Their subjects would think that they left Melos alone because they were not strong enough to conquer it.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Melians argue that an invasion will alarm the other neutral Greek states, who will become hostile to Athens for fear of being invaded themselves. The Athenians counter that the other Greek states on the mainland are unlikely to act this way, because they are free and independent and thus loath to take up arms against Athens. What worries Athens is potential rebellions in its empire from disgruntled peoples they have already conquered. Conquering Melos will demonstrate Athens' strength and discourage rebellions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Melians argue that it would be shameful and cowardly of them to submit without a fight. The Athenians counter that it is only shameful to submit to an opponent whom one has a reasonable chance of defeating. There is no shame in submitting to an overwhelmingly superior opponent like Athens.

	Most people's method for awakening is like trying to catch fish with bare hands.
</p>

<p>
	Horribly ineffective. And then when you tell them to use a net or stick of dynamite they demonize you for it because they have been brainwashed that unless a fish is caught with bare hands it isn't a real fish.
</p>

<p>
	Human spiritual technology is still in the Dark Ages. Like trying to saw down a tree with your teeth because you saw a beaver do it that way.

<p>
	Yes, of course that's part of it, but it goes much deeper than that. You see, to maintain an "objective" duality between male/female (which isn't real) requires a rigid external system of enforcement. You have to deny that male/female is an imaginary line in the same way that you have to enforce a national boarder.
</p>

<p>
	Many men have homosexual urges which they must deny in order to maintain a tough guy macho appearance because their environment does not allow them the luxury of indulging their feminine side.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, when the majority of guys are straight, you are forced to fit in or get bullied or even killed.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck indulging your feminine side in prison.
</p>

<p>
	Your framing is wrong. It's not random at all.
</p>

<p>
	It's like saying that catching fish is random. Only seems that way to unskilled fishermen.
</p>

<p>
	If you use a stick of dynamite you will catch fish every time. But if you insist on catching fish with your hands, then you will struggle and it will seem random.

			Sorry Leo, but this is such an old antiquated (80s) view of gay men. At least where I live, which a large portion of the population is gay, most gay men are strong, muscular, self-confident and capable. If any gay-bashing bro messed with them, they'd most definitely regret it. I'm sure other places can be different, but I stand by my statement that your views on gay men are honestly insulting.

<p>
	Hehehe....
</p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating the depth of the situation and what I said.
</p>

<p>
	Gayness has been a survival obstacle for men for thousands of years, which is why it is still so stigmatized around the world in nearly all cultures. The fact that some progressive pockets have advanced to a stage of society in the last 20 years where being gay is not a serious liability, that doesn't disprove my point, that proves my point.
</p>

<p>
	Today, in a highly advanced society you can be gay without much problem. But this was not true for most of humam history, and it still is not true in most parts of the world. Hence stage Red and Blue gay stigmas remain.
</p>

<p>
	None of this should be surprising to you. That you cannot see this shows how fucking pampered, entitled, and oblvious you are to the way most humans survive in the world.
</p>

<p>
	If you live in San Francisco, NYC, or LA and act gay, no problem. If you live in Russia or the Middle East and act gay, they might cut your dick off just for fun.
</p>

<p>
	Better yet, try acting gay in prison. See what happens to your survival odds.

<p>
	Being gay is a luxury only recently made available thanks to rising incomes and advancements in civilization. Which is why in countries like Iran the idea of being gay does not even exist. They think gays only live in America. Because to be gay in Iran is suicidal.

	There is nothing mysterious about it. All social norms are there for survival purposes.
</p>

<p>
	For mankind to get to where we are now there had to be strong pressure for masculine/feminine polarity. Blurring that line screwed with the family system.
</p>

<p>
	Nature forces men to compete with other men. Hard to do that when you are gay. Other men will see you as a pussy and dominate you.

	You have to understand that from my vantage point the right-wing worldview is so full of self-deception that I cannot take it seriously. It's too wrong to fix and it is a waste of my life energy to even listen to.

<p>
	But hey, your vantage point may differ. You do you.

Too much theory.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that you are doing this out of unconditional love is laughable. You are a selfish devil looking for low hanging fruit under the guise of "unconditional love".
</p>

<p>
	You can easily find girls who are not into kids or marriage. But they will still want some commitments from you. They are not gonna let you use them like your personal Fleshlight. They got survival needs too and you will hear them whining about it to you. So get used that.

<p>
	There is definitely a point to salvia.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing will show you how deep consciousness goes like salvia.

<p>
	The problem is, can you handle it? A human mind cannot handle the full range of what consciousness can do.

		<p>
			Compelling women to play by those standards, normalizing and rationalizing it, is a selfish driven collective form of abuse at the opposite of genuine love and care. As you stated it, there is no possible win.  A man who's got that objectifying quality can only offer us ashes.

		<p>
			The rules of that game put both gender in the loser bucket. What type of authentic relationship could we have in this context? 
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm totally fine with physical attraction, but the predatory aspect of flesh is a red flag. Humans are subject, not object.
		</p>

<p>
	All this is just the female form of game.
</p>

<p>
	When you decide to actually open your legs for a man, you will absolutely have screened him through your female survival agenda, otherwise you would never sleep with him.
</p>

<p>
	So your position is rank hypocrisy masquerading as love and compassion.
</p>

<p>
	You don't give a damn about low value men.
</p>

<p>
	It's extremely sneaky and convenient of you ladies to whine about how unfair it is that men objectify you. Yet you are attracted to high value males.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between a guy being attracted to big tits vs a girl being attracted to an alpha guy.
</p>

<p>
	Notice yourself playing these sneaky games.

<p>
	Perspective is a relative notion.
</p>

<p>
	It does not exist at the absolute level.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is not a 1st person perspective. That is the ego's illusion. Consciousness is Absolute Infinity.

<p>
	There is a further wrinkle here. Since imagination is reality, you could say that by imagining others you make them "real". In a relative sense. You literally create others in the way you create rocks and cars. So.... if you want to play life like others are real, you can. Nothing is really taken away from you. You can dive into and out of the illusion and enjoy it from both angles.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a video game. It doesn't have to be "real" to be fun. Enjoy the game as a game. Don't take it too seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Not all the time. The illusion of helping you is still powerful and sticky.
</p>

<p>
	But you have to consider that there's literally nothing better to do. Anything you do is equally pointless, so you might as well help people out and follow your passions. People will act nicer towards you and the world will be a nicer place to live.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, selfishness still causes suffering. So living your life selfishly will not feel so good for you even if you are the only one in the Universe. If you rape someone, you will still go to jail.

	From now on, every time I make a mistake or act selfishly, I'll just say: You guys don't get it, I'm actually being hyper strategic.
</p>

<p>
	Like when I slip on a banana peel I was just say, "It's all good guys. I meant to do that. It was all part of my master plan to awaken the world. You're just not woke enough to see it." <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<p>
	"Hey, Leo, why did you steal my money?"

</p>

<p>
	The people who bought stock towards the second half of the upswing are all gonna lose money. And then they will justify it to themselves as: "Well, it was for a good cause. At least we fucked those Wall Street elite."
</p>

<p>
	GameStop and AMC are likely doomed companies that will crash and burn no matter how much you pump or hype them up. These stocks were in the dumps for good reason -- they don't have a bright future.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like you're taking a homeless man on the street and saying, "Let's give this poor guy a bunch of money!" And so you gather a thousand of your friends and pool together $10 million to give this homeless guy. And what does he do with it? He goes to Vegas and loses it all on the roulette table. Because he wasn't homeless by accident, he was homeless because he's utterly irresponsible and mentally challenged.

	If you didn't think I was awake, how could you follow my words to awaken yourself? Before you can awaken you first have to create the fiction that others awoke before you.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			So I'm literally dreaming up someone called Leo who is awake. There is no one called Leo, only in my imagination you exist. And I as God am telling myself to wake up.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yup
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			And if this is true, and no one exists apart from me, then why do I want "others" to wake up if they are just imagination. Its seems very nihilistic, but I'm just confused.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You want "others" to awaken as a distraction from waking up yourself, haha <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	If you really cared about awakening you would stop concerning yourself with the unwokeness of others. Can you see how good a distraction it is to complain about how others are not woke? This is a trap the ego creates for itself because it is to scared to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest mindfucks of awakening is that once you're fully awake you realize there is literally nobody else to help or save. There is no reason to be a teacher or guru. The teacher or guru role is itself a bullshit illusion.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest traps in this work is the fantasy that you will become this great teacher and savior of mankind. Well, that turns out to be an illusion the ego imagined in order to feel a sense of purpose and meaning. The reality is that you awaken and then that's it. There's nothing left to do. There is no one to save, nothing to fix.

<p>
	You can chat up girls simply in classes, hallways, and lecture halls.
</p>

<p>
	You can go to social events on campus. So many social events, networking events, sports events, study groups, gym, yoga, park, etc.

<p>
	Do pickup outside the bars/clubs on the streets.

<p>
	Or just wait a bit. By the time Covid ends you'll be 21 and ready for action.

<p>
	Have some patience. Your life has barely begun and you are acting like you're 65 years old.
</p>

<p>
	Find cute girls in class. Sit next to them. Chat them up. Grab their numbers. Invite them to social events.
</p>

<p>
	If you are clever, you can get access to frat parties by befriending a few hot girls and then telling the frat guys that if they invite you to their party, you will bring 3 hot girls and they will each bring 2 friends. The guys will love you and will want you at all of their parties. Build a contact list of 10 to 20 girls who you are not dating or fucking, but are "just friends" for purposes of party invites.
</p>

<p>
	Stop being lazy and uncreative about this.

<title>The External World Does Exist: Reality is more than Consciousness</title>

		</p>

		<p>
			In a way, my life is paranormal in the sense that it is pure magic, but the idea of time travel, Astral Projection, channeling, precognition, etc. is just imagination to me.  I can test it out any ideas in my imagination to see if they have truth or reality in relation to my Direct Experience.  But if an idea such as paranormal stuff like precognition is something that I can test, doesn't that mean that precognition is an Absolute that exists beyond my own current experience and understanding, or am I inventing precognition as I come to understand it? 
		</p>

		<p>
			The idea of paranormal seems to suggest to me that there is more to reality than I currently conceive or experience.  I get that the only thing I have of reality is Direct Experience and Imagination, but what do you make of paranormal phenomenon like precognition if my Direct Experience and Imagination tell me that it doesn't exist?  If I cannot verify paranormal phenomenon in my own Direct Experience or if I was to be too closed-minded to verify, does that mean paranormal or precognition does not exist since I am only imagining it? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You're confusing things. What I said does not in any way preclude the paranormal. If you see a yogi levitating, that's all fine and good. It's still happening within your bubble of experience. Likewise with any other paranormal phenomenon such as astral travel, telepathy, auras, angels, DMT entities, aliens, channeling, spirit realms, hell realms, clairvoyance, UFOs, mothman whatever.
</p>

<p>
	You are right, there is no difference between the normal and the paranormal other than social convention and definition of terms.
</p>

<p>
	Look at it this way: your fridge is imaginary, but that does not prevent you from going in your kitchen, opening the fridge, and exploring its contents. Likewise with the paranormal.
</p>

<p>
	If you meet an alien, angel, or deity -- they will still be you talking to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You are correct that there is more to what consciousness can do, or what it can imagine, than just the conventional material world. Consciousness can imagine twisted hyperbolic geometry worlds full of aliens and angels and whatever else. But all of that will still always be your own Mind. There is no limit at all to what consciousness can imagine. And it can imagine some insane stuff that you would not believe.
</p>

<p>
	So while I'm saying your current experience is all there is, that does not mean your current experience cannot radically change. It can and it will -- and there is worthwhile stuff to explore. By all means take a rocket ship to Mars, if you dare. You will discover cool and useful stuff. Or if you really want a mindfuck, smoke some salvia.

	This is very problematic since the definitions of "unfit" will be subjective, biased, partisan, and corrupted.

Even judges, down from the local level all the way up to the US Supreme Court, never get elected into office same way politicians do. It the same way that other kinds of professionals such as Medical, healthcare experts and professionals, Attorneys, Architects, Engineers, schoolteachers, college and university professors, school Principals, Vice-Principals, Deans, University Chancellors, members of any of kind of law enforcement, high ranked firefighters, mid to high ranked military soldiers, high-powered executives of huge corporations, etc. don't get picked by being elected by people including laymen.

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	You definitely don't want to attack and judge religious people or they get defensive.
</p>

<p>
	I don't attack religion. But in the end, if I'm talking to a mature person, we can agree religion is cosplay.

<p>
	Sorry, didn't read that far.
</p>

<p>
	In that case, your victim mentality is even more bullshit. As long as there are hot girls around, you can get them by talking to them. Frat boys and jocks are irrelevant. Why do you even think about them?
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Covid sucks for pickup. Wait it out like the rest of us. You are so young the rest of your life is still ahead of you. I didn't even start pickup until 26/27.
</p>

<p>
	What I wouldn't give to be back in college again. OMG, like shooting fish in a teapot with a shotgun.
</p>

<p>
	Cheer up bro. Have a long-view perspective. Covid will end and you will get much better with girls if you work at it. Jocks don't matter. So all is good. If the girls are as slutty as you say, then you should have no problem sleeping with them. Sluttiness works in your favor if you make yourself into a high quality guy. She will fuck a few jocks, then fuck you, see how much better you are, and stick with you.

That means I was right after all." And then they never deconstruct their religious beliefs and attachments -- which is absolutely crucial in this work.
</p>

<p>
	So I would much rather tell a person who loves religion: "Religion is bullshit. Throw it all away. You won't miss anything." rather than telling them how wonderful religion is.
</p>

<p>
	Mostly, religion is a virus and straight-jacket of the mind. Even though beneath that lies some deep truth. But you won't access that truth without being willing to throw away your religion. Hence the paradox of religion.

<p>
	Stop thinking negative thoughts and just go out and talk to more girls. That's the simply solution. You can't think your way out of this situation.
</p>

<p>
	Be very mindful of your negative thoughts. You need to learn to channel your mental energies towards productive action.
</p>

<p>
	Move to a city which has lots of hot girls. Talk to them frequently. Problem solved. If you can't move now, start making plans to move and build the resources to move. This laying of plans will lift your depression.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're depressed is because you have no hope. And the reason you have no hope is because you're not thinking far enough outside the box and taking radical ownership of your life situation.
</p>

<p>
	You are young and there are literally thousands of hot girls you can meet and sleep with if you really wanted to. But you don't really want to do the work for it. Hence you're depressed.
</p>

Reddit is a company with a reputation to unhold. It cannot allow devils to run rampant on its platform. This is not an elitist thing, it's about being non-radical to appeal to mainstream audiences.
</p>

<p>
	What you guys don't get is that once a company is large enough, it has to cater to mainstream tastes. It no longer has the luxury of being radical or niche. This is why CNN cannot be the socialist channel that progressives want. CNN has to cater to a much later audience than radical progressives. If CNN was a socialist channel, it could not have the same level of ubiquity and cultural authority that CNN has. CNN is like mayo or vanilla. It's not supposed to be full of bold flavor because bold flavor turns people off.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise, Reddit and Robinhood cannot allow themselves to become tools of some radical agenda because their goal is to be huge mainstream platforms. Platforms are not supposed to be radical, subversive, or partisan. They need to be vanilla.
</p>

<p>
	Of course both far right and far left people hate this, because they want to weaponize these platforms to attack their enemies. This is why both the far right and far left constantly bash "the mainstream media." They want to turn media into weapons and tools to serve their personal biases and worldviews -- for good or for bad. And of course mainstream organizations refuse to do this. Not because there is some elitist conspiracy to control the world, but because that is the nature of being mainstream.

	The key feature of devils is that they always adapt. Devilry is survival and adaptability, first and foremost. So if you think the devil will just peacefully rot to death in rigidity, you don't understand devilry. The devil will twist itself like a slippery eel.
</p>

<p>
	The real question is, what will the Republican party twist itself into? Because it certainly will not admit its own wrongness.

</p>

<p>
	But consider this point seriously:
</p>

<p>
	The fact that you cannot locate a single example of a truly socialist country out of some 300 on the planet, and hundreds more across history, should give you some pause as to whether such a system is sustainable or even desirable.
</p>

<p>
	I would say the same thing to a libertarian. Where are these wonderful libertarian countries? Oh, they don't exist and never existed? Well, maybe that's because your ideas are more a fantasy/ideology than a workable, scalable system.
</p>

<p>
	You can always make the excuse that it could happen in the future. And it could. But then the burden of proof is on you that such a system is workable. You have to do some heavy lifting there rather than just blindly assuming it will all work out.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarians and socialists alike have a lack of humility about their systems. They just cockily assume, without any hesitation, that it will just work.
</p>
