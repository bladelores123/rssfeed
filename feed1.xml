<p>
	That's probably just the sales pitch to get people interested.
</p>

<p>
	If you teach Spiral Dynamics purely as theory, no one will buy a ticket. People want tangible results.

<p>
	Definitely
</p>

<p>
	At this stage in your life it's very open-ended. This is a great thing because it presents so much opportunity. Yet it can be daunting and paralyzing because you don't know where to start. Lots of research is a much. Explore what's possible. Don't just copy me. There's so much more to expanding consciousness than what I demonstrate or teach.
</p>

<p>
	There are a million ways to help expand consciousness. Find your niche. Think outside the box.

<p>
	Learning how to relax your mind and body is important. Orgasm can only occur when you body is tense.
</p>

<p>
	Controlling your mind is important too. Your mental imagery contributes a lot to how excited you get. You gotta learn to pace yourself, go slow, enjoy, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Of course good foreplay is key too. Perfect your fingering technique. Consider using toys to stimulate her long before the actual act.

<title>Marxist ideas to help create a more conscious society?</title>

<p>
	There's a lot of value there, although also some dangers if turned into an ideology. The thing is, capitalism and neo-liberalism have also been turned into dangerous ideologies. So ideology is a danger all around and is not somehow limited to communists or radical Islamists as American conventional wisdom would have us believe (itself an ideology).
</p>

<p>
	Professor Richard Wolff is a good role-model of a modern Marxist:
</p>

	</div>
</div>

<p>
	He's not always right, but he's more right than many neo-liberals.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem with Marxism was that it was far too advanced and idealistic for its time. It showed up 200 years too early. It could not be implemented because the people implementing it were basically at the level of consciousness and development of totalitarians. So we got totalitarian versions of Marxism which were obviously disastrous. For Marxist ideals to prosper a robust democracy is necessary. Even the US democracy is not yet strong enough to carry it. The US is still not democratic enough.

</p>

<p>
	If you ever decided to do psychedelics you'd have to be very careful about it. Dosing very gradually.
</p>

<p>
	This path requires careful experimentation. Or don't do it at all if you're unable to do it carefully and patiently.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to hurt yourself if you do things recklessly.
</p>

<p>
	Ibogaine should only be done with the help of a professional. It is not an at-home substance.

<p>
	Hehehe, of course a girl will never text you first. Why would she?
</p>

<p>
	Your problem here is that you fundamentally misunderstand how girls works and how texting works.
</p>

<p>
	You as the guy are supposed to proactively pursue her until you win her over. She will resist until you win her over.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. You cannot build attraction via text. If you fail to attract her face-to-face, the texts will go nowhere.
</p>

<p>
	Flake rate for phone numbers is about 90%+. If you're getting phone numbers you need to have REALLY solid face-to-face game AND you need lots of numbers. Hundreds of them. A number means very little. Girls give out their number too easily, even if they have zero intention of dating you.
</p>

<p>
	Your volume is too low and the quality of your face-to-face interactions is too low, failing to be memorable or spark attraction.
</p>

<p>
	Try harder. Make yourself memorable when you approach girls. You need to reach a hook point after opening. The hook point is when you can see she's interested in you. It's a very clear shift in the interaction. Hook point usually takes 3 to 10 minutes to hit. You won't hit it with every girl simply because the chemistry isn't meant to be there with every girl.
</p>

<p>
	I haven't found any good books on that. Flirting cannot be learned logically. You must learn it by doing it in the field.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you find a book that explains it perfectly, you will still be unable to do it in front of a live girl. Because the key to flirting is spontaneity. It can't be premeditated or rehearsed.
</p>

<p>
	It's like golf. You can't learn golf by reading a book.

<p>
	It costs about $2000 total at the cheapest. The machine is only half the cost. The software, accessories, and training programs are as expensive as the machine.
</p>

<p>
	It's not very accessible to ordinary folks, which I why I don't discuss it much. It has a very steep learning curve. You have to be a tech wiz to learn to use it properly. It took me a couple months of serious work to learn to use it. It works great, but it's very difficult to scale that to the masses.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are much more scalable and will take you deeper.

	If you awaken you'll realize you already are living forever. No fancy scientific gadgets required.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

		<p>
			Why is it that the Truth is only ever discovered at the individual level, but that it never percolates through to whole communities/societies?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Because you ARE the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Society is designed to maximize your survival. Which is the opposite of Truth. Without society you couldn't be here contemplating Truth. So literally your Truth seeking is resting on a necessary foundation of social devilry.
</p>

<p>
	The only one who can awaken is a devil. If you didn't start out as a devil there'd be nothing to do.
</p>

<p>
	If everyone was fully awake the game of life would be over. And then who would there be to admire the majesty of God? So it's a catch-22.
</p>

<p>
	It's like this: cops can only exist if criminals exist. If the cops ever succeed in eliminating all the criminals, the cops will starve to death and nothing will be left. This is the case with all dualities. One requires the other otherwise you got nothing.

<p>
	A hand cannot grasp itself.
</p>

<p>
	But it is itself.
</p>

<p>
	God knows itself by being everything that is. Isness & knowing collapse into one, as you'd expect if you assume nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	The reason it must be this way is because knowing is finite. So it cannot encapsulate infinity. By definition, infinity is that which cannot be encapsulated because it is endless and all encapsulations are part of the thing they are trying to encapsulate.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're trying to put all of reality into a cardboard box. But what you're not realizing is that the cardboard box you're using is part of reality itself. So to succeed in putting reality in that cardboard box you'd have to fit your cardboard box inside your cardboard box. Which is obviously impossible.
</p>

<p>
	This is what I call the self-reference problem.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why reality/Truth cannot be grasped with thoughts.
</p>

	Notice how attached you are to the idea that Truth cannot be love.

	This is a bias which will cloud your ability to inquire into the nature of Truth.

<p>
	You consistently advance a dogma against love. This is inappropriate in this work.

<p>
	Let that dogma go and be willing to experience Truth as whatever it might be.

<p>
	Of course Orange and Blue will not like Green & Yellow. But we were not talking about that. We were talking about a society where everyone is at least at Green.
</p>

<p>
	As long as Blue is around there will be big culture wars. Blue vehemently resists and denies Green and above.

<p>
	Fastest way to move past it is to find a new girl.
</p>

<p>
	Since you're at a university you've got tons of new girls all around you. Start talking to them. Go to some parties or social events. That will take your mind off her.
</p>

<p>
	Once you're talking to new girls, you'll care less about the old one.
</p>

<p>
	See this as an opportunity. Since your old relationship was toxic, nothing good would have come from it, so might as well move on. Now you have a chance to find a girl who's better aligned with you. Same goes for her.
</p>

Some places are great for day game, others are terrible.
</p>

<p>
	But also, 100 approaches is so little. You need to be doing 1000s of approaches at night.
</p>

<p>
	How do you flirt? You learn that by doing lots more approaches. You are not going to learn to flirt with 100 approaches.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try doing social circle. Build up a social circle. Once it gets big enough, you will be introduced to new friends and new girls. This tends to work best if you're the socializing type.
</p>

<p>
	Some degree of that is probably normal and not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
	What is more of problem is if you're having regrets being in your current relationship. Maybe something isn't quite the right fit there.
</p>

<p>
	If it's a long relationship I would try to work it out.
</p>

<p>
	If it's a short relationship then maybe you two aren't a good match.

	There will always be some tensions between stages. But the tensions are less brutal and problematic as we go higher.

<p>
	Once you get to Yellow there's no much fighting left.
</p>

<p>
	Each stage up involves less and less fighting and demonizing.
</p>

<p>
	Getting everyone to stage Green is crucial because at that point there will be a lot more peace. Hippies and New Agers aren't known for shooting people.

<p>
	In this case a realistic path forward would involve you first working on commercial videos to build up your skills, experience, and reputation. Then you could branch off and start a company/service where you specifically target more artsy clients who can appreciate what you offer.
</p>

<p>
	When you start business you usually have to send some years cutting your teeth on commercial work.
</p>

<p>
	In fact many filmmakers began their careers working literally on TV commercials. Working on artsy projects is usually something you have to earn.
</p>

<p>
	There are niches for artsy work but you'll have to figure out who those clients would be and what kind of services they need.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't get too attached to your medium. You should be somewhat flexible about your medium. The medium should ultimately serve your highest impact. If your medium is too limiting, consider upgrading to something which more directly serves your impact statement. Why are you so attached to editing being the way for raising collective consciousness. There might be more direct ways of raising collective consciousness than splicing videos.

	Or maybe then you don't really care about raising collective consciousness? Maybe you care more about video? In which case you need to re-think your impact statement.

<p>
	P.S. Funny story, I was house shopping this weekend. At one house I met a real estate lady. She asked me what I do. I said I'm a Youtuber. She said, "OH! You know I just discovered this guy on YT I really like." And I thought to myself, "Oh no, here it comes..." And she said, "Do you know this guy Jordan Peterson? I really love his stuff! I just discovered him." I held my tongue and kept on walking. "Yeah... he's somethin...", I said.

			Could this be an explanation why some people seem to behave in higher levels of the spiral, and then suddenly act out?  As if they'd been hiding a more basic stage and then it lashes out?  Like a "closet" stage hidden since they sense it wouldn't be socially acceptable to be it?

<p>
	Well, I'd probably call that a shadow.
</p>

<p>
	It's common to have at least one color shadow. Common shadows are Green, Orange, or Blue. A shadow here would be one color which triggers you or you love to hate.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you can't stand religious people, that's a Blue shadow. If you can't stand greedy Wall Street types, that's an Orange shadow. If you can't stand hippies and SJWs, that's a Green shadow.

<p>
	That is the nature of all words. They all mean things.

<p>
	The very thing you dislike about the word "devilry" is the very thing I like about it and why I use it. It's provocative. It can be powerful to call a devil a devil to his face.
</p>

<p>
	When I call a viewer a devil, that has a certain affect on their psyche. It punches through the veil. A devil doesn't like being called out.

</p>

<p>
	There is no argument here.
</p>

<p>
	Every word is a category. How you draw your categories is relative to how you want to frame things.

<p>
	For example, you used the category Maya. Which is similar to the category of devilry.

	There exist ways of synthesizing DMT simply from stirring together basic chemical reagents in plastic tubs.

</blockquote>

<p>
	All these terms and framings are relative. You can frame reality in a thousand different ways.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness and deception could be defined as opposites of Consciousness and Being.
</p>

<p>
	Or they could be integrated into a larger unity.
</p>

<p>
	It all depends on how you want to frame things.
</p>

<p>
	We make verbal and conceptual distinctions to do certain intellectual work. Lumping everything into one thing isn't always helpful.
</p>

<p>
	For example, telling someone that Trump is the purest, highest form of consciousness would be highly misleading. It's useful in this case to call Trump a devil.
</p>

			What I am trying to point to is that this is all within Worldness, God accepts all of Worldness. So the closer we get to Godness, if we were to frame it as a duality, would we not more and more come to see the utter Wisdom in all aspects of Isness, including suffering? Would we really call it devilry? Could we infact call it anything at all?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Which is why I said devil = God.
</p>

<p>
	Devilry is a relative term. You have to understand what it means in the context I use it in. I use this as a technical term in my overall framework to refer to acts of blind selfishness and deception.
</p>

<p>
	So when I say, "Trump is a devil" I mean a very specific thing.
</p>

<p>
	Reality has a devilish aspect to it. This is the aspect of trickery and illusion. So deny devilry is silly. Yet of course devilry is just an aspect of God in the big picture.

</p>

<p>
	If your child was sick you would not be dreaming of AI, you'd want a political solution now. Especially since your Canadian neighbors solved this problem 50 years ago.
</p>

<p>

By all means find a female version of the heroine's journey. I openly admit having a male bias to my teachings. That doesn't make the teaching false, just not suitable for your style.

<p>
	Probably. Intrinsic motivation is the best kind.
</p>

<p>
	But also, being self-taught does not contradict school or education. I am self-taught precisely because I had a great formal education.
</p>

<p>
	Formal education primes the pump for self-teaching. The point of school is to teach you how to teach yourself and make you passionate about learning. Of course many schools are bad at doing this. But some succeed.
</p>

<p>
	Going to university does not contradict being self-taught. If you attend university properly you will turn it into a self-teaching program.

<p>
	Obviously not since this problem does not exist in Canada and in most other wealthy developed countries.

<p>
	The problem is not lack of doctors. The problem is the corporate greed and devilry of the US healthcare industry cartel.
</p>

<p>
	There is no reason why everyone in America cannot have decent healthcare. But the healthcare industry would have to make a lot less profit off sick people. There's your real bottleneck.
</p>

<p>
	And no amount of robots or AI will solve this problem. Be careful with your tech fantasies. Tech does not resolve fundamental problems of devilry, it makes them worse.

	Creativity can be damaged in the following sense: if you feel creative urges yet you ignore them because of fear about practical matters like money, etc, and if you do that long enough, eventually you will lose your soul and turn into a zombie.

	Why are you wasting a minute of your life doing anything which isn't your highest creative passion? Can you see how foolish and inefficient such action is? You are pissing millions of dollars of value down the drain this way. Your time should be your most precious commodity. Don't sell it to fools for pennies.

<p>
	That's the voice of God speaking to you, but you're refusing the call.
</p>

<p>
	You're acting too small. You need a much bigger vision. You need a big life purpose, not this wallowing is personal problems bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	God is telling you to make your life about something much bigger than you. But you're too scared so you just wallow around in your own smallness. You should be doing big things with your life. Why aren't you doing them? You could transform the whole world and yet you're just pissing your life away instead.

		How To Unleash Your Ambition
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	And do my LP Course. It's all about this.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you're depressed because you're not actualizing your full greatness. You could be a Christ or a Buddha. What are you waiting for??? Your spirituality is far too timid. Be more bold! Dare to touch people's hearts with your love.

<title>Ego is superior in some things</title>

<p>
	That's right, ego is superior at illusion, lying, and devilry. Which is precisely its function.
</p>

<p>
	You merge the two like so:
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be awakening without survival. So any rejection of survival is ultimately a rejection of God. So by rejecting the devil you reject God. Because the devil is God.
</p>

<p>
	Ego = God
</p>

<p>
	The circle is complete.

<title>Trump Impeachment</title>

<p>
	Balance IS the key. But balance is not taking the mid-point of any given two positions.
</p>

<p>
	Balance can be radical at times.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you're considering slavery vs no slavery, the balanced position is not half-slavery, it is no slavery. The balanced position required a Civil War.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is being able to recognize the Civil War as an act of balance. Most people would be too myopic to see it as such.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the balanced position with regards to Trump is to put him on trial and send him to jail for any crimes he committed. Of course no Trump supporter would consider that balanced or fair. Yet that is the truth of it. The problem is that self-bias warps one's sense of balance, fairness, and truth.
</p>

<p>
	In truth nobody cares about balance or fairness or truth, they care about survival at any costs.
</p>

<p>
	From the ego's POV, "balance" is whatever serves the ego. But that isn't true balance, that's devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why Fox News used to call itself "Fair and Balanced"
</p>

<p>
	It's classic Orwellian devilry. They are precisely not fair and balanced which is why they seek to call themselves such. That's self-deception 101. Which is why Trump likes to call himself "a stable genius". Precisely because he isn't.
</p>

<p>
	An actual stable genius has no need to go around telling people he is a stable genius.
</p>

<p>
	Many private doctors in the US are booked for weeks or months at a time. Even with private plans you still often have to wait. The better the doctor the longer you usually have to wait.
</p>

<p>
	So the idea of immediate care is a myth. Especially for serious conditions.
</p>

<p>
	But also, having to wait 2 weeks is a small price to pay when the alternative might be that you get no coverage at all or you go into medical bankruptcy due to medical bills. Most conditions can wait a few weeks. Emergency rooms are available for urgent stuff.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course the whole point of any universal social service is that it will not be as good as the best private services. But that's a reasonable sacrifice for the greater good of allowing everyone in the country to get the service.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, if you have an elite private plan, a public plan will be a downgrade for you because 330 million people cannot all have an elite service -- by definition. What you must realize though is that your personal survival is not the only issue here. Yes, in a society you have to make a personal sacrifices so that others can have some benefit too.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, if you're super rich higher taxes are bad for you personally. But living in a society requires thinking about bigger issues than just your personal gain.
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally, you have to share your resources in a society. That's what society is. This is what conservatives and libertarians don't understand here. What's required is a paradigm shift where you're not merely thinking about what is maximally beneficial to you and your family, but what is good for society as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	Just because it's good for you and your family to have a giant monopoly which earns you billions of dollars doesn't mean it's good for society. In a sense, you are leeching off society but calling it your own labor.
</p>

<p>
	What needs to be acknowledged is how much a well-functioning society enables your success. Human success does not happen outside of a society. If you were born in the wrong society you would be a slave. Don't forget that. Your elite healthcare plan is not some entitlement you deserve. It's a function of how society is structured, of which you were a lucky beneficially. You could have easily wound up on the losing end of the structure.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you had to wait 3 years to go to a doctor because you couldn't afford it. Well, that happens to people every day.
</p>

	Be careful just off-loading the problem onto some magical AI or robots. AI and robots are not going to magically solve our problems. They will create as many new problems are they solve.

<title>A funny policy proposal // Asynchronous voting</title>

<p>
	Lots of problems with this model.
</p>

<p>
	How would a new political candidate ever get noticed? Voting would be reduced to a perfunctory process which few people would get engaged in. It would be hard to build a consensus for anything new progressive policy proposal.
</p>

<p>
	It's important that we have national debates and conversations about which direction the country should go in. At least election cycles allow for that. Clear cut election cycles make people more engaged I think. Otherwise everything will get muddled and luke-warm. It will be hard to even know who's in office.
</p>

<p>
	It would be better to just make voting day a national holiday.

<title>A Model for Free Global Education (Massively Online)</title>

<p>
	In practice this isn't good enough. There are many online universities already. But most of them are crap. Education involves a lot more than reading books or watching videos. There is a social engagement aspect to it which you cannot replicate online. And just the fact of showing up to a physical classroom is important for motivation.
</p>

<p>
	You can't just sit behind a computer for 12 years watching videos and clicking buttons. This kind of education will produce an army of incel trolls.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org works because it's supplemental. It already assumes you've go a solid base of education to build on top of. And even so, this work would be 10x more powerful in person. But I'm not about to run a physical university for thousands of people, so videos are good enough for the stuff I teach. But even so, most people who watch me are not serious students. They just watch videos randomly and get little results. You can't compare watching videos to a serious in-classroom education. Although of course the content of my videos is more powerful than any university curriculum. The videos are good for me because they allow me to reach a lot more people than I otherwise could. But the downside is my videos will only work on those people who are serious, self-motivated, and self-disciplined. Also the stuff I teach wouldn't be acceptable in any institutional setting, so online is good for that.
</p>

<p>
	Online is a great learning platform, but only for those who are already serious about learning.
</p>

<p>
	I could not be where I am today without the great in-classroom education I got as a teen.
</p>

			While education is good, it is not necessary to herd billions of children into small physical spaces called classes.

		<p>
			Forcing everyone to learn at the same pace is terribly inefficient and frustrating. Inefficiency of education is one of the major reasons for becoming a wage slave.

<p>
	Before we deal with the problem of evolving education to the next level we first have to deal with the more basic problem of providing everyone with education.
</p>

<p>
	Actually, herding billions of children into classrooms is necessary. At least at this point in our evolution. It's got some downsides, but don't forget the massive upsides.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to criticize education. But how would you make it better? And remember, your solution must scale to billions of children. So some fantasy of having children running around in the grass doing whatever they want is not gonna fly. You'd need to design a system which scales to billions of students, is better than the current one, works within realistic budget constraints, and is politically acceptable to most parents. That is a very difficult design problem. Which is why we have the current system we have.

<title>CONFUSION: JP helpful for moving into yellow?</title>

<p>
	Just keep in mind that few people are solidly Green. Many people who lean Green in theory still have huge gaps in their development in practice. They are missing healthy aspects of Blue & Orange, and might have developed Blue and Orange shadows. So in this sense there can be value in learning from quality healthy Blue & Orange sources. This can help round out one's development.
</p>

<p>
	The danger is, if your Blue and Orange sources are impure or dysfunctional (which many of them are), you will tend to adopt their dysfunctions as your own.
</p>

<p>
	If you listen to JP enough you will likely adopt his dysfunctions, confusions, and shadow. He is not a pure source of wisdom. But you can learn from impure sources. You just have to extra careful.
</p>

<p>
	In fact the best way to learn from JP would be to study his impurity. But that is NOT how most people learn from JP.
</p>

<p>
	Studying impurity is an excellent learning technique. Too bad so few people know how to do it. Studying impurity requires being able to discern God from the devil. Which few people know how to do. If you were able to discern God from the devil, you probably wouldn't need to listen to JP.
</p>

<p>
	What Actualized.org teaches you is that you shouldn't see anything as bad.
</p>

<p>
	Or more precisely, realize that "badness" is a projection of your mind. If you think a thing is bad, it becomes bad from your POV.

You need to flirt with her in those 30 second periods every day. Make her laugh and smile. Try teasing her. Then you can ask for her number.
</p>

<p>
	The first girl I dated I met this way. Except I was the one coming and going while she worked at the reception desk. She actually started to flirt with me in those 30 second windows. After two weeks of flirting I asked for her number, she happily gave it, and we went on a restaurant date.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there's no guarantee she will be open to your flirting. Or she just might have a boyfriend or husband already. Check for the wedding ring first. Then just flirt with her assuming she doesn't have a bf.
</p>

<p>
	Those aren't healthy fears. You got some toxic beliefs to drop.
</p>

<p>
	Women do not blackmail men for sleeping with them. LOL
</p>

<p>
	You are projecting your own twisted mind onto women.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you sleep with a woman enough it will get serious and she will want some commitment from you. The mistake is trying to avoid that. Rather embrace it. Or then don't sleep with her more than a few times.

<p>
	Nothing is ever wrong. But everything has consequences.
</p>

<p>
	All attachment will bring suffering. Everything that goes up must come down.
</p>

<p>
	But you can't really learn that lesson without living through it. So knock yourself out with romantic infatuation and see where it gets you.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to be exceptionally wise and spiritually gifted to transcend such things without touching them.

	You've already posted about this in your impeachment thread.
</p>

<p>
	Also mind your biases and ideology.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a forum for arguing about ideology. This is a forum about reflecting on and letting go of one's ideology.
</p>

<p>
	If you keep posting with an ideological tone, you will end up banned.

<title>Concern Regarding Free Healthcare, Free College, and Taxing The Top 1%</title>

<p>
	1) By having free universal care there will be far less need of emergency rooms. Right now emergency rooms are overworked because people can't afford basic preventative care. If your condition is not an emergency they can just tell you to see your doctor the next week.
</p>

<p>
	2) Leaving is not enough, you'd have to renounce your US citizenship. If you want to renouce it, go ahead. But then you forego the benefits of being an American and in a sense you literally have betrayed your own country for money. Some will do that, but most won't because they are too attached to living and doing biz in the US.
</p>

<p>
	3) Your same argument could be made for public schools. Yet schooling is the one thing that keeps humanity out of barbarism. Free college also includes vocational training programs. So if you want to get training to become a pumbler or whatever, that's covered. So free college is not just for nerds or intellectuals. No one is talking about making Harvard free. Only public universities would be free. Private ones would still cost a lot. But they would now have to compete on cost with good free public schools like UCLA, UC Berkeley, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to establish a nice baseline standard for all citizens, so nobody gets totally fucked for life, the way it happens now.
</p>

	You're not going to understand any of this without some reality-shattering awakenings. Psychedelics are your best chance to understand what is being said. You are not going to understand it in your current state of consciousness.

	There is a rare condition which causes some people not feel pain. Such people end up dead before adulthood.

<p>
