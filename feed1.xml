	There's still more to learn. Don't get cocky.
</p>

<p>
	The big picture is all the same, yes.

<p>
	Artists have used psychedelics for a long time.
</p>

<p>
	The very first cave paintings, the earliest human art, was psychedelic shaman art.

<p>
	Very interesting.
</p>

<p>
	Increasing beta is not right though. You want beta to be as low as possible and alpha as high as possible. That's what meditation does.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, coherence is super important.
</p>

<p>
	Gamma is also important.
</p>

<title>Aztec Human Sacrifices</title>

</p>

<p>
	Let's apply your logic to the USA. How come Donald Trump is putting children in cages and bombing the Midde East when we have people like Eckhart Tolle, Adyashanti, and Peter Ralston teaching nonduality?
</p>

<p>
	How come we have Catholic priests molesting children when the truth of nonduality is readily available in thousands of YT videos?
</p>

<p>
	Every culture has vast diversity, from the lowest of the low to the highest of the high.
</p>

<p>
	The wiest people are never in charge, never in politics, never mainstream.
</p>

<p>
	And don't forget stages of development. Although the Aztec shamans accessed nondual states they were not high on the Spiral. They were mostly Purple, Red, and a bit of Blue. A stage Red person may access a mystical state and then cut out your heart and eat it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry about it. Handle your basic survival needs. Later you will shift your balanced back to spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	You can only do whatever your ego will allow you to do. If your basic needs are severely under-served your ego will not allow you to seriously pursue spirituality. Your heart must in whatever you're doing. If your heart is telling to go fuck, the go fuck. Get it out of your system.

It's highly unusual. Girls will do it, but it's not something they do on the regular. You have to really make it smooth like magic. It is highly unnatural to have sex with a person so quickly. Usually a girl would know a guy for weeks or months or years before she would sleep with him. Simply due to the social circumstances of meeting new people.

That's the right attitude. He's just being too creepy and no charm.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, you gotta be an approach machine. High volume. You fish using a net, not a single hook.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta be persistent like he is, and you gotta have a light-hearted attitude. Notice how he doesn't judge himself or even register rejection. A rejection is literally nothing. He's just having fun and taking it easy. That is absolutely essential. You cannot take this shit seriously. You basically must place zero investment in the girl until she's ready to sleep with you.

<title>Family Question for Leo</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31801-family-question-for-leo/?do=findComment&amp;comment=372893</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I don't really actively talk about it unless they ask me, which they rarely do.
</p>

<p>
	My Mom is pretty tolerant of me doing whatever, even though she basically thinks I'm crazy.
</p>

<p>
	My brother is pretty open to it because his wife is pretty heavy into spirituality and he's had some mystical experiences on psychedelics. But mostly he's stuck in stage Orange materialism and scientism. He's open to it in theory, but not motivated to do any actual practices. Recently I introduced him to the Spiral Dynamics model and he found is interesting from a sort of scientific and historical POV.
</p>

<p>
	My Dad I don't communicate with at all for others reasons.
</p>

<p>
	My ex-girlfriend was a bit into it but the metaphysical stuff was just way over her head. Although she loved the psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter. Just do your spiritual work and mostly keep it to yourself or some close friends who are also into it. Definitely do NOT expect your family to be into it or to understand it or to support you in your spiritual journey. Your family wants you to be the old you. They don't want you to be enlightened because it would freak them the fuck out. They cannot handle the mindfuck of you becoming immortal. It is just totally outside their reality. They want to feel like The Matrix is real.
</p>

<p>
	A great way to scratch the itch of sharing is to find a girlfriend or boyfriend who's also into self-actualizing and spirituality. Then you can go real deep with it together. That will be a wild fun ride. But it requires the right person, not just some rando.
</p>

<p>
	There is no cure for closedmindedness. Other than to open one's mind.
</p>

I've worn contacts since middle school and never had any issues.
</p>

<p>
	You should take them off at night when you sleep.
</p>

<p>
	Try different brands to find the best one for you. There are many brands and some are much better than others. My favorite are Proclear. They never get dry.

A girl rejecting you is not a bad experience. Did a girl stab you with a knife? Then I might understand you'd be hesitant.
</p>

<p>
	You are just being weak and playing victim.
</p>

<p>
	You need to take massive action to solve this problem. This requires going out over and over again hundreds of times. Try to enjoy it. Some night you will cry. It's difficult but also rewarding.
</p>

<p>
	It helps to find some friends and wings to roll with. Solo is doable but pretty hard for a newbie. You REALLY have to push yourself when you're solo.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with kids these days is that they have no sense of work ethic. They don't know how to discipline themselves to achieve a big result. You expect everything to be handed to you, otherwise you think it's impossible. Like if I took you by the hand, sat you in the car, drove you to the bar, put you into a good mood, and pushed you to approach girl after girl after girl, and told all your sticking points and all the right ways to deal with girls, you'd have success. But you're not motivated enough to do all that by yourself, to figure it out by yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You have to learn to lead yourself and to be a creative problem-solver. All the resources you could possibly want for learning how to approach and date hot girls is available online. Much of it is free or very affordable to purchase. But see, you're not making use of it. You're not even appreciating that 20 years ago none of this information was available. It was basically unheard of and impossible 20 years ago. But today it's all free knowledge. And yet still you don't put it to use. 20 years ago you would have paid a million dollars for this knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	2g of mushrooms gives me access to the entire universe within 15 minutes.

<p>
	At this point the reason to try new psychedelics for me is purely for experimentation, not for spiritual growth. But I'm still down to experiment. Who knows what I could discover?

Just start by doing your research and be open to finding new stuff.
</p>

<p>
	But also, if you were really serious you could get a job and save up $2k-3k pretty fast. You have to be open to trying stuff and doing what it takes to get results. Don't lock yourself into a victim mindset. There are many ways to solve problems.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe you could even volunteer in a neurofeedback facility in exchange for them letting you use their machine. It costs them nothing to let you use it.
</p>

<p>
	Get creative.

<p>
	Neurofeedback is definitely no placebo.
</p>

<p>
	I use my EEG machine to meditate every day. It's about 10x-100x more effective at meditation than without it. No joke. You feel it after 1 hour.
</p>

<p>
	I don't regret spending $3000 on it.
</p>

<p>
	It's a truly amazing tool, but too expensive and too technical for most people to self-operate it. It took me over a month of technical study to learn to use it properly. But now I get to use it for the rest of my life easily, for free. Strategic thinking FTW!

<p>
	I heard it on a podcast from a psychedelic-researching neuroscientist (can't remember his name or the podcast). He did brain scans which showed the brain rewiring itself and a build-up of tolerance which never fully goes away.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA changes how the serotonin in your brain works. At least that's what he said. Of course I don't have direct experience of that.
</p>

<p>
	To stay on the safe side I would not do more than 10 trips of MDMA unless I hear new research to the contrary.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA causes your brain to dump massive amounts of seritonin (which is what gives you that pleasure high), and then the subsequent crash. You don't want to fuck up your brain's serotonin levels or regulation pathways.
</p>

<p>
	I'd rather stick to LSD, mushrooms, and 5-MeO-DMT -- which seem much safer.
</p>

<p>
	If it's so severe that you're unable to function like normal people, there's a good chance it's physical.
</p>

<p>
	I have been working on improving my own health lately (thyroid issues) and I've been reading about how ADD is correlated with heavy metal toxicity. It's probably not the only factor, but it is definitely 1 of the factors. I'm not sure what all the factors are. You'd have to research that more. Don't expect conventional Western medicine to have a proper root cure for ADD. You'll have to look more to the fringes.

			The main thing that I guess gives me paranoia about neurofeedback is the cost for sure because there are tons of neurofeedback places here in SF. Honestly, my dad doesn’t really want to help me with my psychological stuff now and given that neurofeedback centers tend not to take insurance, they do seem to cost a fortune of money which I don’t have. I also feel like he’s put off because the evidence for this stuff is very much anecdotal (despite me telling him all the flaws with that view and him brushing it off as new agey self help nonsense).

<p>
	Yes, they can be expensive. Usually $100/session or so. But also permanent improvements can come from just 10-20 sessions.
</p>

<p>
	Health ain't free. It can be a good investment. If it actually helps you, you can earn that money back simply from increased productivity.
</p>

<p>
	But you'd have to weigh the pros and cons of that for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I invested $3000 in my own brain training machine. But I'm sorta hardcore and I got money to burn.

<title>Update</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31784-update/?do=findComment&amp;comment=372805</link>
<description><![CDATA[

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/7840-kieranperez/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="7840" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/7840-kieranperez/" rel="">@kieranperez</a> It seems to me that your issue might be physical. If you have serious ADD you might want to research ways of curing that first before you tackle other things.
</p>

<p>
	From what I understand, ADD is often caused by heavy metal toxicity due to impure diet and water.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I'd get a heavy metal toxicity urine test done to make sure you don't have elevated levels of mercury or lead.
</p>

<p>
	I would also check other vital blood work stats to make sure you're not vitamin D deficient, thyroid deficient, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And if all of that came out good, then I would look into EEG neurofeedback training. That's quite effective for ADD. You can find treatment centers all around in San Fran.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I'd spend some serious time researching the root cause of your ADD. Find the best books on ADD treatment and read them. Visit some ADD forums. Find cases of people who successfully cure ADD and follow their steps until you resolve your condition.
</p>

<p>
	ADD could be physically caused. It could also be psychological. And it could also be both at once. So you must look at physical solutions as well as psychological solutions (like meditation).
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is a great practice for reducing monkey mind.
</p>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/232-preetom/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="232" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/232-preetom/" rel="">@Preetom</a> Yes, that's precisely what I'm telling you. 2000 years ago Jesus could have owned slaves and no one would have batted an eye.
</p>

<p>
	Your definiton of enlightenment is literally con-fused. You are conflating states of consciousness + stages of development + lines + types + morality + personal development + emotional awareness + the shadow + mastery.
</p>

<p>
	All of the above must be carefully distinguished from one another. Otherwise your definition of enlightenment becomes so grand that no human on Earth qulifies as enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is NOT moral perfection. Nor is it development. Nor is it emotional mastery. You will have to work on all of that post-enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is strictly only one narrow thing: direct consciousness of Absolute Truth. Nothing else.
</p>

<p>
	It is as though you are defining surgery as the cure to all ills and I am telling you that surgery will not cure all ills but you are insisting it must. This is a dangerous attitude because there will be many ills which surgery cannot cure, so you will then be forced to repress these ills in order for your definiton to be true. And so you will be sick without knowing why.
</p>

<p>
	Waking up does not cure you of dysfunctions which depend on the structure of your mind. Waking up merely detaches you from giving a fuck about the dream. Within the dream rules still apply to you. Hence why you will not be perfect, you can still be addicted to alcohol or rape a woman or own a slave. You can still be ignorant of relative truths and believe in false conspiracy theories. You can still fail to acknowledge the validity of other spiritual traditons. You can still have anger problems. Because all of this relates to the formed dream realm.
</p>

<p>
	The dream realm has importance. You cannot just neglect it unless you are okay will all hell breaking loose.
</p>

<p>
	That is precisely incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	What you call phenomena is actually Absolute Truth, not human perception, and it is not subjective. You think it subjective because you believe you are a human.
</p>

<p>
	Without ego, subjectivity gets recontextualized into the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	There never was subjectivity! It was an illusion.

When you go to a bar, practice being ruthless. When you are at the grocery store, practice being compassionate.
</p>

<p>
	Later you can bring the two together.

</p>

<p>
	Now just do that a couple hundred more times.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry, you will be amazed at how fast your skills improve.
</p>

<p>
	Do not be detered by rejection or awkard moments. Those are all totally normal and they don't matter. Get very used to girls rejecting you or ignoring you.
</p>

<p>
	Work on your body language, strong eye contact, commanding vocal tone, flirty smile, and plowing conservations without ejecting from set.
</p>

<p>
	Your conversations should be slightly sexually charged. Don't be talking to her like a gay friend. She needs to register within 5 minutes that if she gets in a room alone with you, you're gonna bang her. But do not verbalize sex. This is something she must pick up from your flirty manner and the way you look at her.
</p>

<p>
	Practice looking at her like you are a lion looking at a juicy gazelle. Get that chemistry going immediately upon approach. Don't be talking to her about work.
</p>

<p>
	Your goal should be to reach the hook-point in the set, where it is clear that she's attracted to you. It usually takes 0-5 minutes to hit the attraction hook-point. Attraction happens surprisingly fast.
</p>

You feel that way because your love and compassion is so weak.
</p>

<p>
	And don't confuse compassion with being a doormat or a lazy bum or a weak man.
</p>

<p>
	It's because life is ruthless that we practice love. A warrior must have heart. Love and consciousness is true strength.

Do it sober.
</p>

<p>
	I did over 3000 approaches and never bought 1 alcoholic drink in my entire life.
</p>

<p>
	Try to stay away from canned openers. Just push yourself to approach and improvise gibber-jabber. Try to plow through and maintain the girl's attention for as long as possible. Do not eject. You keep talking to her until she tells you to fuck off or leaves. Plowing is key. That will build your conversation skills. You will suck a first, but you will also quickly improve if you make the commit to never eject from a set.
</p>

<p>
	Try to open to some sets and make them last for 30-60 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make your conversations logical. They can literally be any random useless nonsensical stuff, like how much you hate Trump or how much you love pizza. Talk, talk, talk your mouth off. Allow yourself to let loose and be emotional and opinionated. You can also make up fantastical shit like: "I'm going to buy everyone in this bar a kangaroo. Help me pick out a name for my kangaroo."
</p>

<p>
	Here's the key to night-game conversation: The words coming out of your mouth do not have to make any sense.

<title>Can you Get Girls That Are More Physically Attractive Than You?</title>

Think of a list of what makes a woman high value to a man. What makes a woman a prize?
</p>

<p>
	Now step in the woman's shoes. What is a man's value to her? Make a list. Why would a woman need a man in here life at all? What makes a man a prize?
</p>

<p>
	Hint: these are NOT symmetrical! You must stop thinking about this using your dick. A beautiful face/body is not why a woman is looking for a man. Nor does she need a man with a long dick. She has much more important needs he must meet.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this from the woman's POV until you understand what needs a woman has. Then you will understand what value means here.
</p>

<p>
	A woman's value is much more physical. A man's value is much more social. A man who is weak, lazy, socially out of touch, and incapable of leading other men is the equivalent of an ugly woman.
</p>

<p>
	What makes a man ugly is NOT his physical appreance but his meek attitude. Which is exactly why incels can't get laid. It's not their looks, it's their ugly attitudes.
</p>

<p>
	You need to develop the attitude of a winner or a boss or a warrior.
</p>

<p>
	What do all girls fantasize about? A knight in shining armor who will sweep her off her feet and show her a whole new world. Looks are not what make a warrior.
</p>

<title>Skepticism &amp; Solipsism Crisis - Help!</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31738-skepticism-solipsism-crisis-help/?do=findComment&amp;comment=372064</link>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/582-petarka/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="582" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/582-petarka/" rel="">@PetarKa</a> You're making two big mistakes:
</p>

<p>
	1) You are unwittingly assuming the validity of your skeptical stance, which itself is unknown. But you are taking it as known.
</p>

<p>
	You are also not questioning the validity of your thoughts and emotional reactions. So what even if skepticism is true and reality is not real? Why would that be bad or a problem? Since problems and value-judgments would also ve unreal? Why are you taking your emotions seriously? Doubt your emotions more!
</p>

<p>
	2) Solipsism is incorrect. Nonduality is like solipsism but also very different in important ways. It's not that other people are your subjective experience, it's that you are an illusion and therefore there is no such thing as subjective experience at all, there is only God or Being. Interaction with others continues as it always has because you are all people. What a person is simply gets recontextualized. A person is a hallucination in the mind of God, just like your person is.
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally your problem here is that your skepticism is not thorough enough. Ego has turned skepticism into a conceptual ideology, which is the opposite of enlightenment. The ego is not seriously undermining itself here. Your entire inquiry is coming from ego and assuming ego!
</p>

<p>
	You'd be closer to Truth if you just dropped all ideas and sat there looking at your hand, not knowing anything.
</p>

<p>
	Your inquiry is not properly grounded, it is too abstract and conceptual.
</p>

<p>
	Stop knowing things!
</p>

<p>
	Ground yourself in the actuality of the present moment. See my video: What Is Actuality?
</p>

<p>
	What you can do is meditate or do Kriya yoga. Shut that mind off. It is only digging itself deeper.
</p>

<title>Do I enjoy rejecting girls?</title>

Go approach those girls! They're not gonna do the work for you, and approaching is always uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
	The women in clubs are ordinary women. They aren't trash. That's your own mind making up bullshit excuses for why not to approach.
</p>

<p>
	Be very mindful of your self-talk in a club. Do NOT trust it! All of that is pure fear-based excuses.
</p>

<p>
	You will be amazed at the types of sweet and cool girls you'll meet in clubs. Clubs are not for whores or drunks. Ordinary girls go there. Girls are social creatures so they just get dragged along by their friends. If you approach enough girls you will be some great ones in bars and clubs. Girls in bars and clubs are not necessarily regulars. They might be there once a year for a birthday party or bachelorette party or for a work event.
</p>

<p>
	Before holding all these prejudices, go approach 1000 girls in clubs with an open mind. Then approach another 1000 girls in bars. Then approach another 200 girls at the mall. Then compare where the best girls come from based on your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If you go to clubs to enjoy dancing, what do you think the girls are doing? They enjoy dancing more than you! And yet you judge them for it. According to your twisted logic when you go to a club to enjoy dancing, you are not trash, you are better than everyone, but the girl is a trashy whore.
</p>

<p>
	If you're looking for a dog, go to the pet store.
</p>

<p>
	Frankly, with your rotten attitude you don't even deserve a trashy girl. Stop acting like you're too cool for school.
</p>

<title>How to rid myself of controlling/owning my spouse?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Pay very close attention to just what control is and how little of it you have. This doesn't just apply to people but all of life.
</p>

<p>
	This question of control is a very deep existential one. Notice how the ego keeps trying to control life but keeps failing and getting upset at itself for not having the control it wants.
</p>

<p>
	What is in control of you? Are you in control of yourself? Then why do you keep failing to control yourself? What is control? Why do you want control?
</p>

<p>
	Patiently contemplate all that.
</p>

<p>
	Ravers don't last. They crash and burn and turn to other drugs. Most raves don't even have real pure MDMA but other substitutes. And most ravers don't even know the difference.

</p>

<p>
	Which is why I do not talk about MDMA as a tool for consciousness work. It is not a true psychedelic, it is in a class of its own.
</p>

<p>
	Stick to LSD, mushrooms, and 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is the closest psychedelic to enlightenment. Nothing comes as close.

	He doesn't use the word God outwardly because he has a tight-lipped and sober style.

<title>Can you Get Girls That Are More Physically Attractive Than You?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31725-can-you-get-girls-that-are-more-physically-attractive-than-you/?do=findComment&amp;comment=371955</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I've attracted girls (8s, 9s, and even 10s) who were way more physically attractive than me.
</p>

<p>
	Because girls aren't primarily attracted by a guy's looks, but by his persona, charm, charisma, confidence, wit, leadership qualities, intellect, social status, and strength.
</p>

<p>
	If you go out a lot and approach a lot you will attract 8s and 9s fairly regularly. Which is not to say you'll be able to close all of them, because closing requires having perfect logistics, which usually isn't possible. So you will lose a lot of 8s and 9s, but at least you'll get the validation of having attracted them. You will be able to tell, for example, that if the logistics had been good, she would have eagerly slept with you. And from that point, it's only a matter of time until the logistics line up and you'll sleep with your first 8 or 9.
</p>

<p>
	10s are just so rare it's not even worth thinking about.
</p>

<p>
	All that's required is that you go out a lot, approach a lot, and have good game. If you can set up good logistics (by living very close to bars/clubs) that will up your chances of pulling girls by a factor of 2x-10x. Logistics are super important if you want to get laid a lot.
</p>

<p>
	Basically any girl that's an 8 or above is a model-quality girl, as she can make easy money off her looks, and often does or did so in the past. She can be a model, actress, stripper, pornstar, webcam girl, go-go dancer, hostess, etc. But don't forget, a lot of these girls can be annoying to deal with as they tend to spoiled rotten by men. These girls know how to use their looks to manipulate men. They know they are hot and they know the value of that in our society. Handling girls like that requires a serious boss/pimp attitude. A weak man cannot handle a girl like that.
</p>

<p>
	The rule of thumb is, whatever quality of girl you feel you deserve and can boss around, is the quality of girl you will get. Anything above that you will not be able to handle because your confidence is too low. Hot girls have high confidence. As a guy, in order to attract a girl your confidence and value must be higher than hers. If you want to date models, you need to develop balls of steel and a delusional, borderline narcissistic degree of self-confidence and self-love. You need to be unfazed and just have an I-don't-give-a-fuck attitude.
</p>

<p>
	Or become famous. Famous guys get hot girls easily.
</p>

<p>
	Because reality is a giant mind. There is no possibility of stuff unless it is occurring inside a mind.
</p>

<p>
	Here's the kicker: there actually is no difference between sentience/non-sentience, nonphysical/physical, conscious/unconscious, mental/non-mental. All of those are relative distinctions which collapse into one nameless unity. This unity is what is. It is pure Absolute Truth. Which is not different from something and nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is just one giant fat zero. Like it never even happened. Because there is no one to tell the difference between happening and non-happening. Another way to phrase it is... it seems to you that reality happened because you think it did.

<p>
	Calling it presence is extremely deceptive though.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone thinks they have presence so they don't think they're missing anything.
</p>

<p>
	Whereas with God, it's clear to most people that they are missing an experience of God.
</p>

<p>
	Take someone like Sam Harris. He has meditated for years, he even has some degree of awakening to no-self, and he would readily agree with you about presence, but he is not conscious of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	Presence or awareness are way too neutral of terms. These terms actually make many Buddhists believe there is no God.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The answer is to tread carefully and not build cult-like organizational structures and to stress an integral, dogma-free approach.
</p>

<p>
	The answer is also to not get ahead of your skiis, to maintain high personal integrity and to not lust after power, sex, money, fame, or success.
</p>

<p>
	The answer is to do shadow work even after awakening and to be sensitive to the collateral damage you cause. And to not go on a crusade.

Just look at the yin-yang image. It's both nondual and dual at the same times because it depends on how you want to look at it.
</p>

<p>
	Free will vs not-free-will is a duality which collapses when you're in nondual consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can tap into the infinite creativity of God, since you are him. But that does not necessary mean you can create mountains out of thin air.

<title>mixing Vippassana and Self Inquiry</title>

</p>

<p>
	I had my first mystical experience doing just that: Vipassana followed by self-inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	I find self-inquiry not to be effective unless one's mind is already in the zone and highly mindful. So, for example, I find it bad practice to being a meditation retreat with self-inquiry because the mind is not focused enough yet to have any breakthrough. So my retreats begin with lots of Vipassana. The self-inquiry is best saved towards the end.
</p>

<p>
	Vipassana is sorta like sharping the knife and self-inquiry is more like using it to slit the throat. Without Vipassana you've got a butter knife.
</p>

<title>Will girls not have sex outside of a relationship in hgihschool?</title>

<p>
	A "relationship" in high school is a rather fickle notion. More like a 2-week affair.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you're not gonna be doing one-night stands or same night lays in high school. You gotta build up to it through friendship in a way that you wouldn't need to do if you're hunting for girls at a bar or club.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see why you'd even want that in high school. Just get yourself a girlfriend. You don't need to sleep around with your entire class. If you're gonna be having sex with a girl in high school your intent should be to be in a relationship with her. Why you making it such a big chore? Relationships are fun. A relationship (in high school) is not marriage. It's a flimsy thing.

</p>

<p>
	So if you're really serious about it, start by building your spiritual experience.

<p>
	Enlightenment will not even come close to eradicating all issues.

	You are already well on your way to developing a massive enlightened shadow.

	An entire book could be written on post-enlightenment shadow issues and pathologies.

<p>
	This is a very dangerous misconception. By equating enlightenment with moral perfection and an impossiblity of shadow, you set yourself up to be a great Zen Devil, full of much shadow. Because once your enlightenment happens, you'll still have a TON of shadow issues left unresolved, but your fantasy of perfection will force you to deny this fact and so you will suppress these shadow issues even deeper, doubling the size of your shadow and become a half-enlightened devil.
</p>

<p>
	Even the greatest most enlightened masters have shadows and pathologies.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be a fool. Nothing in this work is automatic.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea what imperfections Ramana Maharshi had. You just have a fantasy of him in your mind. It's easy to appear to have no imperfections when living one's entire life in a cave. The real test comes when you live an active life, where you have leadership obligations, duties, money, fame, sex, luxury, family, children, business, politics, and other things to deal with. When a hot girl with big tits comes and rubs them on you, let's see how long your enlightenment lasts.

But Orange is dangerous enough as it is. And when those 60% Blue evolve into Orange, that will be a big problem as Orange will run hog-wild. That could easily end humanity.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if all of Africa, South America, Middle East, and Asia became Orange! That's pretty scary. And you know it's coming unless we kill ourselves even sooner.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I'm not worried about Green. We need a thousand times more Green to balance out all the Orange that's yet to come.

<p>
	It is precisely what it wants to be.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality requires nothing outside itself to define it. It exists without non-existence. It is light without dark. Nonduality has no opposite.

<p>
	You are still thinking of nonduality dualistically.

</p>

<p>
	If life is suffering, what is it when you are not suffering?
</p>

<p>
	Are you suffering right this moment?
</p>

<p>
	Yet the moment still is.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to over-generalize and call everything suffering. That chair is not suffering, for example.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that there are many times throughout the day when you are not suffering. Which shows you that your perspective is not totally right.

<p>
	60%+ of the world population is at Blue or below. So I'd be more worried about that and Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Much of Green radicalism is actually a reaction against the stubbornness of Orange from evolving into Green.
</p>

<p>
	If Orange took environmental issues and income inequality seriously, then there would be much less incentive for Green radicals.

<p>
	Infinity does not necessarily work the way your mind imagines.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is infinitely intelligent because it has unlimited power. In short, there is nothing to stop from being infinitely intelligent, so it is!
</p>

<p>
	What you must understand is that there are no constraints on reality as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not random, arbitrary, or chaotic. It is fine-tuned by an infinite intellect which cannot ever be fully articulated, but you can become conscious that this is so.

	If you were me, you'd be sitting here typing this sentence with no sense of being you. Since to be me is to be fully me, not you.
</p>

<p>
	What it means to be you is to not see through anyone else's eyes but your own.
</p>

<p>
	If you were able to see through my eyes, you'd be me! Which is precisely what I am: you looking through my eyes! And you are me looking through your eyes.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	This is possible precisely because the perceiver (True Self) is nothing.

<p>
	He has much to learn about the ultimate nature of existence. That is not his wheelhouse. You don't go to me to ask how to build a rocketship to Mars and you don't go to Elon Musk to ask about God.

	Or he builds a cult which goes off the rails and drives many people into delusion.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to take into account about every organization is how it plays out after the leader is dead. How much evil will it spread? If the leader enlightens 1000 people in his lifetime but leaves an organization which enslaves and brainwashes 100,000, it's not longer clear that it was a net positive.
</p>

<p>
	Is the Catholic church a net positive or net negative? Hard to say. The math is very complex in that equation. Jesus might be rolling in his grave.

Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, Muhammad, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's no accident that such people are revered as gods among men. And serve a role models for millions. Because to truly pull off such a thing requires you become god-like.
</p>

<p>
	In practice no leader is perfect. Many of them have secret hidden shadow sides which you don't see in public.
</p>

<p>
	For example Gandhi was an amazing leader but not without some personal shadow issues. Same with Martin Luther King Jr.
</p>

<p>
	Also take note how many of these leaders were killed by the ignorant hoards. That should tell you something.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I find Gandhi very inspiring. He gave up his whole life for his mission.

If thats it then also those old Tibetan Monks or anyone/anything from past history, which we have not seen, did probably not exist and is only made up from this dream?
		</p>

		<p>
			Because if they existed, then this dream has been going on for millions of years continously having experienced so many different lifeforms since the first cell, and that would not be meaningless then and also if it has been going on for millions of years then probably we experience this dream againn in another ego and that is there comes up the question in what ego and where on this planet are we going to experience it again?
		</p>

		<p>
			And if there are infinite amount of other dreams, then what determines in which one our special feeling ego is going to appear again, which factors? There is no ego? But there must be because I am experiencing one, what happens after death is mysterious, hopefully I'll find out having a beautiful 5 Meo DMT experience too, but for now I am curious and hope this sparks a healthy conversation here

<p>
	This is too deep a topic to get into here. If you want to discuss that, start a new thread about it.
</p>

<p>
	For now what I'll say it this: you can spend decades reading various scriptures and various claims by monks and yogis. But all of it will be hearsay and you will have no clue if what they are saying is true or not. You must ground this work in your own direct experience. Are there aliens? Are there past lives? Is there karma? Is there an escape from rebirth? Is there a God? Are there angels? -- the truth is you don't know until such time you are directly experiencing it. So rather than speculating about this stuff, invest your time having direct experience of the things you speak of.
</p>

<p>
	Try this rule on for the next week: Do not speak of anything you have not directly experienced. Have you experienced a kangaroo? Then don't speak of it. Have you experienced being gay? Then don't speak of it. Have you experienced outer space? Then don't speak of it. Notice how this one rule cuts out a lot of bullshit from your mind. This is called being grounded. You must constantly reground yourself in this work because the tendency is to float off into metaphysical speculations, and then even worse, debate over those metaphysical speculations.
</p>

<p>
	If you really wish to honor the monks and yogis of the past then devote more time to meditation, contemplation, yoga, and psychedelics. That is the only way to validate the things they said.
</p>

He seems quite culty (although also genuinely enlightened). Not much new under the sun.
</p>

<p>
	Pathological enlightenment is much more common than people assume.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, watch out for young gurus especially. They are prone to be Zen Devils.
</p>

<p>
	Upgrading society is good. The problem is, it's much harder to do than almost anyone realizes. Good intentions, pleasant words, and even enlightenment is not enough. It takes conscious leadership and a degree of self-mastery which very few people have.

</p>

<p>
	The ego is incredibly strong and it will not allow you get rid of meaning so easily. If only it were so easy!
</p>

<p>
	It is a fact that no meaning whatsoever exists. This fact is very threatening to your way of life and your survival program. Which is why you are reacting with all those emotions. Those emotions are designed to get you back on track with your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	The fact that life is meaningless is itself meaningless, hence it is not bad or depressing.
</p>

<p>
	In order to be depressed you must assign negative meaning to life. So ironically the reason you're feeling so bad is because you are trapped inside an illusory world of (negative) meaning.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move is to surrender all meaning. But ego is not gonna let that happen without a huge stink.
</p>

<p>
	In a few days you will forget you ever watched that video and you will fall back asleep into your unconscious life, as though nothing ever happened. That's how sneaky the ego is. It will just sweep all this truth under the rug, out of your awareness.
</p>

<p>
	What you should be really worried about is falling back asleep, not losing meaning.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, ancient man was selfish, barbaric, and vicious like a wild dog.
</p>

<p>
	The end of slavery is a modern evolutionary advance.
</p>

<p>
	You have to consider the bigger picture. Consciousness not only has depth but breathed. God could go really deep by creating 5 enlightened masters or go very broad by creating 50,000 idoits hanging out on Facebook. Those 50,000 idiots might amount to more consciousness in the long run because they will breed like rabbits and share a technology like 5-MeO-DMT which then leads to 50,000 awakenings rather than just 5.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is highly nonlinear and counter-intuitive. Evolution is not a straightforward afair. What looks like steps backward are actually necessary steps forward. Therein lies the genius of the overall design. It's like a queen sacrifice in a masterful chess game.
</p>

<p>
	To understand God's plan you must look an infinite number of moves ahead.

</p>

<p>
	Just observe more rather than speculate.
</p>

<p>
	Sit down and observe what resistance is, how it works, when it arises, why it arises, when it passes, why it passes, what function is serves, what it feels like, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Those are all great questions.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of contemplation is not deconstruction per se but to get to the truth of the matter, to see what is actually the case.
</p>

<p>
	What is actually the case about resistance? To answer that you must spend a lot of time observing it. The mistake is speculating about it based on your assumptions and theories. Stop doing that! Rather, observe it from scratch and make mental note of what you see.
</p>

<p>
	Study it like a rare tropical butterfly under a microscope which you are seeing for the first time in your life.
</p>
