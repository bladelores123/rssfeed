<title>Suicidal thoughts</title>

<p>
	Have all the thoughts you want. But take good care of your physical body.
</p>

<p>
	The ego mind will play all sorts of tricks when it gets cornered. Suicidal thoughts are just one trick up its sleeve.
</p>

<p>
	There is a long tradition of Dark Night of the Soul for mystics. A classic stage. I think the key to overcoming it is just to make a commitment to carry on with the work, suffer mindfully, and commit to not harming your physical body.
</p>

<p>
	No thoughts are to be taken seriously. That's also another trick. Do not buy into your own stories. All of that is ultimately delusion.
</p>

<p>
	And also always remember that reality is infinitely Good, Beautiful, Perfect, and Complete. Suffering is there because of the ego. You can learn to let go of suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said above, there is a proper time for it. No one is telling you to strategize everything all the time.
</p>

<p>
	At first your satori will be weak, so yes you will get sucked back into ego. That's why post-satori practice is required.
</p>

<p>
	Satori will profoundly change your life strategies.

</p>

<p>
	There is a time and place for both. When you are sitting on the cushion trying to attain satori, that's the wrong time to be strategic. That's a time to enter no-mind.
</p>

<p>
	Then there will be a time in your day or week to be strategic.

They have various repercussions.
</p>

<p>
	Criminalizing eating meat will simply not be a viable policy.
</p>

<p>
	Policy only works if it's viable in the long-run and actually creates a tangible improvement of some kind for the majority of people. Policies which lead to less efficiency will get weeded out by natural selection.
</p>

<p>
	You are free to have all sorts of beliefs and opinions about what will work best, but ultimately your ideas must be tested in the real world to see if they will actually fly.
</p>

<p>
	Someone who believes the white race is superior -- that's not gonna fly in the real world. Not in the 21st century.

<p>
	Those of you struggling with self-inquiry: it's almost impossible to do self-inquiry with a crazy monkey mind. You must first calm the mind down. For many people this could takes several years of meditation, as it did for me. Unless your mind is still and capable of extended periods of focus, self-inquiry will likely not work for you.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is very effective at mechanically silencing the monkey mind. Then you can do powerful inquiry.

</p>

<p>
	Since most people will judge us relatively, it's best not to give psychedelics a bad name. Otherwise it hurts the cause of making psychedelics more widely accepted. By using psychedelics sloppily, you ruin a good thing for other folks.

	No, I was lamenting the lack of maturity in the user.

	My talks onÂ psychedelics are actually reserved.
</p>

<p>
	The issue is that no amount of disclaimers can stop ignorance from unfolding. Igorance is very creative and intelligent. If there's a way to fuck something up, ignorance will find it.

<p>
	It just never ceases to amaze me.

</p>

<p>
	The trick is to realize that your POV isn't important. After the self is gone there is no problem. The problem of death only feels real until death happens. After the self dies nothing bad can happen to you, because there is no you. You realize you were just an idea.
</p>

<p>
	Santa Claus cannot die because he is a fiction to begin with. But if Santa Claus believed he was real, the discovery that he is a fiction would feel like actual death to him. But all that ever dies is the fiction.

<p>
	Traffic gets pretty bad too because their highways are too narrow.

<title>Political systems in spiral dynamics stages</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Political ideologies are a reflection of one's values.
</p>

<p>
	Do not assume that everyone values fairness, equality, democracy, justice, truth, goodness, love, etc. These are very high values which very few people can live up to or even care about.
</p>

<p>
	The lower your stage of development & consciousness the less you care about those things, the more you care about only your own survival and your tribe's survival.
</p>

<p>
	All political systems reflect this.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you truly valued equality, you would have serious problems with capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	Just look at the values of each stage and then ask yourself, What political system would best reflect these values? And there you have it. The system we got perfectly reflects our real (not ideal) values.
</p>

<p>
	What confuses a lot of people is the ideals that political systems put forth, which are actually bullshit. Every political system tries to make itself out to be greater, more noble than it really is. Which is why you must look at the actions of the system, not its words. Then you see its true values.
</p>

	Take a psychedelic and you will see.
</p>

<p>
	It's being. Total presence for its own sake.
</p>

<p>
	The practical things are: all legit spiritual practices. Spirituality is the art of transcending self-survival.

</p>

<p>
	What are you really talking about when you say those words? Anything real? Anything actual? Or illusions in the mind?
</p>

<p>
	Try to point to one ACTUAL good thing.
</p>

<p>
	Try to point to one ACTUAL evil thing.
</p>

<p>
	Mapping stuff seems cool, but it is conceptual, not ACTUAL, and will likely lead you into self-deception. EVERY concept must be grounded in ACTUALITY if you wish to get closer to truth. It's way too easy for the mind to make shit up. So watch out.

<p>
	When done in a rigid Blue ecosystem like a monastery, mediation can keep you Blue.
</p>

<p>
	In practice Zen monks evolve to Turquoise on the spiritual/metaphysical line but remain underdeveloped on the other lines because meditation alone will not develop all lines.

<p>

<p>
	Of course science has shown centuries ago that all is interconnected, even long before quantum mechanics.
</p>

<p>
	The issue is that it does not fit the modern atheist paradigm, so it is all conveniently forgotten about.

<p>
	Newton was a deist.

	Vegas is actually a great city to live. All the comforts of big cities without the traffic or pollution. Super affordable and nice weather except for theÂ extreme summers.

<p>
	As with anything really, the value lies in the enjoyment of it.
</p>

<p>
	If you enjoy relationships, then do them for that reason.
</p>

<p>
	If you prefer to be a loner, enjoy being a loner.
</p>

<p>
	Life can be a lot richer with good relationships.
</p>

<p>
	Is it possible to engineer your life such that you hardly need any relationships at all? Of course. That's basically what I've done. But now I crave relationships just for the enrichment aspect of them. Not because I need people to do stuff for me. Transactional relationships aren't really much of a relationship at all.

Like I said in the video, government and society is by definition full of socialistic elements. We live in a society where certain things are best done collectively.
</p>

<p>
	Most people don't like to think of roads, national parks, the post service, firefighters, food stamps, or the military as socialism. But they are.
</p>

<p>
	It's really just a matter of degree, not kind. The question is, what kind of things should be socialized and which shouldn't? That is obviously up for debate and empirical testing.
</p>

<p>
	There are no simplistic ideological solutions to governance. Each issue has to be considered on a case by case basis.

I'm well aware of those various distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, even the Nordic countries may not go far enough if you want to totally level the playing field.
</p>

<p>
	It's a nuanced issue which requires careful fine-tuning.
</p>

<p>
	I am talking here more about what things will look like in 100 or 200 years, not necessarily what we should adopt today. In the long run, society will get more and more socialist in ways that most people today would balk at. But that will take time. It's not something Bernie is gonna just push through. It would require a rewiring of the entire culture.

<p>
	The rich & powerful rig the game to make it easier for them to acquire more wealth & power. This has been the case since the dawn of mankind. This is just ego 101.
</p>

<p>
	Providing genuine value is important if you want to create self-made wealth. But since this is challenging and slow, many wealthy & powerful people instead just rig the game and exploit the system. This allows for accumulation of vast amounts of wealth without providing much value. If the system was designed better, many such loopholes would be closed.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a more balanced system then you want a more socialistic, a more directly democratic form of government.

			-Universality. I see an action as good if it would benefit the world for everyone to do it. Put simply, act in a way that does not hinder other people while benefiting you, or the golden rule "treat others as you would be treated" (not exactly the same as universality, but close.Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			-Non initiation of force. Coupled with universality, I think any forceful interaction (done by a human) is wrong. Including taxation, including arresting people for drug possession, hate speech etc. and including hitting your children / significant other because they got on your nerves.Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			-Voluntarism. People can do what ever they want, voluntarily. I have no problem with communist societies existing as long as every member chose to join it, what im not okay with is mandatory rules being forced on people. Of course if you break a rule people can voluntarily choose to not interact with you or help you, thats fine, and if you hurt someone they can defend themselves from you.Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			Philisophically I happiness is basically the ultimate goal of all people. It's hard wired into us, and I don't even think this point is debatable because I would define happiness as "the positive feeling which all other actions are aimed at." I'mÂ <em>not</em>Â into hedonism. Just because happiness is the ultimate goal, doesn't mean you should blindly and stupidly pursue it right now at the cost of others. Moral principles should be followed with disciplineÂ to guide us to long term, sustainable happiness that doesn't rely on harming others. Im serious about my beliefs, I'm fully vegan. I try to always tell the truth, and im successful with that, and I genuinely try to be a good and selfless person.Â

<p>
	All of this is relative and contingent. That's YOUR point of view. Don't expect others to agree with that, and don't expect that to be some eternal, objective truth.
</p>

<p>
	Right and wrong are constructs of your ego-mind. If you stop thinking a thing is wrong, it will stop being wrong.
</p>

<p>
	People will use force regardless of what you believe is right or wrong. People do whatever they want, period. That is always the case. You are free to do whatever you are physically capable of doing.
</p>

<p>
	All shoulds are delusion. There are no shoulds in the universe. Whatever is the case, is what is.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate goal for most people is not happiness but survival. Which is why most people are not happy.
</p>

<p>
	Your beliefs are mostly dualistic. The opposite of nonduality. It would be wise to question and deconstruct them.
</p>

	Consciousness is like an infinite field. Within this infinite field various forms arise. The brain is one of those forms. The forms arise and pass away but the field is never created or destroyed.
</p>

<p>
	Think of a video game. The player character's brain does not create the video game simulation. It is part of the simulation.

	No, the problem is they oversimplify spirituality and try to teach it to people who clearly aren't qualified. Their teachings lack depth and breadth.

Every bit contains every other bit in a strange loopy way. It's possible to become directly conscious of this.

<p>
	Anger is definitely something your mind is actively doing. And you can learn to become conscious enough that it stops happening.
</p>

<p>
	Anger is a self-manipulation. It's a survival mechanism of the ego. Ego uses anger to get its needs met. But there are much healthier, more conscious ways to meet those same needs. In the same way that as an adult you don't need to yell and scream to get your food needs met -- the way you did as a child.

And they idealized the shit out of their culture. They of course were probably at Blue and above. But they were the high elites. The average folks were far less conscious and the culture of the elites is not the same as mainstream vulgar culture. While Virgil was writing his poetry thousands of illiterate Roman peasants were rioting in the streets for bread and sacrificing goats & chickens to minor religious deities (stage Purple). And bloodthirsty mafia-style gangs controlled the various sections of the city. Clan and family warfare was common.
</p>

<p>
	Conventional European history does a poor job of teaching the everyday realities of life in ancient Rome. It's highly idealized and sanitized. Also because it's much harder to find historic evidence of vulgar life. The art that survives is high art of the elites. Poems are not written about bread riots, plague, illiteracy, slavery, gang rape, genocide, torture, and cults.

	Religion is almost always a part of one's ethnicity. Religion does not exist in a vacuum.
</p>

<p>
	If you are religious, your religion was indoctrinated into you as part of your culture and geographic location. If not for that, you would not be religious. You might be spiritual, but not religious. Religion is culture. And their own culture is what ethnocentrists strive to defend.

<p>
	Hippies need a more cerebral integral approach. More book smarts. Learning systems thinking would help them. And studying Spiral Dynamics would help them a lot.
</p>

<p>
	Also, laying off the weed might help them <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />

</blockquote>

<p>
	A nonlinear, hyper-intuitive sort of rationality which is more right-brain dominant vs left-brain dominant, and which focuses on holistic big picture thinking rather than technical analysis or linear logical proofs.
</p>

<p>
	Vision-logic fuses rationality with intuition, consciousness, and high emotional intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Albert Einstein is a great example of vision-logic. He was not the typical cold-hearted, paint-by-numbers academic. Also, Richard Feynman is a good example.
</p>

<p>
	Vision-logic is more playful, whimsical, creative, than traditional logic and very importantly it can handle paradox, which traditional logic cannot.
</p>

<p>
	Douglas Hofstadter is a good example of vision-logic.
</p>

On the other hand a lot of Roman art was a glorification of Red military conquest, power, and domination.

<p>
	Is the Colosseum Red or Blue?
</p>

<p>
	Is Trajan's Column Red or Blue?

<title>Questions to Assess the Lines of Development (Spiral Dynamics)</title>

<p>
	It takes a lot of research to understand the details of how each of those lines evolves.
</p>

<p>
	Some of the lines are not very well documented.
</p>

<p>
	Although the Metaphysical/Spiritual line is very well documented and I've basically addressed it in my Spiral Dynamics mini-series whenever I talked about religion, spirituality, or mysticism.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Stage Blue is dogmatically religious
	</li>
	<li>
		Stage Orange turns materialistic science & rationality into a religion
	</li>
	<li>
		Stage Green is "spiritual but not religious" -- hippie spirituality
	</li>
	<li>
		Stage Yellow is open to mystical ideas but doesn't have direct mystical insight yet. Sort of a conceptual spirituality.
	</li>
	<li>
		Stage Turquoise is having lots of mystical experiences and very aware of the oneness of everything
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You realize that 40% of Romans were slaves?
</p>

<p>
	And that Rome was run by bloodthirsty Emperors many of whom back-stabbed each other?
</p>

<p>
	Ancient Athenes was pretty advanced but it disintegrated rather quickly amidst all of the low consciousness carnage in the area. The tallest blade of grass gets cut the soonest.
</p>

<p>
	The HBO series Rome is a good depiction of life in stage Red. It's actually very similar to the politics of Game Of Thrones. Everyone is scheming to undo everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Rome did have some stage Blue aspects to it. Marcus Aurelius was a fine example of a Blue emperor. Like I said about center of gravity, to say that Rome was Red is to say that 50% of it was Red, 25% Purple, 25% Blue. You see roughly that mix in the HBO Rome show.
</p>

			1. I live in a third world country. I feel miserable with people around me. I mostly think of myself as green person and i get critisized judged and rediculed by people. Many times i feel confused about myself after hearing them. I get emotionally irritated and triggered. It becomes a massive roadblock in my journey of personal development. Do you have any advice for me?
		</p>

		<p>
			2. Assesment about myself in terms of SP gets tricky for me. Sometimes i feel i am overrated and underrated by myself when i try to figure out where i am in terms of sp. What to do with that to reduce my confusion?
		</p>

		<p>
			3. Its not a question, but gratitude for you. You have opened a way through actualized.org for those of us who are questioning literally everything for decades. Thank you dear leo and looking forward to your spiral dynamics application video. And thanks a lot <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />

<p>
	1) That's all grist for the self development mill. The irritation other people cause you shows you which aspects of yourself need more work. They only irritate the ego, not the True Self. This is what I mean when I say life is a love simulator. You are being challenged to love more in the face of criticism and hatred. It requires courage to face and surrender your deepest fears.
</p>

<p>
	2) Keep studying the model more. Read some of the books about it. Then it will be really easy to see where you're at. This model requires at least 20-30 hours of study and contemplation to start to understand. And some reading. It is a big investment, but it will be worth it.
</p>

<p>
	3) My pleasure
</p>

<p>
	1) You can't cure a fool. He has to outgrow his own foolishness. Expect to be judged a lot by lower stages. Maybe even expect that they will kill you one day for your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	2) Higher stages have much less of those things. Life feels better at higher stages. So it's very much worth developing. Compare living in Saudi Arabia vs the US or Northern Europe. Where would you want to live if you were a woman or a minority?
</p>

<p>
	3) Each of you is different. Most of you are Orange/Green probably. But some of you are Yellow/Turquoise.

<title>If fear leads to anger, anger is the fear of what?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Anger is often a smokescreen to mask the true emotion: hurt. The ego hates to admit it is vulnerable, so it likes to act macho when it is hurt by acting angry.
</p>

<p>
	Anger is always about something that happened to you in the past. Hurt exists in the past.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is about worry of something bad happening in the future.
</p>

<p>
	Angry people are usually just hurt people who are in denial about it.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to investigate the hurt. Give yourself the love that others never gave you.
</p>

Pretend like you are trying to fog up a mirror with your breath. But then close your mouth, letting the air go out through the nose.
</p>

<p>
	Experiment with various degrees of constriction of the throat until you get a nice sound going and it feels solid.
</p>

<p>
	Your throat needs to constrict almost as much as possible in order to slow down the air as much as possible, so you can do long slow breaths.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like sucking in air through a straw. But you are using your throat as the straw.

<p>
	How do you make it stick? By doing lots of practices like self-inquiry until your entire reality is deconstructed.

</p>

<p>
	If we didn't call it nonduality what would be call it? How would we let you know this thing exists?

<p>
	Maybe we should call it "chicken" from now on and see if that solves the problem.

<p>
	There is no way to get around the fact that incommunicable things exist. You can try for a million years and you will never solve this problem. Because an unspeakable thing cannot be spoken, by definition.

As he brought up some company banning hugs and later he brought up NBC asking people to report your coworkers if they suspect romantic entanglement.

			You missed the part they cut out where he said "I'm not saying you shouldn't wear make-up". "I'm saying we don't know what the rules are.". Can people be manipulated? What's Vice's reasoning for cutting that out? Literally cut right before he says that.

<p>
	That's just a clever rhetorical trick. He plays this trick a lot. He implies a conservative position but then he never commits to it outright because it would sound ridiculous even to him.
</p>

<p>
	He DID seriously consider the possibilty that women should not wear make up.
</p>

<p>
	He is in the business of playing ideological mind games, not actually offering practical solutions.
</p>

<p>
	He did the same thing with his enforced "enforced monogamy" comment.
</p>

<p>
	JP's whole game is to say deliberately controversial and backwards things, and then dial it back to something half-reasonable. This gets him all of this clicks and views.
</p>

<p>
	The rules are whatever we want them to be. TheyÂ can be very simple: don't slap a woman's ass and be more sensitive to her POV as a man. Don't abuse a position of power to coerce women to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	But this would require admitting that feminism has validity. Which he does not want to do.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	1) Try a psychedelic and you will immediately understand. This is not possible to understand conceptually. You must experience it.
</p>

<p>
	2) Hmmm... that's a bit tricky because all of those things are conceptual. What you can see is how your mind constructs those things. You can see the metaphysical and epistemic substrate of those things.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics certainly make you 100x more creative. But it will not necessarily be productive in the way your ego-mind wants. It will be far more profound than that.
</p>

<p>
	You basically will not care about science and math at this level of depth. They will seemÂ shallow and insignificant compared to metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	During one of my solo retreats I did randomly invent a cool new patentable invention. No psychedelicsÂ were used. Just lots of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become the more creative you become.
</p>

	Nothing even comes close to theÂ strength ofÂ armodafinil other than LSD or the like.
</p>

<p>
	Armodafinil is like a mild psychedelic.

</p>

<p>
	The solution to sexual harassement in the workplace is to forbid women from wearing makeup?
</p>

<p>
	That is what JP is basically saying.
</p>

<p>
	It is simply unworkable and it will not stop sexual harassement.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to workplace harassement is cultural. It requires evolving the workplace culture from Orange to Green. But JP demonizes GreenÂ so he is unable to see the solution. Precisely because his ego does not want a Green culture.
</p>

<p>
	JP's mission in life is to prevent an evolution of cultureÂ into stage Green.
</p>

<p>
	You see the problem with this and why liberals are so opposed to him?
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't mean Green culture is free of problems. But it is surely healthierÂ than Orange culture. And it would reduce sexual harassment.
</p>

<p>
	The MeToo movement is not a mistake. It is a net positive for society despite a few cases of overcorrection. In the end, after all the dust settles, your daughters will better off. And you will embrace it as the obvious solution.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Culturally, a woman's value is highly contingent on her physical appearance.
</p>

<p>
	This goes way deeper than sexual lust.
</p>

<p>
	If your value was based highly on physical appearance, you would do everything you could to maximize that. Not because you want sex, but because you want to be accepted and valued by your tribe.
</p>

<p>
	A woman who shows up to a job interview without makeup will not be hired. Think about that!
</p>

<p>
	It's really not much different if a man showed up to a job interview without combing his hair, shaving his stubble, and ironing his shirt.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone on TV, men and women, wear makeup for this reason.
</p>

<p>
	Every time I shoot a video I spend about 20 minutes making myself look pretty, so you guys aren't disgusted watching my face. That's showbiz. That doesn't mean I want you to slap my ass or fondle my tits if you see me out in public.

</p>

<p>
	You know, right, that most retail shops will not even allow a woman employee to show up to work without makeup? Because it would turn the customers off.
</p>

<p>
	Make up is a cultural necessity for women.
</p>

<p>
	This is just a rehash of the old "You got raped because you were asking for it" excuse. That's how stage Blue thinks about female empowerment/liberation. It's not the responsibility of the man to control himself. So if harassment happens its the woman's fault for being overly sexual.
</p>

<p>
	This exact logic was used in the 1950's to keep women from wearing shorts & skirts.

<p>
	This ain't science bro. This is an ego-mind using science to convince itself of the validity of its crumbling conservative worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: In Saudi Arabia JP's logic can be used to keep women from driving cars, wearing shorts, or owning bank accounts.
