			Strong display of bias. So you probably grew up without sports.
		</p>

		<p>
			Sport is art. I’m surprised you haven’t realized yet at this stage. Take away the competitiveness and it is pure art and joy. The best athletes put on their greatest display when they lose themselves in the joy of the activity. What’s the difference between that and dedicating ones life to music? Whats the difference between Ronaldinho and Mozart? Only different modes of expression. But maybe you condemn other artists the same way, I don’t know. Just a heads up on the bias.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here’s some pure artistry for you
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can find some artistry in sports. But that's not what the professional sports industry is designed to cater to. It is a business built on tribalism.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, you are free to do sports. I was merely explaining why you won't find a lot of high consciousness people in sports. That is all.
</p>

<p>
	You can turn rapid hot-dog eating into an art and compare it to Mozart. But don't be surprised when you don't find the highest grade of consciousness in your colleagues. And don't be surprised when it wrecks your body and you can't do it any more.
</p>

<p>
	A display of master is a rather Orange level thing. A true master doesn't need to strut around like a cock.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Those ways are some of the fastest, but still takes time.
</p>

<p>
	You can always do the techniques twice or even three times as much per day. But also, be careful what you wish for. Slow and steady is usually better than too much too fast.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga requires patience and steady discipline.

</p>

<p>
	In the end, out of all the potential things there are to do in this world, are you seriously going to devote your whole life to being good a throwing or hitting a ball?
</p>

<p>
	Do you see how shallow that is in the grande scheme of things? Once you see that -- which takes some higher consciousness -- then you're not likely to get seduced by that illusion.
</p>

<p>
	But, of course, you're free to do as you like. I'm just explaining why you're not going to find a lot of highly conscious people in sports. Sports is an industry designed for cavemen, not sages.

<p>
	Vegan diet does not work for all people.
</p>

<p>
	So there is the "need".
</p>

<p>
	Judgment of meat-eating is, in a sense, a worse offense than the meat-eating itself. Because by rejecting meat-eaters you reject yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same problem as judging criminals or terrorists. It seems reasonable and justified, but it rots your mind and soul and keeps you from the highest levels of consciousness and love.
</p>

<p>
	Vegans don't appreciate the spiritual complexities of this issue. They like to think from their own POV, which is ironic considering how they care about the POV of animals. But what about the POV humans?
</p>

<p>
	Yes, most people will need to send out many applications because most jobs are simply not the right fit and you won't know that ahead of time without applying and interviewing.

<title>AMAZING speech by Owen Cook (RSD)</title>

</p>

<p>
	If you can't see the value of the above video, regardless of whether Owen is a rapist or a murderer, then you're missing something.
</p>

<p>
	People are not good or bad. People are morally complex. Often their bad parts are redeemed by their good parts.
</p>

<p>
	Owen is a very complex guy. He has a troubled and criminal past. Which is what will make his final transformation so inspiring if he pulls it off. He knows all this and it fuels him.
</p>

<p>
	No, you can't stop those things through argument. In fact, if you argue about that, you'll likely spur it on.
</p>

<p>
	Try to distinguish between discussion/advice/logic vs argumentation.
</p>

<p>
	Logically explaining the consequences of someone's action to them CAN help them to rethink their behaviors. But not argumentation.

<p>
	It could develop your writing skills.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see how it will get you any closer to the publishing industry, as that's more of a sales/marketing/biz domain.
</p>

<p>
	Being a writer is TOTALLY different from being a publisher.
</p>

<p>
	Decide clearly on what you actually want. Do you want to write amazing books or do you want sell/publish the books of other people?
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be great writer, you will never achieve that merely through a degree. You must be writing non-stop in your own free time. That's how true writing skills are developed. Plan to invest 10,000 hours in writing on your own time for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be a publisher, look into degrees about marketing and biz.
</p>

<p>
	In general, you shouldn't major in a thing unless you can see yourself working many years in that field.
</p>

<p>
	Are you going to be working in math or engineering for at least 10 years? Philosophy? Then don't bother. You don't have time to waste on that shit. Time is too precious.
</p>

<p>
	Find the thing you can work 10 years in at least.

	You can always ask directly: "What would your ideal candidate look like?" Then try to actually fit that.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	If you had the proper skills, resume, interview process, and presentation -- you'd get the job.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it from the employer's POV: as an employer you would NEVER hire a person based on random draw or luck. Why would you play dice with your business? That'd be foolish. You're always looking to hire the best person that is available at a reasonable price. You are screening out people who aren't the best fit.
</p>

<p>
	Employers NEVER pick candidates by throwing around darts. Employers are looking for every specific markers, so getting hired is about knowing those markers and nail them. Each job has different markers, requiring a customized approach.
</p>

<p>
	As with most of the realizations we talk about, it's not a binary. It's not merely a matter of getting it or not. It's a question of how deeply do you get it?
</p>

<p>
	If you ask the average person off the street whether people look at the world through different lenses, he would say, "YES! Of course! Duh!"
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean he has even begun to understand the ramifications of what that means. Does he understand that there is no reality independent of the lens one is looking through? Does he understand that terrorism, rape, and incest are relative lenses? Does he understand that physical reality is a relative lens?
</p>

<p>
	Not unless he's Yellow or above. And even then, he still doesn't understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	Truth cannot be argued or argued with.
</p>

<p>
	The more one argues, the less truth one understands.
</p>

<p>
	Have you noticed that the most argumentative people are the most false?
</p>

<p>
	And the most truthful people are the least argumentative?
</p>

<p>
	Why is that? How do you explain that?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The greatest power is not to demand everyone be squeaky clean but to love everyone despite all their devilry. The bigger the devil, the greater your opportunity to demonstrate your love.
</p>

<p>
	When you require people not to be devils, that's actually coming from lack of total self-acceptance. The devil cannot be avoided, the devil must be accepted as your self.

</p>

<p>
	I doubt there was any awakening here at all.
</p>

<p>
	How is medication gonna awaken you?
</p>

<p>
	Way too much jumping to conclusions here. Such overly generalized statements can be dangerous because none of know what this user is really describing. The user himself might not know.
</p>

<p>
	This work requires precision and clarity. If you are facing a spiritual problem, please describe it extra clearly and carefully so there's no ambiguity and we can give you clear answers.

<p>
	That could be a very convenient defense mechanism for your ego.
</p>

<p>
	Criticism and judgment are red-flags for ignorance and falsehood. When you in possession of Truth, you don't judge or criticize much, you appreciate even ignorant people.

<p>
	What do you mean when you say "spiritual awakening"?
</p>

<p>
	And what does this have to do with meditation, meds, and mental hospitals?
</p>

<p>
	Be careful making such broad general statements. They are easily misunderstood, even by yourself, let alone others.
</p>

<p>
	What is your mental health history prior to meditation?
</p>

<title>Sharing my path: RASA, Depression, Psychedelics, Ashram, Romantic Love</title>

<p>
	Be careful with RASA, shaktipat, and this whole Ramaji gang. They are not deeply Awake and following them too closely will lead to delusions. Not to mention that they harbor dogmas and ignorance against psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you reach "1000", that's still a joke compared to true Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You should not rely on a guru to Awaken you. Ultimately it will not work. Which is not to say you shouldn't experiment and try various techniques. For those of you for whom RASA has helped, great. But just know, there's much more beyond RASA.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Anything is possible. But my thyroid disease was diagnosed over 10 years ago, before I started Actualized.org
</p>

<p>
	So be careful about jumping to conclusions. Such health issues can be very complex and involve many independent variables.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I don't feel that psychedelics affect my thyroid one way or another. But of course you never know how some new chemical might affect your body in unknown ways. That is true of all medication, supplements, and even food.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	That human is you.
</p>

<p>
	Stop being lazy and expecting others to prove your own nature to you.
</p>

<p>
	You are Infinite Consciousness, which means you are capable of Total Omniscience and infinite telepathic ability. But it takes serious work. This isn't for dabblers or naysayers.
</p>

<p>
	Intellectual honesty is good. But it doesn't make you right.
</p>

<p>
	Once you completely deconstruct materialism, telepathy becomes quite a reasonable possibility. QM shows us that two particles can communicate instantly across cosmic spacial distances. That's a tiny clue that Consciousness is not seperated from itself in any fundamental way. Consciousness can know all parts of itself instantly. That's what Absolute means.

</p>

<p>
	But that's easy to say and hard to do, as it requires massive consciousness of all of one's mind's self-deception mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
	You CAN support a system without being ideological about it. But it tends to be quite rare.

I would say take a psychedelic and let is show you some things. That then gives you some idea of what you're working towards.
</p>

<p>
	It's really hard to work towards something when you have no clue what it looks like.
</p>

<p>
	For me the biggest value of psychedelics is that they showed the possibilities of developing one's consciousness which I could not imagine in my wildest dreams otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people meditate and self-inquire, but they have no clue what they're really missing, what the full potential is. And so it's hard for them to be serious about it.

You are still loved and forgiven for your fear. It's all part of the Awakening process.

			I suppose the underlying question I’m mostly asking is how do I know I’m on the right path? How do I know who the right teacher is? And who can I trust ? I can’t trust myself? I can’t trust anyone else? How do I know that looking for truth will not lead me to greater delusion? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is the whole problem in a nutshell. There is no easy answer here. It requires a serious commitment to personal investigation while keeping a very open mind and being willing to change directions and admit mistakes.
</p>

<p>
	In the end you are the TRUTH, so you cannot have anyone else get it for you. But of course many people can assist in your awakening process. Sometimes the assistance will be deeply counter-intuitive: the teachers who mislead you the most might be exactly what you needed to ultimately Awaken.
</p>

<p>
	There are many ways to Awaken. A brutal approach is not necessary unless you feel that's what you need.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I find a loving approach works better for me. You may discover the same. Sometimes the harder you push the less it works. So learning surrender can be crucial.
</p>

<p>
	When in doubt, listen to your heart. Listen to love over fear.
</p>

<p>
	You will never go wrong with Love because Love is Truth. One day you will understand. But probably not for a while.

<p>
	Pursue it, or don't. Up to you.

<title>Three Card Tarot Readings (Non-Psychic)</title>

<p>
	Guys, watch how easily you are willing to surrender your authority and responsibility for self-reflection to someone else.
</p>

<p>
	If you're serious about growing up, ponder whether doing so is a good idea.
</p>

<p>
	No disrespect to Emerald. But this can turn into a disservice for people. You must learn to stand up on your own two feet rather than asking an online stranger what your life purpose should be, etc.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know any of this is correct? Are you willing to stake your life on it?
</p>

<p>
	If you're just doing this to have fun, okay. But some people here look way too eager to have a stranger give them marching orders for life, which is not in the spirit of self-actualization. It is critical that you learn to listen to your heart and trust yourself more than any Tarot card.
</p>

<p>
	God is speaking through your heart. Why the fuck aren't you listening?
</p>

<p>
	No, I had zero intention of leaving. But then I stumbled my way into a level of consciousness so high that it seemed like to go any higher it would be a point of no return. Once you go that high there might be no coming back.

	If you transcend all differences, none of those physical difference would exist. So it would be irrelevant.

	God don't care who it fucks or doesn't fuck.

	There is no difference between a vagina and a roll of toilet paper. Only does the ego-mind imagine a difference.

	Yes, it's a serious problem.

<p>
	I'm not well versed in it. If you want to cure it, buy all the books on it you can and do all the research and then start testing various solutions until something sticks.

<title>Perusing enlightenment at 19?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Pretty much everyone needs those things unless you are going to become a full-time monk.
</p>

<p>
	So it's a question of whether you want to be a householder or a monk. There's no right answer. It's all about what you want.
</p>

<p>
	At an age so young, you've got plenty of time to build up a decent life for yourself (over the next 10 years let's say) and then you can abandon it later if you want to go hardcore monk. Or you can have that householder life established and waiting for you after you return from your spiritual quest.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming a monk at 19 is too extreme for most people. That would only be if you know for sure that your destiny is to be a full-time hardcore Buddha. But it even took The Buddha til 27 to leave his household and till 30-something to reach enlightenment.

</p>

<p>
	Seems hard to deny that.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying you should do it. Just saying it's a possibility.
</p>

<p>
	I would not be talking about it unless I had been thrust into it, and had to seriously evaluate where this is a place I want to go. Not a thing you want to stumble into by accident.

<p>
	The problem with mahasamadhi is that it doesn't really lend itself to documentation. If you're doing it, you will not give a damn about this world. You are basically choosing to destroy the dream world in favor of pure Infinity. So there will be no one to benefit from your documentation. Not to mention it's hard to post a video of yourself killing yourself. YouTube would shut it down.

Only upon death can such things happen by guru's grace because there is a gap of limbo state and you can be dissolved in that moment. Sadhguru talks about it somewhere.

<p>
	I think I reached a point with 5-MeO-DMT in which a mahasamadhi might be possible -- if one really wanted to push for it.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is unproven.
</p>

<p>
	It took me about 80 trips. The mind becomes so indifferent to all differences that it seems to mirror Sadhguru's descriptions of what mahasamadhi requires: a totally equanimus mind which does not differentiate between anything and does not want to differentiate between anything. This is Love in its purest form.

<p>
	Maybe, but that's not what I understand currently. I understand it to be permanent pure Infinity/Love, and that's the end. The dream world is transcended and realized to never have existed.
</p>

<p>
	The way to escape the dream world is to realize that its only function was to teach you that reality is LOVE. Once this is fully recognized, that's it! The function of the dream world has been achieved. It was only a staging ground for the ultimate self-realization. Everything is Absolute Infinity. Period. This level of consciousness gives you complete omniscience. At which point you know yourself so completely that you are done. There cannot be anything more. You are Totally ONE, forever.

<p>
	About Sadhguru, I will say this. After studying him a bit closer, and in light of my recent awakenings, I think he's more awake than I originally thought. I think he's a masterful teacher and yogi.
</p>

<p>
	Given the tricky business of trying to guess another teachers' degree of awakeness, I will refrain from making definitive statements and instead just caution you guys not to take it for granted that your favorite teacher/guru is at the highest level. Be skeptical, but also open-minded and fair -- and acknowledge excellence where you see it.
</p>

<p>
	There is much valuable stuff you can learn from Sadhguru. I would not want to denigrate his work. But also keep in mind that there may be higher levels. How would you know? You see? That's the key point. The trick is to learn from teachers without getting stuck with their limits. Of course this applies to me as well.
</p>

	That would be the point of becoming a Bodhisattva.
</p>

<p>
	It does feel pretty selfish to just leave everyone behind without helping them.
</p>

<p>
	I think most of you guys should stay away from Mahasamadhi. Don't even think about it. It's only a thing the most radical spiritual seekers should consider when they reach that level. Most people just want some basic satori or God-realization and embodiment.

<p>
	That's the thing. Once you become conscious enough, teaching people becomes pointless since they are just you.

<p>
	With Mahasamadhi you stop imagining people who need teaching.

<p>
	By definition Mahasamadhi means your body drops dead at the moment of total realization.
</p>

<p>
	Technically speaking though, your body does not drop dead. Rather, you become so Conscious that you realize that your body and world never even existed. And finally you decide to stop imagining them. And so everything ends. This is DEATH.

	There is only one being who can ever awaken, and that is you. Forget about The Buddha. The Buddha cannot ever awaken because he's an idea in your mind. Only you can Awaken.

			Francis talks about Love and God, and especially about not being a human body. Francis’ level of awakening has been my goal all along, but if you’re saying there’s more, that’s nuts. How is that even possible? What would change? What would Francis have to do (inb4 5-meo.and even then it wouldn’t last?) to reach even further? From all accounts he’s dead inside. How is that not total?! «The goal of the game is to realize you are not in the game» - Francis

	Just to be on the safe side I would assume higher levels are possible. It's not that his teachings are bad or wrong. We don't really disagree. Just a question of degree and various facets.

<p>
	For me it is both. It helps a lot to do the same psychedelic over and over again. And it helps to do various ones at times, so that you get a better contrast and appreciation for their differences. It should all build on itself. At least it did for me.

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			How would that be different to the events that happened to Ramana, Eckhart, Sean Webb, Francis Lucille etc?  
		</p>

		<p>
			Take this excerpt from Francis Lucille for example:
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>I was sitting in silence, meditating in my living room with two friends. It was too early to fix dinner, our next activity. Having nothing to do, expecting nothing, I was available. My mind was free of dynamism, my body relaxed and sensitive, although I could feel some discomfort in my back and in my neck.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>After some time, one of my friends unexpectedly began to chant a traditional incantation in Sanskrit, the Gayatri Mantra. The sacred syllables entered mysteriously in resonance with my silent presence which seemed to become intensely alive. I felt a deep longing in me, but at the same time a resistance was preventing me from living the current situation to the fullest, from responding with all my being to this invitation from the now, and from merging with it. As the attraction toward the beauty heralded by the chant increased, so did the resistance, revealing itself as a growing fear that transformed into an intense terror.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>At this point, I felt that my death was imminent, and that this horrendous event would surely be triggered by any further letting go on my behalf, by any further welcoming of that beauty. I had reached a crucial point in my life. As a result of my spiritual search, the world and its objects had lost their attraction. I didn’t really expect anything substantial from them. I was exclusively in love with the Absolute, and this love gave me the boldness to jump into the great void of death, to die for the sake of that beauty, now so close, that beauty which was calling me beyond the Sanskrit words.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>As a result of this abandon, the intense terror which had been holding me instantaneously released its grip and changed into a flow of bodily sensations and thoughts which rapidly converged toward a single thought, the I-thought, just as the roots and the branches of a tree converge toward its single trunk. In an almost simultaneous apperception, the personal entity with which I was identifying revealed itself in its totality. I saw its superstructure, the thoughts originating from the I-concept and its infrastructure, the traces of my fears and desires at the physical level. Now the entire tree was contemplated by an impersonal eye, and both the superstructure of thoughts and the infrastructure of bodily sensations rapidly vanished, leaving the I-thought alone in the field of consciousness. For a few moments, the pure I-thought seemed to vacillate, just as the flame of an oil lamp running out of fuel, then vanished.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>At that precise moment, the immortal background of Presence revealed itself in all its splendor.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>-</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			So according to you this kind of ‘final’ awakening is just a joke, am I right? Sorry for hacking away at you with this but I have to in order to clarify things for myself.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not a joke. That's pretty good. Sounds like Nirvakalpa samadhi.
</p>

<p>
	To me though, that's still not God-realization and not Love-realization, so not the highest level.
</p>

<p>
	But find out for yourself. I'm just putting questions in your mind.

			Seems too crazy. Samadhi it supposed to show there's no duality. When you "come back" you are just imagining yourself  again to be a human.

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	Life and reality both are imaginary. To become fully conscious is to exit the game of life entirely into eternal Love. Not for the faint of heart.

<p>
	I don't consider Ken Wilber Awake. Hard to explain why I know that.
</p>

<p>
	If you read Ken's memoirs, seems like he still suffers and deals with a lot of human BS.
</p>

<p>
	Part of the trick is how you define "suffering". People like to use different definitions.

<p>
	20, 40, 60, 100 trips, each one taking you deeper. Of course, these trips must be carefully spaced out so you have time to integrate the insights. Might take years.
</p>

<p>
	After 100 trips now, my depth of consciousness has become so profound that I fear if I take any more, I will simply leave my body into Infinity. It is nothing like what it was when I first began.

<p>
	Many ways brother. All the classical spiritual techniques are designed to aid in this.
</p>

<p>
	I have found 5-MeO-DMT to be the fastest and most effective. Your results may vary. Other psychedelics are also great. Use whatever is accessible.

<p>
	Or start a serious meditation or yoga practice.

<p>
	Awakening is Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is your destiny. Nothing occurs which isn't Love. Awakening is simply consciousness of that.
</p>

<p>
	When you see everything as Perfect, when you have surrendered completely to indiscriminate Love, what need is there to control things? Love flows. The only thing stopping it is fear. Fear of losing yourself. The more you lose yourself, the more Love just flows without manipulation or planning.
</p>

<p>
	If you were fully Awake you wouldn't want anything but the highest expression of Love. Which is precisely what you as God are always creating.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is Love. The end. Keep digging until you get it.
</p>

	Integrate and gently keep going deeper. Ketamine might not be the best for helping you realize what God is. But these were legit and important insights.

			So where does transcending suffering fit into the picture? If you can't handle any amount of pain thrown at you, doesn't this mean we are still being restricted by egoic mechanisms? We are still resisting what is?

</blockquote>

<p>
	The only way to reach the kind of thing you say, "Where any amount of pain can be thrown at you" is reach Infinite Consciousness and do a mahasamadhi. If you do this, the entire Universe will disappear, along with your body, into Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	No one alive has done this. But it is possible to do. This is more radical than shooting your children in the head. And no one here has the balls or understanding to do it.
</p>

<p>
	But if you managed to pull it off, you'd be Infinite Love forever.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of men is exactly the opposite: Love!
</p>

<p>
	Although Love is impossible to learn wothout deep suffering. So it goes full-circle.

<p>
	May Elliot find the Love he's lost.

<p>
	It's more a mix of psychedelic + dissociative. Not a deliriant and not poisonous as far as I know.

			Do you think at a higher state of awakening you would use salvia again? Don't you think the ego is just scared of having its reality torn away and projects fear unto the salvia? How come someone like Martin Ball was able to use it often at breakthrough doses and enjoy/benefit from it?
		</p>

		<p>
			Does that show that the problem is with your ego and not with Salvia? Don't you think you could be missing out on a valuable tool? Maybe you just weren't ready for what that realm of consciousness had to show you!

	An elimination diet can be a great way to isolate which foods are causing you problems. It doesn't mean you have to only eat meat forever.
