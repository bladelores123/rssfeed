<title>View on depersonalization from a higher level of awareness. (psychedelics question)</title>

<p>
	I think I got a feel for depersonilzation a bit on salvia.
</p>

<p>
	It can feel hollow, bleak, or joyless.
</p>

<p>
	What people don't understand is that there is no such thing as "enlightenment" per se. There are an infinite number of different states of consciousness, some of which are more awake than others. "Enlightenment" can manifest itself in thousands of different states which could be considered "awake". Each teacher has a slightly different state of it. Depresonalization is one of those states. Love is another. And so on.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make is thinking that enlightenment is a single state for everyone. It is not. And you cannot avoid states. You are always in some kind of state regradless of how enlightened you are.
</p>

	That's the ultimate realization.

	Your bad first trip was simply due to fear and resistance. You had to face that fear and surrender in order to break through to Love.

<p>
	No idea about that.
</p>

<p>
	I have little interest in the occult because God-realization is so much cooler.
</p>

<p>
	I would assume the doorway to God is always there for you to open regardless of what you did in the past. It's just that "black magic" will be a distraction from opening that door.

<p>
	Seems to me like depersonalization might be a function of your default brain chemisty. Some brains may just be more skewed towards dissociated states, like how some brains are more logical and others more emotional.

<p>
	Exploring the occult is not awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Most occult people are nowhere near awake.
</p>

<p>
	You can explore it, just don't fool yourself that it is awakening.

		</p>

		<p>
			I don't think I've ever been at 1000 so it would be hard to say what is beyond that. But from what I have read:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				“I” As the Ultimate Reality beyond this dimension transcending dimensions - 1,100
			</li>
			<li>
				“I” As Essence of Creation - 1,200
			</li>
			<li>
				Archangel - 50,000+
			</li>
			<li>
				Divinity - Infinite
			</li>
		</ul>

			Personally I'm feeling kinda lost at the moment. I'm concentrating really hard to see what I'm not seeing, but I'm not getting anywhere. You are talking about God all the time but wtf is that. I just don't get it. Or maybe I do, but I'm fooling myself to believe otherwise.

<p>
	Well, I consider that Ramaji got inspired by David Hawkin's scale but they are not the same scale. I would not treat them as interchangeable.
</p>

<p>
	Scales are relative things and you can always invent whatever scale you want. Nothing wrong with that.
</p>

<p>
	But also, I would not agree to try to define awakening on a one dimensional scale of any size. That's far too limited. Awakening is multi-dimensional and endless. So I could never agree to place it on a scale of 0 to 1000. But even so, Ramaji's scale could still be useful. I just would caution that all such maps and models are limited and shouldn't be taken as absolute.

<p>
	There's nothing wrong with Ramaji per se. If his work helps you, by all means use it. Just don't be limited by any one teacher or teaching.

<p>
	No.
</p>

<p>
	I experience it as Infinite Consciousness and God, but in a gnarly different way than on any other psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, I have only done a little salvia. I'm scared to do more.
</p>

<p>
	You want to be careful with such things. Don't take more than you can handle.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, on salvia, you will easily forget you ever had a life. This is a freaky experience.

<p>
	All I can suggest if you're stuck in depersonalization is to work towards breaking through to the Love aspect of reality, which you're sorely missing.
</p>

<p>
	And this is why depersonalization is fundamentally false and not awakening. It's missing the Love which true awakening reveals.
</p>

<p>
	What you're really looking for is an awakening of the heart, not this dissociative emptiness shit.
</p>

<p>
	TSH of 2.6 is not that high though. That's within normal range. With real hypothyroidism your TSH might be 20 or higher.
</p>

<p>
	You should track your Free T3 and Free T4. That's what matters most.
</p>

<p>
	But thanks for sharing.

</blockquote>

<p>
	A much smaller extent than most alt-rigthers and progressives believe.
</p>

<p>
	Propaganda is a very sneaky and subtle force. It is not done consciously in most cases. It is unconscious. For propaganda to be most effective the people who manufacture it have to convince themselves that it isn't propaganda. They have to be true believers.
</p>

<p>
	CNN and MSNBC does not manufacture propaganda. They are simply an echo-chamber for mainstream American culture. Which is the propaganda/establishment. Everybody on these networks believes they are being objective, accurate, and truthful. Progressives make a huge mistake when they think that mainstream media is deliberately lying. That's a progressive projection which arises out of not understanding that people can hold different worldviews, and all worldviews are relatively valid.
</p>

<p>
	The progressive worldview is not "truth", as progressives assume. It is a relative fabrication. But of course, to understand this means transcending stage Green.

<p>
	Just keep in mind fasting can seriously hinder your ability to do everyday functions.
</p>

<p>
	The deeper your fast, the less you do. This can be a positive or a negative depending on your goals.
</p>

<p>
	There is probably be periods where you feel really weak and shitty.

	Unfortunately sticking your head in the sand about infinite consciousness does not make you infinitely conscious. You are settling for something less.

<p>
	I think this is the norm.
</p>

<p>
	Evolved leaders are rare and they often go unappreciated, kicked out, jailed, or killed.
</p>

<p>
	Devils will not follow an angel. Devils want to follow one of their own. This is fundamentally why great selfless leadership is rare. Selfish people cannot handle a selfless leader. To a selfish person a selfless person looks like a devil. Because a devil preceives selflessness as evil. Because a devil sees falsehood as truth and truth as falsehood, good as evil and evil as good.

			But...  if the leadership of those media companies are orange and their prime motive is to maximize profit, wouldn't they also see Bernie /progressives as a threat to their profit and their "Billionaire Friends" and thus have a bias against him for that reason as well. Why wouldn't they want to use their power to deliberately paint him and his values in a negative light?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course they do! 
</p>

<p>
	That's what I mean by their bias.
</p>

<p>
	What must be understood is that this is a function of culture. CNN operates within a culture. American culture as a whole defines the playing field for large business. A large business can only survive and thrive if it serves the larger mainstream culture, which is stage Orange. To achieve this, CNN must hire Orange employees, anchors, and managers. So CNN is fully enmeshed in the larger matrix of American culture. In this sense CNN has an establishment stage Orange bias. Not because they want to manufacture propaganda but because they are children of the larger culture and so they end up reinforcing it unwittingly. They paint Bernie as negative because he is too different to what they are used to, and they don't have a good sense of vision into the next level of where culture is headed. It is not in their financial interest to have a progressive vision.
</p>

<p>
	When we are talking about Sanders winning, we are really talking about changing culture, which is very hard to do because culture has homeostasis. Culture resists change. So of course mainstream media will not be embracing Bernie with hugs and kisses. They will look at him skeptically and dismissively. Why would a successful CNN anchor who lives a good life and works his ass off to build his career risk rocking the boat? He reinforces the culture which allowed him to be successful. This is just survival 101. You might as well be asking him to put a gun to his head.
</p>

<p>
	But Sander's job is to bust through all that resistance. That's why evolution is hard and slow. It's not because of evil eiltes per se. The evil elites are just children of the deeper problem, which is the culture.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that anything is a valuable experience after the fact. But some experiences can be traumatic.
</p>

<p>
	I would be extremely cautious with salvia. It can traumatize you. You have no idea how radically it will mindfuck you. We are talking madness territory.
</p>

<p>
	You will enjoy other psychedelics far more. Why traumatize yourself? Take some LSD and enjoy yourself.

<title>Why judgement or discernment of consciousness in others is deceptive</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	No, the issue goes far deeper than mere judgment.
</p>

<p>
	It's a valid question as to who is more awake than whom. Some people are just not as awake as others. This is just the case.
</p>

<p>
	But the problem is, how can you really be sure what another is conscious of? It's hard to tell because you are evaluating that from your own level of consciousness, which will have some ceiling. If the other person is more awake than you, you will not be able to know that until you reach his level or higher.
</p>

<p>
	And of course when you awaken deeply enough you will realize you are the only awakened being in the universe, since every other enlightened master is just a projection of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	When you awaken deep enough, the entire universe awakens with you.
</p>

<p>
	Personality and charisma matter.
</p>

<p>
	McCain was this crusty old crippled white guy who moved like a robot. He was like your weird grandpa.
</p>

<p>
	Obama was charismatic, youthful, hopeful, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This kinda shallow stuff matter. It's first impressions.
</p>

<p>
	And also Obama was helped by 8 years of Bush's buffoonery. I think people just got sick of Bush and his neo-con admin. People badly wanted something new.
</p>

<p>
	If you give people too much Blue/Orange they end up disgusted by it. They start craving some change, some Green.
</p>

<p>
	Same might happen after 8 years of Trump buffoonery. People will be so sick of it. Or maybe they are already sick enough after 4 years. Hopefully.

	I haven't noticed any degradation in quality if it's kept in a dry, dark place.
</p>

<p>
	You can vacuum seal it if you want very long term storage. Although it will keep for years even without that. Chemicals are generally very stable. Active peyote has been found in thousand year old tombs.

<p>
	I would not partition 1g into 100mg bags. 1g is not a lot to begin with. You will lose material on each plastic bag as it clings.

<p>
	Bottom line is: it changes your state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Your current state of consciousness is totally inadequate for spiritual understanding.
</p>

<p>
	You need some way to change your state, whether that be psychedelics, concentration, fasting, breathing, whatever.

<p>
	Yes, I pointed this out in my latest blog video.

<p>
	Except there is a difference. America and Russian are in different developmental positions. And Trump is a moron who is making America weaker. For Russians, Putin is a pretty decent president. For Americans, Trump is a shitty president. We can do much better.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a limited partial truth.
</p>

<p>
	There are deep problems with the Marxist framing of elites vs working class. This is a dualistic frame and it will not hold up to deep scrutiny and it will cause problems when mistaken for reality.
</p>

<p>
	The boundary between elites and working class is much more fluid. There is really no such thing as "an elite" or "a capitalist" or "a boss". These are gross oversimplifications.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that your "boss" is your enemy is a problematic framing. Your boss is also often your boss because he knows a lot better than you want to do to make the company not die. The boss has a lot more responsibility than the average worker. He has to work night and day to make sure the business doesn't collapse. This requires a lot of intelligence and strategy, and taking on risk.
</p>

<p>
	So simply blaming the bosses is not going to cut it.
</p>

<p>
	But of course bosses can be exploitative too. It's a very complex dynamic.
</p>

<p>
	Russia has evolved enormously and is in its best shape ever.
</p>

<p>
	You take for granted how terribly underdeveloped Russia was 100 years ago, or even 30 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	The living conditions for Russians have improved significantly since the early 1990s under Putin's leadership. Russia is now once again becoming a player on the world stage. You have to see this from Russia's POV, not yours.
</p>

<p>
	Putin is looking out for Russia's survival. Which is exactly what most Russians want. They want more world power and wealth. They don't want to be bullied by Americans.

<p>
	No it isn't. That's stage Red.
</p>

<p>
	Serious business leaders are not con-artists. They're actually good at creating value and results and getting shit done. They run successful companies which build real things. Trump is incapable of that. He's too selfish and ignorant for that. He's only capable of bullshitting his way through life.
</p>

<p>
	Putin is a very competent manager and mastermind administrator.

<title>Is emotional release necessary on this path?</title>

<p>
	Very necessary if you want to be fully whole and not dysfunctional.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that many of those Buddhist monks are dysfunctional people regardless of how enlightened they are.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening requires a lot of processing of your internal emotional baggage. The more baggage you have, the more you'll have to process to reach ultimate peace.
</p>

<p>
	Working out your emotional baggage is one of the most useful things you can do in life.
</p>

<p>
	It is a mistake to suppress emotional and psychological stuff by deciding to just bull your way through to enlightenment. You can bull your way through to enlightenment (maybe), but you will have a lot of inner work to do afterwards. The macho Zen approach is not that effective for most people. Most people need a softer, more emotional, more holistic approach.

</p>

<p>
	And so we end up in the mess we are in.
</p>

<p>
	And the way to get out of this mess is to start to unravel all the selfishness and self-bias and understanding others agendas as if they were your own.

<p>
	Trump is a moron, Putin is a grandmaster strategist.
</p>

<p>
	Also, Putin is not as bad as Trump because Russia is in a very different stage of development. Russia is so corrupt that it requires an authoritarian to keep things steady. Putin is problematic from America's POV but honestly Putin is doing what Russia needs to regain its power on the world stage and defend Russians from exploitation by Americans and their allies.
</p>

<p>
	Putin is a strongman because that's what is required to rule Russia at this point.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful judging Putin when you have no idea how hard it is to rule in Russia. Russia ain't the US or Northern Europe.

<p>
	I have my disagreements with Ralston. He's way too dismissive of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics absolutely, 100% increase consciousness.  I don't know how anyone can deny this.

<p>
	JP teaches people to take responsibility for their lives -- "Clean your room. Get your house in order before you go and try to fix the world." -- but then he himself goes and tries to fix the world without having put his (spiritual) house in order.
</p>

<p>
	"Get your house in order" is great advice. But this advice goes much deeper than JP yet realizes. There are many, many degrees of getting one's house in order.

<p>
	Yes, you are unwittingly rejecting and demonizing your own self because your consciousness is not yet high enough to realize that JP is you.

	Of course. Self-deception applies to everyone.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	You may be conscious enough to see that JP shows physical signs of neurosis, but that doesn't mean he is conscious of that. Don't forget, it's very easy to see the self-deceptions of others but much harder to see one's own. So while you can easily see JP's self-deceptions, he can't see them so easily.
</p>

<p>
	Deep down JP believes the things he says are not just true, but so true as to be highly important to communicate to mankind. What he says is relatively true from his POV. From your POV you can see obvious limitations of his worldview. And from my POV I see the obvious limitations of your worldview.
</p>

<p>
	A) I don't think that JP is being deliberately dishonest or manipulative. He's a true-believer in his ways of seeing the world. He's not dishonest, he's just stuck in self-deception and doesn't see a clear way out. This is a rather sad state of affairs which should spark some compassion in you.
</p>

<p>
	I actually find JP quite honest. It's one of his better qualities. He's honest about his limitations and doubts where most people wouldn't be. Of course being honest does not automatically solve the problem of self-deception. There are many things he's simply not conscious of.
</p>

<p>
	B) Even if he was dishonest and manipulative as you project he is -- even if he was the biggest devil on the planet -- he is still you. So you're still judging and hating yourself. Yes, millions of people can be misled. And your job is accept, forgive, understand, and love that because that is Truth/Reality/God/You.
</p>

<p>
	You can't hate JP for being JP any more than you can hate a kangaroo for being a kangaroo. What else would it be?
</p>

	The blind love to follow the blind.
</p>

<p>
	But don't forget, Jordan Peterson is you. So have compassion for his ignorance and confusion. It is also your ignorance and confusion.

<p>
	The best way to see JP is as a lost and abused little boy in need of a hug from you. Railing against JP is like shooting fish in a barrel and it only exacerbates the problem.

	Well, considering he invented his scale, it would be silly to say he's not 1000 since he's using himself to calibrate the scale. So it's true by definition.

<p>
	Yes, the body is appearing in you. But this appearance is a certain state of consciousness with certain limitations. You experience being a human but not a kangaroo, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the world is an expression of infinite love, and yet there are deeper levels of infinite love in which there is no world at all because the world is still too limited for the highest levels of infinite love.

<p>
	The human dream is fundamentally limiting.

<p>
	It's pretty weak to just quit so early. Biden still has a decent chance. Trump may simply be in a very bad position economically by November. A lot will happen by November. I'd say the odds right now are 50/50. A lot of people are simply sick of Trump and to them Biden will look like a reasonable, sane, safe way out of Trump's disgrace.
</p>

<p>
	To give up now just because Biden doesn't give you a hard-on is silly.

As you said in your last video, going away for deepening and explore healing, this "letting" of consciousness is absolutely true. But I do wonder, if one could ever so possible evolve beyond shaktipat. The idea is there, so I would say so. I don`t want to stop, ever.

	From my personal experience, there are levels of awakening way beyond 1000. But don't expect Ramaji to admit that. You can't know it until you've been there.

<p>
	Even that is tricky because people understand love in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	But I generally agree that Love is a very distinctive level of awakening which many lack.
</p>

<p>
	It's also possible they don't talk about it so that you can discover it on your own because love can be a very misleading notion for the ego-mind. Talking about love makes people think love is a personal feeling or something like that.

	What more do you want?

<p>
	If there are bodies or vehicles, there is no fucking way any military government will give those up for public display in some museum. This would be the most valuable technology on the planet and the first priority would be to use it to gain advantage over other governments. All that will surely be kept top level classified.
</p>

<p>
	It's also reasonable that advanced aliens would not likely crashland on Earth. They probably know how to fly real well.
</p>

<p>
	It makes a lot of sense to me that aliens would fly around and observe us from a distance without meddling in our politics because that is a lost cause.

<p>
	There is a point in becoming more conscious as it improves life.
</p>

<p>
	Also, just because death happens to the body does not automatically mean you stay in Infinite Love forever. You may still not be ready for that and reincarnate as a Nazi or something.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Love is the ulitmate destination, but how long it takes you to get there is up to you. Maybe you'll need 100 lifetimes.

	Or maybe it will lead to riots and WW3 as all the conservatives, atheists, and religious fantatics lose their shit.
</p>

<p>
	People are too ignorant to even do one month of stay at home.
</p>

<p>
	What if this alien has bacteria and viruses? The US government would arrest him and probably kill him to see his innards. How stupid would the alien have to be to travel a thousand light years just to land on the White House lawn and have to deal with Trump and his alt-right asshats?

<p>
	I have tried but it doesn't work well with my health conditions. It makes them worse.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not sure how it works for healthy people.

<title>the illusion of utopia equality or end of hierarchy</title>

<p>
	What I have seen is this:
</p>

<p>
	When your consciousness goes fully infinite, even the notion of eating cake or experiencing life becomes extraneous. If you were infinitely conscious you would be so complete and full, so not lacking in anything, that life itself would become obsolete and come to an end. You would simply exist as pure Infinite Love forever.
</p>

<p>
	If you are still here eating cake, you're not complete. Your love is indirect.
</p>

<p>
	Just to experience life is already an act of seperation and bias. And with it must come lack, because your highest form is pure formless Love. Until you are an absolute Unity, you are lacking something. When you are an absolute Unity, there is need for celebration or enjoyment of even life. You are too united for such games. They are all indirect. Life itself is indirect.
</p>

<p>
	Life is for kids who are too scared of Infinite Love forever.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is speculating about the levels of consciousnes of people you don't really know.
</p>

<p>
	The correct answer is: you are just guessing. And that's a dangerous game to play as you could easily be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	So be careful. You could really get screwed up that way by assuming too much. You are not in a good position to judge anyone's level of realization until you yourself are deeply realized. And even then it's tricky.
</p>

<title>Inevitable Fatality vs.Illusory Free Will</title>

<p>
	Reality is nondual, so you cannot put it into simplistic human cateogries like free will vs no free will.
</p>

<p>
	There really is no difference between the two.
</p>

<p>
	Since you are God, you are in the very nexus of creation, where Will and Being merge into a seamless Unity. You are in the driver's seat, driving creation.
</p>

<p>
	Reality/God is a tautology, which means it cannot be any other way than the way it is. But it is always in the process of creation, so it will become whatever you create. Your destiny is whatever you end up creating in the now. What is meant to be is whatever you create.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you regret, the ultimate lesson is to forgive yourself and love yourself. There are probably other lessons there as well, but the highest lesson is to accept reality as it is, which in this case includes whatever bad act you committed. You can learn to do it better next time, but the fact is whatever mistakes you made in the past are whatever they are, and could not be otherwise. So accept it. But the future is open and unknown, so you are not doomed to repeat the same mistakes. You get to decide how things will unfold.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to be confused about the lesson. It might take months or years before you learn what the lesson was. The lesson may still be unfolding so maybe you don't have enough data yet to draw a solid conclusion.
</p>
