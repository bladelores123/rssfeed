<p>
	The best way to stay safe is to measure your doses carefully and keep them low to moderate. Do not do high doses.
</p>

<p>
	Risk increases exponentially with dose. 2x the dose, 4x the risk. 4x the dose, 16x the risk.

<p>
	I like being a higher achiever. And I often worked more than 40 hrs per week. But it has to be carefully balanced out against the higher things in life. It shouldn't become a lifestyle nor its own end. You can do it for short bursts when something important needs to be completed.

<p>
	Yes, that's how it looks, and all the DMT vapor crystallizes on all that glass and you lose 50% of your dose on the glass. Then you gotta chase it down the pipe with the torch like an idiot and it ends up burning too.
</p>

<p>
	DMT vapor will crystallize instantly on anything cool it touches.

<p>
	Absurd logic which assumes that such things scale linearly. They don't. Many studies have been done and show that productivity does not continue to scale after 40+ hours/wk. In fact, you start making costly mistakes and then burn out.
</p>

<p>
	This is a good example of how dumb and illogical stage Orange logic can be.
</p>

<p>
	Not to even mention that high achievement is a pointless goal because it does not produce happiness, consciousness, truth, or love -- which are the real goal.
</p>

<p>
	Landing a man on Mars will not make Elon Musk any happier. Nor will it make mankind any happier. It's a rather shallow flex goal. It's just a sci-fi version of the rat-race designed to appeal to nerds who are so spiritually bankrupt they know nothing better.

Purely. No crazy, wacky, psychedelic-y visuals.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	God is everything, so crazy, wacky, psychedelic-y visuals are not excluded and in no way interfere or contradict becoming God. God is that.
</p>

<p>
	God is there with visuals or without. God is never not present. Every visual is it, but it is not limited to any visual.
</p>

<p>
	Don't poo-poo the visuals. The visuals can be a very profound and effective mode of communication and comprehension. Although never strictly necessary. It's icing on the nondual cake.
</p>

<p>
	Do not make the mistake of thinking that nonduality or awakening requires no visuals.
</p>

<p>
	A TV is a TV regardless of what it displays, or even whether it displays anything at all. But you are making the simple mistake of thinking that you cannot be conscious of the TV while it is displaying a movie. Of course you can. In fact, that's the point: to be conscious that the movie is the TV while it is playing. Otherwise you're lost in the illusion.
</p>

<p>
	So rather than rejecting visuals, embrace them and see right through them without getting hypnotized by them.
</p>

<p>
	This work is not about speculation or guesswork, it's about becoming exactly conscious of what is true.
</p>

<p>
	What are you? What is reality? What is another? What is consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	These are not questions to speculate about. Become directly conscious of what these things are until no more doubt or questions remain.
</p>

<p>
	If you are speculating about solipsism then you are clearly not conscious of what "other" is. Nor are you conscious of what "self" is.
</p>

<p>
	Stop presuming stuff and become conscious of Infinity.
</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			You know that all language, thinking and statements are only partly true, and cannot directly "be" absolutes. When you say things like in this thread, what is the motive behind it? By which standards do you choose what way you express your own experience? Are you trying to form your statements to be as "useful" as possible, even when you know they cannot capture actual "truth"?

<p>
	You have to factor in the relativity of language into anything being said.

			So.. "ego" doesn't exist, not even as a thought, right? it's a total illusion, there's nothing at all to which you could point and say "there is the ego".
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Ego is more than a thought, since thoughts come and go all the time, but your sense of self is pretty constant and much more stable than any one thought or belief.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is actually a state of consciousness. Consciousness imagines itself to be a "someone". A human. A living creature. A thing that is conscious . A thing that has experiences. We might call this the egoic or materialistic state of consciousness. Changing that state of consciousness is necessary for the illusion of ego to dissolve.
</p>

<p>
	It is as if you were a child playing a game of cowboys and Indians, and you are imagining yourself as a cowboy. Is the cowboy real? It's a role that's being played, a mask being worn. You feel like a cowboy because you keep imagining that you are one. Until you stop imagining it. Ego is not a thing, it's an imaginary role you've adopted.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you might imagine yourself to be a woman. But right now you're imagining yourself to be a man. Except you tell yourself that you actually ARE a man, whereas being a woman would be imaginary to you. But both are imaginary. What is a man? A man is not a physical object. A man is a role you've adopted.

<p>
	I've used the Vaporgenie and it's worse than an oil pipe. And the vapor does not sting any less.
</p>

<p>
	If you suck in pure DMT, it's gonna sting the hell out of your lungs. No way around that.
</p>

<p>
	Vaporgenie wastes a lot of DMT as it cools all along the inside of the glass. The more glass you got the more DMT vapor will stick to it. Fancy glass is a gimmick. All you need is a 4 inch oil pipe. Simple and efficient. Invest in a heavy duty torch lighter. If you're using a cheap lighter that will create more problems than it's worth.

<p>
	Oil pipe and torch lighter is so simple and easy. The only challenge is holding that shit in your lungs as it stings.
</p>

<p>
	Work on your inhale technique. That's key if you want to take big doses. You need to fully exhale and then inhale very slow but deep. The DMT is useless in your mouth, you must suck it deep down into the lungs until it stings so bad you can barely stand it.
</p>

<p>
	I think the inhale technique is more important than the pipe you use. A tiny oil pipe can generate more vapor than your lungs can stand.
</p>

<p>
	Work on your inhale technique. That's the key. Practice taking inhales through a straw for 30-45 seconds straight, and deep into your lungs.
</p>

<p>
	And then hold that shit in until you are dying. Do not let it out of you until you are gasping for air.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out! Deep inhales are a whole new ballgame. You will blast out of your skull.
</p>

	No pilot has a progressional telephoto lens mounted in his cockpit.

<p>
	Think before you speak.
</p>

<p>
	Military camera footage is very low quality. They ain't in the business of photo journalism.
</p>

<p>
	And military high res footage of alien craft would be classified top secret and locked in a vault.

	I have no interest in debating female attraction with females.
</p>

<p>
	Female attraction is something a man should learn through direct experience and then keep his mouth shut.

<p>
	There is no brain. You are imagining it. You are imagining all of science too. It's pure fiction.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Love is not a feeling. It's direct consciousness of Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way around direct consciousness of Absolute Truth. If you don't have it, no amount of logic will help you. All logic is fiction. All skepticism is fiction. Everything is fiction.
</p>

<p>
	You are stuck because you refuse to do the work of deconstructing your mind. Start by realizing that science is imaginary.

<p>
	Women are capable of it. But they have little interest in it.
</p>

<p>
	The situation is so bad that I have simply given up on trying to explain attraction to women. It's a pointless effort. I know precisely what attracts them and I simply will embody it. No explanations or discussions.

<p>
	Women are generally not truthful about what they are attracted to because what they tell themselves is one thing, and what they actually respond to is another.
</p>

<p>
	Women create romanticized versions of attraction which suit their fantasies.
</p>

<p>
	To understand what women are actually attracted to requires attracting lots of women. Attraction is ridiculously counter-intuitive and brutal.

<p>
	Not much.
</p>

<p>
	Vegas has cheap rents and you can get into all clubs for free on Sun-Thurs. Now they charge $10 for parking, used to be free. Buying drinks is not needed at all.
</p>

<p>
	Your only expenses are rent and parking.
</p>

<p>
	Living on the Strip is pricey and not needed. A small Strip condo would cost $2k/month. Off the Strip you can find decent apartments for $1000/mo
</p>

<p>
	If you want to go clubbing on Fri and Saturday -- the hottest days -- that will cost you $40/night.
</p>

<p>
	Day game can be very effective and more enjoyable than bars/clubs.
</p>

<p>
	Day game really requires the right location. For example, LA is amazing for day game. That's like the only game you need in LA.

	Never trust a scumbag PUA's numbers. He lies for a living and you trust his numbers?
</p>

<p>
	He would not hesitate to inflate them 90%. It's great for business and ego alike.
</p>

<p>
	This is the problem with manipulative people, you can't ever trust them. A pro PUA is gaming his guy customers as much as he games his girls.

	Another title for this thread:
</p>

<p>
	Do you like knowing how your sausage is made?
</p>

<p>
	Girls don't give a fuck how the guy became attractive. They only care that he's attractive. If he had to kill 10 babies to get there, she does not care. But she will freak out if he tells her what it took for him to become a strong man.

<p>
	It's a two-sided lightsaber. Women are attracted to it like moths to a flame, and then act surprised when they get burned.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to sleep with a knight in shining armor, he will have some bloodstains and he will turn his aggression on you at some point.
</p>

<p>
	Women are attracted to leadership, and leadership correlates highly with ego and narcissism. Don't have to, but often does.

<p>
	I think he still has a lot of deep narcissistic and toxic patterns in him that will be very difficult to unwire -- simply due to his upbringing and his deep entanglement with pickup and sexual pursuits.
</p>

<p>
	But you can certainly learn a lot from him. He has some great content.

<p>
	That's like saying, I like the CAPACITY for racism, but not racism.
</p>

<p>
	The capacity for barbarism when called for is exactly what leads to barbarism. All barbarism is justified in the mind of its executor as called for.
</p>

<p>
	Barbarism is basically nothing other ensuring the survival of your family at all costs. Who were the barbarians? They were literally fighting off Roman Imperial domination. Bravehart style. Your knight in shining armor who doesn't hesitate to chop some heads off to protect his woman. Of course women like that for reason of self-preservation.

<p>
	Silly to assume that animals don't experience pleasure from orgasm.
</p>

<p>
	A cat experiences pleasure from a head rub.
</p>

<p>
	I find it odd for a pro-vegan person to take this position.
</p>

<p>
	If rubbing your cat's head is considered good for the cat, why not elsewhere?

<p>
	Keep questioning and deconstructing your mind/reality deeper, until the mind collapses into Infinity. Enjoy the process. Don't make it such a chore.

	What's real is whatever you imagine. You are the creator of reality.

<title>Why do extreme physical conditions help enlightenment if they can also hurt it?</title>

<p>
	You need to distinguish between conscious suffering, which leads to ego dissolution vs impairments to the functioning of mind and consciousness: like a hammer to the head -- which will not raise your consciousness nor dissolve the ego. It will just leave you struggling for basic survival.
</p>

<p>
	Strong determination sitting may cause extreme pain, but it does not dull your mind. If it did then it would be counter-productive. Your mind needs to be sharp. Which is why a bad diet is terrible for consciousness work. Prolonged fasting can also impair the mind is counter-productive ways.
</p>

<p>
	If you're going to suffer, you must find ways that don't actually impair the mind's functioning. Stress yourself but don't break yourself.
</p>

	Why should a human?

<p>
	When you realize there is no difference between you and rock, you got it.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that a human should have a self is the dumbest unquestioned idea of all time. It's just so dumb when you think about it. Why would anything have a self?
</p>

<p>
	Obviously nothing has a self.

<p>
	Asking women questions upon open is terrible. You quickly lose her with your interrogation. Instead, either make funny assumptions about her or talk about yourself. My fave way to open is just telling her about my day or where I traveled recently. Travel stories are the best.
</p>

<p>
	Stop the questions. Make statements. Learn to carry the entire conversation. You should be able to talk for 5 minutes without needing any input from her.

	I think I could get through to JP better than Sam Harris. I can appeal to JP's sense of God and actually explain God to him. The same cannot be said for Harris. Harris will deny it till the cows come home.
</p>

<p>
	But both would be very difficult to navigate. It would be like walking a tight rope at the circus with the crowd throwing tomatoes at you. Their fanbases will be very hostile. That is the problem with these big name public intellectuals. They have too much to lose from a deep conversation about truth.

I would never imagine i would have to listen to such low conscious selfish people about "how to be an awesome guy". I am just trying to pick the gold nuggets and remove all the narcissism and selfishness from it. Separate gold from shit basically.

<p>
	I never said he was awesome per se.
</p>

<p>
	Girls get attracted to narcissistic and sociopathic men who know how to push their emotional buttons and have balls.
</p>

<p>
	As a human being, John is bottom of the barrel. But from the perspective of attracting girls, this is a positive.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not telling you to be like John. I'm telling you to be a good person but adopt some the excitement and charm of a scumbag narcissist.
</p>

<p>
	Bottom line: stop being boring. Girls hate boring. Girls would rather sleep with a murder than a boring dude.

<p>
	With them you gotta be gentler and sweeter. But still, don't shower them with compliments before sex.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely don't ever make fun of a girl's weight unless she is skinny like a toothpick.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of trial and error to calibrate your teasing to make sure you don't go overboard. Most girls are insecure and easily offended, which will kill rapport. Only do enough teasing to get her attracted. Then dial it way back to build rapport.
</p>

<p>
	Always hard stop a walking girl. Run in front of her with a bit of extra room, do a u-turn and stop her cold.
</p>

<p>
	Opener can be anything, but something like, "Hi, I know this seems awkward, but I just saw you and had to come talk to you. Don't worry, I'm awesome."

<p>
	Well, this very much depends and is subjective.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't be creepy or threatening. That's basically all the etiquette required.

<p>
	Hot girls are not that common during the day. If you see one, you should approach. I've never had the problem where there are too many hot girls in one area to approach. This would be a very high quality problem.

<p>
	You should approach every girl you're genuinely attracted to. And even some you aren't.

<p>
	5 day time approaches is about right. Try to make them solid. Depends on location and availability of girls.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Don't worry about what other people think of you. Just focus on doing a solid approach.
</p>

<p>
	You can approach a girl at a dinner table with 10 people and ask her to stand up and talk to you. It doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
	I've literally opened girls by reaching my hand across a dinner table of 10. It's quite the showstopper if you manage to stay cool as you do it. <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Push yourself to do some ballsy approaches. Just don't be fucking creepy.
</p>

<p>
	As a real test, try hitting on a girl at the mall while she's walking with her mother and father. That'll grow some hair on your balls <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" /> Make sure she looks over 18.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In this context, if sex is close to happening, she's already attracted to you. We are talking about a much further phase in the process.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction >> Rapport >> Seduction.
</p>

<p>
	This is the Seduction phase. If your seduction is failing, you fucked up at the Rapport phase. Once you're past the Attraction phase, she is guaranteed to sleep with you as long as you handle the Rapport and Seduction properly, and you squash all the logistical obstacles.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta practice and master each phase. Attraction and Rapport are the hardest.
</p>

<p>
	Turn that shit on it's head!
</p>

<p>
	Tell her that she reminds you of a pig. In a joking way.
</p>

<p>
	"Okay, okay, I guess you're kinda cute, but I bet you snore like pig."
</p>

<p>
	"Awww... Look, you have little hairs on your leg. Reminds me of a pig."
</p>

<p>
	The hotter the girl, the less you should compliment her beauty. Hot girls get complimented ALL THE TIME. What the hot girl really wants is a guy who has the balls to call out her bullshit and who is not impressed with her hotness. You have to be strong enough to be able to own her.
</p>

<p>
	You must treat hot girls as though they are not hot at all. She must feel that her hotness does not impress you.
</p>

<p>
	My general rule is I don't compliment women, and if I do, I try to do it sarcastically. Mostly chumps compliment women. It's a low value move. Make her work for a compliment.
</p>

<p>
	She's not the prize. I am the prize! << That is the proper frame of a high value male.
</p>

<p>
	Attracting hot girls is deeply counter-intuitive. You're doing everything backwards, which is why they run from you.

<p>
	I would talk to JP or Sam Harris or the Weinstein's -- the problem is I very much doubt they would be open to it. And I don't know how far the conversations could go. We would get hung up very quickly.
</p>

<p>
	My conversation with Charlie was smooth and we went deep. But that's only because he's got the right kind of mind for this work, which is rare. People like JP, Sam Harris, Weinstein's, etc tend to have a lot of personal agenda clouding their minds. Which makes going deep rather hard. I'd be curious just to see how far it would go. There would be a lot of defense mechanisms triggered very quickly because they have a certain worldview to defend on behalf of their loyal audiences. Then it becomes more like a debate, which isn't good.
</p>

<p>
	What's needed is hosts who don't have a worldview that they are defending/promoting -- because of course their worldview cannot be ultimately true. Because all worldviews are biased and partial.

<p>
	So I've started opening myself up more to doing interviews and appearances on other podcasts and channels.
</p>

<p>
	Today I recorded a 2hr conversation with Charlie from Charisma On Command. Not sure yet when he will publish it but I'll let you know.
</p>

<p>
	But anyhow, I am gonna try to do more public appearances over the next year. If you have any favorite podcasts or YT channels that you watch which you think would be suitable and open to have deep conversations about the kind of topics I talk about, please share links below. Ideally include a brief explanation/description of why you think it's a good fit.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that I am not looking to do confrontational debates against ideologues. To do an interview/convo the owner of the podcast or YT channel needs to demonstrate a high degree of openmindedness and meta-cognition, otherwise it will mostly be a waste of time.

	Haha! How naive. The majority of the world's wealth was accumulated through theft, exploitation, lies, deception, fraud, tax evasion, corruption, bribery, monopoly, backstabbing, extortion, slavery, murder, assassination, and war.

<p>
	Where did Trump get all his money? Hint: It wasn't through providing massive value to the world. Look at all the richest men in the world. Every single one of them stole or exploited to get it -- if not worse. It is impossible to earn a billion dollars without some serious, world-class levels of exploitation. Only a deeply selfish and unconscious man could stomach it.

	Because everyone is spammed to death online all the time. Ain't no high value girl checking her DMs for a boyfriend request.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because doing a street approach takes balls. For every 99 online approaches she gets 1 real life approach. The real life approach is an honest signal. Very few guys can pull it off well. If you can pull it off well you automatically place yourself first in the line into her pants.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you hate doing real life approaches is precisely the thing that makes them so effective. They cull out all the losers and pussies.
</p>

<p>
	If you're wise you should want approaching hot girls to be as difficult as possible. So that nobody else does it but you.
</p>

<p>
	When you take the easiest path, so does everyone else, and you all end up with scraps. But he who takes the hardest path ends up with the whole pie all to himself.

<title>Day game: minimizing flakes</title>

			So I'm getting a lot of flakes and it is frustrating.
		</p>

		<p>
			One accepted my offer to take a walk and get coffee and stopped responding. Another one, doesn't respond to my text at all.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Flake rate is high regardless of what you do. It's a numbers game. Even a 5% close rate would be awesome.
</p>

<p>
	But of course you can improve your conversion rate. Always push for an instant coffee date. If you can get her into an instant coffee date this will increase your rate a lot.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem is that you need more time with her to build a connection. This is very hard to do in 5 minutes. So the more time you can persuader her to spend with you, getting to know you, the more of an impact you'll have and the more she will remember you when you text.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind many attractive girls have boyfriends. You should screen them for it early on so as not to waste your time. If she has a boyfriend she will not text you back. Don't waste your time. Screen girls.
</p>

		<p>
			At one point she said she was in a hurry, so I started to wrap things up, tell her I want to take her to get a coffee: she accepts.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Push for instant coffee. Don't let her run off with empty promises. A promise from a girl is less than worthless.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			I yell at her to text me back but she just ignores me. She had earphones in though.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Never do that. You clearly failed to attract her and she was just looking for any excuse to leave without a hassle. Yelling at her to call you back is needy as fuck and therefore she never will.
</p>

<p>
	Girls will give out their number easily just to get to you leave them alone. So shooting for numbers is pointless. You need to shoot for building attraction and connection. If you don't build attraction + connection the number is useless. One deep connection is worth 50 numbers.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			I'm starting to see a pattern. When shit starts getting real and we are making plans girls always flake on me. I don't really know what I'm doing wrong.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Two things:
</p>

<p>
	1) Nothing is going wrong per se. Most girls will simply not sleep with you no matter how good you are. Just increase your numbers.
</p>

<p>
	2) You are not grabbing her attention enough. You are not being attractive enough. You are not being memorable enough. You are not building connection enough. You are not stimulating her emotionally enough. You are not being fun and playful enough. You are not telling her enough about yourself.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Probably it is the neediness? Maybe something else? I'm trying not to be needy but it is hard not to pretend to be needy when I'm simply needy. To be clear: in the conversations I'm not needy but they just can sense it.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The bigger problem is simply lack of building connection. She has little reason to call you back because in her mind you take up as much mental real estate as an ant. You need to do something to grab her attention and get her invested in you. Your job is to give her a strong sense of who you are, how cool you would be to date, how lucky she would be to date you. But without saying that explicitly. Tell more cool and interesting stories about yourself. You need to strike a chord with her and draw her in with interesting stories that display your value. For example, tell her about cool places you've traveled to, spiritual work you're doing, business projects you're working on, your dreams, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And, of course, flirt with her and make her laugh.
</p>

	Because it doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
	And casting pearls before swine is exhausting.
</p>

<p>
	Helping lots of people requires accumulating power, which is antithetical to Truth, Consciousness, and Love.

<p>
	It's hard to say for sure.

<p>
	Depends on many factors.

<p>
	I would make sure to exhaust all material options first. Don't use a spiritual technique to heal what can be healed at the material level.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	But it must be a DMSA provoked urine test.
</p>

<p>
	If DMSA yields heavy metals in your urine you know for sure it came from your body.
</p>

<p>
	But still, this test does not tell you how much is stored in your body. It only tells you how much you pissed out.
</p>

<p>
	There is no test that can tell you your entire body load. So you keep detoxing until one day your piss comes out clean.

<p>
	Not necessarily.
</p>

<p>
	You need a urine test. The urine test is the only objective measure. You can't rely on negative side-effects. I have almost never felt any negative side effects from detox, but I benefited from it greatly and my urine was objectively toxic from the start.
</p>

<p>
	By being lazy and cheap with the testing you end up costing yourself more in the end.
</p>

<p>
	I also would not trust ALA by itself. You need DMSA too. It's crucial in my opinion.
</p>

<p>
	Detox is a thing that needs to be done rigorously, not half-assed. By half-assing it you will not get clear results and soon quit. Detox is a long-term investment. It is not an effortless magic pill.
</p>

	I was not talking to you nor making any fuss. I was answering the guy's question about how I avoid approval seeking. If you don't like my strategy, don't use it.
</p>

<p>
	Just the way you read my posts betrays how selfish your perceptions of me are. Hence why should I care about your approval when it is more about you than about me?

<p>
	It's not about hate.

<p>
	You gotta feel the sting of your errors so you stop doing it. Your actions with hot women are precisely backwards, which is why you get no results.
</p>

<p>
	Stop supplicating to beautiful women, grow a spine, and you will start to see results. Although not via some Twitter attention whore. Get your vaccine and start talking to women face to face if you want to improve your game.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to weasle your way into a girl's pants via Twitter is no good.

<p>
	You don't need dick extension surgery if you are hung like Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone doing professional sports is exceptionally genetically gifted. Such people are in the top 1% of the bell curve. If they weren't they would not even have a chance to compete. Merely the cost of entry into that arena is having top 1% genetics. This is true of all sports. Which is why all competitive sports are stupid. All you're doing is comparing genetic lottery numbers while telling yourself how good you are. You are only that good because you had the foundation to be that good. You didn't create the foundation, God gave it to you.
</p>

<p>
	This is true of all the world's greatest mystics. The dirty secret is that they didn't do it, they were given it. And Bashar is no exception to this. The idea that some technique will replace the right foundation is one of the greatest scams in human history. Foundation will always trump technique and effort.

I have a few questions after watching the new video about survival.
		</p>

		<p>
			1. What are some ways to change up our ingrained patterns and habits?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There's no shortcut to Just do it
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			2. What specific things did you do to stop craving external approval? Looking for a "relative" solution because I'm still handling my survival and am probably years away from any meaningful degree of enlightenment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I try to replace feelings of love I get from hearing approval with my own internal love generated by my spiritual connection to consciousness itself.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, cut off external feelings of love and reground your sense of love directly in consciousness and being. Or you could reground love into the doing of your art/work. Also, I remind myself that people who praise me are usually not very conscious and only do so out of selfishness. If I was a rapist no one would praise me. And there is no reason why I deserve any more praise now than if I was a rapist. So people's praise of me has nothing to do with reality. It's just their self-biased projections -- which I have little interest in. My love cannot be grounded in the projections of others.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			3. Can efficient survival methods disguise as passions? For example: someone really enjoys basketball, spends hours playing it every day, and dreams about being an amazing basketball player, while studying the more boring engineering in college – fits the passion narrative. They become really good at it, maybe one of the best at their school. But upon introspecting they realize they've pushed themselves to excel at basketball because it was their way to gain status and approval from guys and girls in high school and college ("omg look how good he is at basketball!"),
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's very common.
</p>

<p>
	However, that can lead to a genuine passion. Or not. It depends.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			and that it's not that meaningful to them
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But it could be meaningful to them. Or it could not. If it is not, then obviously there's a problem. But if it becomes genuinely meaningful then it's less of a problem.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Is basketball that person's passion?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Usually a passion is not something that raises much doubt in your mind. If you're very doubtful about it, then it probably isn't your passion. But if you just love the thing for no good reason -- that's a sign of genuine passion. You love it for its own sake -- that's passion.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			4. It seems like our "authentic self" is just a collection of past experiences and can change a lot.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Indeed
</p>

<p>
	But there is also a kernel to the psyche's personality which does not change, it only gets obscured like the sun on a cloudy day.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Let's say someone wanted to be an artist, but had to go into business after college due to circumstances, which was much less enjoyable than art. Eventually they learned to enjoy business and made it meaningful and impactful in a positive way (life purpose), maybe even incorporating a little bit of art into it. Does it really make sense at this point to say they're authentically an artist?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, it depends. The person could have stumbled into a second passion or even a higher passion. You can have multiple passions and you can also find higher passions than your existing ones. But it's also very common that a person will talk themselves out of truly pursing their passion (like art) because it is not as practical or "realistic" as something like business. They can also be interested in business, but deep down they know that business is not truly as exciting as art. But they are too scared to drop business and go all-in on art. So they talk themselves into settling for business.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming an artist requires way more courage than becoming a businessman.
</p>

<p>
	A good book is self-validating.
</p>

<p>
	If you need some authority figure to tell you that Mastery is a powerful book, you got some serious problems with your head.
</p>

<p>
	Stop seeking popular stuff. Popular stuff is designed for morons. Which is why it became popular. Because most people are morons.

<p>
	To anyone reading this and learning about Turquoise, be warned that most of the examples in this thread are not Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	Go read the SD book Turquoise section.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightened people are not automatically Turquoise. It is a dangerous mistake to assume so. Awakening and cognitive development are not the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Examples of Turquoise are difficult to cite because A) they are quite rare, and B) the people citing them are themselves not Turquoise so they don't understand what they are citing.

<p>
	1) Many programmers lead very unhealthy lifestyles. And they will pay for it long-term.
</p>

<p>
	2) Some people have stronger energy/health just naturally and can work twice was much as other people. Genetics plays a big role. Do not just assume that all humans have the same stamina. Some people have way more stamina than others. And the food you eat over your lifetime greatly affects this too.
</p>

<p>
	3) People who work that much often end up sick or burned out after 10 years.

<p>
	Yes, because you have not realized yet what Truth is.
</p>

<p>
	Your doubts are perfectly understandable, but ultimately silly and misguided. And unfortunately there is no way to get you to realize that until you have a deep awakening. Until then you may think that enlightenment could be a self-deception, but that is your self-deception.

<p>

	You have not discovered some brilliant flaw in enlightenment. Haha.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth cannot be doubted, since it is the source of your doubting ability.

	Something is fundamentally broken. The ego-mind has fragmented reality into pieces. Wholeness is missing. Which is why happiness and peace is missing. Restoring that wholeness requires working on yourself.

<p>
	Be ware of people who poo-poo personal development.
</p>

<p>
	And of course there are many ways of doing personal development dysfunctionally.
</p>

<p>
	The question isn't whether you should do personal development or not. The question is, what is the proper way to do?

<p>
	When you are highly conscious you become stronger at maintaining your values and not compromising on them. Integrity increases with consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse Love with pleasing people or feminine compassion. Sometimes Love is harsh and brutal, as in masculine compassion.
</p>

<p>
	A few weeks ago I got into a such an fight with my dentist because he refused to give me a refund for his incompetent work that they were ready to call the police on me. Hehe... I nearly knocked his door down. Walked away with a $1500 refund.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes you gotta bash some doors in to get your way because some people do not understand anything else. And none of this is incompatible with Love or consciousness. Of course the door was dashed only as a last resort when other more conscious options were exhausted. Don't be afraid to bash a door down when the situation calls for it.
</p>

<p>
	Love and Consciousness != meekness

<p>
	No politician in the US has pushed for literal forced vaccinations.
</p>

<p>
	The "force" in this case is just peer pressure and public shaming. And perhaps some businesses like airlines and stadiums might require it to give you services. Which I think is perfectly natural and healthy.
</p>

<p>
	Since most Covid deniers are sheep, I think they will eventually just conform and get the vaccines once everyone else does and there are no problems. These people just like to whine and make noise like pouting children. Eventually they will grow tired of pouting and come to the dinner table.

<p>
	We have had forced vaccinations for the last 100 years.
</p>

<p>
	All school children are forced to get vaccines to enter school. University too. I had to get a shot to enter university.
</p>

<p>
	Society is held together by force sometimes. That is a precondition for having nice things. You have never been free do endanger others in a society. Because all our lives are at stake and we are in the same fucking boat. If Covid hasn't made that clear to you, I don't know what will.

	Possibly. I don't know how many people would use this function. I think most people are not this nerdy about it.

<p>
	We could try creating such a thread and see how much interest it sparks and the quality of the submissions. Wading through low-quality submissions would also be a chore.

<title>Actualized Clips Channel Launching Now!</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The new Actualized Clips channel has just launched.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFc8wPBHyLl_cJphb6hDSIw/videos" rel="external nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFc8wPBHyLl_cJphb6hDSIw/videos</a>
</p>

<p>
	It only has 10 clips so far, but there will be daily releases of more clips and within a few months it will have 100s of clips.
</p>

<p>
	Strictly-speaking there is no new content on the clips channel. It's just my long episodes clipped up. But if you are too impatient to watch the long-assed episodes, these clips give you the highlights. It also makes it easier to share with friends and family.
</p>

<p>
	Constructive feedback welcomed. My editor and I are still working to polish this channel up, so expect the clips to get better over time as we learn what works and what doesn't.
</p>

<p>
	Subscribe and hit the Bell if you want to get notifications for new clip releases.
</p>

<p>
	His claims strike me as generic platitudes.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing actionable in what he said. You cannot actually use his advice to reach DMT levels of consciousness. He does not tell you how to actually do it. He just says believe in yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You could listen to Bashar for 5 hours or you could just smoke some DMT. See which one gets you more consciousness.

<p>
	Destiny's whole attitude was disrespectful and insulting. He acted as though Wolff's position and definition of socialism is obscure or unclear, when even a bit of basic watching of Wolff's videos will clearly tell you how he defines socialism. Asking Wolff to define socialism shouldn't have even been a point of debate since Destiny should have done his homework and already been well-aware that Wolff is advocating for democracy at the workplace. It's even in the name of his damned YT channel.
</p>

<p>
	Destiny came off as a bratty, pouting child, feigning ignorance of what is meant by socialism.

<title>Bashar On Psychedelics</title>

<p>
	Think of it like this: anyone can go to the gym and put on muscle. Everyone's body can naturally create testosterone -- even women! But you will never naturally achieve this look:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="ronnie01.jpg" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed" data-fileid="34535" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2021_04/ronnie01.jpg.e791eb5f5e4971e3b346b90e204f9f81.jpg" style="width:300px;height:auto;" />
</p>

<p>
	Your body cannot produce that much natural testosterone. And to tell newbies that it can is utterly irresponsible and misleading.
</p>

<p>
	No gym technique will give you that look. The only way to get that look is to inject testosterone.
</p>

<p>
	If you insist on going "all natural" -- fine. But you will not be as conscious as one who takes psychedelics. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
	You are like a woman thinking you can be Ronnie Coleman while drinking your soy as long as you hit the gym hard enough. No!
</p>

<p>
	Shinzen Young did 40 years of professional meditation. I can be more conscious than him in 15 minutes. That is the reality of how this works. You can make all the rationalizations you want, but the brute reality remains.
</p>

	Your memories, just like the Earth you think you're sitting on, is imaginary.

	School only exists in your mind. EVERYTHING only exists in your mind. You are God dreaming. This is a dream. The end.

<p>
	A good example of how both sides are failing to communicate and understand each other in a Game A rather than Game B manner. Both are acting cocky without trying to hear the important points made by the other. Destiny acts more cocky and fails to allow space for a new system to be considered. Wolff fails to appreciate that the best elements of capitalism will not go away, they will be used as the foundation for what comes next. And what comes next will not be limited to socialism.
</p>

<p>
	The solution will not be capitalism or socialism. It will be a higher level emergent which integrates the best elements of both in a holistic and harmonious way.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Over 100 million doses of vaccine have been administered. If there were significant deaths we would know about it. No one is keeping that a secret. And vaccine deaths are not gonna be delayed by months and years. They would happen rapidly.
</p>

<p>
	There have only been a total of 32 million cases of Covid in the US. Covid spreads much slower than the vaccine.
</p>

<p>
	For the vaccine to warrant not being taken it would have to have killed sometime like 1 million people by now. Which just shows you how absurdly out of reason the anti-vax fearmongering is. I don't know if there's even been 10 people who died from the vaccine. And you'd need 1 million of them to make a reasonable case against it. Even 10,000 vaccines deaths would not be a reasonable case.
</p>

<p>
	100 million doses is such a huge number that the mind has difficulty reasoning about it properly. Out of 100 million, more people will die from eating lettuce or slipping on ice than taking the vaccine.

<p>
	What is the point of injecting it if you can just plug it? Needless danger.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA is notoriously impure. Injecting a substance which is only 85% pure into your bloodstream is dumb. Injection requires extremely pure chemicals. 99%+ purity. MDMA is never above 85% purity at best, and much lower at worst.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA is also one of the few psychedelics you can realistically overdose on and kill yourself. MDMA can also permanently change the wiring of your brain -- and not in a good way.

<p>
	All you gotta do is look at the number of people who died from Covid vs number of people who died from the Covid vaccine.
</p>

<p>
	It's not even close.
</p>

<p>
	Case closed.
</p>

<p>
	And Covid produces more side-effects and long-term health complications too! It's not just death. The side-effects from Covid are much worse than the side-effects from the Covid vaccine. And that doesn't even factor in the economic costs of people not getting vaccinated.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, if you wind up in the hospital, you lose $5000 right there. Not even counting the time you lose which you could be spending on your life purpose.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I made no such point.
</p>

<p>
	One's growth is irrelevant when the topic at hand is the state of consciousness acheivable via DMT. The state is the state. Whether you benefit from it or not is irrelevant. How long it lasts is irrelevant. You cannot acheive that state "naturally". You can acheive higher states naturally, but not that high. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
	People who say they can have simply never had a serious DMT breakthrough. They don't know what they are talking about and they have no idea what consciousness is capable of on a vaped DMT peak. It is nothing a human can imagine or will into being. It would be easier to grow your dick by 6 inches than to will yourself into a DMT peak.
</p>

<p>
	No yogi, nor meditator, nor enlightened person is able to do that. No technique will get you there.

</p>

<p>
	Finding your niche is a journey and an ordeal. Don't give up and don't settle for a dead end job. You can get a wage job to hold you over but your eyes must be towards finding your niche, where the work you do fits your values and your talents.
</p>

<p>
	You have to think outside the box. I knew a guy who was a nature hiking guide in Wyoming or Montana. He lived a simple life in mountains and in the summers he would give hiking and canoo tours to tourists.
</p>

<p>
	Find your niche. It doesn't have to be in the city.
</p>

<p>
	I knew another guy who quit Wall Street to travel around the country doing Japanese swordfighting and Zen meditation. He lived and slept out of his van. He made money as a roving massage therapist.

<p>
	Yeah, that's the bitch, breaking into heaven and then falling back down into petty human affairs.
</p>

<p>
	With time you will forget about heaven and the human crap becomes a bit more tolerable.

</p>

<p>
	You are not going to create a DMT breakthrough by will. To feed newbies this idea is beyond irresponsible. That's like telling a Covid patient he can cure himself by will, and if he can't, he's just not trying hard enough.

	Nobody is recreating DMT breakthroughs naturally. Pure bullshit. You might as well sprout wings and fly.

	Dulse goes well with my soup. Try it. Chew the dulse like bread as you eat the soup. It makes for a nice combo.

	Good luck recreating a breakthrough DMT trip at will. Not gonna happen. Your will is not that strong.

Do not discourage regular people from getting the vaccine. This is irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
	No one has ever said that vaccines don't have some very rare side effects. Every medicine and chemical has rare side effects. That is not sufficient reason to discourage their use for average people.
</p>

<p>
	If you fed peanuts to 100 million people, some would have severe reactions. That is not a case against peanuts.
</p>

<p>
	Covid kills 1000s of people. This vaccines does not.
</p>
