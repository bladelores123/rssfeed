<p>
	The point is to maximize consciousness and love across all living beings.

<p>
	You are very naive about how corporations do business & about white collar crime.
</p>

<p>
	The entire political system is deliberately designed to redistribute wealth upwards to the most powerful. There is nothing arbitrary about it. That is right-wing trickle down economics.
</p>

<p>
	Weakening the government by going the "limited government" route will only make this problem worse.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be a limited government when greater levels of social organization require massively complex management systems. You cannot have all of today's modern technological luxuries while also organizing government via caveman politics.
</p>

<p>
	With caveman government you get caveman lifestyle.

<p>
	Spirituality is about facing your fears and realizing that all fear is illusion.
</p>

<p>
	The whole function of life is learn how to love vs fear. That is really the only thing you're doing here in life. Everything is just a variation on this theme. Take a look.

<p>
	Your views of how government and capitalism work are very naive.
</p>

<p>
	Capitalism IS a redistribution of resources to giant corporations and the most powerful and manipulative people, which undermines democracy. Social democracy is a check on that redistribution of wealth to elites. Elites use capitalism to extract massive amounts of wealth from the rest of society regardless of the damage it causes.
</p>

<p>
	Democracy + capitalism is a contradiction. There is no such thing. If you have capitalism you have anti-democracy because money buys all politicians. This leads to corporatism, plutocracy, and corruption. Corruption is not a function of evil people doing bad things, it's a function of money infecting the democratic process in a systemic way.
</p>

<p>
	The Kochtopus is still thriving. It goes way beyond any one individual. It's an ideology and a super-organism that takes on a life of its own.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to The Family Netflix documentary. Just because Doug Kho is dead, doesn't mean The Family isn't a big problem in politics.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise with Trumpism. Trumpism will be a problem even after Trump leaves office because it is a larger ideological force.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about attacking Trump, it's about making people aware of the larger systemic forces and self-deceptions at work which lead to devils like Trump and Koch bros to thrive.

	You could also try sub-lingual. Might work better for you than plugging.

	I'm amazed though how well plugging works for me with all psychedelics. It's just perfect for me. The only substance it hasn't worked for is NN-DMT.

<p>
	You misunderstand Osho. I see people here quoting spiritual masters in such twisted ways, where you end up doing the every opposite of what they teach.
</p>

<p>
	It makes sense to you because it is music to a devil's ears. A devil loves nothing more than to hear a great teacher give him permission to be a devil.

<title>How to stop enjoying pornography?</title>

<p>
	It's not about stopping enjoying it. It's about finding a higher purpose in your life, something that you find more meaningful.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to stop enjoying porn.
</p>

<p>
	And there's nothing wrong with enjoying porn either. Porn is just part of the beauty of reality. Be grateful it exists.
</p>

<p>
	It means you imagine it.
</p>

<p>
	It exists only because you create it. If you stop creating it, it will stop existing.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a matter of belief. It is a matter of becoming conscious of how you are creating it.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you are not yet conscious of how you are creating your own brith. You have confused the idea of your birth for some real event outside your own mind. It doesn't even occur to you that your birth could be imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, you are basically insane, imagining stuff like a psychotic. The most importing thing you are imagining is that you are not imagining but that its all real.
</p>

<p>
	That's precisely the kind of attitude that a devil will exploit to his advantage.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that a devil doesn't play fair. That's what makes him a devil. If you give him the benefit of the doubt, he will exploit it. Which is why once some proves himself to be a pathological liar, narcissist, or con artist you should never take him seriously again. The way a con artist works is precisely by conning you and then repenting and exploiting your soft heart to con you a second and third time.
</p>

<p>
	Trump behave exactly in this matter. Which is why nothing that comes out of his mouth can ever be given the benefit of the doubt. Given his past history, everything that comes out of his mouth should be considered a lie unless proven otherwise. That is how you properly deal with a con artist. You don't trust him ever again.

<p>
	What we really need long-term is a new transformative technology that will either: 1) remove carbon from the atmosphere, and/or, 2) block sunlight from reaching the Earth in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	I envision a sort of giant thin film set up in space which simply blocks sunlight from reaching the planet like sun glasses. With such a technology we would not only eliminate global warming forever but we could actively regulate the temperate on the planet to maximize consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But something like this needs to be funded by big government research.
</p>

<p>
	It's quite obvious that advanced civilizations learn to regulate the climate on their planet.
</p>

<p>
	As a species it's like we're living in the age before air conditioning.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being able to selectively regulate the sunlight in desert regions like the Sahara or the Gobi, making it lush and livable!
</p>

<p>
	We could even install a UV filter so people don't get sunburned.
</p>

<title>Advice on contemplation</title>

<p>
	If you are prone to depression then contemplation could be problematic in the sense that you will get lost inside your own mind. You have to careful here to balance between theory & practice. For a depressed person going to the gym might be more effective to change one's mood than contemplating on the couch about one's mood.
</p>

<p>
	But it the long run you should build yourself up to the point where you can contemplate things without it driving you deeper into depression. As you become more developed and conscious it will be easier for you to let go of being stuck in your own mind. Kriya yoga & meditation helps a lot with this.
</p>

<p>
	If all you do is sit and think (without any yoga or meditation practice) you will end up getting lost in your own mind. And this will create various kinds of dysfunction.
</p>

<p>
	So watch out! The mind can be a very dangerous thing. Then again, being mindless can be even more dangerous.
</p>

	JP is actually a smart guy with some good insight into psychology and human nature.
</p>

<p>
	But his politics suck.
</p>

<p>
	There are two very distinct sides to JP: his academic side and his political side. The problem is he mixes them so it's like he prepares you a fine gourmet meal, but with a turd on top.

<p>
	Oh there will be major backlash if Bernie get elected. The corporatists will start flinging shit like never before.
</p>

<p>
	See, we've never seen the corporate elite truly get their feet held to the fire the way Bernie would do.
</p>

<p>
	Big industries like oil and gas, coal, pharma, health insurance, Wall Street, banking, etc. will be in an uproar and will invest billions in ads to manipulate their way back into power.
</p>

<p>
	Billions will pour into the Fox News propaganda machine. It will be get real nasty. They will do everything possible to take Bernie down. Because this hits them right at the heart of their survival agenda: money!
</p>

<p>
	The health insurance industry will fight to the bitter end like a cornered animal because if Bernie get his way, they're dead overnight. They have nothing to lose. They will go down swinging.

<p>
	You're missing the deeper mindfuck here: there are no such things are rocks because a rock does not know it is a rock. You project that "rock" onto the world in the same way you project your own ego.
</p>

<p>
	A rock doesn't really have an age because who is to say what counts as rock vs not-rock? Only your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The true age of the rock is identical to that of your body because they are indistinguishable. Both are Eternal until you project time onto the sitution.

<p>
	Distinction = difference = form = duality
</p>

<p>
	So you are asking, What is difference?
</p>

<p>
	If reality is made out of differences, then what is a difference made out of?
</p>

<p>
	Notice you get a paradox here because if you say, Difference is made out of nothing. That nothing is still a difference. This question cannot be answered at the level of langauge. An awakening is required. You must somehow jump out of the domain of language altogether because all that language is are differences, so you can't use language to understand difference itself. Creating more differences is not the same thing as groking what difference is.

	Most people are not interested in being aware of it because you'd be undermining their very way of life!

<p>
	Self-deception is a VAST topic with many sub-topics. It's the bulk of how humans fool themselves into believing they are human.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that this stuff cannot simply be taught or explained, it requires deep self-reflection, contemplation, and consciousness work -- which virtually nobody is willing to do.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you do it, you'll still get tripped up in self-deception. Self-deception does not joke around. It's seriously deceptive.

	Bernie is more left than Warren obviously.
</p>

<p>
	I prefer to elect the highest leader possible and let the chips fall where they may. The system will deal with it. Gradualism has been tried with Obama and it failed. Another 8 years of someone like Obama is going to make things even worse. The system needs some serious change of the status quo.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie is not a Green version of Trump. Trump is a moronic lying narcissist. Bernie is an intelligent, honest, compassionate leader.
</p>

<p>
	A Green version of Trump would be 20 year old Green Peace activist with bipolar disorder who wants to jail people for eating fish and force children to eat soy, who faces a criminal case for sabotaging factory farms.

	To say that it's such a complex problem that we don't know what to do is absurd. We can start by banning oil companies from paying politicians to lie about climate change. These oil companies have known about climate change (internally) for 50 years!

<p>
	Carbon Tax! There's your answer. But JP is lost in philosophical right-wing distractions.

<p>
	To maintain his anti-SJW position he has to make it seem like climate activism is somehow foolish when it is actually the most obvious thing. What's foolish is criticizing people who care about the environment.

<p>
	Thanks to Bernie the democratic party is much more progressive. Free Healthcare is now supported by many democrats.

<p>
	The most important thing is not policy per se but the changing in collective worldview.

<p>
	The most important thing is not to free the slaves but to get people to realize that slavery is not right. Once people realize that slavery is not right, the freeing of the slaves will be inevitable.

	Moscow Mitch can certainly win in the short term, but not in the long term because he is clearly on the wrong side of history. Because consciousness is always evolving to higher levels. Moscow Mitch can dig his heels in all he wants, but he will eventually lose that battle. Such obvious self-bias will not be sustainable.

<p>
	If the mind is deeply stilled a nondual state of consciousness will eventually set in, because duality is created by an active mind.
</p>

<p>
	But merely 5 minutes of stillness will not be enough. You need long periods of stillness over many days, weeks, months, years. It can't just be a temporary stillness, the mind actually has to rewire itself to be less active by default.
</p>

<p>
	From stillness insight can arise. This insight leads to enlightenment.

	Wait till you realize that clean vs dirty is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	That's when everything goes full-circle and you find yourself smearing your feces on your neighbor's dishes.
</p>

<p>
	Then when he calls the cops and they arrest you, you'll tell them that freedom vs captivity is just a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Then when the prison psychiatrist examines you, and asks you what's wrong with you, you'll tell him that right vs wrong is just a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Then when he suspects you're insane, you'll tell him that that sanity vs insanity is just a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Then they will put you in the insane asylum where you will be safely kept away from infecting the minds of ordinary folks with the Truth.

<p>
	Enlightenment is not about seeing through my eyes. Enlightenment is about something even more radical: realizing you are the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	To realize you are the entire universe does not require you to live through many different lives. You can realize it by staying in your current life.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about becoming multicentered but rather becoming omnipresent/nothing. This does not allow you to see through others eyes. You just realize you are EVERYTHING regardless of what is visible. Your consciousness goes so infinite that visual data simply doesn't matter.
</p>

	Bottomline is: you are too attached to visual forms. They are not important in this pursuit. You need to turn inward and inquire what you are. That will then explode into infinity.
</p>

<p>
	The nothing you find through self-inquiry is also infinity, since nothing and infinity must be identical. This infinity is what connects you to all living beings without any need to look through their eyes.
</p>

<p>
	I don't need to experience your life to know I am you. All I need to do is realize I am infinite.
</p>

<p>
	As the Ehrlich tells you, it's purple and therefore an Indole, which means it's a tryptamine, which means it's probably what the label claims.
</p>

<p>
	There is no test purely for 5-MeO-DMT. All you can test for is Indoles.
</p>

<p>
	You substance looks legit. The color of the powder itself looks good. That looks like some pure 5-MeO.

</p>

<p>
	You are the obstacle to understanding this.
</p>

<p>
	In truth you ARE looking through the eyes of all being simutaneously. One of whom is this human you think you are now. To be a human precisely means that you are only looking through one set of eyes.
</p>

<p>
	To look through the eyes of all humans does not mean you get to compare all their experiences. It means precisely that you are cut off in your own little private world. A trilion private worlds.
</p>

<p>
	It works just like an online mutliplayer game.
</p>

<p>
	You are me writing this comment. But you are so fully me that you don't even know you're you! Because you are fully me! You are so fully me that you have no memory of ever having been you! And vice versa.

</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is that you are imagining being me while still retaining elements of you. No, you have to fully forget yourself. In other words, you must die. Still want to be me?

<p>
	You're talking about here is dual vs nondual states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	In a nondual state of consciousness the notion of a self is missing. You and reality are one. Subject and object are one.
</p>

<p>
	How long it lasts can vary depending on many factors. It could last a minute or a lifetime.

<title>Is Fluoride &quot;Calcifying your Pineal Gland&quot; a myth?</title>

<p>
	It's hard to say. I would avoid it just to be safe. You can find some good organic toothpastes without fluoride. And obviously you should not be drinking tap water. So this is a pretty easy fix. All you gotta do is ditch the cheap chemical toothpaste, which cannot be good for you regardless of the fluoride question.
</p>

<p>
	I have been fluoride free for a couple of years and my teeth are as good as ever. I don't let my dentist use fluoride on me. They can keep that shit for themselves, hehe.

<p>
	Make yourself successful first so that you're not coming from a place of fear or need, then have your kid.
</p>

<p>
	Devote 5-10 years of your life to building a good career/biz. If you do that well, having a kid should not be a problem financially.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like you're very young, so be patient and pace yourself. There's no need to have a kid in your 20s.

<p>
	Majority of people are just for the status quo because they haven't even bothered to think of anything else.
</p>

<p>
	And such people are extremely vulnerable to psychological manipulation, which is what media propaganda does.
</p>

<p>
	Don't give the average person too much credit. 200 years ago, the average person would not have a strong opinion pro or anti slavery. They're just sheep following the herd off a cliff.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, they may even be willing to listen, but they are not willing to think deeply about anything.
</p>

<p>
	Neutrality is an extremely dangerous thing. It gets easily exploited by devils.

But it's a good safe entry point.
</p>

<p>
	50-100mg is where things get serious.
</p>

<p>
	After you reach 50mg, increase in 10mg increments.
</p>

<p>
	If 20mg is barely noticable for you, jump up to 50mg.

<title>The problem with open-mindedness</title>

</p>

<p>
	It's very helpful be keep that in the back of your mind at all times.
</p>

<p>
	Closedminded people will of course project their closedmindedness onto you. That is devilry 101. But be careful because you can easily fall into that trap yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that reality is such that you can never draw any clear & stable lines. When you deeply grok this, you stop worrying about drawing lines. Drawing lines is the chief human delusion. All drawn lines are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	I have not drawn any firm lines. I'm always open to being proven wrong.
</p>

<p>
	But practically, I usually know when someone is bullshitting me because I have a lot of direct experience to fall back on. But even so, I'm still open because my understanding is never complete or perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like a far-right nationalist I would not even bother taking seriously. They are obviously and hopelessly unconscious. It's not worth the time reasoning with them because they are completely in denial about their self-biases.
</p>

<p>
	Just because your mind is open does not mean you have to take every fool seriously.
</p>

<p>
	As a good rule of thumb, before taking a person's intellectual position seriously, I first need to see that he/she has a basic understanding of self-deception and self-bias. If they do not understand the significance of self-deception or self-bias, I can basically guarantee they are deeply deluded and so I will never take them too seriously. I can still learn from them, but it's going to be small potatoes stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Once you have some awakening to the Absolute, that gives you a nice ground for cutting through bullshit. Until then you're really lost in a sea of bullshit with no clear compass to orient yourself because you cannot even know if anything I say is true.
</p>

<p>
	It goes even deeper. There is no difference between fake and real.
</p>

<p>
	The universe cannot tell what is fake, since everything, even fake things, have to be imagined by consciousness, otherwise they would no be at all.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, fake tits are still real, and real tits are just a dream <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	There is a subtle duality in this framing because it assumes that there are "things" which are conscious. Nothing is conscious. There is only consciousness and various illusions of things being conscious.
</p>

<p>
	This framing of "things can be conscious" is a distortion of the ego. Consciousness is prior to things. So things cannot have consciousness. Things are imagined by consciousness.

<p>
	Dry insight tends to work very poorly in my experience.
</p>

<p>
	The key function of psychedelics is to lube up the mind, placing it in a deep samadhi state from which profound insight becomes almost effortless.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are samadhi in a pill.

<p>
	Remember, even if there is a recession, it's not necessarily a big deal. It might just be a few quarters of slowed growth.
</p>

<p>
	It's just too early to tell. People have a tendency to over-exaggerate things. After 10 years of non-stop growth a bit of recession is normal and not a problem. You can't expect never-ending growth.

<p>
	At the epic states of consciousness I've been in, problems cannot even be imagined. They simply make so sense.
</p>

<p>
	A problem is really a delusion.
</p>

<p>
	At such a level of consciousness I cannot even imagine my own death. Death literally becomes impossible. There is a point at which you are too conscious to die.

		</p>

		<p>
			So hate = love, love = hate, as the advanced individual they see both as the same thing because in non-duality everything is one. Does that mean they're basically blind to the fact that people fuck you over and deceive you, since hate and love are the same thing? Or are they instead hyper aware of spotting the bullshit in others but they come from a place of detachment and love? From what I would expect its most likely the latter, and I would say that they probably experience a heightened sense of empathy for those who are ignorant enough to do such a thing to others. Am I correct?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The more awake you are, the more aware you are of deception, the quicker you see through bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	The eye of God cuts through bullshit like a knife through butter.

	It can vary. You may feel nothing at all because you are in total acceptance of it. You don't necessarily need to feel some positive emotion. At other times you may weep for the tragedy of it.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The only way God can hate is via a limited human vehicle.
</p>

<p>
	The pure Godhead cannot hate because it is totally conscious. Total consciousness accepts itself totally. It has no reason to hate anything because hate only arises from partiality and selfishness. You have to be deluded to hate yourself. It is impossible for Infnite Consciousness to be deluded. Unless it first becomes limited consciousness (a human).
</p>

<p>
	To experience hate, God had to invent humans. God experiences hate vicariously through your ego.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Is-ness = Love
</p>

<p>
	But this requires an insight to grok.
</p>

<p>
	It is not enough to only grok is-ness, you can probe deeper into what is-ness is.
</p>

<p>
	You can also notice that is-ness is Emptiness, or Intelligence, or Will. And all of these will be distinct insights. Just because you grok one does not mean you grok them all.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like tasting wine. You can taste it as a noob and only discern 1 or 2 qualities. Or you can taste it like a master and discern 5-10 qualities, even though it's all one wine.
</p>

<p>
	In the end what you're doing is discerning what consciousness is.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness = Truth = Love = Being = Isness = Will = Intelligence = God = Nothing = Infinity = Eternity = Now = Perfection = Goodness = Absolute = Nowhere = All = Oneness = Universe = Self = Divinity

</blockquote>

<p>
	Hard to say as there are probably multiple ways to get there.
</p>

<p>
	There certianly exist mystics who got it without psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	You need a very radical shift in consciousness according to my experience. I call it full God-mode. It's superhuman consciousness beyond anything I can meditate to. But then again, Love is right here right now, at all times. Once you grok it, it's so obvious you can hardly miss it. You don't need to feel love to know it's all around you.

</p>

<p>
	You are just preaching. You are not doing the work.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that your mind is fundamentally stuck on the belief that love cannot be real. And your ego is now busy justifying why you are right.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that you are not actually open to investigating consciousness and discovering whatever it happens to be. You are just rehashing your pre-existing prejudices via the words of others. You have no idea if any of the words you quote are true or false.
</p>

<p>
	This approach cannot work and is a bastardization of this work and a waste of our time.
</p>

<p>
	You do not know what Truth is. Start by admitting that to yourself. Enough games.

	If you really want to change the world, you can find a way to do it. The problem is that you aren't serious enough about it.

	Terrible materialistic video which completely misunderstands the nature of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not a simulation. A simulation is a duality.

<p>
	He's a very complex thinker. Yeah, somewhere between Green & Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	He's probably as high as one can go without direct mystical experiences. That's what he's missing.

<p>
	It's both. Spirituality teaches you detachment. But you don't stop at detachment, you act from detachment with a sense of passion and purpose to improve the world.
</p>

<p>
	One of my core teachings is: You are a creator. Not just a creator, but THE Creator. You are God!
</p>

<p>
	God creates from a place of detachment. To be a powerful creator you must do it from a place of detachment.
</p>

<p>
	The point of life is not merely to awaken but to experiment with being a powerful Creator. The creation is not do out of need or lack, but out of Selfless Love. Creation is its own joy, point, and reward.
</p>

<p>
	This is a point which distinguishes my teaching from something like classic Buddhism, which is only concerned with awakening and escaping the dream. For me, the dream has value in that it allows for creation! This is God's sandbox! Create something cool which gives you joy and uplifts all living begins.
</p>

<p>
	Tolerating everything will make you a very powerful creator.
</p>

<title>Inanimate objects are conscious too</title>

<p>
	The distinction between inanimate objects and humans is imaginary. When the self fully collapses, it is impossible to distinguish yourself as a human from your carpet.
</p>

<p>
	THERE IS SUCH THING AS HUMANS! You're imagining it!
</p>

<p>
	When you understand this, this opens up interesting possibilities such as being a coffee table or a rock.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is a universal field. It does not belong to humans or even to creatures. Rather the universal field of consciousness imagines humans and creatures within itself. In the same way that you might carve a human body out of a block of ice. The ego/self is that carving out process which is constantly on-going. That is what we call survival. To survive as a self you must constantly keep chiseling the ice to maintain your identity. This you do by thinking and imaging yourself to be a real self. For this you use memories, stories, concepts, emotions, and a slew of defense mechanisms such as denial, projection, justification, self-bias, etc.
</p>

			In Norway the police are misusing theire power by taking your driving license if you even admit to smoke weed more than 2 times. You don't even have to be busted for it. We got this law which says that they can take the license from anyone they suspect don't have a sober enough lifestyle, and they themselves are the judge.. Doesn't matter if you haven't been near a car or not while high. If you tell your doctor you have used it, they are obligated to report you and you lose your license. This has started happening the last couple of years, used to be you just got a fine and that was it. I guess they have gotten more strict because there has been talk of decriminalisation and some people are very much against that. Some people thing its decriminalised here already, that is complete bullshit. They will make "decriminalisation" into forced medical supervision if you are caught with something.

		</p>

		<p>
			I kind of agree with you that sometimes you got to kill if pushed to the limits.
		</p>

		<p>
			What do you think about this?   How do you reconcile this difference? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can aim for that, but it is not possible in practice. Life cannot exist without death.
</p>

<p>
	This becomes especially problematic at the collective level. Even if you stop killing at the individual level, in collectives there will still be choices made which result in the loss of life.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, life is not only limited to human life. There is animal life, plant life, and even microscopic life.
</p>

<p>
	Your body has to kill bacteria by the thousands every day just for you to stay alive.
</p>

<p>
	This question of killing is a lot more complex than people think.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I don't recommend you kill humans. At an individual level you should be able to avoid it in decent parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
	But my point is, just because you avoid it doesn't mean you can now call others who do it evil. You must see why killing is necessary for some.
</p>

<p>
	As Neale said, nothing is good or bad.
</p>

<p>
	So I will no long bother explaining it to you. You must do the work. I spoil you with way too much explanation. It makes you weak and lazy.

<p>
	In the end, the only thing you will ever discover are deeper aspects of yourself. There is nothing but SELF here.
</p>

<p>
	But there are an enormous number of aspects of Self and degrees of comprehension of Self.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt that self-inquiry will be sufficient for most people to reach all those aspects and degrees.
</p>

<p>
	Healing and purifying the body & mind is important for most people I feel.
</p>

<p>
	Self-inquiry is great, but there is also more to this work than merely awakening.
</p>

<p>
	My approach to this work is extremely broad. Far broader than any orthodox teaching you'll find in Buddhism, Advaita, yoga, or any other school.

<p>
	Russia's a mix of Red, Blue, and even Orange.
</p>

<p>
	The reality of any country is far more complex than any one color. You have to consider specific regions, cities, peoples, and parts.
</p>

<p>
	The overall corruption problems, oligarchy, and Putin's totalitarianism is why I put it at Red.
</p>

<p>
	Culturally and religiously there is a lot of Blue. In the business sector there is some Orange but also lots of Red mafia style business.

But this physical world is not random.
</p>

<p>
	In a truly random world there would not be much interesting going on. Sure, God could imagine such a world, but so what? It's just one boring dream in the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	See, if you're a great writer, you don't write books of random letters. You could, but it's a waste of your time and genius. Maybe you do it once, but then you move on to greater things.
</p>

<p>
	You have the power right now to write a book of random letters. Ask yourself why you don't do it.
