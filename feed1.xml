<p>
	The older generations are not staying still. They too are evolving. Just not as fast as you whippersnappers would like.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, it's due to the rigidity of the mind. The mind is resistant to change. It's a fundamental survival mechanic.

Keep up your spiritual practices and don't get distracted by weird sensations. Weird sensations will arise and pass away. What you really want is to open that crown chakra and have an awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Educate yourself about Kundalini Awakening. Read some books about it. I have books on my book list about the ups and downs of the process.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13552-zambize/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13552" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13552-zambize/" rel="">@zambize</a> It's an average sociological trend. There are of course many individual exceptions. So don't stereotype people too much.
</p>

<p>
	The main reason it's true is because as the infrastructure of society evolves lower survival needs becomes easier and easier to satisfy to the point where you don't need to even think about them. Older generations had to worry about a neighboring tribe raping and pillaging their village. Modern generations don't have this worry because government infrastructure (like the modern court and police system) has been built to prevent that.
</p>

<p>
	Your value system reflects the environment you're trying to survive in. As the environment evolves, so must your values, beliefs, and worldview if you wish to be effective at survival.
</p>

<p>
	A slave owner would not be able to survival for long in today's environment. But 500 years ago it was almost the opposite. Owning slaves raised your survival. Because the environment was so different. Humans have changed their environment so much that slavery became counter-productive. Which is why today slavery is no longer considered acceptable.
</p>

<p>
	The moral of the story is: your values are totally contingent on your survival needs, which change constantly as evolution progresses. And the rate of progress is accelerating. So newer generations are more different than they were in the past.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Inner affects the outer.
</p>

<p>
	Outer affects the inner.
</p>

<p>
	Because inner = outer. In truth everything is one! So work on both, work on THE ONE.
</p>

<p>
	If you're surrounded by an unhealthy, toxic environment, change it ASAP. That will free you up to do serious inner work. And if you're stuck in an environment with no idea of how to break free, change your inner game, which will allow you to escape that environment.
</p>

<p>
	You can burn the candle from both ends.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there definitely are generational differences as each generation of humans gets indoctrinated into newer, more advanced cultural ways of thinking.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like with smartphones. Each new generation of smartphones comes with new, more advanced software. It is hard to install the latest software on old hardware, mostly due to rigidity of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	I'll have a video on this topic in the future.

<p>
	Yes, but be careful what you wish for. They will not only show you stuff you've been hiding, they will give you a glimpse of insanity.

<p>
	Mushrooms have a trickster like quality to them. They will play tricks on you and fuck with your sense of reality in crazy ways at higher dosages.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms tend to be extremely hypnotic. They will mesmerize you in ways you cannot imagine and words cannot explain.

</p>

<p>
	Martin Ball writes & talks about that phenomenon a lot.
</p>

<p>
	When that happens all you gotta do is just remember to open your body up and be more symmetrical. This will help you surrender and open up your mind to the wisdom it's trying to download.

</p>

<p>
	In another sense: enlightenment has no opposite because Truth has no opposite. Falsehood is not really opposite of Truth because Truth is all there is and falsehood isn't really a thing (it is an illusion).
</p>

<p>
	From the unenlightened perspective enlightenment has an opposite.
</p>

<p>
	From the enlightened perspective there never was such a thing as unenlightenment. Enlightenment is TOTAL and ever-present. It is the only thing that is ever occurring, has ever occurred, or can ever occur.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment or nonduality means: no dualities, which means no opposites.

<title>Trip Report - Atlantis Truffles</title>

You don't want the full power of mushrooms just yet. They can be scary powerful at higher doses.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone has a unique tolerance level. Next time just dose a bit higher.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful though because truffle potency can vary from batch to batch depending on the exact species and how they are grown. Dosing natural mushrooms is a bit tricky because they are not standardized. Ideally you would acquire a large batch, test its potency by doing a low dose, and then you would have a good idea of how potent your batch is. If you acquire small batches, you might eat too much of a potent batch based off a less potent batch.
</p>

<p>
	When I take mushrooms it is always a standardized alcohol extract, not actual mushrooms, which delivers a very consistent potency dose. You might even want to just take pure 4-HO-DMT (psilocin) in synthetic chemical form for the most precise dosing. Precise and consistent dosing is very important if you're getting into serious tripping.
</p>

<p>
	1 or 2 trips is NEVER enough to understand psychedelics. To really understand you must be ready to experiment with 10-30 trips. And even then, you're just seeing the tip of the iceberg of tripping. It takes about 10-30 trips to start to make sense of how they work because there are so many variables at play. No one trip means much by itself. You must accumulate aggregate experience. Even at precisely the same dose and under identical set & setting you will have wildly different trips. Because the mind is chaotic. It is not a simple machine like a refrigerator.

<title>Is mainstream shamanism legit? (Assuming you get a good shaman)</title>

<p>
	Shamanism is legit, but I don't think you understand what shamanism is. Most shamanism doesn't even involve psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	It is not so hard to teach yourself how to trip properly. Do more research, do more experimentation, follow proper protocol as has been laid out in my videos and from many other sources.
</p>

<p>
	DMT is not a good starting psychedelic. It's way too powerful, too visual, and too fast-acting. Start with something less intense, like 1g of mushrooms or 125ug of LSD. Gradually work your way upwards, taking time to contemplate and integrate insights. Trip moderately but consistently over the course of a year or two and you should master the art of tripping.

<p>
	What matters more than the substance is your intention when using it.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA, mushrooms, and Aya should all be real good for that.
</p>

<p>
	Give mushrooms a try. They can be healing in a twisted sort of way.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA is great for PTSD.
</p>

<p>
	Since you say you've done a fair amount of psychedelics already perhaps what you're missing in contemplation. Try doing contemplation using a journal on your issue. THEN follow that up with more psychedelics. That will orinet your trips in the right direction, yielding more clarity.

A lot. As they show you your authentic personality.
</p>

<p>
	1 trip is worth 100 videos.
</p>

<p>
	The problem of authenticity is so deep, it's not merely social or psychological, it's metaphysical. You can only really resolve the issue metaphysically. The ego is too terrified to really be authentic. It's a matter of life and death.
</p>

<p>
	Authenticity will only really come with the elimination of the ego. Which is not to say you can't or shouldn't do some self-help or psychological work. That can be useful. But it won't solve the root issue.

</p>

<p>
	If you struggle with dating you certainly won't learn how to get laid watching my videos.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, PUA/RSD is quite neurotic, dysfunctional, egotistical, ideological, and shallow.
</p>

<p>
	But it will get you laid if you take action on it. Which could be useful.

			I said to her that there are guys I know or I've heard of who had or currently still have more than one serious girlfriend and/or wife(s) and that all parties have been perfectly fine with each other.

<p>
	This is almost always a lie. Such situations are almost never stable and filled with self-deception on both sides. In practice what happens is the women are deeply unsatisfied and end up dropping out after a year or two. And it only works from the guy's POV if he's constantly pulling new women into his harem. The guy is burning through women every year to maintain his rotation. But because he's so selfish he's blind to the suffering he's causing these women so it seems fine from his POV, as least until he becomes more conscious, at which point he'll see it and probably stop.
</p>

<p>
	Most women will be crushed when you tell them that you want to see other women. Imagine utter heart-break. That's what she felt when you told her that. It crushed her. To pretend otherwise is quite delusional.
</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself why you want polyamory. Watch out for egoic self-deception here.
</p>

<p>
	Figure out how to relate to one woman first before you start juggling 3 of them at once.
</p>

<p>
	Most guys who want to be with multiple women are immature and terrified of commitment, relationship & intimacy. That's what you really want to work on.

They will be working on and enjoying their results.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be successful you need a serious business and marketing strategy. Dicking around on YT or a forum is not gonna cut it.
</p>

<p>
	You need to get very serious about your work. Stop dicking around and go create something that offers massive value to the world, and do it smartly. Passion is no substitute for poor business strategy.

<p>
	3 years is more than enough to time to learn that you don't like something. Clearly you ain't passionate about that.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to eat shit for a long time to know you're passionate about some subject.
</p>

<p>
	What do you enjoy studying? What kind of projects excite you?
</p>

<p>
	Formless Tao is unchanging.
</p>

<p>
	Formed Tao is ever-changing.
</p>

<p>
	Formless Tao and Formed Tao are identical. But they can also be distinguished.
</p>

<p>
	Again, changing vs unchanging is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Tao vs non-Tao is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Mundane vs True Tao is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Tao is ALL.
</p>

<p>
	Just...
</p>

<p>
	Tao

</p>

<p>
	It sounds like you just need to do a lot more contemplation, meditation, yoga, self-inquiry, and basic development work. LSD is a catalyst for all that.

	Pouring fuel on a fire only works if there is already a fire.

You gotta keep in mind that the stuff you learn from me is extremely advanced stuff that takes years and decades to put in place. I share a very big picture of your potential, the downside of which is that it can seem impossible to achieve, so far away.
</p>

<p>
	This is sort of the curse of a lofty vision.
</p>

<p>
	Baby steps man. You are still super young and your whole life is ahead of you. You have plenty of time to create a great life.
</p>

<p>
	Focus now on building a vision and cultivating hope. You want to enjoy the process of assembling your life. It's fun. Don't make it a grind.

</p>

<p>
	Don't worry, this is just the first step. You don't need to resolve all your answers and get breakthroughs in 1 or 2 trips. You should have the attitude that you will trip 20+ times and in that time you will figure a lot of stuff out and have many breakthroughs.
</p>

<p>
	Try to avoid distracting yourself in future trips. Stay away from electronics and note-taking devices. Allow yourself to go fully into the trip. Stop anchoring yourself to your old reality.
</p>

<p>
	Do not place a bunch of goals and expectations on a trip. Your #1 goal when tripping should be to go wherever the trip takes you. Drop all expectations or needing it to show you certain things. Deep insights will come organically. Just relax, surrender, and be ready to explore. Metaphysical curiosity is all you really need.
</p>

<p>
	When you trip, try not to move around so much. Sit still with eyes open, upright, fully alert -- like a meditation retreat.
</p>

<p>
	No, I don't consider infinite intelligence the Akashic Records. Akashic Records are supposed to be a database of the universe's entire history. Infinite intelligence is devoid of content. It is pure and formless. You will not find any historical memories or events in it.
</p>

<p>
	High doses of psychedelics are probably good for accessing the Records. I have yet to verify that.
</p>

<p>
	Or it might require some psychic talent. I'm not very psychic.

<p>
	I agree he shares some good wisdom and insights. Many cult leaders share valuable insights.
</p>

<p>
	I'm all for learning from multiple sources. Just don't join a cult.

<p>

Cults are often a mixture of both. It's a common mistake to assume that cults offer no valid spiritual insight. The issue is, spiritual insights via a video or book do not guarantee that the cult isn't a shit-show behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
	Case in point: Osho's commune. Osho was a good teacher but a terrible community leader.
</p>

<p>
	Saying advanced stuff into a camera is very easy compared to running a high consciousness community. Narcissistic cult leaders are often exceptionally good at speaking, bullshitting, and putting up fake fronts. That is their Zone of Genius. So you can't take appearances too seriously. Look at their actions rather than their words.
</p>

<p>
	If the community leader is taking on multiple wives or asking for six figure donations or has a criminal history -- that's a HUGE red flag.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is a set of special physical and energetic techniques for rewiring your nervous system. It is supposed to be much more powerful than meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is a bit like micro-dosing psychedelics.

Engineering work is usually pretty dry and routine.
</p>

<p>
	That's the major reason I switched my major from engineering to philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at more artist careers like creative writing, design, film-making, fine art, etc. That's where you can really flex your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I love the imaginative nature of game design or storytelling.

<p>
	In practice it's hard to help the world when you are underdeveloped and struggling to meet your basic needs.
</p>

<p>
	The point of developing yourself is so that you can become a better tool for helping uplift the world.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't wait to be perfect before you help the world. You can work on both simultaneously. Help out in whichever ways you're able. Don't bite off more than you can chew.
</p>

<p>
	The greatest thing you will ever do for the world is to awaken yourself.

<p>
	That isn't the issue. The issue is, are you capable enough, resourceful enough, to solve the problem of feeding yourself? The food itself is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	If you struggle to feed yourself that is a serious red flag. It shows a lack of development, resourcefulness, discipline, and self-efficacy.

<p>
	Very common.
</p>

<p>
	Do not trust young spiritual leaders to run solid communities. Running a spiritual community requires enormous development, ethics, experience, wisdom, and maturity. Spiritual communities quickly devolve into sex cults if the leader isn't masterful in his self-control, ethics, and emotions.
</p>

<p>
	You can almost guarantee that spiritual communities lead by 20-30 year olds will devolve very quickly. They have no idea the challenges.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment alone is nowhere near enough to run successful spiritual community.

Failure is part of the learning process.
</p>

<p>
	Now you have a bit of a better sense of how difficult it is to pull off a solid meditation retreat. Especially solo. Its takes super-human levels of self-discipline and dedication.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you have to build up to it. Just like you cannot will yourself to bench press 300 lbs. It takes many months of ramping up to that.
</p>

<p>
	The value of something like Kriya yoga is that you can do it for 1hr per day and it will gradually strengthen you over the course of a year in a way which you would never be able to achieve with a week-long hardcore retreat. The reality is that it takes time to rewire the mind and build tolerance for meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you need a lot more daily practice. It also helps a lot to hit a point in your practice where you actually enjoy meditation. It's very hard to pull off a retreat if you're secretly hoping it stops. The key is to surrender to the whole process and try to enjoy the silence, solitude, and peace. But that probably won't happen your first few retreats.
</p>

<p>
	Just keep practicing and doing as much as you can. Remember, it's not all about quantity. The quality of your practice is far more important than quantity. Quantity without quality will not yield much results.
</p>

<p>
	Also be patient. You are young. You don't need to be enlightened tomorrow. It's okay if it takes 5 years of practice. You will still be ahead of everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Precisely because you want to.

<p>
	Stop holding life purpose as something that NEEDS to be done. It's not about need, it's about desire to play a game.
</p>

<p>
	There's no need for Mario run across the screen and avoid turtle shells. But if you WANT, it can be a fun game. No one is forcing you to play Mario. If you would rather sit in your mother's basement and stare at the wall, go right ahead.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't want to do anything cool with your life, fine. Then be lame.

<p>
	There is no such thing as "a reality". Reality is entangled with one's nervous system. Such that every living creature has a different reality. If there is an infinite number of possible ways to configure a nervous system, there are an infinite number of different realities. For example, in some realities the color red does not exist because of how the nervous system is structured. In other realities it is not possible to know that 5+5=10 because of how the nervous system is structured. For example, a donkey cannot realize that 5+5=10. It cannot have that insight. But a human can. And not all humans. Only those with a proper nervous system. A mentally disabled person cannot realize that 5+5=10.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine all the experiences and insights you are unable to have simply because your nervous system does not grant you access to them. Your nervous system is like a filter through which infinity is boiled down to a narrow limited finite set of experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics alter your nervous system, allowing you to access experiences and insights that would otherwise be impossible. Which is why they're so uniquely useful for metaphysical work.
</p>

<p>
	But independent of all the above, there is the Absolute Truth, which you have access to if you are normal healthy human being.
</p>

<p>
	That's better than nothing. Nothing wrong with those. You can strategically use that motivation to build a lot of necessary infrastructure in your life. Then you can move on to higher things.
</p>

<p>
	Do not feel bad about meeting lower survival needs. They are necessary in most cases. You've got to climb Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. If the higher needs don't motivate you just yet that's probably because you're so under-developed in the lower ones.
</p>

<p>
	If you are in your early 20's you need to focus on learning basic survival skills. Learn how to feed yourself independently. Then worry about spirituality. If you are incapable of feeding yourself, you have no hope of attaining enlightenment or other advanced stuff like that.
</p>

<p>
	It is what it is. Work on developing yourself. It doesn't matter what is happening around you really.
</p>

<p>
	Take extreme ownership of your development. Stop expecting other people or your community to build you a staircase to heaven. Build your own staircase.
</p>

<p>
	With all the books, videos, and resources available so easily today via the internet you have no excuse not to be at Turquoise. If you don't achieve it it's only due to one reason: you're being lazy and irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
	You already have all the information. Why aren't you taking action? Why aren't you building a million dollar business? Why aren't you meditating 3 hours per day? Why aren't you working on your life purpose? Why aren't you developing powerful relationships? Why aren't you eating healthy? Why aren't you doing yoga? Why aren't you doing solo retreats?
</p>

<p>
	Laziness
</p>

<p>
	There is no cure for laziness but to get to work.

<p>
	Well, you could sit down, contemplate what those things are and realize they all fabrications of your mind.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is justice?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is law?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is order?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is good manners?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is the afterlife?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Don't you find it odd that you value these things so highly yet you've never really wondered what they are or where they came from? Or if they're even real?
</p>

<p>
	How can you truly value these things if you don't know what they are?
</p>

<p>
	A big part of transcending Blue is starting to think critically for yourself and question everything that your culture taught you. Become skeptical of everything. Every belief must be questioned to death.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's very valuable.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't become a devotee of any one teacher. Every teacher and teaching has blindspots.
</p>

<p>
	You must be capable of exploring a wide variety of perspectives and teachings or you will get trapped.

<p>
	Now you should be able to appreciate my Reality Is A Strange Loop video.
</p>

<p>
	More trips are required to answer the questions this trip of yours raised.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, mushroom trips can be quite twisted and difficult to make sense of. Other psychedelics like LSD or 5-MeO-DMT are clearer.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to escape thought loops is to change your state or physical location. Just going into a different room can be enough to break out of a bad thought loop, or going outside, or eating a snack, or turning on some silly music and dancing around for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta learn to shift your state. Meditation is also very helpful. If you're good at meditation you should be able to just silence the mind and its thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	And when all else fails: just SURRENDER
</p>

<title>How to do self inquiry? some questions</title>

<p>
	Self-inquiry is supposed to be a struggle. Of course you are doubtful and confused. That cannot be helped. The only thing that can ultimately clear up the confusion is awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You must do the inquiry and struggle through all the doubts and emotional issues which will inevitably arise.
</p>

<p>
	Awareness/emptiness isn't really felt, it is awared. We use the word "feeling" colloquially. Strictly speaking it is not a feeling. But feeling is much closer than thinking or imagining.

</p>

<p>
	Awareness is nothing. Nothing is not inner. It is omnipresent. It feels like its inner because that's what ego has done with it: appropriated it to construct a sense of self.
</p>

<p>
	As you do self inquiry that sense of emptiness will stop feeling like it is inside the head/body. It will spill out into the world.

Proof is always a second order thing. All proof is conceptual. Metaphysics is prior to proof.

<p>
	It is impossible, for example, to prove that you exist or that you were born.

<p>
	Yes, that is prrcisely what awakening and spirituality is about: seeing through all illusions as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	At first your ability to see through illusions is weak. With practice it becomes so strong that you finally see through the illusion of death, time, space, and physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, everything is an illusion.

			Life Purpose is about driving yourself to make an impact in the world. But this can only work if you are stuck in the illusion of control. In reality, you have no control whatsoever. As soon as you realise this (Enlightenment), driving yourself is no longer a possibility. As soon as you become aware of non-doership, you can no longer drive yourself to do anything, because you have no control over anything at all.

<p>
	Why are you making such groundless assumptions??
</p>

<p>
	Since there was no one in control to begin with, that means nothing is lost with enlightenment. No-control is not opposed to drive. Drive is done by the universe, not by the ego. The ego is just an offshoot of universal drive.
</p>

<p>
	After enlightenment your life purpose becomes a force of the universe -- just like it always was. Nothing changed. Only some egoic delusions of control were removed.
</p>

<p>
	You assume that life purpose is an egoic thing, but it does not have to be.

	In your Middle East example of course you want to understand the agendas of all sides. This doesn't mean they are all equal though. Those agendas can be categorized along Spiral.
