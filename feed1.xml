<p>
	Relationship and genuine communication is a skill. It needs to be trained and practiced.

<p>
	Make. Better. Friends.

<p>
	Dude, WTF is this sad victim thinking??
</p>

<p>
	I never drank once in my entire pickup career. Which means starting at zero experience.

<p>
	Stop spreading your limiting beliefs onto others.
</p>

<p>
	I swear, you guys on here have such terribly limited attitudes about women.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you've learned nothing about the core of what I teach: you cannot trust anything your mind says!

<p>
	What's embarassing is how easily you believe your own bullshit stories.

<title>The Controversial Guru Who Wants to 'Upgrade Civilization'</title>

</p>

<p>
	Your definiton of enlightenment is literally con-fused. You are conflating states of consciousness + stages of development + lines + types + morality + personal development + emotional awareness + the shadow + mastery.
</p>

<p>
	All of the above must be carefully distinguished from one another. Otherwise your definition of enlightenment becomes so grand that no human on Earth qulifies as enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is NOT moral perfection. Nor is it development. Nor is it emotional mastery. You will have to work on all of that post-enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is strictly only one narrow thing: direct consciousness of Absolute Truth. Nothing else.
</p>

<p>
	It is as though you are defining surgery as the cure to all ills and I am telling you that surgery will not cure all ills but you are insisting it must. This is a dangerous attitude because there will be many ills which surgery cannot cure, so you will then be forced to repress these ills in order for your definiton to be true. And so you will be sick without knowing why.
</p>

<p>
	Waking up does not cure you of dysfunctions which depend on the structure of your mind. Waking up merely detaches you from giving a fuck about the dream. Within the dream rules still apply to you. Hence why you will not be perfect, you can still be addicted to alcohol or rape a woman or own a slave. You can still be ignorant of relative truths and believe in false conspiracy theories. You can still fail to acknowledge the validity of other spiritual traditons. You can still have anger problems. Because all of this relates to the formed dream realm.
</p>

<p>
	The dream realm has importance. You cannot just neglect it unless you are okay will all hell breaking loose.
</p>

<p>
	That is precisely incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	What you call phenomena is actually Absolute Truth, not human perception, and it is not subjective. You think it subjective because you believe you are a human.
</p>

<p>
	Without ego, subjectivity gets recontextualized into the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	There never was subjectivity! It was an illusion.

When you go to a bar, practice being ruthless. When you are at the grocery store, practice being compassionate.
</p>

<p>
	Later you can bring the two together.

</p>

<p>
	Now just do that a couple hundred more times.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry, you will be amazed at how fast your skills improve.
</p>

<p>
	Do not be detered by rejection or awkard moments. Those are all totally normal and they don't matter. Get very used to girls rejecting you or ignoring you.
</p>

<p>
	Work on your body language, strong eye contact, commanding vocal tone, flirty smile, and plowing conservations without ejecting from set.
</p>

<p>
	Your conversations should be slightly sexually charged. Don't be talking to her like a gay friend. She needs to register within 5 minutes that if she gets in a room alone with you, you're gonna bang her. But do not verbalize sex. This is something she must pick up from your flirty manner and the way you look at her.
</p>

<p>
	Practice looking at her like you are a lion looking at a juicy gazelle. Get that chemistry going immediately upon approach. Don't be talking to her about work.
</p>

<p>
	Your goal should be to reach the hook-point in the set, where it is clear that she's attracted to you. It usually takes 0-5 minutes to hit the attraction hook-point. Attraction happens surprisingly fast.
</p>

You feel that way because your love and compassion is so weak.
</p>

<p>
	And don't confuse compassion with being a doormat or a lazy bum or a weak man.
</p>

<p>
	It's because life is ruthless that we practice love. A warrior must have heart. Love and consciousness is true strength.

If you are working on enlightenment then you must focus your inquiry on the present moment, not abstract philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not-knowing.

Do it sober.
</p>

<p>
	I did over 3000 approaches and never bought 1 alcoholic drink in my entire life.
</p>

<p>
	Try to stay away from canned openers. Just push yourself to approach and improvise gibber-jabber. Try to plow through and maintain the girl's attention for as long as possible. Do not eject. You keep talking to her until she tells you to fuck off or leaves. Plowing is key. That will build your conversation skills. You will suck a first, but you will also quickly improve if you make the commit to never eject from a set.
</p>

<p>
	Try to open to some sets and make them last for 30-60 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make your conversations logical. They can literally be any random useless nonsensical stuff, like how much you hate Trump or how much you love pizza. Talk, talk, talk your mouth off. Allow yourself to let loose and be emotional and opinionated. You can also make up fantastical shit like: "I'm going to buy everyone in this bar a kangaroo. Help me pick out a name for my kangaroo."
</p>

<p>
	Here's the key to night-game conversation: The words coming out of your mouth do not have to make any sense.

</p>

<p>
	Land on the Big Island can be surprisingly affordable. But construction costs and food costs, not so much.

Think of a list of what makes a woman high value to a man. What makes a woman a prize?
</p>

<p>
	Now step in the woman's shoes. What is a man's value to her? Make a list. Why would a woman need a man in here life at all? What makes a man a prize?
</p>

<p>
	Hint: these are NOT symmetrical! You must stop thinking about this using your dick. A beautiful face/body is not why a woman is looking for a man. Nor does she need a man with a long dick. She has much more important needs he must meet.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this from the woman's POV until you understand what needs a woman has. Then you will understand what value means here.
</p>

<p>
	A woman's value is much more physical. A man's value is much more social. A man who is weak, lazy, socially out of touch, and incapable of leading other men is the equivalent of an ugly woman.
</p>

<p>
	What makes a man ugly is NOT his physical appreance but his meek attitude. Which is exactly why incels can't get laid. It's not their looks, it's their ugly attitudes.
</p>

<p>
	You need to develop the attitude of a winner or a boss or a warrior.
</p>

<p>
	What do all girls fantasize about? A knight in shining armor who will sweep her off her feet and show her a whole new world. Looks are not what make a warrior.

</p>

<p>
	1) You are unwittingly assuming the validity of your skeptical stance, which itself is unknown. But you are taking it as known.
</p>

<p>
	You are also not questioning the validity of your thoughts and emotional reactions. So what even if skepticism is true and reality is not real? Why would that be bad or a problem? Since problems and value-judgments would also ve unreal? Why are you taking your emotions seriously? Doubt your emotions more!
</p>

<p>
	2) Solipsism is incorrect. Nonduality is like solipsism but also very different in important ways. It's not that other people are your subjective experience, it's that you are an illusion and therefore there is no such thing as subjective experience at all, there is only God or Being. Interaction with others continues as it always has because you are all people. What a person is simply gets recontextualized. A person is a hallucination in the mind of God, just like your person is.
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally your problem here is that your skepticism is not thorough enough. Ego has turned skepticism into a conceptual ideology, which is the opposite of enlightenment. The ego is not seriously undermining itself here. Your entire inquiry is coming from ego and assuming ego!
</p>

<p>
	You'd be closer to Truth if you just dropped all ideas and sat there looking at your hand, not knowing anything.
</p>

<p>
	Your inquiry is not properly grounded, it is too abstract and conceptual.
</p>

<p>
	Stop knowing things!
</p>

<p>
	Ground yourself in the actuality of the present moment. See my video: What Is Actuality?
</p>

<p>
	What you can do is meditate or do Kriya yoga. Shut that mind off. It is only digging itself deeper.
</p>

<title>Do I enjoy rejecting girls?</title>

Go approach those girls! They're not gonna do the work for you, and approaching is always uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
	The women in clubs are ordinary women. They aren't trash. That's your own mind making up bullshit excuses for why not to approach.
</p>

<p>
	Be very mindful of your self-talk in a club. Do NOT trust it! All of that is pure fear-based excuses.
</p>

<p>
	You will be amazed at the types of sweet and cool girls you'll meet in clubs. Clubs are not for whores or drunks. Ordinary girls go there. Girls are social creatures so they just get dragged along by their friends. If you approach enough girls you will be some great ones in bars and clubs. Girls in bars and clubs are not necessarily regulars. They might be there once a year for a birthday party or bachelorette party or for a work event.
</p>

<p>
	Before holding all these prejudices, go approach 1000 girls in clubs with an open mind. Then approach another 1000 girls in bars. Then approach another 200 girls at the mall. Then compare where the best girls come from based on your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If you go to clubs to enjoy dancing, what do you think the girls are doing? They enjoy dancing more than you! And yet you judge them for it. According to your twisted logic when you go to a club to enjoy dancing, you are not trash, you are better than everyone, but the girl is a trashy whore.
</p>

<p>
	If you're looking for a dog, go to the pet store.
</p>

<p>
	Frankly, with your rotten attitude you don't even deserve a trashy girl. Stop acting like you're too cool for school.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Pay very close attention to just what control is and how little of it you have. This doesn't just apply to people but all of life.
</p>

<p>
	This question of control is a very deep existential one. Notice how the ego keeps trying to control life but keeps failing and getting upset at itself for not having the control it wants.
</p>

<p>
	What is in control of you? Are you in control of yourself? Then why do you keep failing to control yourself? What is control? Why do you want control?
</p>

<p>
	Patiently contemplate all that.
</p>

	Ravers don't last. They crash and burn and turn to other drugs. Most raves don't even have real pure MDMA but other substitutes. And most ravers don't even know the difference.

</p>

<p>
	Which is why I do not talk about MDMA as a tool for consciousness work. It is not a true psychedelic, it is in a class of its own.
</p>

<p>
	Stick to LSD, mushrooms, and 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is the closest psychedelic to enlightenment. Nothing comes as close.

<title>Can you Get Girls That Are More Physically Attractive Than You?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31725-can-you-get-girls-that-are-more-physically-attractive-than-you/?do=findComment&amp;comment=371955</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I've attracted girls (8s, 9s, and even 10s) who were way more physically attractive than me.
</p>

<p>
	Because girls aren't primarily attracted by a guy's looks, but by his persona, charm, charisma, confidence, wit, leadership qualities, intellect, social status, and strength.
</p>

<p>
	If you go out a lot and approach a lot you will attract 8s and 9s fairly regularly. Which is not to say you'll be able to close all of them, because closing requires having perfect logistics, which usually isn't possible. So you will lose a lot of 8s and 9s, but at least you'll get the validation of having attracted them. You will be able to tell, for example, that if the logistics had been good, she would have eagerly slept with you. And from that point, it's only a matter of time until the logistics line up and you'll sleep with your first 8 or 9.
</p>

<p>
	10s are just so rare it's not even worth thinking about.
</p>

<p>
	All that's required is that you go out a lot, approach a lot, and have good game. If you can set up good logistics (by living very close to bars/clubs) that will up your chances of pulling girls by a factor of 2x-10x. Logistics are super important if you want to get laid a lot.
</p>

<p>
	Basically any girl that's an 8 or above is a model-quality girl, as she can make easy money off her looks, and often does or did so in the past. She can be a model, actress, stripper, pornstar, webcam girl, go-go dancer, hostess, etc. But don't forget, a lot of these girls can be annoying to deal with as they tend to spoiled rotten by men. These girls know how to use their looks to manipulate men. They know they are hot and they know the value of that in our society. Handling girls like that requires a serious boss/pimp attitude. A weak man cannot handle a girl like that.
</p>

<p>
	The rule of thumb is, whatever quality of girl you feel you deserve and can boss around, is the quality of girl you will get. Anything above that you will not be able to handle because your confidence is too low. Hot girls have high confidence. As a guy, in order to attract a girl your confidence and value must be higher than hers. If you want to date models, you need to develop balls of steel and a delusional, borderline narcissistic degree of self-confidence and self-love. You need to be unfazed and just have an I-don't-give-a-fuck attitude.
</p>

<p>
	Or become famous. Famous guys get hot girls easily.
</p>

<p>
	Because reality is a giant mind. There is no possibility of stuff unless it is occurring inside a mind.
</p>

<p>
	Here's the kicker: there actually is no difference between sentience/non-sentience, nonphysical/physical, conscious/unconscious, mental/non-mental. All of those are relative distinctions which collapse into one nameless unity. This unity is what is. It is pure Absolute Truth. Which is not different from something and nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is just one giant fat zero. Like it never even happened. Because there is no one to tell the difference between happening and non-happening. Another way to phrase it is... it seems to you that reality happened because you think it did.

<p>
	Calling it presence is extremely deceptive though.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone thinks they have presence so they don't think they're missing anything.
</p>

<p>
	Whereas with God, it's clear to most people that they are missing an experience of God.
</p>

<p>
	Take someone like Sam Harris. He has meditated for years, he even has some degree of awakening to no-self, and he would readily agree with you about presence, but he is not conscious of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	Presence or awareness are way too neutral of terms. These terms actually make many Buddhists believe there is no God.

<p>
	The answer is to tread carefully and not build cult-like organizational structures and to stress an integral, dogma-free approach.
</p>

<p>
	The answer is also to not get ahead of your skiis, to maintain high personal integrity and to not lust after power, sex, money, fame, or success.
</p>

<p>
	The answer is to do shadow work even after awakening and to be sensitive to the collateral damage you cause. And to not go on a crusade.

Just look at the yin-yang image. It's both nondual and dual at the same times because it depends on how you want to look at it.
</p>

<p>
	Free will vs not-free-will is a duality which collapses when you're in nondual consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can tap into the infinite creativity of God, since you are him. But that does not necessary mean you can create mountains out of thin air.

<title>mixing Vippassana and Self Inquiry</title>

</p>

<p>
	I had my first mystical experience doing just that: Vipassana followed by self-inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	I find self-inquiry not to be effective unless one's mind is already in the zone and highly mindful. So, for example, I find it bad practice to being a meditation retreat with self-inquiry because the mind is not focused enough yet to have any breakthrough. So my retreats begin with lots of Vipassana. The self-inquiry is best saved towards the end.
</p>

<p>
	Vipassana is sorta like sharping the knife and self-inquiry is more like using it to slit the throat. Without Vipassana you've got a butter knife.

<title>Will girls not have sex outside of a relationship in hgihschool?</title>

<p>
	A "relationship" in high school is a rather fickle notion. More like a 2-week affair.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you're not gonna be doing one-night stands or same night lays in high school. You gotta build up to it through friendship in a way that you wouldn't need to do if you're hunting for girls at a bar or club.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see why you'd even want that in high school. Just get yourself a girlfriend. You don't need to sleep around with your entire class. If you're gonna be having sex with a girl in high school your intent should be to be in a relationship with her. Why you making it such a big chore? Relationships are fun. A relationship (in high school) is not marriage. It's a flimsy thing.

<p>
	This is a very dangerous misconception. By equating enlightenment with moral perfection and an impossiblity of shadow, you set yourself up to be a great Zen Devil, full of much shadow. Because once your enlightenment happens, you'll still have a TON of shadow issues left unresolved, but your fantasy of perfection will force you to deny this fact and so you will suppress these shadow issues even deeper, doubling the size of your shadow and become a half-enlightened devil.
</p>

<p>
	Even the greatest most enlightened masters have shadows and pathologies.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be a fool. Nothing in this work is automatic.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea what imperfections Ramana Maharshi had. You just have a fantasy of him in your mind. It's easy to appear to have no imperfections when living one's entire life in a cave. The real test comes when you live an active life, where you have leadership obligations, duties, money, fame, sex, luxury, family, children, business, politics, and other things to deal with. When a hot girl with big tits comes and rubs them on you, let's see how long your enlightenment lasts.

But Orange is dangerous enough as it is. And when those 60% Blue evolve into Orange, that will be a big problem as Orange will run hog-wild. That could easily end humanity.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if all of Africa, South America, Middle East, and Asia became Orange! That's pretty scary. And you know it's coming unless we kill ourselves even sooner.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I'm not worried about Green. We need a thousand times more Green to balance out all the Orange that's yet to come.

<p>
	It is precisely what it wants to be.

<p>
	Nonduality requires nothing outside itself to define it. It exists without non-existence. It is light without dark. Nonduality has no opposite.
</p>

<p>
	You are still thinking of nonduality dualistically.

</p>

<p>
	If life is suffering, what is it when you are not suffering?
</p>

<p>
	Are you suffering right this moment?
</p>

<p>
	Yet the moment still is.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to over-generalize and call everything suffering. That chair is not suffering, for example.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that there are many times throughout the day when you are not suffering. Which shows you that your perspective is not totally right.

<p>
	60%+ of the world population is at Blue or below. So I'd be more worried about that and Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Much of Green radicalism is actually a reaction against the stubbornness of Orange from evolving into Green.
</p>

<p>
	If Orange took environmental issues and income inequality seriously, then there would be much less incentive for Green radicals.

<p>
	Infinity does not necessarily work the way your mind imagines.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is infinitely intelligent because it has unlimited power. In short, there is nothing to stop from being infinitely intelligent, so it is!
</p>

<p>
	What you must understand is that there are no constraints on reality as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not random, arbitrary, or chaotic. It is fine-tuned by an infinite intellect which cannot ever be fully articulated, but you can become conscious that this is so.

	If you were me, you'd be sitting here typing this sentence with no sense of being you. Since to be me is to be fully me, not you.
</p>

<p>
	What it means to be you is to not see through anyone else's eyes but your own.
</p>

<p>
	If you were able to see through my eyes, you'd be me! Which is precisely what I am: you looking through my eyes! And you are me looking through your eyes.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	This is possible precisely because the perceiver (True Self) is nothing.

	Or he builds a cult which goes off the rails and drives many people into delusion.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to take into account about every organization is how it plays out after the leader is dead. How much evil will it spread? If the leader enlightens 1000 people in his lifetime but leaves an organization which enslaves and brainwashes 100,000, it's not longer clear that it was a net positive.
</p>

<p>
	Is the Catholic church a net positive or net negative? Hard to say. The math is very complex in that equation. Jesus might be rolling in his grave.

Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, Muhammad, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's no accident that such people are revered as gods among men. And serve a role models for millions. Because to truly pull off such a thing requires you become god-like.
</p>

<p>
	In practice no leader is perfect. Many of them have secret hidden shadow sides which you don't see in public.
</p>

<p>
	For example Gandhi was an amazing leader but not without some personal shadow issues. Same with Martin Luther King Jr.
</p>

<p>
	Also take note how many of these leaders were killed by the ignorant hoards. That should tell you something.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I find Gandhi very inspiring. He gave up his whole life for his mission.

If thats it then also those old Tibetan Monks or anyone/anything from past history, which we have not seen, did probably not exist and is only made up from this dream?
		</p>

		<p>
			Because if they existed, then this dream has been going on for millions of years continously having experienced so many different lifeforms since the first cell, and that would not be meaningless then and also if it has been going on for millions of years then probably we experience this dream againn in another ego and that is there comes up the question in what ego and where on this planet are we going to experience it again?
		</p>

		<p>
			And if there are infinite amount of other dreams, then what determines in which one our special feeling ego is going to appear again, which factors? There is no ego? But there must be because I am experiencing one, what happens after death is mysterious, hopefully I'll find out having a beautiful 5 Meo DMT experience too, but for now I am curious and hope this sparks a healthy conversation here

<p>
	This is too deep a topic to get into here. If you want to discuss that, start a new thread about it.
</p>

<p>
	For now what I'll say it this: you can spend decades reading various scriptures and various claims by monks and yogis. But all of it will be hearsay and you will have no clue if what they are saying is true or not. You must ground this work in your own direct experience. Are there aliens? Are there past lives? Is there karma? Is there an escape from rebirth? Is there a God? Are there angels? -- the truth is you don't know until such time you are directly experiencing it. So rather than speculating about this stuff, invest your time having direct experience of the things you speak of.
</p>

<p>
	Try this rule on for the next week: Do not speak of anything you have not directly experienced. Have you experienced a kangaroo? Then don't speak of it. Have you experienced being gay? Then don't speak of it. Have you experienced outer space? Then don't speak of it. Notice how this one rule cuts out a lot of bullshit from your mind. This is called being grounded. You must constantly reground yourself in this work because the tendency is to float off into metaphysical speculations, and then even worse, debate over those metaphysical speculations.
</p>

<p>
	If you really wish to honor the monks and yogis of the past then devote more time to meditation, contemplation, yoga, and psychedelics. That is the only way to validate the things they said.
</p>

<p>
	Next time it happens contemplate: Why is this happening? What is the point of this? Why am I creating this reaction?
</p>

<p>
	Don't ask us. Ask yourself.

He seems quite culty (although also genuinely enlightened). Not much new under the sun.
</p>

<p>
	Pathological enlightenment is much more common than people assume.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, watch out for young gurus especially. They are prone to be Zen Devils.
</p>

<p>
	Upgrading society is good. The problem is, it's much harder to do than almost anyone realizes. Good intentions, pleasant words, and even enlightenment is not enough. It takes conscious leadership and a degree of self-mastery which very few people have.
</p>

<title>Huge depressive episode triggered by &quot;what is god&quot; video</title>

</p>

<p>
	The ego is incredibly strong and it will not allow you get rid of meaning so easily. If only it were so easy!
</p>

<p>
	It is a fact that no meaning whatsoever exists. This fact is very threatening to your way of life and your survival program. Which is why you are reacting with all those emotions. Those emotions are designed to get you back on track with your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	The fact that life is meaningless is itself meaningless, hence it is not bad or depressing.
</p>

<p>
	In order to be depressed you must assign negative meaning to life. So ironically the reason you're feeling so bad is because you are trapped inside an illusory world of (negative) meaning.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move is to surrender all meaning. But ego is not gonna let that happen without a huge stink.
</p>

<p>
	In a few days you will forget you ever watched that video and you will fall back asleep into your unconscious life, as though nothing ever happened. That's how sneaky the ego is. It will just sweep all this truth under the rug, out of your awareness.
</p>

<p>
	What you should be really worried about is falling back asleep, not losing meaning.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, ancient man was selfish, barbaric, and vicious like a wild dog.
</p>

<p>
	The end of slavery is a modern evolutionary advance.
</p>

<p>
	You have to consider the bigger picture. Consciousness not only has depth but breathed. God could go really deep by creating 5 enlightened masters or go very broad by creating 50,000 idoits hanging out on Facebook. Those 50,000 idiots might amount to more consciousness in the long run because they will breed like rabbits and share a technology like 5-MeO-DMT which then leads to 50,000 awakenings rather than just 5.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is highly nonlinear and counter-intuitive. Evolution is not a straightforward afair. What looks like steps backward are actually necessary steps forward. Therein lies the genius of the overall design. It's like a queen sacrifice in a masterful chess game.
</p>

<p>
	To understand God's plan you must look an infinite number of moves ahead.

</p>

<p>
	Just observe more rather than speculate.
</p>

<p>
	Sit down and observe what resistance is, how it works, when it arises, why it arises, when it passes, why it passes, what function is serves, what it feels like, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Those are all great questions.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of contemplation is not deconstruction per se but to get to the truth of the matter, to see what is actually the case.
</p>

<p>
	What is actually the case about resistance? To answer that you must spend a lot of time observing it. The mistake is speculating about it based on your assumptions and theories. Stop doing that! Rather, observe it from scratch and make mental note of what you see.
</p>

<p>
	Study it like a rare tropical butterfly under a microscope which you are seeing for the first time in your life.
</p>

	And modern science still has no clue what gravity really is, even at the conceptual level.

<p>
	In fact, science does not know what anything is. ANYTHING!

</p>

<p>
	Get enlightened, realize God, and go about your life or leave this plane. I don't care. There's no need to debate it with me.
</p>

<p>
	If your intention is to leave this plane, then get on with it. No need to convince us of anything, no need to talk about nirvana on an online forum.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to lessen your karma, begin by letting go of debating differences between Buddhism and Hinduism.

	Basically correct. Except I still detect subtle duality in his descriptions. It sounds like he has not accessed total nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Still, pretty good for a nerdy scientist type.
</p>

<p>
	This kind of stuff is the future of science, philosophy, and cosmology.
</p>

<p>
	But just the fact that this guy is bragging about his IQ score already makes him not the smartest guy in the world.
</p>

<p>
	If he was a genius he should have known that mankind has understood the Absolute Truth for at least 5000 years before him.

<p>
	I was listening to an obscure podcast about psychedelics. One of the guests (I think it was Martin Ball) mentioned that 5-MeO-DMT creates total loss of ego. As soon as I heard that, I immediately knew this was the most important psychedelic to try.
</p>

<p>
	After I read some Reddit reports of people not liking 5-MeO-DMT because it was too much of a mindfuck and not fun, my conviction doubled. This was clearly the most important psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is very easy to suss out: it always lies behind a curtain of fear.

<p>
	Yes, it's not permanent. But that does not make it any less true.
</p>

<p>
	It is precisely what it promises: total enlightenment for 60 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	To say that it is somehow not "real" enlightenment because it only lasts 60 minutes is a mistake. That's a judgment your ego is making. It is simply a fact that you can have an enlightenment which lasts 60 minutes. Careful with how you judge that.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru holds a week-long retreat which is specifically designed to give participants a short glimpse of enlightenment using yogic techniques. This is a peak experience of God which passes. Yet it is still valid and valuable, otherwise why would he hold such a retreat?
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is just a more efficient way of doing exactly that. It doesn't require a week, and it will take you deeper than a week-long retreat ever could.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to define the word "enlightenment" to only apply to permanent awakening, you can do that. But then you still have to allow that God can be fully realized non-permanently for 60 minutes. Realizing the Truth is independent of time or permanence. Whether it lasts for 10 seconds or 100 years, Truth is Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Confusion is created when people insist that there is only one right way to access Truth (their way). In fact, there are hundreds of ways to access Truth. Each come with their own pros and cons. The chief con of yoga is that it takes YEARS to deliver God realization. It takes so long that 95% of practitioners will quit before they get there. 5-MeO-DMT addresses this problem beautifully.

	Makes sense given how he said in the Joe Rogan podcast at the end that it's all about love.
</p>

<p>
	That was clearly a psychedelic insight. A typical engineer would not understand such things without psychedelic assistance.

</p>

<p>
	Best to cycle it on and off, using it when it really counts.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate solution is to develop yours consciousness to that state naturally through stuff like Kriya yoga. If you like Modafininil you will like Kriya yoga.

<p>
	You must do it at the right time. If you fully open up to her before you have sex with her, then that would be a mistake. There are different phases of dating and relationships. You must time things properly. For the first few months, keep things light otherwise you might come off too needy.
</p>

<p>
	Don't go sharing the skeletons in your closet on your first date.

That's selfishness, fear, and neediness. You are projecting your own selfishness and fear onto others.
</p>

<p>
	The correct attitude is to give your love freely, without expectation of return. True love is not about getting, true love is about giving.
</p>

<p>
	True love requires enormous courage and groundedness. Which requires that you grow and mature as a man. You have to be willing to experience loss, heartbreak, and rejection.
</p>

<p>
	Hint: you could die at any time. Why aren't to scared of death every day you wake up? Life could leave you at any time.

<title>I struggle with day game</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4543-marinus/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="4543" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4543-marinus/" rel="">@Marinus</a> That's great action-taking. 31 daytime approaches is a lot.
</p>

<p>
	There are many stages to a successful pickup that must be mastered: the open, body language, the smile, eye contact, keeping conversations going, flirtation, kino/touching, authenticity, sexual tension, hitting a hook point, screening for boyfriend, getting the close, leading and pulling for instant date, number closing, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's quite hard to learn all those on your own. It helps to go with a wing-man who already has experience with this and can help you evaluate your interactions. Try to find some wings in your city.
</p>

<p>
	A successful daytime approach requires a lot more than just opening the girl and saying Hi. You must learn to make the conversation fun, flirty, and interesting. And you must learn how to close in order to get any results. All daytime approaches must end with you asking the girl for an insta-date coffee.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you will be very awkward and mechanical at first. But you can quickly improve. Your goal should be to approach a girl in the same way you might approach and talk to your own girlfriend. It has to be very natural, like it's no big deal, like you've known her your own life. You must just assume this vibe and sense of friendship and familiarity right off the bat. It has to be super casual so the girl is not put on guard.
</p>

<p>
	A great way to practice conversation skills and body language is by chatting with store clerks at the mall. Go find some girl clerks. They are bored most the day and will be happy to talk with you. Try to flirt with them a bit without outright hitting on them. Try to get them to open up about themselves. Try to charm them a bit. Tease them. Wink and smile at them. Tell them some stories about yourself, etc.
</p>

<p>
	At this point your goal is not even to have sex but simply to become a more social, extroverted, talkative, charismatic person. You can even practice on guys and old ladies. Get good at small-talk and self-expression to strangers. Get good at building rapid social comfort, so people are comfortable around you. So they feel you as a fun friendly guy.
</p>

<p>
	I love day game. The biggest problem with it is that it's not easy to find a lot of hot girls during the day unless you live near certain great locations. Cities like LA, London, and NYC are amazing for daygame, but most cities aren't.
</p>

<p>
	The advantage of night is that you get a lot more girls to talk to. And there's possibilities for same night pulls.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, it's also VERY IMPORTANT that when you approach a girl during the day you stop her and face up to her squarely, face to face. Do not be approaching girls from the back or the side. If she is walking, you must stop her cold by getting her attention. You must face her directly. You must have her full attention before you deliver your opener. Do not be whispering your opener to her side or back as she is walking. Run around her and stop her without scaring her. And you must always open with a smile. If there is a look of fear on your face, she will freak out. Practice that smile like your life depends on it.
</p>

<title>Could a stage blue person regress To red if they realised good and bad dont exist?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31569-could-a-stage-blue-person-regress-to-red-if-they-realised-good-and-bad-dont-exist/?do=findComment&amp;comment=369835</link>

<p>
	Tis always possible to misconceive a stage and improperly apply advice.
</p>

<p>
	But most Blue people would just reject stage Green (relativism) rather than devolving into Red. So I wouldn't worry too much about devolving people merely by getting them to contemplate relativism.
</p>

<p>
	The transition out of stage Blue often feels like death, loss of faith, or the collapse of one's reality. Because stage Blue is so addicted to its rigid ideology and morals. To them it feels like their whole world is collapsing into nihilism. This is all just exaggeration and illusion, but it feels real to them nonetheless. Which is why its so hard to evolve people out of Blue. They are stubborn like mules and they will bite a helping hand. They will act aggressively ignorant.
</p>

<p>
	But it's worth trying. It's a good learning experience for you as a teacher to see how far you can push them.
</p>

<p>
	If you are teaching children, they can be quite openminded to radical ideas. But their parents might make a stink that you are corrupting the youth with your socialist post-modernist agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds dysfunctional and immature. Just because you've got some low-esteem girl on the hook doesn't really say much. If you wanted, you could actually grow yourself into doing a serious loving relationship. But that would mean really growing yourself and facing your fears of commitment, intimacy, honesty, etc.

<p>
	If you are equating The Shadow with stage Red, that's a very dangerous equation. Since shadow is also commonly present at Blue, Orange, Green, and even above.
</p>

<p>
	Every stage tends to have its own shadow: those aspects which you deny, repress, and project.
</p>

<p>
	Integrating Red is important, but it's not the only aspect of shadow work. Green shadows are very popular these days among stage Blue and Orange peeps.
