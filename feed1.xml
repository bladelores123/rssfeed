			I value everyone's opinion and this forum is brilliant...however...I don't agree with you Leo....sorry...We all have our opinions.. You see, given a choice.... who would you trust..... me...or God? All these discussions ultimately come down a  simple question in my opinion... whether we believe in God or not. If the spirit is regenerated there is the understanding that we become part of God....yes. This must not be confused with the thought that we are God however.

<p>
	No, you're not getting it. Sorry.
</p>

<p>
	You are stuck in denial. Because you lack the necessary direct experience that you are God.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing short of a massive awakening can fix that.

And also what God is.
</p>

<p>
	These are deeper, more advanced kinds of awakening which require a lot of purification and profound levels of contemplation and questioning. And ultimately a state change is required. You cannot access God from your current state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You are on the right track, you just have to go much deeper.

			From my understanding, although this stuff is difficult to get your head around....we are not God. We have a body...we have a soul (the YOU)... and we can have a regenerated spirit (The i am). God is spirit ...and he alone can regenerate our spirit. This is where the re-connection with God comes in. The spirit is separate to the Soul and the physical body.

<p>
	But many health issues have to do with lack of consciousness, lying, self-hatred, fear, emotional blockages, false worldviews, overthinking, stress, emotional abuse, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Anything which can help elevate consciousness can help with healing too.
</p>

<p>
	Many people have healed themselves with psychedelics. To ignore or deny the healing properties of psychedelics is to rob many people of a life-saving tool.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening and healing go hand in hand because most health issues result from corrupt consciousness.

<p>
	The debates were pretty good this election cycle. There were so many of them that lots of issues got covered and things were pretty clearly laid out. There's no confusing who stands for what unless you didn't watch them.
</p>

<p>
	A debate with 10 people cannot ever be deep. The format has its limits and must work within that. No one is going to watch a 5 hour debate about technical policy details.
</p>

<p>
	Stop expecting some sort of perfection from democracy. It's a system. It is what it is. It's working okay. Constantly bashing it isn't a solution.

<title>Can Trump winning again would help the progressive movement more than having Biden? </title>

<p>
	Nah, too much 3 dimensional chess. A Trump win should be avoided as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Biden is not as bad as progressives make him out to be. He would still move the country forward.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, much of the stuff Bernie wants to pass would never pass the Congress anyway.
</p>

<p>
	Will Biden dismantle the whole capitalism neoliberal system? Hell no, but that's not gonna happen even under Bernie. That system is way too entrenched and people are not ready to give it up.
</p>

<p>
	We gotta take small wins.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump gets a 2nd term he will appoint 2 far right Supreme Court justices which will be a horrible blow for generations to come. That alone makes Biden worthwhile. Trump can do things in the 2nd term which will take generations to undo. So it's a poor move to try to help progressives by not voting for Biden. You will live to regret that. If Biden beats Bernie, accept it and vote for Biden vs Trump with the same enthusiasm you would have had for Bernie vs Trump. Never take for granted how much worse things could be than Biden.

			If I had to posit a guess, it would be because cubism, expressionism etc. was a reaction of the stuffy formalism of the stage Blue society it came form, and was used to express things like individualism, self-identity, one's own passion, the absurdity of excessive formalism such that was found in classical art, and so on. It's not really Green because it's not expressing feelings of love, humanity, ecology, etc and its not Turquoise because it wasn't really about mystical insights and oneness, although it may have had some Green elements to it.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a good explanation.
</p>

<p>
	If you studied art history you know most of Western art since Christ was about religious propaganda and displays of civilizational power. Portraits of kings, etc. That was stage Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Then came Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Picasso, Abstract Expressionism, Andy Warhol, etc. which threw that stage Blue paradigm in the trash in favor of individualistic artistic expression, materialism, breaking conventions, etc. Stage Green didn't really exist back then.

	Also, don't reduce my teachings down to such simple-minded black vs white drivel. I gave you lots of nuance which you don't want to hear.

	That's why you're the student and not the teacher.

<p>
	This work is very nuanced and tricky. It's best to stay humble until you get your legs before you go criticizing. Criticizism doesn't bother me. The problem is your criticism comes from a deep lack of experience and expertise, so it's largely a waste of time. Nothing personal. But you are just using all this criticism to avoid doing the actual work within yourself.

<p>
	Absolutely not.
</p>

<p>
	Only you baby. There's nothing in the universe but you.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't confuse God from some image or idea. Images and ideas will always come short of God itself.
</p>

<p>
	If you ever encounter something you think is other than God, expand your notion of God until it includes that thing. Ad infinitium. That is the true God.

	Small dose, no problem.
</p>

<p>
	It's very hard to go wrong with a small dose.
</p>

<p>
	1g mushrooms
</p>

<p>
	120ug LSD
</p>

<p>
	Etc. You will be fine.
</p>

<p>
	People screw up by taking massive doses. Imagine if you drank a whole bottle of vodka. That's how people screw up.

You said each awakening is deeper than the last and that there is no bottom right? So what’s the point of trying to get to the bottom? I feel like you could ease the pedal and stop compressing your development. You could develop other aspects of yourself like your physical body with ashtanga yoga since ultimately everything is being transmitted through your body. Make the antenna more durable. Slow down the pace of the psychedelic use and integrate over a period of 10 years rather than 2. Ultimately you are still in a limited human form, perhaps you should embrace it.

<title>Does Spiral Dynamics debunk historical materialism?</title>

<p>
	The material IS the spiritual, just in unrecognized form.
</p>

<p>
	SD and historical materialism both point at the same thing: most people need to meet their basic needs before they can evolve higher. Material needs like food, clean water, shelter, schools, police, healthcare, decent neighborhoods, decent courts, roads, and other infrastructure is crucial for further evolution.
</p>

<p>
	The sooner you satisfy the material, the sooner you can transcend it to the spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	It makes no sense to ask someone to meditate when he is being chased by the mafia or his children have no school to go to.
</p>

<p>
	Historical materialism is correct, but it fails to properly account for the highest levels of evolution which occur once the material needs are all met. Historical materialism reaches stage Green and cannot see above that to Tier 2. That's why SD is more powerful. It accounts for higher levels.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You are not merely a thought of God. You are God. Full on, with zero qualifications.
</p>

<p>
	You are everything that has every occurred or could ever occur. You are your creation.
</p>

<p>
	You will never be able understand it using your current mind. Seek full awakening and all your questions will be answered. You will know how you created the whole Universe. No questions will remain. You will have absolute self-awareness.

</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not reached by dabblers. You underestimate how serious this work is.
</p>

<p>
	Serious spirituality is not without risks. You have to want it more than you want to live. Which explains why it is rare.

</p>

<p>
	Keep going deeper. You've only just begun. Don't increase your dose. Just do more trips and contemplate the shit out of each one until clarity is reached. Each trip will thus take you deeper and deeper. Until one day you reach total realization of yourself as God: creator of the Universe.

<title>Afraid of bad trips</title>

<p>
	Many of my trips are so good that's what maked them so challenging.
</p>

<p>
	You'll understamd once you have a breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all fear is an illusion. Once you realize that, that makes tripping easier.
</p>

<p>
	The fear is just those aspects of the ego-self which require purification, until one day you transcend all fear and enter Paradise.
</p>

<p>
	Total awakening is the complete absence of fear because you are so conscious that you see all things as yourself, and God cannot fear itself. It makes no sense to fear Love.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is what keeps you locked in ego, seperated from God's Love.

<p>
	When you realize you are God, you also realize everyone is God, but you also realize that they have no clue that they are God and your heart breaks at the thought of how to communicate it to them such that they could realize it.
</p>

<p>
	The tragedy of God is that it's so good it is denied by almost all precisely because it sounds too good to be true. Yet it is nothing but Absolute Truth. How could Absolute Truth be denied? The mind finds a million ways.

			Gotta disagree here. Poll after poll has shown, that when people are asked about which issues they support, they overwhelmingly come out in favor of the so-called ´progressive´ agenda: Universal health care, gun control, no endless wars, legalizing marijuana, etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But that's not how people vote. People do not vote on policy, they vote using their gut which follows their level of development. People vote based on the candidates personality and vibe more than policy.
</p>

<p>
	On paper, yes, people like many progressive policies, but they are also scared of change and they vote like sheep in a herd. They do not carefully evaluate things and they are not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to make Green happen.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to say you want Med4All in a poll. It's a lot harder when you realize your taxes might go up, and you might have to sacrifice your current doctor to make it happen, and you might have to vote against your own family, friends, and church group.
</p>

<p>
	It's like if you polled people in Iraq whether they want to live in a rich democractic country. They would all say yes. But when you tell them they have to surrender fundamentalist Islam and clan warfare and petty corruption, they will not be able to do it because they haven't developed that high yet. Good stuff comes at a cost. It isn't free. If you want to live in a democracy there are certain sacrifices that must be made, like tolerating your neighbhor who has a different religion than you. Or not killing gays for being gay. You'd think such sacrifices are not a big deal, but they are a big deal to many traditional people. People are scared of change. People are scared of selflessness. Most people treats politics and life as an arms race, looking to gain the most advantage for themselves rather than doing what is best for the collective. People's fear , hate, and selfishness overpowers their love, hope, and selflessness. It's easy to say you want love, but will you actually follow through when your survival is threatened? Will you lay down your fear and judgment? Most won't. People want love but aren't willing to pay the cost to get it.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck convincing a mother of 3 who works in accounting for the health insurance industry to support Med4All when it means that she will likely lose her job and her kids will not get the toys they want for Xmas.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just evil corporations at work here. The "evil corporations" are supported by many middle class folks because it pays their bills. "The establishment" is made out of ordinary citizens, not some special race of evil reptile people.
</p>

<p>
	How do you convince ordinary citizens to sacrifice for the greater good? << That is the root problem here.
</p>

<p>
	And also, how do you get them to stop thinking and acting like herd animals? In a herd, even if one sheep develops a mind of its own, very soon it will be peer pressured by the herd to fall back in line. The herd feels comfy with Biden. Policies be damned.

<p>
	It's not rigged against Bernie, the majority of the country is simply not educated or developed enough to vote for Green.
</p>

<p>
	In a democracy, not the best candidates wins, but the one who best matches the development level of the people. That what we're seeing. That's also why Trump won.
</p>

<p>
	The simple fact is, Americans are pretty damn ignorant, so you shouldn't expect them to all of the sudden elect amazing people. That has never been the case.
</p>

<p>
	What Bernie supporters and progrrssives need to understand is that they are in a bubble. The majority of the Americans are not progressive, they are moderate. "The establishment" is not just the corporations, media, and Washington, it is most of the citizens as well. The media is establishment precisely because that's what most people pay to watch, not because the media is somehow overriding the will of the people. The will of the people is just not very bright and the media reflects that. The establishment IS the people. That's what progessives are in denial about.
</p>

<p>
	I see a lot of progressives in denial about thier own biases, projecting their progressive bias on the media and estblaishment. When a progressive calls the media biased, the truth is, the progressive is biased but cannot see it, so the only option is to blame the media.
</p>

<p>
	Joe Biden didn't win because of a rigged media. He won because that's where most people are at. And that's a very difficult thing for progressives to admit. Progressives need to admit that most people are not progrssives. This is a more realistic starting point rather than assuming that a majority of people are progressives but some evil "establishment" is holding them back. That gets into fantastical conspiracy theory territory which fails to properly identify the problem and take responsibility for it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really see Bernie winning it now. Most of the country is still not developed enough to see Bernie's appeal, hence Biden is what a majority can agree on.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that most of the US is not a solid stage Green. So it's really hard for solid Green to get elected.
</p>

<p>
	Before someone like Bernie can win, voters have to grow up (or die). Most would rather die than grow up. So here we are.

			Any form of DMT is hard to get around here, so I did a semi-research and saw that people were extracting it from it. Its a weed so abundant and all over the world.<br />

<p>
	You are not going to be able to extract 5-MeO-DMT from grass. N,N-DMT maybe, if you're a good chemist with equipment.
</p>

<p>
	Not worth it. Much easier to get synthetic.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You can use a volcano like device or even create your own vape pen carts. Just avoid toxic oils that will ruin your lungs. Use pure turpenes inside of oil.
</p>

<p>
	Both methods work excellently and can be used with basically any powedered psychedelics, including 5-MeO-DMT. You can made a 5-MeO-DMT vape pen. But watch out, even one puff is very intense. Plugging is still superior for 5-MeO-DMT. If N,N-DMT plugged, I would plug it.

<p>
	Solipsism is not awakening. The mistake is thinking that what I'm talking about is solipism when I never made such a claim.
</p>

<p>
	The mind desperately wants some way to understand awakening so it grabs at every philosophical system is can: solipsism, nihilism, panpsychism, Buddhism, etc. And all of that is not awakening.

			firstly, only something ‘other than god’ would need to proclaim itself as being god. Why would god need to say ‘I’m god’,.. I mean... should I write it in my resume now that I’m enlightened? Do I get a free parking spot at selected restaurants that says ‘reserved for god’?
		</p>

		<p>
			Secondly, If you’re proclaiming that you are god, you can only say that to god. I mean think about it, why would you need to say ‘I am god’ and by the way, I won’t even say that you’re speaking to yourself, because that’s another trap the ego likes to hide in, but it just simply implies that you consider the person you’re proclaiming it to something other than god. Such energy can only perpetuate arrogance and entitlement, which are sticking points of ego, not enlightenment.

<p>
	You are speaking nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	You haven't realized what it means to be God. You are playing games.
</p>

<p>
	When you finally realize you are God, you will shout it from the top of your lungs. And all of your logic will fly out the window.
</p>

<p>
	You need to say "I am God" precisely because you're not conscious that you are. False humility is not a virtue here.

	Vaped some moderate doses of N,N-DMT. To me it feels very similar to a low dose of 5-MeO-DMT. Very similar headspace, but 5-MeO-DMT is a lot more potent. 5x to 10x more potent.

	Yup, it's brutal. Which is why alcohol exists.
</p>

<p>
	Without alcohol, the Earth's population would be 75% less.

<p>
	When doing approaches it's crucial to build up momentum. The first 5 approaches of the night are just a warm up. After the first 5, everything becomes much easier. After 15 approaches in one night, each next approach becomes effortless. Then the next night you gotta start all over again from zero.

<p>
	Notice your mind is acting defensively and selfishly.

<p>
	To whine about a historically oppressed group of people taking back their power is the epitome of douchebaggery.

<p>
	To compare feminism with RedPill is silly. They are not in the same ballpark.

For example, if my neighbor is killed and they need to do an investigation of the crime. The police could take a psychedelic and travel back in time to the moment the crime took place to identify the suspects. We could also predict future natural disasters or terrorist attacks.  As you said, science will make more progress in 1 decade with psychedelics than any other field. I don’t see why it can’t be applied practically.

<p>
	Depends on many factors.
</p>

<p>
	The very notion of enlightenment as temporary or permement is dualistic and untennable since time is imaginary. From God's POV it makes no difference if you awaken for 1 minute or 100 years. As a human you may not like only being awake for 1 minute, but that's not God's problem.
</p>

<p>
	You are only as conscious as your current state of consciousness. It could change any second.
</p>

<p>
	There are states of awakening so high that you could not function as a human from such a state. You could not walk or eat because you'd be too conscious. Life is impossible in such states. So in practice awakening gets tuned down to functional levels or the person would soon die. The highest states are temporary for such practical reasons.
</p>

<p>
	It is not practical to have your car's gas pedal permanently pressed down at max.

I can get lost in conceptualisation because the mind doesn’t want to turn inwards. Abandoning all concepts and ideas is necessary then to become concious of what conciousness is. This is what marks the transition from stage yellow to turquoise. As I long as I continue to distract myself on this forum by trying to understand awakening and conciousness the farther I get away from The Truth. The next step for me is to do the practices and stop distracting myself on this forum.

<p>
	Don't fret too much. All this intellectualization is part of your path.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, eventually you will transcend it all.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not  straight path from A to B. It's a twisted path from A to Z with a bunch of stuff in between.
</p>

<p>
	You are struggling to realize you ate God. It doesn't make sense to your human mind how it is possible that you could be God. But keep at it and one day you will awaken. Psychedelics help enormously.

One the number 0-9 are the truly indifferent  numbers once you get to 10 your just combining these numbers its doesn’t seem like its diversely infinite its like using the power of unlimited space to basically repeat forever i mean yeah in a sense if you count up they all be different in a way but they also be very simular 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, each number is unique.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to use 0-9, you could invent a new symbol for each number.
</p>

<p>
	We use 0-9 because it's easier than having to invent and memorize a million symbols.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing special about 0-9. It's just a social convention.
</p>

<p>
	11 is as unique as 1 or 2.

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics isn't really a measure of consciousness, it's a measure of mental development. Ultimately this is a minor and existentially insigificant thing. Awakening does not map to Spiral Dynamics at all. SD is just a handy model for understanding average humans.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the sense of awakening in a totally different league.
</p>

<p>
	Look around you. Can you point to anything which isn't consciousness? Try.

	Debates are only done ignorant minds.

<p>
	Ignorants love to spin their wheels in their ignorance. Ignorance likes to strut around and posture like a cock. That's what debate is. It has nothing to do with genuine truth-seeking.

			I understand that. But please describe "fully conscious." It's a misnomer. The Dial is infinite, and your consciousness of God deepens and broadens all the time. At what point do you say, "now you're fully conscious."? I'm baffled that something you recently described as a complex set of dials has now been reduced to a binary on/off. From my experience and others, it's clear that the dial analogy is much more accurate. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It is an infinite dial, but there are points on the dial where God awakens to itself as God.
</p>

<p>
	God realization is a distinct event. Either it is, or is not occuring. This point delineates awakeness vs asleepness. But even so, there are many degrees to God's self-awareness. Hence many levels of awakeness.
</p>

<p>
	Almost no one has reached the highest levels. Not even your favorite enlightened teachers. I consider most of them asleep.

<p>
	Kambo will make you vomit your guts out.
</p>

<p>
	But that can be healing.
</p>

<p>
	You can use the search function to find some old threads about peoples' experiences with it.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't expect it to heal serious things like Alzheimers. But it might heal you at the mental/spiritual level, helping you shed some ego.
</p>

<p>
	Kambo is not a psychedelic at all. It is a poison. It's basically like deliberately getting bit by a snake just for the experience.
</p>

<p>
	When you are being aware that you are human, you are actually misunderstanding what you are. You are imagining that you are human, in the same way that you could imagine that you are a kangaroo. But that doesn't make you a kangaroo. Only in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you are God. But you are too busy imagining you are human to notice this. The human obscures the God like clouds the sun.

	As you do more of this work you will become more compassionate with regards to the needless suffering of others.
</p>

<p>
	You need a heart awakening to really start to care about people. Most peoples' hearts are so closed and all they care about is themselves. But you cannot create a well-functioning and healthy community that way.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a family in which no one cared about the others. It would be a toxic disaster.

</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean you can't be passionate about your LP.
</p>

<p>
	But also, if you're first starting to become conscious of the existential Emptiness of life, that will likely rob you of motivation and make you depressed for a short period of time until you integrate it and the ego gets over it.
</p>

<p>
	A sense of meaninglessness and loss is a common egoic reaction to deep consciousness work. It will pass once you go deeper. It is one of the many threshold guardians which guard the deepest Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Trust that your sense of passion will come back even stronger once you fully awaken. But also be open to your passions changing and evolving. Maybe your passion for your current work will die completely but that's because some new greater passion with take its place. Be open to that.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, the ego will go through a period of mourning its own death. Just like it does with the death of a loved one. There is a period of resistance, emotional upheaval, depression, then acceptance, letting go, and moving on.

<p>
	Of course authoritarianism exists precisely because it works.
</p>

<p>
	But it only works up to a certain point.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness it stops working and becomes counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	So yes, at certain (low) levels of consciousness you have to be a dick to be successful.
</p>

<p>
	But at the highest levels of consciousness being a dick will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Not understanding that there are different levels of consciousness and that your followers have different levels of consciousness and different systems of values will make this guy's analysis and interviews incomplete.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different leadership styles which correspond to consciousness and values levels. Not to mention that you someone cannot escape being a dick if they are stuck in a certain level of consciousness. The leader himself has to grow massively to stop being authoritarian and yet remain effective. This is not easy to do for most people. Which is why its so rare and authoritarianism and abuse of power is so common.

<p>
	Yes, you are afraid. I understand that. Your entire life is dominated by survival and fear of death. That's what keeps you from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Smoking DPT 50 times is not dangerous if done properly. Nor do you have to smoke DPT at all. You could simply do some hardcore meditation or self-inquiry. DPT would just be a shortcut since I know how lazy you are. Your mind is too lazy to meditate for 30 days straight. So something like DPT is useful.

<p>
	Yes, I am God. That is Absolute Truth.

<p>
	Do you want me to lie and say I am not God when I clearly am? That would be a lie. Whether your mind likes the Truth or not is not my concern. That is your own limitation to transcend.
</p>

<p>
	Saying I am God does not make me superior to you, since God is all things. I am fully conscious that I am you. But you are not fully conscious that you are me. That's the only difference. There is no superior or inferior in the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	I know that I am God. But you do not know that you are God. So here I am trying to help you to understand that you are God. And here you are resisting it with all your ability. Because if you realized you are God, you would die to being a human. Fear of death has completely warped your mind such that you cannot understand my communication. Your mind is ensuring that you misunderstand me because it cannot allow you to understand me. That's too dangerous from your limited human POV. I understand all this, but you do not.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The ego mind desires demonstrations. Awakening has nothing to do with manipulating realty. Awakening is the realization that everything is exactly as it is.
</p>

<p>
	No one can awaken you but yourself. God will never force itself on you. I am not going to play your games of trying to change your mind because your mind is not interested in change. Your mind is closed and you are not interested in serious inquiry as is clear by your arrogant attitude and lack of serious work. If you were doing serious work you would  not be on this forum arguing with me and asking for demonstrations. You would deep in meditation & contemplation trying to realize the Truth for yourself. But you are not at this point yet because you're very early in your journey. You are skeptical, and I totally get that. But you must understand that from my POV your skepticism is as silly as a child doubting that 1+1=2. It is a waste of time to even entertain such skepticism from an awakened position. Absolute Truth is prior to any possible skepticism or doubt because it is not a function of thought, belief, or mind. Absolute Truth cannot be thought, so it cannot be doubted either.

			Why not do something like use Infinite Intelligence to discover a working HIV or coronavirus vaccine? Prove P=NP or the Riemann Hypothesis? Or sequester every molecule of carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere to stop climate change? Why not predict the next stock that is about to explode? I'm sure you could find a way to make the winnings serve the will of God, if that is a precondition.

	Because all "use", utility, and value is a fiction. Nothing needs to be changed. Reality is Absolute Perfection. But you are too busy looking for utility, too busy manipulating reality to awaken to this fact. You want to drag God down into the domain of survival, thinking this will prove God. But this assumes survival is a true domain. In fact, survival is the domain of falsehood so God has no business there. God does not care about survival. It is beneath God. So rather than trying to drag God down to your level you must be willing to raise yourself up to God's level.
</p>

<p>
	The will of God is EVERYTHING! That's what you don't fathom. Nothing can happen which isn't the will of God. The whole planet could die tomorrow and it would be perfectly fine. Realizing this creates liberation since there is no need to manipulate anything. Manipulation is a function of survival which is falsehood. To God it does not matter what happens because God's mind is conscious enough to see that all value and judgment is falsehood. No state of reality is better or worse than any other. So there is no need to change it. Awakening does not grant the ego the ability to manipulate the world using God's will, rather it eliminates the ego entirely, surrendering you to God will precisely as it is. It is the ego-mind which wants to use God's powers to manipulate the world. And that is precisely what God will not allow because that would be to allow devilry to flourish.
</p>

<p>
	If you wish to access God, the cost is total surrender of your self. You must give up all of your attachments and demands. Which, of course, is the last thing you want to do. You want to hijack God for your selfish purposes. If you could, you would try to use God to become a tyrant over men. You would try to use God to get sex, power, money, luxury, and everything else your impure ego craves. And this is precisely what you are denied. Because that is devilry.

<p>
	Omniscience isn't what you imagine it to be. It is not a knowledge of relative things. It is Absolute Consciousness. All knowledge is finite and relative. I don't know what you had for breakfast. But I am conscious of how I create the entire universe. That's the paradox of awakening.

	That is your problem. You fundamentally misunderstand this work. This work is not about me convincing you of anything. This work requires that you be willing to surrender your arrogant mind in a personal search for Truth. You have to want the Truth so bad that it will literally kill you. And that is precisely what you don't want. So you will never find the Truth and I will never be able to convince you otherwise. Because your entire attitude comes from fear. You don't care about Truth, your mind is just acting out survival mechanisms.

			I am also curious about one more thing. I remember watching a video of yours where you stated that science will be done non-symbolically 500 years from now. What did you mean by that exactly? Are you thinking that the nondual paradigm would affect scientific research traditions for the better? Can you give me a brief sketch of what this would look like, especially in areas like neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology and fundamental physics?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Science and mysticism will start to merge. The greatest scientists will be those who can access non-ordinary states of consciousness and have direct insight into the nature of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Science is by definition symbolic because it requires communication and coordination which cannot be done other than through language. But individual scientists can venture off by themselves and explore consciousness and bring back nuggets. The difficulty will be coordinating that with others.
</p>

<p>
	Science itself will be transcended and that transcendence of it will eventually transform what science is.
</p>

<p>
	No matter how much science you do, you will always be as far away from understand reality as you were before you started doing science. Because reality is infinite and science is finite. So you can do science forever and still never get any closer to the end. All scientific discovery is relative. Relative, but useful.
</p>

<p>
	Neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and fundamental physics will admit that their discoveries are relative to certain states of consciousness. Fundamental physics is only true relative to an ordinary human state of consciousness and within a very narrow symbolic framework. All science is human species biased and ultimately imaginary. But imaginary things can still be useful. So it's useful for survival.
</p>

	Anyhow, this will be my last communication here. I cannot teach a student who insists he is right.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck with your journey through the labyrinths of your own mind.
</p>

<p>
	I wish you total awakening.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Try to really appreciate this: your mind is deliberately tricking you not to awaken. Every thought you think is already hijacked to maintain your sense of self and reality. So when you think, "Leo is wrong" << that's already the trick.

<p>
	Selfishness always works in the short-term but crumbles in the long-term because Truth is selfless and the self is false.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same reason life always ends in death. Death is Truth so it must always win out.

	You guys love to play word games.
</p>

<p>
	When you are fully conscious that you are God, that is enlightenment/awakening. How long it lasts is irrelevant. It could last 1 minute or 100 years. For as long as you are conscious, you are awake. As soon as you are not conscious, you are asleep.
</p>

<p>
	If you are in doubt whether you're awake, you're asleep. If you have questions about what God is or means, you are asleep.
</p>
