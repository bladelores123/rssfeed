	All distinctions are imaginary.

<p>
	Imagination = distinction = reality

<p>
	You are confused because you cannot get it without awakening.

</p>

<p>
	So don't take psychedelics any more and just focus on basic self-help.

	Lol, Gates is too busy with other things to bother with such minutia.
</p>

<p>
	Also understand that no single person runs a conpany as large as Microsoft. Microsoft is a super-organism of its own. It's way beyond Bill Gates.

<p>
	Caring about little people doesn't mean you save every person.

<p>
	That's great.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some tips to improve your game:
</p>

<p>
	1) She will almost always say she's gotta go. In this case, ask if you can walk with her and continue chatting. You need as much chat time as possible. Don't just accept her excuses. She will always have excuses.
</p>

<p>
	2) Never do Facebook. It's bullshit. Get her number and text.
</p>

<p>
	3) Before you even try for a number ALWAYS try for an instant date. After a short chat, don't ask for her number, ask to get a coffee right now. If she says she's too busy, then get the number.
</p>

<p>
	4) Rather than asking her questions, make interesting observations about her. So instead of, "What do you do?", you say, "You seem like the kind of girl who works with kids." Or whatever. Doesn't matter what you say. Sometimes you can make purposefully wrong assumptions about her just to tease her.
</p>

<p>
	5) If she tells you she's a lawyer, you gotta tease her for that shit: "OMG! I walked over here loving you but I hate you now. I can tell you have an evil lawyer heart." And push her away in a playful manner.
</p>

<p>
	Find every excuse to playfully touch her.
</p>

<p>
	6) Get in the habit of asking, "By the way, are you single?"
</p>

<p>
	7) Always seed the next date. Insist that you will text her and that you two will grab a coffee and talk.
</p>

Will they help with this?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	You can also just go to the mall and walk around while practicing making funny observations to yourself about ordinary things you see in the mall. Train yourself to have a commentary on any random thing you see: a tree, a car, a bird, a dog, a bench, an ad, etc.
</p>

<p>
	DO NOT try to script or memorize this stuff. It won't work. Rather you need to train the ability to improv it on the spot.
</p>

<p>
	It helps a lot to put yourself in a good mood as you try to do this. You gotta be relaxed and playful. Not stiff and business-like.
</p>

<p>
	When talking to girls you gotta be like a kid in a candy store. Passionate, playful, spontaneous.
</p>

<p>
	That has always been the case and always will always be the case.
</p>

<p>
	UBI is not going to automatically solve the technology problem. If robots are doing all the work for mankind, mankind has become redundant and will go extinct.
</p>

<p>
	Of course manufacturing jobs in the US were lost. The world is globalizing. You cannot stop that. Americans need to enter service jobs and creative jobs.

<p>
	You are the one stuck on this idea of automation, which is an ideology you absorbed from Yang.
</p>

<p>
	So mind your projections.
</p>

<p>
	Automation is one issue out of dozens. It is not the top issue and America should not be governed by what Rust-Belt states personally want.
</p>

<p>
	One person, one vote. Not Rust-Belt runs the show.

<p>
	Sounds like kundalini. You are stuck at the lower chakras so you're wasting that energy on sex because that's your current level of consciousness/development.
</p>

<p>
	As you spiritually purify yourself you will seek less and less of lower bodily pleasures like junk, TV, and sex.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of yoga is to purify the chakras, body, and mind to unhook you from chasing lower bodily pleasures like sex, food, money, fame, power. All of that wastes enormous energy which could be put to higher use.
</p>

		<p>
			Yeah I am well aware about that. Being in a happy relationship already. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I am also well aware that sleeping with a new girl each week is more than reasonable. <br />
			<br />
			The thing I mean specifically, if that makes sense, is what are the limits to creating a fast and lasting connection with a girl in the first place. Like first 5 to 10 minutes you meet her. So far this always came naturally to me at times and sometimes it doesn't which I am generally fine with since you don't connect with everybody. But I wanted to understand to which degree I got to develop myself to being able to have lasting connection with a girl within these first minutes and if I am maybe trying to create something that is stupid, since it is not really important. <br />
			<br />
			I know that if I would date a girl I would have dates etc. and it be on. But randomly without the direct intention of sleeping with her next days to create a connection that she is naturally attracted and kind of in (love). That is what I want to understand, wether I am still lacking this kind of fast connection skill at times. I also don't want to fake anything but be myself for sure. <br />
			<br />
			By the way I see that this is highly egoic intention for validation seeking. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This whole description might be hard to put into words, because it is not so much about the "fuck a bunch of hot girls" thing. But more about my ability to show up as myself and be able to game or attract girls passively while creating a genuine attraction from my side. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Any further advice on this particular thing?
		</p>

		<p>
			Thanks
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Why are you worried about this at all? Just go talk to girls and see what happens.
</p>

<p>
	There are no limits. Attraction can happen in 1 minute and you can build deep rapport within a few hours of conversation.
</p>

<p>
	You can make deep friendships with any random person if you really wanted to.
</p>

<p>
	It does not really matter who the girl is, you can bond with her. It's just a matter of deciding which girls are worth your time and meet your standards.
</p>

<p>
	Get clear about what you want and don't want. The rest will sort itself out.
</p>

			I don't understand why is it necessary to have this tragic view on life as meaningless. Why is it helpful? What's good about it?
		</p>

		<p>
			Nihilism and lack of meaning lead to depression and despair.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not a tragic view. That's just how your ego interpets it. You are assigning negative meaning to meaningless, which of course is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to awaken without confronting the truth that all meaning is imaginary. To the ego this can feel depressing and deflating because your ego's whole plan is to concoct and chase meanings until you're dead.
</p>

<p>
	Depression can be a problem on this path, but don't blame it on meaninglessness, blame it on ego.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel this work is making you unstable, take a break for a while. Come back to it later. It means you're not ready yet to go that deep.
</p>

<p>
	Understand that awakening is a very hardcore pursuit. You must be very mature to want it and to actualize it. Many of you are simply not there yet. Don't force it too much. Go live a bit of life first before you try to go full-Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	Full-Buddha is definitely not for most people. You have to really be fed up with material life to go full-Buddha. Many of you here have barely begun material life. Ask yourself why you are pursuing awakening? Is it simply because you are blindly doing whatever Leo talks about? Or does your heart truly desire it?
</p>

<p>
	Be careful doing things I talk about simply because you heard me talk about it.
</p>

	It takes 1000s of approaches to get decently comfortable doing it. And even then, you won't want to do the first few of the day/night.
</p>

<p>
	This is why people drink alcohol.

<p>
	You can get so good you can sleep with a new girl every week.
</p>

<p>
	But that takes a lot of work and training.
</p>

<p>
	Not saying you should do this. Just saying what's possible.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind what you probably just want is to get a nice girlfriend. So that's probably your best goal.

<p>
	Yeah, that is a classic newbie problem. You gotta train yourself to talk your mouth off about yourself. Be totally self-absorbed. Become a chatterbox. Don't hold any thoughts back. Talk about your opinions, desires, hates, plans, feelings, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Talk about the smallest, dumbest things like how you were flossing your teeth today.
</p>

<p>
	You can practice at home in front of a camera. Record yourself explaining how you ate breakfast today and how you felt about it. Make it sound interesting. You gotta turn ordinary life into stories.
</p>

<p>
	STOP BEING LOGICAL in your conversations with girls! That is crucial. Untrain your logicalness.
</p>

<p>
	A good trick is, rather than asking questions, make observations and statements. So instead of asking, "What do you do for work?" or "Where are you from?", you make random or informed guesses like, "You seem like a California girl" or "You seem like you work in marketing."
</p>

<p>
	It makes no difference if your guess was right or wrong.
</p>

<p>
	You can even make the dumbest observations such as: "Hey, did you know you're sitting next to a palm tree? Did you bother to think about it's feelings? What if it hates when you sit so close next to it? What if you smell like a skunk to the palm tree? Why are you so inconsiderate? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />"
</p>

<p>
	This kinda stuff is gold, but you gotta train yourself to be this stupid.

<p>
	It's very hard to explain it. Such consciousness is totally outside of your ability to imagine.
</p>

<p>
	It's even hard for me to imagine it when I'm not in the peak of it.
</p>

<p>
	There exist states of consciousness so alien and radical that you might as well have died and become another being in another universe.

<p>
	Automation is overblown. That isn't our top problem.
</p>

<p>
	If automation ever becomes a big deal and UBI becomes necessary, we can pass it rather quickly if people want it.

<p>
	The automation problem can be addressed in ways other than UBI for now.

	You could make a movie about love. The movie has alreay been, but then it unfolds before your eyes for the first time in a linear sequence.

<p>
	Of course it's important not to get complacent. Vote regardless of what you think the odds are.
</p>

<p>
	I think people will be super-excited to vote in 2020. More than ever. I know I am.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's biggest gift to our democracy will be to rouse people from their complacency about voting and following the news. Trumpism will lead to a whole generation of young people eager for bold progressive ideas. Republicans are going to turn off a whole generation of young people with their foolish support of Trump. They will be suffering the cost of that in the decades to come.
</p>

<p>
	Trump reveals the Republican's true colors. Which is a great thing. People like Mitt Romny & the Bushes have put too much lipstick on that pig. Now everyone sees the pig underneath the lipstick.
</p>

<p>
	Trump waltzed in the White House and basically just said, "Let's be shameless pigs." And most of the Republicans said, "Okay, I guess. We were sorta doing that anyway. But can't we put some lipstick on it? Without the lipstick it's too ugly to look at."

			When you say "I don't find Yang's policies to be progressive enough," what you really mean is that he doesn't display the progressive ethos or ideal you have in your mind. And this is the root of your ideology. It's not the policies themselves that draws you in like you claim, it's actually this fighting spirit or "populist revolution" attitude you believe Sanders to provide. You believe Sanders will provide the kick we need to get the gears turning. No matter how they turn, we just need them turning.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No. He is the most serious candidate in terms of specific policy reforms which America badly needs. He has the longest, most proven track record of being a visionary leader in terms of the progressive agenda (over 40 years). He has the passion, the vision, the right leadership style, the balls to take on the status quo, the insider experience in Washington necessary to understand how the system works, he has the largest grassroots donor base of anyone in the country, he has tangible policies, and he doesn't play games with identity politics.
</p>

<p>
	He has a lot of experience with how to deal with Republicans, Washington insiders, and media. He know exactly what to do and he can be trusted to do it (as long as his healthy holds up). He also has the best understanding of foreign policy of the Dem candidates.
</p>

<p>
	This is not about ideology.
</p>

<p>
	And it helps that he actually has a decent chance of winning. Yang's chances are very long. I don't want to give my support and money to someone who probably will not win. Yang might be a good choice in 2024 or 2028 when he has some more experience and name-recognition. This kind of thing needs to be built over time.

			2. God is divided into infinite parts and whatever these parts decide to do becomes gods will too (the question arises: where do decisions preceded by thought and therefore where do thoughts come from?)

	Those questions cannot be answered in words because words are dualistic and the answers are nondual.

Standard YangGang points. Nothing new you're telling me.
</p>

<p>
	I've watched his interviews. He says the same stuff every time.
</p>

<p>
	May the best (wo)man win.
</p>

<p>
	I don't doubt that Yang or Bernie would beat Trump. Their biggest hurdle is beating the other Dems.
</p>

<p>
	I think Yang will over-perform in the end but not beat the other Dems. Let's see how it goes. Should be fun to watch. I'm guessing Yang will do well because he feels so authentic.

<p>
	Not in practice.
</p>

<p>
	I've split tested it. Doesn't matter what you write as long as you got the right profile pics. And if you don't, no amount of writing will help you.
</p>

<p>
	Try it yourself. Create a profile using some random handsome white tall masculine dude's pictures. Write nothing at all. Just say "Hi". Girls will come a flocking. Then try that with your crappy selfies. Crickets...
</p>

<p>
	Some guys have it SO easy online. You just need that classic look. Or very low standards. Of course if you're willing to sleep with absolutely anyone, you can get lucky.

<p>
	That's the beauty of Sanders, he will lead a populist revolution to publicly shame them and shift our entire culture. That's what's really needed. No progressive laws are gonna pass a Republican controlled Senate anyway. Republicans are not going to let Yang do anything and they will demonize him as a socialist.
</p>

<p>
	Meeting them half-way is what we've been doing for the last 40 years. Something new is needed.
</p>

<p>
	Also, your analogy between Malcolm X:Bernie, MLK:Yang is not right. MLK was a radical progressive socialist. So if anything Bernie is like MLK. Malcolm X was a militant ideologue which is not analogous to Bernie. Bernie is leading a progressive social movement just like MLK.

<title>Can life purpose solve the dating issue?</title>

<p>
	Being successful and a leader in your field opens a lot of doors and opportunities.
</p>

<p>
	Once you get really good in your field and people start to know about you, women will naturally come your way. This is mostly because you have become more visible, not because they want your money.
</p>

<p>
	But still, I wouldn't rely on this strategy exclusively. If you're a computer nerd working in your basement 12 hours a day, no women will ever find you no matter how good you are. You gotta start being visible publicly.
</p>

<p>
	The key is being more social. And getting good in your field can help you to increase your socialness.
</p>

<p>
	Why do rockstars get laid every night? Because they are visible to 10,000 people every night. Not because there's anything special about playing music. Although girls love music because it boosts their emotional state, so that does help. Music is like a drug.
</p>

<p>
	Or, you could just increase your socialness by going out every night and being social. Waiting for women to come to you is indirect.
</p>

<title>Yang vs. Sanders</title>

</p>

<p>
	But I feel he's way too stuck on UBI as his signature policy to the point to being a one-note candidate.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, a candidate has to be evaluated holistically, taking into account every thing, including their experience with politics and government.
</p>

<p>
	Yang's biggest upside, in my mind, is his authenticity. But I don't consider his policies progressive enough.
</p>

<p>
	UBI could easily be dismantled by conservatives in the future and hurt the welfare state.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you're welcome to vote for whoever you like best. I got nothing against Yang. He's a cool guy and if he wins I will vote for him.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Non-existence isn't real, it is imaginary!
</p>

<p>
	There is only existence. Existence is an Absolute and has no opposite.
</p>

<p>
	A non-existent object is actually an existent object in your imagination. But you are misunderstanding that object's true nature. You take it as really non-existent when it is actually existent as a thought. Your mind confuses thoughts and objects. For example, you confuse thoughts of your mother for your mother.
</p>

<p>
	The kicker is, if you didn't create this confusion you couldn't have a mother. Since a mother is a thought, not an object.
</p>

<p>
	So how are you gonna escape this confusion? Escaping it would mean the collapse of your entire reality. Can you stomach that?
</p>

<p>
	We have had decades of inaction.
</p>

<p>
	Sanders is just the kick in the ass we need. Of course he won't be able to pass everything he wants. But he will lead a movement that will shift the overtone window seriously left, which is what we have been lacking for 50 years.
</p>

<p>
	Sanders could be the next FDR. If only he was younger.
</p>

<p>
	Working class people, even Republicans will like Bernie as he pushes against elites.
</p>

<p>
	The ones who hate Bernie are mostly elites.
</p>

<p>
	A working class person is not going to hate Bernie.
</p>

<p>
	FDR was the most popular president of all time. But the elites hated him. I predict a similar sitation if Bernie wins.
</p>

<p>
	Of course hardcore conservatives will demonize him. But they demonized Obama, so there is no pleasing them.
</p>

<p>
	Fox News will demonize no matter who the Democratic president is.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple: is your birth happening right now? No? Then you are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	If you object, "Yeah, but at one time it really was happening", just notice that you are imagining that too.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot ever escape imagination. If a thing is not being imagined right now, it doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple. You just don't want to accept it because you want things to be "real".
</p>

<p>
	Everything is imaginary, including brains, atoms, planets, science, logic, and your life.
</p>

<p>
	Brains seem to exist from your POV because that is what you're stuck imagining without being aware that you are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness imagines a brain. Your entire paradigm is backwards.

	You don't need to zoom into it. It is already nothing as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Form is nothing. Don't go hunting for nothing. Nothing is everywhere. You are like a fish hunting for water.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, space is not nothing, it is something. But since something is ultimately nothing, space is also nothing.

<p>
	Of course you can't upgrade the level of development of an entire country by several stages in 15 years.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless you guys are making progress. You got to work out those tribal differences and learn the value of pluralistic democracy which tolerates minority rights. Learning that less will take you guys 50-100 years, but you gotta start wherever you're at. It's not like the Saddam situation was sustainable. Eventually he would have died of natural causes, his sons would have been even worse than him, and there would be a bloody revolution to overthrown them. So the US invasion only hastened the inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	Forcing people to vote is still better than no voting at all.
</p>

<p>
	Even in America 50% of people don't vote.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not so bad. Things will get better.

<p>
	To call Actualized.org religion would be inappropriate. To call it spirituality is more appropriate, although limited.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Online dating requires above average looks, REALLY good professional profile photos (no selfies), and massive volume.
</p>

<p>
	Online dating requires serious work. You don't just put up a profile and start getting dates. You gotta game it more than real life.
</p>

<p>
	Online girls are screening you almost entirely on looks because they have nothing else to go by. Your personality has no chance to charm them. In real life you can hit much higher outside your league with charm and boldness. This cannot be done online. The girl has to decide whether she will sleep with you purely based on your profile photo in 1 second.
</p>

<p>
	If you're turning online because you're too lazy to do it in real life, chances are your results will be bad. Laziness is not a viable strategy for finding attractive females.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a classically handsome appearance, you can do well online. If not...
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, there's much more to reforming government than a single proposal like UBI.
</p>

<p>
	UBI vs jobs guarantee is like 7th on the list of important issues.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful about turning into a single-issue voter. A politician must considered holistically, not on the basis of one cool proposal.

<title>What is the difference between religion and spirituality?</title>

<p>
	Religion is just spirituality turned into unquestioned ideology.
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean spirituality is free of dogma or ideology. Just that religion is much, much worse.
</p>

<p>
	Religion is what you call it when spirituality has turned into a cancer of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Corruption is like water, it seeps into every crack.

<p>
	If you're going to speak about infinity or God, first understand what you are talking about. It's very clear when someone speaks of these things without any direct experience of them.

<p>
	It's consistent for the same reason a novelist or screenwriter strives to make his writing consistent -- so that you think it is real.
</p>

<p>
	That's how illusions are made.

<p>
	What you're noticing with your line of questioning is the collapse of the selfish/selfless duality.
</p>

<p>
	You should expect all such dualities to breakdown at the edges when you question them deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	God is the Absolute Unity for all dualities.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot say that God is X because God is also not X, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity is unqualifiable. Anything you say about it is always finite, partial, limited, and in a sense, misleading. Absolute Infinity cannot be fully explicated in finite form. Infinity is by its very nature implicit. It cannot be fully unfolded (because it goes on forever).

	There is software you can install which will block your access to certain websites you select, like YouTube or whatever. You can even set a schedule in this software so that you can access YouTube after work, or on the weekends but not during weekdays.

<p>
	This kind of thing can help give your life some structure if you are unable to discipline yourself.

<title>Is Bernie Sanders a populist?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/40835-is-bernie-sanders-a-populist/?do=findComment&amp;comment=511215</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Yes, but the difference is that Sanders is genuinely concerned about little people. Trump is not. Trump is obsessed with materialism and wealth and fame. So he's just an oligarch in populist clothing.
</p>

<p>
	It's not enough to speak populism. You have to walk your talk. You can't be a serious populist if live in a $100 million dollar house and play golf every weekend with millionaires.
</p>

<p>
	A real populist would care about the lowest classes of society. Trump is the opposite of that. He only uses populist language when it suits his rise to the top.
</p>

<p>
	This is a classic tactic. It's called demagogery. Nazis, fascists, and Communists were masters at this.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Funny enough, Bill Gates lives in a $100 million house, yet he still cares about helping poor people. So it's complicated. It is possible to be rich and still care a lot about little people. But it tends to be rare. And Trump certainly isn't that way. What really matters is not your wealth but your level of consciousness and compassion for others. It's no accident that wealthy people often lack compassion because they needed to be ruthless to earn their wealth in the first place. It's very hard to earn a billion dollars without being ruthlessly exploitative.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, any firewall we build will be abusable by future devils. Nevertheless, in practice, a better gov and court system helps to keep the biggest devils at bay.
</p>

<p>
	As an example, slavery is no longer possible in most of the world due to suffciently evolved legal systems. This was not the case 500 years ago. Of course our legal system can still be exploited, but not nearly as badly as it used to be. So there is improvement.

<p>
	You have to ground yourself in the desire for Truth as opposed to meaning.
</p>

<p>
	If Truth is what you most desire, and the Truth turns out to meaningless, you will be satisfied with it because what you really wanted was the Truth, regardless of what it is.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want meaning more than Truth, then you're in trouble because of the Truth happens to be that all meaning is imaginary, you will have to deny it or act upset.
</p>

<p>
	To desire Truth is to want it regardless of what it is. Truth for truth's sake.

<p>
	Maps come in various degrees of accuracy, with some being totally wrong. But even if you have a very accurate map it is important be conscious that the map is never the territory it depicts.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it's important to understand that "the Earth" is an imagination you are now having.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that there is no Earth in your current direct experience. Which obviously means you must be imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	The floor you're standing or sitting on is not "the Earth".

This individual is my father who is at rock bottom. He doesn't take responsibility for the idea of the trip but has expressed to me that he is willing to take my advice and help seriously. He says that he can't take another month of what his mind is currently doing. He watched something on the news last night about how some people are using Psilocybin to cure depression and anxiety, so something external besides myself is providing him with information within his paradigm. He refuses to help himself, but is continuing to question this. He has asked other people close to us about the experience. He asks them "so what do I do? Do I just sit there? Do I walk around?" <br />
			<br />
			Does this possibly re-contextualize the question for you? If it doesn't, do you know any other approaches I could take that would see quick short term improvements?

<p>
	Yes, that is better.
</p>

<p>
	In which case 1g of mushrooms or 75ug of LSD is a great starting point.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure he's not on SSRI medication.
</p>

<p>
	And explain to him some of the basic theory of how the mind constructs all of reality. He needs to understand that psychedelics are not a hallucination any more than a brick wall is. As he's tripping tell him to contemplate how his mind is constructing reality.

	I've considered it, but I'm not really interested in interviewing others. I'm mostly interested in sharing deep insights directly with my viewers.
</p>

<p>
	Interviewing people requires a different intent and skillset. I have too much to say.
</p>

<p>
	I'm also not really interested in waiting for someone else to ask me deep questions. I would rather cut to the point.

</p>

<p>
	Do not give psychedelics to random people who are not taking responsibility for the trip.
</p>

<p>
	The person doing the trip should proactively do research and have an intrinsic motivation to trip. They should not be apathetically popping a pill that some random friend gave them.
</p>

<p>
	This is going to create problems. You cannot just assume that he will have a great mystical trip. Many people are not ready for the radical nature of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that you could make his situation worse and you will be blamed for that.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are something you have to really desire to do. You have to have a need for it. You have to proactively seek it out.

<p>
	Meaning is relative.
</p>

<p>
	Love, Intelligemce, and Beauty are Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Meaning limits love.

<p>
	I was exactly in your shoes at your age.
</p>

<p>
	First thing I did was drop 65 pounds. Then, later, I started learning about how to attract women.
</p>

<p>
	You need a lot more socialization experience. You need to put yourself into social environments and practice socializing, not only with women but also with men.
</p>

<p>
	At 18 years old you're not supposed to have sexual experience.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but what are you gonna do with your life after awakening?
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose only starts to get serious after awakening.

<p>
	It is not ideological unless you turn it into an ideology.
</p>

<p>
	I warned you from day 1 not to turn my teachings into an ideology.
</p>

<p>
	You must use my teachings consciously. How you use them depends on you. Many warnings have been issued.
</p>

<p>
	It would be a good idea to clearly distinguish in your experience what it means to act ideologically and what what it means to act consciously.

	On mushrooms I once became conscious that I created all the dinosaurs.

<p>
	Not what you were asking, but eh...

<p>
	Weird shit happens when you trip enough times.

<title>Why Psychedelic Awakenings are Insight 'Experiences' and not Permanent Awakenings</title>

<p>
	Please don't cite me "spontaneous insight". You have no idea what hell Tolle went through to earn his so-called "spontaneous insight."
</p>

<p>
	He spent 2 YEARS living on a park bench just to integrate it.
</p>

<p>
	Your logic is like saying an Olympic champion got his gold medal in a 30 minute ceremony.

<p>
	No! You still aren't getting it.
</p>

<p>
	You are using an imaginary notion of a "behind the scenes reality" to ground reality.
</p>

<p>
	Your are fooling yourself when you do this. You are anchoring reality in a fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well believe that there exists a behind the scenes space kangaroo who runs reality. There is as much evidence for space kangroos as there is of a behind the scenes brain.
</p>

<p>
	THERE IS NO BEHIND THE SCENE! There is only a groundless scene.
