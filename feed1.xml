<p>
	Freelance gigs are probably the simplest way to start. Although the market is flooded and pay usually isn't that good unless you've got some really good technical skills to offer.
</p>

<p>
	You can learn web programming pretty quickly and offer your services on freelancing websites like Upwork.com or Guru.com
</p>

<p>
	The better your skills and portfolio of work, the more money you'll make.
</p>

<p>
	How can I know what is right for you?
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like good plan if you are passionate about being an entrepreneur. Not everyone is cut out for that though. You have to be really self-driven.
</p>

<p>
	I LOVE working for myself. It's the coolest thing second to enlightenment. But it's not for everyone.

</p>

<p>
	Our education system is just in its infancy. Human society is still in the Dark Ages.
</p>

<p>
	In 500 years all of this will be reformed. People like us are the wave of the future.
</p>

<p>
	Children in 500 years will take all of this for granted. For them, self-actualization will be 100 times easier because there will be a vast infrastructure in place for it, unlike now.
</p>

<p>
	We are building the infrastructure for tomorrow, today!
</p>

<p>
	Until that project is complete we will have lots of horny, angry, depressed Incels demonizing women.

			Also keep in mind there's very limited education for males when it comes to interacting with women, there's nothing really in the mainstream geared towards this. In fact it's seen as sleazy etc there's very few real male discussions where you hear real men's perspectives, whereas you get loads of honest female perspectives on TV (the view or loose women if you're in the UK). Not to sound all mgtow but there needs to be some kind of healthy male influencers that can give real knowledge, otherwise they can fall into these hate filled rabbit holes online 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I agree. Our education system does a terrible job of teaching males about how to be healthy strong males and how to build relationships or attract women.

<p>
	When it comes to understanding women, many angry and depressed young males cannot do so because they are stuck in such a deficiency mindset. It's because they need women so badly to satisfy their sexual survival needs that they cannot see women fairly, objectively, impartially. So they tend to create all sorts of twisted narratives and misunderstandings of women -- ones which are designed to serve the man's ego needs.
</p>

<p>
	For example, lots of these types of men like to think of women as cheating sluts. It is not a true assessment of women, it's just the young horny male's distorted ego perception. It's much easier to call a woman a cheating slut than to admit that she didn't want to sleep with me because I am a weak, unattractive, juvenile male.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of these young males do not even recognize that a woman exists unless she is hot enough for them to sleep with. Any "ugly" woman is basically seen as a waste, and completely ignored. Why? Because their mind is only focused on getting its needs met.
</p>

<p>
	There in no genuine interest in understanding women, caring for women, or even trying to build healthy relationships with women. It's all about MY SEXUAL NEEDS! It's like a bum begging for quarters on the roadside. All he can think about it quarters and food. His whole perception of reality is warped by his dire and urgent survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	"Women only sleep with rich assholes and hot studs. They are sluts who will cheat on you the moment a hotter richer guy comes along." << this is actually a projection of the horny young male's ego. This is actually how HE would behave.
</p>

<p>
	Here's the real truth:
</p>

<p>
	"I (the guy) only want to sleep with hot attractive women. I am a slut who will cheat on the girl as soon as a hotter girl comes along because all I care about is looks."
</p>

<p>
	Projection 101
</p>

<p>
	Every time a guy says, "Women only care about looks" what he really means is, "I only care about looks". Whatever twisted version of reality he sees gets reflected by to him via confirmation bias and deficiency-perception.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I am all for that.
</p>

<p>
	But most people, especially those who subscribe to an ego-serving, fear-based or anger-based ideology are not open to having conversations. Because they believe they are right. Their minds are closed.

They will pull you down to their level with all their nonsense thinking.
</p>

<p>
	There are tons of high consciousness teachers and books available that you could be listening to instead.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than watching some right-wing fool rant about feminism, go watch a teacher like Sadhguru.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to distinguish real wisdom from egoic ideological propaganda.
</p>

<p>
	Real wisdom is never based in fear, anger, scapegoating, demonizing, ranting, blaming, complaining, etc.
</p>

<p>
	High consciousness people never complain about others.

<p>
	There is nothing scientific about this. This is utter nonsense based on cherry-picking, confirmation bias, and deficiency-needs perception.
</p>

<p>
	When the ego-mind's survival agenda is threatened it will distort its perception of reality to see reality in whatever way is helpful to getting its needs met or identity validated.
</p>

<p>
	To feel like a victimized man and maintain that identity these Incels and MGTOWs bring forth all sorts of stupid bro-"science" and rationalizations to justify themselves. But it's just an illusion based on fear, anger, depression, and ultimately very low levels of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	As soon as you hear people citing science/logic to justify their political or identity positions, you can pretty much be certain it's bullshit. This is what JP loves to do. He cites science in a cherry-picked way to valid his ego-mind's narrative of life.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind always appeals to "facts", "reality", "objectivity", and "fairness" because that's how it creates its subjective reality while denying that it did so. The reality is, the ego-mind does not give a flying fuck about truth or fairness. It is always distorting reality to get an unfair advantage.
</p>

<p>
	Online dating dynamics are highly biased. Online dating is not like real life dating because in real life a woman can get to know your personality (which is what primarily attracts women) whereas online all that really matters is physical appearance.
</p>

<p>
	Via online dating I could never attract a 10. But in person I have done so many times. You don't need to be a physically attractive guy to attract the hottest girl in the club. You just need a very strong personality, which of course these Incels do not have and do not want to do the hard work to develop. They just want to sit around and rationalize why they are victims.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There are many tools for doing that: journaling, contemplation, shadow work, psychedelics, shamanic breathing, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Meditating for 20 minutes should not produce any Dark Night.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta figure out your maze. I don't know why you're getting that.

Try to do 20 minutes. It takes about 10 minutes just for the mind to get into some kind of groove.
</p>

<p>
	Try to do some kind of formal technique to focus your mind, like following your breath or labeling or focusing on a mental simple mental image like a red circle in your mind's eye.
</p>

<p>
	Getting decent at meditation takes lots of practice. Usually months and years.
</p>

<p>
	You might benefit from a binural beats audio like Holosync. That's good for beginners who can't focus well.

This is a core existential problem. The trick is, the infinite and the finite are actually one and the same thing. So you might think you can escape the finitude of survival by appeals to infinity -- and in the Absolute sense you can -- but also in the relative sense you can't.
</p>

<p>
	In the relative physical domain in which survival takes place resources will always be finite, even though infinity is always true. In fact, it's because Infinity is always true that resources must be finite. This is the paradox of existence.
</p>

<p>
	But also, yes!, the more people become conscious of the infinite the less resources they need to be happy and the more intelligent they are so they can find new ways to extract more resources and distribute them far more efficiently.
</p>

<p>
	The Earth has enough raw resources to sustain 100s of billions of people and all the animals. The problem is we aren't using them efficiently or ecologically because we are so disconnected from Infinity. In the future this will get better and better as more peeps evolve up the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	At the highest levels of the Spiral survival still gets played, it's just played in much nicer ways.
</p>

<p>
	Case in point, compare 21st century society with ancient Rome where 40% of the population were slaves. That's a lot of progress in 2000 years. Survival still takes place today, but it's much less barbaric, more loving. But still can be harsh and deadly at times.

<p>
	There is no problem with materially enjoying women. The problem is in the toxic, egocentric ideology which MGTOW promotes.
</p>

<p>
	If all MGTOW was, was a call to action for men to improve their results with women and become better men, that would be great. But it is NOT that. It is a toxic victimization/demonization ideology.
</p>

<p>
	Materialism is the least of MGTOW's problems. The irony is, MGTOW will not even make you successful with women because it is such an energy drain. At least pickup can get you success with women.
</p>

<p>
	The whole appeal of subscribing to MGTOW is that then the guy does not have take responsibility for all of his failings as a man. It's just a way to scapegoat women. Which is really the opposite of what is required to become a strong healthy man.
</p>

<p>
	This is also the problem with Incels -- their toxic philosophy only deepens their predicament.
</p>

<p>
	These philosophies are like cancer. This is some of the saddest, disempowering stuff you'll ever read:

To understand psychedelics you must do psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	No amount of logic or evidence is going to convince parents that psychedelics are good for you. Because their position is irrational and dogmatic to begin with.

So any time you think of two parts to the world, you're not fully nondual yet.
</p>

<p>
	If there was a distinction between the formless state and your present formed perception state, that would be a duality. So you know that cannot be ultimately true.
</p>

<p>
	The final duality to eliminate is the duality between nonduality and duality!
</p>

<p>
	The snake must eat its own tail until nothing remains.
</p>

<p>
	Mu is the formless void state but ALSO the whole shebang: all of formed creation.
</p>

<p>
	Take a moment to look around the room you're sitting in right now. That is none other than Mu.
</p>

<p>
	To be fully nondual is to be conscious of Nothingness all the time, everywhere, no matter if you're in a formless state or eating breakfast. That is true awakening.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	It cannot be explained because explanation requires distinction/duality.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you still haven't experienced infinity though. Infinity is the other side of the Mu coin.
</p>

<p>
	Also, it's important that you have the insight that Mu is not other than everything you see around you right now. Mu is not limited to that null void state. It also includes the entire domain of form and perception. This insight is paramount, otherwise your realization is half-baked.

</p>

<p>
	There are deeper stages of which few people are aware.
</p>

<p>
	Martin's work is good (for an academic), but it's certainly not fathoming the full depth of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	I posted about Martin on my blog some years ago.
</p>

<p>
	Martin's problem is that he's still not really understanding what science is and its limitations. He's still trying to demystify and rationalize everything -- as scientists are trained to do.

<p>
	You guys are being sloppy with your Spiral assessments.
</p>

<p>
	All you have to do is read Goop.com's About page to clearly see they are promoting Green values:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://goop.com/whats-goop/" rel="external nofollow">https://goop.com/whats-goop/</a>
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			"Our Values:
		</p>

		<p>
			We believe that the little things count, that good food is the foundation of love and wellness, that the mind/body/spirit is inextricably linked and we have more control over how we express our health than we currently understand, that it’s better to buy fewer things that are better."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	An Orange person would never write that.
</p>

<p>
	The name of the company alone screams out Green. No Orange person is gonna name their company Goop.
</p>

<p>
	The reason Goop is ridiculed in mainstream media is precisely because it is too Green relative to the Orange center of gravity of mainstream culture.

<title>Isn't nonduality just another paradigm?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/25283-isnt-nonduality-just-another-paradigm/?do=findComment&amp;comment=283666</link>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	That's the kicker!
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is not a paradigm. If it were, it would be duality, not nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	You are making the mistake of confusing the map for the territory.
</p>

<p>
	Just consider: for there to be a paradigm at all, there must exist something prior to the paradigm -- the substrate so to speak -- which itself is not a paradigm. That substrate must be inaccessible via thoughts because thoughts themselves are a 2nd order phenomena of the substrate.
</p>

<p>
	Paradigms only occur at the level of thought. A paradigm IS a collection of thoughts. No thought, no paradigms. You can stop thinking an reality will still continue. But all paradigms will be destroyed.

Truth is not a matter of probability.
</p>

<p>
	Nor is the issue of evidence relevant because God is prior to the epistemic possibility of evidence or even human perception.
</p>

<p>
	I understand your skepticism. It feels justified and "scientific", but when it comes to consciousness of the ultimate origin of existence, it just won't cut it. Skepticism is a fear-based reaction of the ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that atheists hold the belief that atheism is not a belief. But if you introspect, you can become conscious that it is a belief.

</p>

<p>
	Both are misguided beliefs. Both are closedminded beyond help in most cases. Both are egotistical.
</p>

<p>
	Atheism NOT a lack of belief. It is just a negative belief. The belief is obviously there if the atheist just bothers to introspect self-honestly.
</p>

<p>
	Atheists believe that God is absurd, irrational, impossible, imaginary, and unscientific. An opiate of the masses.

<p>
	I didn't say JP is Hitler. I used those extreme examples to illustrate that merely having a life purpose is not automatically a good thing. The details matter.
</p>

<p>
	Passion and intelligence are a double-edged sword. You can be smart, passionate, and wrong or pathological.
</p>

<p>
	When intelligent or passionate people are wrong, they tend to get really stuck in it.
</p>

<p>
	JP has some good teachings, just be mindful that they are a Trojan horse for stage Blue/Orange conservative political ideology. Which is what made him so popular. Without the Trojan horse you would not know who he is.

I'm not sure what the causes of that were for you. It could of have been egoic resistance to living up to your full potential, or it could have just been that it wasn't your true passion.
</p>

<p>
	There are various solutions. Personal development and spiritual inner work is usually the answer for dissolving egoic resistances.
</p>

<p>
	I still have resistance to following my life purpose after 5 years. It's not easy to be at the cutting edge of your potential. Sometimes you just gotta act despite the fear and excuses.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you shouldn't physically overwork yourself. Try not to work more than 40-60 hours per week, otherwise it becomes unsustainable.

Finite resources still must be distributed in some way.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot escape the game of survival unless you are physically dead.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment alone does not resolve the finite resource distribution problem. Better systems must be invented for that and they will never be perfect enough to give everyone the resources they need to survive. So fighting will always take place if you care about living. If you don't care about living, then you have the option to physically die without putting up a fight.

Therein lies the whole trick of God. You cannot communicate it. Absolute Truth is outside the realm of proof, reason, thought, or speech. So talking about it is pointless. The problem is that someone like Matt Dillahunty does not understand why Truth must be incommunicable. Absolute Truth is non-symbolic.
</p>

<p>
	Atheism is like a religion. You cannot reason with it because its premises are not grounded in reason but in faith. Of course the irony is that all atheists will vehemently deny it. Which is why they cannot be reasoned with.
</p>

<p>
	The only way Matt will realize he is wrong is by going through the radical existential crisis called enlightenment. But of course his whole game is to avoid enlightenment. Which is why he's an atheist to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	See how sneaky the mind is?
</p>

<p>
	The Truth cannot penetrate a recalcitrant mind.

	To an almost total extent. Nearly 100%

<p>
	As psychedelics clearly demonstrate.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with neurofeedback is that it's too expensive and complex for most people.
</p>

<p>
	I've done lots of neurofeedback on myself and it's pretty powerful.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the better option money-wise. And they are also more powerful.

<p>
	That's what relative means.
</p>

<p>
	You are judging the relative from the Absolute. Which isn't relative, but Absolute. Which is actually relative because the Absolute doesn't judge anything or limit anything, including the relative.
</p>

<p>
	To not make room for the relative truth will lead to all sorts of foolishness, so watch out.
</p>

<p>
	When the cop stops you for speeding, you will not be able to get away by saying, "But in the Absolute sense there is no right and wrong." In the relative domain, might makes right. Survival rules the day. You can choose to disregard the relative domain, but you will not survive long, so before you make that choice, make sure you're okay with death.

That's all just a game.
</p>

<p>
	Mostly I just care about putting forth my ideas. I've got enough ideas to share for years to come. Doing collabs just tends to dilute my work because I find few popular figures thinking at the integral level I like thinking at.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that the most popular public intellectuals are rather crude, un-integral, closedminded, and ideological in their approach. Which is precisely why they became popular. And precisely why I don't want to have much to do with them.
</p>

<p>
	A discussion with Joe Rogan would be one exception. He and I could have a deep discussion.
</p>

<p>
	The kind of stuff I like to talk about is never ever going to go mainstream.

</p>

<p>
	There are tons of lunatics in society with a firm sense of life purpose. Doesn't make it a conscious or good thing. There can be healthy life purpose and pathological life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	JP can believe whatever he wants, but the problem is that his ideology is radicalizing people and misinforming them about post-modernism and stage Green. This is actually a big problem, as you can see just by reading the YT comments that JP fans make. Their understanding of these issues is extremely polarized, unsophisticated, egocentric, and naive.
</p>

<p>
	Part of the problem is that these are young directionless males, age 18-26 who are still very immature, naive, and lacking in compassion.
</p>

<p>
	You realize, right, that in the Middle East, terrorist groups recruit members using the exact same techniques JP is using? They target exactly the same age-range of males, and they radicalize them using cultural and identity issues, by demonizing stage Orange American decadence and liberalism. "How dare those liberal Americans let women drive, get a divorce, and walk around with their tits hanging out! What chaos! They are destroying the hierarchy of Allah! Letting gays have sex without killing them is ridiculous!"
</p>

<p>
	If JP was born in the Middle East, he would be railing against stage Orange Western secular capitalism and trying to build a theocracy.
</p>

<p>
	This has nothing to do with JP per se. It's just a Spiral mind virus. Minds work in predictable ways (to those who make a careful study of the workings of the mind).
</p>

	Ego is the idea that you were born.

<p>
	Ego is not a brain part. Ego is a thought. The thought that you are an individual who was born and is looking around at the world, and that it is important that you not die.

</p>

<p>
	You are conflating absolute and relative domains.
</p>

<p>
	The wage slavery video was not a nondual teaching. Be careful trying to push everything through the nondual strainer. This is the problem with too much Neo-Avaita style teachings. You turn understanding of reality into an over-simplified nondual flatland.
</p>

<p>
	Many of my videos put forth RELATIVE truths, not absolute ones.
</p>

<p>
	And of course there is no literal pyramid out in the world. This was a metaphor, a map. Obviously you shouldn't go out in the world looking for an actual pyramid. You will never find it. Just like you will never find "gravity" or "the United States Of America" or "cats" out in the world.
</p>

<p>
	See my recent blog video about All Understanding Is Metaphoric. You're still falling into the trap of literalism.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing I say is ever literally true. It's a pointer or a filter through which to look at the world in a useful way.

<p>
	Lol, of course ego-mind cannot be relativistic proper. Its job is to be self-biased. Survival, survival, survival.
</p>

<p>
	Relativism can only be actualized through deep awakening and dissolution of the ego.
</p>

<p>
	Then it is possible.
</p>

<p>
	That's how a Buddhist monk can set himself one fire.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is that everything is relative. But to accept this fully is tentamount to death. And only the wisest of human beings will surrender to this brutal truth.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Green post-modernists are not truly relativistic. They are phoney relativists. They have not actualized ontological relativism. They have turned relativism into a religion.
</p>

<p>
	Why is relativism so denied? Precisely because it is true. The ego cannot handle it.

<title>Perfect Stage Orange Example: Elon Musk Finally on Joe Rogan</title>

<p>
	Musk is definitely beyond pure Orange. He's got a lot of Green in him. He's clearly got a great environmental consciousness and concern for mankind and values love. This is not common in pure Orange people.
</p>

<p>
	Musk is a good example of a Greenish CEO.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bit hard to tell how much Yellow he has. Not enough info in the video to tell.

<p>
	This is fear.
</p>

<p>
	You wanna figure out what you are using this business/success to compensate for.
</p>

<p>
	What would happen if you lost your biz and never had success again in your life? What would be so wrong with that?
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate and try to face this fear. Realize it is something your ego is constructing as part of your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Why do you feel so insecure? What deeper truths are you avoiding with all this success-striving?

</p>

<p>
	In fact, your passion is no accident. It is there precisely so that you don't feel the need to pick up a book.
</p>

<p>
	I am not going to explain feminism or post-modernism to you on a forum because these are nuanced topics which entire books have been written about and which require years of study to understand properly. These are not conversations for online keyboard jockeys. These are serious intellectual pursuits.

<p>
	Of course, because you are just reacting to it from ego identity.
</p>

<p>
	That's your problem right there. It would be wise to actually do some reading and research before talking about feminism.
</p>

<p>
	I would bet that 98% of JP fan have not read a single feminist work. That is the whole appeal of JP: he offers and ideology with which to demonize and attack others without doing an serious research into their POV and why post-modernism arose in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	This whole JP fandom is rooted in lack of education.
</p>

<p>
	You must learn to take on other points of view, not just insist on your own being right. All POVs are partial and relative.
</p>

<p>
	That is the lesson of post-modernism which is being missed by JP fans. They do not give a rats ass about seriously exploring other POVs. Which requires reading and research.

He is definitely much more nuanced than a solid Blue person. Solid Blue is like Mike Pence or Jerry Falwell.
</p>

<p>
	Peterson is not a religious fundamentalist.
</p>

<p>
	He is very Orange with stripes of Blue and some hints of Yellow, and a big inflammed Green shadow.
</p>

<p>
	Yellow is generally in favor of more social engineering, not less. Yellow just wants to do it in an integral, Spiral conscious way, using a systems theory approach.
</p>

<p>
	All stages basically want to socially engineer society to fit their values. Yellow wants to socially engineer society to accomodate the entire Spiral, recognizing the value each stage offers and the need to help people grow through all stages up to Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Don Beck and his work trying to teach Spiral Dynamics to Israelis and Palestinians is the epitome of stage Yellow social engineering efforts. It's really eye opening to read about.
</p>

<p>
	My work to integrate science, spirituality, and Western philosophy is also very Yellow.
</p>

	Preaching to the choir here. These minds have already been throughly brainwashed by Actualized nondual propaganda.
</p>

<p>
	You should post this question on an Incel or PUA forum.
</p>

<p>
	KABOOOOM!

I wonder why?

<title>divine attributes of absolute infinity</title>

<p>
	A) God wants EVERYTHING! That's what infinity is: EVERYTHING! God includes all possible dualities, including good vs bad, open vs closed minded, love vs hate, order vs chaos, peace vs violence, etc. God necessarily incorporates all of it. That is God's Love with a capital L. Nothing is denied.
</p>

<p>
	B) I give a list of names for God from all mystical traditions in the video: Mystical Traditions Around The World.
</p>

<p>
	There are like over 100 names for God outside Islam.
</p>

<p>
	Speaking from a script is a totally different skillset from speaking off the cuff.
</p>

<p>
	Which skillset do you want? Practice that one.
</p>

<p>
	As a middle way you could practice speaking based off a PowerPoint outline, that way you have some basic notes, but not entire written out sentences.
</p>

<p>
	Speaking off the cuff is far more enjoyable and powerful. It is the harder skill to develop, but really worth it.
</p>
