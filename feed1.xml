</p>

<p>
	If you try to reduce meditation to numbers like that, you'll end up shooting yourself in the foot, as you will overlook the most important aspect: quality.
</p>

<p>
	10 minutes of quality meditation is worth more than 10 hours of poor meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Be very careful about pursuing consciousness mechanically or numerically.

			I don't know if you are strictly referring to humans here but according to Sadhguru, the human body is the peak of evolution given the current geometry of the solar system. If any more changes are to happen to the human system, it requires a change in the current geometry of the solar system. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Sorry, I don't buy that.
</p>

<p>
	As our environment changes due to technological advancements, the human will be less and less suitable and require further evolution. It's already happening. Natural selection is always culling those who aren't adapting to an ever changing environment. And our environment is changing faster than ever.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as the peak of evolution. Evolution is relative to environment. If you move to Mars, you ain't gonna be at your peak. And humans on Mars will evolve accordingly. The geometry of the solar system doesn't need to change for this to occur. Evolution never stops or peaks out. It is relentlessly ongoing every second of every day.

</p>

<p>
	But for that to work you have to be willing to open your mind beyond what you presently know. And you have to be willing to take such existential question as "Why is reality the way it is?" seriously.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe the question isn't worthwhile to contemplate, then you will get no answer and you will not even know what treasures you missed.
</p>

<p>
	It's like there's a pile of flawless diamonds buried under your bed but you are too incredulous to get a shovel and dig under your bed. I'm telling you guys there's a pile of diamonds here which you have not yet discovered.

Yes, I believe the enlightenment is the way to overcome this fear. I've started meditating 1 hour a day and i seem to be becoming more calm and focused than before. If i do this long enough, let's say 1 year, will it get me a taste of what enlightenment is like? What is the minimum requirement of meditation, self-inquiry, and trip for awakening? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is no formula for awakening. You will only awaken if you awaken. No process can guarantee it.
</p>

<p>
	Judging from my own experience, 1 hour per day is not nearly enough. But it's not a function of brute time, it's a function of effort and quality of concentration.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about awakening, you should be doing week-long meditation retreats at least twice a year. And/or psychedelics and/or Kriya yoga.
</p>

<p>
	That's all very natural. Students emulate teachers until they are finally ready to leave the nest and embark on their own. It might take 5 or 10 years for that to happen. But it will happen if you go deep enough into the work. You will become your own authority figure, grounded deeply in yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect that to happen in your 20's. Maybe around your mid-30's that will start to happen. It takes a long time for a man to find his grounding in life. It's a slow maturation process, like a finely aged wine.

<title>Leo What is your opinion on trip killers?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/37776-leo-what-is-your-opinion-on-trip-killers/?do=findComment&amp;comment=472735</link>

<p>
	I would not use them.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of the trip is to face whatever comes up.
</p>

<p>
	If your protocol is sound, you shouldn't need them.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, if you're the sort of person who might freak out and do something dangerous like jump off a 20 story balcony, then you might want to have some laying around.
</p>

<p>
	But even just having them around will change your trip. Your tripping will be sloppy because in the back of your mind you will know that if things get serious you can escape. This can lead you to second guessing yourself and treating tripping too lightly.
</p>

<p>
	There's an important aspect of tripping where you know that once you've taken the substance, that's it -- you're all in. There's no escape. This helps the surrender process. It also helps you to think twice before tripping because you understand the gravity of the situation. This is no toy or joke.
</p>

<p>
	I would rather not have an escape hatch. But that's me. You might be different.
</p>

<p>
	To me, a large part of the growth I get from tripping is the seriousness of it. It's not a toy to me. And of course I learned this lesson the hard way: by going through some rough trips in the beginning. But I'm glad I did.
</p>

	Inspiring story man! Keep rocking it. You're doing great for your age.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Your desire and intention for awakening & love is the most important thing. As long as you keep that desire stoked in your heart, you will find your way. It just won't be a linear path. Life will have all sorts of twists and turns in store for you.
</p>

<p>
	When you find something that's truly important to you in life, latch onto it like a python and don't let go until life relents and gives you what you most desire.
</p>

<p>
	The beginning is the hardest part. It will get easier.
</p>

<p>
	1) You can teach those things in most major US or European cities with no problem and plenty of eager customers.
</p>

<p>
	2) Remember, part of your job is to help uplift people who are not yet at Yellow. It's too easy to work with Yellow and above people. The real work is helping people get to Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, Jesus did not say: "Let me see which city I can move to to find the most advanced people." He worked with whoever was around. The whole point of being Yellow is that you're able to work with Tier 1 people.
</p>

<p>
	An angle doesn't say: "Let me find the richest, more elite, and most advanced people to help. Fuck the rest of em."
</p>

<p>
	As Yellow and above, part of your burden to bear is that you will be misunderstood a lot.

		</p>

		<p>
			My opinion is that 
		</p>

		<p>
			- government spending should be made more transparent (Ranging from 2-7% for now) 
		</p>

		<p>
			- taxing should be increased on large scale online companies that are soley online 
		</p>

		<p>
			- more funding should be given to the housing department for the projects 
		</p>

		<p>
			- the government should invest in renewable energy for blocks around poor areas , to lower their energy bills. (Bit too far fetched realistically) 
		</p>

		<p>
			- government should regulate Silicon Valley for their investments into tech start up firms 
		</p>

		<p>
			- government should start up their own research branch into fields of interest. Rather than letting the university lead. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I can actually think of 1000 different policies. But I’m asking more generally over the trade offs in areas of government than specific policies 
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Those are all generally good ideas. It's just a matter of sorting out the details and setting priorities.

<p>
	Actually, this is false!
</p>

<p>
	Experience is not experience. The very notion of experience is dualistic and corrupted by ego.
</p>

<p>
	There is truly no such thing as experience. What you consider experience is a conceptual fabrication. What's really there is not experience but Being. This is not just a semantic difference. On this hinges everything.
</p>

<p>
	Right now you are confused, mistaking Absolute Truth for this thing you invented and call "experience." In this way you are maintaining the fantasy that you were born. Your very life depends on not properly understanding what experience is.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind will not allow you understand what I am saying here. Because if you understood what I'm saying here your entire reality would collapse and you'd have a mental breakdown.
</p>

<p>
	You assume you are a biological creature inside a physical space having experiences. This is false. You have imagined: biology, space, time, experience, and your self.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is NOT a subjective experience. Enlightenment is the realization of Absolute Truth. At the moment of enlightenment you literally stop being a biological creature in a physical space. Because in that moment you realize that all of that is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You literally break out of "physical reality". For the first time you see reality as it truly is. You escape The Matrix.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that your whole life has been lived inside a cartoon. And then one day you realize: "OH MY GOD! I am just a cartoon character!!!!" This means that all of science was part of the cartoon. So you cannot use science at that point to ground yourself any more. You realize that science is a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate how radical this is. It is as serious as getting shot in the head. You are going to perceive it as extremely threatening.
</p>

<p>
	Evolution is not a done deal. It is happening every minute of every day.
</p>

<p>
	You have evolved a mind so you can figure out how to adapt to ever changing environments.
</p>

<p>
	Problems are always part of adapting to new environments. Nothing new about this.
</p>

<p>
	It is a problem in and of itself to deny that digital technology is a part of nature. We cannot go back to live in the woods. That would actually be a regression. We must find ways to integrate our technological developments and to make them the new "natural". This obviously needs to be done in a balanced and healthy way. But denying the digital realm is itself pathological.
</p>

<p>
	Powerful new technology requires consciousness to use in a healthy & harmonious way.

<p>
	Again, this is part true and part false.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "the natural way of doing things". Technology is always advancing. Technology is part of nature. You cannot undo technological advance. Digital reality will only grow stronger and stronger. VR socialization will soon be a big thing. Through VR socialization you will be able to make friends across the whole global, not just your local neighborhood. Digital actually allows us to transcend the limits of physicality. Think about it. That's why digital is to valuable. It's God-like.
</p>

<p>
	Socrates believed philosophy should not be written but only spoken because writing would corrupt the mind. Why did he believe this? Because writing was a new invention in his day and he was set in his ways.

</p>

<p>
	But then the pendulum swings to the opposite extreme where the spiritual seeker turns anti-intellectual, rejecting the mind entirely without realizing that God can speak directly through one's mind using thoughts, images, language, and even as entire manuscripts.
</p>

<p>
	Most people fail to appreciate that God knows all languages in the entire universe. God is using your mind to manifest itself. Since it is formless it needs a limited formed vehicle to express itself. Mind and speech is God.
</p>

<p>
	The only question is: How pure is the vehicle through which God speaks?
</p>

<p>
	How pure is your vehicle? How much is your ego getting in the way?

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	This thread contains a lot of people talking past one another. We have to be careful in how we define our terms and how we use different mental schemes to explain the unexplainable.
</p>

<p>
	I am not really contradicting Spira or Tolle. I'm just challenging folks here to see the other side of the coin: all thoughts happen now and only now.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that thoughts are so sneaky they mesmerize you into an illusory conceptual world. This is what is meant when people say that thoughts take you out of the now. They don't actually take you out of the now because now is all there is. But subjectively they entrance you. It's like getting lost in a day dream.
</p>

<p>
	Also want to challenge people here to not dismiss thoughts or mind as bad. The Absolute Now can certainly contain thoughts. Otherwise how could thoughts exist???
</p>

<p>
	Elimination of thought is not strictly necessary to be in the now. Newbies commonly get the wrong idea about thought and mind, as if it is an evil that must be eradicated. I wanted to challenge that.

<p>
	That is part true and part false.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately who is to say what is real and what isn't? We make up those definitions.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in person sociaizing is different. But as humanity evolves digital communication will become more and more common and robust. Even digital sex is getting common now.
</p>

<p>
	I've had deeper orgasms through text message than through physical sex. So don't dismiss the digital world as somehow inferior. It has its pros and cons, just like all mediums.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, physical reality is just one medium out of many. Digital reality is no less real than physical reality or imagination.

<title>Is a good period of high mood and excitement, must be followed by period of opposite</title>

<p>
	The whole point of true happiness is not to base it on mood.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being happy even when you're in a bad mood. That's real happiness. And it's not easy to develop because our ideas of happiness are so mood based and survival based. Those ideas require deep deconstruction. You have to deeply grok that attachments to physical things and even emotional states always create suffering -- sometimes gross suffering, but sometimes very subtle suffering.
</p>

<p>
	This was a core teaching of the Buddha. And it's a very important point which people overlook. Outwitting suffering is something only a master can do. Suffering is extremely sneaky! Because it's central to your survival. You must literally transcend the entire survival drive to access true happiness.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening allows for superhuman levels of happiness.
</p>

<p>
	Careful.
</p>

<p>
	I know extroverts who are awakened and do spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	And obviously many extroverts make a killing in creativity, business, art.
</p>

<p>
	There's more than one way to skin a cat.
</p>

<p>
	One should only be a lone wolf if that's what one is called to do. It's not necessary for success.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, personally I love lone wolfing life. But that's just me. People here must find whatever kind of lifestyle resonates with them. This is a highly individualized thing.

</p>

<p>
	You must awaken to what Love is to understand these discussions. We are not talking about romantic love here.
</p>

<p>
	This requires an epic enligthenment experience which will melt your cold heart.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate: What is Love?
</p>

<p>
	Hint #1: it is not what you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	Hint #2: psychedelics make this contemplation a lot easier.
</p>

<p>
	Those 5 insights are of course all true and very important to realize.
</p>

<p>
	But there's also a lot more stuff to realize.
</p>

<p>
	The "mechanics" of God are not addressed well by Buddhism.

<p>
	Because you are in a contracted state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Also, since Love is all things, it doesn't necessarily have to be felt. You don't have to like all aspects of reality. Hatred too is a form of love.
</p>

<p>
	Think about what "Everything is Love" entails. That means pain is love. It does not mean that you will never feel pain.

<p>
	The ultimate goal is to realize that there is no difference between form and formlessness.
</p>

<p>
	But to realize this requires surrender of attachment to form.
</p>

<p>
	So again, the entry fee of immortality is death.
</p>

<p>
	Immortality cannot be attained through physical means, it must be attained through spiritual realization. The problem of death is not a physical one the way materialists assume, it is a metaphysical one. You must realize that material reality is imaginary. That your own birth is imaginary. Then you will be free.

<p>
	That is not possible. All forms are impermanent.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that can be immortal is formlessness.
</p>

<p>
	So long as you are identified with any form whatsoever, you are mortal.
</p>

<p>
	Only a devil would claim that God is a selfish devil. So nice try, but no, don't confuse your devilry with that of God. If I let you, you would make a devil out God! See what a devil you are?! Hehe....

<p>

<p>
	It is the survival of any limited identity. Any identity attached to any kind of form. Any identity less than the entirely of reality.
</p>

<p>
	So, a kangaroo is committed to surviving as a kangaroo. This makes it selfish. You are commited to surviving as a human. This makes you selfish.
</p>

<p>
	If you weren't bothered by living or dying, you'd be selfless and immortal.
</p>

<p>
	The entry fee for immortality is death.

I'm not saying that's the end, but the beginning.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't what a mystical experience or a samadhi state is, take a psychedelic and they will quickly show you. Then try to get similar results via other methods.
</p>

<p>
	If you have meditated for a few years but never had a mystical experience or samadhi, then you aren't doing it properly or you need to find a better method.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedic to see how much you're meditation is missing.

<p>
	The point of enlightenment is to realize what death is.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot be explained to you in a believable way. You have to experience it to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	Until then you will of course fear death. Because you believe you are real.

<title>Is this what it means for reality to be groundless?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/37736-is-this-what-it-means-for-reality-to-be-groundless/?do=findComment&amp;comment=472269</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	No, that is not what groundless means.
</p>

<p>
	Groundless means that you can never say what the material substance of anything is because anything you claim to be the substance will itself need a further substance to explain it, and so on, to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	You can't claim the substance of any form to be another form, the way science tries to do. You cannot say that a table is made of atoms because the atoms themselves are just another form in an infinity of forms. You must grok that the substance of everything is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to say it is: a table is not made out of atoms. A table is a table. This is tricky to grasp because it is too direct to be grapsed. It is raw Truth/Being. A nondual state of consciousness is required to understand it.
</p>

	Science has made 5-MeO-DMT. What more do you want?
</p>

<p>
	The thing people don't understand about the immortality elixer is that it works by killing you! So the last thing a devil will do is drink it. The devil is terrified of meeting God. He is committed to staying a devil.

</p>

<p>
	Far more important is how you manage your life, regardless of where you are.
</p>

<p>
	As long as you're in a physically safe and free society, that's basically good enough. The real work then begins. The inner work.
</p>

<p>
	If you are in an oppressive violent country, then that is important to resolve.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Precisely because a devil is merely God in disguise! Really, there are no devils. A devil is just what we call it when God isn't aware that it's God.
</p>

<p>
	Also, devilry is inherently unstable and self-defeating. The suffering that devilry creates ultimately becomes so strong that the devil is forced to admit he is wrong. Either that or he doubles down and becomes an even bigger devil until finally physical death takes him.
</p>

<p>
	So now you see why death is such an important part of the divine plan of Love. Death is the safety valve which ensures that devils never ultimately prevail. A devil can only prevail in the short-term. God always prevails in the long-term: by killing you and freeing you of all your limits! Death is like the reboot button on your computer, for when it bugs out <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Could you imagine if devils lived forever? Now that would be a problem. Fortunately, <u>all devils must die</u>. Unfortunately, you are a devil. Fortunately, you are also God <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

	Say... that's a good book title <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	The profoundly twisted irony is this: the devil only behaves like a devil in the first place because he can die! If the devil was immortal he would not act like a devil, he would act like God! If a devil should ever realize that he is actually immortal, he will stop acting like a devil and start acting like God. Ta-da!

<p>
	To be more accurate, I just have a different kind of social life than most people consider a social life. My social life is through my work.
</p>

<p>
	For example you might ask if the Buddha or Gandhi had a social life. And the answer is, their social life was everything that revolved around their life's work. The same goes for me, except with the added wrinkle that we now live in the digital age, where the notion of "social" has expanded to include all of the activity happening through digital communication.
</p>

<p>
	If you include digital communication, my social life is quite significant.
</p>

<p>
	The very definition of "social life" is flexible and relative and changes across the ages.
</p>

<p>
	If you mean, do I go to the bar and drink beers with people, or attend dinner parties, or go bowling with friends? Definitely not. Such things are not interesting to me.
</p>

	He's using a very loose definition, something along the lines of: anyone who's ever be in a non-symbolic state. But that's very short of what I'm talking about.
</p>

<p>
	I don't consider Jeffery Martin enlightened. Not even close. He's still thoroughly materialistic in his explanations of reality & consciousness.

<p>
	To me, escaping suffering has never been the goal. The goal has always been understanding reality.
</p>

<p>
	You are right, most people pursue spirituality rather selfishly & narrow-mindedly -- to escape pain or improve their life.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest sages I think pursue it for understanding & Truth, not to escape something negative.

</p>

<p>

I tried most techniques I've found and the ones recommended by you (besides kriya yoga) I don't really have a preference I get results with most of them, I just need to "up" my practice, which I am shooting for in the near future. I also receive the results described, I've been mostly practicing mindfulness and do-nothing. Also a fair amount of people receive real results from shinzen techniques, most join after praticing other techniques for years and they don't sound deep and shinzens advice does not sound all to deep then, and they don't talk about jhanas, power releams, enlightenment stages or insights, but mostly some life relevant matter about practice.

<p>
	Shinzen's techniques are good. Will they get you to the deepest levels of understanding? Probably not. But that's okay, they don't need to. A toolbox needs more than one tool in it.
</p>

<p>
	Use Shinzen's techniques, but also don't stop there. Explore other things like psychedelics. I doubt you'll find a technique more powerful than 5-MeO-DMT. But that doesn't mean you should only use 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>
	It's hard to say. We don't have good science on this yet.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking good techniques to try are all the ones I've shared in the past:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Meditation
	</li>
	<li>
		Self-inquiry
	</li>
	<li>
		Strong determination sitting
	</li>
	<li>
		Contemplation
	</li>
	<li>
		Psychedelics
	</li>
	<li>
		Vipassana retreats
	</li>
	<li>
		Solo retreats
	</li>
	<li>
		Yoga
	</li>
	<li>
		Dark room retreats
	</li>
	<li>
		Shamanic breathing
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These are well-worn methods that work for many people.
</p>

<p>
	And in the end, you gotta wonder, is there any other option? Those are the best techniques mankind has developed so far. So you might as well start tinkering around with them. With practice you should find whatever works best for you.

	All of that is survival. You're still not appreciating what I mean by the notion of survival. It's a much deeper notion than most of you guys here yet realize.
</p>

<p>
	Rest, play, and showing affection is all part of survival. Without them a mammal would be dead.

<p>
	Animals don't meditate. You're projecting that onto them. They sit and do nothing sometimes. But I wouldn't call that meditation.

<p>
	I don't have a social life. Never cared to have one. It does not interest me.
</p>

<p>
	I rarely watch movies these days. Hard to find good movies. Most of them are juvenile superhero crap. Occasionally Hollywood makes a good movie for adults. But that's like twice a year. The rest is popcorn spectacles & money machines, which I don't care for.
</p>

<p>
	Occasionally I'll play a video game. When a good one comes out. But again, that's quite rare. Maybe once a year. I don't care for most games. It needs to be something original and deep or artistic.

<p>
	Certainly not all cities in Oregon. Rural parts of every state/country are basically Blue.
</p>

<p>
	NYC has some Green aspects but also a lot of Orange. Many of the top cities in the USA are Orange/Green hybrids, not fully Green. A fully Green city would be very hippy-ish. Something like Sedona AZ maybe.

	Technically no city has a single color. Each part of the city has its own color, so it's tricky because we're talking about loose averages.

			Will Absolute Love still be present when someone is experiencing a hell realm? If so, then maybe Reality is not just Absolute Love, but also Absolute Torture/Hatred? Maybe Absolute Love is just an insight from high experiences (relative to feeling good)?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's the mindfuck of it: even the worst hell realm is still Absolute Love. The person just isn't aware of it in that moment.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, it's a catch-22: the person is in the hell realm because their consciousness is in a limited state. That's what a hell realm is: a limited state of consciousness. A limited state is not wide enough to see the big picture. Seeing the big picture is necessary to understand that all states & realms are part of the flowering of Infinite Love. So from inside a hell realm it will seem like there is no love at all. But from outside the hell realm it is realized that that hell realm is indistinguishable from Love. If a person in the hell realm realized that it is Love, the hell realm would instantly transform into Paradise. But of course this is hard to do in practice because the hell realm so mesmerizes one's consciousness. It's like a bad dream. It's hard to break out when you're in it. But nor is it necessary to break out. What's more important is to realize that it isn't real.
</p>

<p>
	God's Love wouldn't be unlimited if it excluded hell realms. But the ego's POV is too limited to appreciate that. Luckily God has no such limitation.
</p>

<p>
	The duality or boundary between heaven & hell is itself made of Nothing/Love! Heaven is the realization that there is no difference between being in heaven or hell. The moment you realize the difference between the two is an imaginary duality, you will find yourself in Heaven. Heaven being an absolute -- has no opposite.
</p>

<p>
	Hell is the idea that there is a heaven separate from where you currently are -- and wishing to be there. The desire to be in heaven ironically produces hell because it is a denial and resistance of the present moment -- a denial of truth in favor of falsehood. So hell is falsehood or delusion. And Heaven is Truth.

<title>Who's Interested In Conscious Politics?</title>

<p>
	This video here shows her lack of political experience:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iw03B9sNikM?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Of course it's nice that's she's so open to changing her mind. But it also shows that she hasn't thought all her positions through.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get me wrong, I like her a lot. But success in politics requires more than being a spiritual guru. Spiritual gurus do not necessarily make the best politicians.
</p>

<p>
	Overall I'm thrilled that she's in the debates. She's helping elevate the political discourse which is what we badly need.
</p>

			Isn't the highest form of awakening realizing there is no difference between the ordinary world and enlightenment. Such that the goal isn't to be in a state where you are constantly g0d and never on autopilot, but to not see a difference in the two? As Daniel Ingram says mindfullness always waxes and wanes.

<p>
	There is no difference, but also there is.
</p>

<p>
	You are always in some state of consciousness. All states of consciousness are God, but you can only know that from certain states of consciousness. So your state of consciousness is absolutely important. You cannot be a donkey, for example. That is not an appropriate state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If Daniel Ingram was a donkey, his enlightenment would disappear and no amount of Buddhism would help him.

	The universe is structured in precisely such a way as to maximize Love. Every movement of every molecule and all the way up the chain of being is working towards this purpose. Including every pixel on this screen you're looking at and every character written on this forum.

<p>
	There is definitely a reason why reality is precisely how it is.
</p>

<p>
	To dismiss this as "mind" is to make one of the biggest mistakes possible: it is to never realize why you created reality.
</p>

<p>
	Rather a shame not to know that.

<p>
	Replace alcohol with psychdelics.
</p>

<p>
	The original cure for alcoholism via AA used LSD.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone forgot the LSD! Now it's all talk and no mysticism.
</p>

<p>
	The founder of AA used LSD to heal himself.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Nothing wrong with AA. But understand that your problems go deeper than talk can fix.

<p>
	In practice no. We usually use that word "enlightenment" quite sloppily to designate any degree of nondual realization. Often times the degree of it is minor and narrow.
</p>

<p>
	Many people who are conventionally called "enlightened" do not understand all of those 5 points I mentioned. And there are more points besides those 5.
</p>

<p>
	Binary designations are very misleading. You should always wonder: To what degree is this guy enlightened? What does he really understand? What specifically has he become conscious of?
</p>

<p>
	It's like if someone told you he's doctor. Okay, but that doesn't say much. What really matters is, How good of a doctor is he? Not all doctors are the same.

<p>
	They are not immersed in God-consciousness. They are immersed is mindless survival and selfishness, as are most humans. They are totally clueless about God even though of course they are God all along. But they don't know that, and that's what matters: knowing it.

<p>
	The divine plan is Love.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is understanding what that means.
</p>

<p>
	You would require infinite intelligence and selflessness to understand the plan. The plan is so grand that the ego literally cannot understand it.

	All why questions ultimately lead to the question of Why is reality precisely the way it is? And the answer to that is: Absolute Love.
</p>

<p>
	Feynman was going in the right direction, but he did not go far enough, deep enough, wide enough to understand the ultimate WHY.

<p>
	Of course they are very present, because they got no higher mind.
</p>

<p>
	They are pre-ego. Enlightened humans are post-ego. It's not the same thing. Your cat may be very present and pure, but he is not conscious that he is God. Whereas as a human can be. It is not enough to just be present. One must realize that he is God.
</p>

<p>
	An imbecile can be very present. That doesn't equate to metaphysical insight.
</p>

<p>
	You can do a frontal lobotomy on a human and he will become very passive and mindless like a cow. But that isn't God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	The point of all this work is not be present, it's to understand what reality is. If you're not crystal clear about what reality is and why reality is, then you've got more work to do.

</p>

<p>
	Assuming normal tolerance, I would stay under 4g of mushrooms and under 300ug of LSD. Even those doses can be very intense and challenging on the psyche to integrate.
</p>

<p>
	If I do mushrooms or LSD, I keep it at 2g and 150ug. But I'm probably unusually sensitive. Many folks would probably need to double or triple that to experience what I experience.

<p>
	Of course technically I don't. I can't crawl inside their heads.
</p>

<p>
	But one can still make educated deductions.
</p>

<p>
	When an enlightened person is not able to properly answer questions about the nature of Love or Truth, that's a red flag. If Love or Truth are denied, something in their understanding is missing.
</p>

<p>
	To me the highest teaching is very simple:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		You are God.
	</li>
	<li>
		Infinite Consciousness is the only thing that exists.
	</li>
	<li>
		Everything is imaginary.
	</li>
	<li>
		Everything is designed for the sake of Absolute Love.
	</li>
	<li>
		Truth & Love are totally identical.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Any teaching which does not state the above in clear & explicit terms, I am suspicious of. There are further nuances, but that's the core of spirituality/awakening.
</p>

<title>The 5-MeO-DMT Mega-Thread</title>

Don't underestimate them.
</p>

<p>
	When you want to transition to 5-MeO is all up to you. There is no rush. But be careful with high doses of LSD and mushrooms. They can get really hairy. I would stick to medium doses at most.
</p>

<p>
	It's very important that you don't spook yourself off with one bad trip. A lot of newbies get spooked off because their doses are too high and they are unable to deal with the truths which are shown them. So they end up sweeping the entire field of psychedelics away under the rug. It's a form of denial.
</p>

<p>
	The wisest course of action is to proceed slowly, moderately, carefully, patiently, yet persistently and methodicly. Tortoise wins the race in the end. Aim for 50 to 100 trips before you start to get the hang of psychedelics. Anything less than that is noob-land.

<p>
	I'm still telling you that brains are imaginary, as are neurotransmitters. The word "neurotransmitter" is being used here in a relative, imaginary sense.
</p>

<p>
	It's not the neurotransmitters I trust, but the Truth which they help to unveil.
</p>

<p>
	If you were stuck in jail cell inside a dream and I told you to use the key to unlock the door, the key is still imaginary. An imaginary door requires an imaginary key. It would be foolish to reply to me, "Haha, Leo! If this is all a dream like you said, why are you telling me to use this key? Why do you trust the key?"
</p>

<p>
	When inside The Matrix, we speak in the relative truths of The Matrix world. One of those relative truths is brains and neurotransmitters. Once you've taken the neurotransmitters you'll realize neurotransmitters and brains are imaginary. But only AFTER you take them!

	No they can't. If they could the whole world would be enlightened by now.

	It's almost the opposite. No matter what a master does he will not enlighten you. That method of teaching is too indirect and crude.

	Reality is too massive to have it make sense all at once. You gotta eat the elephant one bit at a time until you realize, "Oh, that was leg, that was an ear, that was a tail."
</p>

<p>
	The perfect place to begin eating it is anywhere. Just trust that over the months and years you'll see patterns emerge.
</p>

<p>
	If Actualized.org is not comprehensive enough for ya, nothing will be. It's so comprehensive it will take you a decade to realize how comprehensive it is. That's not a mistake.
</p>

<p>
	One day you will realize: "Holy fuck this is HUGE! How is this even possible?" <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<p>
	LOL
</p>

<p>
	Yes! There is INSIGHT and UNDERSTANDING.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot reduce those two to anything more fundamental.
</p>

<p>
	You must have an insight into what insight is. You do not understand what understanding is. Just notice that.
</p>

<p>
	This requires serious contemplation. It will not be explained to you in words.
</p>

<p>
	With deep enough insight you will realize that perception isn't even a thing. Perception is actually Being/Truth. "Perception" is a dualiatic notion, so be careful with just throwing that word around.
</p>

<p>
	A good way to contemplate what insight is, is to bring to mind specific examples of insight. For example, an insight was necessary for you to realize that whole numbers go up to infinity. At some point when you were a child you started counting: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... and then at some piont it hit you: This can go on forever!!! That was an insight.
</p>

<p>
	Insights are often quite ordinary.
</p>

<p>
	I remember vividly when I was a kid the moment when I realized why a penis gets hard. It was a massive epiphany: "Oh, it needs to be hard to fit inside a hole!!! Wow! Of course!"
</p>

<p>
	That was quite an insight! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Nothing is obvious until you have an insight about it.
</p>

<p>
	Your birth was an insight. One day you had the insight: "Oh, I exist!" And on that day you came into being as a human.
</p>

<p>
	Insight is a mysterious thing. Which is why we call this mysticism.
</p>

			Leo, I understand this argument. It makes total sense. But when it comes to spiritual attunement and awakening, we are not talking about different species. What you extrapolate from the calculus example makes sense in the context of a donkey and a human's ability to learn math. Obviously, there are different. You can't find even one donkey who can do calculus. But within human beings, there is a vast degree of success in awakening.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Some people's reality and consciousness is so radically different they might as well be another species. You guys are underestimating just how radically different consciousness can be for humans. This is a common oversight because humans looks similar from outside appearances. But as you've been told, don't judge a book by its cover. This is what's happening with humans. Most humans simply assume that all humans are like them. This is a bad assumption unsupported by science, evolution, medicine, genetics, or other facts.
</p>

<p>
	It's as if you walk into a book store and treat all the books the same just because they are books. But there are huge differences between books even though they have a similar form. That similarity is superficial when you really dig into them.
</p>

<p>
	Some humans are like that donkey, they will never attain enlightenment. The reasons for this are nuanced and complex. Motivation is part of the equation. Most people do not have the motivation to do it. You cannot dismiss motivation as part of the "talent". Motivation is a huge factor. You cannot just train someone to be motivated about Truth. Yes, training helps, but there's much more to it than training. And who you can train also depends on who they are. Many people are untrainable.
</p>

<p>
	There is no reason whatsoever that all humans should be equally spiritually capable given how evolution works. The difference between a human and a donkey doesn't really exist. Brains evolve to become more and more capable of insight. There is no such thing as "a human brain" vs "a donkey brain". There is an infinite spectrum of brain structure -- from worms to aliens -- which allows for greater and greater insight capacity.

			His insight into perception and sensory experience is problematic, sure! But he can do 4 hours of SDS sits weeks in a row. And that was decades ago. He had stream entry only 4 years into the training. The permanent deal. Someone can easily say this is because he was spiritually talented but I don't think brushing off training is the correct mindset here.

<p>
	I don't downplay any of that. That's all good and important.
</p>

<p>

	Nowhere near 0.1% of the population is awake. It's way lower than that. And when it comes to truly understanding the deep structures of God, it's less than 0.0001%.

<p>
	It's more important in spirituality than in getting women.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously if you look like Quasimodo that affects your chances attracting women. Although still not impossible.

<p>
	My biggest concern with the Red/Black Pill guys is that they use genetics as an excuse to not even try. They turn it into an egotistical ideology. Obviously I'm not saying that with spirituality. I'm not making some argument here about how you cannot realize God. I'm just saying your physiology plays an important role. So alter your physiology, alter your neurotransmitters!

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, you ARE still limited as long as you have a human body.
</p>

<p>
	But, that doesn't mean you can't access the Absolute. You can. You can access it deeper and deeper levels and facets. Degrees of depth here do not contradict each other, rather they build on top of each other. It's like this: you can learn some math, it will be valid math, but that doesn't mean you've exhausted your understanding of math. Math goes very deep. As you go deeper into it, the old math is still valid. So in this way you are accessing Truth but you have not exhausted Truth, because Truth is infinite. Your understanding of math can deepen forever.

I know that some people are very nihilistic and don't get so excited as you do, they simply have a totally different personality than you and no matter how amazing thing they will experience it will always seem dull when they talk about it. How an individual reacts and what conclusions he draws from the experience of God varies quite a bit.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's hard to articulate that here for you. I have had extensive hour-long conversations with Shinzen, asking him all sorts of nuanced metaphysical questions and his replies did not fully satisfy me. I see him as having gaps in his understanding. For example, he does not hold that enlightenment is Absolute Truth. He still hangs on to aspects of materialism, holding enlightenment as a subjective thing. I do not think he understands what Truth or Consciousness really is. I also don't think he understandings what Love really is.

<p>
	If you think about it for a moment you should quickly realize that it must be possible to lose enlightenment because otherwise humans could not exist. To be human God MUST be able to lose awareness of itself as God. This is how you were born. And no matter how enlightened you get, you will eventually lose it in order to incarnate as a tree, worm, bird, human, alien, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You already have direct experience of being unawakened. How did you get there? Only one way: by losing your awakening. Everyone has lost their awakening, even the most enlightened people including Buddha and Jesus. Otherwise they could not awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is only possible because of unawakening.

<p>
	Nothing I said contradicts that. I never said he denies siddhis. I'm not just talking about siddhis in this thread.
</p>

<p>
	Trying some psychedelics doesn't mean much. It's a question of what one has become conscious of using them. Lots of people have tried psychedelics and have little understanding to show for it.
</p>

<p>
	My claim is not merely that Shinzen doesn't have all the possible siddihis. My claim is that his understanding of Truth itself is incomplete. He's not wrong, but it's not the deepest level. I'm  not contradicting him, I'm just saying there's deeper understanding, deeper insight, deep consciousness.

			Leo, I'm curious to know, how will this help you? Especially what you said on the last paragraph. If the consciousness is so "radical," how will this help?

<p>
	How it will help is a question of survival. That's not my interest. My interest is understanding reality for its own sake. Whether it helps or hurts is irrelevant to me. The Truth is whatever it is regardless of how it effects you.

			Most of all, in one of your blog videos, you were saying that Shinzen Young's and Peter Ralston's enlightenment isn't that deep? Did they tell you exactly? No? Well, how deep do you want it? Don't they all point to the same thing after a certain point? Any form of "everythingness" that you see in your trips is still everythingness. To me, you don't know how deep are their enlightenment.

<p>
	The deeper one goes, the clearer it becomes who has and who hasn't gone that deep.
</p>

<p>
	The things I've realized cannot be put into words in any way whatsoever nor taught in any way whatsoever. And yet I can intuit that Shinzen Young and Ralston have not realized what I have realized. If that sounds arrogant to you, I understand. But it is what it is from my POV.
</p>

<p>
	Shinzen doesn't understand Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston doesn't understand Love.
</p>

<p>
	To me, those are important oversights. I would not be satisfied missing either of those understandings.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously these are my understandings of their attainments. I could be wrong. I'm not saying you should believe me. I'm just stating my best understanding of the situation at this time. Certain things they have told me do not square up with my deepest realizations. And I will doubt all teachers before I doubt my own deepest realizations.
</p>

<p>
	If the choice comes down to trusting 5-MeO-DMT and DPT vs trusting Shinzen and Ralston, I will trust the neurotransmitters. And no, that is not materialism. Direct consciousness is king, and that's what the right neurotransmitters facilitate. No human teacher can take you that deep. All human teachers and teachings are to be questioned and doubted. Including of course myself.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Nothing I said here should be used to entrench a victim mentality. Keep two things distinct in your mind: 1) the actual mechanics of how humans awaken, 2) any stories you come up with for why you cannot awaken and why should give up or not even try. I am talking about #1 in this thread. #2 is self-deception you gotta be very careful with.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to genetics and physiology you gotta make the best of the hand you've been dealt. Playing a victim is not a smart move regardless of how bad your hand is.

<p>
	If it helps you good. But it is not required for all people as Martin likes to declare.
</p>

<p>
	My point is that people have different requirements in their awakening process. It all depends on how your mind works.
</p>

<p>
	If something works for you, great. But be careful declaring that it will work for everyone or have importance for everyone or be necessary for everyone or is "the one and only true way."

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Since the universe is consciousness, consciousness is capable of self-understanding and insight into the truth of things.
</p>

<p>
	God is able to recognize itself and this ability is present all throughout everyday life, science, and thought. Yes, thoughts can be tricky, but thoughts also can contain kernels of truth. How is that possible? Because the powr of insight is baked into language. Language is not just a bunch of scribbles on a page. Language is made sense of or understood by a much more profound quality of the universe.
</p>

<p>
	Perception is not the only game in town. The universe doesn't just perceive, is can also understand.
</p>

<p>
	Understanding is how you're able to make sense of the things I say and see the truth or falsehood in various sayings. But it goes deeper than language. You can understand how to turn on a faucet. What do you think that is? Don't take that for granted! You could not turn on a facucet without some level of true understanding.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It means that once you become conscious of the Absolute, don't then fall back into doubting it.
</p>

<p>
	Like: "Well, was that really God? Maybe I'm not God after all? Maybe I was just hallucinating?"
</p>

<p>
	No! You are God! Stop doubting that. Don't make doubt your God. That would be putting the cart before the horse.

<p>
	Psychedelics do not cause mental illness. This is mostly fearmongering.
</p>

<p>
	If you have an existing mental illness perhaps psychedics can make it worse. Perhaps. But they could also cure it.

			"If you, the reader, were to take away only one piece of advice from this entire book, it would be this: Bilateral symmetry is the key. It is the most important feature of nondual energetic therapy with psychedelics, 5-MeO-DMT or otherwise. If you are not working with bilateral symmetry, then you are not doing the actual work. It is just that simple. Anything other than bilateral symmetry is ego. This is a universal and consistent truth – no matter how big, how powerful, or how meaningful you take your experience to be – if you’re not in symmetry, you’re doing something other than the real work of nondual activation, and you are guaranteed that your ego is involved and running the show." ~ Martin Ball

<p>
	In my experience the symmetry is not relevant much.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, you don't want to be all twisted up, but requiring some symmetry to realize God is ego itself.

<p>
	Why?
</p>

<p>
	You have to consider than even with your difficulties you might still be way ahead of most people on the planet.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you struggle with learning calculus doesn't mean you don't have a massive leg up on a donkey trying to learn calculus.
</p>

<p>
	Being talented or gifted doesn't mean life is easy. Probelms and challenges are always relative, so no matter how capable you are you will face challenges which will bend you to your limit.
</p>

<p>
	A donkey can carry 1000 lbs on his back before it breaks, you cannot. The donkey has you beat there. The donkey might look at you struggling to carry 200 lbs and laugh to himself, "What a whim!" But if you put 2000 lbs on the donkey his back will break. So the donkey is not free of struggle. Donkeys get more loaded up because they are expected to carry more than humans.
</p>

<p>
	If you observe nature carefully you will see that every physiological structure has its strengths, weaknessess, and breaking points. That is the nature of form. Every form has its limits.
</p>

<p>
	Form also always comes at the cost of flexibility. The more formed you are, the less flexible you are. Only God itself has infinite flexibility.
</p>

<p>
	Think of an object which is infinitely flexible. That's God! Ta-da! Notice, it must have no form.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but it explains things better because over 50 lives a lot of difference between people can accumulate. It shows you that there may be levels of development or consciousness that you simply won't realistically be able to reach in one life.
</p>

<p>
	For example, wouldn't it be valuable to know that it took the Buddha 50 lives to reach his level whereas you're on life #3 right now? So, like, don't beat yourself up if you can't actualize his results.
</p>

<p>
	And even so genetics and physiology are still a factor. You have to account for why humans are more conscious than kangaroos and worms.
</p>

<p>
	There must be a spectrum of spiritual ability which goes from worms to lizards to kangaroos to chimps to humans and far beyond. Humans cannot be at the top. Not even close! There must exist much more conscious beings than humans.
</p>

<p>
	No, it can't.
</p>

<p>
	Siblings are often raised in similar environments by similar parents and teachers yet they can come out very differently.
</p>

<p>
	One of the greatest unsolved mysteries of developmental psychology and spirituality is why some children and young adults advance through the stages so much faster than others. Practice and environment are certainly factors, but not the most important factor.
</p>

<p>
	Past lives are a good explanation here.
</p>

<p>
	Most people do not even care about metaphysics. Just to care about metaphysics already requires a certain type of mind/personality. I have cared about metaphysics from the very beginning. Without that, I would be just some regular dude flipping burgers at McDonalds. I'm not a gifted meditator but my metaphysical curiosity is through the roof and came built into my brain from birth. I did nothing to deserve it. At least in this life. Maybe I did something in a past life to earn it. I dunno. Or maybe I just won the genetic lottery. Out of 7 billion humans, surely some will be born will exceptional metaphysical curiosity. Humans are not minted in a factory like widgets. We have unique gifts.
</p>

<p>
	It's important that we be honest and acknowledge any gifts we may have. We also have unique weaknesses.

<p>
	If you think the Buddha was a just your average guy off the street, you're really misdiagnosing how spirituality works.
</p>

<p>
	It takes an exceptional person to do what the Buddha did. What that means exactly is a mystery, but something special and extraordinary is happening on the inside.
</p>

<p>
	Past lives might be a better explanation. Whatever the explanation, it's not merely lack of effort or training.
</p>

<p>
	I want you to start noticing that people's brains and minds work is very different ways. We are not all the same. Some people think very differently by their natural constitution. Some constitutions are more suitable to spiritual work than others. Just observe people carefully and you'll notice the differences in how they think and see the world. It's quite stark and obvious. People do not see the world in the same way. It would be better to say: people live in different realities with some overlap.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritually gifted folk. You can meet them in various spiritual circles. Healers, psychics, masters, yogis, sages, prodigies, shamans, witches, channelers, saints, etc.

<p>
	It's a combination of factors: diligence, discipline, willpower, passion, focus ability, existential curiosity, openmindedness, baseline level of consciousness, appropriate personality type, and more.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, it's much easier to stick with a technique when is produces immediate significant results. Some people sit down to meditate and start having mystical experiences within days or weeks. This of course makes it much easier to stick with the habit compared to a person who meditates for 3 years and doesn't have a single mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	I've met people who've sat down for one weekend, did 2 days of self-inquiry and awakened. That's totally unusual results. The average person can self-inquiry for 5 years and still not awaken.
</p>

<p>
	And it has to be this way. Otherwise half the people on the planet would be awake, but less than 0.0001% are. So you need some explanation for why that is. The explanation cannot just be that they're lazy or uninformed.

<p>
	That's very humbling to realize. Yes, consciousness is capable of experiencing intense suffering. By experiencing some of that yourself you become more compassionate, loving, tolerant, and understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Try to imagine what it's like to live as a little child in Syria whose entire family was killed in a bombing. Yeah... that's some hardcore suffering and it goes on around the world by the millions every day. Makes you appreciate how good you have it in this life.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are totally ignorant of who deeply humans can suffer. Which makes those people arrogant and callous. Only through deeply suffering themselves will they come to realize their callousness and arrogance.
</p>

<p>
	4-AcO-DMT is a very powerful substance. Be careful with it.

<p>
	They certainly take you beyond what would be natural for most humans. Of course even then there are still limits to what the body/mind can handle. Even the strongest psychedelic does not totally free you of human form.
</p>

<p>
	Some humans are like naturally high all the time because their brain chemistry is that way. This is quite rare, but still, not that rare. You can find such people.

<p>
	They probably are somewhat gifted. But also, the psychedelic catalyses that by 100x-1000x. Which would be hard to do any other way.
</p>

<p>
	A psychedelic is similar to Jesus spending 40 days in the desert with no food or the Buddha sitting under the tree for 2 weeks straight without moving. Only it happens much faster and easier, not requiring so much suffering.

<p>
	Sidhhis do not remove all limits. Many limits still exist even if you are Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	It's very much like Neo in The Matrix. He learns to bend some of the rules but he is still constrained inside The Matrix. There are still many things he cannot do.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The key is how you understand the word "self". That's an extremely loaded word.
</p>

<p>
	If Self is understood in the widest possible sense as God, then all of life is self-imposed and self-created. But that does not mean you as a human body are not bound by constraints. You as God have imposed constraints on yourself which you do not know how to undo without physical death.
</p>

<p>
	For example, God constrained itself to be that bird, but that bird has no idea how to break the constraints of bird-ness. That is the whole point of death, to escape one's self-imposed constraints. But you can't have it both ways. You can't be alive in a body yet totally unconstrained. The body is a serious constraint. Life itself is a constraint. All form is limited, whether you're a rock, a tree, a bird, a kangaroo, Albert Einstein, Jesus, a DMT machine elf, or whatever. Whatever you are is what constrains you to be less than infinite.
</p>

<p>
	You are lost in the labyrinth of your own consciousness and your only escape is death.
</p>

<p>
	Is a bird outside in nature free or not?
</p>

<p>
	Seems free, but it is also extremely limited.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to understand the limits of a bird. It would be madness to try to ask the bird to solve calculus equations. Likewise it would be madness to try to ask a human to hatch an egg.
</p>

<p>
	An important part of growing up is learning your limits. Paradoxically acknowledging one's limits can be liberating, as one then surrenders to them and stops trying to act in some loftier, idealized way.
</p>

<p>
	Telling a child who's not suited for math to be good at math would traumatize the child and ruin his self-esteem because he will always feels inferior and not understand why. He will then blame himself for being defective or inadequate when in fact he's just suited to other things.
