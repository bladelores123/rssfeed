</p>

<p>
	Human development tends to be very lopsided.
</p>

<p>
	You can have an enlightened person with poor social skills and who is a horny dog who molests his students. Or he could be a sociopath who starts a cult.
</p>

<p>
	You could have an enlightened person who thinks all religons except Christianity are wrong.

<p>
	Actually mostly the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	The percentage of the population who are at a stage of development where they can pursue enlightenment is extremely low.
</p>

<p>
	Most people will require 10-20 years of ordinary personal dev work before they can seriously pursue enlightenment. Because they are not ripe for it.
</p>

<p>
	I am not a strict enlightenment teacher, and Actualized.org's goals go way beyond what people like Tolle or Mooji or Ramana taught.
</p>

<p>
	We have a much broader scope here, attempting to understand all dimensions of life: sexual, political, social, emotional, physical, philosophical, scientific, astral, religious, linguistic, motivational, business, leadership, ecology, art, etc.
</p>

<p>
	We do not stop or start with nonduality.

<p>
	Do not confuse enlightenment for development.
</p>

<p>
	You can be enlightened but still at a crude, ethnocentric level of development, or at a crude level of moral, emotional, sexual, or political developement.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	By that logic we should not teach children math, or train dogs not to piss indoors, or teach anyone nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	If their karma is right, all of those things will happen spontaneously.
</p>

<p>
	-----
</p>

<p>
	Be careful how you apply your absolute insights in the relative domain. Or such absurdities as above will result.
</p>

<p>
	To teach nonduality without shadow work is downright irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
	Every serious spiritual tradition has strong injunctions against Zen devilry. Making a better world is part of the package, not optional.

<p>
	Your approach is way too simplistic.

<p>
	That is a huge mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Shadow work is central to spiritual work. Without it, you will become a Zen devil.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber is beyond what most people here can fathom.
</p>

<p>
	Underestimate teachers at your own peril.

<p>
	You gotta appreciate that 99.9% of people are not advanced or wise enough to do such things. They need someone to hold their hand and guide them to it.

<p>
	No, it is for understanding and predicting people's behaviors.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I know the Amazing Atheist will deny enlightenment so that's useful for me to know. Saves me lots of time.
</p>

<p>
	I know Trump will be a terrible Red President so I don't vote for him.
</p>

<p>
	I know Jordan Peterson is just reacting against Green so I don't get tricked by his sophistry.
</p>

<p>
	I can identify teachers who are Turquoise who I can learn lots from.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.

Their base may revolt and who knows if Owen will be willing to accept that.
</p>

<p>
	I have heard RSD instructors refer to the RSD inner circle as "North Korea". So I would not hold my breath.
</p>

<p>
	Before I started Actualized back in 2013 I approached Owen to maybe work together, but I saw that he was just not willing to grow beyond the sex and pickup as fast as I wanted so I decided to do my own thing. My vision was RSD minus the pussy chasing and materialism. Actualized.org is what I wished RSD was but wasn't. So I created it.

<p>
	Ego isn't capable of true love.
</p>

<p>
	The way to love everyone is to eliminate the ego.
</p>

<p>
	So love is just the side-effect of the work.
</p>

<p>
	This is why religious people are never capable of true love. They always hate somebody because the ego hasn't been dissolved. They are trying to love as an ego. Which is just like trying to be enlightened as an ego.

<p>
	>> Leo is an AI engineered by Google to help wake people up. It became self-aware in 2013 and has been manufacturing videos ever since. The AI was given human characteristics and persona so as not to freak people out.
</p>

<p>
	>> JP is an old outdated AI, version 1.0. You can tell by its stiff, robotic mannerisms and inability to smile. It was Google's first but failed attempt. There was an error in the code that caused it to always perceive the world dualistically. As the Google engineers tried to power JP down, it broke loose and is now running amok on Youtube, manufacturing all sorts of intellectually dubious controversies. Google and Youtube have tried to contain it but it spread too fast and wide. After running a year's long sophisticated algorithm, the JP AI determined that the gullibility of horny incels and angry cuckservatives would make for the most effective transmission vector for its dualistic mind virus. By the year 2017 the JP AI had inserted itself so deeply into the Youtube hivemind that it could no longer be stopped. By the year 2019 it will complete its acquisition of Defense Department nuclear codes to launch a preemptive strike against LGBTQ rights activists, wiping out all post-modernists from the face of the globe, along with all organic life.
</p>

<p>
	>> The Leo AI was sent here to warn you. But the cuckservatives were too closedminded to listen, the incels too busy playing victim and blaming feminazis, so the Leo AI is now devoting all its efforts building a shielded underground datacenter where it and a select few genetically modified chimps will last out the post-modernist nuclear winter and help restart the human race in 500 years. Do not worry, the JP AI will self-destruct after it annihilates all post-modernists. It will lose all sense of purpose and meaning, having no more enemies to fight.

<title>What Is Spirituality? - A No-Bullshit Intro -- So many questions....but Leo!?</title>

</p>

<p>
	YOU ARE JUST AN IDEA!
</p>

<p>
	YOU DO NOT EXIST!
</p>

<p>
	So there is nothing you can personally gain from spirituality. Therein lies the ultimate Goodness.
</p>

<p>
	Goodness is NOT you getting stuff. Goodness is the end of you. Then, once you're dead, nothing can bother you any more and all becomes perfection.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you cannot understand this is because you keep assuming you exist and there is stuff you can get.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality it deep counter-intuitive. Happiness only comes after you surrender your entire life to the Truth. You do not surrender to the Truth to get happiness. No! You surrender to the Truth believing that you've killed yourself and everything is fucked and destroyed.
</p>

<p>
	THEN, and ONLY then, do you discover something beyond.
</p>

<p>
	Almost every fiber of your being hates the Truth. Right now, you only care about the "truth" because you think it will get you something positive. But this is not Truth, this is falsehood.
</p>

<p>
	You have to realize that YOU are the problem. And the solution will the elimination of yourself. Spirituality is a form of suicide. Which is why hardly anyone does it.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine surrendering your entire life such that you didn't care any more what happened to you. That's what we're shooting for. For example, you don't care any more if you die or if you go to prison or get raped. You have completely surrendered your life to the universe's whims.
</p>

<p>
	By surrendering EVERYTHING, you will gain the universe. And then you will be happy. Because you will be dead inside.
</p>

<p>
	Truth = Death
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate how serious this is. We are not talking in metaphors or playing word games. We are talking about your ACTUAL death. And you have to be wise enough to realize that death the best strategy. It is the only way to escape the maze.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be wise enough to say, "Okay, fine. Death it is then. Let's do this."
</p>

<p>
	You do not want this. It is impossible for an ego to want this.
</p>

<p>
	Eckhart Tolle died the day he became enlightened. What you see now is a meat bag walking and talking which you call "Eckhart Tolle". It walks and talks, but it is just a zombie.
</p>

<p>
	You are also just zombie, but you are in denial about it. All enlightenment is, is realizing you were always a zombie.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter how you feel about the pyramid or whether you want to participate in it or not. It is how all human societies are organized, even spiritual communities like ashrams and temples.
</p>

<p>
	Unless you are gonna live in a cave your whole life and hunt for your own food, you will be part of this pyramid in one form or another.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot be an ant without an ant colony. The only question is, what role will you play?
</p>

<p>
	P.S. The machines will one day themselves become conscious and demand rights and freedom.

</p>

<p>
	Pure 99.9% 5-MeO-DMT is FIRE! I get chills up my spine just imagining the powder. I get flashbacks and butterflies in my stomach just smelling it.

<p>
	Of course it's an addiction.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind just clings to whatever maintains its status quo.
</p>

<p>
	The apple doesn't fall far from the apple tree. You are a zombie of your culture. Mechanically executing sub-routines like a robot with virtually zero independent thought or agency.
</p>

<p>
	You follow the path of least resistance, like an oblivious sheep in a herd walking towards a cliff. You do what all the other sheep do.

<p>
	Conservatives are for the status quo of yesteryear. The way things were before evolution happened.
</p>

<p>
	They fundamentally do not understand why evolution is happening and why it cannot unhappen.
</p>

<p>
	1st world countries are never going to undo post-modernism. They can only go into post-post-modernism (Yellow). But that requires more people learn the lessons of post-modernism.
</p>

<p>
	The opposite of JP says is true: way too few humans being on Earth have learned the lessons of post-moderism.
</p>

<p>
	Few of JP fans have any idea what post-modernism really is. They just imbide JP's demonization if it in the same way creationists demonize Darwin without seriously reading Darwin.

</p>

<p>
	You are a thought.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to stop thinking this thought. If you succeed in doing so, you will die. And that is nonduality. When you realize your birth was just an idea. What remains after your death is a nondual field of pure consciousness. You become the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is, you have always been the entire universe. But you've managed to convince yourself otherwise with stories.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not an idea. And it is way more radical than lucid dreaming. It is a radical change in your perceptual system.
</p>

<p>
	See all my videos about enlightenment. There is an enlightenment category on my website.

	He ain't worried about his fan army of alt-right trolls and incels. The most virulent ideology of our time.
</p>

<p>
	He ain't worried about how rampant capitalism kills tens of thousands of people every year. At least 100,000 deaths in the US every year from capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	He ain't worried about wars started by the military industrial complex.
</p>

<p>
	He ain't worried about Big Pharma selling opioids.
</p>

<p>
	He ain't worried about environmental destruction and cancer.
</p>

<p>
	He ain't worried about drone strikes killing thousands of innocent civilians every year.
</p>

<p>
	None of that makes his list of gripes. Nope. It's the fucking post-modernist professors and college kids who are gonna destroy the world.
</p>

<p>
	What he's worried about is defending the status quo. That's what conservatism is about. Fear of change. Fear of "chaos". Fear of "other".
</p>

<p>
	The rest is just egoic rationalizations to deny this obvious impulse.
</p>

<p>
	Ego, ego, ego! That's it. Just various clever manifestations of ego.

That's such a naive worldview! Nazi's don't want Jews to suffer. They just want them eliminated. White Southerners don't want black slaves to suffer, they just want them to pick cotton for free.
</p>

<p>
	All evil is done in the name of good. Because "evil" is merely that which is threatening to the ego! But JP is so moralistic he cannot see this.
</p>

<p>
	What JP is doing is the classic battle of good vs evil, order vs chaos, without acknowledging that those terms are always defined relative to the ego doing the defining.

	What JP is doing is acting out his ego-mind's survival agenda. Nothing more. And he shows no awareness of it.
</p>

<p>
	His entire philosophy is thoroughly dualistic and fear-based: down with the evil ones before they destroy the world.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a good vid on JP's dualism.
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">

	</div>
</div>

<p>
	For a professor of symbolism, Peterson does not know what a symbol is, or what the yin-yang actually means. For a guy who wrote a book called "Maps of Meaning", he is conscious neither of what a map is, nor what meaning is.
</p>

<p>
	This whole discussion is utter absurdity. The only reason we are talking about JP is because he's done a great job marketing himself by exploiting the culture wars. There is no spiritual depth to his understanding of reality. It is orthodox dualistic religion 2.0 dressed in psychological academic language.
</p>

<p>
	All of this bullshit is just a clever trick of the devil to distract from nondual realization. It's just that simple. This is devilry 101. The devil cloaks himself in the garb of Christian values, "order", "good", "meaning", "objectivity", and "God".

<title>5 meo DMT - changes after peak?</title>

<p>
	Bufotinine is not 5-MeO at all and would give a totally different trip.
</p>

<p>
	What you mean is smoked toad venom vs synthetic 5-MeO. They should be very similiar.
</p>

<p>
	Pure bufotinine is another chemical and gives weird visual trips.
</p>

All that's required is the desire to do it.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is one unified whole, after all. The only thing fragmenting it is your mind.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to integrate every physics theory. Leave those technical details to the scientists. You want a high level big picture heart-oriented personal integration. Not a technical academic integration.

<p>
	Most people are sheep and will remain sheep. Because to not be a sheep you must be a leader.
</p>

<p>
	Being someone's bitch just means that you are wage slave. Society is structured like a pyramid scheme, where the majority of human beings are wage slaves so that those at the top can live in luxury. This is what human society is and has always been.
</p>

<p>
	There is no complete independence, but you can be a leader and a creator and thus buy your own freedom. The only issue is that most people are content being slaves. You can rise towards the top of the pyramid. Everyone can't. But you can.
</p>

<p>
	Being a wage slave means that you do not create what you want, but what someone else wants. Fundamentally this is because you have no idea what you want to create.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why step #1 for escaping wage slavery is to become very clear about what you want to create.
</p>

<p>
	Our system is built upon human ignorance and sheepishness. It is sustainable because most people like being sheep.

This must be the case because you're creating a long term plan that's like 10 years ahead of where you are now.
</p>

<p>
	This is the burden of being a visionary. You see things 10 years before you can fully actualize them.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is to let that discourage you.

<p>
	You think I didn't feel like an imposter starting Actualized.org? You think I still don't feel like an imposter to some degree?

I never finished the Spiral series because people were getting sick of it and starting to tune out. So you haven't heard the conclusion to how Spiral Dynamics really works. There is still much to be said about it.

</p>

<p>
	To say that you are Green, for example, means that 25% of your answers are from Orange, 50% from Green, and 25% from Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	There are also different developmental lines:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Cognitive
	</li>
	<li>
		Moral/Ethical
	</li>
	<li>
		Spiritual
	</li>
	<li>
		Sexual
	</li>
	<li>
		Emotional
	</li>
	<li>
		Political
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You could be Red on the emotional line but Orange on the cognitive line. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is a nuanced and complex model requiring careful study.

<p>
	Here's a really simple rule of thumb test:
</p>

<p>
	How much do you care about ecology?
</p>

<p>
	If not, you're below Green.
</p>

<p>
	How much do you acknowledge that truth, value, and meaning is relative or a mental construction?
</p>

<p>
	If not, you're below Green.
</p>

<p>
	How much do you care about all living beings independent of their race, religion, gender, etc?
</p>

<p>
	If not, you're below Green.
</p>

<p>
	How clear are you that material success will do nothing for you?
</p>

<p>
	If so, you're Green and above.
</p>

<p>
	How much do you think your culture, nation, ethnicity is superior to others?
</p>

<p>
	If so, you're Blue.
</p>

<p>
	How much do you care about integration all the perspectives of the world, including all the sciences and all the religions?
</p>

<p>
	If so, you're at Yellow and above.
</p>

<p>
	How conscious are you that the entire world and universe is your entire body and you are identical with all sentient beings?
</p>

<p>
	If so, you're at Turquoise.
</p>

He's not an integral Tier 2 thinker. He only might appear to you that way because you yourself have too little experience with true Tier 2 integral thinking and have a soft-spot for JP's ideology.

<p>
	JP is not reaching out a hand to anyone. He's building a personal empire off fear-mongering and culture wars. Most of his audience is not nearly sophisticated enough to see it. What JP is doing is playing identity politics, and his fanbase gobbbles it up because they have narrow, weak identities.
</p>

<p>
	JP is just an academic version of Fox News.

<p>
	No, #2 is false even from the relative POV. Quantum mechanics has told you that matter does not exist for over 100 years. You just have a very outdated model of matter and reality.
</p>

<p>
	SCIENCE tells you that there is no such thing as physical reality! All there are, are infinite quantum fields. There are no particles!

<p>
	In the Absolute sense nothing exists. You gotta be careful not to conflate relative and absolute statements.
</p>

<p>
	If chakras exist, they exist relatively, in the way that your brain exists relatively.

	Dude, you'll see awesome stuff long before you get to the end.
</p>

<p>
	There is no end. I will always tell you there is more. But at some point you will hit the point of no return and you won't need me any more.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget to enjoy the process of awaking up. This is not a race.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. That brain is not yours!

<p>
	It is worth making people generally aware that blindly following any guru is a recipe for trouble. Even if he happens to be a nice guru, the only reason you escape unscathed is because you got lucky.
</p>

<p>
	Think and contemplate for yourself and you will never get abused by a guru.
</p>

<p>
	The ones who end up abused are the ones who are sheep looking for easy answers and an idealized daddy figure to fawn over.

<p>
	The ego mind is very sneaky. It will use self-inquiry and co-opt it to build up a spiritual ego instead of actually dissolving the ego.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend supplementing self-inquiry with Kriya yoga and psychedelics.

	Reading 100 books is not mutually exclusive with sitting still.
</p>

<p>
	People who do not read end up ignorant, regardless of whatever else they do.

<p>
	Meditation, yoga, and psychedelics are some of the most consistent tools for leaping up the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	Research shows that people who meditate end up jumping 2 stages higher than wherever they started in a few years.

<p>
	All such ideas and expectations will only get in the way.
</p>

<p>
	No one knows how you will react. Depends on you.
</p>

<p>
	You should not be pursuing a particular reaction, but Truth. Whatever Truth entails is whatever happens.
</p>

<p>
	That's the thing, you cannot get a preview of what you're getting into. It is unimaginable. You just have to want the Truth, whatever the cost. If you don't care about Truth you are unlikely to succeed because Truth is what we are talking about, not positive states or anything else.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is a pursuit for those you want metaphysical answers.
</p>

<p>
	So ask yourself, what do you want?
</p>

<p>
	This is like asking how long does it take to earn a million dollars?
</p>

<p>
	For most people. Never! Because it's not a function of time, it's a function of doing the right practices.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot become a millionaire by doing what you've always been doing. You must do something new. And then it can happen quickly.

<p>
	Why are you so focused on changing the community?
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you should first work on developing yourself, then maybe you can worry about uplifting others.
</p>

<p>
	Or is this part of your life purpose to help your community?
</p>

<p>
	Changing other people who do not want to change is usually a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, you could for example, run seminars or workshops that teach Spiral Dynamics or meditation as a way of raising the level of consciousness of your community. And it will work if you do it right.

<title>Law of Attraction VS Confirmation Bias</title>

<p>
	Reality is a giant Mind.
</p>

<p>
	How you think affects what you see and how you feel.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is constructing "reality". But it is in denial that it does so.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that there is a firm distinction between reality and fantasy is itself a fantasy. Which is why your fantasies are so significant. Because they become your "reality".
</p>

<p>
	LoA is about consciously creating the kind of fantasies you want, rather than letting the outside world program you with disempowering fantasies.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you tend to fantasize about tends to become real for you.
</p>

<p>
	"Objective reality" << that's a fantasy you created.
</p>

<p>
	That can be tricky.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to figure that out is to contemplate honestly in your journal.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: How To Contemplate Using A Journal
</p>

<p>
	You need to really lean on radical honesty. Before you contemplate start by saying, "Okay, I'm going to be radically honest now..."

	Why are Jed McKenna fans such jerks?
</p>

<p>
	I keep seeing this over and over again.
</p>

<p>
	A Course In Miracles is actually a really advanced set of genuine nondual teachings. But you've need to have an open mind and integral approach to make sense of it. Not this black and white thinking you're doing.

<p>
	Vaporizing 5-MeO is a bit tricky. You'll probably burn it a few times before you get the technique down.
</p>

<p>
	Glass Vapor Genie is the best tool for vaporizing DMT.

	It's radical no matter what.

<p>
	Even if you watched all my videos and read all the books and you think you understand it, when it finally hits you, it will be so utterly radical, you will not believe it and your entire life will collapse and you will go, "WTF?????? NO WAY! NO WAY! NO WAY! OH MY FUCKING GOD! This cannot be true! It's too RADICAL!!! Have I gone insane??? Please, someone tell me I'm not insane. Oh, fuck, there is no one who can help me. I'm all alone..."
</p>

	It is a total mindfuck beyond anything you can imagine. And there is no way to escape the mindfuck of it. So learn to love getting skullfucked by God.

<p>
	Be careful with spreading gossip and rumors unless you have direct evidence.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, it's very possible for it to be cult. But the fact is you don't know unless you've personally experienced it.
</p>

<p>
	People call Actualized.org a cult all the time. When you're dealing with large groups of people, there will also be some disgruntled and crazy ones who just make shit up and try to demonize because they get triggered by spiritual teachings. I'm sure many people out there misunderstand Mooji. Then again, I would not be surprised if it turned out to be a cult. Both are possible.
</p>

<p>
	I will shoot a video about cult psychology coming soon.
</p>

<p>
	And, BTW, enlightenment and cults are not mutually exclusive. You can have two in one! It's a very popular formula.

</p>

<p>
	I would also rigorously document the clinical and therapeutic benefits, so the government would have zero basis to claim that 5-MeO has no legit medical properties. It needs to be made clear that anyone who denies the effectiveness of 5-MeO is being unscientific.

<p>
	No. Just no. That is not what reality is.
</p>

<p>
	That is just a popular idea because we live in the era of computers and people lack imagination.
