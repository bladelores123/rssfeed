</blockquote>

<p>
	No, interpretations vary. Interpretations are not the Absolute itself. But also they are.
</p>

<p>
	The paradoxes here are unavoidable because the Absolute cannot be captured in any finite symbolic order, since the Absolute is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	When you are directly conscious of the Absolute, you become it. You are not interpreting it, thinking about it, or even looking at it. You and it become ONE. Then you can come back down into duality and do interpretations and analysis on it. But when you're doing that, you're again disconnected from it. Yet at the same time you cannot ever be disconnected from it because it is all things at all times.

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	Truth = Absolute
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is singular and the same for everyone.
</p>

<p>
	And here's the mindfuck: there is nothing but Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as falsehood or untruth. Just different degrees of confusion about the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is so total that is includes within it all "falsehoods" because it is them.
</p>

<p>
	If anything I said in this thread confuses you or leaves you skeptical, you need to study nondual literature (see my book list for ideas). You're lacking a basic conceptual understanding of nonduality.

<p>
	God/Absolute is a tautology. There is no alternative to the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	How your mind interprets the Absolute can vary, but the Absolute itself, Truth itself, Oneness, is the same for everyone. Hence it's called Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute means it doesn't change under any circumstances.

<p>
	After that you ARE Love. You are already dead and there is nothing left to do but play. You are no longer in control. God is doing God. The material world continues to appear but it is like you were never born. Human life is over at this point, even though human things still happen and a human body continues to survive in the human world. But all of it is not human to you any more. You are in the eternal mind of God. Forever here in every moment. Infinity. The one and only Creator. Alone by yourself forever. Perfection, heaven, paradise. The one thing which cannot ever be spoken to anyone.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I recognize that bhakti is one path out of many for some people. I recognize the relativity of all paths to awakening. The question is, do you?
</p>

<p>
	Personally it's a path I don't resonate with. Or, you could say I am doing bhakti yoga, but my deity is reality itself, not any one classic avatar. My devotion is to Truth and Consciousness in their pure, abstract, formless form.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to pray to elephant-man, knock yourself out.
</p>

<p>
	My only question for you at the end of all that will be: are you conscious that your elephant-man is imaginary and that you are God? If not, your path hasn't taken you all the way.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is this: if you spend years praying to elephant-man, when I tell you that your elephant-man is imaginary, you are very likely to get upset and angry and defensive because if it was imaginary, why did you spend all those years praying to it? And that's exactly my point.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than dicking around with elephant-man, why not cut straight to the chase: You are God imagining all of reality. There is no higher truth than this. Devote yourself to realizing that. And that will be the highest bhakti.
</p>

<title>My very first psychedelic trip: 1.5g Shrooms.....wow...thank you so much</title>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10453-moon777light/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="10453" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10453-moon777light/" rel="">@moon777light</a> Good. That was a nice newbie intro. Your mind is still very chaotic and random, which is why you had all those wacky visions.
</p>

<p>
	As you do more, you must learn to focus your mind and contemplate the nature of reality rather than just going on joyride visions.
</p>

<p>
	Visions are fun, scary, and interesting, but what really matters is getting down to understanding what consciousness is, and what YOU are.
</p>

<p>
	So far you got a tiny taste of what consciousness can do: it is infinite imagination -- which is why you're able to have all those wacky visions. But you don't yet comprehend what consciousness in itself is and why it is here, or all of its many facets. You also probably don't understand how conscious in the trip connects with consciousness in "material reality". You have to build an intellectual bridge between your trips and "real life" until you realize that your "real life" is just another trip.
</p>

<p>
	Keep your future doses low. You have much more to learn at these lower doses. Mushrooms can be extremely challenging at the 4g range and above. At 4g+ your old life and reality will start to completely disappear and you will enter the phantasms of your mind. Since your mind is chaotic and impure and lacks nondual understanding, you will encounter all sorts of horrors of your own imagination and you will start to go insane. 2 grams is a good solid dose to do lots of work with without totally freaking yourself out.
</p>

<p>
	Try contemplating questions next time like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is consciousness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is time?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is "other"?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is self? What am I?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is awakening?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is love?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is evil?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is the brain?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is death?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is nonduality?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is awakening?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Oneness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is intelligence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Will?
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The next time you trip, realize that whatever your mind imagines gets materialized. If you start to think of elephants you will see elephants on the carpet. Wonder why does this happen? It happens because you are God imagining the world and the psychedelic removes the shackles on Infinite Mind.
</p>

<p>
	Finally, turn your gaze directly inwards and ask, "What am I?!"
</p>

<p>
	Be prepared for epic strange loops, paradox, and mindfuckery.
</p>

<title>Closing in Game</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44638-closing-in-game/?do=findComment&amp;comment=562521</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Closing is a very specific skill set.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to just date randomly and see what happens, go ahead. But you'll lose lots of girls. If you're okay with that, fine. But most guys would get very frustrated and want to construct an optimized skill set to deal with the repeated challenges.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4457-elisabeth/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="4457" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4457-elisabeth/" rel="">@Elisabeth</a> I understand your disgust, but you also have to see the relativity of the situation. Dating for men and for women is very different. This advice doesn't make sense from a woman's perspective but it does from the man's. You have to appreciate how much rejection the man has to deal with. It's not like the man can only approach one girl and make it happen. He has to approach hundreds. That process by its very nature is mechanical and objectifying, not just of the woman but also for the man. Imagine approaching 100 people and getting rejected 95 times. What do you do? Imagine that out of 100 approaches you get 5 people to like you and agree to come home with you because it's the world's perfect match. A match made in heaven. But then 4 in 5 times the person's friends will come and drag them away and you will never speak to them again. What do you do when facing such odds?
</p>

<p>
	See, from the woman's POV none of this is noticed as a problem because you play the selector role and you don't have to do 100s of approaches. From your POV, one right approach is all it takes because you are on the receiving end of the approach. So from your selfish POV you think a guy should invest tons of energy into one approach. But from the guy's POV it's exactly the opposite. He can't invest any energy into any one approach because most of them fail.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the relativity in self-agenda here. If you say, "But what about true love?" Yeah, that's your female self-agenda. "True love" is defined differently for a female vs a male given their reproductive asymmetries.
</p>

<p>
	Neither side is right. It's relative. It's survival. It's selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	My advice was for men, not for women. Of course women are not going to like it because if dating advice is any good it, by definition, encroaches on the other gender's self-agenda. The man's agenda is to invest less energy into the woman, the woman's agenda is to have the man invest all his energy into her alone. At least initially until a serious relationship is formed. Then things can equalize somewhat.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I feel terrible when I eat heavy carbs. That's like the worst possible meal for me, even if it is all organic, whole, and vegan. A big load of carbs hitting my gut kills my consciousness for about 2 hours.
</p>

<p>
	If eat some smoked salmon or a burger on lettuce, my consciousness and energy is smooth and consistent.
</p>

<p>
	It's so noticeable I stay away from carbs like that.
</p>

<p>
	Green veggies and fruits don't create this problem for me, but they also have so little calories that I have to be eating them every 2 hours to stay energized and not hungry -- which is highly inconvenient and impractical.

The mind wants to make shit up in order to feel certain and secure, even if the thing is totally false.
</p>

<p>
	People who predict exact dates for when the world will end get even more convinced the world will end after their dates pass and nothing happens. The ego-mind loves to double-down on its ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	If the world didn't end in 2012, surely it will end in 2013. Surely in 2014. Okay, now it definitely has to end in 2015. Okay, no later than 2016 for sure this time.

<title>Spirituality for the chronically ill</title>

</p>

<p>
	Still, of course, that doesn't mean anything goes. Some stuff you simply may not be able to heal under your limited human powers. But you'd also be amazed at how much stuff can be healed. So it's worth a try.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you can't heal a thing, you might still be able to reduce the symptoms and suffering. You can find coping strategies too.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a serious health disorder, doing lots of research and experimentation is crucial.

<title>Do you need the help of a master/guru to face ultimate death?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44733-do-you-need-the-help-of-a-masterguru-to-face-ultimate-death/?do=findComment&amp;comment=562508</link>

<p>
	This is just basic logic:
</p>

<p>
	If awakening always required a guru or teacher, nobody would be awake, since there would never be that first person to wake up (for lack of a teacher).
</p>

<p>
	Clearly at least 1 person woke up without a guru/teacher. And if one can do it, more than one can do it.
</p>

<p>
	And of course, in practice, many people have woken up independently without teachers all over the world at different times in history.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, you may benefit greatly from good a guru/teacher. Awakening independently requires hardcore motivation and commitment which very few people have.
</p>

<title>Questions about self help and spirituality.</title>

Focus first on the ordinary stuff before you start grappling with the tricky spiritual metaphysical stuff.
</p>

<p>
	As far as your real-world experience goes, you believe you are a human who has emotions and thoughts, and you believe that humans are responsible for their actions. This is what's true for you. Yes or no?
</p>

<p>
	So be honest about where you're at.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what some guru says, what matters is what's true in your experience. Some guru could tell you that you are God, but that is not your experience so don't approach life using the guru's story. Approach life as it is for you.
</p>

<p>
	If some day you realize you are not a human, then things will change for you. But that's not something you should worry about now.
</p>

<p>
	Also, spirituality tells you that you are EVERYTHING, so of course you ARE your thoughts and emotions too. You're just not only those things. Spirituality requires taking responsibility for how you create your whole reality. So there's no contradiction. But start with the easy stuff like the sentence completions.
</p>

<p>
	A collapse of what system?
</p>

<p>
	Democracy? Capitalism? Earth?
</p>

<p>
	I don't see these collapsing. There will be downturns for sure, but overall I think we aren't doing too bad. 100 more years of development will correct many of the current imbalances.
</p>

<p>
	The tide on environmental responsibility is turning. Capitalism has already clearly hit its limit and more people are open to the next stage of economics which will be a capitalist/socialist hybrid. Democracy is a bit under threat by nationalism right now, but that will not stick. Democracy should only get more democratic in the long term.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest wrench in the werks would be a nuclear detonation I think. The rest we can manage.

<p>
	The question is more complicated than simply "What is optimal?" There is also the question of what is practical.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps it is optimal for health to grow your own fields of celery and spend 2 hours juicing it every morning. But that's not practical for most people.
</p>

<p>
	There are trade-offs between optimal, practical, affordable, and pleasurable/enjoyable. And all of those are factors people care about.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are certainly not like a horse who is being fed meat or a lion who is being fed bananas. We are much more flexible. Flexibility is one of our stop strengths.

<p>
	History will be very unkind to Trump. Future generations will read about Trump in disbelief, wondering how 40% of the country could be so stupid as to buy anything he says. Those who supported Trump will be seen as neanderthals -- the way we think about Southern slaverowners today.
</p>

<p>
	Pretty soon after Trump's gone no one who supported him will admit they ever did. They will deny the whole thing because it will be too embarrassing to ever mention you supported him. Similar to how people today deny supporting the Iraq war. Similar to how no one today will admit that they or even their parents supported segregation. It's just too ugly to admit. Only those "others" could support something like segregation or slavery.

Of course there are some risks with psychdelics, especially when you are using them on mentally unstable people, but medication are more risky and in general there are risks with almost anything in life.

<p>
	Of course. Within the next 30 years psychedelics will be legalized for medical use for PTSD, depression, anxiety, OCD, ADHD, cancer, end of life care, marriage counseling, psychotherapy, other mental illnesses, and more.
</p>

<p>
	Clinical trials are already underway for MDMA, LSD, mushrooms, and more. All they need is some time and more funding.

<p>
	I have not researched that disorder.
</p>

<p>
	In general I'm suspicious of "genetic" as a justification for anything. Sure, a few very serious things might be genetic, but for the most part you should assume you got good genetics and look for other problems -- ways your genetics are being improperly expressed or used. Many problems that people tell themselves are "genetic" really are not, and are changeable with research and effort. You won't know until you try.

<p>
	Actually death has sorta the opposite effect. It removes all sense of urgency because after death you realize you are Eternal. You cannot really die and there is nowhere else to go. You as God will be here forever.
</p>

<p>
	But it has also motivated me to work harder towards fully embodying God, since nothing else matters. The sooner I can become God-like the more people I can share my love with and at deeper levels. So the the Leo organism is more motivated to better align itself with God rather than wasting time in devilish pursuits.

<p>
	There is no reason why in the future we couldn't modify human DNA so much that a male could carry a baby. There is nothing in the DNA which says that "females must carry babies". The DNA knows no such limits or distinctions.

<p>
	Yes, except you will be Nothing then. So you will not be able to impose any of your selfish agenda on creation. Your Will will become identical to all of Creation itself in alignment with maximum Love.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense God doesn't a choice but to Will maximization of Love, because God is identical to Love. Will = Love at this highest level. So it's not like as God you can act like an asshole and create selfish bullshit to amuse yourself. If you arr fully God, you are so selfless and loving and intelligent¬†that you cannot make reality anything less than what it is.
</p>

<p>
	God is a tautology. Love is a tautology. Because Oneness means there is no other way it could be. God cannot not be God because it has nowhere to escape to, except into self-deception.

<p>
	Whether you find that credible or not is irrelevant from my POV.

<p>
	Now, you might ask, "But Leo, if you died, how come you're still here." To which the answer is, I was never here to begin with, you merely assumed I was alive. Leo was never alive. Leo was an illusion. And that remains the case at all times.

<p>
	Well, you need to wake up to the fact that there cannot be anything other than Infinite Consciousness and that "the brain" is imagined by Consciousness.

<p>
	All of these crazy things I say require direct expeirence to validate. Which means you got work to do. It's not a matter of believing me. It's a matter of doing the work.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	No! Because Leo is God in finite (limited) form.¬†So here I am, in limited form, unable to make a table disappear.

<p>
	Yes, relative.
</p>

<p>
	We sin because we are not sufficiently selfless. We are not sufficiently selfless because we have finite material forms which we must defend and survive. We must survive so that we can live long enough to feel seperate from God. We feel seperate from God so that we may reunite with God and realize we are God.
</p>

<p>
	That is the universal cycle of God-realization.

I mean what, do you srsly believe you will be able to make a table dissapear one day for example just because of your sheer will? I think you've been watching way too much nithyananda and sai baba.. hint hint.. both have been exposed as NOT being able to levitate AND not able to "materialize" objects into existence.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's exactly right, a table can be materialized out of thin air. Which is exactly how a table can exist at all and how God creates it.
</p>

<p>
	But this does not mean that the finite Leo organism has the ability to do this. It doesn't precisely because it is finite, because it is human.
</p>

<p>
	If you want infinite willpower you must become so selfless that you will cease having a physical body.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't a cop-out or an excuse, this is absolutely necessary and fundamental, otherwise Creation would be run by a devil and would not be maximum Love. A finite self cannot have infinite Will -- that requires total selflessness.

<p>
	Depends on what you mean by "creationism".
</p>

<p>
	If you mean it in the silly Christian sense where the Earth is 5000 years old and humans lived alongside dinosaurs, and evolution never happened, then that's false.
</p>

<p>
	But if you mean it in the sense that an Infinite Intelligence designed the whole universe in its own Mind, that is true.

</p>

<p>
	The important part is that he is compromised, not the 2016 election itself. His ties to Russia are largely financial and no one has seriously investigated his finances yet. Muller didn't look into that.

<p>
	That's precisely the problem. Your vision is so limited that you do not even comprehend the simple fact that without pain in your body you'd be dead by the age of 3.
</p>

<p>
	All of the suffering of your body is there to make sure you survive long enough to do spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way, if you were designing a child from scratch, would you give your child the ability to feel pain? If you say "Obviously no!", you're a fool because that means your child will only be able to survive a year or two at most.
</p>

<p>
	You must contemplate the genius of God's design. Nothing is there willy-nilly. Nothing is there to torture you for the sake of torturing you. If you think something is not necessary, think again. If it exists, it is necessary in the bigger picture. Just keep in mind that the picture is really, really, really big. God's design must account for all creatures, not just your personal pleasure.
</p>

<title>Do you need a goal in fitness?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44717-do-you-need-a-goal-in-fitness/?do=findComment&amp;comment=561989</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Don't take bodybuilders too seriously. They tend to be an overly vain bunch with their materialistic goals.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, you will hit a point where you just want to maintain your health. You can't be hitting bodybuilding goals forever.
</p>

<p>
	At some point your goal should be to just have an enjoyable healthy workout.
</p>

<p>
	There's really nowhere to go once you drop all those vain bodybuilding goals.
</p>

<p>
	Goals can be great at the beginning though, if you need to lose some weight or just getting into the hobby. Of course you can have goals to build up certain muscle groups or whatever. But you can't keep raising your goals forever. Nor is that even desirable.
</p>

<p>
	After 10-15 years of non-stop gym work, I gave up on the whole notion of fitness goals. It's a waste of energy which you should be channeling into your spiritual work. Moderate exercise is all that anyone needs once they are at a healthy weight and eating properly.
</p>

<p>
	You might even want to replace gym with hatha yoga at some point.
</p>

	Russian interference is obvious. The only question is to what extent, and collusion is still a iffy, but certainly within the realm of possibility. If Trump had the chance he'd certainly do it. His only defense might be that he was too incompetent to coordinate something like that.

<p>
	I think it's good stuff if you can afford it. It might really help with certain issues. Not all issues, but some.
</p>

<p>
	You can find great local reiki healers simply via Yelp. And there are other kinds of healers besides reiki on there which might be even more useful, again, depends on the issue.
</p>

<p>
	It's definitely genuine. Whether it's worth the cost depends on what your goals are and your salary.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a decent salary it's a good investment.

<p>
	You're thinking about this is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Your fibromyalgia is likely the result of you living your life in unspiritual ways.
</p>

<p>
	The fibromyalgia isn't holding you back from spirituality, it is PUSHING you to wake up!
</p>

<p>
	Your body is screaming at you: WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WAKE UP! WE CAN'T KEEP LIVING LIKE THIS! CONNECT ME TO SOURCE!!!!
</p>

<p>
	This is a much more robust issue than merely meditation. Your entire life needs to be spiritualized and infused with mindfulness and consciousness and love.

</p>

<p>
	You don't take for granted that healing is an option. Healing happens on many levels: physical, mental, spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend you find a local psychic healer / reiki healer who can help you work on your fibromyalgia and give you guidance.
</p>

<p>
	Fibromyalgia especially is a spiritually-related illness. If you had a broken spine, that might be another matter.

<p>
	Yes, you can do that. Battling the ego can sometimes be a useful formuation, but often not. Often the better approach might be to love the ego to death, so to speak.

<p>
	Christianity is very dualistic in misleading ways.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the notion of being "a sinner" creates a battle between ego and God.
</p>

<p>
	"A sinner" is just a devil, ego, or self. But the sinner is an illusion. There is no sinner and no sin. Most Christians do not understand this. Christians gets trapped in the duality of good vs evil, which itself becomes the source of the illusion of evil. The mind creates evil by imagining it.
</p>

	It feels like Infinite Love. Imagine if you loved every object in the universe as much as you love your mother, your children, or your dog. But more! Literally Infinite Love! It is completely unlimited. You Love so much that it grows bigger and bigger and bigger until you realize that it literally has no end whatsoever. By this point your entire self gets annihilated in this love and you literally die as a human self. You die and become God -- which is pure Infinite Love.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Death = Infinite Love
</p>

<p>
	Did you really think God would let you die into some hell? Don't confuse God for a devil. God has ensured that all beings die into Infinite Love. How did God guarantee this? By making Love and Death identical!

</p>

<p>
	Which is why all these egos (seem to) exist. God allows them because no one is forcing you not be a devil. God doesn't fight devils with force.

</p>

<p>
	God's Love is so great that God isn't bothered by Hitler. Your love is so small that you hate Hitler. That's because you're a devil. If you realized you were God, you'd love Hitler as much as you love your mother. But this is far to radical for mankind to admit. That's because mankind are devils. But luckily God is perfectly okay with that!

<p>
	No, it all depends.
</p>

<p>
	Although in practice many awakened folks tend to run their own shops. Once you're that conscious it just doesn't makes sense to waste your consciousness working for some fool to earn him money.
</p>

<p>
	The point of awakening is that then you're in a great and rare position to help uplift the world. The world needs your conscious leadership. You don't awaken and then go work at Wall Street to make a killing, hehehe...

<p>
	Of course we do, because you are an ego. So your definition is deliberately backwards, to protect yourself. That how you survive.
</p>

<p>
	If you had an accurate definition of ego, you'd be dead. The ego's job is to ensure you don't understand what ego actually is.

<p>
	You could say it doesn't exist. It merely appears to.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes. Since there is only ONE thing, and it is LOVE, everything must be it, including any appearances or illusions, and everything is done for the sake of maximizing Love.
</p>

<p>
	Which closes the loop of the final duality: Why is there selfishness? To maximize selflessness!
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness and selflessness are identical! Ta-da! Which means: the devil is God! Which means: evil is Good! Which means: there is no evil, only Love!
</p>

<p>
	So in this way God defeats the devil. Not by fighting with the devil, but by leaving no room for a devil to exist. There never was a devil (ego). The devil/evil was always an illusion. There was only ever LOVE.
</p>

<p>
	And all illusions are there to maximize Love, they are the expressions of Love. Without illusion and survival, there could not be Creation. So of course all of your suffering is out of Love.
</p>

Doesn't God create everything selflessly? Isn't ego the veil that allows God to love itself?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	God/Oneness/Consciousness/Nothingness/Infinity is Love
</p>

<p>
	God is creation itself. God is selflessness itself. God is Love.
</p>

<p>
	No, ego is the prism which polarizes God's Infinite Absolute Love into limited, finite, material love.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Love is like pure white light. Once that Love materializes into some formed thing, or through some finite creature, that Love is made finite and selfish. It is exactly like shining pure white light through a prism which polarizes it into many lesser discrete colors. The love shining through all humans is like the color blue or red or yellow. But God's Absolute Love is white, containing all the above, being the Source.
</p>

<p>
	So when God's Love shines through a dirty prism like Hitler or Trump -- that's what love looks like in its finite form.
</p>

<p>
	When God's Love shines through a pure lens, it looks like that of Jesus or Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is the lens/prism. When you realize that ego isn't real, its like removing all prisms from the path of the light, allowing it to shine white.
</p>

<p>
	The clearest telescope is one which has no lens at all. The clearest lens is Nothingness! When your lens is Nothingness, you are Truth, you are Love, you are God. You stop looking at things, you BECOME the things you used to look at.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, God's Creation is completely selfless. Since all selves are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, an asleep God wakes up to realize that he is God.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing other than God can awaken because there is nothing other than God! God is ONE, so who can awaken other than him to himself?

<p>
	The ego doesn't exist. The ego cannot awaken. The ego cannot learn anything. It is the realization that ego never was -- that it is a total illusion -- which allows God to realize that it was God the whole time.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is the mistaken idea that reality is divided into parts: me, you, her, him, them, animals, Jesus, aliens, God, etc. To realize ONENESS is to end all these divisions and exist as ONE. That ONE is the real God.
</p>

<p>
	If the ego could awaken, that would mean there are two things: ego & something else which it awakens to. That would be duality. But Truth is ONENESS. So there cannot be an ego.
</p>

<p>
	We speak of ego as though it's a thing, but really where's speaking of a non-thing. It's like speaking about a snake which is actually just a rope that we thought was a snake. There never were two things: a snake and a rope. Nor did the snake become the rope. There never was a snake at all! Only rope! The snake was just a confusion. Which leaves us with oneness, ropeness.

<p>
	Watching that video, Bobby fundamentally misunderstands the notion of ONENESS and relativity.
</p>

<p>
	If God is ONE, if God is Infinite, you must be it. The distinction between self/other is relative. So there cannot be a difference between you and God, you and Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	To otherize God or Jesus is a monumental misunderstanding of spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	It is not the ego which wishes to become God. It's is GOD which wishes to awaken to GOD! To label the desire for God-realization as ego is basically the worst form of devilry (ignorance/selfishness) which forever keeps one separated from God.
</p>

<p>
	It has nothing to do with building a bigger Youtube channel, LOL.
</p>

<p>
	YOU ARE GOD! Wake up! Stop denying. It is actually the ego which pretends it is not God under a veil of false humility so that it can maintain a subtle sense of "other" and therefore maintain a sense of self. The ego makes God something other than itself so the ego could survival as a new spiritual ego, a Christian ego which is now a follower of Jesus. This is one of the ego's greatest self-deceptions and Bobby has fallen into it.
</p>

<p>
	ONENESS is the ultimate truth. Any sense of distinction or duality must collapse. Never forget this fundamental law.
</p>

<p>
	Bobby is God pretending to be a Christian who is not God. Bobby is God imagining Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	Bobby may have taken some psychedelics, but he did not properly contemplate and realize what they had to show him. Instead he fell back into selfishness. The humble Christian self is the ego in sheep's clothing.
</p>

<p>
	Like I keep saying, there are many, many degrees of comprehension and realization of what God is. Bobby is just scratching the surface of this whole thing. There is mindfuck after mindfuck yet for him to realize. Most important for him would be the realization that self and other are indistinguishable. "Leo" is just a figment of his (God's) imagination.
</p>

<p>
	It is not merely that the Holy Spirit flows through you -- NO! -- YOU ARE FUCKING GOD! The one and only! You are just trapped inside your own mind so deeply that you can't even imagine a way out.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you are visited by Jesus if you pray to him is because you are God imagining him! Your will creates this dream we call reality.
</p>

<p>
	Bobby's video is actually very useful because it illustrates how deep the self-deception can go. Even someone like him, who has studied Buddhism, psychedelics, Eastern mysticism, and even watched my videos -- can still fail to reach the deepest level of Truth by getting stuck at some lesser level. Which is why I constantly warn you guys about being so careful about your epistemology and the many degrees of realization. Spirituality is way more complex and tricky than you can imagine. Just when you think you've finally figured it out, you're self-deceived.
</p>

<p>
	I wish Bobby a quick recovery from his paradigm lock. So he can take back his full authority as the sole Creator of this Universe.
</p>

<p>
	This video is also a great example and reminder of how dangerous Christianity can be. It's an elaborate device of the devil to keep you from finding God. The devil achieves this precisely by co-opting the very thing you trust the most. Anything you blindly trust, the devil will use against you to hide God from you. You have to appreciate that the devil is pure, ingenious self-deception. The devil has turned self-deception into an artform the two crowning achievements of which are science and religion.

<p>
	Of course if there is a values mismatch that should kill it long-term. Sex can't resolve that problem.
</p>

<p>
	But if that's the case, cut it off rather than this kissing for 2 years until she gets a new boyfriend. That's just silly.
</p>

<p>
	With relationships, by dragging it out the suffering is made much worse.

	If you shit in a public pool, the shit will eventually come back to you because you'll be swimming around in it for a long time. That doesn't mean it will come back within 5 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Right now your logic is: "Well... the pool is quite large, so if I shit in the northwest corner but I swim in the southeast corner, chances of it coming back to me are low so maybe I can get away with it."

<p>
	Working with emotions is very tricky stuff because they are not logical and they completely control one's behavior and thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	Bulling your way through emotional issues with a cold heart and lots of discipline will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional issues require a compassionate, gentle, loving, mindful approach.
</p>

<p>
	It's about becoming heart-centered rather than stuck in your head. It's about feeling into things, feeling into your body.
</p>

<p>
	The whole macho attitude of dominating emotional problems has to go.

<p>
	He is great to listen to, but just keep in mind that he doesn't understand spirituality,¬† nonduality, awakening, love, etc.
</p>

<p>
	He makes some excellent points about politics and ideology that are worth integrating.
</p>

<p>
	He's not really a communist in the way most people use that term. He likes to be provocative. By "communist" all he really means is a larger role for the state, and moving towards world government.
</p>

<p>
	You can agree or disagree with him on that, but his points about how ideology works are quite profound and important to understand. He makes important structural points there.

	Look, even psychoanalysis can be useful. It all depends on how you use it and what level you want to reach.
</p>

<p>
	I am speaking from the point of reaching absolute understanding of Self and reality. It won't take you there.
</p>

<p>
	Shadow work is useful but it ain't awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Have to be clear about your goals to select the right methods. Sometimes you need shadow work. Sometimes you need nonduality.

<p>
	You can find God through Jesus, but it will be a very limited path and you will probably not understand that Jesus is imaginary and that¬†you are God imagining him.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of understanding what God is. The deepest levels are nondual and formless, so any kind of imagery like Jesus will get in the way. It's also crucial to understand that all spiritual imagery is relative. You could worship an elephant-man and it would work the same as Jesus. Because it's all imaginary. To get stuck on one set of imagery is so limiting.

<p>
	Not a belief, a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you were in a different state of consciousness you could become a kangaroo. But you aren't there. Changing states of consciousness is a real challenge because it defines "physical reality". It has to appear rock solid for reality to feel solid and not dreamlike.

</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you are looking. But there is no you.
</p>

<p>
	For awakening, that sense of you-ness must collapse. The mind will do every slippery thing possible to maintain the sense of you-ness. It's basically impossible to imagine what life would feel like without a you.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at the room, but while imagining you were never born. Notice the room is there without you.
</p>

<p>
	The sense of you is stuck to the room¬†like toilet paper on a shoe, and it refuses to come off, since obviously that would be the end for you.
</p>

<title>Closing in Game</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44638-closing-in-game/?do=findComment&amp;comment=561576</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Closing involves a lot of factors and is an art in itself. This is perhaps the most advanced aspect of game on which hinge most of your results.
</p>

<p>
	Basically closing requires being really experienced¬†at these things:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Screening her to make sure she's possible to isolate
	</li>
	<li>
		Being really good at planning logistics on the fly. Being really good at improvising new plans
	</li>
	<li>
		Leading -- getting her used to following you around
	</li>
	<li>
		Bouncing between various locations
	</li>
	<li>
		A convenient place to isolate her to (could be her place, or even a rented motel room, or even behind the elevator)
	</li>
	<li>
		Dealing with last minute resistance, shit-tests, and endless excuses
	</li>
	<li>
		Dealing with her annoying friends who will try to cockblock you every chance¬†they get
	</li>
	<li>
		Seduction -- physically and emotionally turning her on.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	How do you learn all the above?¬†Lots of trial and error, watching other experienced guys do it, and by studying some basic theory.
</p>

<p>
	Expect a lot of failure and near misses.
</p>

<p>
	One of the dirty secrets of PUA is that even the best guys only close like 50% of the women they manage to bring home. In the end, you can't force her. And many times she will be too relucant. But even to reach this point already takes serious skill. Just learning how to isolate her is tricky. There will be so many excuses and logistical obstacles. Endless excuses.
</p>

<p>
	Even once you get her panties off, it's still not a lock. You can lose her at any point. You can even lose her while you're inside her! It's a circus.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing will increase you lay count more than having a convenient place very near to where you met her. This is HUGE! It's so important it's worth paying an extra $1000/mo for it. Living within walking distance of the club/bar is priceless in game. If you have to drive 40 mins to your Mom's house, forget about it.
</p>

<p>
	That should be plainly obvious when you watch how conservatives defend Trump and war.
</p>

<p>
	They operate from an entirely different¬†(and lower) level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who advocates for war gives himself away right away. That tells you who they are. A highly conscious being would never advocate for war.
</p>

<p>
	To be fair, plenty of centrist neoliberals also advocate for war. They are¬†slightly more evolved, but not by much.
</p>

<p>
	Also the nationalism is a dead givaway of low consciousness. Nationalism is what gives rise to the racism, xenophobia, homophobia, mysogeny,¬†culture wars, and fascistic/authoritarian leanings.
</p>

<p>
	Why do all the Republican Senators support Trump's brazen illegality and devilry? Because in their heart they like the notion of a strongman / authoritarian, as long as he is THEIR authoritarian. So they follow like sheep.
</p>

<p>
	Liberals are less inclined to behave this way. Liberals are less conformist, more free-thinking (even though they still of course get trapped in group-think).
</p>

<p>
	Studies show that liberals have higher openmindedness. Which is a key dimension¬†of consciousness. You can't be conscious and closedminded at the same time.
</p>

<title>Psychedelics Paradox</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44596-psychedelics-paradox/?do=findComment&amp;comment=561367</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Psychedelics are a catalyst for facing one's shadow and transcending one's ego. The more dysfunctional one's ego is, the more shadow one has, the less stable one's mind is, the more things can go wrong during a trip.
</p>

<p>
	People with mental illness or¬†disorders need psychedelics more than anyone, but they are also less likely to handle facing their shadow.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a high stakes bet for such people. If you win, you win big. If you lose, it will be hell.
</p>

<p>
	Proper and very gradual dosing is crucial in such cases. You don't want to bite off more than you can chew. The less mentally stable and whole that you are, the less you can chew, the less you should bite.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you are mentally unstable the less likely you are to follow my advice, the more sloppy your approach will be, the more likely you are to overdose and freak out. Ignorance cannot help being ignorant.
</p>

If you are not addicted to sex, how do you know when to have sex?
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the solution to these issues. The more conscious you become the more wholesome your actions become overall, the more you act in alignment with wisdom and intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Balance is a function of wisdom and consciousness.

</p>

<p>
	If you are a visionary big picture thinker, that is far more valuable than bean-counting. Stop trying to get the bean-counters'¬†approval.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This just doesn't square with the facts.
</p>

<p>
	Humans have successfully adapted to cold environs for 100,000s of years. In fact, cold climates are more ideal for the growth of civilization, which is why the most developed countries are from the north, generally speaking.
</p>

<p>
	Eskimos are well adpated to living in Alaska and Nepalese have specially adapted lungs for living in the high altitudes. They can climb Mt Everest without oxygen tanks when most white people need to use oxygen tanks.
</p>

<p>
	And of course our skin colors have fully adapted to the climate we hail from.
</p>

<p>
	Evolution adapts fast. It's always adapting, even today.
</p>

<p>
	Humans and technology go hand in hand. These two cannot be treated seperately. Technology is a huge part of our evolution. We have adapted to cooked meat, fire, clothing, etc. long ago.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, we lived through the ice age and ate all the mammoths (probably). If you hail from Europe, eating mammoths is in your DNA.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are more diverse than a single other species because we adapted to live all over the world.
</p>

<p>
	Humans who survived in Alaska didn't do it on fruit.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's exactly the solution.
</p>

<p>
	Go be around people of various races and cultures until you stop seeing them as other or weird.
</p>

<p>
	Racism is very simple: it happens because people get stuck in a small circle of those who look like them and think like them. If everyone traveled around the world and interacted with people of all races and cultures, racism would disappear in a few generations.
</p>

<p>
	People deliberately segment themselves into like-minded enclaves in order to avoid expanding their sense of self and realizing their oneness with all beings.
</p>

<p>
	This is why people in major cities are less racist than those who live in the countryside. Because in a big city you are forced to interact with those who are different than you, but in the countryside you're living among your own kind, living in a racial/ethnic bubble.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, stopping wanting to cling to your own kind enough though that is what's more comfortable for your ego-mind.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	My point is not about politics. It's about the attachments you're exhibiting. You are missing the point of what I said to you, because you're stuck on matters of content.
</p>

<p>
	I let people know about pundits' fallacies in a non-attached way, conscious of the relativity of my perspective. That is the crucial difference. You are on here pushing an agenda every week. It's a question of attachment vs detachment for your own perspective.

Let it go. The way you comment is not in the spirit of our work here. Free your mind of that shit.
</p>

<p>
	All this political stuff you must hold very loosely, otherwise it turns into just another ideology. The content of your ideology is irrelevant, what matters is that your mind is stuck on it.
</p>

<p>
	Our work here is not to find better content to cling to, but to go meta and become conscious of the relativity of all content held. When you become conscious of this, you stop judging and blaming people.

	Reality is 100% direct!
</p>

<p>
	There is no how.
</p>

<p>
	Your looking for a how is the dualistic mistake.
</p>

<p>
	You are engaged in the process of asking what the Earth stands upon? Elephants. And what do the elephants stand upon? A turtle. And so on...
</p>

<p>
	This entire pursuit of elephants and turtles is misguided. There is just the Earth! No elephants or turtles. No how. 100% direct. Nothing is hidden. You need to realize that and stop chasing your tail.

<p>
	Yes, there is always the risk.

<p>
	But then again, life is a risky business.

	In practice you have better odds of catching an STD.

<title>Zizek quote</title>

<p>
	Lol, that is his fundamental mistake.
</p>

<p>
	He's running away from himself with his philosophical work. And it's obvious just by looking at his neurotic ticks when he speaks.
</p>

<p>
	This is the problem with academic philosophy. All brains, no consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is that there is no difference between inside and outside. But if Zizek would turn within, he'd discover God. Which is a problem for him, since he's an avowed atheist/materialist. So he keeps looking outside, forever lost in his own mind.
