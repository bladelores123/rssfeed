<p>
	Sorry to say but it seems he's just not that into you and maybe looking for an upgrade.
</p>

<p>
	This early into a relationship he should be really into you. He probably just doesn't want to hurt your feelings by telling you you're not the one for him.
</p>

<p>
	Game can be directed towards various goals. The goal does not define game. You could do game to find a wife. In fact, many guys are interested in that.
</p>

<p>
	Game is simply learning how to attract women. How you use this skill is up to you. You could use it to become a rapist, or you could use it to start a family.
</p>

<p>
	Practically, to find a good life-long partner requires burning through lots of dates to find the right one. Your first handful of relationships are going to be awful.

<p>
	It may be.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that such health conditions usually have dozens of possible causes, not one. So you need to troubleshoot them all until you find yours. Do not assume there is one universal cause or solution.

<p>
	I'll believe it when I see it.

<p>
	Just because you become more conscious does not mean what you're attracted to changes. The idea that conscious girls are above game is silly. A girl is a girl and they are all fundamentally attracted to the same basic things. As are guys.

<p>
	No, she was very interested. Just the usual games and BS. It was not even close to rape.
</p>

<p>
	Girls often make BS excuses before sex. It's all part of the game. She can't appear like a slut.

<p>
	I will provide a simple intro and outro clip that will be the same for all clips.
</p>

<p>
	So basically just clipping my old videos is the job. And titling them.
</p>

<p>
	The trickiest part of this job is simply selecting which portions of a 2hr video are worth clipping. If you can do that, the rest is really easy.
</p>

<p>
	Writing juicy titles also takes some skill, but it can learned.

Do you think that dairy is a big cause of acne in people? I have a lot more acne than other people my age and I ingest a lot of dairy. I also heard in your video on buying healthy food that you had a lot acne too when you ate/drank dairy. So, is dairy a big cause of acne?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	For me dairy does not cause acne, but certain food additives do. I only get acne if I eat out at fast food and other such restaurants. I never get acne if I cook my own food.
</p>

<p>
	But you may be different. If you do a strict elimination diet and cook all your own food you can quickly discover what is the cause of your acne. Acne occurs about 3-6hrs after eating something your body reacts too.

<p>
	Yes, all dairy products. Dairy sensitivities are very common, not to mention the hormones and chemicals that can be present in it.

</p>

<p>
	Also, diet is not the only factor. It might be heavy metal toxicity, or the water you drink, or the shampoo you use, or the plastics you consume. So you have to eliminate all those factors as well.
</p>

<p>
	And even then, you might have developed leaky gut, or SIBO, or something else which requires further action to heal.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, eliminating gluten and dairy and junk food should probably be your first move. But that's just the beginning.
</p>

<title>Hiring Part-Time Video Editor</title>

<p>
	I'm creating a second Actualized Clips channel which will feature short segments of my long videos. Similar to Joe Rogan's Clips channel.
</p>

<p>
	I'm looking for someone with video editing experience <u>and</u> good sense who can chop up my long videos into elegant 2-8 minutes clips. You gotta understand which juicy parts to clip and which parts not. You also need to be good at coming up with sexy titles for the clips. Not click-bait, but titles that are appealing and generate clicks.
</p>

<p>
	This would be a long-term, part-time job, maybe 7-10 hours per week. We can discuss what is fair payment, I'm not sure yet. You would work remotely and manage your own time. I would manage you very little, mostly just giving you feedback on the quality of your clipping and titling.
</p>

<p>
	My videos are very large at 30-70GB/video. You need to have a good enough internet connection to download many of them per month, and you will also need to upload GB-sized clip files. You will upload finished clips to my server. Also, you must have access to a Windows PC which can handle and render large video files. A dinky laptop is not gonna cut it.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind this is not a full-time job so don't expect this to pay all your bills. Think of this as a gig you do on the side for some extra cash. If you are good at this work it would potentially be a very long-term job. I basically have 100s of old videos that need clipping, plus each new weekly video as long as I keep releasing content.
</p>

<p>
	PM me if you're interested in the work. Include a brief explanation of your relevant experience and why you think you'd be good at this job. Also tell me your age and the city you live in.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks!
</p>

<p>
	Her game is playing coy and pretending sex is special.
</p>

<p>
	A girl's game is very sneaky. It's the game of pretending she isn't playing a game. She's so good at it that she perceives it as reality itself.

I mean no matter how busy you are dealing with survival, you can have 30 minutes each day to meditate for example and read some books. Yes you will not become enlightened but doing these things for years will make you more developed than most people out there. The PUA community actually supports meditation and reading books.

<p>
	Of course you can meditate a bit every day. But in practice you will not break through from such pathetically weak practices.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about breaking through via meditation, you need to schedule some 10 day retreats at least, and meditate all day long like a motherfucker.
</p>

<p>
	The PUA community don't know shit about awakening or how to achieve it. Nor do they care. If you follow them you will never awaken. On the other hand, they can get you laid <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	There is definitely a trade-off between sex and awakening. Choose your priorities wisely.

			God can't partially be God and partially be some other thing. "God has to actually BECOME those things" fully and entirely for what it is– its form, its limitation– in order to <strong>TRULY</strong> understand what it's like to be that one thing. God has to surrender its identity entirely (i.e. selfless) to understand what it's like to be something.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Exactly. To be everything one must be nothing. Only nothing is flexible enough to become everything. Like a blank sheet of paper can take any drawings, but a drawn sheet of paper cannot take other drawings. There is an absolute trade-off between drawing one scene vs another scene. You cannot draw a scene of Egypt while also drawing a scene of Japan. Drawing any finite thing precludes the possibility of drawing another finite thing. All form is finite in this way. The only way to escape this limitation is to surrender existence as a form of any kind. Which, God, in its infinite wisdom has done. God surrendered all form to -- paradoxically -- create all possible forms. The only way for God to create everything was to itself be nothing. Which is why God is so hard to find. God is hard to find because it cannot exist as a form -- and since humans are forms, they only care about and look for forms. So humans look around, they don't see God's form, and they conclude that God must not exist. But what they don't realize is that God doesn't have form by design. It's not a bug, it's a feature!

<p>
	In practice, yes. The order of operations is: become skillful at survival, then transcend survival.
</p>

<p>
	For a few exceptionally gifted people this order of operations is not needed, but for most people it is. It is hard to be serious about spiritual work when you are horny and lonely and craving it.

	You assume there is a distimction between real and imaginary things. But there is not. Reality IS imagination. And this is not some bummer. This is the mosg wonderful thing. One day you will realize that you want to live in an imaginary world. It's so much more fun!
</p>

<p>
	Why the fuck do you want things to not be imaginary? Seriously!

	Causality exists within a relative, imaginary 2D plane of what materialists call reality. Similar to how causality exists in a video game world.

<p>
	You cannot apply the logic of people who don't have autoimmunity to those who do. It's a totally different ballgame. It's like giving someone who's allergic to peanuts more and more nuts.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying carnivore diet is good long-term. It's a specific tool for dealing with autoimmune conditions. Think of it as the ultimate elimination or elemental diet.

<p>
	Yes, well, if you could understand what I meant you would become enlightened right this second. Ego must prevent you from understanding it. Your life hinges on you not understanding.

<p>
	I mean that colors and sounds and feelings are happening, but they are not happening to anyone, they are not happening to a human "you". As odd as this sounds, the colors and sounds and feelings that are happening right now are NOT happening to you. They are happening without you. But they are happening. I am not denying colors and sounds and feelings. I am just denying that "you" they seem to happen to.

	This is explained in great detail in my video: What Is Perception?

Why are humans selective in their love? Why don't they love EVERYTHING equally? Because humans have a self they which to survive. This self is finite, therefore it cannot embrace/Love infinitely. A finite self must have a bias to love some things over other things, because some thing might kill it or harm it.
</p>

<p>
	But God has no self! Since God has no self, it has nothing to defend and nothing to lose. Therefore it can Love absolutely EVERYTHING, because why not? Why not love EVERYTHING? Only if you have a self that is biased. But God is Infinitely Conscious, therefore it cannot sustain the illusion of a finite self, and therefore it simply is LOVE as a pure Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: why would reality as whole not love itself completely? I mean... reality as a whole cannot be harmed by anything because it is everything already, and it cannot be any better than it is because "being better" is a notion only the ego cares about.
</p>

<p>
	Notice this: if you didn't care about getting a survival advantage in life you would not care about one thing more than any other. And if you didn't care about one thing more than any other, you would care about all things equally. But if you care about all things equally, see the beauty of everything, which grow infinite. And so you would fall absolutely in love with EVERYTHING because you don't need it to be different than it is.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that keeps you from falling in love with absolutely EVERYTHING is the ego wanting things to be different.

	You could probably grow them in a tiny storage unit for $30/mo if it's legal in your area I don't see the problem.

</p>

<p>
	Just be careful that you are not caught and tried as a dealer. Usually if they catch you making drugs, they will try you as a dealer even if it was just for your personal use. They will just assume you will be selling them and that will stick in court. You do not want to get caught as a dealer or drug lab.

	Move out and find yourself a solitary place where you can feel right.

<p>
	You shouldn't have to abide fools and devils cavorting in your living space.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's annoying to move, but you'll be glad you did. Consider it part of your personal development process. An important part of personal development is setting up your own personal sanctuary at home where no assholes can interrupt you. Don't treat this as unimportant. Your home is important.

	It's more strange-loopy than that.
</p>

<p>
	The brain is not a reducing valve of consciousness, consciousness imagined a reducing valve and called it "a brain".
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is that the brain reduces consciousness not by some material mechanism, but simply you imagining you have one. When you buy the idea that "I have a brain and it produces my consciousness" -- that idea itself reduces your consciousness and THAT is true function of "the brain". The concept of "the brain" is there to ground you in finite consciousness, for without that concept everything would be seen to be as it truly is: infinite <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you were locked in a prison with an open lock, and the only thing keeping you locked in there was your idea that the door was locked! For decades you planned how to break through the lock, and none of your methods worked, until one day you realized there was no lock, and suddenly the door opened.
</p>

<p>
	You ARE the lock and you ARE the key!

<p>
	I never said anything about a rock having a POV. "Having a POV" IS the self! The problem here is not the rock's POV (which you imagine) but that you believe that YOU have a POV! That is the ego illusion. You don't really have a POV, there is Absolute Being, not a POV. Ego imagines the notion of POVs because it needs to feel like it has one. The entire notion of having a POV is wrong.

<p>
	That's a even deeper mindfuck to be had here: Notice that for a chameleon to truly be infinite, it would not only need to be colorless but also formless, thus allowing it to become any other thing. Imagine a chameleon who is such a good chameleon that he had to surrender even his chameleon identity because he needed to in order to mimic a rock, or a bird, or a human. But in this case, if the chameleon really became so strong and good at his function, he would no longer be merely "mimicking" those objects, he would literally BE those objects.
</p>

<p>
	So a true Chameleon cannot even be a chameleon. He must be a non-chameleon Chameleon <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	And if you understand that, then you understand why God must have no identity: precisely so he would take every identity fully, without mimickery. See? God can't just pretend to be rock or a bird or a human, God has to actually BECOME those things, otherwise how would they come into existence?

		<p>
			Question though—does Love address the “why” component of God’s fragmentation? Aka why does God fragment itself into finite perspectives. Like, God delights in realizing itself as infinity by first limiting itself. Or is it more just the fact that limitation is intrinsic to infinity, so it could be no other way?
		</p>

		<p>
			Hopefully that makes sense
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The why is more radical than you think.
</p>

<p>
	God IS Love. Love is Truth. Love is Absolute. Therefore literally nothing but LOVE can ever exist. So if a thing exists, it's ultimate cause is always simply LOVE. Reality is LOVE, and LOVE is EVERYTHING, and God is EVERYTHING. Therefore all the finite stuff is just literally what God is. The end.

<p>
	If Sherlock Holmes ate some mushrooms or hit himself in the head with a hammer, he would experience some odd subjective experiences. And he would consider it a demonstration of causality.
</p>

<p>
	But is it really? All of that "causality" is occurring within an imaginary dimension. The true cause of Sherlock Holmes' odd subjective experiences is not the mushroom or the hammer or his brain, it's the author who imagined him and his entire universe -- of which Sherlock is totally clueless because the author exists outside the plane of his reality.

	Peter Ralston in particular has made some incredible contributions to mankind's understanding of itself, but virtually nobody recognizes it. He really deserves to be as well-known as Einstein. But, alas, that will never be the case.
</p>

<p>
	Being well-known is largely a marketing game. It has little to do with the depth of one's work.

<p>
	You should chase living an authentic life aligned with your top values, your top passions, helping spread truth, consciousness, love, and beauty across the Universe via which ever way most excites you and suits your unique strengths and talents.
</p>

<p>
	You are right that you should not just sit around twiddling your thumbs. You should be constantly working on your life purpose and evolving yourself towards that end.
</p>

<p>
	Life is short. Don't squander it sitting around in confusion and inaction.
</p>

<p>
	False success is chasing what others tell you is good.
</p>

<p>
	True success is devoting your life to expressing the Love that you have for the world in your unique way, and doing so skillfully and eagerly.
</p>

<p>
	False success will not make you happy, but true success will.

<p>
	Think of it like this: a TV screen has no persona until it displays some persona played by an actor in a movie. It would be silly to suggest that the TV has the person it is displaying, or some other persona, because the TV can display infinite personas. The only way the TV can display infinite personas is precisely because its "true persona" is null.
</p>

<p>
	That's how God is. God cannot have a self because God imagines all possible selves and non-selves alike.
</p>

<p>
	A chameleon who can change all of his colors has no color. He is -- paradoxically -- colorless. A colorless chameleon is an infinite chameleon. Colorless = Infinite Colors. No-self = Infinite Self.

			Leo , how to get a girlfriend if I am constantly friendzoned with every girl I meet ?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The only reason you get friendzoned is that you are not communicating with these women from the start with sexual intent. You must change the attitude and style of your conversations to being man-woman -- sexually charged.
</p>

<p>
	That does not mean you have to say anything sexual. But just by the way you look at her she should feel that if she ever gets alone in a room with you, you will rip off her panties and nail her ass to the wall. Nothing needs to be said. It's your attitude. Look at her like you are a hungry wolf and she is a rabbit. She will feel that and you will never get friend-zoned again. You may get rejected however. But rejection is good, it means she feels your intent and it's just not the right match.
</p>

<p>
	You need to project your masculine intent more. Don't hold it back. If you get turned on by a woman, let her feel it rather than hiding it from her. Your being turned on will turn her on. This is a huge part of learning game. You stop apologizing and hiding your sexual attraction.

It is something that I have been debating for a long time, I just can't understand, how important reality is in the end. If I finally make the realization (i already know this, but i have not felt it) that I am god, I am conciousness, then it sort of eliminates the need for sex and relationships, doesn't it? Other part of me wants to just spread joy, love and enjoy this dream together with someone else, who also understand atleast spirituality in-general.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, God does not elminate the need for sex or relationships. You will be as horny as you always were after awakening. And you will still probably want to relate with people in intimate ways.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with seeking intimacy. Go for it. Awakening will not solve this part of your life.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, getting rid of dating insecurity, learning to lead, and getting in touch with your masculine edge is all very important for a man. You can't really live a good life without it. The pursuit of women makes men stronger men. Which is a good thing. In the same way that a lion who cannot hunt is a pathetic animal.

<p>
	It doesn't have to be. But if it wasn't convincing you would no longer call it "reality". It would be a fluid and wacky as your nightly dreams.
</p>

<p>
	The anchors are needed IF you want things to feel "real" and solid.
</p>

<p>
	Just notice how you'd feel if you no longer used the notions of an Earth or brains to explain your daily experience. Notice how it would feel to not have any anchors.

	Same as the Earth. What does the Earth do? The Earth is made of consciousness. Consciousness imagines an Earth to anchor your human dream. A human dream needs anchors like Earths and brains.
</p>

<p>
	What does Sherlock Holms' brain do? It runs his life -- within the limited frame of that fictional universe.

	Yes, I felt a bit better for about a week, but it didn't address any of my real issues and in some ways misled me. It took me months to recognize the misdirection.

	The biggest problem with these kind of therapies is not the lost money, that's peanuts, it's the misdirection and false understanding they give you of your problems.

<p>
	Sounds excessive unless you got some serious medical condition that needs tracking. And even then it would be wiser to do specific narrow tests for your condition.
</p>

<p>
	Cortisol needs to be measured using a saliva test home test kit, not blood work.

<p>
	Diet seems to be the most important factor. You probably have autoimmunity due to diet or toxins that you consume or are already lodged in your body. So you need to do serious elimination dieting to discover which foods your body tolerates, and you need to do some serious detoxing of heavy metals, plastics, pesticides, etc. -- and of course eliminate them as much as possible from your diet.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do a serious elimination diet, 100% carnivore can be a good options for 30 days. That allows you eliminate all plant food, which tends to cause autoimmunity. Or fasting. But fasting for long term is very hard and will introduce other problems so it will be hard to tell how you feel.
</p>

	You can easily set up daily auto backups of your drives/files to a usb drive or network drive with a software like GoodSync.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I store my main commonplace book for the book I am writing on a tiny usb drive, which I can plug into any computer or laptop, and all my machines do daily auto backup to a network drive.
</p>

<p>
	GoodSync could also upload your files daily via FTP to a web host or server of your choice or DropBox.

When your numbers are so low you will constantly be frustrated because the reality is that this is a numbers games. If you hit on 5 girls a year, chances are that none of them will pan out no matter how good you are. If you hit on 1000 girls per year, now you'll get some results.
</p>

<p>
	Talk to more girls. Don't expect any one of them to pan out. Don't focus on attracting any one girl -- that's just a recipe for misery. Girls will be extremely fickle and flakey until they sleep with you. So the trick is to hit on lots of girls and don't hold your breath for anyone particular one to sleep with you. Majority of them won't.
</p>

<p>
	It's just like sales. It is foolish to hinge your entire business on one customer. Your business should be structured such that you are so busy no particular customer matters. You shouldn't need any customer's business and you should be willing to lose it without a hint of threat to your business.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is that when you structure your business this way, more people will want to buy from you. And more girls will want to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	That's creating abundance vs being stuck in scarcity. It's counter-intuitive and girls will tell you they don't want that. But practice they love it because it os am honest signal of a high value guy. A high value guy has lots of options and girls can smell it and they LOVE the smell even though they will deny it if explicitly asked about it.

<p>
	This is shadow work 101.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the child's mistake (now that's he's an adult) is to disown the fact that being abusive is not just a thing "others" do, but that he is also capable of it. By realizing that being abusive is also a part of him, he can integrate it and heal. Otherwise he will forever be resentful because he feels that abuse should not have happened to him because he would never do such a thing himself. But the truth is that he would do such a thing himself if he was placed in that situation.
</p>

<p>
	At an even deeper level he can become conscious that all the abuse that exists in the Universe is literally his own self.
</p>

<p>
	With deep enough consciousness you will realize that whoever abused you, was actually your own self! So you abused yourself. And when you realize that, you can forgive yourself, accept yourself, and heal.
</p>

<p>
	Try to fathom this: you literally ARE every rapist in the world who has ever lived. Rape is not something some "other" "bad guys" do. Rape itself is construction of your own Universal Mind. When you realize this, you stop disowning rape, and you accept yourself as a rapist (even if your human body has never raped anyone). It doesn't matter what your human avatar did or didn't do. Once you realize you are the whole Universe, anything that occurs in the Universe is part of you. Since your true identity is Infinity, that means you are a rapist.
</p>

<p>
	If you are God, and God is Everything, then God is rape, and you are rape.

<p>
	The simple fact is that mankind will not take climate issues seriously until they feel the burn of it personally. So we wait for that to happen. Suffering is the greatest teacher.

<p>
	If you want to do a critique of my work, go ahead. But actually do it. Don't do this pathetic "he's a cult leader" stuff. Actually state which of the things I say are false and why. The way you say "cult" shows that you don't even know what a cult is or how cult leaders operate. Maybe actually read some books about it on my book list, or watch my Cult Psychology videos.
</p>

<p>
	If I am so wrong, then the things I say should be very easy for you to deconstruct. If you were serious about truth-seeking you would not be here using ad hominem smears.
</p>

<p>
	This work has nothing to do with me. It does not hinge on me personally nor should anything I say be taken as a belief -- which I have repeatedly told you guys from day 1. If you cannot personally verify something I say, then it is not true.

<p>
	The point is that the world and life and society are not coming to any end. Not even close. A lot of Green folks portray climate change as if that were the case. Which is a frame that is both false and makes people depressed.
</p>

<p>
	Will some animals and humans get hurt in the process due to climate change. Absolutely. And that has always been the case with human evolution. How many buffalo were hurt in the conquest of America? How many natives?

	Sure, but there are millions of species, and new ecosystems will form, and even new species will arise.

<p>
	Again, it's all a matter of perspective.

<p>
	Ecosystems can be rebuilt. Species can even be reverse engineered.

	Remember, 99% of species eventually die out. The whole Earth is evolving and manmade climate change is plan of that evolution. Mankind is not some "unnatural" force.

			I find this difficult to swallow. Do you have something I can look into other than the massive amount of documentaries and articles that are out there? When I consume research on systems thinking, environmental science etc it suggest that the world will not be a livable place in 100 years and that.

<p>
	It's not a matter of me showing you some research paper. It's a matter of you using some big picture thinking.
</p>

<p>
	A 2 degree rise in climate is not the end of anything. The Earth has been much hotter than that before and life goes on.
</p>

<p>
	Environmental people are too close to the problem to see it in the grand scheme of things. They are stuck in a sort of mid-term thinking which leads to depression. You gotta take longer view. In the long view mankind will terraform the Earth to the perfect temperature.
</p>

<p>
	Listening to scientists without doing your own big picture thinking about their data is the trap here. Scientists are not big picture thinkers. They just robotically spew out data without any consideration of mankind's evolution.
</p>

<p>
	This is not to say we should not take action of climate change and polution. We should. And we are. But it's gonna take time, so be patient. You can't turn an oil tanker on a dime.

<p>
	If your worldview leads you to fear and depression, then obviously something is wrong with your worldview -- NOT with the world!
</p>

<p>
	The point of this work is to cut through the BS that is fear and depression. If this work is not making your happier, lighter, and more playful , you need to change your understanding of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Being fearful, frustrated, and sad is not a conscious or truthful state and it is not how we heal the world.

<p>
	Ego sits much deeper than thoughts, beliefs, or feelings. Which is why the ego doesn't go away simply if you stop thinking for a while.

<p>
	There are dozens of possible causes so there cannot be one solution. You must track down your root cause.
</p>

<p>
	For me, diet plays a big role. Some foods make it much worse, others much better.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely get an in-depth check up of your thyroid. It's a big factor.

			Do you think it’s best to just go with the diet I feel best on? For my case it would be keto, but with people saying it’s a disaster long term, I’m lost. Like do I go on a non-keto diet that I feel worse on relative to a keto diet, just to <em>hopefully </em>save my long term health?

<p>
	Just because it feels good doesn't make it healthy long-term.
</p>

<p>
	Do keto for now, fix your issues, then you can expand to healthier diets. You gotta find which plant foods you're sensitive too and avoid those while eating the good stuff you're not sensitive to.

	It doesn't say explicitly, but if you have leaky gut or SIBO, eating carbs will make things much worse -- and that book tells you to eat lots of carb sources.

<p>
	That's right, you shouldn't just trust such books. You must test against your own direct experience.

	None of this matters if you got SIBO or leaky gut. Carbs are worse in that case.

<p>
	You could try meat + low sugar veggies like leafy greens and maybe some low sugar fruits like berries.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a gut bacteria problem, sugary fruits and veggies will certainly make it worse. After you fix the gut bacteria, then you can go for a more veggie/fruit diet. But until then I would avoid them.
</p>

<p>
	If you have SIBO nearly any fruit or veggie will do more harm than good.
</p>

<p>
	Liver Rescue assumes you don't have SIBO or leaky gut. But it sounds like you do.

<p>
	Life coaching is usually not suitable for people under 25 because the ROI isn't there and they aren't mature enough to male use of it. It only makes sense to coach people who have good incomes and are serious about optimizing their results.
</p>

<p>
	You might consider tutoring as a way to make ends meet. You can tutor high school and college kids. The is much more practical.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that people usually only pay for practical things. It's very challenging to market impractical stuff with low ROI.

<p>
	Usually any sugar is considered breaking the fast. Small amounts of fat are more tolerated since you can still stay in ketosis.
</p>

<p>
	You'll want to research specifically about how diabetics handle fasting. Not sure.

<p>
	You should not because:
</p>

<p>
	A) The whole point of a fast is to rest your digestive system as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	B) Vitamins taken on an empty stomach can lead to some nasty nausea.
</p>

<p>
	You can survive just fine a few weeks without vitamins.

	There are many degrees of quality to psychology. It can be done poorly, it can be done exceptionally.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that you cannot have an accurate understanding of psychology without personal experience jailbreaking your own mind, which requires excellent grasp of epistemology, metaphysics, and spirituality.

			As far as I know, there isn't anything reliable to test for permeable gut thou, the current golden standard (zonulin) has poor reliability and low specificity. Alessio Fassano, who is currently considered the leading authority in this research says we don't have anything even remotely close to being accurate so with leaky gut the best we can do is by symptomology.  What test markers did you order?

			I think the hydrogen/methane test is not that widely available outside of US and UK. In my home country, Slovakia doctors laugh when you talk about SIBO, a client of mine in Czechia was told there is no such thing as bacteria in small intestines by the gastroenterologist <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" /> It is super hard to even have doctors entertain this idea anywhere outside of these countries.

<p>
	That's a problem in the US too. My family doctor laughed at me when I asked him if I might have leaky gut. He say leaky gut is a myth that cannot exist.
</p>

<p>
	Idiot doctors are a dime a dozen. Except they usually charge you more than a dime for their terrible advice.
</p>

<p>
	Luckily you don't need their permission. You can order lab tests yourself. I order all my own lab work.

			3) You seem to recommend oils over grains as a calorie source. Is this purely due to the autoimmune problems that whole grains often contribute towards? (In my own research, I have found some evidence that eating any extracted oils (e.g. olive oil, coconut oil, etc) is very bad for various aspects of health. I have experimented with this by cutting out all oils for multiple years, relying instead on whole grains as my main calorie source. Works fine for me now, but I am young.)

<p>
	I have since been doing more research and learning the importance of reducing oils.

<p>
	I used to believe that keto diet was healthy. Now I tend to believe it is not.
</p>

<p>
	Whole grains seem to be healthier calorie source as long as you aren't sensitive or allergic to the grains. I would avoid gluten grains, for example. But something like quinoa seems healthier than oil.

	A multi-party system does not necessarily have to be inefficient. Not sure why you take that to be inevitable.
</p>

<p>

	Brita filters and their ilk are junk. They will not filter out heavy metals properly.
</p>

<p>
	If your filter system doesn't not cost at least $250, it is junk. You cannot filter water properly too cheaply. Nor can your filter water properly with a single filter. A multi-stage system is necessary. 3-6 stages. 3 stages is the bare minimum.

<p>
	See my video: How To Shop For Healthy Food
</p>

<p>
	Your #1 priority should be to eliminate all processes foods and sugar.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you shop at Walmart, that's not so bad if you buy fruits and veggies. Don't buy anything in a box or anything with added sugars, or anything baked or anything with added vegetable oil.
</p>

<p>
	Waffles, pizza, cookies, baked goods, ice cream -- these are all highly processed and toxic foods that you should never eat again.

<p>
	Yes, of course.

<p>
	But there is room for both. There will be shamanic stuff, and there will highly regulated, "official" medical type use of psychedelics. Going after shamanic practitioners is kinda silly in my view. They are just solo dudes. They will never be mainstream. If these PhD's want an "official" therapeutic system, then build it. Martin Ball is irrelevant to that goal.

<p>
	Truth should be pursued for its own sake.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't care about Truth, you really don't deserve awakening. And you will probably never get it. And even if you get some of it, you won't get all of it. And even then, you will bastardize it.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is more important than your happiness or whatever it might do for you.
</p>

	The prequels were not great in execution, but as least they were imaginative and had original ideas.

	China is growing fast now cause they were so underdeveloped for so long. But their growth will hit diminishing return and they will face increasing internal collapse because growth and authoritarianism are incompatible for long.
</p>

<p>
	China will be forced to democratize.
</p>

<p>
	China will face all the same interal problems the US faces. It will take China some decades just to grow up into America's kind of problems.

	His confused. He keeps trying to crack the nut of God, but he cannot because of his attachments and paradigm. He's not willing to decostruct everything. He wants God yet he wants to maintain the civilizational traditions more.
</p>

<p>
	He's not appreciating how deep this goes and how radical God is.

<title>Psymposia pamphlets against Martin Ball</title>

<p>
	If her PhD was in physics, it would not be much better for purposes of discussing mystical practices.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is that Ball is engaging in mystical practices while these PhD's are discussing it in terms of "legal or therapeutic professional framework". This is like criticizing a dog for not adhering to legal frameworks. There is no legal framework for this shit. And there is not even a scientific one.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, I still don't really agree with Ball's approach. It's needlessly pushy in my opinion. That's the only real problem I see here. Never push a newbie to trip harder if he doesn't want to. It's important that the newbie take 100% responsibility to trip, so that he can never blame you for it. It must be his decision to go deeper. If the client does not give a definitive YES, don't give him any more 5-MeO. Pushing enlightenment on people is not good practice. It will backfire at some point.

<p>
	Of course the objective world and narrative world touch. What's he's missing is that reality is imaginary. Which is why they touch. The objective world is a dream. So is Christ. And JP is God.
</p>

<p>
	He's circling around the answer but will never put his finger on it because he's attached to science, objectivity, morality, meaning, realism, and Christianity.

So it will not cook as well as a proper $150 SS pan.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, SS pans can produce very nice sears. You just need to find the right temp. SS pans have a bit of a learning curve. But once you learn it, making dishes is very easy.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect an SS pan to be as non-stick as a Teflon or Ceramic pan. It never will be. But the pan can last you decades, unlike Teflon pans which you gotta change ever few years. So in the end, Teflon pans are actually more expensive.

<p>
	You can't really use the God word with a scientist because it instantly triggers all their defense mechanisms. The last thing a materialist scientist can admit is that there is a God. So if he knows that's what you're trying to convince him of, his mind will go into 100% denial mode. So it's better to refer to it as Consciousness or Infinity or Universe.

<p>
	The US will never be a one party state. Those kinds of tactics are only workable at lower levels of development where authoritarian methods are used.
</p>

<p>
	A one party state can only exist if it crushes all the other parties with force. And continues doing so chronically.

	That's the whole game of academia: lots of highly technical talk, but very little truth or wisdom. Hence it ends up being so dumb. Because getting the big picture right is way more important than getting the technical minutia right.
