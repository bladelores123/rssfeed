<p>
	That's because your personal lack of development clouds your vision. You cannot understand Yellow until you're at Yellow yourself.
</p>

<p>
	As you become more conscious, you will understand that a stage Yellow person would never behave the way Trump does.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is nowhere close to Yellow. Not even a little bit. Trump actively hates Yellow. He's the opposite of Yellow.

<p>
	Here's a really good example of healthy Blue. Standing up for principles, truth, rule of law, integrity, and decency.
</p>

<p>
	Trump has actually fractured the Blue/Orange Republican party. The more evolved and moderate Blues are forced to denounce Trump's Redish qualities.

	That will depend on many factors, including your Spiral Dynamics level and what kind of lifestyle you want.

<p>
	My fave places are: Washington state, Nevada, Austin, Dallas, Oregon, California, Hawaii, Florida.

<p>
	He's a toxic mix of Blue/Orange and probably has some legit mental issues.
</p>

<p>
	It's very easy to believe your own bullshit when you start making millions of dollars every month selling your ideology as he does. At stage Orange, there is nothing beyond success and money, so when ideology becomes profitable, it's a killer combination from which Blue/Orange cannot escape. Money appears like the perfect validation of God's truth, creating a closed feedback loop of bullshit which feels very real to the person inside it.

</p>

<p>
	Washington state has zero state income tax, which is a great bonus.

<title>Spiral Dynamics. The 1968 Movement and Capitalists</title>

<p>
	A) Many true hippies from that era remain hippies to this day, and are really into self-actualization and spirituality. Most modern self-help is thanks to the human potential movement of the 60's. Many of today's enlightened teachers were hippies in the 60's. Like Shinzen Young.
</p>

<p>
	B) There was a strong, deliberate crackdown on stage Green by stages Blue and Orange. Capitalism outlawed psychedelics and shut down the counter-culture movement. Because it was a deep threat to capitalism. If the US government did not crack down on the counter-culture revolution and outlaw psychedelics, our culture would be much more evolved today.
</p>

<p>
	C) May of the people partaking of the counter-culture movement were just dabblers. Going to a few music festivals does not mean you're at stage Green in your heart.
</p>

<p>
	Most people today don't recognize how much of an impact the 60's revolution had on modern culture. Its effects can still be felt to this day.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I lived in Texas for 5 years. Texas is a pretty diverse place. Sure, you got some cowboys, but the big cities like Dallas are not Blue. Very livable.
</p>

<p>
	And Austin is like San Francisco Green, with a yoga studio on every corner.
</p>

<p>
	Move to Austin and enjoy all the hippies you can stomach.
</p>

<p>
	I might move to Austin next year myself. Great town.

<p>
	Pope Francis is another pretty good example of Blue. Although he too has some percentage of Green which gives him compassion and the value of equality.
</p>

<p>
	Blue + Green make for a very nice combo. Green tempers out Blue's harsh moralizing and us-vs-them thinking.

<p>
	Here's a what a very healthy version of Blue might look like. Of course Comey isn't pure Blue. He's got Orange and Green too. But his entire book and way of talking and carrying himself is a list of Blue keywords.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that Blue can be very stable and reliable. A good judge or executor of the law. A good defender of decency and ethical standards.
</p>

<p>
	Solid, like a rock.

<p>
	Lots of blue collar workers: firefighters, good police people, good FBI officers, decent military folks, tax collectors, post office employees, hard working coal miners, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The 9/11 firefighters mights be one of the most positive examples.
</p>

<p>
	John McCain displays some positive aspects of Blue.
</p>

<p>
	James Comey and Robert Mueller display some positive aspects of Blue.
</p>

<p>
	At its best Blue can be very honest, decent, loyal, hard working, reserved, stable, dispassionate, incorruptable.

<p>
	Green's top value is equality, civil rights, and breaking down hierarchies. So slavery seems antithetical to that.
</p>

<p>
	Green is very critical of the wage slavery of capitalism. Although real slavery is much much less conscious than the "slavery" of capitalism. To call capitalism "slavery" does a disservice real slaves.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine someone like Bernie Sanders. He's not going to enslave anyone, even if he's given absolute power. But he will tax the rich to level the playing field. Which is why Blue & Orange hates him.
</p>

<p>
	It's a function of consciousness. If collective consciousness is high enough, it will not happen.
</p>

<p>
	There is too much stage Green in America to allow for that. So unless you kill off all those Green people, it won't happen. Green would riot in the streets. We are already seeing a huge backlash from Green against Trumpism, and Trump hasn't done anything even close to that.
</p>

<p>
	Even the most conservative Republicans do not want slavery back. Because they are too evolved for that. But 200 years ago, it could have happened. That's how much collective consciousness has grown.

<p>
	Hey, ya'll, I need your help!
</p>

<p>
	I want to create a comprehensive list of video examples of prototypical stage Blue thinking.
</p>

<p>
	This is not meant to humiliate or demonize stage Blue. It's meant to be an educational tool for people learning about Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	So towards that end, scour Youtube and find all the videos you can which exhibit stage Blue thinking. Try to find videos which are short and sweet. Conservative talk show hosts offer tons of Blue material, but also try to find other unique examples. The more diversity we can display here, the better. Try to find examples from various cultures: Europe, Middle East, Asia, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, Africa, South America, etc.
</p>

<p>
	We will create a mega-thread like this for every stage in the Spiral, from Red to Turquoise. But for now, let's just focus on Blue. Each week I will start a new mega-thread topic for the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Do not start a political debate in this thread!</strong> It is not our goal here to defend our personal political positions or to judge any stage, but simply to compile examples.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for your help! I'm excited to see what kind of juicy stuff you dig up. Try to be selective with your choices.
</p>

<p>
	This can turn into a really cool list.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue values:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Absolute truth cannot be questioned
	</li>
	<li>
		Only one right way to live

<p>
	I understand the idea. There is nothing to improve from the Absolute perspective. You're already perfect.
</p>

<p>
	But this is not mutually exclusive with personal development. You can and should do both. You don't need to be "flawed" in order to grow, learn, and evolve your lifestyle and modes of behavior.
</p>

<p>
	You can be a perfect human being, and still not know how to play the piano, and then decide to learn to play master piano. Wanting to learn to play master piano is not egotism, unless you make it such.

<p>
	I guess they can be Red at super extremes, but I'm talking about mainstream feminism.
</p>

<p>
	Just like I would not classify PUA as Red but Orange, I would classify feminism as Green. Because feminism seeks the values of Green for the most part. I don't think your average feminist wants women to dominate men. She wants equality.
</p>

<p>
	And your average PUA wants to bang a bunch of hot girls (which is pure Orange).

</p>

<p>
	An example of Red PUA would be a PUA who actually rapes or beats a woman. This isn't simply manipulative behavior, it's thuggish criminal behavior, which is Red. And I have met such PUAs. But most PUAs are not that low. They are mostly Orange. They will manipulate and lie, but within limits.
</p>

<p>
	The reason Julien got into hot water is because he was glorifying borderline Red behavior. And people rightly got outraged. Abusing and humiliating women is counter-productive to PUA, not to mention deeply unconscious, and terrible PR.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are a lot of positives to Blue (especially relative to Red). I focused on negatives in the video because the point of talking about the stages is to help people see the limitations of each stage, so they can be motivated to transcend.
</p>

<p>
	If I had to choose between living in a Red or Blue society, I would choose Blue.
</p>

<p>
	I agree, the Medieval church was not as backwards as many people today believe. The Medieval church was trying to spread enlightenment, in a twisted way.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org is basically just a modern version of the Medieval church.

They are not good or bad. Green is not supposed to be "good" or "evolved" or "better than" or immune to excess.
</p>

<p>
	Feminism is Green, AND there are healthy and unhealthy ways in which Green manifests. An unhealthy manifestation of Green does not knock it down to Orange or Red. It's just excessive Green.
</p>

<p>
	Men who are stuck in Orange have a really hard time understanding feminism. Too much judgment clouds their vision. Feminism is simply the desire of women to break down the traditional alpha-male value dominate hierarchy and gain parity with males. Women want to be heard after centuries of being ignored and shut up. Sometimes they take it too far.
</p>

<p>
	Without feminism, you get stuff like Saudi Arabia not letting women drive cars or open bank accounts. So feminism is very necessary for building a more fair society. And if you were a repressed woman, you'd likely resonate with feminism.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine your daughter not being able to vote or drive a car simply because your tradition forbids it. Not very nice. Imagine your daughter getting raped, but then her testimony in court against the rapist doesn't count, because she is a woman, and a man's testimony carries 5x more weight by law, so the rapist goes free. Would you be cool with that? How would that make you feel if you were the woman who got raped?
</p>

<p>
	Maybe that would make you a feminist?
</p>

<title>The Clare Graves Model is the Most Manipulative Thing I've Ever Heard Of</title>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/11494-sea/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="11494" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/11494-sea/" rel="">@Sea</a> A stage Yellow person is never going to revert back to stage Blue. It's sort of like leaving a cult. Once you are conscious enough, re-joining a cult cannot work on you. For example, there is no way that Albert Einstein or Barrack Obama could become an ISIS Jihadist (unless maybe his brain is damaged). It would never happen because he's too conscious for that.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to see a stage Orange society revert back to stage Red. America is never going to become a theocracy like Saudi Arabia, for example.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Temporary regression is possible in the sense that one may still not be stabilized at one's level. For example, America leaned Green with electing Obama, and then regressed back down to Blue/Orange with electing Trump. But this was not a change in America's level of development, it was just a difference of expression. America is evolving up the Spiral. America is not going to be Blue in 100 years as much as it will be Green. So to say that there is no directionality would be very misleading. There will never be a time when slavery and Jim Crow laws get re-instated. That ship has long sailed for Americans.
</p>

<p>
	When you are angry/fearful, you will express lower stages than when you are joyful and confident. So there's that additional wrinkle. For example, if America experiences a new great depression, or a nuclear attack, then the population will be angry and fearful, so they will skew more conservative, more Blue, more authoritarian.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, Clare Graves' understanding of Spiral Dynamics was itself limited because he was not a nondual mystic. He didn't really understand the connection between Spiral Dynamics and Consciousness. My explanations of Spiral Dynamics are not just a parroting of someone else's theory, but my understanding of it, which is informed by my nondual experiences.
</p>

<p>
	And very importantly, being at higher levels is not "good" or "better". Turquoise is no "better" than Red. At the highest levels of nonduality you will have unconditional acceptance for all stages, all "evils", all ignorance. You, as God, are EVERYTHING, with no better than, worse than, or lesser. A human is not better than an ape or a dinosaur or a pig.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Spiral Dynamics can easily be abused, like any model. As far as models go, Spiral Dynamics is a very complex and nuanced one, with lots of subtlety, which can easily be misapplied unless you study it very closely. There is a tendency to oversimplify Spiral Dynamics. To apply Spiral Dynamics properly you need to be a solid stage Yellow. Lower stages will tend to misapply it.
</p>

<p>
	Is Spiral Dynamics limited? Of course.
</p>

<p>
	Is Spiral Dynamics the Absolute Truth? Of course not.
</p>

<p>
	Is Spiral Dynamics helpful for growing yourself and your society? Very much so, if you apply it carefully.
</p>

<p>
	Can Spiral Dynamics be abused to justify all sorts of judgments and evils? Of course.
</p>

For example, the ancient greeks were very accepting of homosexuality and other practices that were considered very taboo by other civilizations. Even the romans were accepting of this behavior. However, when these empires collapse it seems like life when backwards and all progress just stopped. Have lower stage civilizations taken over higher stages in the past?

<p>
	It's a tricky topic. It's hard to judge from our vantage point who was more advanced, Rome/Greece vs the Christian empire. The Middle Ages were not as dark as is popularly assumed.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, up to 45% of the Roman population were slaves. It's difficult for us to imagine just how barbaric and cruel life was in these ancient civilizations. Sure, homosexuality might have been accepted, but you could also be thrown into a pit of lions for some random reason, or your wife raped on the side of a bridge crossing.
</p>

<p>
	If a Roman city was sacked, all the men were slaughtered and all the women and children sold into slavery.
</p>

<p>
	Christianity did bring about a certain degree of moral order.

</p>

<p>
	At the deepest levels of nonduality all action is pointless. You could just shoot yourself and it would be okay. It's all perfect. Teaching is pointless of course. But in practice you will probably just carry on with life, for shits and giggles, and probably teach.
</p>

<p>
	The world cannot be improved in any way at all. It is an Absolute singularity, and everything is already contained within it for eternity. But this is not something that can be explained, and it certainly sits outside of Spiral Dynamics so I don't even talk about it. You will only discover this for yourself, at the very deepest levels of nondual consciousness. At which point, you will no longer need me or anyone else to guide you.

You cannot get to unconditional acceptance through intellectualization or belief. You need to start having some nondual experiences, mystical experiences. Psychedelics or yoga/meditation is the way.

<title>Is Stage Green A Weird One for Men (Spiral Dynamics)?</title>

<p>
	Yes, this is actually a big obstacle for men, because most men are so preoccupied with appearing alpha.
</p>

<p>
	From all the criticism, judgment, and resistance that I see about Green, it feels like 50% of it is coming from males who have not sufficiently embodied their manhood, so they are insecure, and try to act macho, thereby demonizing Green.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I said about stage Blue: embrace your feminine side. This will also apply to stage Orange males. The power of embracing your feminine side is enormous.
</p>

<p>
	To a juvenile man or "bro", Green will feel soft and weak.
</p>

<p>
	I once recommended a Matt Kahn video to a PUA coaching client of mine who was stuck in stage Orange. It was a really important video about love. He refused to listen to the advice because Matt Kahn came off as "too soft and feminine".
</p>

<p>
	The striving to be alpha and macho is really toxic.
</p>

<p>
	I was basically unable to coach him out of his issues because he was so insistent on acting out Orange to the max. He just couldn't fathom the value of Green. And yet, all of the answers to his problems lay in Green and beyond.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with Orange is that it's extremely shallow. There is no satisfaction to be found there.
</p>

The Greeks were famously open to homosexuality and pedophilia.
</p>

<p>
	I meant it's a new evolutionary wrinkle in modern culture. The last 50 years have seen a huge change in public perception of homosexuality. A really big shift occurred even just since the 90's. Even many Republicans these days are starting to accept homosexuality, which would have been shocking 50 years ago. Our culture is changing rapidly. Which is why stage Blue feels under attack by progressives like Obama and Hillary.

That's a secular battle.
</p>

<p>
	Absolutism doesn't have to be about God and religion, but it usually is.
</p>

<p>
	Stubbornness and closedmindedness is not exclusive to Blue. It tends to manifest all along the Spiral in various forms.
</p>

<p>
	Green people can be fairly ideological about equality and civil rights issues. For example, Green Peace or PETA. That doesn't make them Blue. They are solid Green. Green, like any stage, can get dysfunctional at its extremes.
</p>

<p>
	The key difference between Blue and Green is that Green is against rigid hierarchies and focused on equality, building human bonds, sharing feelings. Blue is focused more on law and order and tradition.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You can technically have mystical experiences at stage Blue. But these days, if you're going to become enlightened, you're probably gonna be at stage Turquoise, especially if you follow sources like Actualized.org or other modern nonduality teachers. Because we all teach inclusiveness and holistic thinking in a non-sectarian way.
</p>

<p>
	In that past, when people became enlightened they would mostly do it within a single insulated tradition, like Christianity or Hinduism, or Zen. Nowadays you can hardly stay insulated from all the various traditions. Nonduality has become a melting pot.
</p>

<p>
	Deep nondual experiences will tend to push your values and worldview towards Turquoise quite naturally.
</p>

You really gotta grow into deep Yellow and Turquoise in order to be able to look upon Blue and the other stages without animosity. At Turquoise there is a deep realization that everything within reality is necessary and perfect. When you realize that, you see that every person is precisely where they must be. It makes no sense any longer to blame or criticize people for their ignorance because they know not what they do and they cannot help themselves.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to attain peace for yourself is to totally drop all judgment of people and reality. And this can only happen by becoming conscious of the truth of nonduality. You have to realize that self/other are literally identical.
</p>

<p>
	If you accomplish that, you will be left with unconditional love for all. You will see the world the way God sees it: perfect as it is.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest obstacles to enlightenment is giving up all your judgments, demonizations, and criticisms of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being unable to judge anyone or anything ever again. Such a notion scares most people. Unconditional love is very radical. The ego cannot stand it. It's too dangerous from the ego's perspective.

<p>
	Science, rationalism, pragmatism, materialism, and secularism is the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	Of course science has dogmas and group-think in it, but significantly less so than traditional religion. Science does strongly emphasize empirical validation and skepticism. Science is more willing to evolve its web of beliefs. A good scientist is supposed to be openminded and curious and non-ideological in a way that runs counter to strict obedience to scriptures and father figures. Science requires some degree of rebelliousness.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Orange is more independent-minded and materialistic. Less concerned with the afterlife. That's science and business.

	It's that simple. But it requires building up a great concentration ability. One-pointed focus. The mind will struggle because awareness is empty, and the mind cannot latch onto it.

He's really good at playing golf, so just to challenge himself sometimes he doesn't tee-off on the fairway, but from inside a sand trap or behind a tree.
</p>

<p>
	It keeps the game more interesting.
</p>

<p>
	And its also necessary because not every human being can be born to good parents in a good country.

<p>
	Of course, because you are resisting integrating it. Which is why JP appeals to you. He's stuck in the same place. So it's something that's keeping you stuck from growing to your full greatness.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to be very consciousness unless you understand Green's perspective without judgment. Your hatred of Green is simply your hatred of shadow aspects of yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You are the "Neo-Marxists" that you hate.

<title>Genghis Khan Enlightened?</title>

The Mongols did not just rape and pillage out of the blue. They gave their enemies many opportunities to surrender and join their empire peacefully.
</p>

<p>
	From today's era you can look at Genghis Kahn or Muhammad as a bloodthirsty warlord. But from their own eras, you can look at them as civilizing influences in their regions. As evil as an empire may appear, an empire is more evolved and civilized than a horde of warring tribes (who actually do a lot of random raping and pillaging).
</p>

<p>
	What most people fail to appreciate it what it takes to start a civilization. It doesn't happen through rainbows and butterflies. There was no United Nations back then, it had to be built from scratch.
</p>

<p>
	People like Saddam Hussein are not comic book villains as they are often portrayed. These leaders are rough and brutal because that is the kind of environment they are faced with. You cannot just bring democracy to people. They have to be evolved enough to handle it.
</p>

<p>
	Building a new civilization can be a dirty business.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I have no idea whether the Kahn was actually enlightened. If I had to bet, I would say not.
</p>

<p>
	The issue has never been a denial of post-modernism's or stage Green's limitations. OF COURSE they are limited. Every stage is limited in its own way. The greater mistake is to react against the limitation in a closedminded and egoic way.
</p>

<p>
	Post-modernism has it's limitations, but JP is overreacting to it, blowing it way out of proportion, which just polarizes people and creates a lack understanding.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to transcend Green by badmouthing Green. Most people who hate post-modernism are stuck in deep Blue/Orange, haven't bothered to actually read it, or think about its lessons. It's just an egoic judgmental reaction out of ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	JP is ensuring that stage Blue and Orange people stay stuck there forever by feeding their demonization of Green.
</p>

<p>
	Classic example of a red herring. Classic Spiral Dynamics trap: failure to fully integrate.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Soviet Communists/Marxists were not modern Green post-modernists. They were Blue ideologues closer to JP's audience than to SJWs.
</p>

<p>
	Oh the irony...
</p>

<title>Too much devotion to mooji</title>

<p>
	One of the downsides to the love-centered approach to nonduality is that it attracts a lot of love-bunnies, who become very devotional to the point of idol worship. Which then creates a sort of stage Green mob mentality, which mirrors stage Blue dogmatism.
</p>

<p>
	I have a friend who joined the Hare Krishnas, and it's this same kind of blind devotion mentality which leads to this kind of spiritual co-dependency. That's the danger of being part of a tight spiritual community. You become dependent on it and you stop thinking for yourself. This can easily lead to abuse and cult-like behavior, even if the guru is a nice person. Precisely what happened with Osho's community.
</p>

<p>
	The guru and his followers both become dependent on each other too much.
</p>

<p>
	A good guru will not let you worship him, keeping a professional distance from his students. Otherwise it becomes incestuous.
</p>

<p>
	I'm guessing Matt Kahn's followers fall into this same kind of trap given his style of teaching.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying anything negative about these gurus, just pointing out some common traps people fall into.
</p>

<p>
	Change is harder than most people expect.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that it doesn't work. It works too effectively. The problem is, you don't really want to change, and you're not addressing the root of your issues. No one has shown you how to actually APPLY self-help advice. So you're lost in theory and improper application.
</p>

<p>
	Victim mentality (which is what your entire post is), can be tricky to overcome. Especially when you are first starting out and you're deep in the hole from a lifetime of dysfunctional living.
</p>

<p>
	The good new is: the advice works and the end-results you can get are way beyond your wildest dreams. The bad news is: it will take lots of work to actualize it.
</p>

<p>
	Redouble your efforts, have hope, and drop your victim mentality.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Getting pissed is part of the process.

</p>

<p>
	Nor did I say that the mind is the only role in healing. I said "most", not all.
</p>

<p>
	You're the one making assumptions.
</p>

<p>
	The way you speak about the "physical" clearly tells me that you believe in physical reality. Otherwise you wouldn't be saying such things. So your level of consciousness is no secret to me.

Not always, but possible. Because your mind controls your immune system.
</p>

<p>
	But this is something you're not going to understand at your current level of consciousness. Because you still believe in a physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	The healing arts are a deep topic which takes years of study and practice to really fathom. And it takes a very open mind. There is a deep mystical component to healing, above and beyond the psychological and "physical" aspects.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like ADHD is definitely a good candidate for yogic healing. No guarantees, but worth a shot. Obviously the psychological and physical aspects should also be looked after. If you're eating bad food, that could be an important factor. But then again, yoga will purify your mind and chakras so much that you should automatically want to start eating healthier.

<p>
	I don't distinguish between psychedelics and non-psychedelics. It's all a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever your present state is, it is chemically induced. Ego is just chemicals at work.
</p>

<p>
	Any thought you have is a hallucination. Especially the thought, "But Leo, this is not a hallucination!"
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Chemistry itself is also a hallucination.

<p>
	The idea that astrology is a mass cultural delusion is itself a mass cultural delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Oh the irony...
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't conflate pop online horoscopes with serious astrology. If you're gonna do astrology, go to a real astrologist.

<p>
	Don't be so materialist.
</p>

<p>
	You've no idea yet what yoga can cure.

<p>
	Ain't so such thing as a "physical body" or "cause and effect".
</p>

<p>
	Most diseases are self-created by improper use of the mind.

That looks so much like a deep psychedelic trip.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's an infinite strange loop feeding into itself.
</p>

<p>
	That's sorta what infinity feels like, but without the visuals.

<p>
	Yup, that's exactly how it tends to go. Although 360ug is a massive amount of LSD.
</p>

<p>
	A wonderful substance.

It's the exact same video player.

<p>
	Maybe try Google Chrome browser.

<p>
	Ladies and gentlemen, let's set a good example for newbies here. Stop sniping at each other. It accomplishes nothing. Don't make your posts here personal.
</p>

<p>
	And any grudges you hold against another member, just drop it.
