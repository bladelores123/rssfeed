<p>
	Never mix 5-MeO with harmala. That is a lethal combo.

	Just because something feels good in the short term doesn't mean it's good for you in the long term.
</p>

<p>
	Drinking sugar water (Coke) makes you fat. Filling your body with heavily refined stuff like corn syrup is not wise.

<p>
	If you're in doubt it ain't a breakthrough. Just gradually up your dose until you get there.
</p>

<p>
	Never combine 5-MeO-DMT with MOAI.

<p>
	By big business I mean large corporations that deal with millions of customers.

<p>
	There are certain scales of biz which require very different approaches.
</p>

<p>
	$0 to $1mil
</p>

<p>
	$1mil to $5mil
</p>

<p>
	$5mil to $20mil
</p>

<p>
	$100mil+
</p>

<p>
	Those are very different beasts.
</p>

<p>
	To take your biz from $3mil to $20mil will require radically changing how you do business.

</p>

<p>
	Even on high doses of psychedelics I don't get that. I experience infinity but always as my own one life.

<p>
	I didn't start any large corporation, nor did I ever use investors to start my businesses.
</p>

<p>
	You just gotta be creative. You can run a small biz and do well.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you'll be working long hours to make your small biz thrive. Then you'll understand why long hours are common.
</p>

<p>
	There exist many opportunities for small businesses. There are many market niches which are too small to sustain large corporations so they can't compete with you.
</p>

<p>
	Business is just like the animal kingdom. The biggest animals are not the only game in town. In fact, most animals are small ones. You can be a highly successful small animal. But you gotta be more creative, clever, and strategic than the big guys.

<title>How the hell did Hegel know about non-dual/buddhist ideas?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/39617-how-the-hell-did-hegel-know-about-non-dualbuddhist-ideas/?do=findComment&amp;comment=496424</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The mistake is assuming Buddhism is somehow original. Buddhism just mirrors reality.
</p>

<p>
	Hegel doesn't need to know about Buddhism, he just need to be conscious of reality.
</p>

<p>
	He was a Christian and he deeply understood Christianity. Not as it's practiced today, but in the old school idealist mystical sense.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that a lot of old philosophers and scientists were more right about metaphysics than scientists are today precisely because they were Christians, and Christianity is grounded in the deepest truth there is. It just happens to also be very corrupt. So the real question is, How did Hegel manage to escape the corruption of Christianity?
</p>

<p>
	Hegel may not have been a meditator in the Buddhist sense, but he was obviously a deep contemplator and closely studied his direct experience. Which is the equivalent of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	He also deeply studied Heraclitus.
</p>

<p>
	When Heraclitus was asked, How did you become enlightened? He replied,
</p>

<p>
	"I studied myself."
</p>

<p>
	I would actually say just the opposite:
</p>

<p>
	All of your current dysfunctions in life are the result of past events.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so simple as correlating some one horrid childhood event to your current problem. It's much more complex. All problems are the result of whatever the "self" you identify as. This "self" was constructed as a reaction to survival challenges in the past. The "self" is nothing more than a survival mechanism. So of course it's highly conditioned by upbringing, childhood, teenage years, and early adulthood. Whatever stuff happened to you between the ages of 0 to 30 has shaped your personality almost totally to the point where you cannot even know what your self would be without it. Of course your are not just shaped by bad events but good events too.
</p>

<p>
	Of course none of this means you can't change.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bad idea to listen to academic psychologists when it comes to understanding the dynamics of the self. Broad surveys and studies are not gonna cut it here. This requires existential level insight through direct work on oneself.
</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself where your "self" came from? You'll see it was from the past. In fact, your entire mind came from the past. Every word you use came from your past. 99% of the ideas in your mind came from your past. You hardly invented anything new. You are like a snowball rolling down hill collecting more snow and dirt.
</p>

<p>
	But the strange looping twist here is, the past is just a figment of your mind! There never was a past or a self or a world! You made it all up. You sneaky devil, you.
</p>

<p>
	Survival has everything to do with your problems. Without survival there is no problem at all.
</p>

It basically is whatever we say it is.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel courageous you can post your pic on:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://hotornot.com/" rel="external nofollow">https://hotornot.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	And they will rate you from 0-10.
</p>

<p>
	But it would really be better for your self-esteem not to submit yourself to such mob evaluation of your self-worth. In the end you gotta love your genetics however they happen to be. Can't change that (yet).
</p>

<p>
	You must play with the hand life has dealt you.
</p>

<p>
	If it's of any consolation, all the "hot" people will eventually become not. So this is a bullet you'll have to bite at one point or another in life. You can't really avoid it. It's just a matter of time. It's a good idea not to base your self-esteem or happiness on your physical appearance. Or else you'll be in for a world of hurt.
</p>

<p>
	The great news is, you are not a physical being at all.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	On a practical level sleeping with lots of women is just unsustainable for many reasons. In the end you'll find it takes up way too much time and energy which could be put to better use.
</p>

<p>
	Consider, if you were truly happy, you'd have little need to sleep around with many women. Or really, any women at all.

<p>
	Indeed. If you were wise you'd see that happiness is all that matters and therefore fucking as many hot women as possible would cease to interest you. But as of now you're still to unconscious, immature, and needy to realize this.
</p>

<p>
	Your attachment is to your dick. So you're very much attached here.
</p>

<p>
	If you really wanted to be detached you'd give up sex altogether and never think of it again. This would be the wise move. But of course you're too unconscious to pull it off.

<p>
	It's not a matter of morality. It's just foolish, immature, and self-defeating.
</p>

<p>
	You are thinking with your dick. Which is not way of the sage.
</p>

<p>
	By all means, think with your dick as much as you want. But don't expect that to go well.
</p>

<p>
	The less you think with your dick, the better your life will go, the happier you'll be.
</p>

<p>
	It's counter-intuitive not to think with your dick.

<p>
	That's because "hot" is literally defined by that which is in the top 5%.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not that most women are not hot. It's that what's hot is the top 5% of whatever is.
</p>

<p>
	If women were donkeys, you'd still be like, "These donkeys suck. I want a better donkey."
</p>

<p>
	That's survival. Always looking for the most you can get for the least amount of effort.

			The head of these corporations make the laws. They could easily gather a bunch of lawyers to sue the government. That's why passive income gets taxed the least or 0%. Correct me if I'm wrong.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course corporations are a source of government corruption and rig the laws to serve their survival.
</p>

<p>
	But the problem is far deeper than that. Complex technology and massive scales of life (human society in the 100s of millions) requires massive infrastructure and collective forms of organization. We cannot just go back to living in little tribes in some hippie eco-village. The whole challenge here is that individual humans are not the end-all-be-all of life. Life has surpassed humans to include corporations, organizations, religions, social movements, cultures, governments, nations, and beyond. Massive complexity and bureaucracy is necessary to sustain things like nuclear weapons, gasoline cars, airports, highways, currency, the internet, GPS satellites, regulation of pollution & deforestation, regulation of endangered species, modern medicine, modern food, modern electronics, etc.
</p>

<p>
	None of that could exist without corporations or giant bureaucracies.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot build a modern home by yourself, or even with a small group of your friends. Modern housing construction requires sophisticated supply chains, regulation, infrastructure, factories, shipping containers, airports, railroad, power plants, mining, logging, and a thousand other things.
</p>

<p>
	Starbucks does better than a family owned coffee shop precisely because it solves complex organizational problems like supply chain issues, warehousing, etc. and it delivers a very reliable, high-quality product which people love.
</p>

<p>
	You must always take into account the problem of scale. Scale! Scale! Scale! is what people underestimate. It's very easy to run a small coffee shop that serves 100 customers. It's a whole nother design challenge to serve good coffee consistently to 1 billion customers. What worked at the scale of 100 does not work at the scale of 1 billion. It's a whole new creature. And we live in a world were business is done in the billions, not in the thousands. If business is not done in the billions, say goodbye to your car, your TV, your house, your phone, your computer, your internet, your video games, your fave TV shows, your GPS, your vacations, your books, etc.

</p>

<p>
	The way to solve that problem is reducing the incentives to milk.
</p>

<p>
	Passive income is not needed to escape wage slavery. Passive income is what causes wage slavery.
</p>

<p>
	In the future everyone will have to generate creative value or not get paid.
</p>

<p>
	Income should be tied to how much creative value you can generate. Being a landlord is not adding significant creative value to society. You're just basically taking advantage of the fact that you have more money than others to earn even more money. Which is like standing on someone's shoulders while kicking them in the teeth.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone has creativity. Don't give me that excuse. It is your job in life to actualize your creativity rather than becoming a parasite.

<p>
	If income from real eatate that you didn't live in was taxed highly, people would be much less incentivized to invest in it. Investing only works if there is a good ROI. So eating into that ROI will work nicely.
</p>

<p>
	Same with capital gains tax and passive income tax.

<p>
	There are some things government would not be good for, and I think housing might be one of them.
</p>

<p>
	There is enormous range in quality of housing and it all depends on location, build quality, management, and even the type of people who live in it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see how the government could realistically level the real eatate market. The market is too big and too wide. Prime land is super expensive. You can't just make it cheap or seize it from people who already own it.
</p>

<p>
	I think a better solution for this is UBI plus high taxes on real estate which is not lived in by the owner. There needs to be serious taxation and regulation of real eatate speculation to cut down on over-priced real estate. But NY and California will always be expensive places to live.
</p>

<p>
	I think housing development is best handled by private local companies because it is such a geographically specific thing.
</p>

<p>
	Hehehe... this is typical.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta lower your doses and contemplate reality on your trips a lot more. Do this over and over again on low doses (125ug) until you gain a deeper understanding of what consciousness is. Then you up your doses a bit.
</p>

<p>
	It takes 20, 50, 70 trips to start to make sense of how psychedelics work.
</p>

<p>
	1 or 2 trips is not nearly enough and there will be a lot of confusion at first because you have no idea yet how crazy powerful consciousness is.
</p>

<p>
	You can't turn to anyone for help with this because all humans are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, at times you will feel like you've totally lost your mind and gone completely insane. And yet you will be closer to Truth than ever in those moments. Don't doubt the trips. Doubt your sober state.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, but what I mean is you need a shift in your state of consciousness for real understanding to dawn.
</p>

<p>
	Ideas and thoughts about love are just not gonna cut it on this topic.

It's merely intellectual. You're not actually conscious of what Love is.
</p>

<p>
	It would be better for you to just admit you don't know what love is or why it is. You have some ideas, but they are just ideas.

	Yeah, if you wanna bang hot girls you're gonna have competition. Welcome to the jungle.

<p>
	You really expect hot girls for free?
</p>

<p>
	You are way too entitled. Attracting hot girls is a lot of work, and it must be that way because hot girls are valuable & rare.

<p>
	It's like you're asking us:

	How do I reconcile my desire to be healthy and fit with my desire for eating whatever garbage I feel like in any quantity?
</p>

<p>
	When you get serious about being healthy you will surrender your desire for junk food.

<title>How to get $180 000 for my Life Purpose Study</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	What most people don't realize is that earning $180k is not much easier than earning $5 million.
</p>

<p>
	To even create a business that sustainably earns $20k per year is not easy, and it will involve as much work as a business that earns a lot more. The money is the not main factor.
</p>

<p>
	You can't make a baby is 3 months just by wanting a small baby. There is a certain minimum that goes into building any sustainable brand. And it usually takes years at least.
</p>

<p>
	Chasing after schemes to make cash is not a good idea. If you're serious about making money you need to start a serious business. For that you should plan to invest 3-5 years of your life, full-time, at least.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot turn financial freedom into a formula. That will never work.
</p>

<p>
	You are talking about how to start a business. And business is all about creating a unique brand and niche, and adding massive value to people's lives.
</p>

<p>
	I have several videos about this:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Small Business Advice
	</li>
	<li>
		How To Escape Wage Slavery
	</li>
	<li>
		and my Life Purpose Course
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Of course this is only general advice. I don't teach business or marketing skills.

<p>
	That's right. God is absolute self-acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness cannot help but accept itself because it has no other option. To deny oneness requires a limited, dualistic consciousness which divides self into other.
</p>

<p>
	God loves you because God is you. God has no other to it, so it loves and accepts all. God is indiscriminate consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Indiscriminate consciousness is your true nature. That is enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12860-consilience/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="12860" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12860-consilience/" rel="">@Consilience</a> You are doing good, but you still have yet to realize Love / Absolute Self-Acceptance as your true nature. This is a very radical mystical state of consciousness. You could equate it to death, immortality, or total God-mode. It will be so epic your whole body will shudder in a cosmic orgasm. Keep following the scent trail and maybe one day you'll reach it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot with this.

<p>
	You are misunderstanding Infinity. It doesn't mean what you think it means.
</p>

<p>
	You are never going to figure this out using logic, as you are trying to do.
</p>

<p>
	All of your logic is dualistic and relative.
</p>

<p>
	You can say "1+1=2 is absolute" or "we don't know", but all of that is a relative construction of the ego-mind.

<p>
	There is no such thing as Buddhism. There is Buddhism as interpreted by a mind. Buddhism is often taught in dogmatic ways or misinterpreted by the unawakened mind.
</p>

<p>
	There have been plenty of people on this forum (even some who claim to be awake) who deny the existential nature of Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not merely a heart awakening. Love = Truth, and many people are denial about that because they simply have not become conscious enough to realize that facet of God.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening goes much deeper than people realize. There is so much depth and so many facets of it that they are easy to miss. Many people fool themselves into thinking they have seen it all. And they refuse to listen when they are told they are missing some important facet.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter what the scriptures say because most people don't read them, or read them yet misunderstand them, or read them but never have direct consciousness of what they point to. Scriptures tend to be dry and fall on deaf ears.
</p>

<p>
	Dogmatic Buddhism is a common thing. There are a thousand times more Buddhists than awakened people. So all this is to be expected.
</p>

<p>
	What I teach, and Buddhism, are not the same thing. There are important differences even though the general direction is similar.
</p>

<p>
	You're talking about the brain training program? I don't know exactly what it offers, but it certainly doesn't offer awakening.

I'm not sure if it will dissolve in that, but DMSO (Dimethylsulfoxide) is usually used as a solvent to allow something to be absorbed through the skin. You mentioned that DPT doesn't really dissolve in water. DMSO may need to be diluted. I read to make sure everything is clean because it can carry dirt into the body too.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There's no need.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter if it doesn't dissolve in the water. It will still absorb just fine. Just suck it up into the oral syringe. The particles of DPT will be suspended in the water.

<p>
	Probably. Do some online research of what people snort.
</p>

<p>
	I find snorting and plugging dosages to be similar potency for psychedelics in general. You should never compare oral dosages to snorting or plugging because they are totally different.

But lower your dosages. It can be intense.
</p>

<p>
	For some people plugging doesn't work. Probably a genetic thing.

	There is nothing but mind stuff. Nothing is more real than anything else.

<p>
	It's interesting that when Steve Bannon was asked internally about Trump winning in 2020, he didn't even consider it a possibility.
</p>

<p>
	Internally they know Trump is fucked. His numbers are just terrible and he's not gonna be able to spin his way out of that the hole he's dug for himself. The media is not doing a good job of reporting on Trump's terrible record-low numbers. They keep acting as if Trump is a normal president with normal popular support. This is not the case. Trump is the most unpopular president of all time.

<title>New Girlfriend With Severe Depression</title>

<p>
	I've been in that exact situation before.
</p>

<p>
	It's gonna be really hard to make that work.
</p>

<p>
	Usually serious depression, anxiety, and low self esteem are a sign of some deeper trauma which she is avoiding/denying. Often it could be sexual abuse, rape, death of mother or father, etc. Serious stuff. This tends to go hand in hand with alcohol and substance abuse. So watch out.
</p>

<p>
	Such women get very needy, very clingy, very emotional, and they are almost impossible to help because they perceive suggestions to get help as an attack on their identity. As in, "Why don't you love me for who I am?!!!" A needy person is so desperate for love they cannot handle truth. The slightest suggestions for self-improvement trigger them. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy effect where their fear of being abandoned makes them so clingy that no healthy relationship is possible, thereby leading to abandonment, reinforcing the idea in their mind that they are unlovable. No serious communication is possible because such people cannot handle truthful communication. They want fantasy and sweet lies.
</p>

<p>
	Such people need deep therapeutic help, enormous self-help work, and lots of spiritual development. Unfortunately they tend to refuse any such thing -- making their relationship impossible.
</p>

<p>
	And finally when you try to end the relationship, there will be huge waterworks and the threat of suicide.
</p>

<p>
	Try to see what you can do. Try introducing her to some basic self-help and self-esteem work. But also understand that this person has deep inner wounds which you probably cannot fix. Such wounds usually take 10-20 years to resolve, and that's IF the person is interested in working on herself.
</p>

<p>
	Try to figure out what the root cause of her depression / anxiety is. Usually it's a traumatic childhood or teenage event. She is likely to hide such an event from you because she's scared that if you find out you will leave her. Such women often lie a lot to themselves and therefore will lie to you. It's part of her coping strategy to avoid deep truth or deep self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
	In practice such women can only be in highly dysfunctional relationships until they do some serious self-help work.
</p>

<p>
	If she has serious low self-esteem, chances are high she's got a history of abusive relationships. Try to dig into her history to get a sense of what you're dealing with. It could be some dark stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Don't blame yourself. Some women are just like this and cannot be helped until they seek help for themselves.
</p>

<p>
	I know a sexual hypnosis technique where a girl can visualize and experience the orgasm of a man.
</p>

<p>
	You can orgasm without even physical stimulation.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is all about how you use your mind.

	After he won the Republican primary, I was worried he'd beat Hillary. He was just the type of guy average low-education Americans would vote for and we had 8 years of the Dems, so people would be looking for change.
</p>

<p>
	The difference now is that people are much more familiar with who Trump is. The only reason Trump won was because people did not know how much of a con artist he was. They bought into his fake image of a successful businessman while the media did a terrible job of explaining how much of fraud Trump was and disastrous his leadership would be. But now I think most voters understand the incompetency of Trump.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, Trump will always have a solid base of 40%. But that is not enough to win an election. The only way to win is to fool the 10% of swing voters. And he's not gonna be able to pull that off again. And the Dems and minorities now should be very energized, much more so than in 2016. The Dems were way too complacent in 2016. They didn't take Trump seriously enough.
</p>

<p>
	I foresee a continuation of the 2018 Blue Wave. 90%+ chance that Trump loses, but chances of winning the Senate are still bad.
</p>

<p>
	If it's Bernie vs Trump, I predict Bernie wins in a landslide.
</p>

<p>
	Warren vs Trump will be more problematic. But I still feel that basically any Dem will beat Trump in 2020.

<p>
	You awaken and realize that you are the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	This is why it's good to have an attitude of seeking Truth for truth's sake. Whatever the Truth turns out to be, you should already have resolved in your mind that you will accept it. Why? Simply because it's the Truth. Nothing else matters. That's the best attitude for this work. This makes things simple. You don't have to worry so much this way. You have faith that the Truth will solve all problems.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is like a compass you can rely on at all times.

<p>
	That's easy. God does not recognize evil because it doesn't judge itself.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to evil is to realize it is a projection of the ego-mind. Of course this is a not a solution your ego-mind likes.

<p>
	Well, the most obvious difference is duration. LSD will last twice as long.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms are more twisted, more deranged, more organic & earthy.
</p>

<p>
	Both can be equally intense, depending on dosage. For me LSD has some unpleasant body load, more so than mushrooms.

<p>
	Walsh, this guy, is such a joke.
</p>

<p>
	The funniest thing is, all these people who denounce Trump as having bad moral character are still for all of his policies. The only thing they don't like about him is his nasty Tweeting. They dislike the way he makes conservatives look, but they like the ethnocentric stage Blue & hyper-capitalism Orange core.
</p>

<p>
	This is to fail to learn the lesson of Trump. Trump's surface nastiness is the least of the problem.

<p>
	Once Trump is out everyone who supported him will deny they ever really supported him. Even people in his admin will come up with a story about how they were only pretending to go along with him to help save a bad situation from catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
	There will be some epic denial going on in right-wing circles.
</p>

<p>
	There's already a lot of denial in the never-Trump right-wing circles where these never-Trumpers delude themselves into believing that Trump is not a true conservative and that he's some kind of anomaly of conservativism and doesn't represent the "real" conservative base.
</p>

<p>
	All this is ideology 101.
</p>

<p>
	And in 50 years, no one will understand how Trump was supported by anyone. The whole dynamic of ideology will be denied by the public mind.
</p>

<p>
	After a certain point the horror becomes so great that you automatically surrender.
</p>

<p>
	Or you don't and you become highly dysfunctional.

<p>
	Do all the practices diligently and slowly you will transcend various personal needs.
</p>

<p>
	Or you can also exhaust them to death. Like, go have so much sex you get sick of it. Or go earn so much money that you stop caring about money.

<title>Is Enlightenment beyond experiencing?</title>

<p>
	The very notion of "experience" is dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	Yet that does not mean that colors and sounds must cease to reach Truth or God.
</p>

<p>
	God is whatever is the case. So if you see red, that's God. If you see nothing at all, that too is God.
</p>

<p>
	People report total loss of sensation sometimes, but that's not necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I suffer.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get stupid ideas about me.
</p>

<p>
	People love to build up fantasies of their gurus being invincible and superhuman. Stop doing that. Treat gurus as ordinary people. Enlightened masters are a lot more ordinary than you imagine them to be.

	The difference is, I am teaching how to avoid the traps of ideology and I do not teach that I am above you. You are as much God as I am. So I build no hierarchy with my teachings.

<p>
	And I share my tools with you.
</p>

<p>
	The chemical potion makes God accessible to all (or to most). Unlike in religion where gurus have an advantage over you. This is the beauty of psychedelics. They are the ultimate equalizer and breaker of hierarchies of power. In this sense psychedelics are like the internet.

<p>
	Not ultimately true because God is omnipresent, since it is prior to space or position, which are relative things.
</p>

<p>
	If you become even more conscious you should notice that God is not located anywhere and that it is equally in all parts of your body. Your entire body is made out of God. Notice your hands especially next time.

	That's right, the devil is only a relative illusion. All devils are actually God.

<p>
	Relatively, there are devils.
