	Muscle testing is not a reliable method. It's too prone to confirmation bias and self-deception.

<p>
	Blue-Yellow is an oxymoron. You probably just aren't familiar enough with the stages yet.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you're Blue-Yellow, you're probably Blue but like to think of yourself as higher.

<p>
	Privacy rights are important to fight for. But this particular battle has been lost long ago at the business/consumer level. It needs to be waged at the federal level with privacy laws and regulations.

			People who talk smack about Peterson never give an alternative option to him. At least he reaches out to incels and tries to help them out. People find his books very helpful. Personally I don't have to agree on everything to learn something from him. He helped a lot incels get out of their cave and start a family. In a sense I think his stuff could help incels more than actualized stuff.

<p>
	Dude, there are so many better alternatives to JP that it's hard to know where to start listing them.
</p>

<p>
	Literally walk into any bookstore, ask for the self-help aisle, pick any random self-help book from the shelf and it will be better than listening to JP.
</p>

<p>
	The people who are awed by JP have simply never read any self-help authors or teachers.

	You realize that your ISP can read all your chats and web history whenever they want??
</p>

<p>
	People have this silly double-standard when it comes to Facebook.
</p>

<p>
	Companies have had your data for decades now. This is nothing new. Your bank knows your entire purchase history. And the NSA has back-channel deals with all these companies to see your data.

	There is no such thing as evil men. It's the good ones who create evil when their consciousness lapses.

<p>
	Even Trump is not an evil man. He's just deeply wrapped up in a wounded ego that never received the proper love.

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	These people are brainwashed by the right-wing populist conspiracy theory alt-media echo-chamber.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just fringe stuff though, it's also FoxNews and the like. Basically any right-wing media source in the last 4 years. Including stuff like Tim Pool, Brietbart, Ben Shapiro, Charlie Kirk, Jordan Peterson, etc. consuming all that trash ideology adds up to mind-cancer. Their sense of reality is so delusional and reactionary that they have lost all sense of decency and common sense. In their minds their actions are fully justified because they legit believe that pedophile communists are taking control of America. That is their worldview in a nutshell.

			If that is the case, Trump is not the only who is responsible for this civil strife. This has been a long time coming and it's all due to the avalanche of right wing propaganda that has been circulating the internet since it's inception. People don't know what to believe anymore, and a lot of normal everyday people have been radicalized by these kind of ideas and are complicit in this coup. This is bigger than just this one event.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, of course. But Trump was a huge assemblage point for all the worst right-wing tendencies.
</p>

<p>
	Trump basically took stages Orange and Blue and appealed to their deepest and lowest fears, insecurities, gripes, hatred, anger, greed, racism, and nationalism. And they swallowed his con hook, line, and sinker because it felt so good for their egos to get validated. It's like dangling red meat before a starved beast.
</p>

<p>
	That is the epitome of demagoguery.
</p>

<p>
	Hitler did the same thing in 1920's Germany.

</p>

<p>
	Can it be done within a week or two?
</p>

<p>
	And what do you think Trump will do during those two weeks where he sees that he's being kicked out? He will go into hardcore attack mode. He will take off the gloves. He will fill his entire cabinet with fascist goons and loyalists and they will fight it as though they were fighting a real coup attempt. Is that worth it?

			Will you be sharing any of these DMT insights & experiences in the future?  I'm personally very curious how 5-MeO prepared / altered your DMT experiences and what you take away from them.  I've experienced the utterly infinite complexity of DMT, but often have struggled to feel love or understanding inside of it, usually coming away from these trips mostly just baffled and a little scared.

<p>
	I have already shared many of them and continue to do so. I prefer to share my trips less explicitly these days. The insights are abstracted from the trip or substance. I'm not so interested these days of giving detailed trip reports.

	That's just an excuse you imagined so that you remain inside the dream.

<p>
	Realize deeper that your family and their suffering is just a dream you are hallucinating to keep yourself away from Infinite Love.

	What that is, is just fear of Infinite Love and formlessness.

	Not at all.
</p>

<p>
	All that would do is kick him out of the White House.
</p>

<p>
	He would not be charged with any serious crime or face prison time.
</p>

<p>
	To put him in prison requires a long ass legal trail that will last years, and you need a hard crime like tax fraud.
</p>

<p>
	The current Justice Department rule is: You literally cannot charge an active President with ANY crime!
</p>

<p>
	Trump could shoot someone in the White House and he would not be chargable.

<p>
	It's the dumbest thing ever thought up by mankind.

			<strong>Pasting this:</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			"Courtesans were a part of a thriving culture of women who were learned, witty and wealthy. They wrote and performed music; they painted and danced. They provided men with intelligent conversation, artistic pleasure and sex. Courtesans were  different in many ways. They were not tied down to a husband and could enjoy the attentions of many men whenever they liked. They were also able to speak their minds on any subject, and were able to speak and think freely along any route they chose.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ancient Greece and ancient Rome both had courtesans as a very prominent part of the way the social fabric operated," Feldman said. "So did most places in the Far East and South Asia, India and Renaissance Italy."
		</p>

		<p>
			In Renaissance Italy, Feldman's field of study, courtesans maintained salons "where there was elevated conversation about philosophical issues, intellectual issues, theories of life and beauty," she said. "Some [courtesans] were among the best-educated and most literate and cultured women of their time."
		</p>

		<p>
			"The cultivated courtesan was a very refined, educated type of woman," said Doris Srinivasan, an art historian at the University of Memphis who will present a paper on courtesans in India. "She was respected; she had status; her position was not a degraded one. She was a woman of generosity, of wealth, of integrity, of education."
		</p>

		<p>
			Sex was also used as a way of gaining power and prestige. Courtesans were usually highly educated and well versed in the etiquette of the time but they were also independent and able to express themselves as no other women could.
		</p>

		<p>
			A courtesan or lorette was in control of her own life. She decided what lovers to take and she decided what was acceptable for her to do or say. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It seems as though selling one's body is a small price to pay for the amount of freedom that was allowed to courtesans. The courtesan who, in choosing her profession had already rejected society's constraints and was thus able to live in an open and free manner.
		</p>

<p>
	Interesting take.

<p>
	Those are gonna be very difficult to prove in court.
</p>

<p>
	Treason is technically when you collude with a foreign power during a time of war. That won't apply here.
</p>

<p>
	And we've already established that the US President is above all criminal prosecution while in office. The Justice Department cannot even issue a criminal charge of a sitting US President.

<p>
	25th Amendment is possible if his most loyal cabinet decide to throw him under the bus.
</p>

<p>
	Once Republicans realize that Trump is about to lose all his power anyway, they may rapidly turn on him and throw him under the bus to save themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Soon will begin the phase where everyone who enabled and supported Trump will start to deny that they were really supporters of his.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, all of this will be denied by those who enabled it. It's just a matter of time. Once Trump loses power it could happen very quickly.

<p>
	Or the police were simply outnumbered at the moment and didn't want to incite mob violence.
</p>

<p>
	Police often allow a mob to overrun an area. We certainly saw this in the BLM riots. You can't stop a mob without full riot gear and hundreds of police in a wall.
</p>

<p>
	Looks like MAGA blitz the Capitol with a move so bold and shameless that it caught the police off guard. That's the point of a facsist blitz.

<p>
	I don't even see how the 25th Amendment applies here. Trump is not unable to do his job. He's just an egotistical asshole. Same as he was for 4 years when he was democratically elected.
</p>

<p>
	Can the 25th Amendment be used on grounds that the President is a pathological narcissist? Because that is really his only problem.

	We can since some people just add so much more value to the world that others. Not per se billionaires but millionaires.
</p>

<p>
	But it needs to be regulated better for sure.
</p>

<p>
	Don't focus on capping wealth. Just regulate and tax it properly.

<p>
	I have not found any methods that work well for me other than long and tedious-as-fuck full-time meditation retreats.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically you need 100 hours straight of uninterrupted mindfulness concentration.
</p>

<p>
	But even then, you will fall out of that state once you stop the retreat. Changing one's baseline is the hardest thing.

What I'm talking about requires deep contemplation and probing. Weak people will stop long before they get that far. Psychedelics tend to be self-regulating. You go too deep, you freak out, and you swear them off forever because you're not serious about Truth.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, psychedelics are dangerous for sure. Extreme caution required. You could seriously fuck up your mind if you don't know what you're doing.

<p>
	Well, this will vary from person to person.
</p>

<p>
	For me, personally, psychedelics have not increased my baseline state much at all. But they have helped me understand reality at staggering levels of depth that no guru or video or book ever could. I used psychedelics to solve the ultimate riddle of existence. I became completely omniscient. The entire universe makes sense to me now.

<p>
	People don't believe and skip all the warnings anyways. And I'm sick of giving out warnings all the time. Half my videos are warnings about traps.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual work will fuck your mind up bad no matter how you slice it. That's the nature of the game. If you don't want to face death, don't do spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality = facing your own death head-on and coming out the other end. Anything shy of that is not serious spirituality, it's delay tactics.

<p>
	You mean effectively sex slaves?
</p>

<p>
	If you're talking about ancient cultures -- they all strictly controlled women's sexuality so that the most powerful men got the hottest women by the dozen on command at any time of day.
</p>

<p>
	The sexual marketplace has been carefully manipulated and dominated by powerful men for thousands of years to maximize their own survival.
</p>

<p>
	If you give powerful men the freedom to do so, they will hoard all the hot women for themselves and turn them into sex slaves. That is survival 101 for a man. Hot women are worth more than their weight in gold. That's why it happens unless there are strict laws and morals against it. And even so -- it still happens today.
</p>

<p>
	Never underestimate how far or how low a man will go for hot sex. If he's told to murder someone, he'll do it.
</p>

<p>
	The peak of my game was a Vegas 30-day challenge. I beasted full-time for 30 days straight in Vegas, 5 hours per night. I did something like 750+ approaches in that month. I even approached with a cold fever and dripping nose. In fact that night I got laid. I was having sex and wiping my snotty nose on the rough sofa pillow because my nose would not stop running in the middle of sex. It was unreal and not so pleasant. But it was training. My wingman was nailing her friend in the same hotel room. The four of us slept in the same bed.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah... that's beast-mode in Vegas. Off the hook. Crazy shit goes down here.

	450 cold approaches to get my first lay.
</p>

<p>
	But keep in mind: 1) I sucked hard, 2) most of these approaches were short 20-60 second interactions, not 30 minute long sets, 3) your numbers will improve a lot after the first year of failure.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind this is a sample size of 1. My brother got a girlfriend from his 1st cold approach! So it's rather random. You never know when luck will strike.

			How many girls would you approach in a typical night?

</blockquote>

<p>
	Depends. When I was doing it seriously I would go about every night that clubs were open in the city I was in. Sometimes 3 nights per week. Sometimes 7 nights per week for a whole month. It all depends on what opportunities are available in your area and how serious you are. 2 nights per week should be minimum. That's typically Fri & Sat. You'll need to check your city and venues to see if it's worth making the trip out there on weekdays. Many times it's not worth it if you live in a small city.
</p>

<p>
	Typical night: 5, 10, or 20 girls. Depends on how busy the venue was. Some nights are just slow so you can't approach 20 girls. Sometimes you only get 5 or so. 10 per night is a great number to shoot for. But some nights it will only be 3 or 5 just because it was slow or you were chickening out.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 to doing massive approaching is that you need to find specific venues and cities that offer that opportunity. Your average bar does not have 10 girls worth approaching.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Sure it is. My first two wingmen were two black guys in Dallas. Both of them got laid more than me because they were more experienced and had better game.
</p>

<p>
	Will you have a disadvantage with white girls? Sure, probably. But it doesn't really matter when you talk to 30 girls a night. You don't need to bang every girl you meet. You only need 1 per night to be down.
</p>

<p>
	If you're a black guy and you want a hot white girlfriend, this isn't a problem because all you gotta do is filter through 500 hot white girls until you find a few that love you. Is it worth it? Sure it is. You can do that in a few months.
</p>

<p>
	Remember.... you're not out to bang the whole female race. You're just looking for a handful of women. A handful out of thousands. This makes your goal much easier.
</p>

<p>
	When I was practicing game, it's even worth it to approach 300 pound whales. You are just being social and having fun. Lower your standards for socialization and approach. Just because you approach does not mean you need to end up having sex with her. She might have a cute friend.
</p>

<p>
	APPROACH ALL! -- should be your motto. Young, old, hot, fat, man, woman, gay, straight -- doesn't matter. Just approach and socialize. Sort the wheat from the chaff later.
</p>

<p>
	So put your money where your mouth is.
</p>

<p>
	But also, it shouldn't matter since you're doing a simple A/B split test with only one variable difference. You can do that for free on OkCupid or whatever online dating site. I have set up fake accounts in the past for both men and women, just to see how many messages I get. It's extremely eye-opening and depressing. Unless you're very good-looking it will kill your self-esteem.

<p>
	Yes, of course. What do you expect? To go from Zen master to Russell Brand in the snap of the fingers? You are not going to excel in all areas of life. Pick your battles. If you want to master socialization that's gonna take serious work and I'm not the one to teach you that -- find specialists and do lots of practice.

<p>
	It's not just an ideology. Most humans are not that far from animals when it comes to how they have sex.
</p>

<p>
	Sex CAN be done consciously. But is it? Mostly no. Hence sex gets a bad rap.
</p>

<p>
	An important aspect of spiritual development is getting your sex drive under control. You can't do spiritual work when you are a horny dog who can't focus on higher concerns.

<p>
	Small tribal life is very different from modern society. A small tribe is like a family. There are strong intimate bonds between all the people so that keeps you in check. In a modern society anonymity removes all those checks. Hence norms and laws are necessary.

<p>
	Most cultures stigmatize promiscuity because it actually is dangerous to one's survival. Sexual desire is such a powerful force that if it is not properly regulated it can lead to ruin and disaster. All societies that ever exists needed to regulate sexuality, whether through laws or cultural norms or morality. Usually all 3 are required.
</p>

<p>
	This is not merely a Western or Christian thing. Strict sexual rules exist in all cultures. You can't just go sleeping around and expect there not to be social consequences.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that it's shamed because sex is so often and so easily abused. If you had a teenage daughter you would not look too kindly at her sleep around with a bunch of horny idiot jocks. Your daughter's social survival depends on her not being perceived as a dirty slut.

	There are literally dozens of things to check. Don't just sit around wondering. Start reading and doing research. And not just some free bullshit online articles. You need to do serious research and trouble-shooting here. You could have liver disorders, thyroid disorders, hormone imbalances, viruses, bacteria, gut disorders, vitamin deficiencies, mold, sleep disorders like sleep apnea, dozens of different autoimmune disorders, etc. All these things need to be checked and excluded conclusively one by one.

And now that he's proven a market for MAGA ideology, some other young politician will emerge to seize on the opportunity. Looking at you, Josh Hawley. It's already happening. People are sitting around in offices right now strategizing how to hijack the MAGA movement once Trump is out. These guys will be thinking, "How can we do what Trump did, but this time without his incompetence, buffoonery, and outright vulgarity?"
</p>

<p>
	The billion dollar question is: Can the MAGA movement be led by someone who is not an outright clown and buffoon? Or is that inherently the appeal that makes MAGA so hot. If they can manage to sanitize it by making it not look so outright clownish, they will fool even more people into buying it.
</p>

<p>
	What does MAGA look like without Trump? Can it still exist? Or is the buffoonery and vulgarity the core appeal?
</p>

	Crazy can't be kept up forever. Things will temper out. When all these crazy conservatives lose a bunch of elections all over the place the lesson will be re-learned that crazy Republicans can't win. And so moderates will come to the fore like George W. Bush. And they will have much better chances of winning.

	Don't bullshit me. Being bald is certainly a disadvantage in dating hot women. Don't use this as an excuse. You can still date hot women while bald. But it's harder. You will have to have better game.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	1) Although I am very introverted I really enjoy deep intimate relationships. It's a bit of a paradox, but not really. Introverts like few relationships but they are deeper. We trade off breadth for depth.
</p>

<p>
	So while you may think that I don't go deep with intimacy, the opposite is the case. When I'm with a girl, I give her my full attention because I don't scatter my social energy around in 50 different ways. And I'm not with a girl often so it feels much more special.
</p>

<p>
	2) As an introvert you need to make plenty of space for alone time. Don't constantly be together for long periods of time.
</p>

<p>
	3) Dating an introvert is helpful because she too will appreciate her space and alone time and she won't be interested in highly social activities like clubbing or partying. Two deep introverts can make for a great combo. And there are plenty of introverted girls.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	It's just a different struggle.
</p>

<p>
	There is no greater myth than when guys believe: "It's unfair, women have it easy because they can just go to a bar and get banged by some random dude, but I as a guy can't do the the same with hot women."

<p>
	Don't worry. Democracy is not so fragile. It's dictatorship that's truly fragile.
</p>

<p>
	The US' bureaucracy is too advanced to allow a coup or dictatorship to occur. That's my best bet.
</p>

<p>
	Of course we must still remain on-guard. Can't let the guard down.
</p>

<p>
	My biggest worries are what happens in 4 years if Biden is not successful and MAGA re-surges. MAGA might morph in ugly ways in the future. It really is like a cornered wild animal -- you don't know quite how to handle it and you can't just ignore it. I don't see these people just melting away like spring snow.

<p>
	It's a good stress-test of our systems. I don't take the threat too seriously at this point. There will be a lot of huffing and puffing but little bite because I don't think Trump is competent or ruthless enough to pull it off. He's not harsh enough to be a dictator. He's a phony, reality-TV, con-man -- not a real dictator. Which is why I've never worried that he would stage a real coup. He's a buffoon and this is his ego's coping strategy.
</p>

<p>
	His MAGA cult is dangerous, though. They will not pull off a successful coup, but they can cause damage in other ways so they need to be carefully contained like a wild animal.

<p>
	I would say no. Things could always get much worse. Nothing seriously bad has happened yet.
</p>

<p>
	This storming of the Capitol is ultimately just for show. It's not a serious threat yet. Things could be driven much worse if push comes to shove.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, MAGA are deluded. But it's important not to provoke a deluded person too much.
</p>

<p>
	Right now we have the moral and legal high ground. We need to keep it. Let MAGA make fools of themselves. Don't be too reactive. Simply uphold the laws. That's all we need. Starting a war with MAGA is what MAGA extremists would love.

<p>
	If Trump is kicked out early using some 25th Amendment, that will feed the MAGA paranoia of a coup against Trump. This will drive the MAGA extremists and conspiracy theorists wild as they will feel like all that Alex Jones stuff has come true. Not sure how wise that is at this late stage. Might be best to wait it out and have him leave under the classic conditions so MAGA have no claim of an establishment coup against Trump.
</p>

<p>
	The psychology here is very tricky. When you are dealing with a crazy person, if you completely disregard his crazy view of the world, it might come back to bite you. It is the burden of the sane person to take the insane person's insanity seriously in asymmetrical fashion -- which is part of what makes him sane and reasonable. So it's important not to totally piss off the MAGA crowd, precisely because they are batshit nuts.

<p>
	Some narrow criticisms are. But many of the criticisms of police that I hear from progressives are just coming from ignorance of how policing works.
</p>

<p>
	To truly criticize the police effectively one would need a lot of experience in the field. Because it's a management and training problem. Specific and laser-targetted reforms are needed, not vague slogans.

<p>
	In a certain sense, of course. Why else would you eat? You eat because you are attached to material existence and material existence makes certain demands of you. That's the cost of existing on Earth. If you are cool with existing elsewhere, then maybe you can stop eating. I doubt a DMT entity needs to eat, but it only exists in DMT space.

<p>
	You can't transcend all biological limits so long as you wish to remain a biological being. You can certainly transcend everything biological, the only question is what will remain of you? If you wish to exist on this Earth then you may have to put up with many biological limits, like having to take a shit.
</p>

<p>
	The limits we're most interested in transcending here are not biological but psychological. And many of those you can certainly transcend. Nothing crazy about that.

<title>Are psychedelics ULTIMATELY a distraction?</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The logic of this is very simple:
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are ultimately a distraction only if all teachings and techniques ever taught are ultimately a distraction.
</p>

<p>
	If you are going to argue against psychedelics, that's fine. But then stop being a hypocrite and apply all your same arguments to every book, video, guru, ashram, teacher, retreat, workshop, seminar, school, podcast, etc. Because all of these are technologies invented to speed up an otherwise nearly-impossible process.
</p>

<p>
	Without any of these technologies the odds of you awakening would be zero. You would have to be lucky enough to stumble into it by accident.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, even the Buddha and Jesus had lots of training. They used many radical techniques. They didn't just stumble into it.
</p>

<p>
	Again, to be fair here, progressive protesters burn shit down, vandalize stuff, and occupy government property too. So it's more than just slogans. Civil rights riots do happen and property gets damaged and some people even die.
</p>

<p>
	But they are not equal to MAGA buffoonery. MAGA is in a league of its own.
</p>

<p>
	The difference is that Civil Rights is a legit cause to fight for. Overthrowing democracy just so Trump can have a 2nd term is not.

<p>
	This is stretching it. Most police are professionals with integrity, not MAGA buffoons and degenerates. Sure, police generally skew conservative, but conservative != MAGA.
</p>

<p>
	It's very important that we don't make the cliche progressive YouTuber mistake of demonizing all conservatives as MAGA idiots because conservatives will be around for another 1000 years, and we need to leave room open for a healthy and reason conservative party. The conservative party cannot be eliminated. But MAGA buffoons can. We need to build a pathway out of MAGA and back into healthy mainstream conservativism because these people will definitely not turn progressive.
</p>

<p>
	I know it's shocking, but conservativism and idiocy can be independent variables. You can be conservative without being batshit crazy.
</p>

<p>
	I would frame it as:
</p>

<p>
	Getting rid of police is like trying to cure a tree from pests by ripping out its roots.
</p>

<p>
	This analogy properly shows the foolishness of the strategy. The cure should not be worse than the disease.

<p>
	Getting rid of pests requires a delicate touch, not a chainsaw.

<p>
	#HumanePolicing
</p>

<p>
	The message needs to be uplifting and quasi-spiritual. You need to win the moral high-ground on this one.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Green's meanness is showing up here. Mean Green as Wilber calls it. There's definitely some truth to that. Green fails without compassion. Compassion for police is important. They do hard work for little pay and they are mostly good people. Blaming and demonizing cops is a bad move. Police should not be demonized any more than your child who got a bad grade in math class.

<p>
	#HumanizePolicing
</p>

<p>
	That's the crux of what's needed. That's the solution.
</p>

<p>
	Who is gonna say NO! to Should we humanize the police? Do you want an inhuman police-force in your town? Check mate!
</p>

<p>
	Your political propositions need to resonate with positivity. If your message is easy to misunderstand or demonize, you've lost. I am progressive but even I cringed the first time I heard Defund The Police. And I still cringe when I hear it because then I have to clarify to people, "I am very progressive, but I'm not naive and impractical like those socialist hippies."

<p>
	I know that. But some extreme progressives go so far as want more than that. Some talk of disbanning the police. The problem is that they few make the rest of the movement look dumb and nonsensical. This is similar to socialists screaming: open boarders. Welp, Covid shut them up real fast.
</p>

<p>
	And besides, the slogan is misleading and terrible.
</p>

<p>
	If what you want is to cut down on over-policing, then make that your slogan: Stop over-policing. Or better yet something positive like: Better training for police.
</p>

<p>
	Then police will be onboard with that.
</p>

<p>
	How are police gonna feel when you yell to defund them? How can police be supportive of progressives? They can't when you put their survival on the line like that. It would be like if I told a mother: Don't support your child. She would never listen to me again after that because it sounds so against her entire point of existence. When you create existential threats for people, expect them to react like cornered animals.

<p>
	You don't need to research world traditions to realize that you have both masculine and feminine aspects to your psyche. This is like saying you need to talk to a French-trained chef in order to know that you enjoy sweet and salty food both, and that there is a complex and important interplay between the two in most dishes.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that every good dessert recipe calls for some salt.

<p>
	Just to be fair, those progressives calling to defund/disban the police are also hypocrites and fools. Today TYT is yelling about why the police didn't show up sooner. Talk about hypocrisy.
</p>

<p>
	If you defund the police, how are they gonna protect you from an armed MAGA coup?
</p>

<p>
	Police need to be well-funded and well-armed. But also well-trained.
</p>

<p>
	The progressive slogan to defund the police is probably the clearest example of stage Green stupidity. I understand that they mostly mean to reallocate funds to social work and the like, but a social worker is not gonna stop a crowd of MAGA idiots. That slogan -- defund the police -- is like political suicide.

	In the biggest picture Trumpism is actually good because it will teach society important lessons about epistemology, democracy, social media, and late-stage capitalism. All of these lessons have still not been deeply integrated by most of society. Hitler served an analogous function. These are negative case-studies for posterity. Society learns what is right by fucking up for all to see. It is not enough for us to fuck up individually, we must also fuck up collectively to learn collectively.

<p>
	Yes, it's a perfect storm of shit: internet technology and late-stage capitalism with a stage Green shadow.
</p>

<p>
	Under capitalism businesses are incentivized to infect the minds of their audience with garbage because it makes such good money.
</p>

<p>
	Facebook, YT, CNN, and FoxNews are making a killing off all this ideological garbage and drama. Nobody at these companies cares about the epistemic and mental health of the country's citizenry. Because there's no incentive to care. In a democracy citizens need healthy, educational, high-consciousness sources of information. But under late-stage capitalism people are fed a McDonald's-like diet of garbage social media memes and drama. The information diet in our society has as much nutritional value as a can of Coke.

			I think the crux of it is that we have to figure out what motivated them emotionally to project onto Trump in this way, where he is their savior and leader. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This is what makes people susceptible to cults... unmet emotional needs and unconscious trauma... isolation and loneliness.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, it really has to be dealt with at the emotional under layers of what made these people so ripe for radicalization and weaponization by a demagogue and ego-maniac like Trump.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, cults prey on the psychologically vulnerable, exactly as Trump did.
</p>

<p>
	But it was greatly exacerbated by the new technologies of the 21th century.
</p>

<p>
	Really, all this Trumpism and anti-vax stuff just boils down to humans learning how to balance out the new power afforded to them by the internet. When under-educated humans are allowed to create their own epistemic echo-chambers via social media in a capitalist system -- shit hits the fan. It's the same problem as allowing dumb people to mess around with their own DNA. Imagine if your average FoxNews viewer got a hold of DNA-changing technology like CRISPR? Imagine what kind of monstrosities they would create.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that epistemology is such an abstract and intangible thing that almost nobody takes it seriously. At least with DNA modification it's tangible and easy to regulate and see its dangers. But no politician or TV pundit sees the very real dangerous of modifying one's epistemology.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this:
</p>

<p>
	If you discovered your teenage son tinkering with his DNA or plutonium, you would freak out and stop him immediately. But what do you do when your teenage son is tinkering with his epistemology on his iPad???
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate problem is how do we deprogram all these MAGA members after Trump exits?
</p>

<p>
	It's the same problem as cult deprogramming.
</p>

<p>
	This is an epistemology problem. The right-wing has created such as deep and profitable ideological echo-chamber that I don't even know where to begin healing it.
</p>

<p>
	We see this with Pizzagate, anti-vaxxers, Flatearthers, etc. Go try healing one of these people. It's impossible. They got cancer of the mind. And not just one but a cluster of them.
</p>

<p>
	There is a very anti-mainstream mood in the air. But what these anti-mainstreamers don't realize is that being anti-mainstream can be WORSE and lower in consciousness than the mainstream! Which is why we have the word "cult". A "cult" is just a toxic splinter cell within mainstream cult-ure.
</p>

<p>
	The only difference between culture and a cult is that culture is proven by natural selection to scale and be sustainable whereas a cult is not.
</p>

<p>
	Culture is a cult which has proven itself sustainable and healthy over the centuries when others did not pass the natural selection tests. MAGA will obviously not pass the natural selection test. It is no scalable or sustainable.
</p>

<p>
	Absolutely!
</p>

<p>
	The last 4 years have created a right-wing MAGA echo-chamber of epic proportions which has rotted the minds of at least 40% of Americans.
</p>

<p>
	This is the real problem. And this problem will not end with Trump's exit. The real problem is confirmation bias thanks to social media of unprecedented scales. People are literally using social media to cherrypick and construct fantastical views of reality, and no one can stop them. Ironically this is a consequence of an increase in democracy.
</p>

<p>
	The democratisation of epistemology is a very dangerous thing when people have no clue what epistemology is. I explain all this in my video: Understanding Democracy:

	It's not just the physical guns. It's the culture and the level of inequality.

<p>
	In Finland those are mostly probably hunting rifles -- also a part of Finish culture.

<p>
	It's just basic psychology of the ego. Nothing mysterious about it. The ego is very predictable in its tricks once you study the  ego deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	When you fully understand the ego-mind, people's behaviors become so predictable. People are like robots that way. Because they are just acting out cravings and fears. Nothing more. A person driven by craving and fear is very predictable. Truly original behavior requires Tier 2 cognitive development. The lower you are on the Spiral the more predictable your behavior is. Like an animal.
</p>

<p>
	Once you become ridiculously conscious your behavior becomes impossible to predict because you're so free, flexible, and creative. Your mind has been jailbroken.
</p>

<p>
	No. It's imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Your physical body is actually just a dense form of imagination. Note: I'm not saying that your idea of having a body is imaginary. I am saying your actual body is imaginary. If you look at your hand long enough you will realize it is imaginary.

</p>

<p>
	You have a body in the sense that you are imagining it right now. But you can also stop imagining it -- at which point it will disappear. Of course the ego does not have voluntary control over how the body is imagined. So you cannot just imagine yourself with 5 nipples and it happens. No. Ego doesn't not control that. God is imagining that you have 2 nipples.

	Good for him. Most Republicans should come to their senses. They kept underestimating Trump's depravity for 4 years. Now they can deny it no longer.

<p>
	Honestly, that split already happened 4 years ago with intelligent conservatives like David Frum, Bill Krystal, Nichol Wallace, Joe Scarborough. They knew right off the bat that Trump was an imposter conservative and they opposed him early on.
</p>

<p>
	But now that time has come for the rest of the conservative base who were not so bright and prescient. Now they must choose between MAGA and democracy.

<p>
	Anyone posting news or information in this thread, be very careful that you are not spreading propaganda or falsehoods.
</p>

<p>
	Triple-check your sources before you post here. Don't post random gossip from social media. I am not going to be babysitting you guys through this. If you cannot demonstrate an ability to check facts and sources yet you post it here like it's news but it turns out to be fake, that will get you banned.
</p>

<p>
	Don't share random crap from Facebook or Twitter. Fact-check it first.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives are gonna fracture now between those who have integrity and those who do not. Those with integrity will stand against Trump. Those without it -- the MAGA crowd -- will go all-in on MAGA since they have cancer of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Historically this will be remembered analogous to those who stood against Hitler during his rise and those who denounced him as the devil that he is. Now the line will get very stark.

<p>
	Why are you listening to such right-wingers who have clearly demonstrated themselves to spread falsehoods and propaganda?
</p>

<p>
	Do not post random right-wing gossip here.

<p>
	Otherwise I could post, I've been hearing from some right-wingers that you are a pedophile.
</p>

<p>
	When you try to cast this obviously MAGA movement as somehow caused by communists and Antifa, you instantly discredit yourself. Communists are not contesting the democratic process here, MAGA are. And MAGA will try to blame anyone but themselves for their despicable behavior.

<p>
	You can have conservative views but be sure to distinguish yourself from the kind of partisan ideology found on FoxNews, OANN, NewsMax, etc. Demonstrate that you are not dogmatic or ideological. And don't gaslight us with projection and whataboutism.

<p>
	I would LOVE to see some non-ideological, non-partisan, sane, reasonable fact-based conservatives. They are a rare breed these days.

	Mind what you post. If I catch anyone doing apologetics for Trumpism -- doing stuff like false equivalence between left and right, gaslighting about liberals, or suggesting the election was fraudulent -- you will be banned.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	It's crazy how razor thin US elections are. Especially when the Republicans keep putting up monsters as their candidates.
</p>

<p>
	The saddest thing of all is that these elections should be a slam dunk for Dems.
</p>

<p>
	Which is the clearest proof that people like Ken Wilber and Don Beck are wrong. America is nowhere close to solid Green yet, let alone Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	The rural parts of the country are shockingly regressive. The real question no one is asking is: as cities develop, how do we help rural folks evolve? If we leave the rural folks behind it will come back to bite us, as we see with Trumpism. Trumpism is a rural phenomenon.

<p>
	Not so.
</p>

<p>
	Even a headshot is survivable. And police almost never do headshots. Headshots work in video games but professionals rarely aim for the head since it's so hard to hit.

<p>
	Most people won't even die from a single gunshot. It's actually pretty hard to kill someone. You'd be surprised.
</p>

<p>
	People can get shot 4-6 times and still live.

<p>
	In a sense I don't struggle with friends because I'm so introverted I don't keep them.
</p>

<p>
	I enjoy my own company more than that of any other human. Many people don't understand such a lifestyle.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The struggle was three-fold:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Simply learning to be social at all
	</li>
	<li>
		Getting over my insecurities and limiting beliefs that any hot girl would want to date me
	</li>
	<li>
		Learning how to flirt and attract women
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	When I started I had big problems with all three.

			I don't think it's really comparable to being short or even a disadvantage for most guys. A well kept shaved head (no grandpa hair on the side with a bald top) is a hairstyle and looks really good on most men and is considered a masculine style. Also facial hair plays a role as well. It really isn't comparable at all to being a short guy.

	When you are a movie star or musician you can literally be a dwarf and you will still get mad pussy.
</p>

<p>
	Need I mention Tom Cruise or Peter Dinklage?
</p>

<p>
	I didn't say you can't get hot girls being bald. You can and I have. But it's still a disadvantage compared to otherwise. When I attract a hot girl I don't do with my looks or money or status. I do it with the inner and outer game I've developed.
</p>

<p>
	You can find plenty of examples of short guys dating super-model girls who are taller than them. Your mind just ignores those counter-examples because it doesn't fit your shit inner game victim mindset. Again... your mind doesn't care about truth here, all it's interested in is rationalizing your victim complex.
</p>

<p>
	Be ware of how your mind plays tricks on you. That's insecurity in a nutshell.

	That's your absurd idea of me. You might as well have photoshopped my face onto Arnold Schwarzeneggar's body. That's what you've done in your mind because you idolize me.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is that I have been insecure my whole life, I've struggle enormously with being social and attracting women.
</p>

<p>
	When I attract a hot woman, she has no idea who I am or how much I make.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I'm 6'2". But... I don't have a square jaw. I'm not classically good-looking. I'm skinny. No girl gives a fuck about my spirituality, knowledge, or wisdom. She has no idea how much money I make and I never tell her. I can be socially awkward. I'm highly introverted and don't like small-talk.
</p>

<p>
	1000s of hours of work went into making me dating-material. And much of it was invested into improving my inner game.

You must go and test it in the field. Go attract 100 girls and see how it works. Until then you won't understand it.

<p>
	Not true.
</p>

<p>
	You can be a farmer while conscious that your farm and the people it feeds are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You can dream consciously. That's the point of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with dreaming. The only problem is when you get so lost in your dreams you forget they are dreams.

<p>
	Happiness is consciousness-contextual.
</p>

<p>
	You can only be unconditionally happy if your consciousness is advanced enough to allow it. Otherwise you will have various conditions, and your conditions will depends on your consciousness. If you are stuck in material consciousness then your conditions for happiness will be material.
</p>

<p>
	Again, since you are God, you are imaging/creating the conditions of your own happiness -- but you're not conscious enough to know how you're doing it.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you say: "I can't be happy without X" -- then you cannot be happy without it.

	The mind cannot just surrender the operating system it was programmed with any more than your computer can. This would require a painful and long jailbreaking of one's mind, which virtually no one is prepared to pursue.

	Yes, it does. Since things only exist when you imagine they do. And you will stop imagining the outer world at some point.

<p>
	Because reality is imaginary. If you aren't conscious of this, you will buy into whatever reality your culture pushed you to imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Every Christian has been indoctrinated into Christianity. No exceptions. Where else would such ideas come from? They can only ever be fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Since your mind constructs reality, whatever you buy into deeply enough will become your reality because you are God.

<p>
	Better than a .45 bullet in your face.
</p>

<p>
	I think you under-estimate how serious a brawl with the police is. If a cop is pulling his taser on you, something is already seriously wrong. In which case you should be glad he's not pulling a .45 or a baton.
</p>

<p>
	Policing is dirty work. How do you think a baton to your skull feels?

<p>
	I mean the big picture.
</p>

<p>
	In the big picture Trump's ugliness cost Republicans the entire 2020 election. Which is exactly how it should be. Razor thin, but authoritarian has been rejected by most Americans.
</p>

<p>
	Idiocy and selfishness should be punished at the ballet box. Because in the end idiocy and selfishness lead to bad governance -- and people don't like that.
</p>

<p>
	Looks like Georgia is so thin it's within recount territory. So I'm still skeptical if Dems truely have the senate. Mitch McConnel has got to go. The man is a beast.

			Is it though? Trump gained an additional 7 million votes despite running arguably the most incompetent and corrupt administration in all of US History. That's in addition to the hundreds of thousands of deaths directly caused by his criminally negligence in the midst of a pandemic.
		</p>

		<p>
			A 50/50 Split in the Senate still leaves a Biden administration with dismal prospects of getting any significant legislation passed, due to Republicans being able to use the filibuster to smother any meaningful legislation in the cradle.

		<p>
			That's to take nothing away from the people of Georgia though, and to the grassroots organizers who busted thier ass to get out the vote and flip the state Blue.

	This is true of all insecurities, ever.
</p>

<p>
	No one is sayimg there aren't downsides to certain ways of being born. The downsides can be real. The trick is being strong enough to overcome it and not let it get you down.
</p>

<p>
	You think being bald is not a consistent downside in dating? It's like having one hand tied behind your back in a boxing match.
</p>

<p>
	But you must play the cards you've been dealt.

<p>
	The only reason an animal's survival seems graceful is because you are so far detached from it that if doesn't personally affect your emotional system.
</p>

<p>
	Animals are brutal and evil as fuck. If the things that animals did to each other happened to your children, you'd be on CNN screaming. Which is why humans invented government.

<p>
	Obviously traditional vaccines do contain mercury and in a mercury detox book you will be told to avoid them.
</p>

<p>
	But...
</p>

<p>
	A) Covid is a novel virus with novel risks that must be weight against the risk of mercury.
</p>

<p>
	B) Covid vaccines are novel, with what seems like no mercury.
</p>

<p>
	C) Once you have mastered the detox protocol, a bit of mercury will not kill you. You can just detox it away. You get mercury in your food and water every day no matter what.
</p>

<p>
	D) There is a big difference between getting dozens of shots when you're a developing baby vs getting 2 shots as a mature adult.
</p>

<p>
	- - - -
</p>

<p>
	The problem is not so much mercury as it is that you've never detoxed it in your life. Once you have a detox method, then you don't have to worry about it building up. It's like changing the oil in your car. If you never change it, that's a problem. If you change it regularly, a bit of dirt in your fuel is not a problem.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine not changing your oil for 30 years?

<p>
	There are MANY other things which could cause brain fog and poor brain performance. So don't be so simple-minded. If detox doesn't work, there are still plenty of other things you can try.
</p>

<p>
	I highly doubt that your situation is due to bad genetics. Mostly likely it's due to poor diet and other things you can correct.

<p>
	Is someone forcing you to kiss fat girls?
</p>

<p>
	You can be unattracted to a thing without being an obnoxious insensitive ass about it.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, it doesn't matter what a feminist or whoever says, her attraction will still be highly selective, self-serving, and biologically based. Don't listen to what a girl says she's attracted to, look at what she's actually attracted to. Look at what makes her open her legs. That's the truth.

<p>
	I see very little difference between TYT and Kyle. Their worldviews are almost identical. The differences are stylistic not substantive. They all rail against mainstream media as if it were the devil when in fact CNN reports news better and more objectively than any progressive YTer.
</p>

<p>
	Progressive YTers have better political analysis than CNN. But CNN still does better news reporting.

<p>
	There's not really a how.
</p>

<p>
	You will either have an awakening to Love or not. Psychedelics help.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different kinds of awakenings.

</p>

<p>
	Did Trunp use shady and illegal tactics to win in 2016? Of course! His lawyer admitted it. Trump broke the law with his hush payments.
</p>

<p>
	As for Russia, they were clearly on Trump's side with hacking and propaganda campaigns. And Trump cheated again in the 2020 election using Ukraine.

	They are like broken records. I don't even need to listen to them any more to know what they are going to say.

<p>
	In practice, statistically speaking, yes.
</p>

<p>
	But any individual can make an effort to outgrow a dogmatic worldview.
</p>

<p>
	You have to distinguish between what's possible at the individual level vs the collective level. For example, not everyone in the world can become a millionaire, but you can.
</p>

<p>
	There are millions of ex-ideological people who outgrew it.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so simple.
</p>

<p>
	The creative aspirations of ambitious people are what leads, employs, feeds, and aids thousands of others.
</p>

<p>
	Progressive projects require lots of capital and vision.

<p>
	A bit, but nobody is going to give you a marketing plan. You have to create that yourself.
</p>

<p>
	A coaching program is not going to give you a coaching biz. It will teach you how to coach, but the biz you must create yourself. No one will ever create a biz for you, not even any biz program.
</p>

<p>
	IPEC does give lots of tips and ideas on marketing.
</p>

<p>
	But keep in mind, most people who complete the program never actually become well-paid coaches. Because most people don't understand how to run a business.
