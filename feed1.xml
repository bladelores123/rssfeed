</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like if I told you that you just won a lottery for an infinite number of dollars and you replied back to me, "Great, but how do I become even more rich?"

	Infinity has no inside or outside. It goes on forever in infinite dimensions, in infinite directions.
</p>

<p>
	This is not only beyond language, it is beyond your ability to think or picture in any way whatsoever.

<p>
	Raising conscious is a broad, general solution. But there is still the issue of:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		How to raise consciousness within a particular domain. There are thousands of domains to develop consciousness in.
	</li>
	<li>
		If you have creative goals, you will need lots of technical how-to information for how to get stuff done (which is independent of consciousness). For example, no amount of consciousness will teach you how to play the piano, solve a calculus problem, or how to speak effectively.
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	When I say something like "All of life boils down to raising consciousness" this is a deliberately over-simplified rule of thumb to make a point. Don't take it too literally.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	That's where you went wrong.
</p>

<p>
	All THINKING is self-deception. The mistake you are making is trusting your own rationality.
</p>

<p>
	If humans are as SUPER susceptible to hallucination and wishful beliefs as you claim, then by your own logic YOU (as a human) are currently hallucinating, and all of your rationality and justification and "critical thinking" is also hallucination precisely because you fear death.
</p>

<p>
	So you're half-right. The mistake you're making is that you're not applying your own skepticism to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Classic stage Orange.
</p>

<p>
	You are barking up a tree the depth of which you haven't even begin to fathom at your stage of development.
</p>

<p>
	Thousands of years of indoctrination is why you are rejecting the things I am telling you.
</p>

<p>
	Supernatural views exist because paranormal phenomena are easily experienced by millions of people all around world, and have been for all of human history, including today. This doesn't make sense to you because your consciousness and experience is so limited, and you're a dogmatic materialist. Of course you tell yourself you're openminded, but that's just your ego playing a trick on you. You are not openminded. You're not conscious of your closedmindedness yet.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that what we're talking about here are EXTREMELY advanced insights which are outside the realm of your current understanding, or society's understanding. Your standard rationalist and skeptic lines of argumentation are not going to cut it here. I've heard them all. There is no rationalist or materialist objection you can raise which I have not heard a hundred times before. What we are talking about is way beyond all that.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like you're trying to teach 8th grade algebra to people discussing post-graduate calculus. We already know your algebra backwards and forwards. We are interested in something orders of magnitude more advanced.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	See my video about that.
</p>

<p>
	That's all that's going on here.
</p>

<p>
	What's required of you if you wish to develop further is radical openmindedness and serious research.
</p>

<p>
	You need to have a genuine desire to question your own worldview.
</p>

<p>
	The issue here is no religion vs science, the issue is questioned metaphysical and epistemic assumptions which both religion and science hold dogmatically and refuse to question.
</p>

<p>
	The distinction you've drawn between religion and science is a myth which you unquestioningly absorbed from culture.
</p>

<p>
	What we're pointing you to here is not religion or science, but something far beyond both.

<title>How to build Discipline</title>

<p>
	There is no solution to discipline other than discipline.
</p>

<p>
	You must set a clear goal and then work towards it every day, building momentum over time. For this, vision is very important.
</p>

<p>
	But in the end, you must....
</p>

<p>
	JUST DO IT!
</p>

<p>
	Start small and ramp your way up over the weeks, months, and years. If it was easy, everyone would be mega-successful. No one else can do it for you and there are no shortcuts or magic pills. You gotta have the courage to bite the bullet and endure some emotional labor and discomfort.
</p>

<p>
	The key is consistency. You must chip away at it every day and not bite off more than you can chew.
</p>

<p>
	Teaching enlightenment is actually the easiest gig in the world. Any fool can do it.
</p>

<p>
	Here's the formula:
</p>

<p>
	Step #1: What are you?
</p>

<p>
	Step #2: Whatever object you find that you think you are, you're wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Step #3: Repeat steps #1 and #2 until enlightenment happens.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, we could program a 1980's computer to teach people enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Or just go do some 5-MeO-DMT and you'll instantly understand what enlightenment is.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The solution to emotions is not avoidance, but full embrace, acceptance, and consciousness of them.
</p>

<p>
	Most people who act out emotions like fear, anger, sadness, etc. are not really being emotional, they are doing the opposite: avoiding emotions.

Your first dose should have been 1g.
</p>

<p>
	What happened was, the mushrooms were showing you nonduality but it is far too radical for you to accept upon first contact. The Truth is too overwhelming and the ego recoils in horror. The mind gets lost inside itself -- this produces the sense of insanity and hell.
</p>

<p>
	As you develop and become more conscious, and as you trip more, you become better able to surrender to Truth without struggling with it, and the trips becomes deeply enjoyable and profound beyond anything you can imagine. The more conscious you are, the more you meditate, the better you are able to control your mind during the trip. People with no meditation experience and monkey mind will get lost inside their own minds on mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Your mistake was starting with such a high dose.
</p>

<p>
	Dozens of trips are required to slowly get a feel for how to surf in the psychedelic headspace. Every trip builds on the previous. No two trips are the same. With each trip you figure out a bit of the puzzle.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms are one of the most challenging psychedelics at higher doses. They can get really twisted and they can easily butt rape you. Especially if you're egotistical and cocky.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get scared off. Just get more serious and lower your dose to something you can handle.
</p>

<p>
	Getting humbled by a psychedelic is a very good lesson. It lays the foundation for all future psychedelic work.
</p>

<p>
	Emotions are tools your mind uses to maintain itself. There is no such thing as a useless emotion. Every emotion is there keep you being you.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to change, however, (that is, you want to be a new you), then learning to master your emotions is the #1 skill for that. By changing your emotions you change who you are.
</p>

<p>
	How you emote is who you are. Emotions are to a human being what flight controls are to an airplane.

<p>
	Count how many times you wrote "me", "my", "I" in your post.
</p>

<p>
	That's why.
</p>

<p>
	You keep thinking you into existence. Stop thinking about yourself and you will cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	"You" can't get enlightened. Enlightenment is the end of you-ing.
</p>

<p>
	This problem requires extreme mindfulness. Watch for I-thoughts like a hawk and deconstruct them or let them go.
</p>

<p>
	It needs to become clear that the self is a conceptual fabrication, not a physical object. And this needs to be seen deeper than at the level of thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
	Survival has always been, and will always be, a brutal endeavor.
</p>

<p>
	People are selfish for a reason: because it's essential to survival.
</p>

<p>
	Even the most enlightened master still has to contend with survival demands if he cares to live.
</p>

<p>
	It's very useful to adopt the following attitude: no one is ever going to solve any problem for you in life. It's all up to you. If you cannot solve a problem yourself, expect it to go unsolved. This is the principle of extreme responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	This is not exclusive to Green. People are generally lazy across the board, people love to play victim across the board, and people have no sense of direction across the board.
</p>

<p>
	Of course! All of this is just the complacency of mainstream society, and these days people are so spoiled with video games and easy childhood that they have zero work ethic or self-determination.
</p>

<p>
	This is why self-help exists.
</p>

<p>
	JP is himself stuck in victim thinking and so are all his followers.
</p>

<p>
	This is just what ego does. It never wants to take responsibility. Especially not for emotional or mental issues.

<p>
	Well, people are still fundamentally self-centered at any stage. Don't expect them to work for you for free for 4 months.
</p>

<p>
	No one stranger or even friend is gonna take care of you. Maybe family will, if they are really generous. But even with family there will be limits. People have their own problems to handle.
</p>

<p>
	Didn't you have crutches or a wheelchair to move around?

<p>
	5-MeO is definitely effective for addiction treatment. This has been demonstrated over and over again by folks like Octavio Rettig.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it is also an effective anti-depressant. And safer than ketamine.

</p>

<p>
	Each trip builds on the previous.
</p>

<p>
	Dosage is not the most important factor.
</p>

<p>
	To get the deepest insights you need to hone a strong intent and practice contemplation seriously.
</p>

<p>
	And if that fails, vaporization should do the trick. It will hit hard and fast, so start low.

</p>

<p>
	That is also known as Sahaja Samadhi.
</p>

<p>
	That is our ultimate goal.
</p>

<p>
	But still, do not forget about development. You can be in Sahaja Samadhi but still be at a low stage of Spiral development.

	Psychedelics are a power tool. They must be used very carefully, wisely, and responsibly. They are no toy.

<p>
	Do not give psychedelics a bad name through juvenile usage. The psychedelic gods will punish you, and oh will you suffer.

	For a newbie, it can be a good gateway. A newbie is not gonna appreciate underground Turquoise teachings. Those come later.

<p>
	Surrender your whole life to the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Don't ask why or how.
</p>

<p>
	Just do it.
</p>

<p>
	You are not important. Your needs are not important. Let it all go.
</p>

<p>
	Once everything is let go, there are no more problems.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Don't tarnish the Buddha's name to justify your closedmindedness.
</p>

<p>
	You are being shown extremely advanced and cutting-edge techniques here.
</p>

<p>
	If the Buddha told you about enlightenment 2500 years ago, a closedminded person like yourself would have burned him at the stake for witchcraft. Which is exactly what people like you did to Jesus. The only reason you know of Jesus today is because people like you killed him 2000 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	Think about it.

	All knowledge in the relative domain is probablisitic and fallible.
</p>

<p>
	It is not about being sure, it is about taking the best seeming course despite incomplete information.
</p>

<p>
	Get used to taking action on incomplete information. If new, better information surfaces you can adjust course.

		<p>
			Not quite. The (paraphrased) instruction is "write something you know to be true, or believe to be true, and keep reducing it until you reach what <em>is </em>true". So knowing that you don't know <i>for sure</i> that something you know in everyday terms is 'true' (I.e. Earth being round) is very much a part of that reduction process. Now take it further: reduce the various reasons, ways, evidences etc. that we've brought up in this thread and reduce them down to what they truly seem to be. Then take that and reduce it down. 
		</p>

		<p>
			By reducing, we recognise and understand what is not absolutely truthful in our understanding; thought-images, conceptual models, emotional beliefs of ourselves and the world - we take all these things and attempt to identify what is <em>untrue </em>about them. When something is identified as untrue, it can be put down. Eventually, maybe we put everything untrue down. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So it's not about figuring out what you are, it's putting down what you're not. And I think one of the biggest risks is <em>believing what anybody else says you 'truly' are. </em>Because your head-canon of what they mean becomes a new thing you carry around, a new untruth. Many people seem to be trying to figure out how they can prove to themselves they are infinite consciousness or whatever. Don't. Won't work, can't win. Just find what is untrue in every word, thought, deed, and belief, and put them down

<p>
	Good
</p>

<p>
	But there is nothing which is not God. To be infinite means to be everything. So your body is God.
</p>

<p>
	Next time, try contemplating without doing the writing thing. Let go of everything and take a full dive into the mushroom headspace. Writing is holding you back. The deepest insights are non-verbal.

<p>
	As organic, raw, fresh, whole, unprocessed food as possible is best.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of fruits and veggies is best.
</p>

<p>
	High quality meat is good too.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like it is not as pure, requiring higher dose.
</p>

<p>
	Nasal snorting is tricky. Easy to lose half the dose down your throat.
</p>

<p>
	Rectal plugging is a more reliable way to get the full dose.
</p>

<p>
	You may have a naturally high tolerance. No psychedelic works the same on everyone at the same dosage.
</p>

<p>
	Try plugging 20mg, then increase to 25mg, then 30mg, and so on until you get a breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	Vaporizing should easily give a breakthrough. Careful. Start with very low dose like 5mg and work up.
</p>

Psychedelics can reveal the Absolute and many other valid insights.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are not the opposite of enlightenment. You have to distinguish between genuine insight and visual phenomena. All visual phenomena is relative. Genuine insight is genuine insight.

None of us actually have any direct experience of it.
</p>

<p>
	For autolysis purposes, you admit that it is a belief, that you don't know, and that even if it were true, it would be a relative truth.
</p>

<p>
	With autolysis you are looking for Absolute Truth. Which means if it was not present before the Big Bang, it is false.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth can only be found in your direct experience. It is what you are. It is the feeling of reality itself.

<p>
	Hehehe....
</p>

<p>
	You're misunderstanding how this works.
</p>

<p>
	You can enjoy whatever you want. It's just that conscious people enjoy healthy things while unconscious people force themselves to do healthy things out of obligation.
</p>

<p>
	For the conscious person, the healthy action and the enjoyable action are one and the same.
</p>

<p>
	Things are only a problem if your mind makes them a problem.

<p>
	These days not so much. Usually I just feel bad from the food itself more so than from my own sense of guilt.
</p>

<p>
	I've realized long ago that guilting myself for stuff like that is counterproductive.
</p>

<p>
	The bad food itself is enough get me to correct course.

	You must awaken. Then it will make sense. Until then, not a chance.

<p>
	Awakening is unlike anything you could ever imagine.

<p>
	There are no fractals unless your are tripping balls.
</p>

<p>
	Samadhi is identical to whatever you're seeing right now. Same stuff is seen, just under a different context.
</p>

<p>
	Samadhi is ALWAYS the case. There can't not be samadhi. The only problem is that your mind is giving your present experience a false dualistic context which makes you unaware of the ever-present samadhi.
</p>

<p>
	Look at your hand for a long time without any thoughts. That is basically samadhi.
</p>

<title>Is &quot;Letting Go&quot; something you do or something that happens when you become aware?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/25999-is-letting-go-something-you-do-or-something-that-happens-when-you-become-aware/?do=findComment&amp;comment=293490</link>

<p>
	It is something you do.
</p>

<p>
	Try it right now: just let go of the tension in your right hand.
</p>

<p>
	Notice you can do it.
</p>

<p>
	Stop overthinking it.
</p>

<p>
	With psychological issues, you cannot let go of a thing you are not aware of. So in that case you must become aware of it first, then let it go.
</p>

<p>
	Letting go of psychological issues requires repeated letting go. Once does not work.
</p>

			I haven't tried 5-MeO yet, but I had an experience on DPT of what I would call complete ego death, beyond senses, time and space, the most humbling experience I've ever had. The moment after I came back it felt extremely true. Until I will try 5-MeO, I can't claim it was the same. Reaching absolute infinity through meditation and confirming or denying whether it's the same or different from 5-MeO, this curiosity is something that has motivated me for the last year to do very heavy Samatha practice and I'm not that far away from equanimity stage where I will be able to access it, I think 3 months left max.

<p>
	Of course is does! Buddhism can get very dogmatic and religious. Which is why we're having this conversation.
</p>

<p>
	It's dangerous to assume that Buddhism is somehow pure and immune from dogma or corruption.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, I would venture a bet that the majority of Buddhists are dogmatic and corrupt.
</p>

<p>
	No one and no thing in this work can be trusted. All authority is delusion. Direct experience is the only source of Truth.

			the mind makes things exclusionary and dogmatic. The teaching points to the truth, you know this already so I don’t know why your framing in this sense.

<p>
	That's overly simplistic and naive.
</p>

<p>
	Not all teachings are the same. Not all pointers are the same.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the mind can corrupt even the bestest of teachings, but many teachings are already fundamentally corrupt and dogmatic to begin with, and do not encourage integral thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Integral teachings are rare.

<p>
	Because after enlightenment, you are gone, dead. You surrendered your entire life.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard for a dead man to suffer since suffering is the avoidance of death.

<p>
	Once you are infinite, nothing can harm you. The body can die and it does not bother you.

<p>
	There is a lot of wisdom within Buddhism. The problem though is turning it into a dogma or believing it without direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	No teacher, no teaching can be trusted in this work. Because you do not know what is true or who is true.
</p>

<p>
	You must independently verify every teaching and cross-reference it against other sources.
</p>

<p>
	There are also many different kinds of Buddhism, so how do you know which one to follow, which one is true? You don't and can't without independent verification
</p>

<p>
	I have read it. Just at a high level.
</p>

<p>
	My mind grasps things holistically. It does not need to go through logical steps or formal proofs.
</p>

<p>
	I had understood the essence of Godel's discovery before I even knew Godel existed. Epistemically, the map can never be the territory. Truth cannot be symbolized. It is really obvious that no formal logical system could ever encapsulate the Truth due to the problem of self-reference. Godel intuited this too. Then he formally proved it. Godel intuited the truth of his proof before he created the proof.

	I dislike linear logical thinking.
</p>

<p>
	I find it very boring.
</p>

<p>
	I underatand Godel's theorem on a high, metaphysical level. I don't bother with the details of it. The details of things are rarely important to me. All I really care about is the big picture.

			How do mental illnesses fit into this model? For example psychopathy, as it does not seem to relate to universal care and if it's not possible to heal this "illness" one cannot evolve further? Or is psychopathy just an extreme case of a certain emotional underdevelopment?

<p>
	Mental illness can happen at any stage. But more common at lower stages simply because it's hard to get to a high stage with an unresolved mental illness.
</p>

<p>
	Most mental illness can be healed. It usually requires doing the right inner work which people are not taught how to do.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really make sense to me how a mental illness will survive deep consciousness work unless you got some physical brain injury.
