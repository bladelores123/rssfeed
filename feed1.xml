<p>
	Yes, that's is the myopia of your current level of development. As you develop higher you will reach a point where you will realize the deep interconnectedness of yourself and your community. And then such a dualistic attitude as you now hold will become untenable.
</p>

<p>
	There is still a fundamental selfishness to your position.
</p>

<p>
	To neglect your community is to neglect yourself, since you and other are one.
</p>

<p>
	But do as you like. I am not judging you, just making a prediction about where you growth can take you.
</p>

<p>
	I see that many of you folks here need a serious education in the connection between spirituality and politics. Spiritual work alone is not enough to make one politically wise. Especially not with the traditional non-integral spiritual schools like Zen, Vedanta, etc. This is a major spiritual pathology: neglecting ecological concerns for personal salvation. It's about as selfish as eating all the food on the life-raft while others are looking the other way.
</p>

The only question is whether you are creating consciously or unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
	To refuse the call of taking ownership of your godly creative capacity is a creation you create. If you choose to sit in your Mom's basement your whole life eating Cheetos and jerking off to anime, that's what you as God created. But you did so not aware that you could have created something else. And so in effect you created a devil of yourself.
</p>

He has no principles or political ideas. All he cares about is narcissism and personal success and glory.
</p>

<p>
	He would call himself a communist if that allowed him to advance his narcissistic agenda. You misunderstand his motives. In his mind whatever gets him the most power, money, fame, and sex is what's considered true and valid.

<p>
	Raise your level of consciousness and the whole situation will look very differently.
</p>

<p>
	Trump will not pull off a North Korea deal. He does not know how to make deals.

<p>
	There is one thing which is impossible: for God not to be God.
</p>

<p>
	Or, put another way: it is impossible for everything not to be as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to frame it is: possible/impossible is a duality which collapses into unity at the level of the Absolute. So actually it's impossible to distinguish between possible/impossible. Until you do. Until you don't.
</p>

<p>
	No. People will vote however they want. But if people were more engaged in the process, more knowledgeable, more conscious, they would elect more conscious and humane leaders.
</p>

<p>
	The quality of our leaders directly reflect the quality of the voters.
</p>

<p>
	If you follow Actualized.org and you don't vote, that's one conscious person surrendering his responsibility to devils.
</p>

<p>
	The key here is that you must take responsibility for being a member of society. Stop thinking of yourself as merely an individual. You are NOT merely that. Wake up to the fact that you are part of a community. In a conscious community members act for the good of each other.
</p>

<p>
	I will talk more about that soon.
</p>

<p>
	But in a nutshell, your work is be a Creator, embody the Goodness, Love, and Wisdom of God in your life. To truly be God is to live a God-like life. It's not enough to realize God and then go back to working at Starbucks. Your vision of your life must match that which a God would create. Would a God sit around while the Earth was raped and pillaged by devils? Guess again.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you don't have to. But if you fully understood your power, you probably wouldn't squander your life as you now do.
</p>

<p>
	See, right now you are not a conscious creator. But God is a conscious creator. You must take ownership of your creative capacity. Which is a distinct thing from enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	As the saying goes: You work towards "A more perfect union"
</p>

<p>
	Today conscious creators are more needed than ever before in human history. Or civilization will collapse.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Be careful with your false equivalencies. There is no equivalence between the Democrats and Republicans right now.
</p>

<p>
	And voting in primaries is even more important than the general election. So your vote DOES matter. US elections hinge on very small margins. Trump won by a hundred thousands votes at most. Gore lost by thousands of votes.
</p>

<p>
	So in America your vote actually counts A LOT. In NY you could vote for better representatives and state legislators. You just have to start treating politics seriously, not the nonsense you see on Youtube of people "owning" each other.
</p>

<p>
	Not voting directly leads to war and other kinds of devilry. As it happening right now. Trump is laying the groundwork for a war with Iran. Which would be catastrophic.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Although that's already been sorta found with 5-MeO-DMT. Not sure what more magic pill you could want.
</p>

<p>
	The obstacle isn't the pill, it's that you don't actually want to awaken. You like stalling and dragging this out. So contrary to what people naively assume, a magic pill for enlightenment will not awaken the world because more importantly the world has to want to awaken. Which it doesn't. So the real work is in getting the world to truly want to awaken.

<p>
	No! Trump is nowhere near Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Trump hasn't read a single book in his life! Lol
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse his BS "deals" for real deals. It's all posturing and fakery. There is no deal with North Korea. North Korea is playing him and they will never denuclearize. The reason Trump gets along well with dictators is because that's the level of consciousness he's at (Red). It's easier for him to get along with Kim or Putin than with a European Green leader.
</p>

<p>
	If Hitler or Stalin were alive, Trump would probably get along well with them.
</p>

<p>
	Stop rationalizing Trump's actions as somehow strategic brilliance or 3-dimensional chess. It's is pure ego and opportunism. Like a hyena. Trump is playing checkers while Kim and Putin are playing 3D chess. The North Koreans are very savvy players. And the Russians even more so.

<p>
	As for what you can do, you can awaken yourself and demonstrate your wokeness through your life. By being a powerful role-model people will naturally gravitate towards you. But you'll have to train yourself to be that way.

<p>
	Openmindness will eventually kill you.
</p>

<p>
	Why else do think most people keep their minds so closed?
</p>

<p>
	Death by truth. Death by truth.

<p>
	That's exactly right, you do need it. God cannot know itself unless it knows suffering. Bliss cannot be known or apprecaited withoutÂ first suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Life would be incomplete without suffering.

</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind there are various degrees of awakening. The initial shallow levels can feel nihilistic. But then you discover God, Infinity, Love, and Goodness as Absolutes and you fall in love with reality. It's truly too good to believe. The goodness is so good you will deny its reality at first.
</p>

<p>
	It's too good for the ego to handle without imploding. Which is why the ego judges it. Love is a threat to your very way of life because you have been living in fear.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is like a rabid dog which bites the hand of the doctor who tries to cure it. That is the divine tragedy.

<p>
	Yes, just think of consciousness at the "stuff" of reality. So replace trillions and trillions of atoms with one field of consciousness. This field is like an LCD screen which can display any image: dog, tree, human, alien, etc. The screen is unlimited in what it can display. God is that entire screen and also all the images it displays. Image and screen are one. Right now you are one image. After this image dies, a new image will appear. And so on forever. So nothing actually dies, it just changes images.

<p>
	The full Truth and nothing but the Truth is hard for a mere moral to accept, especially after a lifetime of lies, self-deception, and dualistic social conditioning.
</p>

<p>
	But it's wonderful once you get past all that.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth only looks upsetting when it's seen from a position of falsehood. Truth stings the devil because it threatens to transform him into God. For a devil not to become God he must deny Truth. So that's what devils are constantly doing. Otherwise they'd be God.

Yopo extraction will yield bufotinine, which is a very different chemical. It's got a very high bodyload.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is a very delicate molecule which gets destroyed via traditional extraction methods. There is also very little of it there in the plant to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	You are better off milking a toad if you want "natural" 5-MeO.

BUT! This doesn't make intellectual contemplation useless. You must start somewhere. You cannot just jump instantly into a profound mystical experience. You must first ask quality questions to prepare your mind. This questioning sets intent and direction. It gets your mind looking in the right direction. It makes you curious. It makes you question and doubt everything you think you know, which then opens up the mind to have a mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	So the two are profoundly connected.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you could just have immediate mystical experiences it would not be sufficient because your mind still has to interpret them properly, make sense of them, speak about them in some coherent way, interconnect various distinct experiences, and figure out how to apply them in a complex social world. Which is why quality thinking is still important, even after awakening. You can't just completely skip over the mind. The mind is still there. It still holds various beliefs and opinions and worldviews. A lot of work goes into purify all that so that your mind becomes ready to do God's work. To skip the mind is to get stuck with the old corrupt mind that you started with.
</p>

It both is and is not self-conscious. Some parts of reality are self-conscious while others are not. A dog is not self-conscious but a Zen master is. The dog does not know it is God, a Zen master does.
</p>

<p>
	The substance of reality is CONSCIOUSNESS, but be careful, as this does not automatically mean that all parts of reality are conscious of themselves. CONSCIOUSNESS is not the same a self-consciousness. Consciousness/God is so powerful it can imagine itself to be a dog, thus forgetting that it is actually God. When that dog dies it will realize that is was God the whole time, merely pretending to be a dog.
</p>

<p>
	At the highest level, God is fully aware of itself as God. But as its various incarnations it can be deluded and unaware. Just as you right now are unaware that you God. You are conscious but not fully Self-conscious. You are playing the role of a dumb human <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> Until you wake up.

</p>

<p>
	A vision for your life will never be found in any external object or event. The vision must come from deep inside your mind/heart.
</p>

<p>
	You can do a bunch of stuff, and that might be good grist for the mill, but eventually you have to sit down and imagineer your highest vision.
</p>

<p>
	Be visionary! Don't discount the power of your mind. Creativity comes from inside you.

</p>

<p>
	Better yet, consider hiring a dating coach or taking a bootcamp. Getting good a dating is extremely hands-on. You cannot learn it as a theory. None of the theory translates into real life. You need massive field experience.
</p>

<p>
	50 parts experience to 1 part theory. Otherwise no results.
</p>

<p>
	For cold approach to work you need to be doing 100s of approaches each month. At least until you develop some skill. Then you can ease up.

<title>Which Life Chapter Phase Are You?</title>

<p>
	I would expect that most people following Actualized.org are in the first two phases, as you're lost and looking for answers and direction. People in the 3rd phase are probably too busy to watch self-help videos.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is a goal when you're on a retreat with the intention of breaking through into deep states of samadhi.
</p>

<p>
	But outside of that life must go on, and in fact you will need advanced types of thinking to act effectively in the world and help the world to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to denigrate the mind. The mind is an important tool. Acting mindlessly will result in foolishness.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is not to identify with your thinking and the conclusions of your thinking. Most people think about stuff and then they turn the end result of that into an identity.
</p>

		<p>
			"My" question is, after an enlightenment experience, is it usual for the ego voice, the linguistic thaught voice to be in your head? Basically, for ego thinking continue? As it's still continuing for "me"Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			And does that mean that this mini enlightenment experience of the ego admiring itself to be a lie and realizing, becoming enlightenment itself and as the true self as enlightenment itself only small parts of a much larger enlightenment journey?Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			At full enlightenment does the ego voice disappear forever? Or does it remain? And how does contemplation/thinking happen without the voice? Does thinking happen at all? Is there still contemplation in the usual way or does the nature of the way contemplation happens change?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That ego voice gets recontextualized as the voice of God.
</p>

<p>
	That's God talking to itself!
</p>

<p>
	The voice does not need to disappear. Thoughts serve a very useful function.
</p>

<p>
	The goal is not to stop thoughts but to realize that thoughts are not your only identity. And to get peace from your thoughts when you desire it. The average person gets carried away by her thoughts, totally lost in them. An awake person still has thoughts but isn't dominated by them.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to demonize thoughts, or judge thoughts as bad. Also be careful not to adopt an anti-intellectual form of spirituality, where advanced forms of thinking about the world are dismissed and denied. For example, systems thinking is still very important for resolving world problems and actualizing God's Goodness. Living in a cave is not a sustainable solution to world problems.
</p>

<p>
	Spirit and intellect must be integrated. Your thought process must become multi-dimensional and suffused with spirit rather than suppressed.
</p>

<p>
	Thoughts are really only a problem when they are egoistical thoughts: thoughts of selfishness, manipulation, fear, judgment, rationalization, criticism, blaming, greed, lying, jealousy, denial, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Purify your thoughts of all that toxic stuff.
</p>

<title>100 mg of bufo alvarius secrtetion. (5-Meo-DMT)</title>

<p>
	100mg is not really enough to work with. That's like equivalent to 1-2 doses, but you will probably waste a few doses just testing and perfecting your vape method.
</p>

<p>
	You'll need more substance to do this properly, with multiple ramped up doses. It would be foolish to vape 100mg straight up. You'll want to build up to that gradually.
</p>

<p>
	It must be vaped.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Enough reading books! You must now actually do the inner work. Books are NOT inner work.
</p>

<p>
	Try some psychedelics and go visit some spiritual communities. There are many spiritual communities around if you just search.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, people get caught in their beliefs. But so do you. You're not out of the woods yet. Now you must move beyond the mind. Now the real work begins.
</p>

<p>
	It is the nature of this work that few people will understand you. But you can make a handful of friends who will be at your level.

So nothing more can be done to help.
</p>

<p>
	When you are ready to admit that everything you've be taught was a lie, then come back and let's talk.
</p>

<p>
	You have no interest in Truth. You are interested in defending your preexisting position. That won't cut it if you want to realize God.

	5-MeO is the most direct path towards God-realization. No other method is as fast or as clinically precise.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's hard to say because there are not just two experiences (psychedelic vs meditative) there are literally hundreds of different mystical experiences, states, insights, and realizations, and with various degrees of depth and breadth.
</p>

<p>
	The mystical terrain is sprawling. No one man has seen it all.
</p>

<p>
	The 5 blind men and the elephant is an important metaphor here.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelic experiences can be weak or deep. Meditative satori can be weak or deep. It all depends on how you're doing it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Synthesizing 5-MeO is very challenging. Some random guy is not going to know how to do it. He will more likely give you some random research chemical.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that there of dozens of analogue or similar substances which are far easier to source, like 5-MeO-MiPT, but are not at all the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	When you are getting 5-MeO-DMT you absolutely must verify the source through reliable user reviews. It must be clear that it's pure 5-MeO-DMT. Only professional high-grade labs make it. You cannot extract it in your basement like DMT.

</p>

<p>
	Like I keep saying, there's many layers toÂ this thing. To realize that you are God is a very distinct realization and it's not the same as realizing Nothingness. Even though God of course is Nothingness. But that's not all there is to God.
</p>

<p>
	There are many distinct realizations to have here. Doubt and dispute me all you like, but I'm telling you how it is.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate: What is God?
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot in this.

	Consciousness is Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	And Nothingness is not other than Form.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to over-emphasize Nothingness to the exclusion of Form. That is only half-enlightenment. You must go full-circle to realize that Form and Formlessness are totally identical. That is the highest realization.

</p>

<p>
	Everything I say you must discover in your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	If you carefully look at what "good" and "bad" are in your direct experience you will notice that they are thoughts of your ego-mind. So you are literally creating them. This is not an opinion or a theory. Look and see how your own mind works.
</p>

<p>
	You must be curious enough to investigate your self's functioning. This is self-science.

	God has infinite free Will. It used itsÂ Will to design a universe in which individual agents like you also have some of it's free will. A human is like a mini-God. The more conscious you are the more free will you have.
</p>

<p>
	I will shoot a video about this soon. It's a bit tricky but also very very important to understand.

If you could do that, you'd already be enlightened. So obviously that cannot work.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is a radical shift in consciousness in which you realize that you were never born and that your whole life was a dream.
</p>

<p>
	You become so conscious that you awaken from life to realize it never happened and that you are actually formless, immortal, and God.
</p>

<p>
	This is outside the realm of any kind of experience you've ever had. It's beyond "experiencing" altogether. It's beyond "life" as you know it. It's a totally new thing. And yet, it's not located anywhere else but right here, right now. Which is what makes it so bafflingly paradoxical.
</p>

<p>
	What you're failing to account for in your reasoning is CONSCIOUSNESS! Your level of consciousness totally determines what you consider real, possible, and impossible. So there's just no way to get to enlightenment from where you presently are. And yet, it can still be done. It requires a radical leap in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	A good way to think of it is that you die and discover what lies on the other side of death. It's not anything you can imagine. It's a lot better than you can imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics make it much easier.
</p>

<title>This Week's Video Failed To Upload</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The video was uploaded but Youtube refused to process it. Stuck at 95%. Which means it cannot be published.
</p>

<p>
	I'm traveling until Tuesday so I can't reupload it until then.
</p>

<p>
	So we'll just have to wait <img alt=":(" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/sad.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/sad@2x.png 2x" title=":(" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Never had this happen before in 5 years. There's probably a bug in the video file itself. Requiring a re-render and a re-upload.
</p>

<p>
	Now you must fend for yourself. May God help you.
</p>

<p>
	JP's worldview and politics are what lead to global warming, unchecked capitalism, the Iraq War, dronestrikes, military industrial complex, Big Pharma, and coups like that currently being staged in Venezuela.
</p>

<p>
	It's basically Bush-era Neo-Con politics. That is right-wing politics which JP is basically defending.

<p>
	The Iraq War killed 200,000+ civilians.

<p>
	Post-modernism doesn't need to be defended. It just needs to understood and integrated.

<p>
	Most people suffer from lack of understanding of relativism. JP is denying the highly important truth of moral relativity. This is an error which will cost many lives.

To know itself fully in all possible ways. To accomplish this God must live through an infinite number of creatures.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot know itself otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	For God to exist, it must be all things. So here you are.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	How could God know what mortality is unless it lived through mortality? To know a thingÂ you must experience it.
</p>

<p>
	That's the genius of the design. You'd have to be crazy selfless to do it. To put yourself into a gas chamber, for example. That's exactly what God does.

<p>
	Can you write up how you make your tea? I thinks folks here might like that.
</p>

<p>
	Start a new thread about it.
</p>

<p>
	And if folks have other methods like alcohol extraction they can share that there as well. I'm curious how to do alcohol extraction. We need a step by step guide.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A) Correct understanding is not limited to experience. Duduction and intuiton are also possible.
</p>

<p>
	B) I have lots of experience with visualization and intention-setting, which is effectively the highest form of prayer.
</p>

<p>
	You might say I use prayer all the time. But it does not look like traditional Christian prayer.
</p>

<p>
	I basically use LoA to attract God to me. Of course I already know I am God, but what this does is make me more God-like, more pure in my thoughts, feelings, and actions.
</p>

<p>
	So this kind of prayer is a great way to deepen one's embodiment post-awakening. It gives you that "Passion of the Christ."
</p>

<p>
	Bro, that's old news. All of that is Trumps lies. It's well documented that Trump inhereted and lost over $400 million.
</p>

<p>
	His net worth numbers are pure lies. Which is why he refuses to release his tax returns. They will show that he loses tons ofÂ money.
</p>

<p>
	What Trump does is get large loans and wastes them while creating a public image of having used them to make money. He manipulates the system to get more and more loans. So he's always playing with other people's money.
</p>

<p>
	It's a classic scam strategy. Which is why every US bank refuses to lend him money. Which is why he had go to Russia for loans. And the Russians are corrupt at fuck. Russia is a mafia state. They use him to launder billions of dollars out of Russia and into real estate.
</p>

<p>
	That's how real business is done son. This is no joke. The Russians don't fuck around. They are stone-cold raqueteers, crafty as the devil. WayÂ craftier than Trump. He is their pawn.

			According to Bible there are some things that happened in the world that didn't even come into God's mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			"And they built the high places of Baal, whichÂ areÂ in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass throughÂ the fireÂ unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin." - Jeremiah 32:35
		</p>

		<p>
			So at least the Bible is teaching clearly that everything that exists is not alwaysÂ God's will or his invention.

<p>
	The Bible is the work of corrupt devils.
</p>

<p>
	Jesus did not write The Bible.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing which is not in God's mind. How can God be unlimited andÂ all-powerful yet overlook some occurance? You make a mockery of God by thinking this way.
</p>

<p>
	EVERYTHING is God's design. Not one hair has been overlooked.
</p>

<p>
	God designed individuals to have a portion of its Will. So that you as an individual may experience what it's like to be a creator. God does not interfer with an individual's exercise of will. That would violate the whole design and purpose of life. God's will is that you act however you will. And so it is. If you will to act like a devil, God will love you no matter what. But other people may hate you. Thus what you call "evil" is pseudo-created. It only exists within people's judgments of you. And your own judgments of you. God does not judge. God is pure Love.
</p>

<p>
	An all-intelligent being will never judge itself. Because judgmentÂ is lack of understanding. To judge is to deny Truth, and God is Truth. Since God is all there is, ifÂ it were to judge anything in existence it would be judging itself, which would be falsehood and delusion.
</p>

<p>
	You would have God be deluded? Haha! No, friend, the delusion is with you.
</p>

<p>
	Judge not lest ye be judged.
</p>

God is bountiful.
</p>

<p>
	The clarity of your connection to God determines your ability to summon help. Most people are very, very disconnected so they get little help. You have to invite God's help, and most devils don't have enough wisdom to do that. They are too busy being devils. A devil will actually refuse God's help.
</p>

<p>
	Devils love to pray. But not listen.

<p>
	That's the kicker! Trump lost $400 million of Daddy's money. Trump is not a billionaire, was never a billionaire, and he does not know how to make money other than by conning you into thinking he's good at making money.
</p>

<p>
	Lol. The whole thing is a con from start to finish. Trump is a loser -- the very thing he hates most to admit. Even when he wins, he loses. Everything he touches gets lost.

	He is a skilled devil, skating on a thin crust of his own bullshit.

	Practically speaking, if you've never had sex, having sex with a few women WILL reduce your neediness. But it will not solve anything fundamental.

<p>
	The devilry of your post is worse than the devilry of your manipulations. Not only did you manipulate the contest, you come here trying to manipulate this spiritual community. But we see right through your bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	Poor devil wants sympathy for this devilry. It's okay devil. God still loves you. Nothing you do will shake God's love for you.
</p>

<p>
	But as for your fellow human devils, they might eat you alive. Devils love to eat their own. Don't expect them to be as kind to you as God. Don't judge them when their hatred rains down on you. That's just your karma being served to you.
</p>

<p>
	You are judging yourself. The God in you sees the devil in you. Which is why you have a guilty conscience.

<p>
	Haha, YES, you're "wrong". All that is judgment and ego.
</p>

<p>
	You think God didn't invent everything you call evil? So you would call God evil?
</p>

<p>
	There is no evil. There is only your judgment. Whatever you believe becomes true, but only for you.
</p>

<p>
	Stop judging God. Stop thinking you know better than God.
</p>

<p>
	The psychopath is the one who judges. You see how you've got everything backwards? The evil you see is the evil your mind creates.
</p>

<p>
	So actually you are being a devil. A devil is one who judges God and calls Goodness evil. That's what you are doing. But of course you are not conscious enough to realize you are doing it. You think you are defending the Good by calling out evil. But that's precisely how you create evil.
</p>

<p>
	You have to realize that morality is a delusion. Nothing is right or wrong. You have complete freedom. But there are natural consequences to all actions -- which also are never right or wrong.
</p>

<p>
	All of this is very tough to swallow for religiously raised folks. What you have to understand is that religion has been corrupted by devilry from the very beginning. So everything you were taught about morality was actually the work of judgmental devils, who succeed in implanting a mind-virus into you which flips all truth upside-down. So actual Truth turns out to be the very opposite of what religion taught you about morality.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	The devil sure is sneaky! He's reading this right now and still he refuses to admit he's a devil. He is totally convinced he's an angel.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Prayers for wanting to merge with God, or wanting to be universally loving, are not delusional. They can be very powerful.
</p>

<p>
	The worst form of prayer is the materialistic and dualistic kind, where you are begging for a father-figure God to give you materialistic stuff. That makes a mockery of prayer.
