	You got it backwards, friend. Evey experience is Absolute Truth.

<p>
	Not true. You are stuck worshiping the idol of formlessness.

	There is a higher awakening which will integrate your formlessness with all form (experience), so that you don't need to minimize any experience.

<p>
	Of course. But what you don't realize is that it would be unGodlike to thrust Infinity on a normie. That is like if God dumped a metric ton of gold coins on a panhandler. It's not as good as you imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Since YOU are God, the problem is not that YOU are the obstacle to your own God-realization. You're preventing it from happening by getting lost in survival and fear and attachment.
</p>

<p>
	You are treating this problem as through it is outside of you. But it's not outside of you. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM! For God to solve your problem he would have to kill you. And you call this evil.
</p>

<p>
	How would you feel if you came to me for enlightenment and I beat you in the head with a baseball bat until your ego was gone. Would you like that? To force awakening on someone who doesn't want it is basically a form of torture.

<p>
	What's so confusing? If a human body can die unconsciously why can't a human body die consciously?
</p>

<p>
	Mahasamadhi makes little sense for a young person who still has a full life ahead of them. But if you're some crusty old 70 year old enlightened master and you got not much else to do, Mahasamadhi may be the perfect exist plan.
</p>

<p>
	(Remember: Mahasamadhi is NOT achieved through physical action but internally.)

<p>
	After all, it's just a belief and a memory at this point.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how you abuse skepticism. You guys are seriously not getting this point.
</p>

<p>
	Selective application of skepticism is abuse of skepticism and you do it without even a second thought.
</p>

<p>
	What if your skepticism is a delusion?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To me the answer is very simple: start your own business and make it successful. By the time you finish that, which should take about 5 years, you should have a solid grasp of Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Of course that is not the only way. But I think it's one of the most powerful and it worked very well for me.
</p>

<p>
	Of course starting a successful business is very challenging. But that's what makes the growth so solid.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not a business type person, you could also pour that same effort into a career of some kind.
</p>

<p>
	Starting a business is one of the biggest growth opportunities in life.
</p>

<p>
	Integrating Orange is about being very proactive about your success in life. Stop sitting around and taking it easy. Go hustle and work your ass off. Go take a Tony Robbins seminar.
</p>

<p>
	Because I feel it is more truthful and authentic.
</p>

<p>
	To me a real speaker should be able to speak without edits.
</p>

<p>
	Real life rarely gives you the luxury of editing what comes out of your mouth, so I figure why not just learn to speak fluently?
</p>

<p>
	You also would not believe how much time it saves in the editing using. In the amount of time a typical YTer spends editing his 15 minute video, I can record a profound 2 hour talk.

<p>
	This would be like the pinnacle of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect it to come quickly or easily.
</p>

<p>
	The desire to achieve a permanent carefree state will itself backfire and create lots of suffering as you will always be upset that, "Why am I not in a carefree state yet?" This can actually make you very miserable and depressed.
</p>

<p>
	So the solution here is to pursue awakening and liberation, BUT for fuck's sake, enjoy the journey and don't wait to be happy. Be happy now, regardless of whatever shit is imperfect in your life, regardless of your state.
</p>

<p>
	Waiting for a state to solve all your problems is not a healthy or effective attitude for this work. A much better attitude is to be willing to get dirty with life, to get beat up and keep going no matter what. Stop asking for life to be easy. Stop seeking too much personal comfort. Embrace the challenge and brutality of life.
</p>

<p>
	I have been getting more strict over the years relative to where we started.
</p>

<p>
	And it actually did improve the overall quality.
</p>

<p>
	However, as soon as we move in that direction people love to scream censorship, and it appears tyrannical and cult-like, as people say that only yes-men are allowed.
</p>

<p>
	It's a very challenging needle to thread. This forum has taught me a lot about the appeal of authoritarian rule. It's very tempting to just impose my will on the whole thing. But then people get disgruntled as they do in all authoritarian regimes. But the irony is that authoritarian rule, when done properly, yields to a better overall result. It's just that it pisses people off in the process. So it has a cost.
</p>

<p>
	This forum works almost like a small scale replica of a government. And it makes you appreciate how difficult it is to lead a government. It's much harder than it seems to strike the right balance between freedom and order. It's herding cats with sensitive egos, most of whom feel like they are not being listened to.

<title>What is the difference between God Realization and What is God?</title>

<p>
	They are the same. Just a matter of depth and totality. The latest one was a lot deeper, revealing more of how the dream is constructed.
</p>

<p>
	When you go really deep it feels like you're looking at the Matrix and seeing how it is constructed while you're in it. For example, you can watch you construct your own hands into existence or your own parents.
</p>

<p>
	You become the God process. You see how creation is occurring on the fly.
</p>

<p>
	Honestly, in retrospect. All of the workshops and retreats I've done over the years in various places, very few of them disclose how bad things can get in the worst case scenarios. That info is kept well in the back pocket until you're already a veteran and then you catch wind of wild stories. They are also not honest about their result numbers. Way inflated. Far fewer people get woke than advertised. Like WAY fewer.
</p>

<p>
	The nice thing with physical retreats is that there is a lot more control and supervision possible because it is an expensive paid event and it only lasts a week or two. It is not ongoing 24/7/365 with a rotating cast of 500 anonymous characters.

<p>
	No. Kids pass through all the lower stages, but more rapidly if the culture is higher, and sometimes fail to integrate the lower stages fully. Kid might rise to Green as a teen, but will likely not have a solid Red, Blue, Orange. But it depends on how the kid is raised.

<p>
	In between Yellow and Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	And still some work left to do on Tier 1. There's basically always lower stage work to do. Stages run deep. Shadows are easily developed and hard to unlearn.

<p>
	This is a list of action steps in each Spiral video for how to evolve to the next stage. Did you not hear it?
</p>

<p>
	Reading the Spiral Dynamics books is a great way to being the transition from Green to Yellow. You will become Yellow when you stop judging the lower stages and start understanding them as valid but limited POVs.
</p>

<p>
	As far as your job situation goes, it would be smart to start looking for a job which lets you be around stage Green or Yellow people.

	This is not accurate. I didn't say the ONLY thing. You can do multiple things. I just said handling survival is important.
</p>

<p>
	There is no reason why you can't ready metaphysics as a hobby while working on your business. In fact, that's how my journey started! I didn't start with metaphysics and philosophy full time.

<p>
	It's hard to say. You can do a bit of work each day, but it might be best if you set aside 10 days per year for a hardcore retreat. Or some combination of the two. It all depends on how your life is structured. I don't know what you got going on.

<p>
	That's hard to say. The fastest path would be something like an ayahausca retreat or a hardcore 10 day meditation retreat.
</p>

<p>
	These would not get you to God-realization but they might yield some juicy mystical experiences or a minor awakening -- which is all you need to start.

		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Very hard to say. Depends on your goals and desires and biggest needs.
</p>

<p>
	Reading books is probably the easiest way to start. You learn good ideas and can contemplate a plan of what is most worth doing. Sorting out your job/career is probably one of the biggest pieces as far as basic self-help goes. Do you enjoy your work? If not, you should work to fix that.
</p>

<p>
	The LP Course offers a very solid foundation for newbies to find their direction in life. But it is not about spiritual work.

And what I am telling you is: he does not. This is not an attack on him. This is something I say for your own benefit if you wish to fully awaken someday.
</p>

<p>
	I know you guys don't like to believe it, but I'm telling you simply that I have accessed levels of consciousness which go beyond what you hear from famous neo-Advita teachers. But hey, find out for yourself what is true.

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	You're not aware that all those points of view are imagined by you. You even imagine Rupert Spira.
</p>

<p>
	It's a trick you play on yourself to create "reality". If you didn't play this trick, nothing could exist.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is an excuse and a rationalization for not becoming more conscious of what other minds are.
</p>

<p>
	You can become directly conscious of all other minds. If you want. And then you will understand what they are.
</p>

<p>
	This realization cannot be reached through the words or logic of any guru.

			1:04:00 you talk about Christianity , and how we can make anything dangerous when we misunderstand etc.. But in Christianity in particular there is a safeguard rail. It is very commonly known for Christians that if you commit suicide you won't be allowed in the kingdom of Heaven. Basically exactly what SoonHei was looking for with that jump - to find/ be in heaven itself.
		</p>

		<p>
			If he¬†believed a little bit that what Christianity is saying is relevant, it would have challenged his idea that jumping would get him quick access to that. He would probably be here if he had more of a Christian background and had this doubt¬†about the suicide being "Good", because there is "nowhere else to go".¬†
		</p>

		<p>
			About "Repent and you will be allowed in Heaven" being like a visa to do anything, it might appear like that, sure.. But I have had an¬†insight about that one... How would one feel, when in Heaven, knowing that they don't deserve it... It would not be a good feeling and it would make heaven into a kind of hell, where you are like an undeserving dirt.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is not a critique on your teachings, it is a critique of your critique of Christianity.

<p>
	The mind will rationalize whatever it wants to do. It will also conveniently neglect things it even knows.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe the 10 Commandments say that killing is wrong. But a foolish person will reason like this: "Killing babies is wrong. So I'm going to go kill that abortion doctor who kills babies because he is breaking the 10 Commandments!" And there will be no recognition at all that killing the doctor also breaks the 10 Commandments.
</p>

<p>
	You assume the mind is going to be very rigorous and consider all sides of the issue but it will not. It will ignore obvious warnings and prohibitions.
</p>

<p>
	You honestly think that SoonHei never heard it said that Truth is NOW, the present moment? He obviously knew what. His sister told me that he Eckhart Tolle quotes on his dreamboard and talked about many spiritual authors he's read. So obviously he knew that NOW is the place to be. But he ignored that for some fantasy of a future Mahasamadhi heaven.
</p>

<p>
	When the mind gets stuck on some fantasy, it's logic becomes one-sided and anything can be justified in that way.
</p>

<p>
	You think suicide bombers don't know it's wrong to kill civilians? They know it. But they get trapped in some other fantasy and ignore basic common sense.
</p>

<p>
	This is a common misconception.
</p>

<p>
	It is actually possible to become so conscious that reincarnation itself is seen to be imaginary. So you transcend even reincarnation.
</p>

<p>
	So it very much is possible to understand such things. It's not belief or speculation. You can realize it directly.

<p>
	That's exactly my point. You are looking for war. And you create it.
</p>

<p>
	It would be wise if you made a distinction between looking for a fight vs seeking genuine understanding.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you are not even interested in considering the possibility that Actualized.org offers people some genuine understanding of life. You just dismiss that possibility from the start because that's boring to you. You want some red meat to throw to the dogs. But as you do this you actually promote egotism and ignorance -- not genuine understanding. And you slander my brand. Then you act surprised when the slandered party calls out what you are doing.
</p>

<p>
	The recent video you recorded about me is filled with so much projection and misunderstand that it would be laughable were it not so slanderous.

<p>
	Actually no. The bad PR is something you create but take no responsibility for.
</p>

<p>
	I do not control the lives of my viewers. If one of my viewers wants to jump off a bridge, he has that right. And I do not know what he is doing or why. Precisely because this is not a cult. I have very little oversight of people here. It's like herding cats here, not sheep.
</p>

<p>
	If you were an honest actor you would see that.
</p>

<p>
	We have a rather libertarian philosophy here of: as little control over people as we can get away with and still maintain an non-toxic forum.
</p>

<p>
	Actually that's not my problem, that's your problem.
</p>

<p>
	Precisely because this place is not a cult, I have no control over how members here express themselves on your YT channel. Nor do I care to micromanage what member here say to you.
</p>

<p>
	All I would ask my members to do is to not be rude, don't attack anyone, don't start fights, and try not to get goaded into flame wars and drama. In other words: BE CONSCIOUS! Which is all I basically teach. Just be fucking conscious if you can. Simple, timeless advice that is guaranteed to work.
</p>

<p>
	What this situation requires is deescalation. If people here keep escalating, it will get escalated. And that's how war happens, FYI.
</p>

<p>
	War sorta goes against my teachings, in case that wasn't obvious.
</p>

<p>
	It would be wise of you to acknowledge that the way you do your videos is fuel for the reptilian brain, so don't be too surprised when you call everything a cult, that you get people who vehemently disagree with you.
</p>

<p>
	It's a rather low blow to call something people love a cult, and then when they respond to you passionately that it is not a cult, then you use that as evidence to validate your original theory. This is called confirmation bias and self-fulfilling prophecy 101 and there's nothing nuanced or sophisticated about how that works. This is basic self-deception and it misinforms your own viewers who I assume you would rather be educating rather than triggering.
</p>

<p>
	See... you could do this with any popular brand. You could call CNN a cult, you could call Tesla a cult, you could call any spiritual teacher a cult, you could call Nintendo a cult, you could even call a university a cult -- and if the brand has passionate fans you will have triggered them to instinctively attack you, and then you would use that as evidence that they are a cult. But what you're doing there is not anything rational or scientific, it is just poking a hornet's nest.
</p>

<p>
	When you make triggery videos, people get triggered.
</p>

<p>
	If you're going to be using the cult word, maybe actually read some books about what cults are and are not. Or if you don't want to read, I have videos about it: Cult Psychology - Part 1 and Cult Psychology - Part 2.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with your critiques is that you clearly have not listened to much of my teachings. Or if you listened, you were listening with an eye for clickbait drama psychedelic stuff rather than actually bothering to hear the teaching.
</p>

<p>
	Your idea of God is one breadcrumb, which, if followed, will lead you to the real thing.
</p>

<p>
	Don't over-think this. Don't psyche yourself out. It's not so complicated. You are God. Now just become conscious of this. That's all.

<p>
	The illusion is not always so great. It's fun for a while but you don't want to be stuck in it forever.
</p>

<p>
	If God didn't leave a breadcrumb trail you would be here asking: "Why is God so evil to lock me forever in this illusion of suffering?"
</p>

<p>
	The breadcrumb trail is so subtle that 99% of people won't follow it. To follow it requires a serious desire. So it's actually a pretty clever design. It satisfies both kinds of people: those you want to escape and those who don't.

<p>
	"abused the Truth" is a relative notion. If he is happy with his action then good for him. But we gotta deal with the fallout which requires telling people that our teachings have never been about physical harm to the body. Which is true.

	If this forum continues for years, we will definitely have more suicidal people joining and there is always a possibility of someone following thru on it. There is no way I can prevent that. There are 40,000 suicides every year in the USA alone.
</p>

<p>
	If I am going to be personally held responsible for every suicide that someone who sees one of my videos commits, then basically there cannot be a forum, or a comment section, or videos. Holding me personally responsible for the suicide of a person I have never talked to is an absurd standard which you would never hold any serious professional to. And you would feel outraged if anyone held you to such standard.

			<strong>Consciousness work</strong> :¬† I find value in your work when it comes to your trip reports, protocols and research. There are few contradictions for instance when you say "what I communicate is only what is true at my current level of consciousness, it couldn't be otherwise" but then you threaten to ban anyone who challenges that love is the ultimate, or temporary experience doesn't make it less true. As per your first statement, and you made false statements in the past (eg.¬†that you were rewiring your brain during your enlightenment experience on youtube, or the healing in god mode) someday you may hit a permanent experience or understanding and speak differently.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is the nature of teaching and communication.
</p>

<p>
	I could make the same counter-argument to those who deny Love as Absolute. I could say, "You are just being dogmatic and one day you may change your mind."
</p>

<p>
	There are always going to be some things within a body of teaching which are core to the teaching we the teacher will refuse to compromise on. This is true of any teacher or teaching.
</p>

<p>
	If you go to a Zen master and say, "But what if the Buddha wasn't enlightened? What if you are deluded?" The Zen master will laugh at you and kick you out of his zendo. Because if you truly feel the Buddha wasn't enlightened, you have no business being in a Zen classroom. You should go do more productive thing.
</p>

<p>
	Endlessly arguing about spiritual topics is extremely counter-productive to spiritual work. Which is why we cannot have endless in-fighting and debate here. The problem is one of distraction. I want you doing the work, not arguing about Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love to me is absolutely fundamental to this work. If you believe I'm deluded, fine, but then why are you here? Go follow someone who isn't deluded according to your logic. I will not compromise on Love. You can torture me and I will still tell you that Love is Absolute Truth. If you think that's closedminded and delusional, well, I cannot help you. You actually misunderstand what openmindedness means in this case.

			<strong>Conscious politics</strong> : I mostly disagree with your entire conscious politics arc :
		</p>

		<p>
			- Spiral dynamics : its merit is to introduce some common vocabulary and framework of understanding¬†but to me is fundamentally flawed, especially the idea of verticality¬† (one stage is superior to the other). Let's compare stage blue and stage yellow : a stage blue farmer has a life of hard labour, has to work from 6am to 7pm, has little to no entertainment, manages to live like this for decades supported by his religiousness. A yellow stage academics spends his day debating people, living in his head building models and imagining interactions between systems but has the luxury of this time only because the blue farmer is producing food for him. If the academic¬†had to replace the farmer he would have no clue and couldn't handle the rigor of such a life, physically exhausting, no mental entertainment, he would be unable to take over the farm. How can you say that the stage yellow is superior to the blue stage ? The blue farmer is a stronger¬†being than the yellow academics on many levels (and the yellow is stronger on others, they are complimentary not superior/inferior). One counter argument is to say that the farmer can be yellow and the academics blue, it highlights another flaw of the SD : you can twist the SD model any way you want, if something doesn't fit your narrative just add a bit of percentage, eg "he has some green which explains why he said that but he really is mostly orange !",¬† it has no predictive value. Saying Trump is red is an illustration of that, you're putting him on the same level as a low education burglar or murderer.
		</p>

		<p>
			- Trump/conservatives : This point is linked with the SD point because there is the underlying notion of value that I disagree with. First you say that all criticism is untenable, that you are Trump and Trump is Leo, that love is the ultimate, etc. Yet you are so strongly biased against Trump that it throws all the previous statements in the bin and make you look like you don't integrate your own realizations. And don't say that your stance on Trump is compatible with those statements, you nag him, you call him stupid, you are not equanimous. I don't feel strongly about Trump either way, my problem is the implication of your stance to your respect of democracy. Trump is not Hitler, to my knowledge he never made hateful comments about races or minorities unlike Hitler, the idea he would put people into death camps isn't serious. Now Trump got elected on key ideas that he advertised clearly, and those ideas are certainly in the purview of democracy. Tightening borders is in the purview of a democracy, citizens have the right to tighten their borders, medicare, monetary policy, foreign affairs, etc all those are in the purview of a democracy. Once he was elected his political opponents should have folded to some extent and reevaluated their positions towards the choice that had been made, this¬†is democracy. If all you do is resist everything and refuse to reevaluate the slightest then you are not a democrat¬†(as in pro-democracy).
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's fine. I'm happy to have discussions about political stuff and SD. I'm not concerned much about disagreements there. I'm more concerned about constant debates about core spiritual truths which do not progress a seek in any meaningful way.
</p>

<p>
	Do not debate Love. Go become conscious of it. Or don't.
</p>

<p>
	The reason for seeking to minimize debate is not for the sake my ego. The point is to create an environment in which people's reptilian brains are not constantly triggered into ideological battle. These ideological battles make spiritual work impossible. I don't like debate because it is extremely unproductive. And then we have to waste a lot of time moderating it.

<p>
	Well, actually, I'm experimenting with imagination techniques with the hopes of finding some good ones.
</p>

<p>
	You also have to keep in mind that my work is always unfolding and new stuff is being researched.
</p>

<p>
	People have this desire to "be done" with it all, and they then tend to treat my teachings as such too. Whereas I treat the whole thing as a very long exploration and journey. But people love to bash the spiritual journey and just say, "Be done and stop seeking, if you're still seeking then you are doing it wrong." This is ridiculous position to take because I'm not in the business of merely reaching enlightened ASAP. I'm in the business of exploring new ways of doing spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people just don't understand this idea of pioneering something new. They like to dismiss it as ego.

			Here's where I stand.¬†
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Your work has not only changed my life and helped¬†actually turned my life around but also helped lay the ground work to not give in to suicide when I was at my most suicidal. I ran into your work after being in a hospital and it showed me the way out such that I now have had several enlightenment experiences, my relationships are better than ever, I've turned around many of the things that I've been traumatized by since I was kid including things like ADHD by providing resources and outlets and also community to find what I've been looking for my entire life.
			</li>
			<li>
				Your work has provided me a community such that I've met people in person that have helped me turn my life around 180 degrees.
			</li>
			<li>
				When I came across what you had to say about psychedelics in the early days I was on 5-7 different psych medications that were destroying my very cognition to the point where I couldn't function anymore. I was taking 2-4 hour naps everyday, barely able to stay awake, could barely drive, and at my lowest point in terms of sheer hopelessness and depression. I trusted what you had to say about psychedelics and that you recommended a slow gradual approach and also how they are not safe to mix with SSRI's, mood stabilizers, and such substances. I trusted you and I actually got off all my meds and abandoned the system was doing more damage so I could try this route in order to get to the root of my own suffering and deepest demons. Turns out, by and large, through extensive research (which you recommended), trial and error, a careful methodical approach, it did help me with¬†just that. However, like you also said, they were no magic pill in that I still had to follow up and do the heavy lifting.¬†
			</li>
			<li>
				You provided resources to teachers, some of whom have become some my own teachers personally. If it wasn't for you, I don't know if I would've found them. I imagine not though.¬†
			</li>
			<li>
				In March of 2020 I had my first spontaneous powerful kensho/satori where it was clear that no experience is ever enlightenment. So I do disagree with you when it comes to that. However, I've also seen you say that you are simply a gateway for newbies. That's what you were for me. I've also met plenty of other teachers (I just had dinner with one) that I disagree with about things they deluded about and I think you know a lot more on when it comes to society, government, mind, etc. Teachers and people in this work disagree in one fashion or another and it's expressed in about as many ways as there have been people. So I don't hold hard feelings like that. I think people are probably going to get lead astray if they just sheepishly take what you have to say, hear it, have some experience (psychedelic or otherwise) and taint whatever experience they have and lay some conceptual layering over it which is comprised of their interpretations they have of what you say based on what they create in their mind. I may think you're incorrect but they're responsible for their end. So I don't feel it's fair for me to fault you on that.¬†
			</li>
			<li>
				Although I disagree with you about awakening I do think your contributions on psychology, development, and so forth is solid enough and I think you are of great service. I can nit pick but it's just nit picking.
			</li>
			<li>
				I don't¬†consider you my teacher. To be honest you never were for me. You were a guy very similar to me, as far as I could tell from videos, which is extremely limited (for all I know you could have children chained to a radiator in your basement - assuming people in Vegas have basements...) that showed me the way, the path to what it was I looking for my entire life but didn't know it. And I will always be thankful for that. Anybody that says your video promote suicide can talk to me and I'll tell them to go fuck themselves.¬†
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Make of that what you will.¬†

	You think I'm some fool who has never considered that somebody might twist my teachings into some evil and stupidity? I have issued all kinds of warnings for years. This is not some recent development. All of this was foreseen years ago. I told you many times that people would look for ways to corrupt my teachings. Here we are.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental problem here is that I teach truthful things every directly. And people just don't handle it well. They take it personally. As egos love to do. I have worked hard to stay authentic to my style of direct and blunt teachers because that is what my heart is into. I do not like beating around the bush with people and withholding things.

<p>
	I should clarify. I am not dismissive of manual practices to the point of saying they shouldn't be done. I would say I'm just more realistic about them.
</p>

<p>
	Having attended plenty of meditation treats and others places which stressed manual practices, what I saw was many, many people who were basically clueless in their levels of consciousness. And these were not newbies. These were serious meditators with 10+ years of experience. So after seeing that, I realized that this whole meditation and self-inquiry thing is a racket. It's designed to lure people in with sweet promises and then not delivering them.
</p>

<p>
	The objective facts are on my side. If meditation and self-inquiry are so effective as you believe, then why are 98% of meditators not awake? Why don't know what God is? Why can't they say what Love is? Why don't they understand what Infinity is? Why can't they answer basic metaphysical questions about reality and consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	The answer is simple: meditation can work, but it rarely gets you that high unless you are ridiculously good at it and you do it as a full-time job.
</p>

<p>
	Again, to be crystal clear: manual practices are very important! But they are really mostly suitable for hardcore practioners. And still, you will not become as conscious as you could with psychedelics, unless maybe you are a genetic spiritual freak.
</p>

<p>
	I am tired of spiritual teachings which leave most people clueless and in the dark and struggling with decades of sitting on the cushion. Those teachings already exist, they are ridiculously ineffective, and I have no desire to recreate another such teaching. If that's what you want, go have it. Why do you need Actualized.org to rehash it for you? Go do Vipassana. See how far you get. The typical person won't get far. Hence I de-emphasize that stuff.
</p>

<p>
	The world needs a new way of doing spirituality which is more direct, more effective. My job is to research and share that way. Maybe you think I'm deluded for attempting that, but even if I fail, to me it was a worthwhile goal. And I have already discovered many amazing ways to speed things up. If only people are willing to listen and practice.
</p>

<p>
	They will become emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	Emptiness is what things are before you imagine they are different.
</p>

<p>
	Emptiness is pure consciousness of course. It's like white light polarized by a prism into different colors.

</p>

<p>
	God is not an easy thing to stomach.
</p>

<p>
	But assuming you dissolve much of that ego, then God is the most beautiful and enjoyable thing. It's like magic.
</p>

<p>
	Life is totally meaningless, but you can enjoy it regardless.
</p>

<p>
	Seeking God is for people who appreciate understanding the Truth of what the Universe is. If you really loved the Universe, you would want to understand what it is and why it is.

<p>
	The building blocks of reality are not atoms, they are differences.
</p>

<p>
	It is not that differences aren't experienced, obviously¬†they are. It's that these differences are imaginary and change at any time.
</p>

<p>
	What is salt? Salt is literally the difference you imagine between it and pepper, and every other thing in the universe. But if you realize those differences at all imaginary, there will literally stop being a difference between salt and pepper. Salt and pepper will become one thing.
</p>

<p>
	Your mistake, as it turns out, was to assume that salt and pepper are distinct rigid material objects.
</p>

			This is a comment I was going to leave on the other thread in response to Leo's reaction to video <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/7840-kieranperez/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="7840" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/7840-kieranperez/" rel="">@kieranperez</a>¬†posted. It's directed at Leo but anyone who feels to respond feel free¬†
		</p>

		<p>
			@LeoGura¬†I thought the discussion was open and as @Forestluv¬†said they came at with good faith. I do agree that they misunderstood some of your pointers and teachings, however they made valid points about some of the culture on the forum which has been brought up before in terms of turning non duality into an almost religious rhetoric.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I fundamentally disagree with this characterization of my work and rhetoric.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing religious or dogmatic about what I teach. Just the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	In that video, both people were speaking from ego, neither person was even remotely close to having a deep grasp of spirituality, and they deep and fundamentally mischaracterized my work, Spiral Dynamics, levels and facets of awakening, and so many other points that it's hard to list all the ignorance in that video.
</p>

<p>
	That video is precisely ignorance which misleads people.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing on this forum is about a competition for who is more awake. This is completely antithetical to my teachings. Nobody here is in competition for being most woke or most spiritual or most Spirally developed. All that is pure projection and strawmanning.
</p>

<p>
	I talk about higher and higher levels of awakening only for one simple reason: That's precisely my experience of the spiritual path. And any serious spiritual seeker will relate. It has nothing to do with ego or wanting to escape the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	The things said in that video are so fallacious and slanderous that I would be laughing had it no influence on a gullible audience.
</p>

<p>
	I'm honestly baffled how Adeptus can do so much psychedelics -- and run an entire psychedelic channel -- yet be so clueless about spiritual work and what the psychedelic experiences mean.

			One of my fundamental, perceived, disagreements is your dismissal of manual practices like meditation. Not that you dismiss them per-say,¬†but that you significantly¬†down play their effectiveness due to a personal lack of success¬†and label the people who have serious success with them as ‚Äúspiritually gifted.‚Äù
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, good.
</p>

<p>
	You are right. I do dismiss manual practices for several valid reasons which I have explained in the past:
</p>

<p>
	1) Most people will not be successful with them. The factual evidence of this is very clear. Almost no meditators are deeply awake or even have a clue what God or Truth is.
</p>

<p>
	2) Most people are not motivated enough to do them. And part of my job is motivation.
</p>

<p>
	3) Even those people who do years of manual practice will almost certainly not reach the levels of consciousness that I speak of. This is also borne out by factual evidence and real-world experience talking to meditators.
</p>

<p>
	4) For meditation to be effective is requires 100s of continuous practice. This is very hardcore and most people don't have the time for that.
</p>

<p>
	5) There are some people who can meditate with little effort and get huge results quickly. Such people are rare and spiritually gifted without even realizing it.
</p>

<p>
	These are actually profoundly important points for any newbie spiritual seeker to understand.
</p>

<p>
	And finally, I still believe manual practices are important and even necessary. But for them to be effective people first need to be exposed to mystical experiences, otherwise there will be no motivation or even an idea of what meditation is for.

	Well, there are no clear lines. That's the challenge we're now in.

	I am going to be lenient and try to give people the benefit of the doubt. I am very mindful of not just banned anyone I disagree with for personal reasons. And I am mindful of the problem of creating a echo-chamber. That's not what I'm aiming for. I do not want a bunch of yes-men here kissing my ass.

<p>
	But we must have some fundamental alignment or fit. Some people here are obviously very out of alignment to the point that I don't even know why they want to be here.

			The only point that keeps cropping up in my mind that I think is worth sharing here is on the nature of progression. It's undoutable that you did a lot of so called 'traditional' spiritual work regarding non-duality and no-self and so on before you started giving the God-realisation and Love teachings.
		</p>

		<p>
			Do you think that for anyone else who also wishes to explore God-realisation and Love, these other steps are important grounding work before one can tackle more advanced teachings?

<p>
	Of course it's important.
</p>

<p>
	Much of the stuff I teach is grounding work. I am all for doing the basics.

			When you said the universe would end, and discussed Mahasamadhi, I could not quite tell whether you were talking in a relative or absolute sense... That is, by "take everyone with you" etc. is that the relative sense? Like Yogis prior who went through with the act, they died and we are still here. You also spoke of final preparations... So did you expect relative experience would continue or all subjevtivity to cut out. Essentially from my relative experience I too would have died and ceased¬†to exist?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In that case I meant it in the most Absolute and final and radical sense. In other words, literally, nothing would remain. No, you're not still here at that point. Mahasamadhi does not mean you're still here.
</p>

<p>
	No material experience at all would continue. It's effectively death, for real. You don't cease to exist, you become an infinitely conscious singularity.
</p>

<p>
	WARNING: I do not recommend Mahasamadhi for any of you. It is to radical and you will kill yourself if you go down that road. And I don't mean merely ego-death. Mahasamadhi is not something anyone here should be thinking about. And it's also not what I teach. I spoke of it in that episode simply because I got close to it personally and I wanted to share it as a cautionary tale with you. It was not a pleasant experience for me to get that close.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I have explained Love a lot in my videos: What Is Love - Part 1 & 2, and elsewhere. Watch those again.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not merely understanding. Love is all the physical such that exists. Love is also the realization that there is not difference whatsoever between anything. When you realize that there is literally no difference between an orgasm and cancer, you will realize what Love is.

<p>
	Consider the possibilities that these are not fallacies but actually high consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you become conscious enough, you will literally be so conscious that you won't see any difference between licking ice cream and licking a hot stove. These radical levels of consciousness are obviously dangerous, and I have warned people about it in the past in my discussions of psychedelic dangers.
</p>

<p>
	How do you supposed a Tibetan monk does self-immolation? He literally is so conscious that he cannot tell the difference between setting himself on fire vs otherwise. The difference between pleasure and pain is ultimately imaginary. This very much fucks with your survival. You see? After you deconstruct pain, you have to be careful and wise not to do something stupid like stick your hand in woodchipper, because pain and fear won't be holding you back any more.

<p>
	Yes, but you're overlooking the obvious: it's true.
</p>

<p>
	It is true that harming the body does not matter after a certain level of consciousness is reached. This is nothing new that I invented. This is part of age-old mystical teachings. Yogis train to sleep on a bed of nails. That's what strong determination sitting is about. Those sits are not good for the body, but the meditator does not care.
</p>

<p>
	Just because SoonHei decided to jump off a bridge in a tragic way does not in any way change what is true about pain and consciousness. He simply abused that truth. Truth itself makes no prescriptions. How you use the truth requires intelligence, wisdom, responsibility, and consciousness.

<p>
	The truth is that there is no reason to not jump off a bridge. You are free to do whatever you want. If you want to jump off a bridge, no one can stop you and even your own mind may not stop you.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that most people don't jump off bridges because they fear death and because they enjoy life. As soon as you stop fearing life and stop enjoying life, you will probably jump off a bridge. So I recommend you enjoy life more. If you really love life, you will stick around to enjoy it. And if you don't, no force on Earth will stop you from killing yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You should note, all of my teachings are life-affirming. I talk about having a passion for life and building a great life and loving life. I do not talk about life as something to run away from or escape. Life is beautiful. So stick around.

	The human body does limit your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You guys seem to confuse two things: 1) Statements of truth, vs 2) What you should do about it.
</p>

<p>
	Many things are true but that does say anything about what you ought to do.
</p>

<p>
	If a yogi tells you that the body limits consciousness, that does not mean you should kill the body.
</p>

<p>
	The body has certain fundamental limits. What you do about it up to you. I have never said to harm the body as a means of raising consciousness. Harming the body NEVER been a valid Actualized.org technique. Look through all of my teaching and one example where I told you that harming the body is valid technique which I endorse. I have obviously never said that because it would deeply irresponsible.

<p>
	So what happens now is that there will be a lot of polarization, division, and fragmentation. Everyone is gonna be forced into a position of pointing fingers and taking sides. People won't be able to help themselves.
</p>

<p>
	So just be mindful of that and try to not get dragged into the shitshow. Notice yourself getting dragged in. This is a good exercise for you in how politics works. It gets dirty real fast.

<p>
	Also, guys, please... those of you who support my work, do not attack, harass, or aggressively defend me in public or on other channels, etc. Because people will just use that to further demonize and misunderstand what we do here. Be polite and not too aggressive. The way this PR game works it that the more you try to defend Actualized.org, the more people will call you a delusional cult member. So you have to be smart about the PR game here. This is not about truth anymore, this is all a PR game now. This is collective ego survival 101. So those who will be attacking and demonzing Actualized.org will not care about truth, they will care about validating their worldview. And in their worldview Actualized.org is, of course, very conveniently, a dangerous cult. That will always be the easiest, laziest angle of attack.

Do you percieve this thread as a feedback for you personally? ¬†I mean will you consider people responses or is this thread purpose to filter them out?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Everything I read on this forum is feedback. But of course that doesn't mean I agree with it necessarily or that I will adopt it.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, this thread is very much about feedback and I will certainly use the lessons here to make future decisions about how to best structure my teachings and how to deal with people in general.
</p>

<p>
	This is not just a thread to cull people out who are critics.
</p>

<p>
	I am open to criticism. That is nothing new to me. I get criticized every day. Any healthy community must be open to feedback and criticism. The issue here is that I see A LOT of people fundamentally misunderstanding my teachings. Either they don't watch the videos or they just got some twisted ideas about what is said. It is those misunderstandings that I want to squash.
</p>

<p>
	My first responsibility is to make sure that my teachings are correctly understood and not misunderstood. So that's the purpose behind what I'm doing now. I see way to much misunderstanding and that frustrates me. But I'll deal with it.
</p>

<p>
	No, that does not sound like a clear no-self. That was a glimpse into what consciousness is and a seeing through the illusion of materialism.
</p>

<p>
	No-self is simply when you clearly realize there never was a human self. It will fee like: "OF COURSE! How could I have been dumb as to ever believe there was a self?!!! What the fuck is a 'self' anyway?!!! Of course there's no self!"
</p>

<p>
	It's very clear and obvious when you hit it.
</p>

<p>
	It will help you to contemplate: "What is a self?"
</p>

<p>
	Like, seriously! What is it?

<p>
	<strong>Edited: After some deeper reflection, I am modifying my original post be more open and accommodating.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	This will be a master thread of sorts for dealing with the fallout of recent events, specifically focused on clarifying and discussing the nature of my work and Actualized.org as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	This community and my followers are going to go through a self-sorting. Whatever grievances you have with my teachings, express it here.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe my work has ever promoted suicide, you should leave this forum because you fundamentally misunderstand my work and we will not get along. If you have a problem with psychedelics, if you believe psychedelics are bad, wrong, dangerous, untruthful, and not genuine awakening, you should also leave this forum because we have a fundamental disagreement that I will not be arguing with you about. My work and research is deeply intertwined with psychedelics. If you don't like that, then simply find a community or teacher who does the classic path.
</p>

<p>
	In general, feel free to vent whatever grievances you have with me personally, or with my work. Whatever you don't like or disagree with. Lay all your cards out on the table so that we clear the air. This is necessary to create a non-toxic community going forward which is not constantly at war with itself. The general rule is this: don't waste your time and energy on things you do not align with. Think carefully whether this community aligns with your values, and if it doesn't, just let it go and move on to things that align with you.
</p>

<p>
	Is this a joke?
</p>

<p>
	These people are both clueless.
</p>

<p>
	They have no understanding of my work.
</p>

<p>
	This is the problem with this entire situation. Which is that clueless people will start to opine on things they have no understanding of because "it's a cult" and "I don't feel comfortable" and "It's all ego". Of course in truth both of these people are speaking of ego so deep they don't even know what ego is yet.
</p>

<p>
	So what will happen now is A LOT of profound misunderstanding and projection which causes people to completely get distracted from consciousness work and waking up. And that is precisely how devilry works -- out of ignorance and fear it mislabels true teachings as falsehood, while replacing the true teachings with ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	So this is how the game works. Be ware of that, it will be happening a lot.
</p>

<p>
	There is going to be a culling of this community. My teachings will polarize people, those of you guys who have a problem with my core teachings will have to leave this community and find yourself other communities, because I am not going to tolerate nonsense and projection here. Going forward I expect a very nuanced understanding from you of my teachings, and if I don't see that, you will be asked to leave. Nothing personal, but I have better things to do than argue with ignorance or trolls.
</p>

<p>
	I am not going to sit by and deal with people who have little comprehension of the things I teach and the warnings about this work that I have given out in the past.
</p>

<p>
	If you honestly believe that my work promotes suicide, you should make plans to exit this community because we will not be getting along and I have no interest in teaching such people.
</p>

<p>
	Those of you who understand that my work obviously has never promoted suicide, I appreciate your support.
</p>

<p>
	I should also note, those of you who disagree with my teachings about Love and God-realization will also be asked to leave. You have no business following my teachings.
</p>

<p>
	This thread is being closed, but I will be opening a new thread which will be a discussion about the nature of my teachings and you guys can vent whatever grievances you have with me or my teachings there. There you can also hand in your resignations if you are leaving the forum.
</p>

<p>
	I want to clarity for people who might be reading this anew that measures will be taken to further minimize misunderstanding of the teachings and make things extra clear regarding suicide and other potential dangers and how to avoid them. So don't get the idea that nothing is being done or no feedback is being listened to.
</p>

<p>
	Making the teachings safer and clearer is something I hold as important.
</p>

<p>
	But you also need to understand that they will never be fool-proof and people will ignore warnings even when they are given. The kind of people who are most susceptible to misusing the teachings are precisely those who will tend to skip over warnings.

<p>
	It's an interesting question. I don't know of a good answer. It's mysterious and infinitely complicated to explain what makes awakening occur in scientific terms. It's not even clear that there is an explicit answer.

			From what I'm gathering it is unclear to mostly everyone here that with this gentleman's death this community has just entered a kind of dangerzone of becoming a hotbed for suicide contagion. That he did it with so much grace, and because timeless nondual truth has little bad to say about suicide, and because this forum as¬†a place of spiritual exploration and communication is full of diverse people contemplating death (as they should be) including a fair number of emotionally unstable folks, we are ripe for a suicide cluster.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you don't know what I'm talking about please google "suicide cluster", "suicide contagion", and "the Werther effect". Sadly, we see this in high-schools all too often. There we can attempt to control the much more manageable environment and offer clinical help to everyone, and still multiple impressionable confused young people take thier lives. There is little chance of halting it here.
		</p>

		<p>
			<br />
			In short folks, this may be the beginning of the end of the forum. The days and weeks to come will tell. It will only take one more, and then there will be a few more. Investigations, lawsuits, all manor of demonization of this work, and a general complete shitshow will follow... Love peace but prepare for war üòû

<p>
	Do not fearmonger and spread toxic ideas.
</p>

<p>
	We are here discussing this issue so people can get closure. This thread is not a license for run hog-wild with crazy ideas. Nobody is here to kill themselves and nothing in these teachings is remotely about that.
</p>

<p>
	This idea that anything whatsoever in these teachings is even remotely close to suicide needs to end right now. There is no such confusion in the mind of any reasonable or sane person. Please stop spreading such rumors. Keep in mind that if you guys insist on promoting such ideas about my work, I will stop sharing my teachings with you entirely. And then you will be all on your own.

<p>
	SoonHei was nowhere near the consciousness or development level of The Buddha. If he was awake he would not have jumped off a bridge. An awake person doesn't behave that way and certainly doesn't ask others about it.
</p>

<p>
	He was simply eager to reach liberation via suicide rather than doing the hard work. Why spend 10 years meditating or taking psychedelics when you can just jump off a bridge?
</p>

<p>
	"Die before you die" does not mean: go die. He took it as that.

It's just a bubble of surfaces that create a perfect illusion of a game world. The world itself does not exist as anything but the appearance of the NOW moment. You can say there is only 1 frame to this movie/game. That frame is Absolute, and you see it now. This frame is God/Universe/Self.

<p>
	All of these are standard nondual truths.
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot handle them, then stop doing spirituality and nonduality. I am not going to babysit you.
</p>

<p>
	The entire point of all spiritual work is to realize that death is imaginary!
</p>

<p>
	"The secret to life is to die before you die -- and find that there is no death." -- Eckhart Tolle
</p>

<p>
	"Nothing that was real ever died, only names, forms, and illusions. The end of illusion ‚Äì that's all death is." -- Eckhart Tolle
</p>

<p>
	"When you have died this death, you realize that there is no death, and that there is nothing to fear. Only the ego dies." -- Eckhart Tolle
</p>

<p>
	"There is no doubt whatsoever that the universe is the merest illusion." -- Ramana Maharshi
</p>

<p>
	"Death is nothing else but going home to God, the bond of love will be unbroken for all eternity." -- Mother Teresa
</p>

<p>
	"Death is not extinguishing the light; it is only putting out the lamp because the dawn has come." -- Rabindranath Tagore
</p>

<p>
	"Death is a taboo in most societies in the world. But what if we‚Äôve got it completely wrong? What if death was not the catastrophe that it is made out to be but an essential aspect of life, rife with spiritual possibilities for transcendence?" -- Sadhguru
</p>

<p>
	"The only reason why people have such a fear of death is they know nothing beyond the body." -- Sadhguru
</p>

<p>
	"Death is a cosmic joke. If you get the joke, falling on the other side will be wonderful." -- Sadhguru
</p>

<p>
	"Death is a fiction of the unaware. There is only life, life, and life alone, moving from one dimension to another." -- Sadhguru
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	So please, spare me your crocodile tears about my teachings. My teaching are perfectly consistent with 2000 years of mystical and nondual tradition.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, your guys' expectations for this forum are way off.
</p>

<p>
	This forum is purely pro-bono work. I offer no guarantees to any member or user of this forum that I will reply or help in any way. I could leave and not post on this forum for 2 months. This is not a clinic, this not therapy, this is not even life coaching. There is zero client relationship here. It's simply a big chat room. No guarantees of help are given. And in fact, no serious help is possible in this format.
</p>

<p>
	Vulnerable people will inevitably come. Suicidal people will inevitably come. Drug addicts will come. Mentally ill people will come. Poor people will come. Criminal people will come. And it is not my job to help any of them any more than it is your job to save every mentally ill poor person you see the sidewalk. There are thousands of people in the world who need serious help. Unfortunately there is not enough time or energy to help them all.
</p>

<p>
	I help those who I can when I feel capable and have some free time. Otherwise it is not my business. I am not here to save the world. And I am not in the business of building out a mental health organization. It is a full-time job just to keep Actualized.org running, even not counting what nonsense goes on on the forum.
</p>

<p>
	Please understand this. No Youtuber or CEO or guru is running around personally saving people. Sadhguru or Eckhart Tolle is not gonna answer your email and talk to you. Sadhguru does not even show up at his seminars. It's just a video recording of him. The amount of time and energy which I have devoted to answering your guys' questions and problems via forum and comments is so outrageously high that you can not even being to calculate it. Nobody in the self-help or spiritual industry or on YT has answered as many questions, in such depth, for free, as I have. Find me one person who has done more.
</p>

<p>
	I spent an hour on the phone last week talking down Connor the madman. Just to get trolled.
</p>

<p>
	You are seriously taking for granted how hard I work for you for free. And if this kind of attitude continues, I will stop commenting and answering questions full stop. It will all be shut down. I have zero desire to play these social games. And I will have zero guilt about it, because I owe you nothing. I could be enjoying a drink on the beach right now, counting my money and smoking some DMT. Interacting with you and helping you has been something I've done for 5 years purely out of passion.
</p>

<p>
	I basically expect you to handle your own emotional stuff. I don't have the time to deal with people's emotional ups and downs.
</p>

<p>
	I talk about emotional issues in my videos but I am not going to hold your hand through them. This is totally unfeasible to do and you gotta learn to deal with it yourself anyways. If you need emotional assistance, that's what you hire a therapist for. And don't forget, a therapist charges $200/hr.
</p>

<p>
	If you were playing me $200/hr, then you could expect one-on-one personal help with your emotions.
</p>

<p>
	A doctor charges you $400/hr.
</p>

<p>
	This is an online chatroom.

<p>
	Well, you need to become conscious what is absolutely true about the matter.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I have answered the question for myself. I know it's all an illusion. But you have to see that for yourself to believe it.
</p>

<p>
	Beware! To see the total illusion will not be easy to stomach. And it may endanger your material existence.
</p>

<p>
	I reached a point in my consciousness where if I went any deeper, I would probably be dead right now.

	I didn't say "valuable" I said true.
</p>

<p>
	Value is a relative human matter. My concern is truth.

<p>
	Of course I never discount the value of permanent awakening -- whatever that even means. I just dispute people who say that temporary awakening is false, unreal, delusional, not valuable, or not part of the awakening process.

<p>
	I was speaking figuratively from a human's POV. God dreams because that's what God is, an infinite dreamer. God has nothing better to do but to play these games.

<p>
	That is not feasible and that will not be happening.
</p>

<p>
	I made a decision a few years ago when I updated the disclaimers to the Forum Guidelines that we are not in the business of suicide prevention or mental healthcare. Nor will we be entering that business.
</p>

<p>
	This forum's purpose is to be a casual place for chit-chat. This forum is a tiny part of my job and it eats up way too much time and energy as it is. I spend more time policing this forum that I do on any other aspect of Actualized.org -- just to keep the devilry in check. This is precisely why I never started a large organization or spiritual commune. The idea was to keep things small and simple and casual.
</p>

<p>
	In the future I may remove every social aspect of Actualized.org entirely. No comments, no forum. Just videos. Because that is the core of what I do. I am not a babysitter. I am a researcher. And we don't have any corporate team here.

	I don't know the details. Connor lies so much that it's hard to tell what is true about him. Suffice it to say he's got serious issues which probably existed for a long time.

	That is the whole problem. It takes a lot of time and energy to sort the truth from the games.

<p>
	Our resources on this forum are limited. This is not designed to be a full-service shop. This is suppose to be a casual place for basic Q&A and socialization. We are not equipped to deal with serious mental health issues here.
</p>

<p>
	If I had a way to filtering out mentally unstable people from joining this forum, I would do so. Because it is not my job to work with such people. But such filtering is impossible.

	He may get suicidal at some point, but he was certainly trolling me. He had no intention to kill himself at all.

	One of the reasons I didn't even take SoonHei's case seriously here is because I was sick of getting trolled by Connor just a week ago and I was dealing with all his bullshit.

			Im not saying the forum is the cause. I do think you can expect people who have suicidal ideas to come to this forum, so you better know a bit if you are the forumcreator.

</blockquote>

<p>
	We regularly talk people down from suicide if they come to us and tell us explicitly that they wish to commit suicide. I spent 1 hour last week talking down Connor Murphy because he emailed me and told me he wants to kill himself. Then I discovered he was just trolling me.
</p>

<p>
	So that is not the issue. The issue is that SoonHei did not explicitly say he wants to commit suicide. He alluded to it in vague, cheerful, and poetic ways -- and it's hard to spot that when we deal with hundreds of messages and posts every week.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with suicide threats is that they are often trolling attempts for attention. This makes it difficult to distinguish who is serious and who is not. Depressive and mentally unstable people tend to threaten suicide a lot even when they don't really mean it. I used to have an ex-girlfriend who did that, and she was sometimes shocked when I called the suicide hotline for her. She treated it as a manipulation tactic to get sympathy and love. Don't forget how twisted and deceptive some people can be. And then on top of it they can get upset when you call the suicide hotline on them. The bottom line is that suicide prevention is not our job here. We do it only as a last resort when there is no other choice, but for that we need to be clearly aware the person is suicidal.
</p>

	What's necessary to avoid suicidal depression is one thing: Hope.

<p>

<p>
	1) God is always doing it, but are people receptive?

<p>
	<span>2) 1000 years ago, 1000 years from now -- that's all illusions created by God to keep itself from realizing God is HERE, NOW!</span>

<p>
	<span>That illusion of past and future is what keeps you from realizing you are God right now. It's a very sneaky illusion. Notice how your mind tricks you into imagining some other time at which awakening will happen. You have to bring your attention to the present. Become so present that even the idea of birth and death cannot arise.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Imagine being so present that death itself cannot affect you. But do not harm your body. That's basically the point of meditation.</span>

<p>
	It's not quackery if you find a good chiro.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't trust your chiro look for a better one (who will of course charge more).
</p>

<p>
	But also, it's more art than science, so don't expect a guaranteed result. Sometimes it won't work.

			I have had the thought run through my mind in the past that goes something like this: "This is all a Dream, and all that exist is in my direct experience right here right now (as per Leo's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdWxdhEB19s" rel="external nofollow">Guided Exercise for Realizing You Are Go</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdWxdhEB19s" rel="external nofollow">d</a>¬†video).¬†Therefore if I kill myself there will be no family and friends that¬†I leave behind who will grieve me because they are just an illusion, and they will cease to exist once the dream of Tucker dies.

		</p>

		<p>

<p>
	Well, to understand this you would have to become conscious of what "other" is.
</p>

<p>
	You might be shocked to discover that "other" is your own imagination.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is that the truth may not be comfortable or useful to your survival, especially if the only thing keeping you alive is your belief in others.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful with your illusions. If you believe that Christ is the most real thing, and then you discover that Christ is just a fiction of your mind, and all you want to live for is Christ, then you very well might get the idea to kill yourself. This would be silly, but people do silly things all the time.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be safe, just commit to not harming your body. Don't take anything as a prescription for bodily harm. It's really not so complicated. I have stated this rule before: don't harm the body.
</p>

	This is simply, factually, not the case for the vast majority of people -- if you study the many cases of people's awakenings.

<p>
	Only very, very rarely does a human being simply go to full awakening is one breakthrough. It is so rare so to not be worth talking about.

<p>
	There are so many radically different modes of consciousness that boiling it down to one thing is just ridiculously limited.

<p>
	You don't even understand what no-self is until you smoke some salvia and can't even remember your own name or that you were ever human. That's some serious no-self. When you turn into a coffee table, that will be some deep no-self.

	You push to survive until you can push no more. That's how life works. People have different capacities and will to push. Some can push for 4 years, others can push for 4 months, others can push for 4 days. But we all have our limits. Don't assume you can push forever under any circumstances. At some point you will tap out. The point of survival is to never reach that point.

			There was a thread not to long ago about building a good physique, and Leo for example said that he rather keep looking lean because it's more healthy, and building a nice physique serves no purpose really. Only for ego. How can you build your physique without it being ego gratification, or is it the only way? Just curious to know more details on your take on it

	This is false.
</p>

<p>
	Many people have temporary and partial awakenings which come and are lost. In fact, this is the most common type of awakening.

<p>
	The temporariness of an awakening has absolutely no relation to its truth value. It is true and genuine even if it lasts 1 second.

<p>
	That's some no-true-Scotsman position.
</p>

<p>
	But if 40 years of professional Vipassana meditation haven't completely dissolved the self, then what hope do these folks have here?
</p>

<p>
	You are treating this issue too flippantly.
</p>

<p>
	I know many people who have fully realized no-self. But they have not realized God or Infinity or Love. Because those are higher and more challenging realizations. No-self is one of the easiest realizations.
</p>

<p>
	I could name names to you of serious people who I know for sure have not realized God, Infinity, or Love. And that is after years and decades of serious practice. So this issue is not merely one of argument for argument's sake. There is something profound which people are missing and refuse to acknowledge they are missing. You could be missing it too and not even know it.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that dissolving the self is not the same thing as God-realization. But, dissolving the self is important, so I don't ague with that. It's just not sufficient. No-self is not Infinite Consciousness, and no amount of logic you use will change that. It does not matter if your no-self is temporary or permanent, it is still not God-realization nor Infinite Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Also, God-realization and Infinite Consciousness has nothing to do with full dissolving the ego-self. It may dissolve or it may not and it does not matter from the perspective of Truth/Consciousness. It only matters from the relative human perspective. Which is important, but it is not all-important.
</p>

<p>
	I agree that permanently dropping the self is not the same as a peak experience of consciousness. I have never said otherwise. And I agree that permanently dropping the self is an important part of this work. But it is not the end-all-be-all and there are much bigger things beyond.

<p>
	This is false.
</p>

<p>
	You have always been God, so that's a moot point, but you are not fully conscious of what God is even if you drop the self. Realizing God is a distinct realization from no-self regardless of its permanence.
</p>

<p>
	Telling people that they will realize God simply by dropping the self is not correct and it will prevent people from God-realization. This is the only reason I am here arguing with you. It is deeply misleading and I don't want this idea fed to my audience.

<p>
	You fundamentally misunderstand my communication about God-realization. You are taking me to be saying something about form. I am not. That is not what God-realization is about. And anyway, form and formlessness are identical, so to even make such a distinction and minimize form is already a subtle duality you're creating.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know where some of you guys got this idea that I am against no-self. No-self is a basic, easily insight which I have had many times and I teach no-self. I have always taught it. But then I went on to realize much greater things which make no-self look like child's play.
</p>

<p>
	It is not that Frank is pro no-self while Leo is anti-no-self. Leo fully understands no-self but is telling you there is something way deeper which is being missed by even very serious practitioners of nonduality. But you guys are dismissing this. Well, I can't force you to listen. Somebody someday will get it. But not with this kind of closedminded and dismissive attitude.
</p>

<p>
	I hate doing these nondual debates but what you are saying here goes against something very fundamental that I have committed to teaching. And so I feel obliged to make these corrections. It is like you walked into a yoga ashram and started teaching Zen. Well, what do you expect will happen?
</p>

<p>
	If you want to teach your version of nonduality, by all means teach it to your audience, Frank. I have never interfered with whatever it is you teach to your audience. And I have no quarrel with you. But also, please respect that I have certain things that I teach and I don't like being drawn into these clickbait debates. I have better things to do than argue about the existence of God and Love.
</p>

<p>
	If you disagree with me about God and Love, my teachings and this forum is not for you. It is not healthy or proper to follow a teacher who you fundamentally disagree with.

</p>

<p>
	You are overlooking the fact that all of your reason, thinking, imagining, math, logic, science, and doubt IS direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	If you truly doubt direct experience, then you cannot even complete the thought: "What if direct experience is false?" because that thought is direct experience and therefore your own thoughts annihilate themselves before they even start forming.

<p>
	In general, the topic of death is very taboo in society. And for good reason. If you question death too much, you might cease to fear and hate it, and then how would we live? Life requires a fear and hatred of death. That is the ultimate bias. And playing with this bias is dangerous. Which is why exoteric religions demonize and try to control esoteric religion. Esoteric religion fundamentally is about questioning death. And you cannot allow that in a civilized society.

	That is tragic of course. But how do you explain Sadhguru's wife leaving behind her kid and family? Selfishness? Or maybe there is some higher purpose you are not seeing? Or maybe you believe Sadhguru killed her?

<p>
	That is a classic appeal to nature fallacy. Nature does not care what you do. Nature has no rules.
</p>

<p>
	Mahasamadhi is a classic spiritual tradition and practice. Comparing spiritual behavior of humans with animals is very misleading, because animals do not do advanced spiritual work. Animals also don't suffer in the same ways humans do.
</p>

<p>
	Trust me, if your suffering became great enough, you would kill yourself.

<p>
	As I told Connor Murphy when he was trying to tell me that I was afraid of his crazy antics, I told him to make a distinction between fear and caution.
</p>

<p>
	If some self-help book tells you to be fearless, does that mean you should disable the break peddle in your car?
</p>

<p>
	You see how easy it is to take an innocent piece of advice such as: "Be fearless" and twist it into: "So I should never use the break peddle and never use condoms."
</p>

<p>
	It's very hard to make advice that fool-proof.

<p>
	That's also not necessarily true. If he was truly ready to move on from material existence, then staying back for the sake of others would not be proper.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru's wife committed Mahasamadhi when they had a young daughter. You could say it was selfish of her, but that's your judgment. You don't know what was right for her. My guess is that Sadhguru does not regard her a selfish. He himself told his followers that he would do Mahasamadhi some time ago.
</p>

<p>
	These things are not as black and white as they seem.
</p>

<p>
	But this much is very clear: IF you care about survival, don't do things which remove every last preference against survival. Otherwise, what will keep you alive? Every one of you has to decide what is the bare minimum survival you're willing to accept. And if that bare minimum hits zero, realize that you are as good as dead. So either change your mind quick or prepare to meet your maker.
</p>

<p>
	Christianity, Judaism, and Islam tell you that if you die you are going to heaven. But who interprets that as an invitation to jump off a bridge?
</p>

	We actually don't know this.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe it was lack of fear. If one completely ignores all fear, and all caution, there is little stopping you from jumping off a bridge.

<p>
	Fear is there for a reason: to keep you alive.

	He didn't need to have depression or even suffering to do what he did. He may simply have wanted to transcend material reality. Of course that's very rare, but this seems like one of those extra rare situations. Which is what makes it difficult to preempt such things. Out of a million people, one guy might think jumping off a bridge is a good idea to get closer to God.
</p>

<p>
	In a certain sense, the only thing that keeps you alive in the material world is fear. Fear of what would happen if you quit survival. But of course if you quit survival you will not survive! And SoonHei's messages clearly show he understood that, but just didn't care.
</p>

<p>
	Fear of death is precisely what keeps you alive. If you lose your preference of life over death, there is literally nothing stopping you from dying. Even someone who is let's say full enlightened, still must have a preference for life over death, otherwise they would not be around to talk to you. Those people who completely lose their preference for material life will simply disappear from material life. That's how life works. If you don't want it, you lose it. Because life and survival are very active processes. You gotta keep working on survival every day to stay alive. Even if you are woke as fuck. Chop wood, carry water, do laundry.

			As for A, I've had that awakening. I do understand. I just don't think it should be communicated in that fashion. I had a dissonant experience as I was watching the video. On the one hand, I was seeing the truth in the concepts (as verified by direct experience). On the other hand, I couldn't help but feel that it deserved a deeper more loving way of communicating it. That's all I'm saying. Again, it's not an attack. Everything is Perfection, including your videos and our so-called arguments and discussions here.

	A video on the much misunderstood notion of solipsism has been planned for a long time. I am taking my time with it because it requires a lot of thought.

<p>
	Safeguards had already been in place, and more will be put in place.
</p>

<p>
	I fully agree with having safeguards.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I recorded a video about the dangers of psychedelics last week specifically as a safeguard against abuse. It's in the publishing queue, although now it will have to be delayed.

			People don‚Äôt necessarily want you to change, Leo. You are accepted and valued as you are. But, at the same time, what people are picking up on is the energetic level from which your teachings are coming. The last video for me was an obvious example. There‚Äôs an emphasis given on being right, on the idea being somehow absolutely true, instead of a more nuanced appreciation of what that message is going to convey and how it will be received. In fact, there‚Äôs this notion that the message will NOT EVEN be received, because ‚Äúthere are no others‚Äù. This is what people are criticizing. Now, let me be clear, what happened to SoonHei was absolutely nobody‚Äôs fault. He seemed to be an independent thinker and was most certainly not a fanboy who decided on a whim to do this. I tend to agree with you that he made his choice and nothing would have prevented it.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, and to put this in language that everyone here will know very well, Leo‚Äôs center of gravity is still Stage Yellow. You have not yet embodied Stage Turquoise (and hey, neither have I, obviously not judging); hence this notion that mind is the same as heart. It is and it isn‚Äôt. You‚Äôve had profound glimpses/realizations, but you don‚Äôt live from that place, which is why you don‚Äôt act with the kind of energy that we ‚Äòget‚Äô from those old gurus/sages.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A) I told you that that last video was the most advanced communication I ever made. Things were spoken there that few teachers understand. It is very radical. You are still not appreciating that the things I spoke about in that video are not what you learn from other teachers. There is a tendency to dismiss what I said as, "Oh, Leo is just acting like he's better than others, that's just him acting out, nothing to see here." If that is your attitude, then you did not understand the communication. "There are no others" is an advanced truth you still do not have an understanding of. Like really! You don't get it. You don't get how radical it is. No guru will be there to hold your hand the day you get it. It will send you into an existential spiral despair and horror. Then maybe you will understand.
</p>

<p>
	B) I certainly have much spiritual work left to do. I shoot the video as I am, at whatever development level I am at. I cannot do otherwise. And I have never made any promises or guarantees to you about my embodiment or energy or stage or whatever other standards you evaluate me on. In the end, I'm just a guy sharing his ideas with you. I am not your guru, we have no formal relationship. I'm a YT philosopher. I am on a spiritual journey and I share my insights. That's what Actualized.org is. So set your expectations appropriately. Remember, when I started Actualized.org I was a self-help life coach. Today I am where I am. And who knows where I will be in 5 or 10 years. I make no pretenses about my embodiment or the like. I share my realizations and insights as they come to me. I am also not infallible and not immune to self-deception, as I have stressed many times in the past. So you should think for yourself and verify everything in your direct experience.

<p>
	I understand some of you feel that way, but I am not here to be who you think I should be.
</p>

<p>
	I see that many of you are into this idea and are frustrated that I don't indulge your ideas of how an ideal guru is supposed to behave. But at some point you will understand that consciousness and love can be expressed in many different ways, not just as a bleeding heart.
</p>

<p>
	To me, mind IS heart.
</p>

<p>
	But I know what you mean and I understand why you want it. But from my POV what you want of me would not be true to who I authentically am. The more conscious I become the more authentic I act, but the more it turns some of you off because it does not fit your image of some happy go lucky blissed out feminine guru who personally loves you.
</p>

<p>
	I don't personally love you. I love you in a deeply metaphysical way which you probably do not feel or understand. And I am not going to try to fake a personal love for you to fit some stereotype of the ideal guru.

	Unfortunately that does not stop the trolls and cynics.
</p>

<p>
	But we shall see. I expect backlash over all this regardless. We will try to make the best of it. The problem with running any kind of spiritual community is that scandals like this will happen because humans are humans and collective ego dynamics are at play.
</p>

<p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Maybe. Still contemplating how to speak about this.
</p>

<p>
	The issue here is that people love to use such cases as an excuse to demonize the work. So I'm in a position where on the one hand I have to speak about the dangers of spiritual work, but on the other hand I have to do it in a way where devils don't weaponize my words against me. It's a challenging position to be in because there is PR aspect to all this and I'm not here with a PR team. People are itching to demonize Actualized.org in any way they can and so I have to be mindful of that while also being sensitive Soonhei's family and so forth.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is serious but it also needs to be framed correctly because I already see people using this as an excuse to let their projections and criticisms of my teachings run wild.
</p>

<p>
	I have a lot of nuanced things to say on the matter but the nature of this beast is that people don't like to hear nuanced things, they like to demonize and smear reputations.
</p>

	I will definitely make a video.

<p>
	I actually already recorded a video last week about nihilism which will be released some time in the next few weeks. That video clears up common misconceptions and mistakes of nihilism.
</p>

<p>
	But I will make a video specifically about misinterpretation of the teachings and the dangers of deconstructing one's mind. I am happy to make such a video because it is core to what I teach.

<p>
	Actually it doesn't matter. But that is not a truth most people are willing to understand or accept.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, Truth is a very radical and dangerous thing. Which is why Truth has been suppressed from mankind for thousands of years. The thing is, when the rubber meets the road, you will not care about Truth, you will care about survival and your feelings. This is how life works. It is a game, but its a very brutal game, and when you get brutalized you will not care that it is a game because you are too hurt to care.

<p>
	If it had you would have heard about it.
</p>

<p>
	We do have suicidal people on these forums pretty regularly though. Which is why I added the following warning to the Forum Guidelines some time ago:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			<u><strong>NOTE: This forum is NOT designed to deal with serious psychiatric issues such as mental disorders, suicidal depression, schizophrenia, psychosis, bipolar disorder, ADHD, drug addiction,¬†and other medical or psychiatric conditions. Leo's videos are not cures for such issues. Leo's videos assume you are psychologically stable and can live a functional life. If you struggle with these basics, if you are suicidal, if you are on serious medications, if you are an addict, you should seek professional help with such issues. Self-help and spirituality are not substitutes for professional treatment for such conditions. No one on this forum is a qualified suicide-prevention expert. If you are seriously suicidal¬†please stop spiritual work and seek professional help.</strong></u>
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I added this warning precisely because I expected someone at some point to do something suicidal and then blame this community for it. This was not unexpected given the thousands of weird people we get coming through here.
</p>

<p>
	It is important for people here to understand that dealing with suicide prevention requires a certain trained skill set and that neither I nor our Mods are trained to talk people down from suicide. That is beyond the scope of our jobs here. If we see someone who is suicidal, we generally try to talk them down from it, but we may not be skillful at it nor do we have the time and energy to catch every case of it. This forum is not a professional clinic or the like. This is a community of people casually discussing spiritual stuff. So it's important to set the right expectations. The Mods are not here to save every lost soul. They are mostly here to police against spammers and trolls. Generally we are too busy here combating trolls and spammers to offer serious one-on-one counseling or therapeutic help. Any such help is given pro-bono, without warranty, as our time and energy allows. But even so, from what I have seen, any time our Mods or even regular members hear of someone considering suicide, they do not hesitate to talk them down with compassion. Our members are actually great at that. Had Soonhei made a public post where he said he was considering jumping off a cliff, I have no doubt whatsoever that our members would have stepped in and talked him down -- assuming he was willing to listen. And I would certainly have reprimanded him for even considering such a thing seriously if my eyes caught glance of such a thread. But you also have to understand, I cannot personally see or supervise every thread on this forum. There's just too much volume of stuff here. And if you say, "Well, then shut the forum down!" Oh yeah? But then how many people will lose their lives by not having any spiritual community to talk to at all? So you see, it's not so simple. There are inherent pros and cons to running an online spiritual community. There will be good times and bad. There will be wonderful people and crazy people. There will many lives saved and a few lives lost.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of spiritual and personal development work is that is tends to attract some people who are struggling to get their minds straight. And sometimes you get people with really crooked minds -- where you don't even know how to begin straightening them out.
</p>

<p>
	It is also important to keep in mind how many lonely and lost people there on in the world who find this community and use it to improve themselves and actually save themselves from suicide. I have had plenty of people message me and tell me that if not for this community or finding my videos, they would have committed suicide or been stuck in some horrible depression or psychosis or some cult. But of course, not everyone's story will end so positively. Some people may find this forum and use it to spiral completely out of control. And you also don't know what other forums and videos and sources they are consuming besides Actualized.org. Spiritual knowledge is a very powerful tool. It can be used for the highest good, the greatest of evils, and everything in between.

<p>
	Just to clarify, this forum does not track editing history of posts or PMs. So whatever edits happened are lost.
</p>

<p>
	This is one of the reasons why editing of posts is only allowed for the first 48 hours. No edits after that. In the past some members have abused editing to change the substance of their posts, which is why editing is automatically locked after 48 hours.
</p>

<p>
	I am actually not sure if PM editing is locked at all. I assume it's a 48 hour lock, but maybe even not. Mods and Admins don't have locks like normal accounts.

			His ideas of "there are no others," and life being a dream that one shouldn't get attached to¬†made sense¬†for the most part. But I must say this whole incident has reiterated to me why one should stick with long-established religions such as Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Buddhism, whatever.... and listen to well-known "Prophets" and their teachings.¬†There is a reason why they have had billions of followers over thousands of years, without needing the internet to spread their message. And their message still gives people the tools they need to lead a good, moral life.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have personally come to the conclusion that this¬†whole new age spirituality especially on forums and youtube is extremely dangerous.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I understand your grief and emotional turmoil, and you just wish things had unfolded differently so SoonHei would still be alive. I totally get that.
</p>

<p>
	However, it is important to be factually and historically accurate about "long-established religions". The amount of death, torture, hatred, pedophilia, suicide, etc caused by classical religions is orders of magnitude beyond any new age spirituality. Classical religion is not "safe" in that way, it only seems safe because it is so baked into the social fabric of society. Many people kill themselves every year from holding Christian and Islamic beliefs about homosexuality being a sin. Or from other kinds of guilt. Or they kill others out of religious hatred. Again, this is because any large scale spiritual teaching will be corrupted and misused by self-deceived ego-minds.
</p>

<p>
	The things I teach are tools for leading a good, moral life -- without dogmatic moralization. But a good moral life cannot be guaranteed by following any set of mechanical rules. Genuine goodness and morality requires consciousness, wisdom, intelligence, responsibility, and balance. I teach all of these things more than any religion. Classical religion teaches mechanical rules, which is not sufficient to eliminate suffering, evil, corruption, misunderstanding, or suicide. Misunderstanding within classical religion is very high. All classical religions also have esoteric and mystical cores which teach radical truths about God, Love, Heaven, Death, and Awakening. Because Truth is radical by its nature.
</p>

<p>
	So my point is this: be careful not to conclude that new age spirituality is the root issue here. The root issue is the tricky nature of how the mind works. The mind is extremely self-deceptive by its nature, and then it will use whatever system of ideas/beliefs to behave however it wants. Those ideas/beliefs can be atheist, theist, Christian, Islamic, New Age, Buddhist, nondual, rationalist, nihilist, capitalist, socialist, nationalist, liberal, conservative, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	I know this logic doesn't take your pain away. But thinking that "the grass is greener on the other side" can add to your pain.
</p>

As of now, I am inclined to believe you that it is true. Although I have no further proof of it. I'm sorry for your loss and I understand it is confusing why a spiritual and happy person would do such a gratuitous thing.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing spiritual about jumping off a bridge. It's clear from his messages that he understood his dream would end. So that's exactly what happens. The dream of life ends. The dream of life is a beautiful gift and ending it prematurely for no good reason (such as extreme suffering) is a ridiculously unnecessary thing to do. Life is meant to be lived out, not ended prematurely. Spiritual awakening can be had here and now, without need of any physical harm to the body. That is the entire point of spiritual work and practice. If jumping off a bridge was valid spiritual practice, then there wouldn't need to be any teachings. The teaching would just be: go jump off a bridge. And obviously no spiritual person teaches that.
</p>

<p>
	It frustrates me when people misuse spiritual teachings in such gross and obvious ways.

<p>
	Connor is mentally ill, batshit crazy, and has no integrity. Do not associate my teachings with Connor in any way. He broke everything I told him and I warned him about. I warned him back in December 2020 by phone that what he was doing was antithetical to my teachings. The things he was doing went against the core of what I teach and warned about in my Become A Zen Devil video, and many other videos. He was chronically abusing psychedelics in ways that I warned against from day 1 in my video: How To Use Psychedelics For Personal Development, and elsewhere. He also lied to me multiple times. He lied to me about his chronic psychedelic use, he lied about mental illness, and more.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You need to distinguish between what is true and what is convenient from a social POV.
</p>

<p>
	It is true that everything is Good and Love. This truth make zero prescriptive claims. It does not justify anything and it does not tell you what you should or shouldn't do.
</p>

<p>
	Do not frame this situation such that speaking truth is discouraged or impossible. Myself and others are not going to lie about what is true just because someone might jump off a bridge. The idea that reality is a dream/illusion has been spoke of by mystics and sages for thousands of years, and this understanding is commonly available to anyone who reads spiritual literature. Do not act like Actualized.org invented this notion. All of the spiritual masters you revere and love: Ramana Maharishi, Eckhart Tolle, and whoever else -- have told you that reality is an illusion/dream.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, this is absolutely true. This is what serious spirituality claims. But it makes no prescriptive claims.
</p>

<p>
	It is not like Actualized.org is the first to say that reality is Perfection. This has been said by spiritual teachers and mystics across time.
</p>

<p>
	In all of my work I have never acted like relative truths and social issues are unimportant. In fact, I embody the opposite. I speak about Conscious Politics so much because relative social issues are very important. Nobody following my work should get the idea that a healthy society is unimportant or that criminality or doing suffering to others is acceptable.
</p>

<p>
	This is so obvious that to even shoot a video stating so would be seen as needlessly obvious. Do I really need to release a video in which I say: "Being a criminal is not good and you should not harm other people? Do not rape or torture others. Do not jump off a bridge." Would anyone who was serious about criminality, rape, torture, or jumping off a bridge watch such a video and listen to it? You see, this is a game that cannot be won.
</p>

<p>
	Also, much of my work is not about spirituality but personal development, building a good life, being active in life, living a life purpose, and improving your health. I have never discounted the importance of building a good life, even as I talked about awakening and God and so forth. In fact I have warned against using spirituality as an escape from mastering survival. I talk about the importance of building a Stage Blue foundation.
</p>

<p>
	But in the end, if someone decides that they don't want to play the game of survival any more and just want to rest with God, who are we to stop them? From our POV that seems foolish and unnecessary, but if a spiritual seeker wants to end his dream, that is his right and I will not invent some fantasy for why he is morally wrong in doing so. He is not wrong. I would just tell him not to do it because life is a precious gift and ought to be enjoyed, not escaped.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A) Truth, consciousness, and awakening are not philosophies. And it has been stated ad nausea not to take them as beliefs or philosophy. The dangers of ideology have been explained by me perhaps more than any other spiritual teacher. All I do is talk about the dangers of ideology.
</p>

<p>
	B) Great detail is put into the teachings/videos to explain how self-deceptive the ego-mind is, how selfish it is, how many traps in this work there are, and further elaborations.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is that the ego-mind will use whatever stories it wants to justify its selfish actions. If someone wants to blow themselves up for Jihad, they will find a way to justify it in their minds. My work goes into so much length about the ease with which the ego-mind will justify selfish activity and corrupt and co-opt spiritual truths.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of Jihad, I specifically teach about the difference between Lesser Jihad and Greater Jihad.

			And then what do you do as a teacher? You say "No no, this is bad PR, this is wrong! When I said everything is Good and Perfect, I actually meant you should behave morally because it's stupid to behave immorally!". Are you sure?
		</p>

		<p>
			See, because you are contradicting yourself, if someone truly believes what you say with actual conviction, he will laugh at you, as Connor does at Leo when he tries to tell him what he is doing is "bad". Clearly in one moment you say it's bad and in the other you say it's Perfection. You tell him whatever fits your agenda. And he will clearly see this if he truly and fully is convinced that reality is perfection, or that it is a dream, or anything else.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is no contradiction at all.
</p>

<p>
	It is simply true that everything is Good and Perfect. This is what awakening reveals. But how you behave has consequences and there are relative truths. If you stick your hand in a fire, it will burn.
</p>

<p>
	What Connor did was "bad" only in a relative sense, from a social POV. There is no contradiction here.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that I tell him whatever fits my agenda. It's that his ego-mind says whatever it wants to justify however it wants to behave. And this is have taught a lot: that your own mind will trick you and justify whatever selfishness is wants without limit.
</p>

<p>
	I also teach how there are many POVs and perspectives, absolute and relative, and that absolute and relative should be not be conflated.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It is simply true that reality is a dream. I will say this and teach this whether you decide to torture someone or not. If you decide to torture someone, those consequence are 100% on you, even though its all a dream. Dreams have consequences.
</p>

<p>
	It is important to give people warnings about misunderstanding the teachings. And will certainly do more of that in the future, as I have in the past. BUT, all spiritual work has inherent risks, especially when done at mass scale, this is unavoidable and such teachings cannot be made fool-proof. I have also said that many times in the past. No matter what is taught about spirituality, there will always come along some fool, mentally ill person, or criminal who takes the teaching and uses to justify whatever selfish action he wants.
</p>

<p>
	When Eckhart Tolle teaches something, "Just be in the now", some fool somewhere will take that to mean, "I can just off a cliff and just be in the now and things should go okay for me". Or when some Christian mystic says, "God forgives all sins and doesn't judge you", some criminal will take that to mean, "Okay, so if I kill my neighbor God will just forgive me and there will be on consequences."
</p>

<p>
	Where does it end? How many disclaimers and warnings must be given? The problem is that an ego-mind who is self-deceived will not be interested in any warnings or disclaimers or even reason. Meanwhile reasonable people will find the disclaimers tedious and so obvious as to be unnecessary. The mind has an infinite capacity for denial and it will do whatever it wants to do. We should take measure to prevent genuine misunderstanding of the teachings by reasonable and well-rounded people, but we cannot foolproof this work against people who are criminal, insane, or simply desire to end their life.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	I want to make it clear that I take this issue seriously and I am not just here to issue some blanket, self-serving defense. I want to make my teachings safe for all reasonable people, and I want to make clear to people the inherent risks of spiritual work. I have done that in the past in my videos, but I am also interested in being even more clear and explicit about it in the future precisely because the relative social consequences have always mattered to me, and my teachings are meant to reduce suffering and selfishness in the world. It disappoints and frustrates me when spiritual teachings are corrupted or misused, and when spirituality or psychedelics are given a bad name by irresponsible people. But the fact is that corruption and misuse of spiritual teachings is not anything new or unique to Actualized.org. Mankind has been corrupting and abusing spiritual teachings for 2000 year. And that is not going to stop in our lifetimes. But that is not a reason to stop teaching. But I will definitely teach with greater care to preempt misinterpretation as much as possible. It's just not easy to anticipate every possible misinterpretation. It never even crossed my mind that someone would decide to "consciously jump off a bridge". It's hard to even take such an action seriously unless after it occurs.
</p>

<p>
	I have said in the past that my teachings will be corrupted. Because that's what the mind does. And this will not be the last time my teachings are corrupted. The reason I record long videos is to provide sufficient depth and detail to avoid future corruption. But the nature of the beast is such that people will still find ways to corrupt my teachings and the longer the videos, the more excuse they will have to say, "But your videos are too long, so I didn't watch them." I have never been under any illusions that my teachers will be corrupted by some minds. That is how this works. I have videos explaining why this corruption is inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	But again, this is not an excuse. I will adjust my teachings to make them clearer and more foolproof in the future.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	A final important point:
</p>

<p>
	Let us not overlook that there is the possibility that SoonHei made a sober, conscious, sovereign choice to end his dream. In which case, as much as we might disagree or not like that, that is really not our call. And it is not correct to automatically assume that what he did was wrong or delusional. It could have been delusional, but it also could have been a conscious choice he made which was right for him. There is no way for us to know.
</p>

<p>
	This is not an excuse or a justification for anything. Rather, given his own words, if we are to take his own words seriously and give him the benefit of the doubt, then there is the possibility he made a conscious, sovereign choice to move on into the next dream, or into Infinity, or whatever he imagined. Personally I think it was not a good choice and if he asked me about it I would have told him to not do something so stupid. But who am I to know what is right for him?
</p>

<p>
	So the point is, this situation is more complex than it seems.
</p>

<p>
	It does little good for someone who is suffering to tell them that suffering isn't real. They are in no place to care about such distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	You also have no idea how much suffering they are in. You assume they can enjoy life like you, but if¬†they seriously want to kill themselves then obviously they do not enjoy life like you. So it's a very difficult situation.

<p>
	Guys, before you get too carried away with this, we need some evidence or confirmation that this suicide actually happened. It is not a given that it did. Suicidal and mentally ill people can often threaten suicide for attention and other reasons.
</p>

<p>
	OP, please provide further evidence or explanation of how you know this suicide actually happened.
</p>

<p>
	I take this issue seriously and we need to be clear about facts vs assumptions and speculation. Keep in mind that people on this forum do lie and manipulate sometimes. Sometimes we get people with serious mental illnesses here who behave in erratic and irrational ways, or play games.

	Yes, this is one of the challenges of doing deep videos as is my style.

	Subjectively, relatively, I've experienced it as melting into Infinite Love. It feels like you melt into the entire Universe.

<p>
	But even this is not quite correct because from the Absolute POV death simply never even happens. It cannot happen. There is only Consciousness and nothing else. Death is imaginary.

	Keep in mind that suicide is not so rare in the general population. 48,000 suicides in the USA in 2018. My videos have nearly 100 million views. With numbers like that, some of our members will at some point commit suicide. This is inevitable.

<p>
	Hehe, welcome to the wonderful world of idiot doctors. $150 is cheap. It gets a lot worse.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you got a double case of SIBO: hydrogen and methane. Which will be harder to cure.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. You cannot use any garlic if you have SIBO. You should avoid all spices to be safe. Just use salt.

<p>
	You are saying misleading things and I don't sense that you know what God is.

<p>
	I said the things I said in my recent video precisely because no-self and enlightenment is not enough to realize God. I know many enlightened people, and few of them have realized God.
</p>

<p>
	You can argue with this all you want, but I have made my position clear and that is what I teach. If you don't like it, feel free to teach whatever you want to your people.
</p>

<p>
	Those few who some day realize what I have realized will understand why I stress what I stress and not something else. Realize what God is. The rest is childsplay.

<p>
	You should be able to clear that out with the antibiotics.
</p>

<p>
	Try doing 1 month of natural antibiotics, carnivore, and no probiotics. That should clear out a lot of stuff and end your bloating. Although there are no guarantees. Gut bacteria imbalances can be very challenging to fix, especially if you have some underlying health issues like auto-immunity.

<p>
	Usually a probiotic is not a good first option. It is safer to kill off the bad bacteria with antibotics, and then slowly add probiotics after your antibotics are done.
</p>

<p>
	Many probiotics contains prebiotics which will feed the bad bacteria. So you must avoid prebiotics until you kill them off.
</p>

<p>
	Doing a month of natural antibiotics is the best way to begin this process. But you have to take them seriously, 3x per day for at least a month.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you got some imbalance in your gut bacteria which feeds on sugars and carbs.
</p>

<p>
	That's why carnivore helps, but also isn't enough because you gotta kill the bad bugs.
</p>

<p>
	Your doc can prescribe some antibiotics or you can use natural antibiotics over a month like Allicin, grapefruit seed extract, berberine, oregano oil, and others.
</p>

<p>
	Probiotics could help, but they could also make things worse. Depends.
</p>

<p>
	Getting a SIBO breath test will tell you if you got SIBO, which is likely.
</p>

	God is no-self. God is Infinite Self.

<p>
	There is no contradiction here at all.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing = Infinity
</p>

<p>
	BUT!!! Just because you realize no-self does not mean you realize God/Infinity. It's easier to realize no-self than it is to realize God/Infinity. And there are many degrees of realizing God/Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know why you guys are so confused about these matters since this is basic nondual theory. There is nothing controversial here.

<p>
	That's because she's testing you to see if you have balls or not.
</p>

<p>
	If you keep being a pussy she will lose all attraction for you. Sounds like it's already the case.
</p>

<p>
	You made her the prize so why would she sleep with a ball-less pussy man? No attractive woman wants such a man.

	You keep waiting for me to act spiritual for you, like some Eckhart Tolle. What you don't know though is how I act has nothing to do with what I have become conscious of.

	There is no way I could teach what I teach without all the psychedelics I've taken. Even with 40 years of practice I would not be able to teach at my current level.

<p>
	Do not take girls into the club. Take them out of the club.
</p>

<p>
	Taking a girl into a club is terrible for logistics. You want to isolate her in quiet area to build rapport and begin seduction. It's hard to do that in a club. You need better date location ideas.

</blockquote>

<p>
	1) You are being too needy
</p>

<p>
	2) You are making her the prize and she knows it. Stop making her feel like you are beneath her. She needs to feel that you are above her.
</p>

<p>
	You should have instead teased her: "Your friends are all imaginary" or "Your friends hate you". This sets the proper frame of you being above her. You did the opposite, making yourself look like a pathetic loser with no friends who is trying to get into her party.

<p>
	Let a few days pass without pestering her with your neediness.
</p>

<p>
	Then try to make her laugh a bit and then ask out for coffee or something like that. No clubs, no friends. Those are all obstacles.
</p>

<p>
	And stop putting her on a pedestal. You need to be cooler than her. YOU are the prize, not her. She should feel lucky to get a coffee with you. You've got it all backwards. Stop acting like a needy girl and start acting like a man.

<p>
	Actually I disagree with this Vipassana approach. It's too reductionistic. I understand what you are saying: you can deconstruct experience into discrete sensations and so forth as Vipassana loves to do, and this can be very useful and liberating. But this is not the same thing as a holistic consciousness of what things are. It's the spiritual equivalent of saying that the physical universe is nothing more than atoms. And this not correct. There is an understanding beyond the sum of its parts. Which is precisely why Vipassana people are not God-realized. They don't know what God is because you cannot know God by breaking experience down into atoms. I would further say that you cannot know what Consciousness is that way either.
</p>

<p>
	There is a holistic infinite intelligence to Consciousness which is not any of its parts.
</p>

<p>
	God is not any one sensation, nor can it be said to be just another experience among all the other experiences, like a table or a dog.
</p>

<p>
	It is sort of like one who cannot recognize a human as a human because one insists on only seeing it as a bunch of cells. And what I'm pointing out is that something very important is missed in that approach. In fact, THE most important thing is missed. The goal should not be to atomize consciousness, but rather to interconnect it all infinitely to reach the highest understanding.
</p>

<p>
	People like Shinzen Young, who spent 40 years in Vipassana deconstructing sensations are not God-realized. I questioned him very carefully. He does not understand what God is. He's a sweet and beautiful man, but God-realized he is not, and I don't want you to get trapped in that way.
</p>

<p>
	People like Daniel Ingram also do not understand what God is -- even though Ingram has extraordinary technical meditative skill. Technical meditative skill is not good enough. Losing the ego is also not enough. What's missing is a holistic universal comprehension achieved by Infinite Mind. The Universe can grasp itself using its own Infinite Intelligence. And Intelligence is not any one sensation so you will never find it if you insist on only looking at individual sensations. It is the classic problem of missing the forest for the trees. Vipassana is like studying trees with a microscope and never seeing the forest.
</p>

			There are some studies that prove, that porn influences your mind and thinking patterns in a very negative way in general.

<p>
	I don't buy those studies. I go by how I feel. I don't need some academic to tell me what to do with my dick.

<p>
	I am well aware of how cessation is described by Ingram and others.
</p>

<p>
	My counter-point is: Ingram is not God-realized. He is not conscious of what God is, despite all his cessations.
</p>

<p>
	And that is exactly why I stress God-realization instead of cessation or any other Buddhist thing.

<p>
	You can't let go of God because God is what you are.
</p>

<p>
	You simply haven't realized that you are God, or what God even means. You use that word but you don't understand what is means.
</p>

<p>
	You are God playing a game of denying that you are God. And you play this game very well. But I know the game you play better than you, so no amount of your logic will trick me. I've seen through the game. The only issue here is that you have not.

	Depends on how you define "fool yourself".
</p>

<p>
	But obviously you can do more and more spiritual work until the ego dissolves more and more.

<p>
	Will psychedelics alone be enough to fully dissolve the ego? I would not count on it. You have to put in serious work outside your trips.

<p>
	And I have never denied that. That downward path to emptiness, as I call it, has validity and usefulness. Obviously Buddhists are doing something right with their practices. Namely what they're doing is dissolving the mind/ego. This is important to do, up to a point.
</p>

<p>
	But I would still say that what's missing there is God-realization and Love. That downward path has a reductionistic bias. There is a tendency to reduce everything down to no-mind, and this is not something I'm on board with. I see value in it, but it is not the full path and it is not the highest realization as far as I'm concerned.
</p>

<p>
	I see far too many Buddhist and Neo-advaita types who have no clue what God is and no clue what Love is, and even worse, denying the reality of both, which to me is an abysmal failure. They have reduced consciousness so far down that they lost the most important part. These people are not as conscious as they could be, even if their ego is very dissolved.

<p>
	I reject the notion of "mystical experiences". All experience of any kind is Absolute Truth. All states are Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	God-realization and Love is not merely "a mystical experience". That kind of dismissive attitude is what I challenge. Likewise I challenge dismissive attitudes towards the insights revealed by psychedelics. As if psychedelic insights are not the real deal.

<p>
	I was mostly referring to PUA coaches and pros.
</p>

<p>
	You can do pickup ethically, but very few people do. Most PUAs come from a wounded and traumatized past and they fall into toxic stage Orange selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	In general I don't have a high opion of pickup, but it will get you laid. If you are struggling to get laid, it works for that, but you must beware of the toxic and selfish habits you'll likely absorb along the way.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is sort of a necessary evil for guys who¬†suck with women. Guys who suck with girls need help. They cannot just be left to wallow in their misery because that will be even more toxic. So pickup serves that function. But it will introduce its own toxicity as price of entry which you will later have to transcend.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup does make you a better guy if you use it right. But there is a cost, and many guys who get better just abuse their new high value by using it selfishly.
</p>

<p>
	There are also many degrees of becoming a better guy. My standards are pretty high.
</p>

<p>
	If you want high integrity, pickup is not how you build that. Pickup is about become good at socializing.
</p>

<p>
	You are conscious right now.
</p>

<p>
	This consciousness is Absolute and Eternal and God and Truth and Love.
</p>

<p>
	I told you before and many times, how long a thing lasts is irrelevant to it's Truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you do not realize that all states and experiences are Absolute Truth, you are not conscious of what Truth is.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is not some special place to go to. It is everything you see right now.
</p>

<p>
	It is wrong to regard only cessation as Absolute Truth or God. That's just more duality. Entering cessation is not at all necessary for realizing Absolute Truth. This is so obvious I feel dumb just for having to say it.
</p>

<p>
	All impermanence is Absolute and Eternal.

	There are no socialist states, basically. They all had to resort to capitalism to survival. Even North Korea cannot maintain it with their near total control of the people.
</p>

<p>
	Why is there not a single truly socialist state? And don't blame it on capitalism. Such states have simply not been sustainable. They were all totally corrupt.

<p>
	Then you haven't really understood why communism collapsed. It collapsed because the natural greed of ambitious and power-hungry people led to massive corruption and secret hierarchies.
</p>

<p>
	What happens under socialism/communism is that we all agree to level the hierarchies of power and to distribute things evenly. But then those who are naturally ambitious and power-hungry and greedy dominate these flat hierarchies, crown themselves boss, and take most of the resources for themselves and their friends, leaving the working class with pennies. Just like under capitalism, but it's even more corrupt and dysfunctional because it's done in secret with an air of equality and a socialist ethos.
</p>

<p>
	It's very hard to get selfish people not act selfishly. You basically cannot have an even or fair distribution of resources (the goal of socialism) without selfless people. Selfish people will corrupt any system for equality that you design or establish.
</p>

<title>Psychedelic with least amount of body load?</title>

<p>
	I think this will be highly dependent per person.
</p>

<p>
	For me some of the 4-AcO and 4-HO research chems tend to have very little body load.
</p>

<p>
	DMT feels very clean too.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT can have a pretty high load, but it tends to pass quickly for me into the trip.
</p>

<p>
	LSD is not so good.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms for me a very low, but this is alcohol extract. If you eat the flesh you can get some high body load on shrooms. Some people get a lot of body load.
</p>

<p>
	2C-B is one of the worst for me.
</p>

<p>
	To get it you'd have to go through many awakenings and surrender all your fears about solipsism and the like.
</p>

<p>
	It is too radical and too threatening. You don't want to accept that you are the one and only God. You want to keep playing social games and pretending like stuff exists outside of you.

<p>
	Yes, but the more selfish you are the less access you have to God's full powers.
</p>

<p>
	The delusion is when a selfish person thinks that he can keep his selfishness AND access God's powers. That won't fly.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite power can only exist with infinite selflessness.

<p>
	Crying and feeling love is nice, but you can't be in that state all the time.
</p>

<p>
	The thing with Love is, you gotta realize that it's more than any state. It's everything at all times. It is reality itself, regardless of how you feel about it. So be careful not to make Love a feeling thing, because your feelings will always fluctuate.

	Mostly 4 things:

<p>
	1) Keeps you company, keeps your motivation up
</p>

<p>
	2) Gives you advice from his base of deep experience
</p>

<p>
	3) Demonstrates how to do proper pickup
</p>

<p>
	4) Helps you pull 2-sets where the other girl needs a guy. It's basically impossible to pull a 2-set without a wing.

	Mostly it's a proper cult.

<p>
	I had a friend who joined them. It's not so good. His mind became steeped in their dogma to the point where I was worried about him.

<p>
	Even if you happen to awaken using their methods, they will brainwash you.

<p>
	Because a mob will come for them with pitchforks.
</p>

<p>
	You know how much backlash I get for saying what I say? The most serious teachers say only as much as you can understand -- which isn't much.
</p>

<p>
	Or, of course, they simply haven't reached the higher levels. Like Neo-advaita. A Neo-Advaita teacher can be pretty clueless about higher stuff.
</p>

<p>
	But, for example, I know spiritual masters who know about the existence of telepathy and telekinesis, but they will never declare it publicly or in any of their books or teachings. Because it creates a distraction for students and attracts bad press.
</p>

<p>
	If you tell the public that telekinesis is real, they will immediately mock and discredit you. Because they're too stupid to understand how consciousness works.

<p>
	If you take a high enough dose of psychedelic, you should be able to see your hand morph into a fish.
</p>

<p>
	But I don't recommend you dose that high. That high of a dose will really fuck your mind up. You won't be able to control it and it will spiral into a chaotic hellscape.

<p>
	If you took 20 grams of mushrooms, something like that would be possible.

			I mean, I often hear you say that it's likely none of your teachers are at this level, however at the same time I have heard of yogis for example having siddhis (as mentioned above). Further I have heard yogis say that enlightenment = literal death, ego death is nothing. What about those that leave their bodies at will? What about those that say they have to play tricks and have mastery over their energies to maintain the body? Are they God-realized or are they still imagining stuff?¬†

<p>
	I'm not sure. There's so much complexity to how consciousness works. It's hard for any one person to explore all the possibilities and branches.
</p>

<p>
	I think it's possible to have some siddhis without full God-realization.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I'm speculating, but my theory is that they are done through this mechanism but taken even higher. If you completely surrender to God and Love, to the point where your will merges with God's Will, you die to God. Then, you can literally will a miracle, but this miracle can only happen if it serves the highest Good and Love of the Universe. It cannot happen just because you want it for some selfish purpose. So it may happen, or it may not, depending on what is best for the Universe. You have to be totally open to the possibility that it may be best for the Universe that your miracle doesn't materialize, in which case it will not happen. But I believe it can happen. You just absolutely cannot turn it into any kind of scientific process. You can't use this power in any selfish way, you can't show it off, you can't repeat it in a lab setting. It literally is a miracle if it happens <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	But there is no fundamental reason why God cannot create a miracle. It is not limited in any way other than the requirement to be totally selfless and in service of Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	Really what's happening in this case is that you become so conscious that your consciousness merges into the flow process of God's creation. It's as if you merge with the mind of a Cosmic Artist and the stroke of his paintbrush becomes your own. You do not grab control of his paintbrush, rather you surrender yourself to the genius of his brushstrokes. Imagine if you were standing next to Picasso, watching him paint, and then you decided to merge with and become Picasso himself. As you did so, you would not be telling Picasso how to paint, rather you would bow down to his skill and genius. You could only paint as well as him if you had the wisdom to surrender to him. If you were arrogant enough to insist on him obeying your will, you would not be able to merge into him.

<p>
	I have.
</p>

<p>
	But also, the desire to manipulate it tends to fall away the more conscious you become. There is an existential trade-off between your level of consciousness and the ego's desire for manipulation, such that as you reach omniscience and omnipotence, all of your Will becomes Love and nothing at all needs to change because you realize that everything is already Perfection and Love.
</p>

<p>
	You go into it thinking how cool it will be to manipulate consciousness. And then you just surrender and die to the perfection of Love, leaving nothing to manipulate.
</p>

<p>
	You need to realize that all desire to manipulate reality for personal gain is corruption, ego, and delusion. If you become infinitely conscious all such delusions will fall away and you will laugh at how selfish you were to question God's design. It is a TOTAL SURRENDER TO LOVE. Love does not leave room for your manipulations.
</p>

<p>
	When I become infinitely consciousness I even surrender my desire to heal my sick body, because just to demand God to heal you is already an act of high selfishness. Don't ask to be healed, ask to love your suffering and death. Stop asking God for favors.
</p>

<p>
	Just keep in mind that it's not a human how. Your hand IS the how. But you can realize that you're creating it exactly as it appears.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are pretty much mandatory in this pursuit.
</p>

<p>
	The realization of "self-design" is one of the most important realizations you can have and without it you don't really understand yourself. God must be a self-designing entity. You need to penetrate to the point where you can see how your (God's) Will is materializing your hand. This does not mean your ego will be able to manipulate this manifestation process. But you can watch it unfold. If you take a high enough dose, you might even be able to watch as the fluctuations of your Mind morph the hand in various ways. This is God's Will literally imagining the hand into existence. This Will is extremely strong, so you're not likely to budge it with your ego. But at a really high dose you could even try and succeed.
</p>

<p>
	God's Will is 100% direct. There is no mechanism or process behind it. So if you're looking for a mechanism, you're misunderstanding the radicalness of the situation. 100% DIRECT! Impossibly direct, as Ralston would say <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	You need a solid dose of 5-MeO-DMT for this kinda work. And you need a very clear mind and serious intent. After you clear out all your inner demons and fears, then you can begin the work of studying the mechanism of God.

	It's not even close to the full God state, but I can recognize God in any state.

<p>
	It's more a question of degree
</p>

<p>
	And the degree is important. Especially if you've never hit the peak degrees. A traditional meditator cannot really appreciate what God is. They might have a taste of it, but not the full scale reveal.

<p>
	You make some great and nuanced points. I appreciate the serious effort.
</p>

<p>
	However, from everything I understand, true communism and socialism will never work in our lifetimes because people are far too selfish and grossly underdeveloped.
</p>

<p>
	But I think it could work 100+ years from now, especially if we start to modify our genetics and brains.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that no amount of reading Marx or whomever will address this root issue. My fundamental issue with Marxism is¬†that it gets human psychology and spiritual development wrong, and therefore it becomes unviable in the real world.
</p>

<p>
	If you have some points to rebutt my core issue, feel free to share them here. I am totally open to being proven wrong on this. Unfortunately I can't see a way you will wiggle you way out of the selfishness problem.
</p>

<p>
	The benefit that capitalism has, despite all its flaws, is that it works. The same cannot be said for Marxism. There has never been a viable real-world, mass scale implementation of it. This should tell you something.
</p>

<p>
	It is because of this that I advocate for social democracy. We know it works. It's hard to go wrong with it. And it is the next natural evolutionary step.
</p>

<p>
	The bruden of proof is on the Marxist to show that Marxism can be viable in the real world. Show¬†us that it works at the level of psychology and ego development. Explain why all the tried implementations failed.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with reading old texts is that they do not factor in or explain all the failed implementations of Marxism. This is why reading Marx¬†will not help. If Marx saw how Marxism was implemented over the last century¬†he might reject Marxism himself.
</p>

<p>
	The best moderm Marxist I know is Richard Wolff, and unfortunately I cam see flaws even in his rather modest ideas of democracy at the workplace and profit as exploitation. Although I generally support democracy at the workplace. But it is not clear how much democracy the current workplace can¬†handle before it breaks down.

<p>
	Don't give your authority and sovereignty away to others, otherwise their epistemic errors will infect your mind. It's like you're having sex with infected people. Stop doing that. It's not safe. Be sovereign! You are God, after all.
