<p>
	All the incentives are for the most selfish, manipulative, ruthless, and power-hungry people to win elections.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness is rewarded. Selflessness is not.
</p>

<p>
	It's an arms race scenario. The most ruthless guy wins. If you go into an election sticking to truth, empathy, kindness -- you will lose. Because your oponent will viciously demonize you as weak. And selfish voters want projections of power to match their own tastes.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness begets selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	Ignorance begets ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	It's always a good idea to develop.

<p>

<p>
	Wow, that is a surprisingly profound explanation.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like intuition is the key, and most humans simply lack it.
</p>

<p>
	Intuition is bascially a higher form of intelligence. People who lack it are like born blind.
</p>

<p>
	From my personal experience, I can attribute basically all my life's success to powerful intution which then opens the doors for everything else.
</p>

<p>
	To value and pursue truth one bascially has to intuit its importance long before it gives you any tangible payoffs.

<p>
	Yes, but if you think you can rely on development to awaken you, you'll be very disappointed. It won't.
</p>

<p>
	If you want awakening, the only way to get it is to work your ass for it with intense focus and clarity of purpose.
</p>

<p>
	No hardcore spiritual practices, no awaken. It's that simple.
</p>

<p>
	Which is the reason 99.9999% of people are not awake and will never be awake.
</p>

<p>
	That's why spiritual practices are required and enlightenment is required.
</p>

<p>
	Taking a psychedelic does not make you enlightened. It gives you a peak at what you can become with hardcore spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	You got the peak, but you don't want to do any hardcore spiritual practice. That's your problem. You are expecting psychedelics to be a magic pill.

<p>
	Need to learn to get out of your head and be focused enjoying her.
</p>

<p>
	The best advice for having sex with a woman is that once the clothes come off, you throw out all your doubts and hesitations, you grab her, and do whatever you want with her. Don't be meek here. Fuck her how you want to fuck her. She wants you to take her without any reservations. Take her in your unique and authentic way.
</p>

<p>
	Put 100% of your focus on that process, and you will find yourself not in your head any more.

So steel yourself against that. You need to become very internally grounded in your truth, intuition, and vision. Don't let societal group-think tell you what is right.

	Death is infinite love, but the one dying does not know that. And we can't have people running around trying to kill each other.

	There can't be a wise system when fools make up a majority of the base.

<p>
	The people are as much to blame as the elites.

An epic shit <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	If your doses are moderate, then you got nothing to worry about. It's only the really high dose trips are get iffy. And even then, the chances of you not coming back are exceedingly low. People have done massive doses and come back. 30mg of plugged 5-MeO-DMT will freak you the fuck out. But it will not kill you unless you have some pre-existing medical condition or combine it with other drugs.

<p>
	Basically, yes.
</p>

<p>
	But in practice, no, because you take low doses and so you rarely reach the ultimate 100% Godhead state.
</p>

<p>
	Physically dying from a psychedelic is extremely rare.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well ask, "So every time you get in a car you have to go into it as if you are committing suicide?"
</p>

<p>
	Way more people die from cars than psychedelics, so your fears are not well grounded.
</p>

<p>
	Mahasamadhi is not something that happens to you accidentally. It is a conscious choice to leave behind the dream world.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you could always accidentally kill the physical body if you take way too much of a dose. But that would be the equivalent of driving your car into a wall. That is your fault.

<p>
	Well, you may not come back. Which is what makes it scary.
</p>

<p>
	Or you may come back, in which case you will see that as just part of how you got here.
</p>

<p>
	You don't know. That's the whole point. It requires the ultimate leap of faith and surrender to death.
</p>

<p>
	If you are scared about not coming back, then you are not ready to see 100% Godhead and so you probably won't see it. You have to shift your orientation 180 degrees to want the Godhead more than this material dream. If you value the material dream more than the Godhead, then you will stay in the material dream. Which is why you're in the material dream to begin with. You wanted to be here otherwise you'd have killed yourself long ago.

<p>
	They are useful within a very narrow context. You can use it to understand the mathematical aspects of the universe, which is like looking at one facet of an infinite jewel.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to see the whole jewel, you'll have to transcend the narrow confines of mathematics as a domain. The domain itself is the limit. If you want a holistic understanding you cannot confine yourself to any one domain.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, he did harm lots of people by poisoning their minds. Trumpism can be directly traced to Rush.
</p>

<p>
	To compare Rush to Obama is absurd. Obama is a conscious guy that tried to lift people up.
</p>

<p>
	I don't wish anyone death, and I don't hate anyone. But to praise Rush is a step too far. He had a very toxic influence on our social fabric. That will be his legacy in the history books. Our society is def better without him.
</p>

<p>
	None of this contradicts Love. Love does not mean praising assholes who poison society.
</p>

<p>
	I say all this without any hatred for him. He was just ignorant and unconscious.

	I've tripped over 100 times and not once have I thought, "You know what this is missing? A human yapping in my ear with his human bullshit."

<p>
	The only human I have interest in tripping with is a sexual partner.

<p>
	It is not wise to try to convince someone who is scared of psychedelics to take them. Such a person is clearly not mature enough and is likely to spiral into a bad trip and then blame it on you to boot.

<p>
	It depends on how conscious you are and your ability to interconnect those words and experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Some contemplation and mental effort is necessary. You should contemplate each of those words and concepts. Then one day you will encounter what they really refer to.

<p>
	Yes, well, I factor that into everything I say. The answers are definitive but they are still just a map. You can have a very definitive, clear, good map. But it ain't ever the thing it maps.

<p>
	You don't appreciate how deep this goes. We don't need to sit together. When you awaken you will realize I am you. Literally. You will realize that I have been living through your body your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	I am you! Lol
</p>

<p>
	Truth is absolute. Don't go asking someone else to validate it because there is no one else in the universe but you. The only one who can validate Absolute Truth, is you. This is not a mistake, this is the nature of Absolute Truth.

<title>Verifying a Direct Experience</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	A) Take psychedelic to have your first glimpse of "direct experience".
</p>

<p>
	Although of course you have direct experience without psychedelics too. If I tell you the sun shines in the morning, you don't need to believe me. You can experience it for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	B) All language is relative. But within the relative terms we generally agree upon, a pretty accurate description of reality is possible. But of course you don't have reference experiences yet for terms like God, Love, Infinity, Truth, Good, Consciousness, etc. So you'll have to acquire those reference experiences before you can know what they really mean. The only reason you know what a "sun" is, is because you have reference experience for that word.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, the map is not the territory. The notion of "the sun" is not the same as the actual sun itself.
</p>

<p>
	I give direct, definitive answers, but they are still just a symbol, not the thing itself. For some reason you have no problem accepting when someone tells you clearly and definitively that the sun is shining outside. Yet you have a problem with my answers.
</p>

<p>
	I can be so certain because I became infinite conscious. You can too.
</p>

<p>
	He would probably agree with that whole series. We have a very similar understanding of epistemology. It's just that his metaphysics is lacking.
</p>

<p>
	Daniel is the only guy I've seen who has as deep an understanding of epistemology as me. But his still cannot reach all the way because to finally understand epistemology one must realize that epistemology = metaphysics.

<p>
	Ken Wilber would probably be the closest. But I doubt how deep Wilber's consciousness really is. My guess is, not the deepest. He too is lost in intellectualizations and models.

<p>
	Too much left-brain thinking is a very dangerous thing.

			Have you come across Forrest Landry yet? He's a good friend of Daniels. This is his metaphysics ^ I would be interested to hear your thoughts on it.<br />

			Also, how do you relate to the wave of emerging thought that the Transjective ( relationship )  is more fundamental than subjective or objective.

<p>
	I have not looked deeply into it, but sounds like BS to me. That kind of manner of thinking about realty will not get you to infinite consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But I could be wrong. I haven't read the whole thing, just skimmed a few parts.
</p>

<p>
	Just by the fact that Daniel recommends it, I basically know it must be fundamentally wrong because Daniel does not understand what reality is.

<p>
	I will also add that you should pay attention to your biases.
</p>

<p>
	Thousands of people die every day who you don't give a damn about.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at the universe without any biases, you will realize that there was nothing special about Kobe over any of those people who die every day.
</p>

<p>
	So what causes your suffering is your bias.
</p>

<p>
	The degree to which our culture glorifies celebrity deaths is absurd. Nobody's death is more important than anyone else's. Success does not make one's death more important.

What were are actually talking about are chemicals and specifically neurotransmitters. Psychedelics are not drugs. They are neurotransmitters. Makes no difference whether they are endogenous or not. Just like it makes no difference when you eat food whether the chemicals in the food are endogenous. If those chemicals are of the right kind, they will still improve your health.

<p>
	There is a ton of validated research studies on the horrific effects of heavy metals like lead and mercury on brain function and its development. Google it.
</p>

<p>
	Heavy metal toxicity causes autoimmune diseases, autism, ADD, cancer, and a bunch of other nasty things.
</p>

<p>
	There is no safe level of heavy metals. Even if you have a little bit, it ruins your body's performance.

<p>
	You can reach hook point very fast if you are talking to her with sexual intent and flirting. If you're just being social and boring, then it will take longer.
</p>

<p>
	As long as you're being flirty, 5 mins is mostly all you need regardless of club or day. It does not take a girl long to decide whether she would sleep with you. She doesn't need 3 hours to figure that out. She'll know within about 5 mins if you are active about it. You need to make her feel your sexual intent without being explicit about it. Force her to explicitly reject you.

<p>
	Certainly you gotta learn how to lead and how to close after hook point. But that's pretty easy, especially outside the club.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter how you look if you reach hook point she has already accepted your looks and will sleep with you as long as you don't creep her out with weird behavior.

<p>
	It's a bit helpful, but not worth the effort in my opinion. If you want to work out for yourself, that's great. But don't do it for the girls.

<p>
	A good rule of thumb for where to start is always: wherever you feel most passionate and inspired.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you feel inspired to start going to the gym, then start there. Don't let good passion go to waste.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, follow your bliss.
</p>

<p>
	Passion, acted up, builds on itself.

	Of course smart does not mean awakened or God-realized or perfect. Smart people can still say dumb things. And I have heard both these guys say a few dumb things. But that doesn't mean they aren't smart.

		<p>
			According to him the goal of every ego is to find the peace and happiness inherent in being. I don't really see you talking about that, so do you think there's stuff worth pursuing beyond peace and happiness she rupert is deluded, or are you going to seek happiness after going deeper with psychs?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Does not contradict anything I teach.
</p>

<p>
	Happiness is the fruit of doing all the work. But I would not purse happiness directly. Rather pursue truth, wisdom, consciousness, selflessness, and love. If you do that, you'll optimize your happiness.
</p>

<p>
	Peace is the natural byproduct of truth and awakening.

<p>
	Whenever you say something is "real", that's always a relative statement. You have to consider the context which makes it "true". It is not absolutely true, it's true relative to some larger context.
</p>

<p>
	Society is "real" relative to the context of normal human life (which is just a dream).
</p>

<p>
	Calling society unreal in a normal human context is just a waste of time, confuses people, and even leads to evil.

That was the gist of the video.
</p>

<p>
	When I say "fragments of consciousness" this is a relative description of things.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that God can be described from different levels of description, using different paradigms, none of which is ever quite right.
</p>

<p>
	I still speak of other humans and beings, but this is bracketed in my mind as relative speech. It is not absolutely true. I speak of them because we operate within that relative paradigm most to the time. But deep down in my deepest understanding I know other people are imaginary. But I don't treat them as such most of the time because it is not practical.
</p>

<p>
	Hold my descriptions more loosely. This will save you some headaches.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, the things I try to communicate and describe are so far out there that I struggle and rack my mind just to figure out how to articulate them. My articulation improves over time as I find better ways. "Fragments of consciousness" is not a very good articulation if we're talking about the highest levels. It's best to think of that phrase in this context: IF you assume/imagine that others exist, THEN the things I said about fragments of consciousness apply and hold true. But IF you become so conscious that you realize others are just imagined by your mind, THEN there are no fragments of consciousness to speak of since they were just figments of your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Since most of you guys imagine others are "real", that's the level I'm talking to most of the time. I'm sorta meeting you half-way within your paradigm. Otherwise things sound very radical and alien because I would be talking from a totally disconnected paradigm from yours. Bridging these paradigm is basically impossible, but we try.
</p>

<p>
	Good work, but you have only scratched the surface. You have no idea how much more there is.
</p>

<p>
	And you are still confused, unclear about many things. You still don't really understand reality or existence or God or Love or Goodness or Infinity or evil or many other important things.
</p>

<p>
	And you are still not enlightened or awake. Perhaps you had some awakening, but now it is gone and you are back in the old ego state. So there is much work to do. A memory of a trip will not do much for you developmentally or spiritually.
</p>

<p>
	It will take you 100+ trips to start getting a handle on psychedelics. And mushrooms are one of the least clear psychedelics. You can get much higher levels of awakening and clarity with other substances. Although mushrooms are good for now.
</p>

<p>
	There is certainly much point to doing more psychedelics, higher doses, and other kinds. But with your myopic attitude, maybe there is no point for you.
</p>

It just requires a lot of inner work and tripping.
</p>

<p>
	Took me some 70+ trips
</p>

<p>
	And that doesn't count other trips. That's pure 5-MeO-DMT trips. In total it took me about 100+ trips.
</p>

<p>
	You could potentially access it through yoga or meditation, but that will takes you decades of full-time work and you will have to be exceptionally spiritually gifted/talented from birth.
</p>

<p>
	My aim is not to discourage you, but to make you cognizant of how rare and challenging this highest consciousness is. If you want it you will have to devote your life to pursuing it. It's not gonna be something you get from a 10 day Vipasanna retreat so something piddly thing like that. We're talking about boring a hole through the fabric of reality.

<p>
	Well, firstly I should say, it is a beauty documentary. So props to him.
</p>

<p>
	I was just commenting on his doubt/denial that what he experienced was God. That is the danger of skepticism.
</p>

<p>
	Did I realize on my first trip? No. My first 5-MeO-DMT was minor and it gave me a panic attack. I wasn't taking vaped epic doses like he did.
</p>

<p>
	I don't blast myself with massive doses. I take smaller doses and actually contemplate reality so that I understand what is happening. Blasting yourself to heaven is not the best way.

It's never going to be precise because the infinite cannot be made finite.
</p>

<p>
	I could talk for 10 years and there will be shit missing. All my videos have lots of shit missing and they are constantly improving. Every day my understanding deepens.
</p>

<p>
	These videos are pointers to things you should be seeking yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The map is not the territory.
</p>

<p>
	If you wish to be wise, realize that you cannot get to God through my answers.

<p>
	The problem is that you are trying to understand this using dualistic categories such as self vs other, one vs many, and all these categories collapse at high levels of consciousness such that your questions cannot even be formed.
</p>

<p>
	You assume there is an objective difference between one vs many illusions, but no such objective difference exists, it is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	God has infinite power, but your human intelligence is incapable of understanding why it chooses to deploy its power as it does. You find it lame, that's just your limited view.

<p>
	No one cares about your muscles but your own ego. No girl is gonna fuck you because of your muscles unless you look like a pro bodybuilder. You would get more sex if you invested your time at the gym into talking to girls.
</p>

<p>
	Grooming, dress, and hygiene you should certainly optimize. But that's so basic I don't even consider it "looks".

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The mind has very serious limits as to what it is able to understand no matter how hard it works because the bottleneck ends up being one's state of consciousness. So releasing that bottleneck becomes the key after a certain point. And the more you invest in the mind the harder it can be to release that bottleneck. The mind ends up trapped in itself and digs its trap even deeper. That is the biggest trap for intellectual people.
</p>

<p>
	Daniel needs to hit a bunch of DMT, over and over again to break his entire mind open.
</p>

<p>
	He has intellectualized nonduality/awakening, but I sense he has no experience with what it really means to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	A very dangerous aspect of Ken Wilber's work -- which I feel Daniel has imbibed a lot of -- is the idea that 1st person phenomena and 3rd person phenomena are two equally valid domains. But this is not true. 1st person phenomena is the only real thing. All 3rd person phenomena is pure illusion, and I don't see Daniel recognizing that. There is still too much attachment to science in him. He does not understand how deeply wrong the science paradigm is. It's utterly, foundationally wrong to the point of not being fixable. You cannot use science to understand the core of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Something like evolution does not even exist. It's just a figment of his imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Idealism is not a mirror to materialism. Both these guys are profoundly misunderstanding idealism, nonduality, and spirituality. Materialism is hallucinated by Infinite Consciousness. This point is so simple and clear. There is no doubt about it whatsoever. Classic problem here of "So smart he's dumb". This is why I tell people to do psychedelics because you won't get it otherwise. Your consciousness will not allow you to get it no matter how smart you are.
</p>

<p>
	But I still admire his intellect. If you want to learn how to think clearly, he's a great role-model.
</p>

	Well, you need to open your mind to the possibility of accessing raw, absolute truth unmediated by any interprations or perceptions or science or anything.

<p>

	Love and Truth is everything that every could be experienced. But bliss is like a feeling. It comes and goes. Most of your life will not be spent in feelings of bliss. Even if you are being tortured it is Truth/Love, but not bliss.

<p>
	Talking about looks is pointless because you got whatever looks you got.
</p>

<p>
	Move on to attracting girls.
</p>

<p>
	Keep it simple. Don't let your mind distract you with pointless bullshit. You can whine about looks for years and just waste your time not getting laid.

<p>
	Be careful though. Daniel's view of reality is still missing the highest understanding. It's sorta trapped in all that stage Yellow logic.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to reach God/Love through all that systemic thinking and jargon.
</p>

<p>
	So it's great stuff, but still limited.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, "the better the model the bigger the problem."
</p>

<p>
	The truth is that there is no world to save from collapse. All that is just a game his mind made up to keep him distracted from realizing he is God.

	It can be good, but it's also jargony. Laymen will not be able to follow it. I can follow it but it takes effort. Which means most people will be lost. You have to read like 200 books to know what he's talking about.

	Who the fuck knows what a strange attractor is? Like 1% of people. It's a powerful concept but you gotta read a book on chaos theory to understand it.

			Bentinho describes this painfully intense Universal Bliss that he felt during his last DMT trip, just like Leo described in his last blog update. And he goes on to say that he doesn't want that, because it's not Him, but a construct. And the reason that it's painful is because it is false.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	False? Lol. That's nonsense. It's Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	But you miss the point. It's not about the bliss. You're not chasing that bliss, you're simply becoming conscious of Absolute Truth and the bliss is just a side-effect of that.
</p>

<p>
	When you are infinitely conscious it's just natural that bliss occurs.
</p>

<p>
	I never do psychedelics for the purpose of pleasure. But if pleasure comes, I won't say no.
</p>

<p>
	Him is the construct. Infinite Consciousness/Love is the true "him". It's just that he needs to peddle human bullshit to his followers. Bentinho can't tell his followers that they will never reach Infinite Consciousness without DMT or they would leave him.
</p>

<p>
	You will NEVER reach DMT levels of consciousnesses through self-inquiry or meditation. That is the truth. What these self-inquiry people are teaching you is something far less than that because they don't know how to get you access to DMT levels of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are not about bliss, they are about increasing one's consciousness. That he doesn't get this is sad.

<p>
	Of course there can still be material consequences, like going to jail.
</p>

<p>
	But the internal consequences are less when one isn't aware that one is doing anything wrong.
</p>

<p>
	There is a karmic difference between stealing while knowing that you're stealing vs stealing without knowing that you're stealing.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why most theft is done by people who have managed to fool themselves into thinking they are not stealing at all.

			Could you please give me an example of the kind of subtle manipulation and assertion that you're talking about that real assholes who totally don't care about a girl's feelings do?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	For example, you meet a girl at the club, it's late at night. She tells you she has to work tomorrow. If you were empathetic and concerned about her well-being you would let her go home. But the typical PUA will ignore all that and just manipulate her into going back home with him anyway, causing her to be late for work. He will try to boost up her state and seduce her such that she forgets about work and sleeps with him.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that you can accomplish more when you don't have to take into account the well-being or agenda of others.
</p>

<p>
	See, the more conscious you become, the less you can get away with shit like that because it harms your own consciousness and integrity.
</p>

<p>
	The cruel thing about consciousness is that the more conscious you become the more responsible you must be for the well-being of others, otherwise you create bad karma for yourself. So an unconscious PUA can rape a girl and not experience bad karma, but a conscious person cannot. That's the cost of consciousness. The closer you get to infinite consciousness the less evil you can be. There is a direct trade-off between selfishness and consciousness. Such that when you reach infinite consciousness you must literally cease to physically exist. Because even your physical existence is too selfish to hold infinite consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There is no one to read when you are fully conscious. Yes, you see through everything and everyone all at once. No more questions remain about anything because you are perfectly omniscient. But this omniscience cannot be put into any human words or thoughts and it is utterly baffling, yet also perfectly obvious.

<p>
	Imagine so much pleasure that you want to kill yourself because you cannot hold it because it's too much to hold.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine me slowly pulling out all your teeth with rusty pliers, but you feel pleasure instead of pain. The pleasure is so intense that it literally dissolves your human existence. It melts you down into a puddle on the floor. Like an infinite orgasm that lasts for eternity.

<p>
	There are no videos where I explain it.
</p>

<p>
	It's too profound to explain. You will require a TOTAL God-realization awakening. Took me 100+ awakenings to reach it.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is literally, Absolute Perfection. So it's perfect in every possible way, including the efficiency of its design. The fundamental question is, what is the best way to design reality? And the answer turns out to be: to make everything an illusion of your own making. This is the ultimate genius.

	Society advances one dead mentally-sclerotic Boomer at a time.

<p>
	Tragic, but also necessary.

<p>
	It certainly might. But western nations have no obligation to support Iraq endlessly. In the end you guys gotta govern yourselves. And if you can't, then you will devolve to whatever level of governance your level of collective development can support. Iraq is not really developed enough to sustain a democracy. So it's like digging a hole in the middle of the ocean.

<p>
	It probably is good, but the US has limited resources too. We have already spent trillions on Iraq and there is little appetite left for more.
</p>

<p>
	No amount of money in the world can raise Iraq from stage Purple/Red to Orange within a few years. That will require a century of hard development work.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I would focus more on things that are within your control, like your own development. Dwelling on this negative political stuff is robbing you of precious mental energy.

<p>
	It's always gonna be an almost impossible situation because you cannot force someone to grow. They have to do it at their own pace.
</p>

<p>
	Slowly you can introduce ideas and things from the higher stages to her, but there's no guarantee it will stick, and you shouldn't really expect anyone to grow to Yellow or above because it's statistically very rare.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are lost causes. Or rather, they will only grow at a snail's pace. It takes about 5 years to grow up by 1 level, and that assumes the person is eagerly and actively doing personal development. Most relationships don't last that long.

But then you have to act on it.
</p>

<p>
	As an autistic guy, your problem is gonna be too much theory and too little action.
</p>

<p>
	Basically all you gotta do is go out, be social, be playful with girls, and close. Too much theory beyond that will only get you too stuck in your head. You won't be able to execute it in front of the girl.

<title>Why are the men on this forum so addicted to attracting women?</title>

<p>
	Do not keep creating these gender war debates.
</p>

<p>
	Men have a different agenda than you. The end. If you want to talk about how to create deep relationships as part of your personal development, go ahead. But don't debate how men should drop their agenda for you. Attraction advice is not designed for you women, it's designed for men to solve their problems. Since you don't have their problems the advice falls on deaf ears. Really, the solution here is that women should not listen to attraction advice for men. You should be listening to advice designed to improve your love life, not a man's -- because you're not a man.
</p>

<p>
	It would be like if walked into a women's dressing room and started complaining that you ladies spend too much time on makeup. Stop wearing makeup and stop talking about makeup because it offends me when you do so.
</p>

	"Not really into dumb BS small talk"  << You've just excluded 98% of women, Lol

<p>
	Remove that line. It makes you sound too serious and business-like -- and even a bit butt-hurt.

<p>
	Don't compliment. Don't place yourself in a lower position than her, like you do with your boots comment. Your boots comment makes it sounds like you're afraid of her boots crushing you. This sets the opposite frame of what you want.
</p>

<p>
	Also don't invest yourself into these matches. Shoot a text and move on. You invest too much into them. You need higher volume and less investment.

<p>
	Do not be sexual.
</p>

<p>
	If the girl truly likes you, you don't need to game her much. The problem is they don't really like you to begin with, otherwise they would be receptive to a simple "Hey there".
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind there is a lot of fake profiles and girls just looking for validation and ego-boosts on apps like Tinder.
</p>

<p>
	Girls are not above using guys purely for validation with no intention of fucking them.
</p>

<p>
	Your best opener is gonna be a short unique funny line.
</p>

<p>
	Counter-intuitively yes. Lot of pickup actually teaches you how to be more expressive like a girl. To flow more with your feelings. Most guys are so stuck in their heads they are disconnected from their feelings. Feelings are not just feminine, they are also masculine.
</p>

<p>
	You will attract way more girls by being emotionally expressive than you will by being stoic.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to how you talk to children or dogs. You adopt an over-emotionalized, playful attitude. You don't treat the interaction seriously. Likewise when attracting women. Treat women like children when trying to flirt with them.
</p>

<p>
	Watch videos of men flirting with women.
</p>

			What you guys have said is very much true. So, then So, then why aren't nerds or other guys who are on the Autism spectrum not successful with women, even though those with autism exhibit masculine traits such as lack of expressed empathy towards others, pre-occupation with success, arrogance, and disregard for all social norms?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Autism is an over-abundance of logic. The worst think you can do to attract women is to be logical.
</p>

<p>
	The formula for being attractive to women is to be illogical, brash, confident, emotional, charismatic, playful, and socially attuned. Autistic people suck at this.
</p>

<p>
	You can be socially attuned without yet still narcissistic and breaking certain conventions selectively.
</p>

<p>
	You need to break social conventions in a cool, clued-in way, rather than a clueless, uncool, awkward, nerdy, creepy way.
</p>

<p>
	Think of the wild rockstar vs the awkward geek.
</p>

<p>
	Autistic people are too serious, and this kills your ability to attract women. Playfulness is key.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at Arnold Schwarzenegger, he is very playful, emotional, and socially attuned, but he can also kick your ass and be stoic. It's a special blend:

<p>
	Yes, well, there is always an inverse relationship between being powerful and being loved. It's hard to have both. The more points you allocate into selfishness the less people will like you, but the better your survival odds. The more points you allocate into selflessness, the more people will love you, but at the cost of your survival.

	In practice, masculinity is HIGHLY valued and respected and rewarded by society. Just don't go so toxic with it that you piss off a horde of SJWs. In practice, as a man, you can get away with some much that it's actually shocking if you try it. In most cases you actually can get away with grabbing women by the pussy. I just don't recommend doing that unless you're sure she wants you to.

<p>
	Society massively rewards aggressive, dickish, and downright sociopathic behavior in men. The world's richest and most powerful men are basically sociopaths and narcissists and they get the most and best vagina. And it has always been this way.
</p>

<p>
	But of course such men disregard all social norms and SJW narratives. They often disregard laws too.
</p>

<p>
	The reason why women are attracted to dickish behavior is because it's ruthlessly effective for survival. The woman needs a dick on her side precisely so she can be kind and sweet and innocent. She is like a king controlling an army of pawns to fight on his behalf while keeping his hands clean.

<p>
	They get objectified by society to please men. Women constantly have to feel bad for not meeting society's unrealistic beauty standards.
</p>

<p>
	You only get those extra points if you are exceptionally beautiful, which like 10% of women are. The rest are not.
</p>

<p>
	How would you feel if society gave you extra points, but only if your dick was 10 inch or longer? Otherwise you'd be made to feel like trash? And we would re-measure your dick every time you left the house.
</p>

<p>
	Time is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Like in a novel, there is no time. The sense of time is projected into the story. You can write a novel and set it in any period. Likewise Consciousness can dream up any period. Consciousness is not bound by time since it imagines it in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	Every period in history, Consciousness imagines.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the medival times did not happen long ago. They are imagined to have happened.
</p>

<p>
	Women's survival is already threatened in many ways that you are too naive and self-biased to comprehend.
</p>

<p>
	Sweet and nice women are used and abused all the time, and have been for thousands of years. But you wouln't care anything about that, would you?

<p>
	Of course survival is always hypocritical.
</p>

<p>
	Survival for me but not for thee. I gain value, you lose value. That's the game of survival.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You definitely have to ignore certain narratives and build yourself into a strong man.
</p>

<p>
	There is a narrative that makes men meek if they adhere to it too closely. It is a fine balancing act. Don't treat women too nicely. But also don't abuse, control, or oppress them.
</p>

<p>
	Be masculine without being toxicly masculine.

	Do women mature in their selection of men with age? Sure. They get wiser. So do men. But a big pair of tits will still be attractive.

<p>
	Of course. Just like guys reward hot tits more than human decency.
</p>

<p>
	Human decency is not rewarded much. Which is why it's rare.
</p>

<p>
	If you want decency, look for it in the monastery, not the sexual marketplace.

<p>
	Reagan popularized and solidified the libertarian free-market capitalist lunacy which has been slowly eating away at the foundations of a healthy American government for the last 40 years.
</p>

<p>
	Reagan's attitude had a very corrosive influence on government and arguably led to many of the systemic issues we face today.
</p>

<p>
	Not mention the racist War On Drugs.
