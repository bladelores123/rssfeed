<p>
	What is the thing you're trying to survive? Does it even exist?
</p>

<p>
	What would you call it if an insane man devoted his whole life to protecting his imaginary wife?

			Now all living beings are directly God so if God plans a beautiful story with no coincidences, how is the human (who is God). Being able to act independently.

<p>
	You are thinking about this in far too limited a manner. You're using dualistic logic to try to figure this out, and that will never work.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a fixed story like a movie. It is an interactive story which is always in the process of being written, like a video game. The designers of a video game set very tight constraints, yet you as the player are still given a lot of freedom, so much so that even the designers cannot predict what you will do next.
</p>

<p>
	Even humans are capable enough of creating a video game which gives players agency, yet you think God is such a fool that all he could do was sit down and write out your entire life story?
</p>

<p>
	It's way more subtle and intelligent than that. Stop taking God for a moron.

</p>

<p>
	To understand the validity of a mathematical proof requires insight. Exactly the same kind of insight as enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you apply insight in the relative domain does not mean it is different in the absolute domain. Insight is a general function of consciousness. It can be used in all sorts of ways, from the mundane to the divine.
</p>

<p>
	You can have a valid insight into how to boil an egg. Of course that insight is relative to you being a human in a physical world where there exist eggs. If you enter some 5 dimensional astral realm, boiling eggs may no longer work.
</p>

<title>If Muhammad was enlightened then why is Islam dogmatic?</title>

<p>
	Stage Red & Blue spirituality is dogmatic and authoritarian.
</p>

<p>
	You need to seriously take into account historical context. The notion of being non-dogmatic did not even exist 1500 years ago in Arabia.
</p>

<p>
	And my guess is that Muhammad himself was not deeply enlightened. Rather he was good at channeling.
</p>

<p>
	And then of course you have to distinguish between Muhammad himself and his followers. Even if Muhammad was the shit, most of the people following him were dogmatic and they corrupted his teachings.
</p>

<p>
	It's not different than Christianity and all other religions.
</p>

If God were a human would he really be cool with 50,000 people dying every year simply because they cannot afford overpriced health care in the US? Just so rich corporations could maximize their profits?
</p>

<p>
	Greed and fear create this kind of politics. A politics based on love would be more empathetic and giving.

<p>
	The problem is one of doubt. Unless you have direct consciousness of God you will doubt it because it's too amazing to believe.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you did believe it, it wouldn't help much because it is not part of your living experience. It'd just a story some guy told you.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between being told about orgasm and actually having one.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is solved the moment you experience yourself as God. Awakening is the solution.

<p>
	You fear profile is gonna depend on an infinitely long chain of causation like your genetics, your personality type, the environment you were raised in, stuff that happened to you, thoughts you think, your goals and desires, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Remember fear is a survival mechanic. It was necessary to keep you alive as your limited human self. Fear is the cost of staying alive as a finite being. So in this sense it's hard to avoid. This is the whole challange of becoming infinite.

	Quantum and chemicals are forms within consciousness. You cannot ever get underneath consciousness because it is the only thing there is.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the TV screen. Everything else is content displayed on the screen. Don't confuse content for the screen itself.

<p>
	All things are connected by being ONE rather than two.

<p>
	Notice how your mind keep creating differences between things. That's duality. You keep dreaming up differences and getting lost in them.

<p>
	There is no difference between reality and illusion unless you imagine there is.

<p>
	There was no strain at all (except for the writing hand). It was comfortable and enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
	There is little ego backlash these days. It's no big deal at this point. As the mind becomes more pure there are less and less problems over all and the trips are always positive and healing.

<p>
	It wasn't really a voice, it was pure Infinite Intelligence expressing itself through me. It was totally direct. There was no sense of "other". I was simply speaking to myself, since there is in fact no other possibility. I was too conscious for there to be someone other than me in the room.
</p>

<p>
	It's really no different than solving a geometric proof. Who are you asking if the proof is true? You! The truth of the proof is seen by the intelligence of your own mind. So it's just like mathematics, but deeper.
</p>

<p>
	Do you talk to God when you do mathematics? Think about that. How do you know 5x5=25? By who's authority? Does a voice tell you it is true?

<p>
	It sounds exactly like you, since you are it.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Intelligence has no form whatsoever. Yet it manifests itself through all form. It's tricky that way. Any time the Godhead tries to manifest itself, dumb humans confuse that form with what it is. So if it comes to you looking like Jesus, you start to imagine that God looks like Jesus. But God doesn't look or sound like anything. It is you!

			Which profession is closer to the highest manifestation of love? Being an artist maybe? Or your profession doesn't matter at all? What is the relationship between self actualization and love?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is an infinite number of ways to manifest Love. So I wouldn't limit it to any one profession. The whole point of Love is that is literally Infinite! Everything is a manifestation of Love.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, the ultimate profession is becoming a mystic/Bodhisattva because only a hardcore mystic will ever fully realize what Love is. Ordinary people, including artists, just aren't conscious enough to realize how deep Love goes. They also aren't selfless and pure enough to manifest Love in it purest form. Their bodies and minds are too corrupted by ego, culture, and defilements. So their work is nice, but it pales in comparison to the work of someone like Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	To manifest love at the highest levels you must become conscious of what Love truly is, and then you must completely rid yourself of yourself (see quote in my sig). And then whatever you do after that doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
	This is usually only achieved by full-time monks and mystics. And even then it's rare. It's not easy for a human to perfectly reflect God. You'd basically have to surrender your entire life to do it. Which is why it's so rarely done and awesome.
</p>

<p>
	If you really care about Love, devote your life to the way of the Bodhisattva and you won't regret it. And make sure you do some 5-MeO-DMT along the way.
</p>

	Read the Stanford article on idealism. It's explained there.
</p>

<p>
	Epistemtic idealism means that human knowledge is a construction of the mind. Ontological idealism means that physical reality is a construction of the mind.

<p>
	Hume is nice for starting philosophy but ultimately he's wrong in many foundational ways.
</p>

<p>
	Heraclitus is good but there's so little of him to read. It's just a handful of lines.
</p>

<p>
	Epictetus is great
</p>

<p>
	Heidegger is too confusing for me to bother with. It's not ultimately true enough.

<p>
	Kant is an epistemic idealist. He doesn't go far enough. What he's missing is ontological idealism.
</p>

<p>
	You're better off just reading summaries of such philosopher's work on Standard Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Otherwise you'll waste years read dense books which only make you more confused than you began.

<p>
	That's the whole problem of communication and abstract philosophical work. It's often impossible to really understand.
</p>

<p>
	Some philosophical writing is abstract that there is literally not enough information in the book to clearly know when it meant.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I shower you guys with so many examples. It's only from lots of examples can you understand the abstractions.
</p>

<p>
	Honestly, Kant is not worth your time to read. Kant is not nearly a profound as people make him out to be. Various distinctions he makes are confused and deluded.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to read some good Western philosophy, try Plotinus or Berkeley.

<p>
	Of course there are a billion traps to maximizing love. That is what all of evolution is doing, and you think us humans can write it out in some kind of bulleted list?
</p>

<p>
	To understand how to maximize love best you must learn to tap into God Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And even then it will be messy and full of traps.

<p>
	The way you frame this is already a big problem.
</p>

<p>
	This distinction you make between mindset problems and actual problems is itself a mindset problem!
</p>

<p>
	What if all problems were nothing but your mindset towards them? Contemplate the significance of that.

</p>

<p>
	But it's not the only factor. There are other aspects of development, like how much emotional baggage and trauma is stored in your body.

	Depends on how you do it. If you smoke massive doses, sure.
</p>

<p>
	But if you plug moderate doses, then no.
</p>

<p>
	And if you do it properly it can actually be healing.

			Seems like a lot of you guys are doing these powerful psychedelics extremely often, do you believe in an integration period? Is there benefit to doing it so often? Like from my understanding 5 meo is the most intense experience the human psyche can undergo, is it just like that on the regular after repeated use? I mean if you are doing the most profound experience you could possibly imagine on a weekly or monthly basis, what is the rush to jump back in so quickly besides escaping your baseline mind state? This is not a criticism, am just curious 
		</p>

<p>
	It's all relative.
</p>

<p>
	There have been times where I did it only once a year. And there have been times where I did 13 days in a row.
</p>

<p>
	The more advanced you get the more often you can do it without needing a lot of integration time.
</p>

<p>
	They key is to be intuitive about. Don't get set any rigid or dogmatic schedule. Do it as you're called to do it. Sometimes you will not be called for months. And sometimes you'll be called to hit it hard several days back to back.
</p>

<p>
	The most I grew in my life was from 13 back to back days. Words cannot describe the levels of superhuman insight gained. The entire universe became known to me. I had to really force myself to do it back to back 13 times. Your mind won't want to do it that much. Most people would feel like they've gone insane. It requires a really good theoretical foundation in nonduality.

<title>Any other Tarot Readers Here?</title>

<p>
	A friend of mine once did a Tarot reading of me.
</p>

<p>
	It was surprising good.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that it predicts your future, but rather is works by getting your own mind to clarify its own desires and obstacles.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like an occult form of life coaching, where the answers don't come from the coach but from the mind of the person being coached.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make regarding Tarot is thinking of it as some fortune telling device. It's not that.

<p>
	You are very naive about how corporations do business & about white collar crime.
</p>

<p>
	The entire political system is deliberately designed to redistribute wealth upwards to the most powerful. There is nothing arbitrary about it. That is right-wing trickle down economics.
</p>

<p>
	Weakening the government by going the "limited government" route will only make this problem worse.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be a limited government when greater levels of social organization require massively complex management systems. You cannot have all of today's modern technological luxuries while also organizing government via caveman politics.
</p>

<p>
	With caveman government you get caveman lifestyle.

	Spirituality is about facing your fears and realizing that all fear is illusion.

<p>
	The whole function of life is learn how to love vs fear. That is really the only thing you're doing here in life. Everything is just a variation on this theme. Take a look.

<p>
	Your views of how government and capitalism work are very naive.
</p>

<p>
	Capitalism IS a redistribution of resources to giant corporations and the most powerful and manipulative people, which undermines democracy. Social democracy is a check on that redistribution of wealth to elites. Elites use capitalism to extract massive amounts of wealth from the rest of society regardless of the damage it causes.
</p>

<p>
	Democracy + capitalism is a contradiction. There is no such thing. If you have capitalism you have anti-democracy because money buys all politicians. This leads to corporatism, plutocracy, and corruption. Corruption is not a function of evil people doing bad things, it's a function of money infecting the democratic process in a systemic way.
</p>

<p>
	The Kochtopus is still thriving. It goes way beyond any one individual. It's an ideology and a super-organism that takes on a life of its own.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to The Family Netflix documentary. Just because Doug Kho is dead, doesn't mean The Family isn't a big problem in politics.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise with Trumpism. Trumpism will be a problem even after Trump leaves office because it is a larger ideological force.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about attacking Trump, it's about making people aware of the larger systemic forces and self-deceptions at work which lead to devils like Trump and Koch bros to thrive.

<p>
	You misunderstand Osho. I see people here quoting spiritual masters in such twisted ways, where you end up doing the every opposite of what they teach.

<p>
	It makes sense to you because it is music to a devil's ears. A devil loves nothing more than to hear a great teacher give him permission to be a devil.

			I don't know about America but where I live, tap water is meant to be drinkable. "mineral" water from the grocery store often is less mineralized than tap water and is extremely overpriced.

<p>
	If you drink tap water, you're a fool. You think it's free of heavy metals & other junk? Ha!
</p>

<p>
	Imagine filling your brain with trace heavy metals for 40 years. Don't be surprised when your health goes to hell.

</p>

<p>
	You see the deeper problem here? Your approach is so hopelessly indirect.
</p>

<p>
	God is sitting right here! Yet you turn to some 2000 year old book written by we know not who.
</p>

<p>
	It is as though you are in the middle of having sex, you stop, and you ask your partner to watch some porn with you instead because you want to know what sex is.
</p>

<p>
	The key to spirituality is directness. The enemy of spirituality is indirectness. Cut out all the middlemen. They cannot truly help you.

<p>
	I use the term liberal to distinguish from conservative. In this context liberal = leftist.

	His anarchism is foolish, BTW. The rest of his ideas are pretty good.

<p>
	We cannot solve serious global problems via anarchism. Nor can anarchists prevent the formation of higher holons of social organization. This is a childish non-solution. Anarchism doesn't work at the scale of 100s of millions of people. Anarchists have no solutions for controling nuclear weapons, not to mention a thousand other things.

	Slavoj Zizek has some good critiques of this anarchist fantasy:

<p>
	It's not about stopping enjoying it. It's about finding a higher purpose in your life, something that you find more meaningful.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to stop enjoying porn.
</p>

<p>
	And there's nothing wrong with enjoying porn either. Porn is just part of the beauty of reality. Be grateful it exists.

<p>
	It means you imagine it.
</p>

<p>
	It exists only because you create it. If you stop creating it, it will stop existing.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a matter of belief. It is a matter of becoming conscious of how you are creating it.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you are not yet conscious of how you are creating your own brith. You have confused the idea of your birth for some real event outside your own mind. It doesn't even occur to you that your birth could be imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, you are basically insane, imagining stuff like a psychotic. The most importing thing you are imagining is that you are not imagining but that its all real.

<p>
	That's precisely the kind of attitude that a devil will exploit to his advantage.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that a devil doesn't play fair. That's what makes him a devil. If you give him the benefit of the doubt, he will exploit it. Which is why once some proves himself to be a pathological liar, narcissist, or con artist you should never take him seriously again. The way a con artist works is precisely by conning you and then repenting and exploiting your soft heart to con you a second and third time.
</p>

<p>
	Trump behave exactly in this matter. Which is why nothing that comes out of his mouth can ever be given the benefit of the doubt. Given his past history, everything that comes out of his mouth should be considered a lie unless proven otherwise. That is how you properly deal with a con artist. You don't trust him ever again.

<p>
	Just because you have a mentally ill friend doesn't mean you platform him to your viewers. It's irresponsible to platform such a person to millions of viewers as though it's all just in good fun.
</p>

<p>
	It's like yeah, I'm good friends with Hitler, so let me give him my platform.

<p>
	What we really need long-term is a new transformative technology that will either: 1) remove carbon from the atmosphere, and/or, 2) block sunlight from reaching the Earth in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	I envision a sort of giant thin film set up in space which simply blocks sunlight from reaching the planet like sun glasses. With such a technology we would not only eliminate global warming forever but we could actively regulate the temperate on the planet to maximize consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But something like this needs to be funded by big government research.
</p>

<p>
	It's quite obvious that advanced civilizations learn to regulate the climate on their planet.
</p>

<p>
	As a species it's like we're living in the age before air conditioning.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being able to selectively regulate the sunlight in desert regions like the Sahara or the Gobi, making it lush and livable!
</p>

<p>
	We could even install a UV filter so people don't get sunburned.
</p>

<title>Advice on contemplation</title>

<p>
	If you are prone to depression then contemplation could be problematic in the sense that you will get lost inside your own mind. You have to careful here to balance between theory & practice. For a depressed person going to the gym might be more effective to change one's mood than contemplating on the couch about one's mood.
</p>

<p>
	But it the long run you should build yourself up to the point where you can contemplate things without it driving you deeper into depression. As you become more developed and conscious it will be easier for you to let go of being stuck in your own mind. Kriya yoga & meditation helps a lot with this.
</p>

<p>
	If all you do is sit and think (without any yoga or meditation practice) you will end up getting lost in your own mind. And this will create various kinds of dysfunction.
</p>

<p>
	So watch out! The mind can be a very dangerous thing. Then again, being mindless can be even more dangerous.
</p>

	JP is actually a smart guy with some good insight into psychology and human nature.
</p>

<p>
	But his politics suck.
</p>

<p>
	There are two very distinct sides to JP: his academic side and his political side. The problem is he mixes them so it's like he prepares you a fine gourmet meal, but with a turd on top.

	Oh there will be major backlash if Bernie get elected. The corporatists will start flinging shit like never before.
</p>

<p>
	See, we've never seen the corporate elite truly get their feet held to the fire the way Bernie would do.
</p>

<p>
	Big industries like oil and gas, coal, pharma, health insurance, Wall Street, banking, etc. will be in an uproar and will invest billions in ads to manipulate their way back into power.
</p>

<p>
	Billions will pour into the Fox News propaganda machine. It will be get real nasty. They will do everything possible to take Bernie down. Because this hits them right at the heart of their survival agenda: money!
</p>

<p>
	The health insurance industry will fight to the bitter end like a cornered animal because if Bernie get his way, they're dead overnight. They have nothing to lose. They will go down swinging.

<p>
	You're missing the deeper mindfuck here: there are no such things are rocks because a rock does not know it is a rock. You project that "rock" onto the world in the same way you project your own ego.
</p>

<p>
	A rock doesn't really have an age because who is to say what counts as rock vs not-rock? Only your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The true age of the rock is identical to that of your body because they are indistinguishable. Both are Eternal until you project time onto the sitution.

<p>
	Distinction = difference = form = duality
</p>

<p>
	So you are asking, What is difference?
</p>

<p>
	If reality is made out of differences, then what is a difference made out of?
</p>

<p>
	Notice you get a paradox here because if you say, Difference is made out of nothing. That nothing is still a difference. This question cannot be answered at the level of langauge. An awakening is required. You must somehow jump out of the domain of language altogether because all that language is are differences, so you can't use language to understand difference itself. Creating more differences is not the same thing as groking what difference is.

	Most people are not interested in being aware of it because you'd be undermining their very way of life!

<p>
	Self-deception is a VAST topic with many sub-topics. It's the bulk of how humans fool themselves into believing they are human.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that this stuff cannot simply be taught or explained, it requires deep self-reflection, contemplation, and consciousness work -- which virtually nobody is willing to do.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you do it, you'll still get tripped up in self-deception. Self-deception does not joke around. It's seriously deceptive.

	Bernie is more left than Warren obviously.
</p>

<p>
	I prefer to elect the highest leader possible and let the chips fall where they may. The system will deal with it. Gradualism has been tried with Obama and it failed. Another 8 years of someone like Obama is going to make things even worse. The system needs some serious change of the status quo.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie is not a Green version of Trump. Trump is a moronic lying narcissist. Bernie is an intelligent, honest, compassionate leader.
</p>

<p>
	A Green version of Trump would be 20 year old Green Peace activist with bipolar disorder who wants to jail people for eating fish and force children to eat soy, who faces a criminal case for sabotaging factory farms.

	To say that it's such a complex problem that we don't know what to do is absurd. We can start by banning oil companies from paying politicians to lie about climate change. These oil companies have known about climate change (internally) for 50 years!

<p>
	Carbon Tax! There's your answer. But JP is lost in philosophical right-wing distractions.

<p>
	To maintain his anti-SJW position he has to make it seem like climate activism is somehow foolish when it is actually the most obvious thing. What's foolish is criticizing people who care about the environment.

	Bernie has already shifted the Overton window to the left.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks to Bernie the democratic party is much more progressive. Free Healthcare is now supported by many democrats.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing is not policy per se but the changing in collective worldview.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing is not to free the slaves but to get people to realize that slavery is not right. Once people realize that slavery is not right, the freeing of the slaves will be inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	Moscow Mitch can certainly win in the short term, but not in the long term because he is clearly on the wrong side of history. Because consciousness is always evolving to higher levels. Moscow Mitch can dig his heels in all he wants, but he will eventually lose that battle. Such obvious self-bias will not be sustainable.

<p>
	If the mind is deeply stilled a nondual state of consciousness will eventually set in, because duality is created by an active mind.
</p>

<p>
	But merely 5 minutes of stillness will not be enough. You need long periods of stillness over many days, weeks, months, years. It can't just be a temporary stillness, the mind actually has to rewire itself to be less active by default.
</p>

<p>
	From stillness insight can arise. This insight leads to enlightenment.
