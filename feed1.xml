			Leo what would you say to someone who's afraid to awaken for the first time? It seems like you would freak out from all of the realizations hitting you at once. Simultaneously realizing you're God/Everything, you were never born, your family isn't real, and that there isn't even a me sounds like a little much to take in lol. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It will not happen all at once. It will take you years to realize all those facets.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to overcome fear of awakening is via a psychedelic. It's not so hard. You will learn to enjoy ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	There's honestly nothing to fear but fear itself.

<p>
	Well, protection of ego is a very important function. That encompasses all of survival. Do not ignore how utterly important ego is for keeping an organism alive.
</p>

<p>
	What I am saying is not simplistic at all. It's infinitely complex.
</p>

<p>
	I am not really rejecting the right-wing. All of it is absolutely imporant and it could not be otherwise. The devil must be embraced in love, not demonized.

<p>
	I am just saying the devil is ignorant and deluded. This is not a judgment. This is just truth.

<p>
	No, that is not what I said. I said that you must look at the low vs high axis rather than the right vs left axis.
</p>

<p>
	You are looking at the wrong axis. Forget for a moment that the right vs left axis even exists. Focus on the low vs high axis.
</p>

<p>
	The key question is: how conscious are you? How universal is your identity?
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious that you are Hitler? No? Then you're not very conscious and your politics will reflect this disowned shadow of yours.

</blockquote>

<p>
	We don't have to guess. There are many Jesus-level mystics alive on the planet right now. You can meet them face to face.
</p>

<p>
	People would consider most of them "radical left-wingers."
</p>

<p>
	The issue is complicated somewhat by the fact that one can be deeply enlightened but still not highly developed on the Spiral. Many Eastern mystics are stage Blue. They will be more conservative. But anyone at stage Green or higher will appear very liberal.
</p>

<p>
	Conservative vs liberal is a totally relative designation. It all depends on what you're using as your benchmark. Compared to Jews from 2000 years ago, Ben Shapiro and Fox News is a terrible example of liberalism.
</p>

<p>
	Killing and eating is also you. And every lifeform must kill other lifeforms.
</p>

<p>
	This is what you need to learn to love. This is the real test of your capacity to love. Can you love evil? If not, your love is weak and egoic.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how conveniently you ignore how many lifeforms you kill to sustain yourself.

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The bias of a mystic is Truth, Goodness, Love, Consciousness, and Harmony.
</p>

<p>
	This does not square well with right-wing or conservative politics because the primary appeal of conservativism is ego and closedmindedness.
</p>

<p>
	You never heard of Jesus flipping over the money-lender's table? That was a very political act against the corrupt status quo. For this he was eventually crucified.
</p>

<p>
	Truth and Love upsets the political establishment very much, because it is always run by devils. Devils seek power and money. Mystics seek Truth and Love.
</p>

<p>
	See, the devil hates it when a mystic points him out as a devil. Because a devil can only stay a devil when he has other people and himself confused. But a mystic sees right through a devil because he is the Truth. So the mystic is the highest threat to devils. So the devil's #1 priority is to silence, demonize, and kill the highest mystics. The devil does all this without knowing he is doing it. Because if he knew, he could not do it.
</p>

<p>
	All I'm doing is pointing out devilry to devils. To a devil this might look like a "left-wing bias".
</p>

<p>
	More broadly-speaking, do I have opinions and biases? Of course. Every mind does. That's not the issue. The issue is, how conscious are you of your mind's biases? Are you aware of how selfish your mind is? Are you aware that your entire reasoning faculty has been hijacked by ego?
</p>

<p>
	See, what I'm talking about is not a matter of left or right, it is a meta matter. It is a matter of one's altitude of perspective. You should not be so much concerned with left vs right as high vs low.
</p>

<p>
	Very practically speaking, as you move into Spiral stages Green, Yellow, Turquoise and beyond you will appear to others as much more liberal/left-wing. This is a relative matter. It appears this way simply because high stages of development are very rare and society/culture/politics is dominated by the much lower stages of Red/Blue/Orange. These low stages are extremely mypoic, selfish, reactive, and closeminded. Almost at animal like levels.
</p>

<p>
	Visionary, cutting-edge perspectives appear radical to ordinary folks. This has always been the case. Amongst a horde of slave-owners, someone questioning slavery looks very "left-wing." The slave-owners will have no choice but to demonize the person questioning slavery because it is a direct threat to their survival.
</p>

<title>Questions on identity</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/33948-questions-on-identity/?do=findComment&amp;comment=407740</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	This issue is far deeper than you yet realize.
</p>

<p>
	Your identity as a human is a false one, but you need it to survive in the social domain. So you play various manipulation games, trying to suit your identity to what has social survival value. This makes it impossible to ever be happy about yourself because all these social identities are pure fiction.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate solution is to awaken out of that false identity to your true identity -- as Nothing/God. For this enlightenment is requires.
</p>

<p>
	You can make your current identity more authentic and less pathological and less reactive. This will make your life better. But you will never be fully satisfied with that until you finally awaken to the fact that your true identity is Emptiness and formlessness.
</p>

<p>
	You are literally not anything. Or pure consciousness without any properties or forms. You are also litterally the entire universe. So how could any human identity make you satisfied?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	So you are standing in your own way by your attachment to being human.
</p>

<p>
	All you have to do is die. But that is the last thing you want to do. Hence the struggle. Struggle is part of survival.

<p>
	This is not a hard limit, but it is a reality for millions of people. And people who come from cold climates have corresponding genetics and culture. Cultures and peoples are adapted to different climates and diets.

Go to the gym and observe people's body types. Trust your eyes, not videos or "science".
</p>

<p>
	Observe females too. You can clearly spot female endomorphs vs ectomorphs. Some girls are super skinny and it's not a diet thing. Some girls are beefy. You can clearly see this by watching porn.
</p>

<p>
	Underlying body type is independent of fat or muscle.
</p>

<p>
	You can also see this in animals. Some breeds of dog are naturally very skinny while others are squat. Compare a grey hound to a pitbull.
</p>

<p>
	I am like a grey hound. Joe Rogan is like a pitbull.

	The mistake is expecting a grey hound to be like a pitbull. That mistake is on you, not the grey hound. The grey hound is designed for speed. If you were a careful observer, you would notice the perfection of its design rather than judging it.

<p>
	What you guys are overlooking is that my natural body shape is very tall and lean. Don't compare me to guys like Joe Rogan who are short, squat, and beefy-looking.
</p>

<p>
	To look buff, I would have to add 60 pounds of muscle onto a 6'2" frame. This is not sustainable or healthy for me.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that people have fundamentally different body types (regardless of fat or muscle). There are endomorphs, mesomorphs, and ectomorphs. (And also xenomorphs <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> ) I was always an ectomorph. An ectomorph who happened to be fat due to poor diet.
</p>

<p>
	Muscles do not scale proportionally if your body goes from 5'8" to 6'2". You will become leaner and it will be much harder for you to look buff at 6'2" than at 5'8". Of course there are some tall endomorphs like The Rock. But that ain't me. If you go to the gym and just observe people there, you'll clearly see who is an ectomorph, mesomoroph, endomorph.
</p>

<p>
	Our culture -- especially bro culture which tries to be macho -- devalues ectomorphs while idolizing mesomorphs and endomorphss. But all of these assignments of value is ego.

			My mind tends to be really active in symbols and symbolic imagery, and with the intention of integrating this with my everyday life, I started to wonder what the role of symbols (like the language I am using to get this across to you) is - in the whole network of reality.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is a supremely important question. I encourage you to really contemplate it and research it deeply.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is almost entirely symbolic. But what are symbols? What is language? These are not easy questions to answer but in them lies to key to liberation from the mind.

			LEO, I think you may have a really huge left wing bias.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here is another perspective to consider:
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe it's not about the money but about consciousness and mentality in general? Maybe it's enough of the victim mentality? There are black Americans like Candace Owens who are actually supporting Trump and don't see themselves as victims.  The Democractic Party sure likes to put ideas into the heads of the Black Americans that they are powerless victims, in order to get their votes.
		</p>

		<p>
			Enough is enough of victimhood  - those Black Americans today living in US today are NOT victims.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, I am not a fan of Trump, but I can clearly see how the mainstream media trashed him, and how it backfired on them. To say that he is portrayed accurately by the media is very laughable.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not about playing victim, it's about recognizing systemic inequalities which are de-harmonizing society and creating needless suffering.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just black people who are hurt by it. When people are not treated fairly, they then lash out and we all suffer the consequences collectively.
</p>

<p>
	What I am saying actually requires taking responsibility for the systemic inequalities in our government. It is irresponsible to call people who were economically and racially oppressed for 200 years "victims". That is gaslighting. That's exactly like beating your wife and then telling her, "Oh, stop crying. Stop playing the victim here. It's all just a state of mind. Think positive." That's the definition of devilry.
</p>

<p>
	There are real material inequalities at work here. You're not appreciating the systemic downstream effects of slavery and racism. It doesn't just fix itself in 50 years.
</p>

	It certainly helps, especially when starting out. If only as emotional support and accountability.
</p>

<p>
	Might as well have fun doing it. It tends to be more fun with wings.

Yes, for survival (illusion) cause and effect is great.
</p>

<p>
	But at the level of Absolute Consciousness, cause & effect are a total illusion. This cannot be thought about. You must enter a totally nondual, Absolute state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Cause/effect = duality
</p>

<p>
	If reality is ONE, how can it be caused or be an effect? You must have two parts for cause & effect to be viable. So within duality there is cause & effect but within nonduality there is not.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to phrase it is: cause & effect is relative.
</p>

	He was a con man for most of his life. It's just that power corrupts and makes all personal defects 100x worse.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that Trump has manipulated his media image from the very beginning. His whole public image is a thin lie. He's neither successful, nor powerful, nor a good negotiator, nor a good businessman, etc. It's all bullshit spun by his ego.
</p>

<p>
	Also with age ego can get worse. The devil gets absorbed in his own devilry until he is too far gone. Alex Jones is a good example of this.
</p>

<p>
	I agree that Trump is serving his function for the greater ultimate good, in a twisted sort of way. We need someone to show up how ugly Orange can be.

			The US however, elected Donald Trump. There is a huge part of America, especially rural America that works their asses off for little money and they look down the road and see someone on welfare and the person on welfare is doing quite comparably well as they are. This causes intense hate for welfare and taxes. These people will cause riots before they submit to a socialist system, not understanding that it would benefit them more than just about anyone else. They look at the rich with worship, they dream to be that someday. They buy lottery tickets to entertain the fantasy. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The work that you teach, the work that we are doing is the only solution to this problem. Obama caused a lot of ego backlash. Obama caused Trump.
		</p>

		<p>
			Politics and tax reform needs to come after the hearts of the people have been changed. Giving much attention to politics is putting the cart before the horse right now.

<p>
	Be careful with such stereotypes.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that the majority of Americans voted against Trump! Technically Trump represents a minority of the country. Not only that, but most people voting for Trump were duped by his con game. The media did a really bad job informing voters of Trump's true nature prior to the election. Most people voting for him thought he was a successful business guy at stage Orange, when in fact he is closer to stage Red. America is not that regressive. Most Americans are conscious enough to see that Trump behaves like a devil. Even conservatives see this.
</p>

<p>
	Politics, government, and culture are always evolving. We are in a transition period from Orange to Green. It's going to be a bit rocky but we'll make it. Just because there is ego backlash doesn't mean we give up hope and stop evolving. The ego will always bitching and moaning. We don't let that deter us.
</p>

<p>
	The American political system is very corrupt and does not accurately represent the will of the people. Democracy is being undermined by money and ego. The majority of Americans are for policies like Medicare For All, Free College, ending wars, net neutrality, etc. It's just that corporate interests exert a corrupting influence on elections. In the future this will all change and money in politics will be outlawed.
</p>

<p>
	The hearts of the people are not so bad. It's the corporate influence which is heartless. This is a function of stage Orange materialism running amok. We will grow out it in time. 2020 might be a pivotal election cycle -- the beginning of the end for Orange domination. We'll see.

			One thing about psychedelics is they can take a mind-body into insanity zones. I’ve never wanted to eat or kill people while tripping, yet I’ve been to other insanity zones and that experience has given me a better understanding why people may want to do things that appear to be insane.

<p>
	Right, which shows you the connection between brain chemistry, mind state, and behavior.
</p>

<p>
	What psychedelics reveal is just how many different kinds of states of consciousness there are. Not just a dozen, but millions of radically different states. Various people can be in those various states depending on their brain chemistry, genetics, etc. Some people are stuck in an insane state and that is their reality.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is that some states are far more conducive to awakening and spiritual practice than other states. If your brain is in the right state, waking up is effortlessly easy. Other the other hand, if your brain in the wrong state, nothing you do will wake you up. State is absolutely critical for this work.

<p>
	Yes, this is a huge issue.
</p>

<p>
	What the world needs more than enlightened gurus teaching nonduality is a bridge from where the world is now to a place where folks can just be openminded enough to buy a book about nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I teach a lot of stuff besides strict nonduality.

			Here, let’s say that there is a correlation between race and IQ. That does not mean genetics has anything to do with it. That is an assumption. The correlation could be spurious or there could be an underlying cause. Perhaps genetics, environment or a combination of both.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	If blacks in America received $30 trillion dollars in reparations for slavery (which is just one estimate of the damage done during slavery), the IQ gap would disappear. That's my empirical claim. It could be tested. But of course the whole point is that no one wants to test it. The whole point of the IQ race debate is to deny that blacks are economically abused. The ego wants to blame it on their "inferior genetics", rap music, drugs, sex, black culture, laziness, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The economic unfairness is deliberately overlooked. Because it's too true to admit! It's too much responsibility. What white ego wants to admit that blacks in America incurred $30 trillion dollars worth of abuse? It's too outrageous to admit.
</p>

<p>
	The amazing thing is that blacks have as high an IQ as they do, given the amount of abuse they incurred. A 10 point IQ difference is very small given the historical context and their economic situation.
</p>

<p>
	Hell, one easy way to remove the black IQ gap is to simply change the way we fund public schools. Make all our public schools evenly funded rather than basing the funding off local real estate taxes. This would equalize funding for school in regions with low real estate values. This one change alone could equalize the IQ gap. But no one wants to implement it because it means whites will lose their best schools.
</p>

<p>
	See, blaming genetics is very convenient because then it means we don't have to make any tough policy changes. The ego abuses a victim out of selfishness, then it blame the victim's genetics. This way the ego can feel righteous and superior while it keeps behaving like the selfish devil that it is. The whole purpose of the ego is to prevent honest self-reflection. The devil cannot look himself in the mirror, so he covers up all the mirrors.

	There is some truth to this.

<p>
	But it's important to teach stage Blue & Orange memes in a healthy, non-pathological, non-exclusionary way.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Jordan Peterson teaches these memes but he laces them with his toxic, judgmental, ethnocentric, dualistic shadow -- which then rubs off on his students.

	You must actually sit down and contemplate through these issues to understand how your mind works. Believing me is next to useless. Sit down with a journal and contemplate questions like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is reason?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is evidence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is data?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is interpretation?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is science?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is truth?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is knowledge?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do we know anything?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do I know I can trust my own mind?
	</li>
	<li>
		What if my mind is lying to me?
	</li>
	<li>
		How is my perspective biased?
	</li>
	<li>
		Where did my beliefs come from?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do I believe the things I believe?
	</li>
	<li>
		If I don't know anything, how should I act?
	</li>
	<li>
		etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	See my video: How To Contemplate Using A Journal
</p>

<p>
	All the answers are inside you. But you have to sit down and dig them out.

<p>
	Yes, it definitely does. But I was sensitive to psychedelics even before 5-MeO. 5-MeO just took my sensitivity through the roof.

			No way lol. I don't know if that would be liberating or depressing, sounds like a weird combination of both.. This must mean that all forms of self consciousness are deluded and therefore causing massive amounts of unhappiness for no reason. People are trying to protect and enhance a self that doesn't even exist through the opinions of others who also don't exist. All the behavior that's dictated on the opinions of others must be bullshit, everything must be bullshit.

<p>
	There is good reason for unhappiness and delusion though. It keeps you alive.
</p>

<p>
	If all delusion was removed tomorrow, society would collapse into anarchy and cannibalism.
</p>

<p>
	You can remove delusion within yourself, but doing it across all of society is unworkable at this point in human evolution. Society is like a house of cards held together with snot (delusion). If you insist too much on cleaning up all the snot, it will all fall apart. So the snot must be cleaned up very carefully and gradually to prevent catastrophic collapse.

	That only pushes the question back one step.
</p>

<p>
	The question is, why do most people not want to be?
</p>

<p>
	Want, after all, is not a free thing. Your wants are determined by your genetics, environment, and other factors outside your control.

<p>
	Why do some people want to eat people? Why do some people want to murder people?

<p>
	Every ideological bubble feels self-consistent and "reasonable". As long as you stay inside the bubble and don't go venturing outside.
</p>

<p>
	To create your own reality-bubble all you need to do is exclude, deny, and judge alternative perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	If you notice, Trump is a master at this. He's totally living in his own realty-bubble and you can see how he manipulates himself every day in order to exclude anything that would contradict his bubble. This is extremely dangerous when one has a lot of power.
</p>

<p>
	This is why we make a deep study of epistemology. So that we become self-aware of how our own mind constructs reality-bubbles.

<p>
	What must be deeply understood is that reason serves ego. Reason is NOT a function of truth or facts. Reason is designed to justify whatever serves the ego.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of the alt-right and these genetic IQ debates, a stage Blue/Orange ego is working backwards from its conclusion that European civilization must be superior. (Notice how convenient is it that these egos happen to be European! What a shocker <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> ) So they turn to "science" and "genetics" to solidify that fantasy in their own minds.
</p>

<p>
	That's what all this is really about. It has nothing to do with truth, facts, actual intelligence, or reality.
</p>

<p>
	What all of the alt-right boils down to is identity politics. They are trying to preserve their white male European identity in the face of a culture, society, era which is forcing us to adopt more global and inclusive identities. Their egos are scared of adopting a wider, more inclusive sense of self. That's all. The rest is just their justification games. "Science" and "reason" is used in these games because it lends an air of authority and truthfulness. After all, "How can one be wrong with science on one's side? Science is just objective facts, man! Facts don't care about your feelings. The data doesn't lie." LOL
</p>

<p>
	In reality there is no such thing as "data". There's ego cherry-picking & interpreting data to boost its survival.
</p>

<p>
	See, the devil always cloaks himself in a veneer of "truth".
</p>

<p>
	WinterNight is not boasting about it. He's very humble. Watch your projections.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with saying you are enlightened if you in fact are. All it means is that you are conscious of your true nature. That is not an egoic boast, unless you make it so.
</p>

<p>
	Of course plenty of folks on this forum claim to be enlightened when in fact they are not, or their enlightenment is very shallow. But some folks here are genuinely enlightened. Sometimes it's hard to sort the wheat from the chaff because communicating via forum doesn't give enough information in many cases. Although even via a forum, it's still quite clear who is spiritually mature and who isn't. You can tell just from the tone of their posts and their attitude. One of the hallmarks of a spiritually mature person is that he is unreactive and non-judgmental.

	It's WAY WAY WAY more radical than you can imagine. When you finally realize that you never even existed, that you were never even born, it leaves you totally speechless and baffled. Like, "WTF?????!!!!!! There was never a me? How is that even possible?????"

That experience stayed with her 33 years as of now. Sure she did three years of integration work, but her initial experience was permanent. Could the brain rewire itself that quickly?

<p>
	Lol, she was on the brink of suicide and suffered for YEARS! You are dismissing all that "work".
</p>

<p>
	Yes, if you drive yourself nuts to the brink of suicide and then finally the ego happens to collapse by some fluke instead of you actually killing yourself, the brain can then rewire itself. But it wasn't really quick. It was a process years in the making. It's like an explosion that was building up for years, and then one day it all burst.
</p>

<p>
	And even so, these kinds of cases are extremely rare. They might as well not exist. This is not a reliable strategy for awakening.

			Plus, from (1), your points are true, but it’s just so rare to find relatives enlightened at the same time. 90% of those gifted teachers do not have enlightened relatives. Doesn’t that say something about the correlation between enlightened teachers having gifted genes.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You make an interesting point. But I still think there is a physiological component to spiritual giftedness. It's just damn rare.
</p>

<p>
	How do you explain that many of the most awakened people experienced their awakenings very early in life, often when they are 12 years old, 18 years old, etc. How do you explain people who do one meditation retreat or self-inquire for a few weeks and become enlightened? That is extremely rare and atypical. An average person cannot do that. Otherwise a large percentage of the population would be enlightened, but they just aren't and can't.
</p>

<p>
	More broadly-speaking, how do you explain that less than 0.00001% of humans wake up? This cannot be explained simply by lack of effort. Even within people who do hardcore spiritual practice, STILL, less than 1% deeply awaken. Again, this is not merely due to lack of effort.
</p>

<p>
	There is a deep connection between one's effort in this work and one's spiritual intuition. Why are some people much more spiritually attuned than others? Why are some people totally spiritually clueless? Lack of effort is not enough to explain it because one's willingness to exert effort is directly proportional to one's initial spiritual attunement.
</p>

<p>
	So my claim is that the people who wake up are the ones who start out in life already highly spiritually attuned. Poor upbringing and environment can obscure this attunement, requiring some decades of life experience for the person to realize that they even have this spiritual attunement.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with spiritual attunement is that most people who have it take it completely for granted. They don't know what life is like without it because they've always had it, and they assume everyone else has it too. But most people don't. It's sort of like having a very high IQ or being very tall. You don't even realize that most people are not that way.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I am 6'2". It took me 30 years to realize that not everyone is that tall. To me, being tall feels totally normal. I don't even know what it means to be short. It took me 30 years to realize that the world is designed for short people: hotel showers, all chairs and sofas and benches, airplane seats, sinks, toilets, urinals, jackets, pants, cars, etc. I can't sit comfortably on most chairs because they are designed for short people and I only realized that a few years ago! I didn't realize it because I assumed that all people are the same.

	But your shadow is that which you think you are not.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you think you are an honest person, your shadow is liars. What you must integrate are liars, by realizing you are them.

<p>
	It's hard to say.
</p>

<p>
	I think it's a combination of: genetics, my philosphical mind, years of contemplating deep philosophical matters, my relentless curiosity about nature, my relative lack of emotional obstacles, my good heart, my emotional maturity, self inquiry, and my past breakthroughs on 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>
	Meditation does not feel like it was an important factor for me with respect to tripping.

<p>
	Any kind of personal dev work or spiritual work.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	And just master your life overall. Stop being a child.

<p>
	It's a total bastardization of philosophy.

		</p>

		<p>
			1) If those sages were genetically gifted why aren’t their siblings and parents also spirituality gifted, after all they have the closest resembling genes. Sadhguru was the youngest of thirteen children, yet I hear none of his other siblings are gurus. His parents? Ramana had a brother, what about him? Was he also gifted spiritually?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, even siblings are genetically diverse.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, the genetic factor is still only one factor. Hard training is also required. Sadhguru did yoga from a very early age. Genetics alone is not enough in most cases. All that genetics do is make it easier, not easy.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, witchcraft seems to have some heritable aspects. Children of witches are more likely to have paranormal abilities from my understanding.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			2) Overall, talking about the link between the neural system and awakening leaves a huge problem. What about spontaneous awakening that happened in the past many times. Those took only a few moments, and yet left a permanent awakening experience and a radical new state of consciousness. How did the entire neural system rewire itself in only a matter of a few moments? Because the person often goes from an unconscious depressed, hugely egoic person to an enlightened master in a couple of minutes. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't see any contradiction here. The cases you're describing are extremely rare and they could be explained by the mind web going through a catastrophic collapse and then reconfiguring itself.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, all deep awakening is sudden. But also gradual.
</p>

<p>
	Virtually no one becomes a enlightened master in a couple of minutes. This is pure fantasy. Eckhart Tolle, after his egoic collapse, spent 2 years sitting on a park bench. That was 2 solid years of his brain integrating his breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	The opposite of what you say is true: all enlightened masters that I know spent 10,000+ hours to become a master. And that was on top of their spiritual giftedness!
</p>

<p>
	On top of all this there could additional factors like karma, soul, past-lives, etc. It's way more complex than people think.
</p>

<p>
	Stefan is mistaking genetics with terrible economic inequality and culture.
</p>

<p>
	The IQ difference between whites and blacks is not a genetic problem, it's a social, political, and economic problem. If blacks were not economically and culturally oppressed, their IQ scores would rise by at least as much as their IQ difference between whites and blacks.
</p>

<p>
	The IQ is a very poor measure. IQ tests are culturally biased and they do not accurately measure intelligence, nor is intelligence or IQ a fixed genetic trait like eye color.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot change your eye color but you can change your intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to provide blacks and everyone else in the country with free high quality education. Then human intelligence will shoot through the roof.
</p>

<p>
	It is ironic that people who cite the IQ test are themselves not exhibiting any great intelligence.

<p>
	The paradox is that caring about other people can also become an obstacle. Women especially can develop an ego out of playing a "selfless" helper role.
</p>

<p>
	So you gotta strike a delicate balance.
</p>

<p>
	This whole process is a delicate balancing act. Too much to any one side results in pathology and getting stuck.

<p>
	Seems very likely.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it should be possible to take two brains/minds and merge them into one superbrain/supermind, resulting is some freaky stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a species in which every member's nervous system is interconnected with each other into a literal hive mind. That should produce some interesting new emergent stuff that cannot even be imagined.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute itself will never change. But the extent to which it understands itself, the extent to which is sees the interconnectedness of all form, should vary dramatically.
</p>

<p>
	The formless does not get more complex, but the form does. And since form and formless are one, to be totally omniscient will require a full integration of all form across all time. Which no human being can do no matter how enlightened they get.
</p>

<p>
	To put it another way, you do not fully understand what God is until you have experienced and integrated all form.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox of awakening is that it is Absolute, but it is not total. There are infinite degrees of totality because form extends forever. So you can keep realizing more and more of yourself forever without end. And that's exactly what evolution is doing.
</p>

<p>
	You are being far too flippant and one-dimensional. What you're exhibiting here is an absolutist pathology of awakening. A form of Zen devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Life is multiple-dimensional, infinite, and complex. There's way more to this work than you hold.
</p>

<p>
	What is silly is that you think you've reached some kind of end.

<p>
	Yes, and this is a complex and multi-dimensional thing. There is a LOT of subtle self-obsessed crap even after your first awakening.
</p>

<p>
	But also, realization is not just about becoming aware that you are nothing. It's also becoming aware that you are everything, and then realizing how God works through everything. So there are a lot of gems to be mined here.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org is a full-spectrum teaching. We are not merely interested in realizing nothingness here. We are interested in all dimensions of life and how they intersect with that Nothingness. That Nothingness turns out to be identical to every domain of life.
</p>

<p>
	How do you structure your life and society as a whole to align with your realization of Nothingness? How do you help elevate and awaken the whole world in an effective and non-pathological manner? These are the types of issues we're interested in here. We are interested in understanding what everything is and how everything interconnects. Which is a much broader scope than most spiritual teachings.
</p>

<p>
	I have taken a break from yoga and even meditation lately.
</p>

<p>
	My spirituality is becoming more organic and natural to the point where I am surrendering my rigid practices.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that the ultimate goal is for your entire life to become one seamless act of meditation, creativity, and love. You become God-like.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I still have a lot of work left. This is just a phase I'm going through, trying new stuff to see what works best.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, my mind is gradually becoming more and more quiet, making it easier to be in a semi-meditative state all the time, or at least especially when sitting down.

The question is - is this a sustainable way to become your highest self? 
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's true, we love shortcuts. Then again, not all shortcuts are automatically bad. The whole point of human society is to invent technological shortcuts for stuff that used to be impossible or really difficult. A car is a shortcut for walking to work. A farm is a shortcut for hunting migratory packs of animals. etc.
</p>

<p>
	Is it sustainable? I don't know. The research is still pending. What were are doing here with Actualized.org is on the cutting edge of human knowledge and technology. There is both risk and reward for being on the cutting edge. The discoveries we make, our children will take for granted as obvious. But right now it is not obvious.
</p>

<p>
	I would not recommend taking modafinil every day for months on end. Use it occasionally and stop if you feel like it's becoming a crutch. I don't use it much. Sometimes I just forget to take it for weeks at a time. I can function without it. But sometimes its a nice boost to my creative or meditative work.
</p>

<p>
	As of this writing I have not taken modafinil for over a month. Simply forgot it even existed. So to me it has no addictive quality at all. If I felt it had an addictive quality, I could probably not take it at all and I definitely would not recommend it publicly. My standard for recommending stuff publicly is that it must be non-addictive. For example, I do not recommend ketamine because it has some addictive qualities.
</p>

<p>
	I think modafinil can be very helpful to people who are new to this work. After years of meditation and so forth, you will probably outgrow it. Some people really struggle with ADHD, for example, and it's not just in their head. ADHD can cripple one's ability to self-actualize, which is a great shame. So it's nice if we have some tools for helping people to combat that.

<p>
	I don't think they change brain type.
</p>

<p>
	I think they can change how the brain is wired, which is very significant. Not sure about brain chemistry since there's no way I can measure that.
</p>

<p>
	Subjectively it feels like the last 13 5-MeO trips have significantly changed how my brain works in a permanent way. It's subtle, but also significant. I am not the same person I was a few months ago. But also, I'm not totally different either. It seems pretty clear to me that if I do another 50 trips, I will be permanently changed after that. My consciousness will be much more expanded at the very least. Perhaps even a more radical change could result. I suspect that at some point the brain/mind will totally collapse and reconfigure itself to function at a much higher level. Permanent superhuman levels seem within reach but I have not verified it yet. It's going to take a lot of tripping and serious integration work. And won't be easy.

<title>Love is a label for &quot;lack of resistance&quot;</title>

</p>

<p>
	You can think of it as "lack of resistance" but that's just one facet of it, and it's still a concept you're holding.
</p>

<p>
	ACTUAL Love is something you must become conscious of. There is no way around that. It's like the color red. You cannot reduce it to anything else. You must actually look at red to know what it is.
</p>

<p>
	The reason my descriptions are not landing with you, or don't seem useful to you, is because you are not in the right state of consciousness. It's like I'm describing an orgasm to someone who's never had one. So it falls on deaf ears.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe try some mushrooms, LSD, or MDMA.
</p>

<p>
	Realizing Absolute Love is an epic, life-transforming experience. It's about as radical as getting abducted by an alien. You can't really believe it until it's happening to you, and then it's so real it cannot be denied or doubted.
</p>

<p>
	When you change your DNA into that of a chimp, post us a selfie, and we will admit we were wrong.

<p>
	Epigenetics is real and valid. But it does not mean you can change it without limits. The limits are very tight, as they must be, to ensure you don't kill yourself.

<p>
	This topic goes way beyond realization.
</p>

<p>
	And what I'm saying is that there is no such thing as one "realization". That's an abstraction. In fact, each realization is unique, with a unique depth, breadth, level of embodiment, and corresponding state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And none of this contradicts Oneness or the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that realization does not happen in isolation. It is always intermixed with mind and brain. With one's state of development, with one's body, with one's energetic system, etc. The realization is happening through a unique human body and mind. So no two realizations are identical even though the Absolute is one.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is always the case, but one's awareness and understanding of the Absolute varies a great deal. Case in point, a mule does not understand the Absolute even though the Absolute is there in the mule. A mule is not aware of God, even though it is God.
</p>

<p>
	We are not saying that a human cannot change or grow in certain ways. But there are hard limits on what you can change. And it's also a question of how much work is involved in changing. Maybe you could change yourself, but it will take a lot of work, whereas some people are already born that way.

<p>
	You cannot teach a mule arithmetic no matter how hard you try.
</p>

<p>
	To deny this leads to gross errors, unworkable solutions, frustration, and even evil.
</p>

<p>
	Acknowledging the uniqueness and individuality of each human is very important to build a well-functioning society. You cannot treat everyone as an abstraction. Some people have very different needs.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Why People Seem Crazy
</p>

<p>
	It's one of my most important videos if you want to understand humanity.

</p>

<p>
	If physiology was irrelevant, then there would be no difference between humans and chimpanzees. Our DNA is 99% the same, yet that 1% difference makes a HUGE difference in capabilities. These differences are not just between species, they are within each species as well. That's how evolution works. There is diversity. There is no such thing as "a human" or "a chimpanzee". Each one is unique. With unique strengths and weaknesses.
</p>

<p>
	It could not be otherwise.

<p>
	It is not victim mindset to say that a gorilla has more strength than a human. A gorilla could rip the arms out of man's sockets and a rattlesnake can see in infrared whereas you cannot. A woman can give birth, a man cannot.
</p>

<p>
	This is just acknowledging that an organism's capabilities are related to its physiology and genetics. It's a very obvious fact which many tend to overlook because they love the idea that all people are equal. Well, all people may deserve equal civil rights, but they are not equal in capability. Not even close. Some people cannot add two numbers together. Some people cannot read a book. Some people cannot see the color red. Some people cannot walk. Some people are covered in hair from head to toe. Some people hallucinate flying monkeys. Some people are psychopaths. Some people are witches. Some people have telepathic abilities. Some people have an amazing sense of smell, like a dog. Some people have perfect pitch. Some people have super-human visualization abilities, like Nikola Tesla.

			What I hear this guy describing in this interview is kinda what I hear from you with all your awakenings with 5-MeO but he’s having this just naturally. He’s describing literally <i><u>thousands</u></i> of deeper and deeper states of consciousness without any sort of external leverage like a guru, teacher, or psychedelic. 
		</p>

<p>
	Yup, this certainly happens.
</p>

<p>
	People generally do not appreciate how much difference there can be between brains. Some brains are able to access spiritual dimensions 1000x more efficiently than others.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that evolution naturally selects for human brains to favor survival and fitting into society rather than witchcraft. As we know, tens of thousands of witches and mystics (the most spiritually gifted humans) were demonized and executed. Witches are demonized in basically all cultures around the world.

			These cases like Sadhguru, Ramana Maharshi, even Ralston who describes his staggering amount of work (the talent aka inherent capacity still has to be there in order to be actualized)... I personally have a hard time finding relating to these people because it’s like relating to a human fantasy in most cases. It’s like being a good runner but comparing yourself to the world record holder in the marathon. I thinks it’s tricky because these people don’t seem extrodinary so it seems like “well yeah I should be able to do this then.” These people are not your average no-self level enlightened people.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Absolutely! Do not even try to compare yourself to the likes of Sadhguru, Ramana, or Ralston. That is a recipe for depression. That would be like comparing your lifting ability to a forklift.
</p>

<p>
	It is imperative that you walk your own unique spiritual path, not some guru's path. Your path must match your strengths and capacities.

<p>
	Yes, appreciate freakish levels of excellence and consciousness in the same way you might appreciate freakish levels of musical skill or artistic skill. Don't expect everyone to be a Mozart, a Picasso, an Einstein, or a Da Vinci. These were gifted, genius people. They did not achieve it merely through hard work, although they did often work hard.
</p>

<p>
	At the same time, don't make victim-like excuses for why you cannot awaken. Don't think like this, "Oh well, I'm not as gifted as Sadhguru so I will never awaken." No! You can still awaken. It will just take more work.
</p>

<p>
	This also explains why psychedelics play such an important role. They allow people to access states of consciousness which the best gurus access naturally and effortlessly. The psychedelic levels the playing field. It's like taking a pill that would match your chess-playing abilities to Gary Kasporov. Then you can experience what it's like to play chess at a world-class level. You get to see what the guru sees. This allows you to understand the guru much better because now there is a set of common reference experiences between you two. And of course this motivates you to do the work because you see the amazing potential of the work which you would otherwise never see.
</p>

	LSD can definitely produce ego-death. At 125ug I get it basically every time.
</p>

<p>
	Every substance I've tried has produced ego-death for me at some point.
</p>

<p>
	Of course your results may vary.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is definitely the best for it. It's like pure ego-death in powdered form.

<p>
	Absolutely. In fact, I'd bet that the majority of enlightened people got there mostly due to their giftedness. It's just SO much easier that way. It's like being naturally high on psychedelics all the time.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to how the best weightlifters will be naturally selected for high testosterone. Those with naturally low testosterone simply won't be able to compete against them.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why many of the best gurus make the path sound easier than it actually is. It was easy for them. Yet it will be virtually impossible for ordinary folk.
</p>

<p>
	This is the kind of stuff gurus rarely admit. Because you cannot know this stuff from sitting on a meditation cushion. To know this requires broad psychological research which most gurus dismiss because it is not 1st person experience.
</p>

<p>
	Different brains have very different capabilities. It's not merely a matter of degree, it's also a different in kind. Some brains can access states and phenomena which other brains just cannot.
