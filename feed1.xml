<p>
	You could try meat + low sugar veggies like leafy greens and maybe some low sugar fruits like berries.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a gut bacteria problem, sugary fruits and veggies will certainly make it worse. After you fix the gut bacteria, then you can go for a more veggie/fruit diet. But until then I would avoid them.
</p>

<p>
	If you have SIBO nearly any fruit or veggie will do more harm than good.
</p>

<p>
	Liver Rescue assumes you don't have SIBO or leaky gut. But it sounds like you do.

<p>
	Life coaching is usually not suitable for people under 25 because the ROI isn't there and they aren't mature enough to male use of it. It only makes sense to coach people who have good incomes and are serious about optimizing their results.
</p>

<p>
	You might consider tutoring as a way to make ends meet. You can tutor high school and college kids. The is much more practical.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that people usually only pay for practical things. It's very challenging to market impractical stuff with low ROI.

<p>
	Usually any sugar is considered breaking the fast. Small amounts of fat are more tolerated since you can still stay in ketosis.
</p>

<p>
	You'll want to research specifically about how diabetics handle fasting. Not sure.

	$200,000 and $2k/mo in Washington means you are broke.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest challenge with building a commune is not the money, it is lack of consciousness and development. Your commune will quckly devolve into devilry if you do not possess unmost consciousness, leadership skills, and integrity in running it.

<title>Should you Avoid MultiVitamins When Fasting?</title>

<p>
	You should not because:
</p>

<p>
	A) The whole point of a fast is to rest your digestive system as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	B) Vitamins taken on an empty stomach can lead to some nasty nausea.
</p>

<p>
	You can survive just fine a few weeks without vitamins.

	And don't dismiss it as "at the level of mind", since whatever your mind is doing, is by definition something consciousness and the Universe is doing.

<p>
	There are many degrees of quality to psychology. It can be done poorly, it can be done exceptionally.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that you cannot have an accurate understanding of psychology without personal experience jailbreaking your own mind, which requires excellent grasp of epistemology, metaphysics, and spirituality.

<p>
	That's a problem in the US too. My family doctor laughed at me when I asked him if I might have leaky gut. He say leaky gut is a myth that cannot exist.

	Idiot doctors are a dime a dozen. Except they usually charge you more than a dime for their terrible advice.

			1) Using what protein and calorie sources? You frequently caution against grains, with the possible exception of white rice. So are you envisioning a diet consisting of mostly fruits and veggies, with some beans, lentils, tofu, seeds, nuts, healthy fats, and white rice? Sounds carb heavy, eating all that rice and beans.

<p>
	Basically any non-animal protein sources you can find that are organic.

			3) You seem to recommend oils over grains as a calorie source. Is this purely due to the autoimmune problems that whole grains often contribute towards? (In my own research, I have found some evidence that eating any extracted oils (e.g. olive oil, coconut oil, etc) is very bad for various aspects of health. I have experimented with this by cutting out all oils for multiple years, relying instead on whole grains as my main calorie source. Works fine for me now, but I am young.)

<p>
	I have since been doing more research and learning the importance of reducing oils.
</p>

<p>
	I used to believe that keto diet was healthy. Now I tend to believe it is not.
</p>

<p>
	Whole grains seem to be healthier calorie source as long as you aren't sensitive or allergic to the grains. I would avoid gluten grains, for example. But something like quinoa seems healthier than oil.

<p>
	If you feel good eating them, then I think it's okay.

<p>
	Keep in mind, people react to food differently. You must find your unique mix of items that your body tolerates well.

<p>
	A multi-party system does not necessarily have to be inefficient. Not sure why you take that to be inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	We just need to dial back the ideology and partisanship.

<p>
	Brita filters and their ilk are junk. They will not filter out heavy metals properly.
</p>

<p>
	If your filter system doesn't not cost at least $250, it is junk. You cannot filter water properly too cheaply. Nor can your filter water properly with a single filter. A multi-stage system is necessary. 3-6 stages. 3 stages is the bare minimum.

	My diet is not relevant to you because I have unique healthy conditions and some disorders.

<p>
	I also change my diet a lot as I test various things.

<p>
	See my video: How To Shop For Healthy Food
</p>

<p>
	Your #1 priority should be to eliminate all processes foods and sugar.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you shop at Walmart, that's not so bad if you buy fruits and veggies. Don't buy anything in a box or anything with added sugars, or anything baked or anything with added vegetable oil.
</p>

<p>
	Waffles, pizza, cookies, baked goods, ice cream -- these are all highly processed and toxic foods that you should never eat again.

<p>
	Yes, of course.

<p>
	But there is room for both. There will be shamanic stuff, and there will highly regulated, "official" medical type use of psychedelics. Going after shamanic practitioners is kinda silly in my view. They are just solo dudes. They will never be mainstream. If these PhD's want an "official" therapeutic system, then build it. Martin Ball is irrelevant to that goal.

<p>
	If you don't care about Truth, you really don't deserve awakening. And you will probably never get it. And even if you get some of it, you won't get all of it. And even then, you will bastardize it.

	The prequels were not great in execution, but as least they were imaginative and had original ideas.

	China is growing fast now cause they were so underdeveloped for so long. But their growth will hit diminishing return and they will face increasing internal collapse because growth and authoritarianism are incompatible for long.
</p>

<p>
	China will be forced to democratize.
</p>

<p>
	China will face all the same interal problems the US faces. It will take China some decades just to grow up into America's kind of problems.
</p>

<p>
	Don't assume that China just magically skirt these problems.

<p>
	If her PhD was in physics, it would not be much better for purposes of discussing mystical practices.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is that Ball is engaging in mystical practices while these PhD's are discussing it in terms of "legal or therapeutic professional framework". This is like criticizing a dog for not adhering to legal frameworks. There is no legal framework for this shit. And there is not even a scientific one.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, I still don't really agree with Ball's approach. It's needlessly pushy in my opinion. That's the only real problem I see here. Never push a newbie to trip harder if he doesn't want to. It's important that the newbie take 100% responsibility to trip, so that he can never blame you for it. It must be his decision to go deeper. If the client does not give a definitive YES, don't give him any more 5-MeO. Pushing enlightenment on people is not good practice. It will backfire at some point.

<p>
	Of course the objective world and narrative world touch. What's he's missing is that reality is imaginary. Which is why they touch. The objective world is a dream. So is Christ. And JP is God.
</p>

<p>
	He's circling around the answer but will never put his finger on it because he's attached to science, objectivity, morality, meaning, realism, and Christianity.

So it will not cook as well as a proper $150 SS pan.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, SS pans can produce very nice sears. You just need to find the right temp. SS pans have a bit of a learning curve. But once you learn it, making dishes is very easy.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect an SS pan to be as non-stick as a Teflon or Ceramic pan. It never will be. But the pan can last you decades, unlike Teflon pans which you gotta change ever few years. So in the end, Teflon pans are actually more expensive.

<p>
	You can't really use the God word with a scientist because it instantly triggers all their defense mechanisms. The last thing a materialist scientist can admit is that there is a God. So if he knows that's what you're trying to convince him of, his mind will go into 100% denial mode. So it's better to refer to it as Consciousness or Infinity or Universe.

<p>
	The US will never be a one party state. Those kinds of tactics are only workable at lower levels of development where authoritarian methods are used.
</p>

<p>
	A one party state can only exist if it crushes all the other parties with force. And continues doing so chronically.

	That's the whole game of academia: lots of highly technical talk, but very little truth or wisdom. Hence it ends up being so dumb. Because getting the big picture right is way more important than getting the technical minutia right.

	I am a fan, but actually I very rarely use it.
</p>

<p>
	I think some of you guys get the wrong idea that I use it every day or every week. That's not the case.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that I don't use any substances chronically other than vitamins. Be careful not to create chronic consumption habits with chemicals.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, an occasional Modafinil is not a problem.

	Right after he sold it, he wrote a script for the new trilogy -- which Disney rejected -- and he got pissed. And he still does some work on the Mando show. So clearly he still has a passion for it.
</p>

<p>
	If I built a passion project like Star Wars, I would rather have it die than sell it off to Disney. What Disney is doing with Star Wars is worse than killing it. It would be like selling Actualized.org to Tai Lopez. I'd rather it just die.

<p>
	I think it would have been better for Lucas to just hire a great CEO and great directors and producers to take over LucasFilm, and he would only do some creative consulting as they take the reigns.

<p>
	Personally, when I trip sit someone, my policy is to stay completely silent and not interfere at all as much as I can stand.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard though. The ego really wants to interfere, get in there, and do stuff. But all that stuff is unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
	I try to only talk when the person wants me to talk. But it's not always easy to just sit silently.
</p>

<p>
	I think these shaman types get off on the idea that they are a vehicle for God and that their actions are important to the trip. So they get too proactive about it. Otherwise it would be hard for a shaman to justify his work/job. The shaman needs to bring his own personal touch to the process, put his own brand on it. Otherwise being a shaman would not be fun.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the other big mistake here is that 5-MeO-DMT should not be vaped, it should be plugged. Especially for newbie clients.

</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem with the show is that it is so transparently fan service. It's like the producers sat down at the table and ask, "Okay, how can we milk the original Star Wars fans in every way imaginable? Let's make a show solely about that!"
</p>

<p>
	The ending of season 2, with Luke, was so awful. Pure milking fan service. There is not a level too low that this show will not stoop to to milk the fans.
</p>

<p>
	The Star Wars universe has become so derivative. There's nothing original about it any more. Same old shit rehashed over and over again to milk rube fans. It's basically a form of abuse.

<p>
	That is pretty amazing.
</p>

<p>
	Lucas is certainly a more conscious guy than most Hollywood types.
</p>

<p>
	But still, did he really have to sell to Disney of all places? If there ever was a corporate devil, Disney would be it.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I sold Actualized.org to Disney.

<p>
	They make some valid points, but they are really punching down here. Martin Ball is basically a nobody. He's a solo shaman guy. He's not some legit established doctor or scientist, and the people who see him are hippies of his own ilk.
</p>

<p>
	This is not an issue I would spend any time worrying about. These "doctors" should be frying bigger fish, like the war on drugs. There is a sort of lack of priorities problem here. With all the shit going on in the world, Martin Ball is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	Credibility and authority is a very trick social game. Once you get into that game, you gotta be super careful because everyone will be looking to discredit you. You gotta suit their standards.
</p>

<p>
	Medicine, science, and academia are social reputation games. Your credibility in those fields matters way more than truth or depth of insight or consciousness.

<p>
	It's sort of funny to me how these "doctors" are deconstructing Martin Ball's practice line by line, as if they were combing through a legal document, when in fact Martin was just some hippie dude in hippie Oregon offering underground illegal shamanic work to other hippies.
</p>

<p>
	The things they say have some merit in that Martin Ball engages in what I consider some weird and unnecessary practices, but what the fuck does one expect when working with an underground hippie shaman doing illegal drugs? Of course it's not going to conform to some strict medical ethical codes. Lol
</p>

<p>
	These "doctors" might as well deconstruct how you and your buddy where sitting on the couch smoking weed and cracking jokes, but there was no consent from signed.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I think the biggest flaw in Martin's approach is that he is smoking the 5-MeO-DMT along with the client. It's much more responsible to trip sit sober. If he was sober he probably wouldn't be doing weird stuff. Two people tripping together can way out of hand as the insanity cross-multiplies.
</p>

<p>
	Take a fork and scratch your pan. Watch the coating flake off.

	Don't get anything coated. It must be solid so nothing can scratch off.

	The core is aluminum. It is wrapped in steel. This should not be a problem. The steel is not merely a coating, it's a solid thick layer. No aluminum is getting through that steel.

			Maybe..... I'd love to see someone look into this. Follow a cohort of 100 people who use different pans and see their urinary and tissue levels (confirmed by biopsy) of different heavy metals change after a year. Otherwise, we're all just fearmongering and many of these arguments are based on thin air.

	Just look at the reviews of the pan you linked. Look at how the coating scratches off in the pics. All ceramic coated pans scratch off like that. And where do you think that coating goes? In your food.

	Ceramic coated pans are garbage. They all chip into your food. You should not buy any pan which is coated in anything because all the coating soon flake off.

	A lot of stuff you fry on a pan can simply be baked or steamed, which is much healthier and even less work. If you use foil, you don't even need to clean  anything.
</p>

<p>
	Charring food is not so healthy.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The urge to jump is precisely because you're so conscious you realize it makes absolutely no difference whether you jump or not. So why not jump? You want to jump just to prove to yourself that death isn't real and there is nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>
	Once, on a high dose of 5-MeO-DMT I got the urge to turn on the stove and press my hand on it, just to see that pain isn't real.
</p>

<p>
	So yeah, you do have to be careful. It is possible to do stupid and dangerous things on psychedelics. Psychedelics can eliminate all your normal inhibitions because they wipe out fear. Fear is basically what keeps you alive.

<p>
	No, it doesn't work like that. Such urges on psychedelics are brief. You will not go through all the hassle of going to your care just to get a key to jump out a window. By the time you walk to the your car you will forget you even cared about jumping.

<p>
	Don't eat for at least 4 hours before tripping. Then you are safe. The stomach digests all its food within like 2-3 hours. Then it is empty.

	I get a strong urge to jump out the window on DMT. The love is so strong it literally makes you want to kill yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms not so much.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe you can bolt a simple padlock on the window and hide the key in your car. Just for peace of mind. Better safe than sorry. People sometimes to stupid things on high doses of psychedelics.

Condoms break, slip, stuff leaks out, etc. It is foolish to expect all those stars to align for years and years. You've already rolled the dice many times and at some point you will roll snake eyes. Its just a matter of time.
</p>

<p>
	Given your age, everything I said is twice as relevant because at your age there's little chance you'll stay with him forever, even if there was no STD issue. You have to be realistic that relationships at that age are immature and tend to fizzle out rather quickly. Maybe if you were 40 years old and had no other options and you wanted to finally settle down you might have a case to make. But at 21?
</p>

<p>
	And living with herpes for the rest of your life from age 22 onward is really a bummer. The bulk of your sexual life is all ahead of you. Your prime years are 20-35. Don't squander it.

<p>
	Yes, it certainly is.
</p>

<p>
	But that is not the same as a girl giving you advice about how to attract girls or how to be a man.
</p>

<p>
	A girl can tell me her perspective, but I don't need her advice for how to do what men do. She has no clue about that and will give bad advice. She does not understand the obstacles that men face in this domain and the pragmatics of the situation.

<p>
	A) Not necessarily. The whole point of socialism is to change that system.
</p>

<p>
	B) Even if there is an owner or a boss, that's not a problem per se. The problem is the systemic value extraction and exploitation. Owners and bosses deliberately conspire to squeeze hard working employees for value. Nothing is stopping Jeff Bezos from paying his employees double or triple. And they deserve it since they built that company. Bezos could still be ridiculously wealthy and Amazon could still be very profitable and successful even while paying x3 wages.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a value extraction system. That value is generated by the lowest employees, then squeezed upwards and given to shareholders.
</p>

<p>
	That is the entire point of Wall Street.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

			Also what do you mean by "hard working"? You are the one who always says that most people are lazy, uncreative and do the most mundane, uninspired work. Now you picture the average Joe as this super hard working, creative, massive value generator who always works so hard but evil people trading the shares of his company exploit all of this poor guy's efforts. This also seems contradictory.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The average Joe is hardworking, but does not generate much creative value. But even the most creative people who work for large companies get very little reward. Some average Joes are lazy, but they still do work and still deserve more pay. If they are super lazy then just pay them less.
</p>

<p>
	I believe that hardworking Joe should be paid more because his work is often very hard. Think of Amazon's lowest level employees who barely have enough time for pee breaks. And I believe the creative folks should also earn a lot more. Basically all workers should get paid way more while shareholders and executives should get way less.

<p>
	They work hard at stealing value, sure. And Jeffery Epstein worked hard at raping girls, well above average.

<p>
	It's not just religion, it's the dogmatic mindset that religion instills in people.
</p>

<p>
	The problem in America is excessive stage Blue dogma the obstructs much-needed progress.
</p>

<p>
	Europeans are less enmeshed in that, thus they are more open to stage Green progressive governance.
</p>

<p>
	Christian fundamentalism has hijacked the minds of many Americans, making progressive politics nearly impossible. It's like trying to drag a mule up Mt Everest. So here we are.
</p>

<p>
	Europe is not perfect. They still have religion and stage Blue, just less so, and less powerful. Europe is more secular.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that religion does not work in isolation. Religion creates an entire worldview and paradigm that infects many other aspects of life: work, economics, healthcare, education, politics, etc. It all comes as one package such that when you try to get a person to question their ideas of abortion or capitalism or guns or education or immigration  -- they perceive it as an attack on their God. It's a giant tangled meme-complex, not just a few separate memes.

			jim and Tony and the Neo Advaitans may not have realized god but it seems they have realized no self, I suppose that’s a start. That is a sort of awakening in itself, hopefully when I realize no self through experience I do not trivialize life like they do, I don’t think it’s a worthless perspective but it’s awful tough living in a dream just constantly telling the other dream people that they don’t exist aha I feel like that is already implied but it’s a paradox and a mystery I guess

<p>
	You can learn from anyone, but on this particular topic learning from women is just so unnecessary. It's like learning about makeup from men or learning hunting from a vegan.
</p>

<p>
	If women want to teach dating advice, let them teach it to women. Women do not really understand the specific sexual needs of men. Nor do they care.

<p>
	False. Every single psychic I visited was extremely confident in their abilities and suggestions. Too confidence. So confidence they often fooled me into their delusions.

<p>
	Trust me, if the pain gets high enough you will automatically surrender. Extreme pain actually destroys the ego. Pain is actually something that ego creates, so when the pain gets too high the ego cannot keep creating it any more.

</p>

<p>
	If this was not the case, everyone would escape. But very few do.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically, to escape wage slavery requires working twice as hard as other people work.
</p>

<p>
	When I escaped my job I was working so hard, nonstop, days, nights, weekends, holidays -- it was so emotionally stressful I would just cry sometimes. It was extremely difficult. But here's the kicker: it was the best thing I ever did for myself.
</p>

<p>
	You get from life what you put into it.
</p>

<p>
	"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation."
</p>

<p>
	In the end it all boils down to what you're willing to put up with. You're willing to settle for a shitty life and boring job -- that's exactly what you'll get.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I would rather kill myself than work a boring job my whole life. Which is exactly why I was able to create an alternative for myself. I refused to settle. The pain of escaping wage slavery was high for me, but the pain of surrendering to a boring job was higher.
</p>

<p>
	This is nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	Sleeping with a guy who you definitely know has an STD is way more risking than sleeping with a random guy who has a tiny chance of having it.
</p>

<p>
	You are talking about 100% vs 10-20%. Anything is better than 100%. And you should not be fucking randos without a condom regardless. It's not like just because you've fucked a guy 20 times yet he has an STD, that the odds of you getting it diminish.

<p>
	Well, I understand your point. It's a sad situation. But also, is it really humane for him to infect you and other girls with it?
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with "idiot compassion". I know you have developed a soft spot for him, you love him, etc. But remember, romantic love tends to be a fickle thing. Chances are your relationship with him with end anyway in the next 5-10 years for other reasons. And then you'll be left single with herpes. That is not a good situation to put yourself in.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be so compassionate that you nail yourself to a cross. Also consider your own well-being. In fact, your health is more important than his desire for sex. At least it should be from your POV.
</p>

<p>
	Ditching him sounds harsh. But him knowingly giving you herpes sounds harsher.
</p>

<p>
	I understand you find yourself in an impossible situation. But nevertheless I think you should have higher standards and move on, as harsh as that sounds. He will understand. It's not like you're being a jerk here. You have the most legit reason ever for breaking a relationship. If you can't break a relationship over this, when can you?
</p>

<p>
	A healthy relationship should not involve you taking a bullet for him.
</p>

<p>
	What is your age? It would help to know that.

	I heard it from a parrot owner/breeder. Not sure if it's true. His point was to never roast nuts for birds using Teflon pans. When I heard that, I realized I should stop using Teflon for myself too.

<p>
	Yeah, but Teflon is not some natural food product like sugar or chocolate. It is a chemical and if you research that specific chemical you will find that it is not some harmless thing to living organisms. Research that whole class of chemicals. It ain't good for ya.
</p>

<p>
	That Teflon also always scratches off over time and those flakes end up in your food. That can't be healthy. You are literally eating Teflon flakes like lead paint chips.

<p>
	Impossible to say because there are so many other variables at play with my health.
</p>

<p>
	It's not going to be something you feel immediately. Rather it might mean that 20 years from now you don't get cancer which you otherwise would have if you kept eating Teflon.
</p>

<p>
	It's just an unnecessary risk to take. You can easily use stainless steel pans for 95% of your cooking needs. The biggest problem with steel pans is that they suck for pancakes, crepes, and that sort of thing. But I don't eat those anyway. There may be ways to make those in the oven instead on parchment paper or silicone. There are many healthier methods of cooking than a frying pan which you should research, invest in, learn, and master.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The stealing has been abstracted by the system. It is systemic stealing. The point of the system is precisely to give you, the trader, plausible deniability. So that if anyone questions you, you can genuinely  say, "But I didn't break any laws. I just sold some paper to someone else who wanted to buy it. So how could that be evil?"
</p>

<p>
	You need to think holistically about how the whole Wall Street system works. The bottom line is this: If you earned a million dollars for clicking a few button on your computer, you obviously didn't work for it by creating any genuine stuff, therefore you must have stolen it from someone else who did.
</p>

<p>
	Where did that million come from? It came from exploitation of the labor of works of the company you invested into. That million really belongs to them. But you used the Wall Street system to separate it from them. So while you enjoy your million, some mother working at Walmart cannot afford to buy medicine for her sick child and he dies. But the system is designed such that you don't see that and don't care.

</blockquote>

<p>
	In a sense this is true. The difference is that I'm aware of that. And also the difference is that I worked hard for my money and it is not fair to me to have my money inflated. So I feel it is reasonable to hedge against inflation. You can say that's selfish, and you'd be right. It is. But life is selfish. I'm not just gonna sit by and watch my money deflate.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, we're all stuck in Game A to some degree. No matter how much you try to break out of Game A, you can't entirely avoid it. But you can at least not deliberately and gleefully double-down on Game A -- which is what stock get rich quick schemes do.

<p>
	Yes, and I'm okay with that. I also worked for money and when inflation happens someone else is getting a portion of my savings "for free" by eroding it.

<p>
	Food sticks more than a Teflon pan, but mostly it doesn't stick so bad. You just use some butter or oil and heat it proper. Don't put food into an unheated steel pan. Food tends to self-release as it cooks through.
</p>

<p>
	Cleaning steel pans is very easy. Pour some water in it. Let it stand a few hours and the food bits will scrub off easy with a brush.

<p>
	I make eggs in my steel pan all the time. Not a problem.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you are used to a Teflon pan nothing will be that easy or nonstick.
</p>

<p>
	Steal pan requires a bit more worl and care. But they also last a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	All pro chefs use stainless steel pans. There's just a bit of a learning curve. And they are 5x more expensive.

<p>
	All that is still finite.
</p>

<p>
	There is only one actual INFINITY, of which all your conceptualizing about infintities is a tiny part.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that INFINITY cannot be turned into a concept, which means the logical mind cannot ever grasp it. Which is why spiritual practices teach you to shut off your mind.

<p>
	Making that much is devilry and manipulation itself. The manipulation is built right into the market so that devils like you cans say, "See, I didn't steal from anyone." But actually, you did. Since you didn't generate any real value.
</p>

<p>
	That's capitalism. All the systems are unconsciously designed to steal value from people yet all the theives can tell themselves that didn't steal anything and thus sleep well at night.
</p>

<p>
	Your millions came from many working people losing what little they had. Your freedom costs 10-100 people to be wage slaves for life.

<p>
	How many Infinities can there be?
</p>

<p>
	ONE
</p>

<p>
	If you think there can be two Infinities, you weren't thinking of Infinity to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that your idea of Infinity is actually finite, and thus not it.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to understand it is like this: How can there be two Gods? If God is the creator of everything, and you think there can be 2 or more of them, then which God created the other God? And what is the point of the 2nd one if the 1st one is more powerful than the 2nd, since it was first to exist.

<p>
	The key difference is that I do not use the stock market to make my money.
</p>

<p>
	It is a problem when you guys try to use the stock market as your method of getting rich.
</p>

<p>
	Stocks are fine for holding some savings and getting a 8% average annual return. The problem comes when you expect your stocks to give you 10x returns and make you rich.
</p>

<p>
	Make yourself rich, then put some of your riches into the market to avoid inflation.

	Stainless steel.
</p>

<p>
	Never buy non-stick or ceramic.
</p>

<p>
	Ceramic pans are a gimmick. They are not truly ceramic, they have a cheap ceramic chemical coating which chips and puts toxins in your food, just like teflon.
</p>

<p>
	Your pan must have no coatings. Any coating will chip.

A lot of meditation practice, retreats, contemplation, books about enlightenment, intellectual understanding, better mindset and vision towards a thing -> hence why it might work so goodly for you, while other people without that might have way worse results via psychedelic?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Certainly that's part of it. But, no, it goes much deeper than that for me.
</p>

<p>
	My brain is literally wired for psychedelics. Any psychedelic is 2-3x more potent for me than other people, and perhaps not just potency but also qualitative differences too. It's hard to compare qualitative differences so I can only speculate there.
</p>

<p>
	Basically any starting dose of psychedelic for me is a crazy breakthrough. 2g of mushrooms, 120ug of LSD, 15mg of 5-MeO-DMT, 70mg of DPT, a few puffs of DMT, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And at higher doses my trips are simply unreal in their strength and holism.
</p>

<p>
	I've friends and others take psychedelics without anything near this reaction. I would say that their reaction is 10x less than mine would be at their dose. Not just less quantitatively but qualitatively.
</p>

<p>
	To be honest, it feels like I was born on this Earth to consume psychedelics. Like God designed my brain specifically for that purpose. You can call that delusional, but I've tripped enough at this point to feel that there is a deep intelligence behind my discovery of psychedelics and I know for a fact that my spiritual journey would be incomplete without them. They were not some side-show or distraction for me. They were CORE to my spiritual growth.
</p>

<p>
	Now, that does not mean you are the same. That may not be true for you.
</p>

<p>
	All of my deepest wisdom came from psychedelics. I know for sure that I could not get it otherwise. Maybe some other people could, but I could not. And in the end I gotta do what works for me. But I suspect it will work for thousands of other people too. But not all people.

	Be careful, ketamine can be addictive and it is toxic to your kidneys.
</p>

<p>
	I have no doubt it can produce some awesome nondual states. But I try to avoid stuff that can harm my body. It's not really necessary when you have so many healthy psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	But at some point I'll try it just for the sake of reporting it to you guys.

<p>
	It's A LOT more refined.

<p>
	The movie Lord of War shows you the clear difference between stage Orange and stage Red power, status, and luxury.

<p>
	The hilarious thing about this whole situation is that Megan doesn't even look black! If I saw her walking down the street I would assume she's white. I didn't know she was black until this story broke.
</p>

<p>
	Their kid is gonna look so white that it's moot.
</p>

<p>
	Which does not speak well about the royal family. If they could not stomach someone who looks this white, just imagine their reaction if Harry brought home a 100% black girl. The queen would have a heart attack <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<p>
	Keef having been born IS the dream.
</p>

<p>
	You were not really born. You are imagining you were. The histories and stories are also imagined by you in the present moment. All your memories are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Not only is the French Revolution imaginary, even your memory of learning it back in school is imaginary!
</p>

<p>
	You are constantly dreaming, which renders reality as you see it.

	Yes, it's actually a problem. It's hard to relate to how I used to be and how most people are. I have to actively think back to my past to remember where I started from and how much has changed.

	Because to guys, size does matter. But it's not only size, it's also shape.
</p>

<p>
	Breast augmentation not only affects size but also shape.
</p>

<p>
	Also, a lot of times big tits looks amazing when dressed and covered over with cloth, but terrible naked. So you gotta watch out not to get bamboozled by surface appearances.

</p>

<p>
	The root cause seems to be triggering toxins and foods. But it's very hard to discover what those triggers are. Could be anything you drink or put in your mouth. Or even the dirty air you breathe every day from the nearby highway.
</p>

<p>
	I suspect that eating lots of raw honey might have caused my condition. Raw honey could have lots of pesticides and chemicals in it. But it's so hard to know for sure. These are just guesses.

</p>

<p>
	But even then, you will never feel as clear-minded as you will on an empty stomach. That's just some basic biology. Which is why spiritual traditions around the world employ fasting. All the great mystics fasted a lot. The Buddha and Christ nearly killed themselves fasting so much.

<p>
	First of all, psychedelics affect people very differently. Just because it's a crazy strong trip does not mean you'll really grok it.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, most people are not serious about sense-making or epistemology. This creates a serious bottleneck for understanding one's deepest trips. The trip is so outside of conventional epistemology and metaphysics that it's virtually impossible to make sense of it for most people -- unless they've done years of deep work with epistemology and metaphysics.

			My question is: if these realizations are outside of conceptual understanding anyway, then why would contemplation of any sort be required to understand these states of consciousness? Why aren't they self-explaining/obvious? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It is not strictly required. Just highly helpful because your trip will end and you will drop in state and you will back to living ordinary life. The contemplation is mostly helpful for changing your ordinary life, so you see ordinary life more deeply. Otherwise you trips comes and goes like a dream, and you have little to show for it.
</p>

<p>
	High states of consciousness ARE self-explanatory, but once you lose that state, you will be left with nothing.
</p>

<p>
	For me, contemplation, metaphysics, and epistemology are all perfectly intertwined such that when I understand a thing with my mind it also perfectly synches with the self-explanatory nature of high state of consciousness. The two feed each other and lead to crazy powerful insights about all domains of life.
</p>

<p>
	For example, wouldn't you like to know why war happens? Why orgasm happens? What causes fear? What causes suffering? If yes, then you will need some contemplation to understand that. Experiencing an orgasm is not the same thing as existentially understanding the nature of orgasm. Every fool as experienced an orgasm, but almost no one knows the significance of what it is and why it is. Like, why does consciousness have orgasms? What is an orgasm from the POV of Absolute Consciousness?

<p>
	God can know itself perfectly. It seems like it cannot simply because you have not reached a state of infinite omniscience.
</p>

<p>
	Just think about it? God created the entire universe and all humans and shit. But God cannot know itself? Don't take God for an idiot. God has to know itself otherwise it could not create the universe with such perfect intelligence. God has to be able to see the FULL picture, not just some finite part. God must know everything otherwise it would not be infinite.

		</p>

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	99% of humans are in a non-enlightened state. Obviously. Just look at how they act. Like zombies and animals.
</p>

			Yet Absolute Truth, if Absolute, must be true regardless of state. How do we come to terms with this contradiction? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is no contradiction. Non-enlightened states are still fully Absolute and Truth. The only difference is that the person is not aware of this fact. For example, when you are in dream state at night, you are conscious and you're aware of stuff, but you are usually not aware that you are dreaming. If you become lucid in your dream, now you are aware that you dreaming. But the dream is Truth regardless of whether you are lucid or not.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like, you can have cancer, but that doesn't mean you know you have cancer. Think of Truth like hidden cancer. You have it but you don't know you have it until you awaken and realize, "Oh! Of course! Truth was always here the whole time. Why was I so blind?"

			In my experience, state changes are critical for bringing back that which transcends state changes to all states. This question seems to be at the heart of the issue with the whole enlightenment is not a state, vs. it is a state debate.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This issue is easily resolved with null state. The null state is what Buddhist aspire to and hold as the Absolute. The null state is of course Absolute, but it is no more Absolute than non-null states.
</p>

<p>
	When consciousness is totally inactive, totally not dreaming, it enters the null state of pure formlessness. But it is a serious mistake to confuse this null state for "The Truth" or "The Absolute". That is a sneaky bias as now you identify with the null state more than all other states. In fact, the null state is not better than more important than any other state, including the state of total monkey mind.

			Wait, I thought life purpose was meant for me to find my deeper values, and provide my values onto society, no matter how small/niche it is, with whatever skillset I have? However, what happens when the impact I'm aiming to have on the world/society I live, the contribution I think I want to give, might get rejected because it's too new, like for example creating a new business or vocation, and most of society rejects it?

<p>
	If you are truly creative and innovative it is basically guaranteed that your work and ideas and creations will be rejected, demonized, ridiculed, and attacked.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of LP is to become so grounded in your vision that you are not shaken by such ignorant attacks.
</p>

<p>
	Take a look at the work Gandhi or MLK or even Elon Musk. Elon Musk's Telsa was so short-sold by Wall Street traders that they almost forced Tesla into bankrupcy. But Musk's vision won out over their ignorance and look who's laughing now.
</p>

<p>
	The majority of people are fearful, selfish, closedminded, and ignorant. Your job is to show them the way. Take their hand and lead them out from the dark into the light. Of course, as you extend your hand to them, don't be surprised that a few of them will bite you.

Trust no one. When you reach Absolute Truth, you'll know it. When you reach God, you'll know it. When you reach Love, you'll know it. When you reach Infinity, you'll know it.
</p>

<p>
	These things require no human validation. That's the beauty of them. They do not depend on any guru or teacher.
</p>

<p>
	You are Consciousness, You are God, you are Love, you are Infinity, you are ONE, you are Truth, you are Absolute, you are Everything, you are Nothing.
</p>

<p>
	What more is there to say? The rest is hairsplitting.

<p>
	Just to be clear, my position is not that big tits is always best. Many big tits are just gross, and many smaller tits are beautiful. Tit shape is actually more important than pure volume.
</p>

<p>
	There is not one right body type. Guys have a variety of tastes. Just look at porn site comments. A lot of times I read a comment under a model/girl and guys are raving about her, but I don't find her attractive at all, and vice versa. So be careful not to reduce physical attraction down to a single thing. There are like 10 or 20 different factors that combine to create a physical attraction score. And there are always trade-offs.

<p>
	Nonsense
</p>

<p>
	You experience degrees of consciousness in your own life every day. When you are tired and sleepy your consciousness is less than when you take a cup of coffee.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is like taking 1 million cups of coffee at once.
</p>

<p>
	If psychedelics can teach you one thing it's just how many degrees of consciousness there are. If you trip only once, that will be enough to see that Spira is wrong.
</p>

	If you want some serious lucid dreaming, try Mexican and African dreaming herb. That's what it's for.

<p>
	Of course spirit is everywhere, because it is everything. It's only a matter of how intensely conscious are you of it?
</p>

<p>
	Your visual field is always made out of spirit and it is always Absolute. You just tend to ignore it as you go about survival.
</p>

<p>
	Never forget, the entire visual field is God.
</p>

<title>5-Meo-Dmt fumarate</title>

<p>
	With new substances, always start low and ramp up gradually. Then you are sure to be safe.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt there is much meaningful difference between the various 5-MeO-DMT types. As long as it's pure. A 20% difference is not that noticeable or meaningful. You can always handle 20% higher than you anticipated. The problem is when it's 2x or 3x stronger than you anticipated. That's when you get into trouble and get stuck in a bad trip.

<title>Report from 7-Day Kriya Yoga Retreat at Home</title>

<p>
	If you really want to crank up your retreats, combine it with water fast. Don't eat any food during the whole retreat. Your mind will become crystal clear. Food fucks with your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Water fasting is painful though the first few days. It really tests your self-discipline and tolerance for discomfort.
</p>

<title>&quot;My 5 MeO DMT experience&quot; (Adeptus Psychonautica doesn't get it)</title>

<p>
	Metaphysical and epsitemic contemplation is required to make psychedelics fully flower.
</p>

<p>
	A big trip without intense sense-making effort is sort of a waste. The point is to use the psychedelic experience to clean up your sense-making. Otherwise you drop out the high state and right back into your old sense-making paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	But with all that said, Adeptus still got a very profound awakening experience. He just needs to do more sense-making work with it in the future. What he's describing is Godhead/Infinity.
</p>

I love the intensity and proactivity you put into this.
</p>

<p>
	This is how this work should be done. Seriously, not dabbling around the edges with weaksauce methods.

			Best advice I've gotten regarding this was that your <u>mind, body and spirit</u> need all to be on board. After some weeks you get the feeling it's "time" again. Then you can roughly plan it like "maybe I'm gonna trip on Saturday". Then you feel into yourself on Saturday and truly sense how you feel: "Is my body ready? Is my mind ready? Is my spirit ready?". 
		</p>

		<p>
			If there's a small mirage of fear, that's not a big issue. I find it quite conducive to the quality of the trip. Makes you take it seriously.
		</p>

		<p>
			Just be careful not to force yourself to go further. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes! This is great advice. That's my method.

			Do you have an opinion that snorting DPT is more potent than plugging or is it roughly the same for you?

<p>
	And snorting does not burn like fuck? Ass burn is a pleasure by comparison.
</p>

<p>
	I would not snort so much substance. It might wreck your nose. Your ass is less sensitive than your nose, given all the shit it deals with.
</p>

<p>
	Vaping DPT feels off to me. I tried it once and have no desire to try it again. But maybe for you it will be more pleasant. I dunno.
