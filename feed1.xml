Making a lot more practical than LSD or others. You don't need to be in a retreat setting. Just a comfortable undisturbed setting for 60 mins.

<p>
	Yes, that is prrcisely what awakening and spirituality is about: seeing through all illusions as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	At first your ability to see through illusions is weak. With practice it becomes so strong that you finally see through the illusion of death, time, space, and physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, everything is an illusion.
</p>

			Life Purpose is about driving yourself to make an impact in the world. But this can only work if you are stuck in the illusion of control. In reality, you have no control whatsoever. As soon as you realise this (Enlightenment), driving yourself is no longer a possibility. As soon as you become aware of non-doership, you can no longer drive yourself to do anything, because you have no control over anything at all.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Why are you making such groundless assumptions??
</p>

<p>
	Since there was no one in control to begin with, that means nothing is lost with enlightenment. No-control is not opposed to drive. Drive is done by the universe, not by the ego. The ego is just an offshoot of universal drive.
</p>

<p>
	After enlightenment your life purpose becomes a force of the universe -- just like it always was. Nothing changed. Only some egoic delusions of control were removed.
</p>

<p>
	You assume that life purpose is an egoic thing, but it does not have to be.

Your technique or dosage may just be off.
</p>

<p>
	B) HCl can be smoked too.
</p>

<p>
	C) HCl can be converted to freebase pretty easily from what folks say.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is not a substance you want to give up on easily. Find a way to make it work. It will be worth it.

You will just require an above average dose.
</p>

<p>
	Throwing up is solved by taking it on a completely empty stomach.
</p>

<p>
	If snorting and plugging don't do it for ya, then smoking certainly should. But you'll have to learn how to properly vaporize it and lower your doses a lot.
</p>

<p>
	You have to experiment to find what your mild, medium, high, and breakthrough dosages are. 4 trials is really not enough in your case.
</p>

<p>
	It would help a lot if you had done other psychedelics and knew your overall tolerance level to stuff like LSD and mushrooms.

<p>
	There is no difference between the screen and all the stuff on the screen.
</p>

<p>
	You can differentiate them if you want but they are simultaneously one.
</p>

<p>
	If you are seeing the screen as one thing and the stuff on the screen as another thing, that is a duality. So just realize they are one.

<title>Is solipsism true?</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	No statement can ever be absolutely true. All statements are dualistic and at best relatively and partially true.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is not a statement or an idea. It is what is actual. The entire actual universe and much more!
</p>

<p>
	Some aspects of solipsism point at one or two facets of the Absolute Truth, but Absolute Truth is way more grand and radical than solipsism would have you believe.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is a much better term than solipsism.
</p>

<p>
	But it is true that you are the only thing that exists. But NOT in the way you imagine.

With enlightenment these are seen through so there is much less need to do evil.
</p>

<p>
	good and evil are transcended into Good with a capital G. Without ego, everything becomes Good, not neutral as you might expect.
</p>

<p>
	Good and evil are not really equal and opposite. In truth there is no such thing as evil, leaving only Good.

<title>Self-Inquiry - Additional tips to find the real emptiness?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/29432-self-inquiry-additional-tips-to-find-the-real-emptiness/?do=findComment&amp;comment=340464</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Yeah, this is the whole trick with self-inquiry: the mind refuses to stay with the emptiness because it needs some image to grasp.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you wrote is the noise of the mind. Look past all that towards the emptiness and just try to observe it without worry or mind noise. This takes lots of practice, focus, and patience.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this is Neti Neti. The emptiness cannot be found in the conventional sense of finding a physical object. Something radically new must click.
</p>

<p>
	What are you beneath all that mind noise and doubt? What is observing the noise? Stay on that with steadiness. Try to keep the mind very calm. You want to hit a silent observer state. Observe observation itself.
</p>

<p>
	You are observation itself. But what is observation?? Don't think the answer -- observe!
</p>

<p>
	You will definitely fall into the trap of intellectualizing emptiness over and over again thousands of times before you learn not to do that.
</p>

<p>
	Remember this is like a live scientific experiment. You are working in the labrabory of your own mind.
</p>

Those are relative.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to fit reality into a cause and effect paradigm is a big obstacle to spiritual understanding.

Everything is 100% relative to the structure of one's nervous system, including the nervous system itself!
</p>

<p>
	Your nervous system restricts your access to what would otherwise be an infinite number of possible "realities" and insights.

You have no idea what will happen after enlightenment. Your whole life could change. Or not. You have to be willing to take that plunge into the unknown, ready to surrender everything, including everyone you love.

	You ain't gonna get it without hardcore spiritual practice or psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Go do a psychedelic retreat. Then you will get it. Because right now you ain't got anywhere close to Truth. You are lost inside a hallucination with no idea of how to escape.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are no joke. They are a crucial tool in the journey for ordinary people. The average person will NEVER grasp the depth of this work without psychedelics. Even people who meditate will still miss the depth of this work.
</p>

<p>
	It is worth your time and effort to do a retreat. Stop being lazy.

<p>
	Eliminate all wheat, rice, potatoes, and refined sugar from your diet and you'll lose weight easily.
</p>

<p>
	Also reduce your meal portion size by 20%-30%. You want to leave the dinner table with a slight feeling of emptiness in your stomach. Never stuff yourself full.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to starve. You can still eat delicious high energy foods like meat, oil, butter, and fat.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make this a diet. Make this a permanent change to how you eat food from now on.

	The stock market is deliberately rigged against you by giant hedge funds with insider information. You are playing a rigged game against the house.

</p>

<p>
	Science and the brain are themselves part of the entire hallucination you call reality.
</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself this: Where is the proof that all of science as a whole is not a hallucination? If the universe is a hallucination, so is science and so are all methods of proof.

	Why would you assume the best should be everywhere? To be everywhere a thing must be the lowest possible common denominator and appeal to mouthbreathing fools.

And when you become directly conscious of that, you will have a much deeper understanding of where the human emotion of love stems from.
</p>

<p>
	This is very advanced stuff. So stay openminded and be ready to investigate the issue.
</p>

<p>
	There is something about love that you do not yet understand. Find what that is. If you dare.

	Do not mix psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	And do not take MDMA regularly. It will permanently ruin your brain chemistry.

	Be careful with get rich quick schemes. They often go bust and leave you worse than you began. Trading stocks and currency is super dangerous. Because fundamentally you aren't offering any value. You are just trying to be a leech. So karma will get you.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	This is why Zen masters do not answer stupid questions. Because the ego-mind will create an infinite supply of them to avoid self-inquiry.

We are not talking about a human emotion here. We are talking about existential love.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as the brain in the Absolute sense. But a donkey does not have the hardware to have an insight about the true nature of existence. Likewise an autistic person may not have the hardware to have an insight about the true nature of love. Or he has the hardware but simply hasn't accessed that insight.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru clearly has a grasp of existential Love. He actually proves my point.

So this is something you (and many others) seem to disagree with him? Or definitions with words just affecting confusion?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, I disagree with Ralston on that point. As do most sages.
</p>

<p>
	My guess about this discrepancy is three-fold:
</p>

<p>
	1) Ralston's style is very austere and cold. That reflects his personality type and brain type. He's described himself in the past as being somewhat autistic. So he might be less connected to love than others. His brain may not give him access to this dimension of reality.
</p>

<p>
	2) If we're talking about the pure Godhead, it is technically unqualifiable. Nothing can be said of it. So calling it "love" would be a qualification which Ralston would not want to assign it. I can appreciate that. But at the same time I have directly experienced that Consciousness = Being = Love.
</p>

<p>
	3) The word "love" can be interpreted in several ways. Sometimes it designates an emotional state. Other times is designates an existential truth. Obviously in this case we're not talking about an emotional state, but an existential truth. So Ralston is right if by love you mean an emotional state. But I think he's wrong in ignoring the existential facet of love. Love with a capital L.
</p>

<p>
	I know many other sages and masters who agree with me that Love is an existential facet of the Absolute. And my own direct experience validates that. It's a bit puzzling that Ralston relegates love to merely an emotional state. Love is existential. It's a fundamental quality of Being.
</p>

<p>
	For me Love is Absolute, not relative. Love is more than just a feeling. It is Unity itself. And Unity is not a feeling.
</p>

<p>
	They are two sides of the same coin. But the ego-mind prefers order because order is necessary for its survival. By the very fact of being alive you must prefer order.

</p>

<p>
	Eventually the awakening "sticks". But there are also various depths of it. Very very few people reach the deepest depths of it. There are depths that even awakened people have not reached.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest depths are totally unimaginable and only attained by tiny handfuls of people.

<p>
	Spirituality does not reject anything. It is nothing other than looking at whatever is true. If something is false it will get revealed as an illusion in the process.

<p>
	Physical and spiritual are actually identical. The physical and spiritual world are one and the same.

		</p>

		<p>
			Don't get that confused with the partitioned consciousness, the small self that is your ego.
		</p>

		<p>
			From there you are one perspective and reality is relative.   You are in a "dream" which is consciousness - so everything in the dream is just that.
		</p>

		<p>
			Your mother is still your mother, but you don't have access FROM YOUR perspective to her consciousness, to her memories, otherwise you would no longer be YOU, and you would be HER.
		</p>

		<p>
			So when these things are discussed we should be careful from which perspective we are talking about.  The absolute, or the part!
		</p>

		<p>
			What happened with Akuma is he got a glimpse of his true self - and it's fucking majestic, beautiful, beyond words, and terrifying at the same time.
		</p>

		<p>

			Then you sync back into your ego and it's like, wtf?

<p>
	Yes, this is the difference between relative and absolute truths.
</p>

<p>
	The more awoke you get, the more relative truths give way to absolute truths.

<p>
	That's because there is more to mastery than merely the realization of no-self or nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to go deeper with your consciousness work and become conscious of what suffering and pain are. Which is NOT the same thing as enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	You can be enlightened, but you do not have total mastery and you are not conscious of everything your body/mind is doing. You are not yet conscious of how you create suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Initial stages of enlightenment are very far from mastery of the mind/body. There's still tons of stuff you ain't conscious of. Hence in practice an awoke newbie will still suffer.

<p>
	For you: it's possible to be enlightened and also still suffer and be depressed, since enlightenment neither guarantees nor precludes a state of any kind.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is none other than Truth. And Truth includes all states, all feelings, all emotions.
</p>

<p>
	Even enlightened masters can get triggered! They are not superhuman robots.
</p>

<p>
	With a deep enough enlightenment there should be no depression.
</p>

<p>
	Depression is mostly the result of improper psychology, not some permanently bad brain chemistry. The bad brain chemistry is mostly caused by improper psychology, diet, and lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
	A practice like Kriya yoga will also rewire your brain and can create ecstatic bliss.

<p>
	Except nihilism is true. Life has no meaning. So by demonizing nihilism you drive people to believe in egoic fairy tales.
</p>

<p>
	There is no enlightenment without facing nihilism. Hence the Dark Night Of The Soul.
</p>

<p>
	The saddest part of all this is that by rejecting nihilism JP is preventing himself from realizing God.

So let's stop the culture wars that JP and Fox News are waging.
</p>

<p>
	Let's stop saying the words "post-modernism", "marxism", "socialism", "feminism", "relativism", "equality", "LGBTQ", and "nihilism" as if they are bad and dangerous things.
</p>

<title>How to Be a Strategic Motherfucker for Life Purpose?</title>

<p>
	In practice most people will need to take several stepping stones before getting to their ultimate life purpose. I spent about 3 years building a business I hated in order to become financially independent enough to start my dream business.
</p>

<p>
	That's what being a strategic motherfucker means. Most people never think that far ahead, and so their life reflects that.
</p>

<p>
	Most people will not be able to start their dream career right off the bat because there are real-world financial and other limitations. Meaning you gotta plan and work towards it. Build skills, save money, develop social connections, etc.

</p>

<p>
	The highest tax rate has been slashed from 90% to 45%. Corporate tax rates are absurdly low and full of loopholes. Income inequlity has skyrocketed. Average worker wages have stagnated for 30 years. CEO pay has skyrocketed. Money in politics has skyrocketed. Corporate power and lobbying has skyrocketed. Unions have been almost eliminated. Stock buy-backs are legal again. Many industries have been deregulated. Social security and medicare are under attack and would be eliminated if conservatives got their way. Healthcare costs are out of control. The drug war is out of control. Environmental regulations are being dismantled. Public education is being dismantled. Military spending is out of control. Disaster capitalism is rampant. The Republican party has lost all sense of decency, integrity, and truthfulness. Right wing propaganda channels like Fox News and Brietbart are disinforming the populace.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that the world faces newer, more complex problems than in the 1960's, which demands much greener solutions.
</p>

<p>
	See Noam Chomsky's analysis of the situation.
</p>

<p>
	If income inequality continues at this rate the entire US economy could collapse. Yet here we are talking about a few radical feminist college students who grind JP's gears.

</p>

<p>
	I have some fond memories of fighting to escape wage slavery. It was tough but also fun.
</p>

<p>
	And remember, freedom isn't all good. Too much freedom comes with its own problems.

A diamond in the rough which you must now polish. Follow those breadcrumbs and something juicy should materialize in the end. Leave some room for improvisation and innovation in your plan. So you're not being a copycat but doing something new.

</p>

<p>
	Of course hardcore spiritual practice will increase odds of developing psychic abilities by 100 fold. But still doesn't mean you will get them.
</p>

<p>
	Om Swami is a hardcore monk beast. Results not typical (as they say).
</p>

<p>
	Intense Kriya Yoga is the best way I know to unlock psychic abilities. Years of it.

<p>
	This is all a problem of low self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
	Do 1 year of Nathaniel Branden's self-esteem exercises from his books. That's the solution.
</p>

<p>
	Also more self-love. Watch some of Matt Kahn's self-love videos. She's all about helping women with low self-esteem. You gotta learn to love yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can help you realize how beautiful you are. You are literally a Goddess after all! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> I never love myself more than when I'm on a psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	What your ego is trying to get from you bf is pseudo-love. And it will never work. Never! You will always be left feeling incomplete. You must have a spiritual awakening to the fact that YOU ARE LOVE! Give yourself the love you want him to give you. It's very counter-intuitive.
</p>

<p>
	It's impossible to not be beautiful when you realize you are the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	And by completing all the above your bf will respect and love you more. But it won't even matter at that point because you will already have loved yourself.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is the solution.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics could help you see the good and love again. She's not really gone. She and you are one forever. Maybe try some MDMA, 5-MeO-DMT, or mushrooms so you can realize this directly. They will reconnect you with divine love and oneness and help you deal with any emotional baggage that remains.
</p>

<p>
	Also remember that a grieving process is totally normal. Especially this early into it. Don't avoid the grieving, rather go more fully into it. Explore it. Rather than trying to be all "spiritual" and stoic, dive into the feeling! Feel deeper!
</p>

<p>
	And be gentle with yourself. Don't forget to love yourself.
</p>

Why not just start the relationship and see how it goes? It's not marriage. It's just a relationship. It might work, it might not.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of women is to get into relationships with them! The sex gets 100x better. The relationship is fun and rewarding.
</p>

<p>
	You were born ready. Just do it. It will be a growing experience. Do not wait for "the perfect one". Ain't no such thing. Learn to love who she is, as she is -- not as some fantasy you imagined.
</p>

<title>Fantasy of men taking advantage</title>

How did you get love/approval from him, or lack there of? That might hold a clue.
</p>

<p>
	But also rape fantasies for women are totally natural and I would say even healthy so long as you're doing it playfully with your man.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between being turned on by that kind of behavior vs actually allowing yourself to be abused by someone you're intimate with. People get turned on by all sorts of weird stuff and it's not necessarily a problem as long as you understand that it's a fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Low self-esteem is also a huge issue for women who get abused by men. Probably the #1 cause. A man will only respect you as much as you respect yourself. You can raise self-esteem through Nathaniel Branden's work.
</p>

<p>
	Don't stop, just switch up your visualization/affirmation to something else. Awareness is best handled by meditation. But there are many other things you could visualize which meditation cannot give you.

</p>

<p>
	But Green is capable of killing people, just like any stage is. Especially when things get political. Political leaders have to make many tough choices which usually involve the death of people.
</p>

<p>
	Take a look at what happened in Osho's ashram. They almost killed people even though their culture was very Green.

There are no guarantees but hardcore yogic practices are probably the best way. Most people will not get them.
</p>

<p>
	Psychics usually show signs of their abilities early in life when they are still kids.

<title>Is Enlightenment the end of all Anxiety/Depression?</title>

<p>
	Yes, enlightenment should put an end to that.
</p>

<p>
	But practically speaking you probably won't attain enlightenment without first conquering your OCD. It's a two-way street.
</p>

<p>
	You must become conscious of what your fear and sadness is, along with what you are. It's all interconnected at rock bottom. Fear and depression and ego is all one thing. One giant self-sustaining illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are great for this.
</p>

<p>
	Our society has been going right for 50+ years.
</p>

<p>
	There is no serious discussion with JP because he does not understand feminism, post-modernism, relativism, socialism, morality, developmental psychology, or spirituality. He is not helping his audience understand these complex and nuanced topics.
</p>

<p>
	I'm willing to bet good money that no JP fan has ever read a single feminist or post-modernist book. So this isn't a discussion so much as it's bigotry.
</p>

<p>
	JP himself is pretty well-read. But his audience is not. So it turns in turns into a one-eyed man leading the blind off a cliff.
</p>

<p>
	But don't take my word for it. Discover for yourself.

<p>
	Penrose is great stage Yellowish scientist. But he lacks direct nondual experience. He's about where Albert Einstein and the fathers of quantum mechanics were. But that's still not high enough to really understand what consciousness is. So close yet so far.

He just creates a straw man out of Green. JP has a Green shadow. He is denying Green, judging it, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I have posted examples of this on my blog in the past. Like this doozy of ignorance:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LquIQisaZFU?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	But you see, he doesn't need to be hateful. All he needs to do is create this judgmental ideology, this straw man, and poison the well, and the alt-right will do the rest for him. He's a gateway into the alt-right. He himself will never say anything hateful, but his philosophy will give aid and comfort to xenophobia, Islamophobia, racism, misogyny, homophobia, transphobia, socialism-phobia, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's basically like Fox News. They are never directly hateful per se, but they create toxic propaganda which keeps many people in ignorance and ultimately bolsters judgment and hatred.
</p>

<p>
	The dangerous person teaching your kids is JP. Lol.
</p>
