<p>
	Don't frame it like that.
</p>

<p>
	You are just holding back your raging neediness and being a cool, chill guy.
</p>

<p>
	There are certain unspoken protocols to dating and attraction. It's like a mating dance. You must dance in a certain way or you mess it up. You would never text the girl, "Hey, let's bang", even if you two both want it, because that breaks the protocols of the dance. You must proceed slowly and not just dump all your cards on the table. She doesn't want that. She wants you to attract her in a smooth and natural manner so she doesn't feel like a slut. And you must demonstrate to her that you're a high value guy. And a high value guy never professes his spiritual love for a girl he hasn't even slept with.
</p>

			Hope you won't betray your nature doing that. People are attracted to your style because it is unique, direct, honest and in your face. Make sure that what makes you unique does not disappear for the sake of attracting more viewers <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />

<p>
	It will be a delicate balancing act. I'm not making these changes to attract more viewers, but to give the work a higher caliber image for existing and future viewers. In the past I didn't think the image of the work mattered so much, but now I realize that casual attitude cannot hold up in the future as we grow. It needs to feel more professional.
</p>

<p>
	I think I can tone it down without losing the directness, honesty, and in-your-faceness. I want to be direct without being offensive or obnoxious, which I sometimes come off as. It will take me some practice to find the right balance. It should be subtle.

<p>
	So, after considering the situation, I've decided to retract my dating post because I see people getting resentful and this undermines the focus of my teachings, which is more important to me than dating. People will try to use this to demonize my teachings in the future, which I don't want to have to deal with as I get enough of that already.
</p>

<p>
	For those who supported me, thanks and I appreciate your support. But I have to learn to be more careful with image issues and political correctness going forward because the pressures will become great to demonize my teachings as Actualized.org grows in size and naturally develops more enemies who will misconstrue everything I say in order to invalidate the work. This is something I have to think about more seriously going forward because really these teachings should be as little about me as possible. Ideally I want to take my personal self out of the teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry, my mistake. Party's over folks.
</p>

<p>
	In the future I will be making further changes to my style and manner of delivery in order to make the teachings more selfless and tactful. The days where Actualized.org could be the wild west are coming to an end. As the size grows, image issues become more serious and important. This seems to be the nature of politics and public relations that I don't have much experience with. I am still learning to navigate these waters because my natural style is blunt and politically incorrect. I notice that I have to be much more careful and responsible as more people watch my content in ways that were not normal for me in the early days. I am looking forward to cleaning up my presentation so that it is more selfless and then you don't have worry so much about your friends saying that you are following a cult leader. Although of course that will be said no matter what due to the nature of the material we study.
</p>

<p>
	I apologize for not being more forward-thinking about these issues.
</p>

<p>
	One of the things I also plan to do in the future is clean up my language and stop dropping f-bombs. I've been thinking of doing that for some time now, and this situation will hasten that. I have been seeing for a while now that these changes will be necessary for what Actualized.org is to become in the future. My style needs to mature to reflect the gravity of the work. I will also hold myself to a higher standard as a role-model, because even though I don't particularly want to be one, people will treat me like one regardless and it is my responsibility to take that one as part of delivering these teachings. It just comes with the job.
</p>

	You don't know shit, son.
</p>

<p>
	Listen to the wisdom of a 1000 rejections.
</p>

<p>
	Forget about love for a month. This is not the place for it. Attraction is what you have for her. You are desperate to be with her.
</p>

<p>
	Doesn't matter if she approached you. You need to cool down by 1000%. If it's true she approached you, then you can play it real cool and easy. Keep your texts short and lite. No walls of text. Nothing serious. Use texts to set up an evening coffee date. Keep all texts short and playful.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can self-actualize and learn a lot, but at some point you will probably outgrow that job and want to find something more refined.

	OMG no!
</p>

<p>
	For the love of God, stop treating this girl like a princess. Do not try anything deep or spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	Text her: "Hey dork"
</p>

<p>
	NO SPECIAL CONNECTION! NO LOVE!
</p>

<p>
	You are needy as fuck and she will instantlyÂ reject you.
</p>

<p>
	You need to play it cool, like you don't care about her at all. You must be the prize, not her. As soon as she feels that you think she is the prize, you will lose her.

<p>
	Certainly there will be challenges there. You are dealing with stage Orange men who will be very masculine in their attitude and probably will not take you seriously unless you kick some ass and grab some balls.
</p>

<p>
	You should seek out a woman in corporate for better advice.

Girls don't like to hurt your feelings so it's easier for them to say that compared to something like "i don't find you attractive".Â

<p>
	Let's say she was just being nice, then she rejected me for my looks, which is even worse.
</p>

<p>
	But in that specific case, she literally looked at me, took my necklace in her hand, and said, "Ewww... I don't like this. Go away."
</p>

<p>
	And I've had girls not return my texts even after we slept together. Fucking cold.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Welcome to reality.
</p>

<p>
	You know, it's not like us men sat downÂ and decided one day: we will be attracted to X but not Y. Attraction is not a choice.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: why aren't youÂ attracted to a gorilla? When you get to the bottom of that one, you may understand why not everyone is attracted to you.
</p>

<p>
	No one likes being rejected for any aspect of themselves, flesh or otherwise. Rejection always hurts. And women reject men all the time over the most superficial things. I've had women reject me because of the necklace I wore. I've had women punch me in the mouth and I couldn't hit her back.
</p>

<p>
	That's life. You suck it up.
</p>

<p>
	I have literally been rejected 1000s of times. Some nights I'd go home and cry. It's good for the ego. Makes you stronger. Teaches you not to care what people think.
</p>

<p>
	I am suggesting dating is a survival game and honesty was never its goal.
</p>

<p>
	I like being honest about what dating is. So as not to fool ourselves with stories about it.
</p>

<p>
	None of this means you can't have a decent relationship. Just understand that both sides are playing games. And that's okay. Life is an interplay and life is sneaky.

<p>
	Pickup works of course, but:
</p>

<p>
	A) I don't really enjoy clubs and bars. I did that earlier in my life because it forced me to grow. I would rather be meditating. Chasing girls is not so appealing to me since my time is valuable. I am not a social person by temperment. I can be happy living in a cave. And one day I may just completely leave society behind and you may never hear from me again.

<p>

<p>
	It depends a lot on the level of development of the people you commune with. If they are low in development, stage Red or Orange, they will preceive nice as too weak to survive.
</p>

<p>
	Nice gets appreciated and valued at stage Green and above.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you try to be nice in prison, it will backfire.

You gotta be very clever and intelligent about it. You gotta be like a fox.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that all of reality runs on cleverness. Brute force approaches are not smart enough to solve the deep problems.
</p>

<p>
	The problem you're facing is a lack of requisite variety (a cybernetics term). See my blog post video on Requisite Variety. It will explain everything.

<p>
	What I do is I take hour-long drives to nowhere late at night and just contemplate/integrate whatever ideas are in my mind that day while I drive. Not so good for global warning, but amazing for my clarity of mind.

			Especially while you're pretending to teach conscious dating and relationships among the things you teach.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You realize that what I posted is actually conscious and honest? I posted my dating intentions honestly without any games.
</p>

<p>
	Any other alternative will be more dishonest and manipulative. The problem is that people are so used to playing games with dating that when someone does it directly and honestly they are shocked.
</p>

<p>
	Usually all dating is done in secret so that none of your people know your true intentions. This is safe for the ego and lets you get away with a lot more manipulation.
</p>

<p>
	With dating and sexuality in particular, people are often outraged and shocked when the mechanics of the game are laid bare before their eyes. As if the mechanics were not present before looking.
</p>

<p>
	Hiding your intentions does not make your dating any more conscious or honest. And really, dating is never a function of honesty. It is dishonest to suggest that dating is honest. That is not its function. It's an illusion and a game that both sides are playing while trying to pretend like that isn't so.
</p>

<p>
	You can cry about how unfair it all is, but the reality is, when you acquire your dates -- however you acquire them, online or offline -- you are still playing this game.
</p>

<p>
	If I truly wanted to be dishonest and manipulative, I could easily have done that a long time ago and gotten laid a 100x over. My position can basically get me unlimited sex for a lifetime. I could push that button any time. And I basically never do because I have some integrity. But that doesn't mean I'm disinterested in finding a romantic partner. I am. That's honest. And that's okay.
</p>

<p>
	You can judge it of course. But if you really care about honesty so much, I invite you to contemplate the double-standard of how you acquire your dates. You may find that your method is less honest than mine. Consider all the social circle games you play.
</p>

<p>
	Dude, when you date, you don't get all philosophical about it. You keep things fun and easy. Don't start whipping out actualized.org lectures on your date. You relate on a much shallower level.
</p>

<p>
	On your profile you could mention that you're into spirituality and meditation. That should pique some girls' interests. The smart girls. Girls love spirituality stuff. It's like chick-crack.
</p>

<p>
	If I'm socializing with a girl, I act like a total goofball. It's not serious. Stop saying anything logical. This is the #1 rule of game. No logic.

<p>
	Your logic is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	The risks of mutation are higher when we don't get vaccinated. Letting a virus just run loose through the population will result in more mutations and even more dangerous strains.

If what you want is a honest guy, screen him for it early on.
</p>

<p>
	Honesty is a character trait. Some people have it, some don't. Train yourself to be a good judge of character.

</p>

<p>
	You'd be surprised. You can meet conscious and openminded people in clubs and bars. Girls of all kinds go to clubs and bars for fun with their friends. There is this false idea that only sluts or skanks go to clubs. That's not true. I've met some amazing people. One of the most amazing things you'll discover when you go out a lot is that you will bump into the most surprising people. I once bumped into Tony Robbin's copywriter and she went on a date with me. We had some amazing conversations and she was all into self-help and stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically, it is closedminded to believe that openminded people don't go to clubs.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, I've never really enjoyed clubbing. It's something I did to grow myself, but it's not an environment I want to be in if I can avoid it.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, I once met a stripper with a Om tattoo and she liked to smoke DMT and was into yoga. People are more interesting and complex than you expect.
</p>

<p>
	As far as finding a high caliber match, that's basically luck. The more numbers you get the better your chances. You can't really predict it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Wherever your paycheck comes from, you do the same thing. You sell something for profit so that you could feed yourself. And you better understand that enlightened gurus are not above selling you shit. Because survival requires money.

</p>

<p>
	The whole point of a Buddha is that he don't give a fuck if he dies tomorrow because his enlightenment already killed him.
</p>

<p>
	Why would survival be automatically taken care of? What fantasy world are you living in? If the Buddha does not brush his teeth, his teeth will fall out.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to escape survival is to stop caring about it. But that does not at all guarantee you will survive. But luckily if you did part 1, you no longer care about part 2.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is radical stuff.

If it wasn't, it would have already been done, and there would be no value in doing it.
</p>

<p>
	Improving society is always H-A-R-D for this reason. This is why society evolves inch by inch, tooth by tooth, claw by claw.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a hero to push new ideas through to mass acceptance.

<p>
	Depends on how you're defining "nice". If by nice you mean a meek door-mat with low self-esteem who can't stand up for herself, then yeah, people will have less respect for you because you let them push you around. People tend to be exploitative. If they see an opportunity to exploit you and you just let them get away with it, then they will usually do it. It's just how humans are wired for survival's sake.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to set boundaries and not be afraid to enforce them. Once people see you enforcing your boundaries they will stop trying to exploit you because they know you're not the kind of person who stomachs their BS.
</p>

<p>
	That's a tall order to fill. Not just for a man, but for any human.
</p>

<p>
	What you're asking for is a highly developed, conscious, selfless man. Which is gonna be as rare as a highly developed, conscious, selfless woman. Basically, you want to be date God <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	See... on the one hand you want a man who not manipulative, yet on the other hand you want a man who's really good at survival and a provider. These two things are inversely related. A "strong" man is often the most manipulative and deceptive. That's how he gets his strength in a low-consciousness society. And a weak man is probably not gonna make you wet. So it's a delicate balancing act.
</p>

<p>
	And here's the ultimate kicker: if you ever sleep with a man who's that God-like, and if you ever break up with him, it will be the most painful, heartbreaking event of your life. Because you know you'll probably never meet someone that good again. So be careful what you wish for. Just because a man is good or Godly does not guarantee he will not break up with you at some point for any number of legit reasons which have nothing to do with him cheating or being an asshole.
</p>

<p>
	There is a deeper problem you're hitting up against here, which is this: every great thing comes to an end, and the greater the thing is, the sadder its end will be. You can't escape this. This is the existential suffering that the Buddha taught. Relationships are bound to be painful. There is no such thing as a perfect relationship without any pain. Relationships are like a rollercoaster, so enjoy the thrill while it lasts.
</p>

<p>
	The better the man, the bigger the problem.
</p>

<p>
	Any kind of attachment will necessarily create suffering. Such is life.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, that's called Primordial Avoidance.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is terrified of realizing it's own emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	The thing looking through your eyes is Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	You are Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	How can you continue? As you slowly chip away at it, you'll get more comfortable looking inward and eventually the resistance will melt away with only Infinity remaining. This chipping away process can take a few years. Gently keep at it. If it gets too emotionally tough, take a brief break and then return to it a few days later.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, Self-Love is key here. Don't force yourself too much. Comfort yourself with Self-Love when the going gets tough.
</p>

	Tons of practical possibilities here: researcher, scholar, teacher, philosopher, author, historian, academic, research assistant, podcaster, interviewer, youtuber, public speaker, public intellectual, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Not so hard to see practical ways of utilizing your strength.

<p>
	Brand new categories of thing usually flop business-wise because they are too unorthodox, no one sees the value of them, and the first few editions of it are too unpolished for mass-market success.
</p>

<p>
	Which is exactly what happened with the early tablets and mp3 players.
</p>

<p>
	Polishing a turd is what Apple does well.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to us humans. The first humanoid creatures were not so great. It took many iterations for evolution to finally arrive at homo sapiens and then we took over the whole world.

But innovation is important.
</p>

<p>
	You're confusing innovation with "creating a brand new thing". But most innovation is minor and evolutionary.

Everywhere you look things could be better designed, improved, or made more efficient. Survival problems lurk everywhere. All you have to do is find one good solution to a survival problem and you're in business.
</p>

<p>
	You need to develop the mind of an entrepreneur who is constantly looking at how the world can be improved.
</p>

<p>
	Every time I buy a product I look at it and see ways it could have been made better. When you start looking at the world like this you will soon have more business ideas than years left in your life.
</p>

<p>
	Just an example to inspire you:
</p>

<p>
	One time I was eating a rotisserie chicken. I noticed how its crispy wings were the tastiest part. They were perfectly crunchy, unlike any chicken wings I've had before. I wanted more! So I wondered, why doesn't somebody just sell rotisserie chicken wings? They'd be a huge hit! So I got the idea of starting a chicken wings fast-food chain that only sells crispy rotisserie chicken wings and various dipping sauces. Then I started researching how to launch a fast food restaurant. I even bought a couple of books on it.
</p>

<p>
	That was like 8 years ago. But it was an idea outside my zone of genius so I let it go. To this day I feel that if someone started a simple rotisserie chicken wing fast food chain it would become the next Chipotle. You would make a billion dollars with that one idea.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If you make a billion dollars with this idea, please send me a check for 10% <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	Sounds like your technique is very noob.
</p>

<p>
	Having the best profile pics is EVERYTHING in online dating. You must hire a professional photographer to take your pics, not some selfie bullshit. Pay a pro $500. Get really good casual pics of yourself. And you need some pics of you being social, not just a loner.
</p>

<p>
	And yes, you text game sounds like it sucks too. Takes lots of practice to get it just right.
</p>

<p>
	Key practicing. These things require lots of failure before success.

<p>
	That's one strategy. But don't be surprised ifÂ that isn't enough. You may not be able to make your product so innovative. That innovation can cost more than advertizing. And I'm not necessarilyÂ saying advertizing is the solution. Marketing is a much bigger thing than running ads.

</p>

<p>
	Then you can get to work building that future.

<p>

Look, the most important thing to do when you're in this kind of funk is to take back control of your mind. Your mind is spinning all those of negative stories about the future which is making you feel hopeless. You must take back control of your mind by every day visualizing yourself in a good place in the future. You may be going through some bad life conditions right now, but always you must keep a hopeful and exciting vision of the future. This has to be done proactively, not passively. Every day, spend at least 20 minutes sitting on the couch visualizing a great life for yourself regardless of how you feel or what your limiting belief. This is your medicine. Start doing it.
</p>

<p>
	When your mind starts imagining negative shit, you must stop it and start imaging positive stuff.
</p>

	That's a deep topic.

<p>
	If you're serious, you should spend the next 5 years contemplating and studying all the points I made in the videos. This is not something you just follow a list of bullet points on. You must think profoundly about these epistemic issues as you go about learning and doing science.
</p>

<p>
	No one is gonna hold your hand towards groundbreaking, genius-level science. That's your job to figure out and then convince the world of your discoveries. People will not like your discoveries.

<p>
	Of course followers are necessary, and that's not a problem because most people are happy being sheep.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why most people are wage slaves and tolerate being so -- they are not strong enough to lead themselves or others. Of course there are also systemic inequality problems which are inherent to capitalism.

<p>
	"Wage slavery" is actually a technical term from Marxism.
</p>

<p>
	But I use the term rather loosely. To me it's any job where you don't have much creative autonomy and your paycheck is capped by your boss rather than your creative output.
</p>

<p>
	The point of wage slavery in Marxism is that your boss is not giving you the full value of your work. You don't get to own the work you produce.
</p>

<p>
	See, with Actualized.org, all the work I do I own. Not so with a wage slave job. If I was creating these videos for some boss, he would own all my work and he would reap all the profits while I would get pennies.

<p>
	It is a genuine fear. Don't try to avoid it, just bask in it and appreciate the gravity of the situation. You're still very young and you have many options, so don't feel bad. Escaping wage slavery is a serious long-term project. You must approach it with patience and careful strategy.
</p>

<p>
	Also, it's not gonna kill ya to work a bit in the wage market just to get a feel for how things work. There are lessons to be learned there. Good jobs do exist. If you get a job within your field of passion, then it's not so bad. And this in fact might be necessary for you to build a decent experience base before venturing off on your own. It's hard to survive on your own. You gotta really know what you're doing. This usually takes years of experience and skill.

	Your biggest issue is gonna be figuring out how to market your services and attract paying clients.
</p>

<p>
	If you've never run a biz before it can be extra challenging to market spirituality. It's much easier to market more material things.

<p>

<p>
	That's the whole point! Nothing is stopping your mind from inventing whatever stories and excuses convenient to it.
</p>

<p>
	But haven't you noticed? That is exactly what you are doing every day of your life right now!
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of Goodness is that it is uncoerced. Nothing stops a good person from killing another person and rationalizing it away. So when he chooses not to do that, that is what makes himÂ good. If he was forced to be good, goodness would be worthless.
</p>

<p>
	What you fail to appreciate is that rationality is precisely the function of the mind which is used to justify every evil ever committed by man. Rationality does not and cannot lead to Goodness. Rationality is whore to the devil.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing at all is stopping you from being Hitler. Go for it if you want. God will not judge you or hold it against you. Not even a little bit.
</p>

<p>
	But your fellow men, who are devils, might not treat you so kindly. You reap what you sow.Â <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

	Self-Love is a grand thing, it includes within it all material needs too.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a material problem, like a broken leg, you must solve it atÂ the material level, by getting a cast. And that IS Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	It is a mistake to try to solve all material problems at the spiritual level. If your child is hungry, give him food. And that is Love.
</p>

<title>Observations on Love vs love</title>

<p>
	Yeah, that's life in a nutshell. On the one hand you want to be selfless, on the other hand you cannot because it would kill you. So you're stuck somewhere in the middle.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing capable of truly unconditional Love is Infinite Consciousness. Anything less will be a lesser manifestation of love. Form and finitude itself limits Love.

<p>
	Simply realize that having things does not actually make you happy.
</p>

<p>
	You have a bunch of stuff, yet you are still unhappy, and that will always be the case no matter how much more stuff you get.

	Yes, of course. But also, don't use this as a ego-trick to stop your spiritual work. Customize the work and the path to yourself. But you can still use teachers and teachings to guide you. Just don't get too attached to the teachings. And yes, honor your own intuitions.

<p>
	Taking it once per day or in large doses will not create detoxification, it will merely redistribute toxins deeper into your organs and brain. It's the opposite of detox.
</p>

<p>
	To detox with ALA requires taking it every 3 hours for 3 days straight, including at night while you sleep.

<p>
	All of neoliberalism and the economic platform of the corporate capitalist DNC.
</p>

<p>
	Capitalism needs serious reforms and structural changes, not just tinkering around edges as Biden plans to do.
</p>

<p>
	We don't necessarily have to go full-socialist, but capitalism needs serious systemic reforms. Right now Neolibs are in denial about the structural problems of capitalism. They pretend as though no structural problems exist. This is a stage Orange disaster.

	ALA is not a supplement you should ever take unless you are doing a strict detox protocol. ALA will shift heavy metals around in your body and make things worse if you take it as a supplement.

<p>
	Green likes to go too far on social and cultural issues. Orange likes to not go far enough on economic issues.

	Every decision in life comes with risks.

<p>
	Strategy is about making wise decisions with imperfect knowledge and no guarantees of success.

<p>
	You are exhibiting poor strategy, which could end up killing millions of people. Which is why people like you should not occupy positions of power and responsibility.

	But it's not the same compound. It's not the same purity. And there are many more synthetic chems than anything natural.

</p>

<p>
	The rest is just execution. Start reading books and researching online for courses, programs, trainings, seminars, etc. You will figure it out. You've got plenty of time. You don't need to have all the answers given to you right now. You will figure out all the technical details along the way. What's most important is that you have a clear direction in mind and that you chip away at it every day for months and years.
</p>

<p>
	Spend a couple of years just doing a bunch of online research about business and entrepreneurship. Sign up to some business magazines and slowly, every month you will get new ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get me wrong, your life can become a lot better if you are stuck in depression. You don't have to keep being depressed forever.
</p>

<p>
	Many severe negative emotional states you can learn to outgrow and just drop. In this way your life will feel much better.

	This is downright stupid. You should not be doing research chems at all with this attitude.
</p>

<p>
	You must test everything carefully and slowly. Like your life depends on it. Because it does.

<p>
	I wouldn't hope on life getting easier. If you are growing properly, life will always present you with greater and greater challenges.
</p>

<p>
	Life becomes less dysfunctional though, and less about raw survival and the associated negative emotions.
</p>

<p>
	If you become financially independent and secure thanks to your LP, that does take a huge survival load off your shoulders. But life can still be hard. 2020 was one of the hardest years of my life thanks to unforeseen health problems. No amount of success or money or even spiritual work will save you when you have the right kind of health problem.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking though, life is a hamster running endlessly in a wheel until it dies of exhaustion. You are the hamster, and no matter how much success you achieve you ultimately get nowhere. Because there's nowhere else to be. This is one of the biggest things spirituality teaches you. Be. Here. Now. This. Is. It.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't be happy now, you never will be.
</p>

<p>
	If we don't the global economy will be dead for a decade to come.
</p>

<p>
	Vaccine is the only thing that will save the economy at this point.
</p>

<p>
	You can cry all you want about the dangers of vaccines, but consider the dangers of a 10-year global Great Depression with 30% unemployment and 50% of businesses closed forever.
</p>

<p>
	The choice is yours. Choose wisely.

	There is nothing wrong with shitting where you eat.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is when you shit where you eat and then you complain about the taste.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing judgmental or egotistical about pointing out that mankind tends to shit where it eats and then loves to cry about it as though some great evil was cast upon mankind by God.
</p>

<p>
	Don't shit where you eat and then you won't need to cry or blame God.

<p>
	Most of mankind's problems are self-created.

<p>
	No other way, brother. This game involves some risk. If you can't handle the fire, get out of the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
	If it is 5-MeO-MIPT or 5-MeO-DALT or something similar in the 5-MeO category, you will generally have a profound experience and it will not harm you.
</p>

<p>
	The only real danger with research chems is if they send you something totally not a tryptamine. And usually the only reason that would happen is if they make a serious mistake in labeling. No tryptamine is gonna kill ya. Worst you'll get is a bad trip.
</p>

<p>
	I would stay away from 5-MeO-DPT though, it's a nasty one.

<p>
	Your problem is not what you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with serious personal development is that you must resolve problems at new levels of consciousness, not within the same old paradigms.
</p>

<p>
	Here's your real problem: you've selected a zero-sum career. Your success essentially requires stealing money from others and having them lose money. Your career entirely hinges on competition, so of course you will be fearful of being out-competed because that's exactly what happens in a competition paradigm. There is always someone better than you who will eat your lunch. Always. You're playing a game you can't really win, and that's not satisfying. And naturally it comes with fear of being beaten. Because you will be.
</p>

<p>
	The solution here is radical: change your entire entire paradigm to non-zero-sum. Make your career about creativity and value-generation rather than leeching value from other humans. This way you will have little to fear because your success will only be limited by personal creative effort and energy.
</p>

<p>
	I've done business in the zero-sum competitive paradigm before and it sucks compared to the non-zero-sum creative paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Do you see what I mean about solving problems at new levels of consciousness? The problem is always deeper and more meta than you first imagine.
</p>

<p>
	You are lucky to have the success you'd had thus far. I would save up money and plan a transition to a truly creative and value-offering career. Not just a career but a life purpose. You have no idea how much of your creative potential and intelligence you are wasting on leeching money from other humans. You could be doing so much more with your life. But of course, you're afraid to move on. << That's where the true fear of failure and success arises. Not in playing poker better, but in moving on to something truly creative beyond poker. Something that will demand much more of your heart and soul.
</p>

<p>
	When you die, on your tombstone do you want it to be written: "This guy spent his whole life clicking on an LCD screen to leech money from others because he was too sacred to do something truly creative and profound with his life."
</p>

<p>
	One of the core Buddhist precepts is "right livelihood".
</p>

<p>
	Using meditation and yoga to leech money from others is a perversion of these holy practices.
</p>

<p>
	Think about it.
</p>

<p>
	If you're serious about growing in this area, take my Life Purpose Course which explains all this and much more in great detail.
</p>

<p>
	That will reveal their lack of understanding of Spiral Dynamics. So let's see the quality of what people post. If people are mostly posting unhealthy toxic cartoonish stuff, then they're failing the test.

<p>
	Men and women are equally selective with their mating. The selection criteria is very different for both sides, but the pressure to be selective is of equal force for both, just in different ways. You will understand this when you fully step outside your gender's survival biases and look at the situation objectively.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you did a careful study of lions, you would see that male lions and female lions are both equally selective of their mates, but in different ways. It's easier to see in lions because you're not a lion, so there's no conflict of interest problem or self-bias clouding your view.

<p>
	Here's a fun way of learning Spiral Dynamics: try to play-act the role of any given stage, like a good actor. And really feel that stage's worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Example: How would stage Blue see gay people? Imagine it! Adopt the Blue perspective on homosexuality as if it was your own.
</p>

<p>
	So.... "Homosexuality is against God's will as written in the Bible. It is deviant behavior which will condemn a soul to hell unless it repents and asks for forgiveness. Therefore to legalize gay marriage is for our society to sanction sin and evil. If God sees too many of us descend into sin and the rest of us cave in to this depravity and debauchery without speaking out for righteousness, then our whole society will be forsaken by God. Therefore it is everyone's duty to call out sinfulness whenever it is seen and to fight against it. So we must either help these sinners get on the righteous path to God, or if they refuse, we must cast them out of our society so they don't corrupt our children and rip apart the fabric of our righteous society. Just because a few men on the Supreme Court think gay marriage is Constitutional does not matter because ultimately it's still a sin. The US Constitution is secondary to the will of God. A sin which is 'Constitutional' is still a sin and we should not support it because being righteous is more important than following some human-made law which changes with the wind. For these reasons we should obviously also not allow gay people to adopt kids, teach kids in schools, or kiss in public."
</p>

<p>
	You see the idea.
</p>

<p>
	Now give it a shot.
</p>

<p>
	The exercise only works if you really are able to look at the world through another set of eyes besides your own.
</p>

<p>
	So, I invite you guys to try it out. Post your results here. You can do this for a range of topics, not just homosexuality. And you can do it from all the Spiral stages: Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow, Turquoise
</p>

<p>
	Here are some topics to jog your mind:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Homosexuality
	</li>
	<li>
		Transgender people
	</li>
	<li>
		Gender is a social construct
	</li>
	<li>
		Trump
	</li>
	<li>
		Obama
	</li>
	<li>
		Global warming
	</li>
	<li>
		Abortion
	</li>
	<li>
		Gun control
	</li>
	<li>
		Capitalism
	</li>
	<li>
		Socialism
	</li>
	<li>
		Racism
	</li>
	<li>
		Sex education
	</li>
	<li>
		War
	</li>
	<li>
		Pickup
	</li>
	<li>
		Cancel culture
	</li>
	<li>
		God
	</li>
	<li>
		New Age teachings
	</li>
	<li>
		Relativism
	</li>
	<li>
		Post-modernism
	</li>
	<li>
		Jordan Peterson
	</li>
	<li>
		Sam Harris
	</li>
	<li>
		Atheism
	</li>
	<li>
		And many more
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If you decide to give it a shot, be creative with your post and tell us which color and which topic you are writing about. If you're doing this, the key here is to steel-man rather than strawman whichever stage you select. Make the stage seem rational, plausible, truthful, and good -- because each stages sees itself that way.
</p>

<p>
	And most importantly, as you type out your reply, notice how it feels to speak and think from within that particular worldview. Feel how your mind is forced to shift from your native way of seeing the world. Notice the relativity of all worldviews.
</p>

<p>
	What you must realize is: THAT is ego!
</p>

<p>
	Self-denial, being a doormat for others, people-pleasing, putting on a fake front of selflessness, trying to be a good boy or girl << ALL of that is ego. This is the ego playing the role of the selfless saint.
</p>

<p>
	This is not true selflessness. It's ego aping selfless behavior, which is actually very selfish and problematic.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that is ego, but it's a better, more honest, more developed form of ego than what you were doing before.
</p>

<p>
	The trap you've fallen into is that you've adopted the selfless saint ego while in your mind harshly judging normal healthy ego which needed fro satisfying basic survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	Life requires that you satisfy your needs within reason in healthy ways and don't act with fake selflessness. When you try to act and pretend as though you don't have needs but really you do have needs, this becomes a big problem because it is untrue and dishonest. You are being dishonest with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It is much healthier to say, "I'm horny and I need sex" than it is to say, "I'm so pure I don't need that dirty thing called sex", but then secretly you have sexual fantasies all the time. In this case the more developed and healthier form of ego is to just be honest and admit: "I need sex. I love sex! I'm like a sex-addicted animal!" << Good! That's progress. At least that's true! You always want to start from a position of honesty and realness, not fakery.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't worry about your own survival, who else will? The ego's function is survival. This is very necessary if you want to stay alive.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Is the detachment from ego implies that you must feel dead inside?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not at all. This is a big misunderstanding of detachment and ego-death. Ego-death makes you feel alive inside.
</p>

<p>
	What you must realize is that detachment and egolessness cannot be faked. The only way to truly be selfless is to reach such a high state of consciousness that you are directly conscious that the ego isn't real. When an ego tries to pretend to be egoless but it doesn't have sufficient consciousness to realize it isn't real, that's disaster.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to really grow, you must start but admitting and giving up all your spiritual fakeness. The ego loves to adopt high spiritual ideas as if it can embody them. It can't. The ego has to realize its own unreality.
</p>

	All that is still under-selling psychedelics.

<title>I am struggling dealing with cancer</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/22809-no_thing__/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="22809" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/22809-no_thing__/" rel="">@No_thing__</a> Sorry to hear of your situation.
</p>

<p>
	I see a couple of issues here:
</p>

<p>
	1) I wouldn't worry about personal or spiritual development right now. You don't need that extra stress. Take it easy and focus all your efforts at healing. You can return to self-actualizing once you're healed. In a sense this is a wake-up call for you to start taking your health much more seriously and be proactive about it.
</p>

<p>
	2) The question of facing your death is a very serious one. The best way to achieve this quickly is through psychedelics like mushrooms or LSD. These are proven to help people cope with fear of death. What you can realize is that you are not this one life or this one body/mind/persona. So if you can get your hands on some mushrooms, they can help ease your fears about death. Death is not a bad thing. It is Infinity/Love/God. It is good to have some direct experience of this as you face life and death matters like this cancer. Spiritual understanding will give you peace.
</p>

<p>
	I've done so many psychedelics that I'm kinda looking forward to my death now. This human realm is so limited. Nothing of great importance will be lost. Greater things lie ahead.
</p>

<p>
	3) I would focus a lot of your energy on researching various possible health solutions for cancer. Don't just blindly follow the advice of Western doctors. You need to look into alternative methods, read, research, talk to people, find healers, etc. There is much about cancer and its treatment which conventional Western doctors do not understand and will never tell you about. But of course take the medicine you need. Never give up researching. You can find some amazing stuff.
</p>

Guys standards are a lot lower. If the girl is cute, not stupid and kind then she is enough for them. Girls are a lot more selective due to evolution, i don't blame them. But yeah it is more competitive. Everyone has standards of course. But you can have Gordon Ramsay standards or a local restaurant owner standards (food analogy here hehe)

<p>
	I use it. Hard to say how effective it is given all the other stuff I use/try.
</p>

<p>
	Probably not as effective as DMSA + ALA
</p>

<p>
	For zeolite to be effective is needs to be in synthetic nano-particle form, no merely clay. The clay is not gonna pass the blood-brain barrier, but the nano-particles should.

	Basically ANY art can be turned into millions of dollars if you are serious enough about it. Makes little difference what the art is: singing, dancing, sculpture, films, cartoons, novels, video games, woodworking, painting, design, legos, 3D modeling, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Success comes from turning it into a business. No one is going to do it for you or hand you a bunch of money. You must build it.

<p>
	It all depends on how it is "forced".
</p>

<p>
	Obviously the "force" has to be subtle and soft, not a literal quota to hit simply for sake of diversity. And the diverse people have to be well-qualified.

<p>
	So did Biden. That's simply because people have become a lot more politically engaged since 2016. The outrages have polarized both sides and made politics exciting again. So more people show up to vote, both smart ones and dumb ones.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, majority of people don't vote at all. All you have to do to get to show up is to make politics exciting again.

For example, yours is a masculine, mind oriented awakening, so yours will be way different and will have different abilities/attributes based on the way your consciousness works already. In a sense, were all gifted, just in different dimensions of consciousness. For some people spirituality could be a very sexual, creative and tantric act, and that could be their focus throughout their lifetime, or one could be very grounded, earthly, and thats their focus. if we look at spirituality instead of attaining enlightenment and put the focus on awakening our multidimensional nature, this could be recognized more. Im sure you've noticed this within your very logical and conceptual oriented mind. Also I wouldn't put the better/worse labels on it.

<p>
	That's cute and all, but in the end what matters is consciousness. Nothing can substitute for raw consciousness.

	The obstacle is how to attract clients with money and how to offer up spirituality in a tangible way so that people are winning to pay for it.
</p>

<p>
	You need a solid marketing strategy. Don't just expect things to work out naturally. You need to demonstrate methods for attracting clients with money.

	I haven't seen any good evidence that glutathion will detox heavy metals.
</p>

<p>
	To detox heave metals you need to detox it from your organs and brain. Which means the molecule has to cross the blood-brain barrier. Which very few molecules will do.

	Not only is it safe, if you have a deficiency, it would be unsafe to take anything less than 10,000 IU.

	1,000 IU is nothing. It's not even worth taking so little.
