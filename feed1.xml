	No, you cannot put advanced technology back in the bottle. It must be regulated by complex organizations.

<p>
	It's gotten so dumbed down and mainstream that the thing which made Elderscrolls great: Mirrowind, will never be repeated again. It's all downhill from here. Although I am looking forward to the next Elderscrolls. But I'm pretty sure they will dumb it down even more than Skyrim. Bethesda has sold its soul to the devil long ago. They don't understand what made Morrowind so special.

<p>
	The trope of women falling in love with their abusers is nothing new. Happens all the time. It's not offensive to say so. And the relationship between gamer fanboys and game publishers is almost the same dynamic on a psychological level. Fanboys love games, and game publishes know this and abuse them for it because they know the gamer is too addicted to leave.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing personal in what I said.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Your intuition is correct.
</p>

<p>
	Existence has no opposite. Existence includes both something and nothing. Nothing is not non-existence. Nothing is existence.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness exists, as Nothing. Your entire life experience has been an experience of Nothing. Life is what Nothing looks like and feels like. The key mistake you've made is that you've assumed that life is not nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Life = Nothing. The end.
</p>

<p>
	What humans call "non-existence" is actually pure existence as emptiness. A non-existent object is simply the existence of emptiness. It exists! As emptiness. But you have confused this for non-existence.
</p>

<p>
	When your dog dies, it continues to exist. As emptiness. All that happens in death is the loss of form and a return to existence as emptiness. Nothing is ever really lost.

<p>
	Meh... Witcher 3 is way overrated.
</p>

<p>
	CDPR was way overrated, and now reality hits. They bit off more than they could chew with this game.
</p>

<p>
	Gamers are so gullible and easy to exploit. Just give a game a Bladerunner theme and Keanu Reeves, and you sell 8 million units overnight regardless of substance.
</p>

<p>
	And like an abused girl, gamers will eagerly come back for more abuse in 8 years. And so will the absued developers. They too will come back for more crunch. And so the industry churns on.

<p>
	If they reach that point, they've already screwed up badly. We don't just ban people willy-nilly here. To get banned usually requires many offenses or a single very serious offense.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry, but my time is limited and I'm not going to bend over backwards for people who get banned.
</p>

<p>
	In all my years banning people, I have never seen a single banned person who was willing to correct their behavior. Not one. Even if they are willing, they are simply constitutionally incapable of it and I am not going to wait around for them to grow up.

<title>Mod Abuse of Power,what should you do if you sense that a mod is biased against you?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/58668-mod-abuse-of-powerwhat-should-you-do-if-you-sense-that-a-mod-is-biased-against-you/?do=findComment&amp;comment=794644</link>

<p>
	I keep a close eye on Mods to make sure they are well-behaved. And for the most part we have an excellent Mod team here that requires little guidance from me.
</p>

<p>
	If a Mod repeatedly makes mistakes and shows poor judgment they will lose Mod status (which has happened once or twice in the past). I'm generally very careful about selecting Mods to begin with, so it really don't get much better than this. Don't forget, Mods are human. They will never be perfect. I'm not perfect either. Policing this forum is a lot of work and policing will always involve an element of subjectivity.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a problem with Mod behavior you can always contact me about it. But if you do, you better present a solid case with solid evidence of abuse. Just because a Mod issued you a warning you disagree with does not mean the Mod is abusing their power.
</p>

<p>
	This forum would be a hell-hole without all the work our Mods do (for free).
</p>

<title>Does an invitation to trip together imply sex?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/58759-does-an-invitation-to-trip-together-imply-sex/?do=findComment&amp;comment=794631</link>

<p>
	Order of operations in dating is crucial. If you trip with a girl for your first date, the order will be wrong and you will go too deep too fast and it will feel weird and creepy -- which is the last thing girls want.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to sleep with her, you need to dial back the depth and seriousness. Tripping is serious business. You should not be doing that on a first date. Your first dates must be light, playful, fun, and as low-investment as possible. A coffee.
</p>

<p>
	By setting up a trip date, you're actually being needy as fuck. Why are you sharing such depth with some girl you haven't even slept with??? It makes no sense. Because you're needy, that's why. And she will smell it off you and it will creep her out. Save the tripping for after you slept with her 5 or 10 times.
</p>

<p>
	Order. Of. Operations.
</p>

<p>
	Escalation. Ladder.
</p>

<p>
	Learn it and follow it.
</p>

<p>
	DO NOT FALL IN LOVE BEFORE YOU SLEPT WITH HER! It's creepy as fuck.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest way to turn a girl off is by being creepy and needy. And you're combining the two of them into the ultimate Incel combo.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If a girl not willing to agree to a coffee with you, she will never agree to do anything else with you. There is no lower investment ask than a coffee. If she won't agree to that, she just don't find you attractive and nothing you do will change that.
</p>

<p>
	Of course.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of dumb ideas within left-wing anarcho-communism that will never fly.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot have socialism with a tiny government because any tiny government will just be overpowered by a large corporation. And you cannot reduce the size of corporations if you want to maintain the complexity of modern technology, industry, and logistics chains.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that small government is just a pipe dream. Government will only get bigger, not smaller.
</p>

<p>
	Leftists who think you can have socialism + a small government don't understand how government or management works. The government must be the biggest organization in the world, otherwise you won't have peace.
</p>

	Trump admin advisors have publicly said months ago that their strategy is herd immunity. Nothing new here.
</p>

<p>
	They must take this approach because they are too incompetent at governance to actually manage the crisis. So they just take a libertarian free-market attitude. It's an every-man-for-himself approach -- which is their entire philosophy.

<p>
	I never said I got laid from that one. She had a boyfriend.
</p>

<p>
	You can def approach girls with headphones. Stop giving a shit. Stop making excuses. If you find her attractive you must approach even if she's with her mother. Stop thinking about how to approach and just approach automatically. Move your feet towards her. Your mind will struggle to keep up with your feet, and that's okay.

</p>

<p>
	You can find comparision videos of it on YT.
</p>

<p>
	They overdelivered on visuals. Unfortunatwlely the rest of the game seems to suck. They tried to make the cool visuals and theme carry the whole game, and of course that will not fly.

<p>
	Just like Bladerunner, the visuals are cool but the movie itself sucks. All surface, no depths.

<title>Can psychedelics be used to heal DPDR? Should those with DPDR avoid psychedelics?</title>

<p>
	It's a crap shoot. Psychedelics could make you even more ungrounded and depersonalized.
</p>

<p>
	There's no simple formula here. It could make things worse or it could make things better, depending on how you trip and how you make sense of your trips.
</p>

<p>
	I would not count on psychedelics being some magic cure.

<p>
	I used to give him that same benefit of the doubt. But his latest videos are pushing the apocalypse angle hard, just without using that word. It's quite irresponsible and bad.
</p>

<p>
	I don't even understand what the point of his teachings and ashram is if an apocalypse is truly coming. If there is a nuclear war the last thing people will care about is enlightenment or yoga. All of that requires a peaceful stable society.

<p>
	"Being yourself" is not about adopting some material identity. It's about discovering your authentic personality by removing all your fears and bad social conditioning.
</p>

<p>
	You are God, but your mind/body has a unique personality that requires discovery and alignment.
</p>

<p>
	Being a millionaire is not a personality trait. It's just a material condition.
</p>

<p>
	"Being yourself" is good advice. But you need to understand what it means. It's overly simplistic. There's a lot to it.

	He's def not a sociopath/psychopath or ill-intentioned.
</p>

<p>
	I have said before that his apocalyptic videos are not good. And he seems to be ramping them up lately. Trump and Covid have made his apocalyptic message seem more credible, but I say it's an illusion. Ain't no apocalypse coming. And if it is, you're fucked anyway so there's no point preparing for it.
</p>

<p>
	The people who follow him at the ashram are definitely sheep. I can confirm that much. And most/all of them ain't enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	But overall his nondual teachings are solid. Just don't listen to the Kali yuga stuff.

	Vaccines are not standard meds. And you cannot sue Big Pharma for normal side-effects to their drugs. You can only sue them for willful malfeasance. If you take some drug and it causes your eyes to bleed, but that's considered a known side-effect, you can't sue for that.

<p>
	Because vaccines are necessary for society to function and pharmaceutical companies are not going to continue doing things which are not profitable for them without incentives.
</p>

<p>
	Every drug has some % of side-effects. The difference is, no drug other than a vaccine is mandated for 100s of millions of people by the government. When you have a sample size of 100 million+, there will be some bad cases.

<title>Why doesn't the government tell us how to be healthy?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	For the government to tell you how to be healthy it must first understand holistic health, which it does not because our culture has not yet evolved to such a level. Government's approach to health is mostly stage Blue/Orange. Which means materialistic health strategies that avoid preventative and holistic health.
</p>

<p>
	Also, the government's biggest job is to keep people from dying, not to make them thrive. The government is there to go very basic stuff, not to lead you towards greatness. That's your own responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	From the government's POV it is not a viable solution to just hand out free supplements to people because Covid will still ravage half the population who are unhealthy, obese, and who will not stick to a consistent vitamin schedule even if their lives depended on it.
</p>

<p>
	Since most people are dumb, government's solutions must be such as to work for and scale for tens of millions of dumb and lazy people. They must also scale for poor people, since 1/3rd of the US is poor and cannot even afford stuff like vitamins or healthy foods.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously it's selfish. But more importantly it's unstrategic because your chances of getting harmed by Covid are higher than getting harmed by its vaccine. By refusing the vaccine your risks actually increase.
</p>

<p>
	So as usual, selfishness and fear tends to backfire.

<p>
	This is her mistake. Because no matter how much she holds this position, her body and mind still must survive in the relative world.
</p>

<p>
	Voting is pointless if you don't care about dying and suffering. But of course you care extremely much about dying and suffering. Even if you are enlightened you STILL care about minimizing the suffering of others.

<p>
	This is a common trap, to conflate relative matters with absolute matters.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you understand nonduality does not mean that your mind will properly reason about society or politics.
</p>

<p>
	Telling spiritual people not to vote is extremely irresponsible and ignorant, no matter how enlightened you are. Enlightenment does not automatically grant sound political reasoning.

<p>
	All survival happens in the relative domain.
</p>

<p>
	If you give up the relative domain, you must also give up survival. You can do that, but do you really understand the severity of what you're doing?
</p>

<p>
	When your child is being raped, are you gonna be okay with that? << Those are the real stakes here. That's what politics boils down to. It's very serious stuff. Contrary to what most people think, politics is about as serious a topic as there could be. It's all about life and death and suffering. Which is why people get so ideological about it. If it wasn't important people would not become political radicals.

	And the choice to do nothing, politically-speaking, is still a choice. So you cannot escape politics. Politics will happen regardless, even if you decided to ignore it.

<p>
	Basically she's being an ostrich sticking her head in the sand, hoping that someone else will solve all the political problems while she basks in the Absolute. Which is actually a selfish position.

<p>
	That's absurd. Faster CPUs require a new chassis with faster bus, better cooling, and other such factors. Not to mention that many devices are mobile and don't have space for modules.
</p>

<p>
	The old units don't need to be tossed in the trash, they can be recycled. And usually before that happens they are resold many times over. No one just throws a CPU in the trash. They resell it.

<p>
	The market is actually quite good as being efficient when it comes to stuff like this. Central planning such things would be less efficient and more wasteful.

It's not simply greed. The people who work at these companies actually care about stuff -- they are not robots or zombies. The days of those kinds of corporations that only cared about profits are coming to an end. Because it's not culturally sustainable. If you want to retain the most talented employees, they will have ethical concerns about things. It comes with the package.

<p>
	Denying the results of a certified US Presidential Election is kinda a big deal if you care about maintaining democracy. These are not just some right-wing political videos. These are videos denying a Presidential Election that was not even close.

<p>
	The whole point of policing is that it's not enough to call a thief a thief, you have to ban him too. There must be consequences when people try to spread lies for profit and power.
</p>

<p>
	It's like, people understand the function of policing in the material world, but in the online work they think that policing doesn't need to happen and things will just magically go well. No. If you don't police online spaces criminals will take them over. Bad actors are always looking for entry points.

</p>

<p>
	It is ironic that those who cry about 1984 are in fact using 1984 to denounce YT for calling a lie and lie. Hence those who call YT "censorship" are in fact using the Newspeak and Doublethink of 1984.
</p>

<p>
	"Freedom of speech" is in fact Doublethink, invented by the devil so that that devil is free to keep spreading his lies. And any time someone calls out the devil's lies, he pulls out the Free Speech card. Classic gaslighting.

<p>
	You will never have total freedom to spread bullshit and lies without consequence in a healthy society.
</p>

<p>
	Censorship is when truthful things are banned by powerful people because it threatens their power. What YT did is not censorship, it's the policing of devilry. It's the same thing as contemporary Germany banning Nazi symbols and propaganda.
</p>

<p>
	A platform the size of YT will always have moderation and rules against misinformation.
</p>

<p>
	If the left wing starts to spread misinformation to the same degree and with the same reckless shamelessness as the right wing, then they too should be banned.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is the false equivalence drawn by right-wingers between right and left. They are not two equal but opposite sides. The right-wing lies much more and so they rightly get slapped more for it.
</p>

<p>
	If the right-wing cared about truthfulness even a bit, most of these "censorship" problems would disappear. But of course a liar does not like when his lies get called out or fact-checked.

			<strong>2)</strong> How can imaginary also be so tangible?
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Example:</strong> The ferocious dog is imaginary, and then I touch the imaginary dog, and it bites me. I have a deep wound on my leg. My leg is also imaginary. I feel the pain, though. There are tears - imaginary, as well.
		</p>

		<p>

		<p>
			I am not going to sit there laughing, right? - "Look, hahaha, an imaginary dog bit me and there's this random liquid oozing out of my body, but this liquid, color and the body is imaginary, and this sensation, which feels so real is also imaginary - fantastic."

		<p>
			I appreciate your insights.

<p>
	Since imagination is infinite, nothing can exist outside it, and there is nothing else you can contrast it with, so it becomes reality. Imagination is Absolute. "It's so tangible" is just one aspect of imagination. It can be tangible or intangible or an infinite number of other things.
</p>

<p>
	There's no problem per se with a 25 year old girl dating a 40 year old, because she's mature enough to be responsible for herself. So it's not the age difference that's the main problem here. The problem is that a girl who's 18-22 is immature as hell and doesn't know what she's doing.

			I get what you are saying - and I have one more question:
		</p>

		<p>
			What about human expression through the means of procreation? Where would we fit that? Isn't procreation somewhere linked to the human desire for symbolic immortality, based on a myriad of emotions? 
		</p>

		<p>
			How would an enlightened person look at this? Why do most traversing the path towards enlightenment abstain from this - monks, etc.?

<p>
	Most enlightened people I've met have kids.

<p>
	In practice, enlightened people fuck just like everyone else.

<p>
	So what?
</p>

<p>
	You have to distinguish between the reasons for how that comes about. Girls have lots of one night stands simply from being highly social and because they get pumped and dumped by guys.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are misunderstanding enlightenment. It doesn't eliminate emotions, it allows you to feel them stronger and deeper, and appreciate them more.
</p>

<p>
	Unenlightened people express themselves in neurotic and dysfunctional ways because they are run unconsciously by based emotions related to fear.
</p>

<p>
	Conscious people express themselves more authentically, functionally, and creatively in alignment with Truth & Love.
</p>

<p>
	Creative expression is going to happen regardless because that's not a human quality, that's God's very nature. God is infinite creative expression. The closer you get to God, the more creative and powerful your expression will be.
</p>

<p>
	You should distinguish low consciousness emotions centered around fear and falsehood vs high consciousness emotions centered around Love & Truth.

<p>
	I'm not talking about incels or virgins or even number of sexual partners.
</p>

<p>
	It may very well be that women have more sexual partners on average than men.
</p>

<p>
	But women still don't employ a pump and dump strategy while men do.
</p>

<p>
	In general, since women socialize more they have sex more. If a guy socialized as much as the average girl, he'd get laid a lot more.

<p>
	Not as much as men.

<p>
	Most women are not looking for casual encounters.

	Occasionally girls are out to have fun and purely get a one night stand, but this is an exception not the norm. Girl cannot afford to be perceived as a slut. It hurts her survival value too much.

	The reason men are content with less is because they will pump and dumb. When you pump and dump you could sleep with a hippo and be okay.
</p>

<p>
	Men are actually NOT content with less, they're just always angling for more.
</p>

<p>
	Since women don't employ the pump and dumb strategy nearly as much, of course they will be choosier.

<p>
	The problem is the extreme power imbalance which will lead to him abusing/exploiting her unless he is a saint. Which of course he is not because he's already playing devilish games with hiding his age. Only a devil would want to date a 19 year old to begin with. So obviously he's gonna exploit her and she's too young and dumb to understand that.
</p>

<p>
	Which is exactly why her parents would (correctly) freak out if they found out. You might as well tell them that their daughter is hanging out at the Playboy Mansion.
</p>

<p>
	Men will go to great lengths to scheme to get young girls.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing good will come of this. You might want to tell her parents because this dude could seriously traumatize her for a long time. Best case scenario he will just exploit her for sex and break her heart. Worse case scenario he will manipulate her so bad that she'll be in therapy for the rest of her life.
</p>

<p>
	There is no happy fairy-tale ending here. He will exploit her. You better act fast before she falls in love with him.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of dating a 19 year old is that he gets to exploit her. Like a cat playing with a mouse. It's obvious to anyone with some sense what this guy is doing.
</p>

<p>
	I am not interested in collaborations. I have my own work. Wilber has his own work. There is no need for us to collaborate.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like doing things which have no purpose of being done. I have enough work cut out for me for the next 20 years. Everything else for me is a distraction from that. My work is not going to get much better all the sudden from collaborating with someone. It will actually get worse. My work is not of the type that is done by a group of people. I'm not in the business of engineering rocket ships here. I am an intellectual and intellectuals do their best work solo. If I wanted to work in a group I would be making video games.

Then again, a college degree might be helpful here so why not get it if it's gonna help your work?
</p>

<p>
	The concern should not be about college, but about whatever is necessary to get good at your job. If that means college, then college it is. If that means some other way, then that's the way.
</p>

<p>
	There are so many different possible positions within the field of counseling people that you've got tons of different options.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you can become a hypnotherapist. This requires no college degree. A master in hypnosis can help many people.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking inside the box. There are at least 100 different ways you could carve out a niche for yourself in this field.
</p>

<p>
	And don't be afraid of college. You can find great psychology programs if you bother to look.

<p>
	You totally misinterperated what he said.
</p>

<p>
	He said, "The <u><strong>utility</strong></u> of your career (relative to family), maybe that peaks by the time you're 35 or 40 and then it starts to decline pretty rapidly".
</p>

<p>
	He was not talking about your career declining at all. He was talking about the relative <strong><u>utility</u></strong> (significance) of family, love, and children.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of older people have great careers that are peaking. That's not the issue. The issue is, will that career truly satisfy you?
</p>

<p>
	He was basically making the point that being a workaholic is not a good strategy for happiness. Which of course is true.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, having a bunch of kids is also not a good strategy for happiness. Most miserable people in the world probably have kids. JP has kids. Is he happy? Nope.
</p>

<p>
	Happiness is not a function of material conditions. And kids are a material condition.

	BTW, even though I said above that I have a policy of not engaging with reactionaries, I will still always be open to constructive feedback. I rarely get good constructive feedback, usually it's trolling type stuff which I ignore. But if I see genuine constructive feedback I will read it and take it into consideration since I do make mistakes and my ways of teaching can be improved.

	I have no interest in tearing him down. I am happy if he is doing his creative work and helping to popularize and educate about psychedelics. There is value in that and I want to morally support my fellow psychonaut pioneers. We psychonauts should not be fighting each other. We just need to recognize that we will have differences of perspective about psychedelics in the same way that spiritual teachers have differences in perspective about God.

<p>
	The thing is this: if Adeptus and I had a public talk to hash all this out, in the end all that would happen is that we would be talking past each other because we have relativistically different POV. These relativistic differences would not be resolved, and even if they were -- in the best case scenario -- all that would be revealed is a series of mutual misunderstandings. Nothing of substance would be revealed or learned.
</p>

<p>
	This is the nature of all debates and public feuds. They are debates about nothing. Just differences in perspective based upon difference in consciousness, experience, and various biases.
</p>

<p>
	So this kind of "spinning of wheels" is the kind of thing I wish to avoid with my creative energies. I see it all over YouTube and I have never seen anything that I value come out of it.

<p>
	Generally though, you will NEVER discover the truth via a conversation with someone else. All conversation is a distraction from spiritual practice. Which is why your ego craves it so much.

			Leo, you stated you would be interested in a public discussion and I (perhaps incorrectly, but I'm sure I am not alone here) interpreted that as you offering to have an on camera conversation - after all, our primary method of public broadcast is YouTube and that is where our collective audience is. That you expect me to engage with this forum rather than our common platform, and that you have ignored all my previous communications since your initial offer, makes the offer itself appear insincere and more like an attempt at damage control.

You are absolutely NOT responsible for Connor, but you are responsible for YOUR treatment of Connor - clearly you agree at least to some level, because you have stopped calling him an unhinged lunatic and started treating him like a human being. So NO, you are not expected to "support" Connor Murphy, but you are expected to not be a total arse to him just because he is parroting you. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The reason I reached out to him is: 1) Because I don't want him to hurt himself, and 2) Because I don't want him to give spirituality and psychedelics and Actualized.org a bad image. Yes, your video spurred me into taking these possibilities more seriously because in general I don't take people like Connor seriously unless I'm really forced to. I don't sit around watching people's spiritual videos. My attention is focused on my own work. When some posts a video mentioning me or criticizing me, I have zero interest in seeing it. My initial reaction is that it's a distraction. Any errors in my work will not be revealed to me by some YouTube reactionary, they will be found by myself. I don't need you to tell me where I'm deluded, I will find all those areas much deeper myself.
</p>

<p>
	I still hold to my initial statements:
</p>

<p>
	1) Connor is acting like an unhinged lunatic in the way he style his videos. Any casual observer with perceive him to be unhinged, regardless of whether this is true or not. I wanted to speak to Connor to find out if he's actually unhinged in person. My conversation with him was healthy and reasonable. I wish he came off that way in his videos so people don't get the wrong idea. But he told me he deliberately plays up the crazy for purpose of views and clicks. To me that's a waste of my time. This entire "controversy" is basically nothing but clickbait drama. Which is why I don't usually respond to such things. It's a distraction from serious spiritual work. I generally don't like it when people create controversy and drama just for attention because this seriously distracts my audience from the deep work they should be focused on doing. I am protective of my audience's attention. I don't want it directed towards dramatic stuff like Connor's Tantric sex. It's a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
	2) I still hold that Connor is a Zen devil. I have an old video: Becoming A Zen Devil, where I explain many of the traps Connor is falling into.
</p>

<p>
	My treatment of Connor was fine considering that I try to keep my focus on my own work and not the work of others. When a guy comes off as unhinged I don't give that person much of my attention. That's what happened. Then your video made me rethink the situation and get involved. I generally don't like getting involved in such things because it's usually not constructive or productive.

			2. The disconnect of YOU calling Connor an "unhinged lunatic", for saying almost word for word the EXACT same things you say is utterly absurd.

<p>
	No, he is not saying the same things I am saying. Not at all. I have never engaged in clickbait with my channel. I do the opposite of clickbait and it costs me millions of views and $$$. So to compare my teachings with Connor is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	Just because Connor says basic spiritual truths such as "I am God" or "Life is a dream" or "Do psychedelics" does not mean his teachings are the same as mine. Those a common spiritual truths which many spiritual teachers say. What matters is the other 95% of the teaching.

			3. I fully appreciate that going through a process on camera is messy, and when framed as a subjective stream of thought then I have zero complaint with that. My issue is that doing so WITHOUT that proper framing is irresponsible, and both you and Connor are making the same mistakes here. Sure we all say strange things as we go through our process, but your "I'm leaving video" makes many statements framed as objective fact - and not to state the obvious, but you made this video BEFORE your 30 days of 5MEO. So NO you weren't recovering from 30 days of 5MEO breakthrough... unless of course we are adding time travel to your list of abilities?

<p>
	My leaving video was recorded after a massive breakthrough in consciousness facilitated by 5-MeO-DMT, which is why I left to do the 30 day retreat. I was also going through a very challenging health situation.

			4. I have never made a video on your "5MEO in the bath" antics. All my criticisms and footage I have ever shown are specific to the "I'm leaving" video which I have stated many times, and I try not to get bogged down in the numerous "Look what Leo has done now!" requests I receive. I think the fact that you are bundling it into this situation and getting defensive about it, probably says more about how YOU feel about that "5MEO in the bath" video.

<p>
	Firstly, there were no "antics". I just sat in a bath. That's it. That's what you call "antics".
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, I thought you had an issue with my taking a bath on 5-MeO-DMT. I know some YouTube reactionary did, I guess that wasn't you but someone else. I confuse you with that someone else. My bad and my apologies.

			If you want my opinion on it - then I think setting up a laptop in the bathroom for the explicit purpose of watching porn and masturbating in the bathtub while high, is simply an indication that you have an unresolved porn addiction rather than an expression of supreme spirituality. But hey - whatever rocks your boat dude.

<p>
	Addiction is your assumption. I never said anything about addiction. It was a spiritual experience, and an amazing one that you only wish you had. To become fully conscious of what sexual desire is, is a profound awakening. And to give yourself the sexual pleasure you desire is also a profoundly healing spiritual experience.

			5. Yes I am white knighting Connor, because sometimes people need a white knight. One can only assume that on some level you agree, because you did a 180, stopped making derogatory comments about Connor, reached out to him, and now everyone seems happier for it. This is the beauty of peeking outside of the echo chamber once in while, because sometimes the position you have needs to be challenged. Now that job is done I can ride my white horse home.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Calling Connor a Zen devil was a precise articulation of his problem. My comments were derogatory in the same way that anyone new watching some of Connor's unhinged videos would react. BTW, I withheld commenting or judging Connor for many months. People have been posting his videos here since last spring and I withheld judgment even though in the back of my mind I already saw that this guy was a troublemaker and a potential distraction. I only called him an unhinged lunatic after enough of his videos were posted here and your video linking him to me was the straw that broke the camel's back.
</p>

<p>
	I toned down my language so that I could reach out to Connor and find some common ground to try to persuade him not to go down the road of Zen devilry. If he continues making unhinged clickbait videos, my initial opinions of him will stand. I want to give him some space to correct himself.

			6. I have never questioned whether you are, or are not God, nor stated that you claim God is exclusive to you. This is a strawman of my criticism, so allow me to clarify. My criticism simply revolves around the abilities you claim can be unlocked by having had the God awakening - an awakening which according to YOU, you have gone through multiple times. My argument is simply that such abilities are completely delusional bullshit, along with the various ego inflations which seem to accompany it.
		</p>

<p>
	Such abilities are not delusional bullshit. But these abilities require serious spiritual practice to actualize. A psychedelic trip alone will not grant these abilities in the sober state. This is still something I'm researching and figuring out.

			I don't want to go through the entire video blow by blow, but here is one of your direct quotes to accurately highlight my position, and how your statements are being framed as objective fact rather than fluffy poetic subjective interpretations (see point 3 above)
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong><em>"I can help you to discover that you are God. When you do realize that you are God, this will instantaneously solve every single problem in your life, not only that but it will heal you, it will heal you of every disease and problem that you have"</em></strong>
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That particular statement was overstated, to be fair to you. And I can see why that would arouse skepticism in people like you.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless, deep consciousness can indeed resolve and heal many problems in your life. It's not a magic cure for everything. Some problems need to be fixed at the material level. So I will concede that point to you. I exaggerated with that statement. I do have tendency to exaggerate and overstate things sometimes in order to communicate the depth and profundity of these remarkable states of super-human consciousness. Sober words don't really do these states justice.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is that everything that I said about spirituality, consciousness, and psychedelics is a gross understatement. I have accessed states of consciousness which are absolutely beyond anything that could be explained or taught, or that has been accessed by traditional teachers. Doubt me if you like, but I don't care. In these states of consciousness literally every problem is resolved. The problem is how to sustain such consciousness. That's the only real problem.

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">

			Now as for all the various claims about psychic powers, nonduality, what all this means - that's something we could get into if you ever want to ACTUALLY ENGAGE with me, but I'm not going to spend any more time on this forum than need be. I signed up purely for the reason to take you up on your offer for a public conversation, but if that offer is no longer there or that I misconstrued it then this account is of no use to me. Forum based back and forths are often petty and unproductive, and I think you of all people know this, so why you would suggest it as an appropriate medium for a discussion like this is baffling - again it just reeks of the insincerity of the original offer.
		</p>

		<p>
			My offer for a conversation is still there, and as I think this whole debacle has perfectly highlighted - sometimes its good to be challenged. That challenge works both ways, and make no mistake about it Leo - you could certainly challenge me, and I think we could have a fascinating conversation. Despite how you might read my admittedly snarky and blunt comments, I have said many times that I greatly respect what you have achieved here with Actualized, and that you have done some superb work with great insights. I sincerely tip my hat towards you and encourage you to stick your head above the trench-line, because the greater conversation around psychedelics and consciousness will happen anyway - just without you. This is somewhat tragic because I think you have valuable contributions to make to the discourse that is happening OUTSIDE of Actualized, if you could just pull your head out of your own arse and be prepared to accept a few bruises to your ego.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I get very little out of engaging with you. It takes up time which I could invest in creating better videos.
</p>

<p>
	I have a general policy not to engage with any reactionary material to my work. Now, of course, my critics will chalk that up to the fact that my positions are too weak to be defended in public debate. But the reality is that the things I teach cannot be debated at all. So I don't debate and I don't react. I don't really do interviews either. Because I want all my attention to be focused on constructive work.
</p>

<p>
	My policy has always been not to engage reactionaries. I made a rare exception for your video because Connor has a large audience and I don't want them to get misled about this work, and also because I became somewhat concerned about Connor's psychological health. Your video did make me take this issue more seriously, as I initially dismissed the seriousness of the situation. Because my mind is not focused on anyone's work but my own. So some thanks to you for that. If a see some crazy YouTuber doing something, I generally have no interest in butting in. I got my own work to focus on.
</p>

<p>
	This whole incident, thanks your video, has made me even more convinced that in the future I will not be responding to any reactionary YouTube content about me. And that is because nothing of value comes from it. I will not do debates and I will not defend any of my teachings. My teachings will stand completely on their own merits. My teachings are true only if you can validate them for yourself. Anything that comes out of my mouth which you cannot validate is not true. Which makes things very simple. My teachings are not an ideology of any kind and therefore they require no defending or debate. You cannot discover the truth of my teachings via a conversation, discussion, or debate. You cannot know whether miraculous healing is possible from super-human states of consciousness via discussion on YouTube. The only way to solve that is to actually do it.
</p>

<p>
	I thank you for your willingness to engage in a public conversation, but I would rather focus my time and energy towards creating positive new content rather than distracting my audience with drama, gossip, and controversy.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that I'm saying you're wrong, either. Even if you are right, I will let the audience make that determination for themselves while I move on with doing my constructive work. But I simply have no interest in publicly adjudicating rightness or wrongness. A much faster way to adjudicate that is through actual practice. Practice is what will cut out all the falsehood. If you are right and I am wrong, practice will show that. So I would rather just direct my audience to practice more.

			One final point I would like to address is more to your fans who seem entirely obsessed with the notion that "I am here to cash in by milking the Leo cow". I find comments like this about views and subs to be extremely lame, but since I am already here and we are having a reality check then lets roll with this.
		</p>

		<p>
			Out of 102 videos I have made then 3 are about Leo (its really more like 2.5 since this last one is more about Connor Murphy, but lets round it up to 3). None of those 3 are anywhere close to my best performing videos - so NO, Leo is not a cash cow. My best performing videos are all related to substances (DMT, 5MEO, Amanita), so if we must use such crude analogies then SUBSTANCES are the cash cow by ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Okay, good for you. In general I have a very low opinion of YouTubers who make their careers as reactionaries. If that's not you, then great. I wish you a long and happy career as a constructive content creator rather than a troll.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe at some point in the future we could have a public conservation, but right now my focus is on deepening my own practice. I'm not even much interested lately in being a YouTuber. Very soon most of my focus will be going into my own radical awakening and spiritual practice. When I do my deepest work you will not even know that I exist.

<p>
	Only use 3 labels: see, hear, feel.
</p>

<p>
	Everything will fall under those labels.
</p>

<p>
	Smell and taste will just fall under feel.
</p>

<p>
	Do not invent anything new. This is not an exercise in creativity or thinking. The point is that it forces your mind to focus and be mindful.

<p>
	This is a self-improvement forum.
</p>

<p>
	The idea is to, like, improve yourself, rather than making up excuses for why you can't.
</p>

<p>
	Change yourself so girls want you. This idea never even occured to your brilliant scientists.
</p>

<p>
	Self-improvement is a non-zero sum game. It makes no difference what the others guys are doing. Just improve yourself.
</p>

<p>
	There are millions of single women just waiting for a great guy to come along. A great guy is not born, he is self-made.
</p>

	If you live in the UK then the best place for pickup is obviously London.
</p>

<p>
	Look, all the best cities will be pricier than living in a village.
</p>

<p>
	There are tons of great big cities in Europe for game. It's more a function of where you are allowed to go, where you wanna live, and what nationality of girl you like.
</p>

<p>
	London is probably one of the best places in the world for game.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Easy. Shadow is sorta just the inverse of ego. Anything you think that isn't you and should not exist.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you think rapists should not exist, that's your shadow. You fail to accept that you are all the rapists in the world. This denial of rape is ego. It comes from fear, not Love.
</p>

<p>
	If you were infinitely conscious you would realize and accept that you are a rapist, thereby healing the division between you and the rapey part of reality. The rapey part of reality is your shadow. It's that part of yourself which you have disowned in order to maintain an ego.
</p>

<p>
	If he got it on the black market, it could easily be diluted with fentanyl.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like to get a legal prescription requires that one be an opioid addict, which, if this guy was, is the source of the problem.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt you can just go to a doctor and say, "Hey, I'm having trouble sleeping, could you give me some methodone?"
</p>

<p>
	The only folks I know who get legal methodone are hardcore heroin addicts in rehab clinics. But I could be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	If this dude was an addict, all bets are off. He could have all sorts of drugs in his system. We really need to know his history of drug use.

<p>
	DMT has a very distinct appearance, texture, smell, and feel.
</p>

<p>
	Vape a tiny amount of it and smell it and feel it.
</p>

<p>
	Using a test kit you can easily identify if the powder is a psychedelic vs something else. If it is a psychedelic then it's hard to go wrong with a small dose.

<p>
	A shadow is any aspect of yourself/Universe which you demonize, judge, and hate because you think it is not your self.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you hate Nazis, you are not conscious that you are actually hating your own self.
</p>

<p>
	Well, JP has done that with stage Green. He is waging a war on himself without realizing it. And it kills him inside.

<p>
	Start with 10mg
</p>

<p>
	10mg of basically any tryptamine will not kill you and will rarely produce a super strong trip.
</p>

<p>
	10mg is a safe starting point for plugging almost anything.

<p>
	In the end you NEVER know. Which is why every chem has to be tested with tiny amounts to start.
</p>

<p>
	The nice thing with vaping is that you can take tiny puffs and slowly dial up. But still, a cocky noob could mess this up by taking a giant rip.

<p>
	Vaping itself will not be lethal unless something else is wrong, but vaping will surely amplify any errors.
</p>

<p>
	Stopping breathing from plugging is just realistically not gonna happen. It's not so rapid or intense. Vaping a large dose can cause breathing problems because a large vaped dose will hit you like a sledgehammer and multiply any complications by 5x.
</p>

<p>
	It ought to be something more than just vaping to kill you. Unless for some rare genetic anomoly.
</p>

<p>
	It would help to know if this guy had ever done 5-MeO or DMT before and how he handled it.

<p>
	If DMT and 5-MeO dosages were confused AND he had other stuff still in his system like methadone, that might be enough.
</p>

<p>
	Or it might be a problem with adulterants in the substance depending on how he sourced it.

<p>
	Very unfortunate to hear.
</p>

<p>
	But he was taking methadone?? Isn't that like heroin? How did he source it? If it was not from a good source it might have contained fentanyl which is very lethal.
</p>

<p>
	It does not make sense that a single hit of 5-MeO-DMT would kill a man. And what was the dose? Was it really 5-MeO or something else? More info needed before drawing conclusions.
</p>

<p>
	To stop breathing on 5-MeO would require a big dose and she should have been able to help him regain breathing if he stopped.
</p>

<p>
	An important precaution is to always start very low and gradually ramp up. And really, plug it instead of vaping.
</p>

	On the one hand it's admirable.
</p>

<p>
	On the other hand, to spend that much time developing a theory which is fundamentally false is a tragedy. And really that is his biggest problem: he is lost in his thinking mind. If I did what he did, I would go fucking insane. It would be very mentally unhealthy.

			You know, big part of the reason I started with pickup is to able to be myself around other people in general and to express myself fully. To not walk in this stiffled state all the time.

	It doesn't matter. Pickup will increase your social confidence permanently across the board. You will become better at talking to strangers, barbers, taxi drivers, clerks, shopkeepers, etc.

	RSD's original live Hotseat weekend seminars were definitely worth the $300.
</p>

<p>
	The live footage blows your mind open as far as what you imagine is possible in game.
</p>

<p>
	Although a lot of the game is deliberately flashy and not really as practical as less flashy methods. But still that flashy game can build up your confidence and balls.
</p>

<p>
	The original Hotseat helped me grow the balls to do some ballsy direct approaches which was important in my development.

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">

</div>

<p>
	JP does have some sophisticated and important ideas. His psychological insights are usually valid.
</p>

<p>
	It's mostly his anti-Green politics that are the problem.

It could be nice to have that degree in your pocket when applying for some jobs.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, if you definitely know that your LP and future career will not have anything to do with law, then it's probably a formality and a waste of time and money. 7 months is a lot of time that you could invest into your LP.
</p>

<p>
	A lack of degree is not going to keep you from success in your LP if you're truly serious and passionate about it. At worst it will be a minor annoyance.
</p>

<p>
	If you're super-limited by finances then maybe go for the degree if you will need it to get your first job and hold you over. But if your finances allow it, I would shoot directly for your LP.
</p>

<p>
	That sunk cost effect is a bitch.

	One thing I can tell you for sure, your heart will glow the moment you stop doing law and your passion and motivation will flourish. There's nothing that weight the heart down more than doing projects that you know hold zero meaning for you.

<p>
	Yes, you lack an awakening into the nature of what "other" is.
</p>

<p>
	You're just not conscious of that facet of awakening yet.

<p>

<p>
	Of course there's nothing outside of God's perspective.
</p>

<p>
	You need to become so fucking conscious that even the notion of multiple perspectives collapses. There are not multiple perspectives. There is only one perspective.
</p>

<p>
	You see the problem? You are constructing all of "reality" and yet you're trying to treat this as though there is some reality outside your constructions. But how would it come to exist unless you constructed it?
</p>

<p>
	Nothing can exist unless you fool yourself into believing it does. That's how stuff comes into existence! Stop taking existence for granted. Stuff doesn't just exist all by itself. It only exists in the mind of God (YOU).
</p>

<p>
	You're not gonna understand this without psychedelics.

<title>Psychotherapy for improving my social life?</title>

<p>
	Personally I haven't gotten any self-esteem boost from mindfulness meditation. It's just not designed for that.
</p>

<p>
	I think therapy can be positive if you have some childhood trauma which sources your low self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
	I'd say the #1 solution to this problem is going out regularly, socializing regularly, and taking to attractive girls regularly so that you feel them getting attracted to you. As you attract more of them you will start to feel better about yourself and develop some confident and shatter some limit beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	The #2 solution is psychedelics, which are far more powerful than any therapy at getting you to truly love yourself. Basically, psychedelics will do what therapy does but 100x deeper, faster, and cheaper. But they will be more emotionally taxing and challenging because you'll be accomplishing more work in less time.
</p>

<p>
	You won't understand what true self-love or self-acceptance is until you do some psychedelics. No therapist can explain you this because they themselves don't have it or know it.
</p>

<p>
	It simply won't work and I told him that. The women will just get addicted and attached to the feelings of love, and these will be feelings of conditional love, not Absolute Love with detachment. And then they will get their heart broken as those attachments necessarily shatter. He thinks these women will be able to maintain a sort of enlightened detachment -- but of course they won't. Not even close, because they would first need to do 10 years of consciousness work for that even be thinkable.
</p>

<p>
	It's not like this hasn't been tried in the past with disaterous consequences. But Connor believes he can do it better and avoid all the traps because he is here to awaken the world through materialistic means.

<p>
	Connor has a sort of blind optimism where he feels that he can do no wrong and everything will just work out as long as his intentions are good.
</p>

<p>
	I am not so optimistic about human nature.
</p>

<p>
	He believes that as long as one is "fully awake" then one can do no wrong, and if one does wrong then one is not "fully awake".
</p>

<p>
	Of course I have always taught the exact opposite of that. No matter how awake you are, self-deception and devilry is always luring right around the corner. No amount of awakening will save you from mistakes and wrong-doing. That requires extreme vigilance, which he doesn't care too much about. Hence evil will happen. But he disagrees.

<p>
	Spirituality is a long process. Best to pace yourself and focus on doing the daily practices diligently.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind will go through hundreds and even thousands of highs, lows, states, reactions, backlashes, opinions, stories, fantasies, etc. over the years of practice. Don't get too wrapped up in that. Keep your eye on the ball.

	Please note: while Connor can do as he likes on his own channels, this forum will not be used for outrageous clickbait, drama, and other such self-promotional games. I am not going to be giving publicity to people who engage in deliberate attention-whoring or who give spirituality or psychedelics an unhinged look for the sake of clicks.
</p>

<p>
	My general rule is to not engage with response videos or attention-seekers.

	Well, I had a good long conversation with Connor and we discussed plenty of traps involved in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Overall he's a lot more reasonable than he appears in his zany videos. His videos are overly dramatic for views and clicks. I'm not concerned for his mental health. He seems stable and happy and he has a pretty good grasp of nonduality. The only concern besides the image problems he creates for himself is some of the bold plans he has for teaching people awakening via Tantric sex, which I think is not gonna be effective and will be ripe for hurt/abuse. We've discussed the dangers and he's aware of my concerns but ultimately it's his business and it has nothing to do with what I teach. His and my styles and standards for teaching are very different. He likes a flamboyant and dramatic approach. I explained to him the dangers of that. He is open to feedback but also a firm believer in his approach and techniques.
</p>

<p>
	Connor's a decent guy from what I can tell and perhaps in 5 or 10 years he will make a solid teacher as his style matures. He's quite young and cocky so of course the maturity is still lacking, but that's to be expected for someone his age.
</p>

<p>
	We had little disagreement on the substance of nonduality or God. Our differences lie in style, attitude, and values. What he learned from me is not the style but some metaphysical and epistemic articulations which helped him make sense of his psychedelic awakening experiences.
</p>

<p>
	He was enjoyable to talk to. I wish him well.
</p>

	Salvia produces a degree of no-self that is so radical it is terrifying. You will not be able to remember your own name or how you were born.

<p>
	Stan Grof wrote entire books about "spiritual emergencies" and "spiritual crises".
</p>

<p>
	This is very, very common in the spiritual world. If you're going to practice hardcore spirituality you will almost certainly face a spiritual emergency at some point if you go deep enough. Many people don't go deep enough so they don't understand. And this is not exclusive to psychedelics. Hardcore meditation can be just as challenging.
</p>

<p>
	Smoke enough salvia and you'll have a spiritual emergency, I promise. Salvia will scare the living daylight out of you. It will wipe away your whole reality within seconds and you will cry for mommy like a little girl. And there will be no mercy with salvia. It will not treat you with kid gloves like some other psychedelics. Just as you're begging for mercy it will rip your face off.
</p>

	Any state of consciousness radically beyond one's own will be perceived as madness.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	The kind of insight I'm talking about is a total state of awakening and infinite consciousness that you become. It's nothing that can ever be mistaken and it cannot be validated or invalidated by any other human.
</p>

<p>
	When you become infinitely conscious -- that's it. You are more conscious than any of these gurus and teachers. You are equally conscious to God. You ARE God. The end. All gurus and teachings become a joke. Become so conscious that every guru looks like an idiot.
</p>

<p>
	You are God. Don't let any fool convince you otherwise. They have no clue what God means. God is not merely no-self. And God is not merely some void. These are all inferior and reductionistic nondual understandings. They are not as high or as deep as God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	Do not stop until you hit INFINITY.
</p>

<p>
	Not necessary.
</p>

<p>
	You can practice physical escalation at the club on random girls.
</p>

<p>
	Physical game is a huge part of learning game. Practice it for a few months at a busy nightclub and you'll get pretty good.
