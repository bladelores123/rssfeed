<p>
	That's a terrible idea to put into peoples minds. We want more people voting, not less.
</p>

<p>
	American elections are often very close, meaning that every vote is significant.
</p>

<p>
	Trump won due to about 70,000 votes in key states. Bush vs Gore was even closer.

<p>
	I have already endorsed Bernie so there's not much for me to say.
</p>

<p>
	My general advice on politics is: vote for the most conscious person who stands a chance of winning.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie has the most progressive platform and is the least corrupted by corporations and lobbyists. He also has the longest track record of being progressive. Many other progressives are only skin deep.
</p>

<p>
	Telling people who to vote for is sorta pointless because people will vote no higher than their own ego will allow.
</p>

			The reason why he said this was basically that society is worse now because men used do men stuff and women used do women stuff, and now that we all do the same things that's caused so many problems. And when the interviewer said to him something like, 'Certainly equality is good in the basic ways like voting, right?' And Elliot responded by saying something that dodged answering the question directly but implied that perhaps we should 'be open minded' and consider rescinding those rights from women.

<p>
	You cannot just blindly mix DPT with that stuff, it could be very dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	You have to take it clean, without any other meds or supplements or things. Otherwise you'll never understand what is causing what.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be foolish folks. Mixing research chemicals with random things is irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
	Do not mix psychedelics with nootropics unless you specifically tested to make sure it's okay.
</p>

<p>
	Test! Test! Test! Every little detail.

	For some people the plugging method itself seems not to work. Maybe because they have different bacteria or genetics or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	You need to test that plugging is a method that actually works on you, regardless of substance.

<p>
	God has infinite power. The more Godlike your lucidity is, the more of it you will access until you will melt into the universe. Finally, your will will be indistinguishable from physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	Right now your questions are coming from a place of personal egoic control. That will melt away long before you access even a small fraction of God's power.
</p>

<p>
	The desire to manipulate reality is itself an obstacle here. Once you reach God-like levels of consciousness you will see that you do not need to manipulate the things you thought needed manipulating. The desire to manipulate usually comes from a lack of consciousness of the perfection of reality and lack of self-acceptance. Once your self-acceptance hits infinity, little needs manipulating.

	Mu is just a pointer for Absolute Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	In essence the koan is telling you: forget about your human self, forget about the dog, and realize that you are the whole fucking universe imagining the human and the dog.

<p>
	That is Mu.

	I wouldn't put it like that.

<p>
	I'd just put it as: a more understanding, more loving communication style.

<p>
	But communication style is only a small component of demonstrating love. Communication style is a rather surface feature.

It is not quite focus nor wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	Awareness would be a better term, but even that is misleading.
</p>

<p>
	The crux of this whole work is that you're not conscious of what consciousness is and that can only be remedied by doing the practices and raising your consciousness more and more until some day you have a total understanding of what it is.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately you'll discover that it is everything.
</p>

<p>
	Until then, if you get confused, a good practice is to pull out your hand, look at it closely, and remind yourself that your hand is made out of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It's paramount to understand that all physical objects are consciousness. This realization frees you from the stranglehold of materialism.
</p>

			I second that. It is the most confusing aspect of all this. On one hand you say everyone doesn't exist, just imaginary characters, that don't even exist when they're not in your direct visual field, and another saying people do exist and each have their own reality and a collective shared consciousness. It seems contradictory. But I'm sure will get explained as simple a strange loop, but would love a in depth explanation of this.

			So if you (God) altered Reality like this to heal every child on the planet, and perform other miracles, would this be experienced by everyone else? Meaning, would these miracles only be in your (Leo's) own dimension/reality, as everyone in your reality is your imagination? Or is reality shared, like it seems, so you making these huge alterations to the world would be experienced by everyone? In which case you would be considered to be like a living God.

<p>
	Yes, by everyone. You would be altering the collective consciousness of all beings. But this is not easy to do.
</p>

<p>
	You can alter the collective consciousness of all beings because you are all beings.
</p>

<p>
	But you'd need to be so conscious that there is no more difference between you, other beings, real, or imaginary.

His morphic resonance theory where his hypothesis is that for example rats in London learns a trick and then rats in New York learns it way faster because it gets remembered in the collective of the species.

<p>
	Somewhat, but it's way more profound than that. There aren't really harmonic fields per se. Consciousness is totally direct. It imagines stuff into being. It's totally mystical. You can't map it out in a scientific or analytic way.

<p>
	Tolerance to psychedelics varies greatly between people. DPT just may not mesh well with your brain or body. Maybe you need a much larger dose. Or maybe it won't work on you at all.
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe your technique is off.
</p>

<p>
	All this requires careful investigation to figure out.
</p>

<p>
	It's worth figuring out.

<p>
	No, no, no!
</p>

<p>
	It's not the DPT. It's what you use it for.
</p>

<p>
	You're not using it with the right intentions. It can only give you as much as you desire of it.
</p>

<p>
	Your desire must be Cosmic Understanding. Forget the music, you must want to UNDERSTAND yourself. ALL. OF. YOURSELF!
</p>

<p>
	Your curiosity must run so deep that you will not stop until you have God's total omniscience and all of the universe accounted for. Seek to understanding EVERYTHING! Cause you can. God can know itself totally, from the smallest to the biggest.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging it is paramount, so you have the time necessary to contemplate. 50-70mg is when it starts to get really amazing for me.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't think you will ever succeed in making a psychedelic peak state stick. At those levels of conscious you could barely function in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Exploring Infinite Consciousness goes beyond a nondual sahaja samadhi state (as great as that is).
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people are awake, let's say, but their understanding of Infinite Consciousness is very minor. They have no idea how deeply the mechanics of God can be understood. I just don't see traditional meditation techniques or self-inquiry taking many people there. Most meditators are after Nibbana or emptiness or whatever, but there is far more to it than that. They never even realize that they are missing because they do not have a means of accessing it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics change the game, expanding it beyond traditional awakening.
</p>

<p>
	I no longer hold Buddhism or Zen in high regard. Their methods and teachings are too weak, too crude, and too shallow.
</p>

<p>
	I released a video on my blog about DPT.
</p>

<p>
	I'll do a more formal video sometime in the future once I understand DPT better. There seems to be a lot to it that's worth exploring. It has not been explored nearly enough by people.
</p>

<p>
	At this point I like it more than 5-MeO-DMT. It is a miracle chemical.

<p>
	It's superhuman levels of consciousness which you're not likely to access without a lot of psychedelic work.
</p>

<p>
	It requires lots of person purification until you're comfortable being selfless enough to access dimensions beyond your human self. All personal psychological baggage and concerns must be jettisoned for the sake higher cosmic understanding.

<p>
	You haven't become conscious of that yet.

<p>
	No, it's not that.
</p>

<p>
	If you think of consciousness as a set of nested hierarchies (cells, organs, people, species, Earth, solar system, etc.) then apparently you can actually tap into, for example, collective cat consciousness. You can tap into how the entire nest is being created. So imagine tapping into all fetuses of all the human mothers who are carrying a child on Earth right now. Or whatever you can imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Creation is not just happening at the level of individual beings. Creation is happening across infinite dimensions all at once. It's hard to explain but you can become conscious of it, and you can even affect it with your Will.
</p>

<p>
	I'm starting to understand how miracles can be made.

			So the drugs could only work that way if you imagined it to be possible? If you've ascended to the above and beyond like full Buddha or Christ then someone injects you daily with fluoride, meth and other neuro toxins would it still not bring you back down to ordinary consciousness or lower if you don't believe it can? I guess that could make sense since many of us I assume have heard the story of ram das, neem karoli baba and the lsd. But it seems like you could be unenlightened that way considering the use of nootropics, a healthy diet and excercise is essential for this work. You have to cleanse the mind and body to make it easier to realize the true self is beyond mind and body. So wouldn't it work in reverse?

<p>
	To be fair, most people in the US disapprove of Trump and he did not even win the popular vote.
</p>

<p>
	He is the most unpopular President of all time. Don't forget that. His base is no more than 40%.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is below the center of gravity of most Americans. Which is why he should lose in a landslide unless the Democrats manage to do something really stupid.

<p>
	Most people who do hatha yoga in the West are Orange transitioning to Green. But they still have a lot of work to do before they become solid Green.
</p>

<p>
	And their politics could easily be one stage lower simply out of political ignorance.

<p>
	My point was, the effectiveness of your training will depend a lot on your pre-existing spiritual attunement and how your brain/mind functions. Imagine doing the same amount of practice but your progress is 100x less. That is more like the reality for many peeps.
</p>

<p>
	The average person cannot climb 10 stages in 1 year. That's pipedreams.
</p>

<p>
	But of course you'll never know until you try, so don't prematurely limit yourself.

<title>Not-self (anatta) vs. depersonalization disorder</title>

<p>
	The key difference is that the awake person is conscious that he is God. The depersonalized person is not.
</p>

<p>
	The depersonalized person also is not conscious enough to see how he is assigning negative meaning to no-self and no-meaning.
</p>

<p>
	No-self is not what people think it is. No-self is only half the story. The other half is Cosmic Self.
</p>

<p>
	The depresonalized person is missing consciousness of the Love of God.
</p>

<p>
	You're not yet understanding what I meant by survival.
</p>

<p>
	You are thinking of survival as some biological evolutionary theory. That is not what we're talking about here. I mean something much more direct and viceral.
</p>

<p>
	To understand you must turn to your direct experience of life and observe how every micro thing you do is a function of survival.
</p>

<p>
	Don't speculate about it, observe it happening in you. It's happening every second.

	We already had too many of these debates. They lead nowhere because people all have their own opinions and personal definitions.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The blissful stage doesn't always come. The blissful stage is the end result of the ego surrendering.
</p>

<p>
	If the ego refuses to surrender don't expect a blissful stage. If there is psychological baggage you must deal with, that won't be blissful, that will be taxing and challenging as you work through it. Then, on future trips you'll be primed for a blissful stage.
</p>

<p>
	Taking psychedelics to experience bliss is not the right attitude. Rather, take them with the expectation of doing emotional work, whatever work is necessary for you to get closer to Truth. The more inner work you do, the more baggage you clear out, the more likely bliss will be in the future.
</p>

<p>
	Think of psychedelics like a therapy session. Challenging stuff should come up. This is how you grow.
</p>

Glad to see some folks on this forum actually doing the practices and developing their concentration skills.
</p>

<p>
	This is how it's done folks! You need to do the practices if you want to be spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	Pick a practice and stick with it until you get good at it. Practices must be done methodologically and consciously, not mechanically to get results.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, truth is not just truth. Truth is extremely radical and has many layers and facets to it. Most egos are not ready to handle the full Truth, they will recoil, freak out, reject, deny, demonize it, etc. To handle the Truth you gotta be at a certain level of development and you need a certain degree of purification of mind.
</p>

<p>
	In practice one has to ease oneself into the Truth. Usually with spiritual work this happens gradually over years and decades. With psychedelics this whole process is short-circuited, thrusting you into the Truth within minutes or hours. With smoked 5-MeO-DMT, it's even worse, you're thrust into Buddha-levels of Truth within seconds. That's way too fast for most people. It can be overwhelming and traumatic if you're not ready.
</p>

<p>
	Not all people have the same capacity to handle Truth. For some it's a lot easier than others. A lot of this has to do with how much ego you've got, how much psychological trauma or baggage you got, and how much you desire Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Most people have a very low desire for Truth, which is why they spend some little time contemplating metaphysical questions.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you smoked it. That will be very confusing. Plugging it is much smoother and clearer and friendlier.
</p>

<p>
	Before you smoke 5-MeO-DMT you should have a lot of experience with other psychedelics. Otherwise you're likely to freak the fuck out. Because your whole reality will be ripped away within seconds.
</p>

<p>
	Start with small doses of mushrooms, LSD, etc. Only after you've explored some of the psychedelic landscape should you attempt smoking 5-MeO. Because it will hit you very hard and very fast.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging small doses is much friendlier and gives you a lot more time to understand what is going on. Blasting yourself into hyperscape is not ideal for our work unless maybe you're already very experienced and comfortable in the psychedelic landscape.
</p>

<p>
	A gentle introduction to psychedelics is VERY IMPORTANT! Gentle is the key for beginners. Which means very small doses and non-smoking methods which come on gradually and give you plenty of time to explore, contemplate, and integrate.
</p>

<p>
	When you're learning to fly you don't just jump into a F-22 jet fighter. You start with a simple, slow, gentle, propeller plane. Learn how flying works before you start doing barrel rolls and the like.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You have only seen a few hairs of the Ox's tail and already the ego is ready to forget all about it.
</p>

<p>
	Doing 5-MeO once is not enough. The lower doses can be more challenging than higher doses since the ego is still there to resist. But with that said, the higher doses can also be very challanging if you are not ready to handle the Truth. The Truth is very radical.
</p>

<p>
	It's not the spirit saying stay away, it's the ego.
</p>

<p>
	But if you feel unready, then don't do it. Sounds like you need to mature more.

<p>
	This is toxic garbage and it has nothing to do with spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	It's all just justifications of a wounded ego stuck in victim mentality building an ideological narrative to protect its own survival.
</p>

<p>
	It's sad to see people taking such narratives seriously.
</p>

<p>
	If you keep watching stuff like this, it will corrupt your mind and make it impossible to grow your consciousness to the highest levels.

<p>
	Yes!
</p>

<p>
	I think you are framing this whole issue in an unresourceful way. Rather than thinking of it as "My death is coming", forget about that and just focus on being really CURIOUS! Be so curious about what consciousness is that death becomes irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	Who cares about death when there is God to explore? Frame it in this positive way. When tripping, replace fear with curiosity.

<p>
	Don't overthink it. It's certainly not done through logic. Logic is there to serve survival.
</p>

<p>
	For me it just comes naturally as a means to my ultimate goal: Truth, Love, and understanding.
</p>

<p>
	If you just desire Truth, and Love, and understanding enough, and work towards that, eventually ego-death will happen and it won't be a big deal.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot with getting confortable with ego death. That is one of their most useful features. You can become so comfortable with it that you don't bat an eye when it happens.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise try years of Kriya yoga.

<p>
	Simple: just do the practices.
</p>

<p>
	You are right, that video cannot be understood at your present level of consciousness. Like I said, it took me some 15 years to get there. And I used some powerful tools along the way without which it would have been impossible for me.
</p>

<p>
	Basically almost no human being is capable of understanding it. Because it is requires transhuman levels of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Getting to the bottom of What is reality? is a HUGE undertaking. You are asking to know how the world is created. This cannot be understood from within the human mind.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it is very frustrating at times. Psychedelics make it 1000x easier.

<p>
	Systems rarely just collapse, they tend to evolve into more conscious systems.
</p>

<p>
	There are schooling styles which mix learning with play. They just aren't widely adopted because we have a factory farm education system right now. But that will change.

	"Bad person" is an egoic judgment.

<p>
	A) I don't know what you mean by that. You are painting with a broad brush here. People experience and realize different things.
</p>

<p>
	Nondual consciousness is not a state of ego, it is the absence of ego, and the realization that your true nature is nothing and everything, or infinite, or God.
</p>

<p>
	There are many people here who are unaware of many things. Just because they have some degree of realization does not mean they are aware of the deeper layers.
</p>

<p>
	Ego dissolution also has layers and degrees of depth to it. The ego is a complex and relentless structure. It takes a lot of deconstruction work to fully get beyond it.
</p>

<p>
	B) Do not start yet another nonduality debate.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, all that is relative.
</p>

<p>
	They are "terrorists" to YOU because you got a survival agenda. To themselves they are not terrorists, they are defenders of their way of life.
</p>

<p>
	In every case a human is simply defending his way of life.
</p>

<p>
	Israel's system is not to kill but to carve out a homeland for themsleves, yes. Killing is a byproduct of that.
</p>

<p>
	I do not support what Israel is doing, but that's my agenda.
</p>

<p>
	It's a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	When that state changes, ego goes poof! like it never was.

<p>
	This just not how reality works.

<p>
	Basically every president makes many killing decisions.

	There isn't a difference between you imagining others and them being "real". That difference is itself imaginary.

<p>
	It's not that things are designed to be destroyed, it's that reality is designed to maximize diversity and beauty. Which requires that no one form monopolize the entire playing field.
</p>

<p>
	Imaigne if the planet was only populated by one animal type. That would be a terrible design.
</p>

<p>
	Maximizing creation requires destruction.

<p>
	This is an extremely problematic & relativistic criteria.
</p>

<p>
	It's virtually impossible for a political leader to take any action which does not prioritize the survival agenda of one group of people over another. This is why politics is so challenging. There are no actions which are 100% favorable to everyone's survival agenda. Government has to balance between various agendas.
