<p>
	In the eyes of God you can do no wrong. In the eyes of humans is a whole nother matter. You will be judged relentlessly by those who have a stake in the game.

<p>
	There are many different ways it can feel:
</p>

<p>
	Like nothing, like becoming the entire universe, like love, like death, like God, awe, horror, like waking up from a dream, like heaven, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Tease her and flirt with her. Be playful in your conversations. Share some stories about yourself with her so she gets a feel for who you are.
</p>

<p>
	THEN you can ask for her number. Don't mention the word "date". You can tell her, "Let's grab a coffee sometime" as you get her number.
</p>

	Learning that delicate balance requires lots and lots of failure. So just go find more girls to flirt with.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	#1 rule with girls: never explicitly tell them about sex. If she's gonna fuck you, she needs to be able to maintain the appearance of being a lady. When you tell her explicitly about sex, you make her feel like a cheap whore, and she will never sleep with you after that.
</p>

<p>
	You must play subtle and coy.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of "You down to fuck?" make it, "Let's get a coffee." Make things sound as innocent as possible. Rather than telling her, "Let's go have sex" tell her, "Let's go watch cartoons".
</p>

<p>
	There is no problem if you wanna fuck. Just don't go telling girls about it. Dating is a game. You gotta flirt and tease your way into her pants.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive. One of the best things you can do is act like you are totally disinterested in sex. You can even tell her, "We are definitely not having sex tonight." Then have sex with her 10 minutes later.
</p>

<p>
	Get good at playing these mind games.
</p>

She doesn't even know you exist. Move on.
</p>

<p>
	A girl who is attracted to you will respond to texts within minutes or hours at most.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot attract girls via text. If she's not responsive it's because you failed to build attraction in person and nothing can be done to overcome that.
</p>

<p>
	You must reach hook-point in person in order to get responsive texts. Try harder to reach hook-point. It's very noticable when you do. Usually happens within 5-10 mins. You will feel her get enthusiastic about you. She will look in your eyes and be very interested in what you have to say. She will be eager to follow your lead.
</p>

<p>
	Do not spend any time thinking about girls who haven't hooked. It will only bring you misery.
</p>

	Pull out your hand. Look closely at it. That is reality. That is God. That is You. Look at it quietly without thinking. Become aware of awareness itself as it displays that hand.

<p>
	Yes, I have worldly obligations. Mostly with my biz (Actualized.org) and you guys. Also a bit of family obligations, but not much.
</p>

<p>
	I am not a social person because I find it too shallow and I like my freedom.
</p>

<p>
	I don't need to talk much about these topics with people/family because I get it out via my videos. The videos are my outlet.
</p>

<p>
	To me social balance looks like living in a cabin in the woods with maybe a girlfriend. And interacting with students via teachings or writing. I don't care for having a social life in the conventional sense.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to emulate this unless it feels natural to you. People have different social preferences. Mystics tend to have an abnormally high tolerance for solitude.
</p>

<p>
	Figure out what you want. What I want is irrelevant to you.
</p>

<p>
	Of course selfish vs selfless is a duality. Ying and yang feeding each other.
</p>

<p>
	Good with a captial G is absolutely everything. If you have to self-actualize to be Good, your notion of Good is far too weak and conditional.
</p>

<p>
	You are Good even if you rape dogs.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness is none other than Love made manifest.

	Of course there's always exceptions. I had a black libertarian friend. Black folks even vote for Trump. Go figure. Lol

<p>
	More generally, libertarianism arises along with Spiral stage Orange, which trumps even race. The Orange value set is fertile soil for a libertarian ideology to arise.

<p>
	No only are days, weeks, months, and years relative, time itself is an invented notion. At one point in your life you had to invent the notion of "time". Before that, time did not exist for you.
</p>

<p>
	Of course as Einstein's relativity shows, even at the physical level, there is no such thing as time. In fact, physics cannot define what time is other than in terms of velocity, which is a circular definition (as all physics definitions are).
</p>

<p>
	Which is why time seems to fly when you're not thinking about it, and seems to crawl when you're wishing it would go faster. You are imagining time.

There's no appreciation of the complexity of human societies, cities, nations, businesses, courts, international trade, warfare, diplomacy, culture, education system, etc. There is no systems thinking. In the libertarian mind everyone is just an individual actor doing whatever he wants as long as it doesn't hurt others.

	Awakening is transcendence of the domain of survival, wherein all problems and suffering lie.

<p>
	Because to be a libertarian requires an enormously previleged life. You have to be so disconnected from the realities of survival that you are clueless about things like racism, rape, abuse, exploitation, slavery, corruption, war, warlords, tribal warfare, gangs, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It sure helps to be a young white male who grew up in the suburbs of America where no one had much of a chance to exploit you.

</p>

<p>
	Ultimate reality cannot be framed in terms of any dualistic statement.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot say, "Reality is like X and not Y." Because reality includes X and Y and transcends both. Both X and Y are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Grasp this, so you stop asking endless silly questions.

<title>Hard time dealing with some kind of awakening</title>

<p>
	You're in a place of confusion because you've only licked the surface of what awakening is. A lot more trips and a lot more contemplation is required to make sense of your trips and come to peace with them.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with how the ego-mind tries to interpret awakening experiences.
</p>

<p>
	If you watch my video: The Many Facets Of Awakening, it can help you make sense of your experiences.

<p>
	You simply need a lot more experience socializing with women.
</p>

<p>
	You're not gonna get good with women by sitting at home thinking about it. Go socialize. You will learn from your mistakes in the field.

<title>Is Software Developer a low social status job?</title>

<p>
	There's nothing wrong with being a software developer. Just don't advertise yourself as such when in the process of wooing women. Don't talk about your job at all. Find other ways to build attraction until she is curious enough to ask you. If a girl really likes you she will naturally ask about your work at some point. You can even use this opportunity to tease her by telling her you do some stupid job like collecting used soda cans by the highway or cleaning toilets at Taco Bell.
</p>

<p>
	Then when you tell her you're a software developer, she will be thrilled.
</p>

<p>
	Be a bit mysterious. Don't give away too much of yourself too fast.
</p>

<p>
	There are certain dangers to activating kundalini without knowing what you're doing. Which is why you should study and learn how to do it and what the dangers are.
</p>

<p>
	But also you should understand that just because you get initiation does not mean you will now avoid the potential dangers of kundalini. You can still have all the same problems even if Sadhguru himself initiates you.

<p>
	Definitely leave "software developer" out of your profile. You ain't gonna attract girls with that.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously do not lie about it if she asks you point blank what you do, but your profile needs to be human, charming, emotional -- not full of anti-social nerd speak.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, girls don't give a damn what you do for a living as long as you're able to hold down a job and pay your bills. She will get attracted to your personality, not your career.
</p>

<p>
	Your profile needs to show (not tell) that you have social savvy and are into human things which don't include computers, video games, TV, and internet.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is so radical it cannot be found on your current plane of consciousness. No amount of thinking will allow you to understand how the mind constructs reality.
</p>

<p>
	The very notion of "things happened in the past" is something Universal Mind is imaging right now.

<p>
	The past is imagined in the present. This is crucial to notice.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine that your body came out of your mother. Imagination is indistiguishable from reality. So by imagining it hard enough it becomes real from your POV. But it has no absolute reality. Your body's birth is a relative truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you stop imagining you have a mother, you will literally not have a mother. Amazing but true.

You keep conflating relative and absolute domains in contexts which are clearly relative.
</p>

<p>
	What OP needs to become conscious of is that his notions of good/bad, right/wrong are self-biased and totally relative, invented by his ego-mind to aid survival of the ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	This is a crucial realization for liberation. Without this realization one will forever remain judgmental and enslaves to social conditioning.
</p>

<p>
	No peace is possible so long as one believes in right and wrong.

<p>
	Morality is something your mind invented to aid its survival. Which is obvious if you just reflect a little. This is why no two people agree on what is right and wrong. For everything you think is evil, there will be at least one person who thinks it is good.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you are so gullible you believe your own mind's biases.

	Because corporations have bought the government. We need to pass a consitutional amendment to ban all money in elections. Corporations basically need to be de-fanged. A corporation should have zero voting power.

<p>
	Loopholes can be closed. It's not like corporations can escape taxation if we really wanted to tax them. A wealth tax is not necessary. We could simply create a new tax on all corporate profits. We know the profits of all publically traded companies so this is not something they could run away from or hide.
</p>

<p>
	We could also have special taxes on business transactions between large corporations.
</p>

<p>
	There could be a merger tax, where the gov gets large tax if one business buys another one.
</p>

I would do a full UBI for everyone and tax gaint corporations more to pay for it. Simple and clean. I don't understand why Yang can't be so straight forward about it. This makes me suspicious of him.

	Yang's UBI is regressive is some ways. That was Anna's point. And it's a valid point. Why not give people on disability the full UBI? People who earn $1 billion a year will get the full UBI but people on disability will not???

<p>
	Fundamentally duality is created by one division. One division is the bare minimum to break oneness. Duality refers to any number of divisions beyond one. Duality includes triality and anything other than oneness.

	Dark night of the soul. It is normal for the ego-mind to go through a fit here.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel depressed about meaninglessness, you're still giving it meaning. Your work is not complete. There is deeper to go.

<p>
	Be ware of taking on ideas like meaninglessness or infinity. These things are not ideas.

</blockquote>

<p>
	First of all, we have little idea of what techniques Jesus taught. Many of them may have been lost to history.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, the techiques are not important as long as one reaches nondual consciousness. Whatever works is fine. I support any technique that gets one there, as long as it doesn't harm others.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like Jesus did a 30 day vision quest, fasting out in the desert. That's hardcore, but a well-known technique. That is like meditation on steroids.

<p>
	I have no faith that she will fight hard for serious progressive domestic reforms. She hardly talks about them. All she talks about is war and military issues.
</p>

<p>
	She's fairly conservative in her outlook.
</p>

<p>
	I trust that Bernie or Warren will not start any wars. So what's the point of Tulsi? Not starting war is like the bare minimum in a candidate. I don't sense that she has any original domestic plans. If she does, she hasn't communicated it.

<p>
	My teachings are in no way Eastern. They are equally Western. There is no difference between East and West, Buddha and Christ.

			If children are "blind survival machines," then why is it that they seem to have less fear than adults? They seem to care less about survival and focus more on play. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Because adults fear for them. Adults handle most of the child's survival needs (if the adults are good), which affords the child the luxury of play and being.
</p>

<p>
	Of course a child has less to fear because they don't know how dangerous the world is yet. In this case ignorance is bliss. But it cannot last.

<p>
	That's a potential problem. But so is the opposite: thinking it will be a breeze.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I don't actively go into it thinking, "Okay, this will be hell." I just have a reasonable expectation that the awakening process will be difficult, like climbing Mt Everest or running a marathon. You gotta come to it prepared.
</p>

<p>
	And my focus is not on the suffering of it, but on pursuing Truth, Consciousness, and Love. Your goal should be a positive one.

<title>Christopher M. Bache: LSD (500-600mcg) vs. 5-MeO-DMT</title>

<p>
	You could do 8 back to back sessions of 5-MeO-DMT. But 1 is usually hard enough.
</p>

<p>
	I find value in various kinds of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is most remarkable in its clarity. A high dose of LSD will get very visually wacky. You won't be able to see straight. But sure, it would also produce a lot of healing.
</p>

<p>
	LSD can be awesome.
</p>

<p>
	It's all good. Find what works for you.

<p>
	Clearly you've never had a bad trip.
</p>

<p>
	Yes! Of course mystical experiences can be like psychotic breakdowns. Deep awakening is basically like losing your mind. Which is why so few people do it.
</p>

<p>
	The process of awakening is gonna be hell. Peace comes at the end, after you're dead and have completely lost your mind.

<p>
	It all depends. There are many possibilities:
</p>

<p>
	1) The guru is just an abusive asshole and a fake.
</p>

<p>
	2) The guru is somewhat awakened but still full of egoic impurities, not having finished his development and mastery.
</p>

<p>
	3) The guru genuinely believes he's helping his students. Maybe he is helping, maybe not. This can vary.
</p>

<p>
	4) The guru is genuinely helping his students but his students take it personally, have an ego-backlash, and project a lot of their own shit on the guru. In this case the guru is totally fine, but the student is just not capable of handling the teachings. The student is in over his head and lashes out at the guru.
</p>

<p>
	5) The accusations are exaggerated or entirely false. The student may misunderstand what the guru was doing.
</p>

<p>
	6) There may simply be a misalignment between the guru's style and the student's style. Which could easily be solved by finding a different guru without disparaging the old guru.
</p>

<p>
	All the above can happen. Rarely are things black and white. Rarely is a guru a total fake.
</p>

<p>
	No, the whole point is that it is NOT miserable. Your mind constructs pain, suffering, and misery.
</p>

<p>
	You are not understanding how deep this work goes.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being so conscious that someone could break your finger and it would not be miserable to you.
</p>

<p>
	That is the depth of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Now, how to actualize that is the trick. It ain't easy. But we can work towards it.

<p>
	That's not quite true. Some teachers and gurus are genuinely abusive, ill-informed, or corrupt.
</p>

<p>
	You do have to pick your teachers carefully. The wrong teacher could seriously screw you up. But just having the right teacher is also not sufficient because there are so many ways you could screw up and mis-apply the teachings.
</p>

<p>
	It's wise to cross-reference teachers and teachings to make sure you cover all possible blindspots and biases.

<p>
	There's predicable pattern that happens with students. First they fall in love with the teachings. Then after a while they fall out of love because they need to differentiate themselves to grow and become their own Self.
</p>

<p>
	It's very much like a teen leaving the nest and rebelling against his parents in order to forge his own identity.
</p>

<p>
	"Fuck you Dad! You don't get to tell me what to do any more!"
</p>

<p>
	Okay, son. Go do what you gotta do.
</p>

<p>
	I told you from the beginning not to rely on me as your only source. But you didn't listen.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard for people to get that I am completely irrelevant in this work. None of this is about me. I do not matter. The one making this about me, is you. Because you deny our own authority you need some daddy figure to project it onto.

<p>
	No, birth itself is the delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Children are closer to God in that their minds have not yet been filled with bullshit beliefs and ideologies.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget how selfish children and animals are. They are not angles nor do they behave consciously. They are blind survival machines.

<p>
	That's only 1000 approaches. Not nearly enough to get good. After 1000 approaches you will still mostly suck, but maybe you'll have a few lucky hookups.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to get good you should be doing 20 approaches per night. And it will takes you 3-5 years.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, getting really good isn't necessary.

<p>

<p>
	This is an absurd false equivalency. Obama has no business interests in Russia and Obama has high integrity. Trump's entire career hinged on Russian money and Trump as zero integrity. Trump would not refuse Russian help if it was offered. In fact, it was offered, and he and his son were eager to accept it.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	"Collusion" is a misleading word. The collusion wasn't necessarily one where Trump and Putin sat in a room and actively hatched a plan to win the election (although even that is within the realm of possibility with Trump). More likely it was simply a tacit understanding that this serves both their best interests. The way Mafia does business is mostly tacitly. The boss doesn't need to tell his staff to kill someone or bring him money. Everyone understands what the game is. So no explicit collusion is necessary. In fact it's best to avoid it to reduce chances of being caught. That's how business is done at Stage Red. You're not going to find a paper trail.

			Racism is a tricky thing, and not really that straightforward IMO. It’s possible to be racist in some contexts and not in others. It’s why people can have friends of other races and then go home and complain about “other races ruining their country.” In this instance they see their friends as human and close relationships, but then see broad ethnic groups as just a vague idea that’s somehow bad for their civilisation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Its like how there’s a lot of Hispanic Trump voters who want a wall to keep Hispanic migrants out. They themselves might look like and even be related to these migrants, but due to a number of different cultural factors they end up identifying with the dominate, ethno-cultural group they inhabit (and some of the racist ideas this group holds.)
		</p>

		<p>
			So as for Stella’s father, I’d say it’s possible for him to both marry a Puerto Rican woman and hold discriminatory views against Native Americans. The contexts around each relationship are different, and it’s these relationships that her father’s ego can accept or not accept (marrying someone from a Hispanic US territory vs having his daughter date someone from a discriminated minority that also has a lot of social ills within its own community.)
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This!
</p>

<p>
	Marrying a Puerto Rican woman don't mean shit.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is clever enough to compartmentalize and make such justifications as part of its self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	"Look, I can't be a heartless rich person because I donate money to the poor once a year." Lol. The mind is masterful at such bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	A slave-owner might genuinely tell himself, "How can I be a racist when I have sex with my slaves? And I treat them so well!"
</p>

<p>
	The mind will never accept the label "racist" because it's far too ugly to admit that. So denial all the way to the grave.

			Ok, so because of this, you're saying the Russians wanted him so that he can do their bidding? And if so, how did they know or plan to get this reality talk show host to beat every Republican in the 2016 primary and know he would face off against Hillary Clinton all those years ago? And if they did know this and achieved it, why hasn't Trump done their bidding this entire time while he was in office?

	The Russians are just manipulators, exploiters, and opportunists. Of course they couldn't know Trump would win. They got a very lucky break.  But now that they got it, they will use it to their utmost.

	Hillary was an existential threat to Putin. She would have plotted to undermine and overthrow him.
