<p>
	Oh, it's gonna get a lot worse. This is only the tip of the iceberg of Trump's criminality.
</p>

<p>
	If the public only knew how much criminal stuff Trump has done, they would come for him with pitchforks.
</p>

<p>
	Trump has been skating on thin ice for years now and he's about to fall through.

			Im not underestimating the potential harm of having no way of safely storing nuclear waste but it is all adressed in this talk. Problems that nuclear energy causes are real, they are just not comparable to emission and damage of coal energy plants, or even solar panels. Really eye-opening talk

<p>
	It's a good video. Makes some good points.
</p>

<p>
	I wonder though how bad a nuclear meltdown can get, and how bad a leak of nuclear waste can be once we have a 1000x more nuclear plants.
</p>

<p>
	Chernobyl and Fukushima might be the tip of the iceberg. If some nuclear plant leaks all of its waste into the ocean, how bad would that be?

</p>

<p>
	Now you are looking for where it ran off to.
</p>

<p>
	This is a very common stage.
</p>

<p>
	It goes more deep than can be explained to you. So keep tracking that Ox. You have not even seen its body yet.

<title>Would someone share their thoughts on these vaccine statistics?</title>

<p>
	Of course vaccines were good for mankind overall. I don't think anyone disputes that.
</p>

<p>
	The question is, how do we make them even better?
</p>

<p>
	Yes, gasoline cars were very helpful for mankind.
</p>

<p>
	But now it's time to upgrade to electric cars which should come with less harmful side effects.
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem is, even if vaccines save 10 million lives for every 1 life they destroy, if you're the mother or father of a child who will get destroyed, you're not gonna take it quietly. Statistics are no consolation when your luck runs out.
</p>

<p>
	I don't understand why all-organic vaccines can't be produced. Do we really need mercury in there? Or is that just some cost-cutting measure?
</p>

<title>Self-Realization vs Self-Actualization</title>

<p>
	Self-transcendence is just the final step in Maslow's pyramid. One step above self-actualization.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make self-actualization and self-transcendence at odds with one another. They work together.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, to fully actualize yourself you must fully transcend yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The first half of this journey you spend actualizing your human self.
</p>

<p>
	The second half of this journey you spend actualizing your God Self.
</p>

<p>
	#1 leads to #2. And then #2 undoes #1. It's hard to undo #1 until you do #1. Most people need a lot more work doing #1 before they can even entertain #2.

<p>
	How could God not be curious about itself?
</p>

<p>
	God is too amazing and too mysterious to not be curious about itself.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you went to sleep in your bed and then magically woke up the next day on an alien planet. You would naturally be extremely curious to explore it. You wouldn't wake up and be like, "Oh, it's just some alien planet. Boring! I'm going back to sleep." Instead you'd say, "OMG! WTF is this? Let's look around. This is amazing stuff!"

<title>The fear of being surpassed intellectually</title>

	That's a very good insight about your fear.

			For each new insight, I feel like I'm growing and seeing things more clearly. So I feel like I can never get enough. The hunger is insatiable. But at the same time, there's this fear of not doing it. And that makes me wonder what lies on the other side. It could be growth, or it could be stagnation. It seems like I just have to take the plunge in order to find out.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But you must take it deeper. What is it about your identity which allows this fear to have any teeth at all for you?
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you've somehow made intellect an significant part of your identity (of who you think you are). So you fear losing that sense of intellectual self.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate that. Try to get more clear about it.
</p>

<p>
	And of course you know the ultimate solution here will be to surrender that intellectual self. You must bite the bullet that you will have no intellectual advantage over anyone else. At first you will resist accepting this because it will feel like a serious loss of meaning. You will feel like your life will become worse as a result. It will feel empty. But that emptiness is Truth. That emptiness is the True Self which you are avoiding. That emptiness leads to liberation.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, a big part of waking up is surrendering meaning. Especially those things in life you find most meaningful, which for you probably means the meaning which comes with intellectual pursuits and knowledge acquisition. Notice that knowledge acquisition is a subtle form of greediness and materialism. Like the businessman hoards money the intellectual hoards ideas and insights.
</p>

<p>
	Hoarding of ideas and insights must ultimately be surrendered to attain the final liberation. Because your truest Self is more empty and insubstantial than an insight or a piece of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	Of course don't make the mistake of demonizing or rejecting insight. Just don't build an identity out of it. That's all.
</p>

<p>
	But relatively speaking, basically everything causes epigenetic change. So that doesn't mean much.

	Hehe, after the deep topics we cover here and with psychedelics, therapy will seem like child's play.

	The only way it could work is if you find a REALLY good therapist, not the typical hack.

<p>
	Obviously you guys are still too afraid.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is conquered by facing it.
</p>

<p>
	See my recent videos on fear.
</p>

<p>
	You got a lot more tripping to do and inner work to do before your mind is ready to surrender. You're in just the early stages of this work. So just keep chipping away at it.
</p>

<p>
	Try to not think of it as death so much. Death is not real. Reframe it as waking up to yourself as God. This will make it less scary.
</p>

<p>
	If you watch Part 2 you will see I said exactly that: all fear is fear of one self. Which is to say, all fear is fear of one's own mind.
</p>

<p>
	All those "external" things you fear are your own mind which you have disowned.

	Kriya yoga is good for this. It's less mental and more physical.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try using binural beats as training wheels to build yourself up.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation is very difficult in the beginning.

	Philippines is a very stage Blue country. Stage Blue is too traditional and conformist to understand homosexuality. Stage Blue is very sexually repressed.
</p>

<p>
	You guys will argue about the issue for 50 years until you finally accept it as normal, just like all modern 1st world countries have done. And when you grand children look back on it, they will wonder what all the fuss was about.

	I'm not really concerned with meeting people's definitions but just exploring my own consciousness deeper and deeper. I've sort of given up on the idea of attaining some permanent end-state. I'm always becoming conscious of more and more stuff, so I'm just following that wherever it leads me.

<p>
	I don't have any formal practice right now. I just live life and try to be conscious.
</p>

<p>
	But this is not good advice to follow for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	Your practice will change depending on where you are in your path. So be careful comparing yourself to others. Find what you need right now.

<p>
	Nonduality is not a belief.
</p>

<p>
	Bad trips on DMT are no different really than good trips. A bad trip is nothing more than the tripper getting scared of his own shadow. If you take too much DMT too fast you will scare yourself, of course.

		<p>
			Hello.
		</p>

		<p>
			After 18 months of self-actualization which includes <em>meditation on a daily basis, reading, writing, mindfulness</em> and so forth, I still have a <u>deep</u> inner resistance when it comes to studying and trying to memorize facts.
		</p>

		<p>
			What I find strange is the fact that I can meditate pretty well and I can stay in the present moment for a long time without resistance. I have to admit that it was hard to reach this point where I can meditate everywhere, even at my work which is a pretty randy place.
		</p>

		<p>
			What bothers me is the feeling that I'll never be able to achieve a pleasant state (meaning a state of flow) when I'm studying the things that seem interesting to me.
		</p>

		<p>
			I want to be able to enjoy studying without resistance because it's very important for me to be a life-long learner. How can I become a good communicator if I'm not able to process and assimilate information very well?
		</p>

		<p>
			How many of you do have this inner resistance when studying?
		</p>

		<p>
			How many of you lack motivation when it comes to learning new stuff?
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm almost at a point of desperation and I mean that.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any suggestions to achieve a state of flow when I need to learn new information?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are getting in your own way. Your own ideals of being a good learner is precisely the thing which is tripping you up here. You are not allowing yourself to fully immerse in the flow of learning because you're too busy trying to live up to the image in your mind of being a good learner. This imagine creates all sorts of artificial requirements like memorization and other formalities which you then resist.
</p>

<p>
	Try learning in a less structured or rigid way. If you really enjoy learning, just do it. Learn in a joyful way without worrying about how that has to look. Perhaps memorization is not necessary at all. Perhaps finishing every book from cover to cover is not necessary either. Perhaps there are totally new ways to learn which you are not even allowing yourself to explore because you've got some rigid image in your mind of what learning has to look like. For example, maybe real learning might look like taking a vacation to another country and going to a bar for drinks with some new people you met, rather than sitting at home memorizing a book. Perhaps real learning is taking psychedelics in the middle of the jungle.
</p>

<p>
	As you go deeper into self-actualization work you have to find ways of doing it which feel organic and natural to you. It can't be like following some check list of mechanical rules.
</p>

<p>
	Telling yourself that "I must watch more self-help videos" will create resistance since its such a forced way of doing things.
</p>

<p>
	You must learn to listen more to your feelings rather than to your shoulds & rules. Your feeling tell you what you need to do when. But this requires getting attuned to hearing their subtle cues. For example in your case now your feelings are telling you that your method of learn is too artificial and forced, which is why you're frustrated.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I forced you to have sex every day and if you didn't have sex at the times I wanted you to, in the exact ways I wanted you to, I would give you a strong electric shock. This would quickly take all the joy out of sex. After a few months of this you'd start to hate the idea of sex.

<p>
	The democrats HAVE found ground and they have made a ton of serious policy proposals. Trump has no serious policy proposals other than anti-immigrant ones.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be making false equivalencies.
</p>

<p>
	The democrats have some of the best and most progressive candidates running in the history of the US. What more do you want? George Washington to crawl out of his grave and join the democratic debates? As soon as he learns about Trump he would crawl back into his grave and stay there.
</p>

<p>
	If people are stupid enough to vote for Trump a second time, nothing can save us. That ain't the democrats fault.

	How do you know? What if it is?
</p>

<p>
	What if your body is imaginary? How would you tell the difference if all you've ever experienced your whole life has been imagination?
</p>

<p>
	What if the very thing you think is real has always just been something you've been imagining to be real?
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine a thing to be real, does that mean it is real? Or is it still imaginary?
</p>

<p>
	How would you distinguish between you imagining something to be real vs it actually being real?

Right now it seems like the MSM is coalescing around Warren and she's picking up a lot of the failed centrist candidate's voters too, while Bernie is being deliberately ignored. I saw a while ago you betting someone that Bernie would win the election, and I feel silly for saying this but this is what I've been basing the last few months of my political analysis around. Now, I'm not so sure. What do you make the situation?

<p>
	It's certainly possible that Warren steals his votes.
</p>

<p>
	I see a big problem with Warren and Bernie splitting the progressive votes, giving Biden the nomination.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind that it's too early right now. Polls don't mean much yet.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie will win the election against Trump. But will he even get to face Trump? That's a big IF. Biden and Warren are both stronger than I hoped in the polls.
</p>

<p>
	When I endorsed Bernie I didn't even know Biden would run. I was hoping he wouldn't. Biden really has no business running in this election. He's clearly just doing it because he's got nothing better to do.

<p>
	The desire to manipulate reality to suit yourself is the very definition of ego.
</p>

<p>
	But also, you are able to bend many rules as you become more conscious. You just have to appreciate that your personal human desires are not what governs the universe. There is a deep intelligence to how everything is arranged, so think twice before imposing your human ideas on how the universe should be.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe one day you'll discover that everything is perfect exactly how it is and that nothing needs to be manipulated. Imagine that! What a concept!

<p>
	I wouldn't call that racist. Politics is tricky and many politicians aren't able to keep their promises for reasons other than racism.
</p>

<p>
	Wearing costumes when abroad is fairly typical for leaders.
</p>

<p>
	Racism is a pretty serious charge that requires solid evidence.

<p>
	I don't know of his "racist actions" besides the face paint. By all means share if you have some evidence.
</p>

<p>
	I'm much more open to hearing about actual systemic racist policy vs face paint. I prefer to criticize politicians on their terrible policies than personal gaffs.

	Trump is a bit of an exception because he is so clearly a morally bankrupt devil. But even Trump I have compassion for. He's doing the best he can.

			So, it's not just as simple as smudging some make-up on their face. These mocking behaviors are actually very harmful and perpetuate all kinds of stereotypes. And if we give it a pass (especially from a world leader) and open the door for this type of behavior, other more serious forms of racism and willful forms of racism will take more of a foothold in society.

<p>
	I agree that racism is still a problem.
</p>

<p>
	But I don't think it's right to ruin Trudeau's career for make up he wore to a party 15 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	I feel the voters of Canada can sort that out. It's been made public so now people can render their verdict at the ballot box.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget there are worse candidates in Canada than Trudeau who might win if he is tarred and feathered out of town. Canadian nationalism seems to be on the rise and a Trump-like Canadian president is not out of the realm of possibility, who would make Trudeau look like an angel.

<p>
	Dude, don't be so hard on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel lonely there's nothing wrong with finding some people to socialize with. In a sense that lonely feeling is telling you: "Hey dummy! You should socialize more!"
</p>

<p>
	What's inauthentic is desiring to socialize with someone but then not doing it out of fear that they will reject you. The authentic thing would be to walk over and say, "Hey, I was looking for a new friend and I saw you. So here I am. Please don't reject me or I will have to hang myself in my mother's basement with her vacuum cleaner cord."
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>BE MORE VULNERABLE WITH STRANGERS!</u></strong>

	There's not really much to discuss here. Try various techniques and discover what works best for you.
</p>

<p>
	And just keep an open mind that what works best for you will not necessarily work best for others. People's minds work in very different ways.

<p>
	That's technically true. But it's highly misleading.
</p>

<p>
	When I applied to CalTech by in my high school days I called them to ask what GPA I need to get in. They told me, "We have no GPA requirement." That's technically true. You can apply with a 3.5 GPA. But if your GPA is below 4.0, you ain't getting in. So be careful about kidding yourself.
</p>

<p>
	There are definitely things you can do to increase your odds of enlightenment. If this wasn't true, your teachers would be out of a job. Ralston holds enlightenment workshops. Obviously because he believes this increases your odds of enlightenment.

<p>
	Such things are not mere entertainment. They are part of this work.

<p>
	Be careful about holding language as contradictory to Truth or awakening. Awakening can infuse itself into language. Some great spiritual texts have been written and channeled. And they ain't just stories and BS. There is serious truth and wisdom in them.

<p>
	For example, it is possible to communicate directly with God. Of course this will involve language.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well of course that can happen. As Ralston said, you can get enlightened while falling in a bathtub.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of random shit can happen. If you facilitate 1000 students some of them will accidentally get enlightened by picking their nose. But that's a red herring. That doesn't mean you should bank on "picking your nose" to enlighten you.
</p>

<p>
	Not all spiritual techniques are of equal efficacy. Some are really really ineffective. So my point is, find what is most effective for you.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are unique is that they are exceptionally effective. Same for meditation & yoga.
</p>

<p>
	Watching cartoons is not effective. Although even that could work once in a billion people.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston is also wrong. It is possible to invent a method for enlightenment (at least a temporary one). And 5-MeO-DMT is it.
</p>

<p>
	To call 5-MeO-DMT a mere change in state is very very misleading. Make sure you do it before you say such things. And it's not good enough to toy around with it. You gotta seriously do it. You gotta hit a breakthrough. I'm tried of people talking about 5-MeO who have not had a breakthrough. Trying a psychedelic don't mean shit. You gotta have that breakthrough. Lots of people have tried meditation but that doesn't mean anything. Trying it is not good enough. You must actualize its full potential. And that requires some serious effort, not a casual experiment.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind there are some people on whom 5-MeO-DMT seems to have no to little effect due to their genetics or whatever. So their dud experiments don't count.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston's teachings are very advanced and most of you will simply not be able to actualize what he is talking about. So watch out. There is good reason why spiritual techniques were invented. Most people need them.
</p>

			I’ve met and have friends now whom are deeply enlightened and have taken psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT for example AFTER their own enlightenment and it’s the same answer every time “it’s a cosmic <b><u>state</u></b> of ignorance. This isn’t enlightenment.” That speaks WAY more than people taking substances and experiences crazy states whom aren’t enlightened and never even had enlightenment experiences thinking that they now know what they’re talking about. This isn’t to say psychedelics are not helpful for human stuff like healing, emotional work, psychological work, getting past certain issues. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You're not quite understanding how psychedelics work.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>There is nothing but states of consciousness.</u></strong> So you cannot escape states of consciousness since consciousness is the only thing that exists. There are just many different states and then there is understanding of how consciousness works.
</p>

<p>
	The point of a psychedelic is not to put you into a crazy state of consciousness per se. It's to reveal how consciousness works.
</p>

<p>
	The practical reality is that your state very much affects what you're able to become conscious of. If you're stuck in a bad state, you're basically fucked. You will not be capable of doing what Ralston says. In fact, basically no one is capable of doing the stuff Ralston says because their state is inadequate.
</p>

<p>
	The point of meditation and yoga is to permanently up your state so you have a reasonable chance of doing what Ralston takes for granted you can do.
</p>

<p>
	Although enlightenment is not directly limited to a state, one's state is really important for success in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck getting enlightened while you're in some PTSD state, depressed state, or opioid addicted state.
</p>

<p>
	States run your whole life. So dismiss states at your own peril.
</p>

	This stuff is so predictable it's like clockwork.
</p>

<p>
	I feel bad saying "I told you so".

<p>
	These cults can be smelled from a thousand miles away to anyone who's seriously doing this work. Unfortunately virtually no one is seriously doing this work.

<p>
	It's very different because on the one hand you have a serious climate catastrophe which is being made worse through denial and indifference. On the other hand you have Trudeau wearing some brown face paint at a dress up party.
</p>

<p>
	Sending a mob after Trudeau is overkill. Giving a stark and impassioned speech to the UN about climate change is appropriate.
</p>

<p>
	Let's get our priorities in order.

<title>Is fear a concept about the past too?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/40082-is-fear-a-concept-about-the-past-too/?do=findComment&amp;comment=502842</link>

<p>
	Fear is always about the future.
</p>

<p>
	You don't fear your past rape. You fear having to experience that again.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you are afraid of your memories of that event, what you fear is re-living that experience (via your memories) in the future.
</p>

<p>
	So even fear of a memory is fear of the future, not the past. Because fear is fundamentally resistance to future experience. If something has already been experienced, or is being currently experienced, it is not feared, since it's already here there is no need to fear it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't believe me. Explore how fear actually works in your direct experience. Notice whether your fear is actually of the past, the present, or the future. This requires some good mindfulness skill.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to turn this into speculation about how fear works. Do not speculate or guess! Actually look at what fear is doing in your direct experience. There's no room for guesswork here.
</p>

<p>
	Is fear about the past or the future? Don't guess! Check what your fear is doing.
</p>

<p>
	Shaming some folks in a UN speech is one thing, sicking a mob onto a political leader for a minor past mistake to get revenge is another thing.
</p>

<p>
	This requires a delicate balancing act. I don't think people should be fired for minor mistakes, like what happened with Al Franken. Sure, he made some mistakes, but did it really deserve a firing?
</p>

<p>
	We need some way of repremanding a person without destroying their whole career.

</p>

<p>
	Don't worry so much about getting a breakthrough. That will come naturally once you are ready for it. The way you get ready for it is by doing smaller trips, contemplating deeply, doing other practices, and taking time to integrate each trip.
</p>

<p>
	Do 10-20 smaller trips and integrate all those insights. Then you'll be ready for a breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	You're trying to go too fast and your psyche isn't equipped to handle it.
</p>

<p>
	This work is a marathon, not a sprint.
</p>

<p>
	It took me about 1 year to integrate my highest dose (30mg) 5-MeO-DMT trip. Now I can handle a lot more (not dosage-wise but insight-wise).
</p>

<p>
	It all comes down to this key question: How much mindfuck can your psyche handle?
</p>

<p>
	The mindfuck goes much deeper than anyone expects. It blindsides you and you don't even know what happened because Truth is such a mindfuck.
</p>

	There exists no storage solution for radioactive nuclear waste. Think about that. You want to build radioactive material that will last for 10,000 years with no plan for what to do with it.

<p>
	How about we first exhaust solar and wind. Then if we still need more energy we can consider nuclear.
</p>

<p>
	In the long run solar is the ultimate energy source. We just need to scale it up massively.

<p>
	Very few Buddhists understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	Buddhism still has a lot of dogma in it. Even when people speak of the classical Buddhist enlightenment, they speak of it dogmatically, not from deep personal experience.
</p>

<p>
	And even if they've had some degree of awakening, it's still far shy of full God mode.
</p>

<p>
	So in practice 99.999% of Buddhists don't fully understand their own teachings.

	Yeah, but a lot of foolish people have done mushrooms without realizing their full significance. So that means little.

	As a general rule I don't like to smoke anything to avoid harming the lungs.

<p>
	If I was gonna do weed, I would take a pure THC extract tincture sublingually.

<p>
	This is where it gets very problematic. The hive mind can be very ignorant and evil, and also easily manipulated by power hungry devils.

	We have to be careful not to ruin people's careers over minor gaffs and bits of foolishness.
</p>

<p>
	If he was a proper racist I would agree, kick him out of office. But I don't think that is the right reaction in this case.
</p>

<p>
	It is important that we allow room for public servants and celebrities to grow and mature. I like when a public figure is able to admit his past mistakes and grow from them. This is necessary in a society where people are self-actualizing. Otherwise no one will admit their mistakes because they will be too scared to get rejected or mauled by the hive mind.
</p>

<p>
	I think pubic figures should only be fired if they did something significantly bad and they refuse to accept responsiblity and grow from it.
</p>

<p>
	We don't want a society where we tar and feather people for minor offenses.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Trump deserves to be kicked out of office because he is unapologetic about anything he does and he refuses to correct his ways. I don't think Trudeau is in the same ballpark. I think this brown face scandal will make him a better person overall. He seems to regret his actions. These kind of scandals are actually helpful for the evolution of our culture as a consensus develops that blackface is hurtful and racist. Believe it or not, many people don't know that yet. People who did not grow up in the South aren't that familiar with blackface. For example, I never even heard that term until a few years ago.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No. Relative truth in this case would be for scientists to get to bottom of whether vaccines have any harmful side effects. If they do, that is a relative truth. If they don't, that is a relative truth.
</p>

<p>
	The solution here is simple: invest a lot more money studying the subtle side effects of vaccines with an open mind. See what the research reveals. Or maybe just invent new vaccines which use less toxic substances in their creation. I hear some vaccines contaim stuff like mercury. Of that's true, that's probably harmful to folks. So find a way to make non-toxic vaccines.
</p>

<p>
	This is really a scientific problem. The trick is that we need much better science. Right now science is too materialistic and corrupted by corporate funding so it's hard to trust. You can appreciate why stage Greem hippies are skeptical of science. There is plenty of terrible scientific research on nutrition, for example. Nutrition science and drug science is very skewed by corporate money, lobbying, and fear-mongering.

	Thoughts are only a problem if you get lost in them. Otherwise thoughts are a beautiful thing and are important to human life.

<p>
	This is where you need to distinguish between relative truth vs absolute truth.
</p>

<p>
	Of course vaccines and children are imaginary in the absolute sense. But relatively speaking, there is a legit scientific question about whether vaccines cause negative health side effects. This question is yet to be settled, which is why people argue over it. But even once it is settled, in the absolute sense all of this is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: when you are writing a plot for a novel there arises the question of whether your plot is consistent with itself or self-contradictory. But either way, the entire thing is a work of imagination.

<p>
	I meant, it needs to be the most meaningful thing out of the things you could be working on.
</p>

<p>
	Unless you are a billionaire, you don't have a choice in life. You will have to work to make money. The only question is, will you work on things you find most meaningful or not?
</p>

<p>
	Even if you value deep relationships, you'll still have to work. Because work IS survival. You cannot be alive and avoid survival. The only question is, what will be the quality of your survival? Are you gonna be scamming old ladies out of their life savings, are you gonna be selling poison at McDonald's, or are you gonna do something meaningful for the world?
</p>

<p>
	Up to you.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be surprised if you hate your life when you sell poison at McDonald's for 8 hours every day. You <u>should</u> hate your life at that point because what you're doing is so stupid. That hate is a message that God is sending you. God is telling you, "Why you being so stupid when you could be doing something so much more amazing with your life?"
</p>

<p>
	Living life in stupid ways leads to lots of suffering.

<p>
	You have to realize that there is something beyond your mind which you will never access via language or thought. But it can be accessed. Just not by thinking.

<p>
	Exactly.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful throwing pearls before swine. Most people are not worthy to be told what spirituality is. They are too selfish to understand the communication.

<p>
	You're thinking about work all wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than seeing is as something you have to do, find a way to make it something you love to do.
</p>

<p>
	In general, don't do things because you have to, do them because you want to.
</p>

<p>
	This means being proactive about your work. It's not really work then, it's creativity. Don't you want to be creative? Why not? You are God after all! You created the whole universe and creation is a beautiful and exciting process.
</p>

<p>
	You're disconnected from your creativity. That's your problem. Find a way to reconnect and this issue about work will dissolve. Then your problem will be that you work too hard!
</p>

<p>
	Your work needs to be the most meaningful thing in the world to you.
</p>

<p>
	You have yet to realize the significance of life purpose. You know it only as an intellectual abstraction, not a tangible burning passion.
</p>

<p>
	Right, you're hallucinating that.
</p>

<p>
	You just aren't conscious enough yet to see it.
</p>

<p>
	Your skepticism seems justified from your POV. But your entire POV is an illusion, which invalidates your own skepticism.
</p>

<p>
	Einstein was not awake. So using his words here only drives you deeper into the illusion.

<p>
	No, you just don't like the answer I'm giving you.
</p>

<p>
	It's too radical for your taste. Your mind still thinks it can outsmart God. Give it up.
