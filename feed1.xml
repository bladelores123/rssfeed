	In Vegas, during the summer months, the Luxor hotel's giant beam of light at night attracts the fattest moths ever. They circle around the beam like eagles.

	I didn't say he mastered them all.
</p>

<p>
	By your own logic, if he is a specialist he shouldn't have mastered them all.
</p>

<p>
	If would be like if I said some scientist is a technical master in molecular biology. And you reply with: "But there are thousands of sciences, can you really master them all?"
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to master them all to be considered a great scientist. The opposite is the case.

That's how projection works. When you do it, you tell yourself the other is doing it to you. The perfect self-deception.

<p>
	I address libertarianism a lot because no mater how extreme or moderate it is, the people who hold such an ideology are very common today. Especially stage Orange young males. They get trapped by this ideology because they have a deep lack of experience and understanding of political history and they want to assert their individualism come what may.

<p>
	Mindlessness is relative thing. People here are way more mindful, on average, than the general population or Trump voters.
</p>

<p>
	The important difference is that people here are interested in being more mindful. Trump supports are generally not.
</p>

<p>
	Being ignorant or mindless is not so bad. What's really bad is being aggressive and stubborn in one's ignorance and mindlessness. And Trump is promoting a culture of aggressive mindlessness & selfishness. People actually feel righteous about being so ignorant. This is a dangerous and pathological development which must be challenged.

<p>
	What you're overlooking is that without a bureaucracy there cannot be a highway at all.
</p>

<p>
	A highway is a very complex thing. It requires complex social structures to exist. You cannot just build a highway in the middle of the jungle and have it work. Highways only exist in advanced, complex, modern societies.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course! That's the whole point! Not privileged but you must develop through the lower stages by meeting and integrating various low level needs.
</p>

<p>
	The fruits of Blue & Orange are definitely necessary. The problem is that Blue & Orange are becoming pathological to the point where the whole planet is in danger.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with a desperate homeless person is precisely that he cannot take any higher level concerns seriously because he's so needy he can only care about himself. So the solution is help elevate as many such people as possible by helping them to meet their basic needs, so they stop being desperate. That desperation is making them unconscious and unable to consider larger ecological issues.
</p>

<p>
	Ecological concerns are not a privilege. If the planet's ecology crashes, millions of the poorest and more desperate people will die. It's already happening, you're just not aware of it because you haven't studied these issues seriously enough.
</p>

<p>
	Drop your ideological opposition and maybe you can learn something here and advance to a whole new level of understanding.

<p>
	I didn't say he was enlightened. I said God-like. God-like comes in many degrees and is relative to one's era and culture.

<p>
	Also don't conflate Spiral stages with enlightenment. Many Zen masters in Japan or yogis in India are enlightened but only at stage Blue of the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to be enlightened to be a good #2 leader. Bernie Sanders is a good example. He's far from enlightened but he is more God-like (i.e., selfless & compassionate) than most politicians of his time.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But that's the sick twisted irony of this whole situation. Trump is financially irresponsible so electing him reduces economic stability in the same way Bush crashed the economy with deregulation & tax cuts.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation hurt many of the poorest people.
</p>

<p>
	The people who vote for Trump are mindless precisely in the sense that they have an economic ideology which ends up shooting itself in the foot. They assume that unfettered capitalism will solve all problems (as their ideology promises them), but this just isn't the case because society and the economy are complex systems which work in counter-intuitive ways.
</p>

<p>
	People do not vote for Trump due to economics. They vote for him based on their gut feeling, because they resonate with his values and level of consciousness. Economics is a retroactive rationalization. The economy was improving and doing well under Obama. This is irrelevant to the Trump voter because economics is just an excuse. What drives them is their stage of cognitive and moral development. Don't let their retroactive rationalizations fool you. They themselves do not actually understand why they voted for Trump or are attracted to him. What they tell themselves are pleasant stories.
</p>

<p>
	It is very important to see through these stories and excuses.
</p>

<p>
	The poorest people actually voted more for Hilary than Trump. Trump's voters are in it for the culture war. Which is why Trump and Fox News are always playing up the culture war. Trump voters do not have a keen sense of policy. A vote for Trump is really a way for people who detest liberalism to spit in the eye of liberals. That's the whole emotional appeal of Trump. Trump is a "fuck you" to the "global elites". But of course the sick irony is that Trump is the fattest, greediest global elite there is because he loves money, sex, fame, power, and success no matter the cost.
</p>

<p>
	Poor people voting for a man who has a golden toilet in his house and lost $400 million dollars of daddy's money is the devil's sickest joke.

			The moment I read this, it finally clicked... I realized that real visionary leadership is leadership that inspires other people to think critically and more consciously. That’s what creates real collective change. Motivating individuals that empower them to take on greater concern than just their petty life...
		</p>

		<p>
			I think this just helped me clarify my life purpose. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To help you deepen that insight, there are basically two kinds of leadership:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Rally people towards selfishness using fear
	</li>
	<li>
		Rally people towards selflessness using love
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	It really is that simple. Of course there are many degrees of both. Most leadership is somewhere in the middle. Exceptional leadership is #2. And #2 is so rare precisely because is cannot be faked. The leader must lead by example by himself being selfless and loving, which is impossible for a big ego to do. Which is why human history is filled with examples of such terrible leaders. But also a few exceptional ones. Exceptional #2 leaders become deified as gods. Because they literally must be God-like to lead that way. Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, Muhammad, Gandhi, MLK, etc. Unconscious people are incapable of such leadership nor are they capable of electing such people into positions of power. Those who get elected tend to be the most ambitious, ruthless, and manipulative ones. Rarely a selfless person will get elected, but he will quickly be demonized and kicked out of power by the selfish people who feel threatened by his selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	The thing that selfish people hate the most is displays of selflessness. Because it makes them look bad.

<p>
	It's somewhat of a false dichotomy. In practice you must strike a delicate balance between both.

<p>
	Listening to podcasts is not a retreat.
</p>

<p>
	A retreat is a serious undertaking. Don't turn it into a mockery. Otherwise you're fooling yourself by telling yourself you did a retreat when you were really just driving in your car and listening to podcasts.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing wrong with driving or podcasts, but a solo retreat it is not.

</p>

<p>
	I did 13 trips over 13 consecutive days. By the end of it I was so deep mindfucked that fear of doing it became irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	It's normal to get a bit of anxiety prior to taking the substance. But once it's took, then just enjoy the ride.
</p>

<p>
	At certain levels of consciousness fear becomes untenable.

<p>
	Awakening is not a belief and cannot be embodied through any kind of actions or mental manipulations.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to understand awakening is to awaken. This requires a radical shift in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can help you quickly see how much you're missing.

<title>Asking girls before kissing them?</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13429-mada_/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13429" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13429-mada_/" rel="">@Mada_</a> There is no such need.
</p>

<p>
	All you need is to make direct eye contact and move your body/face within a foot of her's. If she doesn't hold eye contact or tries to lean away, she's not receptive. If she gives you puppy-dog eyes, then that's your green light.
</p>

<p>
	One final trick is to slowly brush her hair to the side with your fingers, and slowly run your fingers down her jaw line. If she flinches, she's not receptive and do not kiss her. If she maintains eye contact then she definitely wants to be kissed.
</p>

<p>
	Really, it's all about the eye contact. Look at her erotically in the eyes and hold it steady. If she maintains it, it's on boy!
</p>

<p>
	Another trick is if you go in for the kiss and she refuses it by leaning away. You brush it off as though nothing bad happened and try again 5-10 mins later. Keep trying even if she is resisting. Eventually she should relent.
</p>

<p>
	It's also important to time the moment. The mood has to be right. The best time to go for a kiss is after you've made her laugh. When she's in a good mood, she'll be much more receptive.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't make it a big deal. Don't make it some formal, stiff thing. The mood has to be light and casual so there is no nervousness or awkwardness about it.
</p>

<p>
	When you go for the kiss, decide on it and commit 100%. The worst thing you can do is be seconding-guessing yourself in your mind and half-assing it. Just assume that she wants it and that it will succeed. Don't be playing images of failure in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	If a girl is on a date with you, she's already agreed in her mind that she is willing to sleep with you. Otherwise she would have never agreed to the date in the first place. So all you gotta do is not be awkward or creepy.
</p>

<p>
	You need to build comfort and ease by doing lots of touching throughout the date. Then kissing is easy and natural. It is awkward and creepy when you go for half the date without a single touch. Get your hands around her body ASAP. You gotta be finding excuses to touch her all throughout the date. Tickle her and so forth in a playful way to break the ice.
</p>

<p>
	And finally, if you wanna use words, rather than asking, the better way is to declare it: "You look yummy. I feel like kissing you now." You must say it in a way where you are not fishing for her permission but stating your genuine desire and intention.
</p>

	Your understanding will be skin deep without books.
</p>

<p>
	Videos simply cannot deliver that much detail and nuance.

<p>
	Better than ever.

<p>
	There is less efforting and more of just being myself.

<p>
	I find that mechanical techniques actually just get in the way of being me.

<title>Is deep sleep the Absolute?</title>

<p>
	If something is Absolute, it is everything and everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	So the funny thing is, there is nothing but the Absolute. You can't escape it or avoid it. You are enmeshed in it at all times no matter what is happening.

<p>
	DPT probably has more potential for a bad trip for average people.
</p>

<p>
	Although I have not had a bad trip on it.

<p>
	I find mushrooms to be one of the most challenging substances. But still great!

<p>
	No, actual Truth is not a concept, thought, idea, or perspective. It is what is.
</p>

<p>
	Conceptual truths are partial and never complete. Conceptual truths are relative and subjective.

<p>

<p>
	No necessarily.
</p>

<p>
	First, access infinite intelligence, and then let's talk.

			Sort of like when you think you want 2 different things, e.g. you want to live both an expressive life and a passive life of meditation. One might think that those are conflicting interests only if they didn't see that they are complementary truths. One wouldn't make much sense without the other, and thus they can not just coexist, but they actually create a richness in what would otherwise be a rather bland experience (only appreciation would be rather colourless, and only expressivity wouldn't be very worthwhile).
		</p>

		<p>
			It just seems to me that there is always an integration possible that includes two seemingly contradictory goals, in a manner that doesn't exclude anything (making it not a compromise, but a win-win situation).
		</p>

		<p>
			Since reality is completely logical (meaning any statement can only be derived from a prior statements), doesn't that mean that complete falsehood is metaphysically impossible? I.e. regardless of how inclusive this statement is of other perspectives, it is still true relative to the goals of perspective that imagined them.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Your thinking is quite muddled here.
</p>

<p>
	Many of your assumptions are groundless. Awakening is not about integrating various human worldviews.

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

			As such, when you say that the goal of the devil to spread ignorance, I interpret that as that their goal is to raise confusion (muddying of the waters as you call it). Yet what I'm claiming is that for every attempt the devil makes to do this, it should be possible that to instead of fighting his claims through force (which is the very same process the devil uses right?), instead an integration with this truth is possible that creates a higher truth which is inclusive of both truths, making it impossible for anyone listening to fight this truth because there is no logical denying it possible. The ultimate extrapolation of this would be a truth so all-inclusive that it includes everything that can ever be said, every story that can ever happen, etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There are far too many deluded worldviews on this planet to take them all seriously. You have limited time and attention. If you take every fool on this planet seriously, you will never awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Cut the shit and go straight for awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Access the Absolute Truth. Access Infinite Intelligence. It's possible. I've done it. Many others have too. There's nothing to debate here. You either do the practices or you are just clowning around.
</p>

<p>
	That's what this entire thread is, clowning around.

	The Majority Report and The Michael Brooks Show on YouTube does a good job of talking about Brazillian politics.
</p>

<p>
	Michael Brooks has been a champion of freeing Lula.
</p>

<p>
	The Intercept is a top notch journalist outfit which covers the corruption in Brazil. Check out videos by Glen Greenwald.

</p>

<p>
	But honestly, it sounds to me like you're just making too big a deal out of it.
</p>

<p>
	A small to medium dose of 5-MeO should be fine.
</p>

<p>
	I find 5-MeO-DMT to be a very benign and straight-forward process. It's just like cranking up the consciousness dial in your head to 11. Relax and enjoy the pure consciousness. It might take a few trips to get comfortable with it.

If only it were so easy! Truth is much more tricky than that.
</p>

<p>
	If I were to compromise with a materialist devil, I would only debase myself. It's the devil's strategy to get you to compromise with him. He will kick and scream to get you to take him seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all that a devil has to do to win is muddly the waters. That's the game here. The devil cannot win in actuality because he is coming from falsehood. The devil wins by getting you distracted from Truth and Love.

<p>
	There is nothing but states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the only thing that exists.
</p>

<p>
	To criticize something as a state of consciousness is just silly, since things can't be anything else.
</p>

<p>
	All criticism occurs within a state of consciousness. If you deny what I'm saying, that too is a state of consciousness. So there's no escaping consciousness. State of consciousness dictates physical reality, biology, and everything else. Your biology is just a state of consciousness. If your heart is beating right now, that's a state of consciousness you are in. Change the state and your heart will disappear like it never existed.

<p>
	It's good for you guys to see both the incredible bullshit of religion, and the incredible value of religion. That's the twisted paradox of it.
</p>

<p>
	Try to hold both views in your mind at the same time. It's good for stretching the mind.

	There is value in what Ralston and Sadhguru both have to say.

	With love, empathy, and compassion.

<p>
	Confront reality as it is. A big part of reality is that it can be ruthless and tragic. That's what makes it feel "real".
</p>

<p>
	Embrace the tragedy of it. That's part of its stark beauty.

<p>

<p>
	The trick is that if the mind imagines that something has meaning, then it does.
</p>

<p>
	So the irony is, people who deeply imagine Jesus can actually materialize Jesus. Of course the problem is that they then fool themselves into thinking that that's the only way.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine that Sanskrit is valuable, then it becomes so.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine that Sanskrit is just some sounds, then it becomes so.
</p>

<p>
	The key is becoming conscious of how you're imagining all this. What are you giving meaning to?
</p>

<p>
	For example, Ralston gives meaning to martial arts. But is martial arts any less silly than going to a shrine? What is martial arts really? It's the silliest thing in the world if you think about it. Two monkeys fighting each other to be top monkey. Why?
</p>

<p>
	Then again, why do anything? So long as you're alive you gotta occupy your time somehow.

<p>
	Evil if what "you" -- an ego self -- has labeled stuff which threatens your existence as an ego self.
</p>

<p>
	Fortunately the ego-self is not real, so it cannot really be harmed. Harm is illusory. But it sure feels real from your POV. That's the power of ego. Ego imagines evil. This is the cost of being born. You can't be born without dying.

<p>
	You are confusing your ego self with God.
</p>

<p>
	God proper has no needs or lack.
</p>

<p>
	Any need or lack you feel is simply the human ego self striving to survive. As a human you have real needs to stay alive. So go ahead and satisfy some of them. Just don't get too lost in a never-ending quest of satisying survival needs as that is a road to hell.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you should go make some friends.
</p>

<p>
	But God proper is above such things.
</p>

<p>
	Turning inwards and facing loneliness is a good spiritual practice, but it's an advanced practice for people who are ready for such things. It's not a solution to socialization problems.

<p>
	It would be rather selfish to hoard all that love for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Think about this very simply in human terms: if you just won the lottery for infinite dollars, what would you do? You'd give it all away to your family and loved ones. Why? Because it's fucking infinite! You've got nothing you lose!
</p>

<p>
	How petty would you have to be to not share it?
</p>

<p>
	What is the point of being an all-powerful God if you cannot share your Beauty and Goodness with everyone?
</p>

<p>
	Can you think of anything better for God to do? What would you do if you were God? Seriously. Think about it. What would you do?
</p>

<p>
	In the end you will come to this one conclusion: there is nothing else for God to do but share its infinite love. There can be no higher purpose. Any other purpose would not be worthy of God.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, God has no needs. What would you do if you had absolutely no need or lack? You'd radiate Love!
</p>

</p>

<p>
	P.S. God IS bathing in Love for all of eternity. That bath is your experience. God loses nothing by creating you. You ARE God's Love!
</p>

<p>
	If you truly love yourself, why not touch yourself? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

	Because I recognize that all symbols are relative and arbitrary. They make sense within a given system. They have as much meaning as you give them.
</p>

<p>
	God invents and understands all symbols. And its understanding goes even deeper than anything symbols can depict.

	If you like my symbols, cool, but also don't take them too seriously, in the same way that you don't want to get too attached to a single language.

<p>
	No amount of psychedelics can help so long as the person maintains the context of "it's all just wacky stuff happening in the brain." That materialist anchor must be challenged until it is realized that the brain was merely a conceptual fabrication.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it takes radical openmindedness to even take such a possibility seriously. It just does not occur to most people that their brain could be a hallucination. Let alone all of material reality, let alone their birth as a self.
</p>

<p>
	This is radical work we're doing here folks. The mindfuck of it is epic beyond description. It is twisted as fuck.

<p>
	There are many options.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering mindfully is a very direct path towards awakening, but it's hard to do precisely because it involves the thing you hate most: lots of suffering!
</p>

<p>
	Or you could do some other spiritual practice like meditation, yoga, psychedelics, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The following videos might help you:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		How To Deal With Strong Negative Emotions
	</li>
	<li>
		Awareness Alone Is Curative
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Psychedelics are a great way to learn about suffering.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	But see, you don't like that. You want to transcend suffering but stay an ego. That cannot happen. You have to completely surrender until you realize you were never born. At which point you become immortal.
</p>

<p>
	You die by realizing you were never born. That thing you think you are -- it's imaginary. Like Santa Claus. This must be directly realized. This realization is what we call awakening/enlightenment around here. It's like realizing that Santa Claus never existed. The only difference is that instead of Santa Claus, it's YOU!
</p>

<p>
	You cannot end suffering without awakening.
</p>

<p>
	This was the Buddha's great teaching.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you'll need to go even deeper than awakening. You'll need to also study and become deeply conscious of how survival dominates your entire life.

	To survive as a self! Suffering is the resistance of the self to dissolution.
</p>

<p>
	If you didn't suffer, you'd literally die and become God.

<p>
	Suffering is survival.
</p>

<p>
	To stop suffering you'd have to transcend survival. But you don't know anything other than survival, so you're stuck.
</p>

<p>
	Even your desire to escape suffering is a form of survival, which of course just ends up creating more suffering.
</p>

<p>
	You are guys are not taking survival seriously enough as a topic. There is no more important topic to understand than survival.
</p>

<title>Reconciling Stage Green Productivity</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14265-clouffy/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14265" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14265-clouffy/" rel="">@clouffy</a> Green generally reduces the importance of productivity in favor of deepening relationships.
</p>

<p>
	This is not to say Green stops getting work done, but that macho desire to out-work all your competitors takes a back seat to building and enjoying relationships with human beings.
</p>

<p>
	So maybe rather than working overtime to publish 100 research papers, you devote more of your time to working one on one with your students and you become known as the most beloved professor by your students.
</p>

<p>
	Just an example.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, relationships can be powerful. Deep relationships can open many doors for you in life, so you may not have to work as hard.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, nothing wrong with work as long as it aligns with your values. Your work should be working towards embodying or spreading Green values. Then you'll be motivated. Instead of personal achievement and success, Green is more motivated to help people / environment.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I work a lot less than I used to when my center of gravity was Orange. Today I make a lot of time for chilling out, tripping, contemplation, and deepening my connection to God. This would be unthinkable to an Orange person. I still do work, but it happens more organically at a deeper level. There's less raw output, but more depth and enjoyment. I'm less neurotic about work. My sense of self is less identified with the quantity of work I do.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Hehe, that's a tough one. Academia is not generally open to that. Maybe you should reconsider being in academia. That's what I did. I have no desire to play their games.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, there certainly are ways to make it work.

</p>

<p>
	Of course Infinity includes both sentience and non-sentience, as that is a duality and a distinction which God imagines.
</p>

<p>
	God's plan is Love and Goodness. Awaken deeply to get the confirmation. Logic nor science will be sufficient. It is beyond communication or language.
</p>

<p>
	The confirmation of the most advanced things I teach is always: awakening. There cannot be any other way. You cannot use some dumb mechanical means to realize God's plan.

<p>
	You are God!
</p>

<p>
	Yes, prayer works, but you must be conscious that you are praying to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You also need to have a proper understanding of what "works" means in this context. Don't be praying for material stuff or the fulfillment of egoic needs. Pray for selflessness and unconditional love. Prayer for the end of your devilry.

<p>
	Of course you cannot just drop your POV. This takes decades of deconstructive work and numerous mystical experiences.

<p>
	In practice, less than 0.001% of the human population will ever discover the mind of God and cause of all Creation. Because they simply don't care enough to discover it.

<p>
	From your POV that cannot be understood.
</p>

<p>
	Drop your POV.
</p>

<p>
	Love = selflessness. How can you understand it if your entire worldview is built around surviving as a self?
</p>

<p>
	Darkness cannot understand light. A devil cannot understand God.

<p>
	Horrible is a judgment you're making. Horror is a projection of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	All acts that happen in the universe happen out of Love. But you cannot see it because you are being too selfish.

<p>
	Amazingly numerical infinities have various sizes.
</p>

<p>
	Watch the video, Understanding Absolute Infinity - Part 2, where the work of Georg Cantor is explained.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity is not the same as a numerical infinity. Absolute Infinity doesn't have a size. It is simply reality itself.

<p>
	The universe is not indifferent.
</p>

<p>
	But also the universe has much bigger plans than merely keeping every being physically safe.
</p>

<p>
	The universe prioritzes freedom above physical safety.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're not understanding it is because you're trying to understand the selfless mind of God using your selfish mind. That cannot work. Your view of death and suffering is biased by the ego's hatred and fear of both. God doesn't hate, so this is not part of God's ultimate design.
</p>

<p>
	To understand God you must stop hating and fearing things.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There are stages to moral, cognitive, and spiritual development. These stages are consistent across people around the world.
</p>

<p>
	Absolutistic worldviews are lower than relativistic ones. With development, an absolutistic person will evolve into a relativistic one, but not vice versa. No amount to growth will turn a relativistic person into an absolutist, or a systems thinker into a black and white thinker.
</p>

<p>
	These are not just my opinions. This is scientific research from within developmental psychology. Study it, if you care to understand.

The conservative value set is lower consciousness. A conservative's sense of self is denser and fear greater. A conservative's cognitive and moral development are objectively lower and less truthful.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with false equivalencies and splitting all issues down the middle.
</p>

<p>
	The mid point between slavery and anti-slavery is still backwards.
</p>

<p>
	None of this makes liberals immune to ignorance or self-deception. But relative to conservatives they are 1 stage higher.
</p>

<p>
	Note: remember, these are relative evaluations, not absolute. Spiral Dynamics is a relative model. But politics is a relative matter so it fits.

<p>
	I notice you guys still have not penetrated (excuse the pun) the issue of survival as talked about in my 2 part survival series.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like using sex for pleasure is still survival! Survival is not just about making babies. Survival is about maintaining your self. The desire for intimacy, romance, and companionship is all survival.
</p>

<p>
	If a thing in life has any importance to you, you can be sure it's tied to your survival in some elaborate way.
</p>

<p>
	If a thing was irrelevant to your survival, you would not be talking about it, much less having a strong opinion about it.
</p>

<p>
	Opinions and emotions are survival.

<p>
	Realize this: one vs many it itself a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is one. Reality is many. It's both. There is no difference between the two. And there is a difference between the two. Depending on your POV.
</p>

<p>
	Is a dozen eggs one, or many?
</p>

<p>
	Notice the role of relativity in these kinds of questions.

<p>
	I am not stating my views. I am explaining how the culture holds sexuality.
</p>

<p>
	Of course my explanation is stage Blue/Orange because that's what our culture mostly is.
</p>

<p>
	If you wish to transcend this Blue/Orange stage we first need to be honest about it and understand it. Many people want to jump to stage Green love without fully understanding that sex & "love" are survival strategies. And then of course these same Green people end up having terrible relationships and much sex which ends in misery. That's because they fooled themselves into calling their selfish survival strategies "love".
</p>

<p>
	"love" is very tricky. The devil co-opts love so easily.

<p>
	It's not a matter of degrading or not. This is just how the sexual marketplace works for most humans. This is culture and survival.
</p>

<p>
	It does not have to be this way in the future. But today this is the cultural reality.
</p>

<p>
	When we talk about culture we are talking about averages and trends, so individual exceptions are expected. Just because you might not care about the cultural norms and values does not mean they don't exist.
</p>

<p>
	Most women want to settle down with a man who will be loyal to her. To deny this is silly. This desire to settle down with a man is a survival strategy.
