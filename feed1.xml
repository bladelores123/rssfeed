<title>Spiral Dynamics is false</title>

<p>
	This is a general warning to all keyboard-jockeys here who like to spout off uneducated and contrarian opinions. This forum is a not a place for venting your ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	People who keep repeatedly spreading false information will get warnings and eventual bans.
</p>

<p>
	This is not CNN, where you get to say anything you like and get away with it as though "both sides are equally right".
</p>

<p>
	This post shows zero evidence that you have actually read or studied Spiral Dynamics. It's as though you are denying the theory of evolution without having bothered to study any of the scientific literature on the model.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to present an intelligent critique of Spiral Dynamics, that's fine. But first show us that you've actually bothered to study it. Spiral Dynamics is a very nuanced model that requires dozens of hours of careful study to understand. Tell us which books you've read on the subject. Tell us which courses you've taken. Show us you've understood the model first, rather than advancing an ideologically-based rejection.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't want to study Spiral Dynamics, that's perfectly fine. But then keep your opinions about it to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	"Better" is a relative notion.
</p>

<p>
	In the Absolute sense nothing is better than anything else.
</p>

<p>
	In the relative sense, it's better to live in a Green society than a Blue society for most people.
</p>

<p>
	Higher stages are less blindly selfish and egotistical than lower stage. Which generally makes for a "better" life. You would much rather live in Alabama than in the Congo.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to be a bloodthirsty psychopath, by all means, go ahead. See how that works out for you and your people.

			Can you explain how Zen monasticism is blue? I thought most of the western folks ending up there would have seen through materialism and be looking for something deeper in their lives. I guess I'm thinking of people that have become dissolutioned with their materialistic orange based societies and seeing that consumerism doesn't make them happy. Are they not training have love and acceptance of all, and being more tolerant of all others, and ultimately progress up the spiral??

<p>
	It tends to be very traditional and conservative.
</p>

<p>
	Of course not always. But you have to see Zen as more than just enlightenment. Zen is an entire tradition, like Hinduism is.
</p>

<p>
	Even though Zen and Hinduism can lead you to enlightenment, they are usually dogmatic and Blue in their value structure.

			Hey <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="1" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/" rel="">@Leo Gura</a>, I have a question on this one. I see how the Marathon Monks of Mount Hiei can be very disciplined in a dogmatic fashion. They do things because the scriptures say so, and they'd rather die than disobey and break their honor, but, don't you think that by a total surrender of your life to something, as those Monks do, they maybe do get enlightened?
		</p>

		<p>
			I know enlightenment isn't something directly implied by the spiral dynamics, but imagine they are deeply blue, and suddenly they realize the true nature of reality and that allows them to have a massive holistic view and understanding of everything, as the higher stages do. So maybe those monks are either very blue and become very turquoise from a moment to the next one...
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't doubt their enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	You can be enlightened but your value system can still be very traditional and conservative.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment alone is not enough to take you to Turquoise. Enlightenment will not magically transform your value system to Yellow or Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not directly tracking one's progress towards enlightenment. That is not what the model was designed for.

	The 9/11 hijackers were also Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Which Blue Americans find very offensive when that's pointed out to them because it's too much truth for Blue to admit.
</p>

<p>
	Blue has to deny the atrocities of Blue in order to stay Blue. Blue has a good set of justifications for distinguishing itself from other forms of Blue which are obviously unhealthy.

<p>
	Hacksaw Ridge is probably the most positive depiction of stage Blue you're gonna find:
</p>

<p>
	Not surprising, given Mel Gibson is a stage Blue kinda guy, so he glorifies Blue.

<p>
	Well... it's a broad generalization. I can't know for sure. But Blue is the type of person who would die in the call of duty for his country/people.
</p>

<p>
	Reminds of the movie Ladder 49, which was a stage Blue tearjerker:

<p>
	Conciousness/reality is not a metaphore. It is itself.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot access Truth via metaphore. So you're gonna have to let it go eventually if you want to awaken.

Rather than speculating, sit down and contemplate: What is a thought? Where does it come from? Where does it go?
</p>

<p>
	The answers are all there in your direct experience. Asking us about it will not help you. It's distraction from the work you should be doing.
</p>

<p>
	The topic of thoughts or consciousness is not a theoretical one. Thoughts are happening in real-time for you right now! So look at them to see what they are. Don't think about thoughts. Observe thoughts happening.

Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit.

			Does this really have any practical implications?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The practical implications are so enormous you cannot even being to fathom them, and they cannot be easily explained to a materialist such as yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Reality does not exist!
</p>

<p>
	You were never born!
</p>

<p>
	You invented every single problem in your life!
</p>

<p>
	Do you realize how significant that is?
</p>

<p>
	It seems like abstraction to you because all you're doing is holding idealism as an idea in your mind, while holding materialism as REALITY. But what you fail to see is that to truly realize idealism means that your entire notion of reality will crumble. You're not interested in having that happen, so you merely entertain idealism as an idea. And of course, an idea of enlightenment is a pure abstraction with no practice consequences for your life.
</p>

<p>
	It is as though you are a poor man on the street complaining: "But Leo! How is the idea of being a billionaire going to change my life? It's pure abstraction! How is that going to feed me? Ideas don't pay bills."
</p>

<p>
	You're right! The idea of being a billionaire will not feed you.
</p>

<p>
	But I am not talking about an idea of being a billionaire. I am talking about a cold hard billion dollars in your pocket. Not the idea of it, but the actual thing.
</p>

<p>
	Take some LSD and see for yourself what you're missing.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a very simple practical implication:
</p>

<p>
	An idealist is immortal and cannot die. A materialist will die.
</p>

<p>
	And there are thousands more practical consequences of idealism. Like the ability to heal yourself of serious physical diseases using your mind. Which a materialist cannot do.
</p>

<p>
	I have studied Hitler. He was the epitome of Blue. He was also zonked out of his mind on meth and other narcotics.

<p>
	If you give someone like Alex Jones absolute power, he becomes a Hitler-like character.

<p>
	No, I never said that.
</p>

<p>
	I knew since my teenage years that my worldview is not absolutely true.
</p>

<p>
	I explained this long ago in my epistemology episodes.
</p>

<p>
	When I speak of Absolute Infinity, don't confuse that with a worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing I have ever said is the Truth. Nor will it ever be. You guys still don't get that.
</p>

<p>
	Since the first Actualized video 5 years ago, I have never been under the impression that what I say is Truth. It only seems that way from your perspective. I make a clear distinction in my mind between concept and reality. Most of you guys don't, so you project that paradigm onto my speech and teachings, which is understandable, but it gives you an inaccurate sense of my worldview.
</p>

<p>
	My worldview is that all worldviews are false, including my worldview. This has been my worldview since I was about 18.

<p>
	Definitely
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind uses science to back up whatever worldview it has, and rejects science in those areas where it contradicts the worldview.
</p>

<p>
	The name of the game is very simple: defend my worldview come what may, at any cost, because my worldview is absolutely true.
</p>

<p>
	The delicious irony is that science uses science & reason in exactly the same manner, creating a circular justification for itself.

<p>
	That's because your personal lack of development clouds your vision. You cannot understand Yellow until you're at Yellow yourself.
</p>

<p>
	As you become more conscious, you will understand that a stage Yellow person would never behave the way Trump does.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is nowhere close to Yellow. Not even a little bit. Trump actively hates Yellow. He's the opposite of Yellow.

	Trump has actually fractured the Blue/Orange Republican party. The more evolved and moderate Blues are forced to denounce Trump's Redish qualities.

	He's a toxic mix of Blue/Orange and probably has some legit mental issues.
</p>

<p>
	It's very easy to believe your own bullshit when you start making millions of dollars every month selling your ideology as he does. At stage Orange, there is nothing beyond success and money, so when ideology becomes profitable, it's a killer combination from which Blue/Orange cannot escape. Money appears like the perfect validation of God's truth, creating a closed feedback loop of bullshit which feels very real to the person inside it.

<title>Spiral Dynamics. The 1968 Movement and Capitalists</title>

<p>
	A) Many true hippies from that era remain hippies to this day, and are really into self-actualization and spirituality. Most modern self-help is thanks to the human potential movement of the 60's. Many of today's enlightened teachers were hippies in the 60's. Like Shinzen Young.
</p>

<p>
	B) There was a strong, deliberate crackdown on stage Green by stages Blue and Orange. Capitalism outlawed psychedelics and shut down the counter-culture movement. Because it was a deep threat to capitalism. If the US government did not crack down on the counter-culture revolution and outlaw psychedelics, our culture would be much more evolved today.
</p>

<p>
	C) May of the people partaking of the counter-culture movement were just dabblers. Going to a few music festivals does not mean you're at stage Green in your heart.
</p>

<p>
	Most people today don't recognize how much of an impact the 60's revolution had on modern culture. Its effects can still be felt to this day.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I lived in Texas for 5 years. Texas is a pretty diverse place. Sure, you got some cowboys, but the big cities like Dallas are not Blue. Very livable.
</p>

<p>
	And Austin is like San Francisco Green, with a yoga studio on every corner.
</p>

<p>
	Move to Austin and enjoy all the hippies you can stomach.
</p>

<p>
	I might move to Austin next year myself. Great town.

<p>
	Pope Francis is another pretty good example of Blue. Although he too has some percentage of Green which gives him compassion and the value of equality.
</p>

<p>
	Blue + Green make for a very nice combo. Green tempers out Blue's harsh moralizing and us-vs-them thinking.

<p>
	Here's a what a very healthy version of Blue might look like. Of course Comey isn't pure Blue. He's got Orange and Green too. But his entire book and way of talking and carrying himself is a list of Blue keywords.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that Blue can be very stable and reliable. A good judge or executor of the law. A good defender of decency and ethical standards.
</p>

<p>
	Solid, like a rock.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of blue collar workers: firefighters, good police people, good FBI officers, decent military folks, tax collectors, post office employees, hard working coal miners, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The 9/11 firefighters mights be one of the most positive examples.
</p>

<p>
	John McCain displays some positive aspects of Blue.
</p>

<p>
	James Comey and Robert Mueller display some positive aspects of Blue.
</p>

<p>
	At its best Blue can be very honest, decent, loyal, hard working, reserved, stable, dispassionate, incorruptable.

	Did George W Bush feel bad about invading Iraq? Nope. He was doing God's work. The death of 100,000+ Iraqis is a small price to pay for protecting the kingdom of God.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Green's top value is equality, civil rights, and breaking down hierarchies. So slavery seems antithetical to that.
</p>

<p>
	Green is very critical of the wage slavery of capitalism. Although real slavery is much much less conscious than the "slavery" of capitalism. To call capitalism "slavery" does a disservice real slaves.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine someone like Bernie Sanders. He's not going to enslave anyone, even if he's given absolute power. But he will tax the rich to level the playing field. Which is why Blue & Orange hates him.
</p>

<p>
	It's a function of consciousness. If collective consciousness is high enough, it will not happen.
</p>

<p>
	There is too much stage Green in America to allow for that. So unless you kill off all those Green people, it won't happen. Green would riot in the streets. We are already seeing a huge backlash from Green against Trumpism, and Trump hasn't done anything even close to that.
</p>

<p>
	Even the most conservative Republicans do not want slavery back. Because they are too evolved for that. But 200 years ago, it could have happened. That's how much collective consciousness has grown.

<p>
	Hey, ya'll, I need your help!
</p>

<p>
	I want to create a comprehensive list of video examples of prototypical stage Blue thinking.
</p>

<p>
	This is not meant to humiliate or demonize stage Blue. It's meant to be an educational tool for people learning about Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	So towards that end, scour Youtube and find all the videos you can which exhibit stage Blue thinking. Try to find videos which are short and sweet. Conservative talk show hosts offer tons of Blue material, but also try to find other unique examples. The more diversity we can display here, the better. Try to find examples from various cultures: Europe, Middle East, Asia, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, Africa, South America, etc.
</p>

<p>
	We will create a mega-thread like this for every stage in the Spiral, from Red to Turquoise. But for now, let's just focus on Blue. Each week I will start a new mega-thread topic for the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Do not start a political debate in this thread!</strong> It is not our goal here to defend our personal political positions or to judge any stage, but simply to compile examples.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for your help! I'm excited to see what kind of juicy stuff you dig up. Try to be selective with your choices.
</p>

<p>
	This can turn into a really cool list.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue values:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Absolute truth cannot be questioned
	</li>
	<li>
		Only one right way to live
	</li>
	<li>
		Belief, faith, certainty
	</li>
	<li>
		Objective right & wrong
	</li>
	<li>
		Good & evil exist
	</li>
	<li>
		The devil is real
	</li>
	<li>
		Hard work, discipline, duty
	</li>
	<li>
		Law & order
	</li>
	<li>
		Justice, stability, security
	</li>
	<li>
		Sinners deserve punishment & no compassion
	</li>
	<li>
		Hierarchy, social order, status quo
	</li>
	<li>
		Patriarchy, women serve men
	</li>
	<li>
		Meaning & greater purpose
	</li>
	<li>
		Morality
	</li>
	<li>
		Defending one's culture
	</li>
	<li>
		Culture, tradition, heritage
	</li>
	<li>
		Crusading for a righteous cause
	</li>
	<li>
		Serving God
	</li>
	<li>
		Theology
	</li>
	<li>
		Root out the heretics & traitors
	</li>
	<li>
		Doctrine, ideology
	</li>
	<li>
		Orthodoxy, dogma, conformity
	</li>
	<li>
		Family, family values
	</li>
	<li>
		Obedience, reverence
	</li>
	<li>
		Respect for elders
	</li>
	<li>
		God & country
	</li>
	<li>
		Patriotism
	</li>
	<li>
		Righteous living
	</li>
	<li>
		Honor, principles, moral codes of conduct
	</li>
	<li>
		Good manners, decency, etiquette
	</li>
	<li>
		Finds profanity offensive, blasphemy
	</li>
	<li>
		Dress & hair regulations
	</li>
	<li>
		Prayer
	</li>
	<li>
		Pride in one’s civilization: we are the best
	</li>
	<li>
		Canonical texts cannot be questioned: Bible, Quran, Torah, Gita, Constitution, Upanishads, Vedas, Buddha
	</li>
	<li>
		Holy book is the literal word of God
	</li>
	<li>

<p>
	I understand the idea. There is nothing to improve from the Absolute perspective. You're already perfect.
</p>

<p>
	But this is not mutually exclusive with personal development. You can and should do both. You don't need to be "flawed" in order to grow, learn, and evolve your lifestyle and modes of behavior.
</p>

<p>
	You can be a perfect human being, and still not know how to play the piano, and then decide to learn to play master piano. Wanting to learn to play master piano is not egotism, unless you make it such.

<p>
	I guess they can be Red at super extremes, but I'm talking about mainstream feminism.
</p>

<p>
	Just like I would not classify PUA as Red but Orange, I would classify feminism as Green. Because feminism seeks the values of Green for the most part. I don't think your average feminist wants women to dominate men. She wants equality.
</p>

<p>
	And your average PUA wants to bang a bunch of hot girls (which is pure Orange).

</p>

<p>
	An example of Red PUA would be a PUA who actually rapes or beats a woman. This isn't simply manipulative behavior, it's thuggish criminal behavior, which is Red. And I have met such PUAs. But most PUAs are not that low. They are mostly Orange. They will manipulate and lie, but within limits.
</p>

<p>
	The reason Julien got into hot water is because he was glorifying borderline Red behavior. And people rightly got outraged. Abusing and humiliating women is counter-productive to PUA, not to mention deeply unconscious, and terrible PR.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are a lot of positives to Blue (especially relative to Red). I focused on negatives in the video because the point of talking about the stages is to help people see the limitations of each stage, so they can be motivated to transcend.
</p>

<p>
	If I had to choose between living in a Red or Blue society, I would choose Blue.
</p>

<p>
	I agree, the Medieval church was not as backwards as many people today believe. The Medieval church was trying to spread enlightenment, in a twisted way.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org is basically just a modern version of the Medieval church.

They are not good or bad. Green is not supposed to be "good" or "evolved" or "better than" or immune to excess.
</p>

<p>
	Feminism is Green, AND there are healthy and unhealthy ways in which Green manifests. An unhealthy manifestation of Green does not knock it down to Orange or Red. It's just excessive Green.
</p>

<p>
	Men who are stuck in Orange have a really hard time understanding feminism. Too much judgment clouds their vision. Feminism is simply the desire of women to break down the traditional alpha-male value dominate hierarchy and gain parity with males. Women want to be heard after centuries of being ignored and shut up. Sometimes they take it too far.
</p>

<p>
	Without feminism, you get stuff like Saudi Arabia not letting women drive cars or open bank accounts. So feminism is very necessary for building a more fair society. And if you were a repressed woman, you'd likely resonate with feminism.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine your daughter not being able to vote or drive a car simply because your tradition forbids it. Not very nice. Imagine your daughter getting raped, but then her testimony in court against the rapist doesn't count, because she is a woman, and a man's testimony carries 5x more weight by law, so the rapist goes free. Would you be cool with that? How would that make you feel if you were the woman who got raped?
</p>

<p>
	Maybe that would make you a feminist?
</p>

<title>The Clare Graves Model is the Most Manipulative Thing I've Ever Heard Of</title>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/11494-sea/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="11494" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/11494-sea/" rel="">@Sea</a> A stage Yellow person is never going to revert back to stage Blue. It's sort of like leaving a cult. Once you are conscious enough, re-joining a cult cannot work on you. For example, there is no way that Albert Einstein or Barrack Obama could become an ISIS Jihadist (unless maybe his brain is damaged). It would never happen because he's too conscious for that.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to see a stage Orange society revert back to stage Red. America is never going to become a theocracy like Saudi Arabia, for example.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Temporary regression is possible in the sense that one may still not be stabilized at one's level. For example, America leaned Green with electing Obama, and then regressed back down to Blue/Orange with electing Trump. But this was not a change in America's level of development, it was just a difference of expression. America is evolving up the Spiral. America is not going to be Blue in 100 years as much as it will be Green. So to say that there is no directionality would be very misleading. There will never be a time when slavery and Jim Crow laws get re-instated. That ship has long sailed for Americans.
</p>

<p>
	When you are angry/fearful, you will express lower stages than when you are joyful and confident. So there's that additional wrinkle. For example, if America experiences a new great depression, or a nuclear attack, then the population will be angry and fearful, so they will skew more conservative, more Blue, more authoritarian.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, Clare Graves' understanding of Spiral Dynamics was itself limited because he was not a nondual mystic. He didn't really understand the connection between Spiral Dynamics and Consciousness. My explanations of Spiral Dynamics are not just a parroting of someone else's theory, but my understanding of it, which is informed by my nondual experiences.
</p>

<p>
	And very importantly, being at higher levels is not "good" or "better". Turquoise is no "better" than Red. At the highest levels of nonduality you will have unconditional acceptance for all stages, all "evils", all ignorance. You, as God, are EVERYTHING, with no better than, worse than, or lesser. A human is not better than an ape or a dinosaur or a pig.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Spiral Dynamics can easily be abused, like any model. As far as models go, Spiral Dynamics is a very complex and nuanced one, with lots of subtlety, which can easily be misapplied unless you study it very closely. There is a tendency to oversimplify Spiral Dynamics. To apply Spiral Dynamics properly you need to be a solid stage Yellow. Lower stages will tend to misapply it.
</p>

<p>
	Is Spiral Dynamics limited? Of course.
</p>

<p>
	Is Spiral Dynamics the Absolute Truth? Of course not.
</p>

<p>
	Is Spiral Dynamics helpful for growing yourself and your society? Very much so, if you apply it carefully.
</p>

<p>
	Can Spiral Dynamics be abused to justify all sorts of judgments and evils? Of course.
</p>

For example, the ancient greeks were very accepting of homosexuality and other practices that were considered very taboo by other civilizations. Even the romans were accepting of this behavior. However, when these empires collapse it seems like life when backwards and all progress just stopped. Have lower stage civilizations taken over higher stages in the past?

<p>
	It's a tricky topic. It's hard to judge from our vantage point who was more advanced, Rome/Greece vs the Christian empire. The Middle Ages were not as dark as is popularly assumed.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, up to 45% of the Roman population were slaves. It's difficult for us to imagine just how barbaric and cruel life was in these ancient civilizations. Sure, homosexuality might have been accepted, but you could also be thrown into a pit of lions for some random reason, or your wife raped on the side of a bridge crossing.
</p>

<p>
	If a Roman city was sacked, all the men were slaughtered and all the women and children sold into slavery.
</p>

<p>
	Christianity did bring about a certain degree of moral order.

</p>

<p>
	At the deepest levels of nonduality all action is pointless. You could just shoot yourself and it would be okay. It's all perfect. Teaching is pointless of course. But in practice you will probably just carry on with life, for shits and giggles, and probably teach.
</p>

<p>
	The world cannot be improved in any way at all. It is an Absolute singularity, and everything is already contained within it for eternity. But this is not something that can be explained, and it certainly sits outside of Spiral Dynamics so I don't even talk about it. You will only discover this for yourself, at the very deepest levels of nondual consciousness. At which point, you will no longer need me or anyone else to guide you.

You cannot get to unconditional acceptance through intellectualization or belief. You need to start having some nondual experiences, mystical experiences. Psychedelics or yoga/meditation is the way.
</p>

<p>
	But practicing active non-judgment is also very helpful.

<title>Is Stage Green A Weird One for Men (Spiral Dynamics)?</title>

<p>
	Yes, this is actually a big obstacle for men, because most men are so preoccupied with appearing alpha.
</p>

<p>
	From all the criticism, judgment, and resistance that I see about Green, it feels like 50% of it is coming from males who have not sufficiently embodied their manhood, so they are insecure, and try to act macho, thereby demonizing Green.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I said about stage Blue: embrace your feminine side. This will also apply to stage Orange males. The power of embracing your feminine side is enormous.
</p>

<p>
	To a juvenile man or "bro", Green will feel soft and weak.
</p>

<p>
	I once recommended a Matt Kahn video to a PUA coaching client of mine who was stuck in stage Orange. It was a really important video about love. He refused to listen to the advice because Matt Kahn came off as "too soft and feminine".
</p>

<p>
	The striving to be alpha and macho is really toxic.
</p>

<p>
	I was basically unable to coach him out of his issues because he was so insistent on acting out Orange to the max. He just couldn't fathom the value of Green. And yet, all of the answers to his problems lay in Green and beyond.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with Orange is that it's extremely shallow. There is no satisfaction to be found there.
</p>

The Greeks were famously open to homosexuality and pedophilia.
</p>

<p>
	I meant it's a new evolutionary wrinkle in modern culture. The last 50 years have seen a huge change in public perception of homosexuality. A really big shift occurred even just since the 90's. Even many Republicans these days are starting to accept homosexuality, which would have been shocking 50 years ago. Our culture is changing rapidly. Which is why stage Blue feels under attack by progressives like Obama and Hillary.

That's a secular battle.
</p>

<p>
	Absolutism doesn't have to be about God and religion, but it usually is.
</p>

<p>
	Stubbornness and closedmindedness is not exclusive to Blue. It tends to manifest all along the Spiral in various forms.
</p>

<p>
	Green people can be fairly ideological about equality and civil rights issues. For example, Green Peace or PETA. That doesn't make them Blue. They are solid Green. Green, like any stage, can get dysfunctional at its extremes.
</p>

<p>
	The key difference between Blue and Green is that Green is against rigid hierarchies and focused on equality, building human bonds, sharing feelings. Blue is focused more on law and order and tradition.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You can technically have mystical experiences at stage Blue. But these days, if you're going to become enlightened, you're probably gonna be at stage Turquoise, especially if you follow sources like Actualized.org or other modern nonduality teachers. Because we all teach inclusiveness and holistic thinking in a non-sectarian way.
</p>

<p>
	In that past, when people became enlightened they would mostly do it within a single insulated tradition, like Christianity or Hinduism, or Zen. Nowadays you can hardly stay insulated from all the various traditions. Nonduality has become a melting pot.
</p>

<p>
	Deep nondual experiences will tend to push your values and worldview towards Turquoise quite naturally.
</p>
