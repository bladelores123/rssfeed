			I follow and practice spirituality for years (no mystical experiences yet sadly), and really the only question that never gets resolved is how can we differentiate enlightenment/absolute truth from psychotic states?
		</p>

		<p>
			The only answer ive gotten from <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="1" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/" rel="">@Leo Gura</a> is "You just know absolute truth when it happens to you" but I cant do anything with that. I have exactly the same amount of evidence for materialism as I have for idealism, extactly zero. I dont believe in anything and how can I ever ? You can always be in states of pure delusion.
		</p>

		<p>
			Wether the brain exists or not - thats another question - but I'm 100% sure within this reality you can make some very specific cuts with a scalpel on a brain and that person will wake up thinking he is enlightened, met god, and will talk like the buddha. So you can not be sure of anybody - not big news - but how can you ever be sure that you yourself are not this person?

<p>
	Psychotic states are no different really than "normal" states. Consciousness can take on an infinite number of states. All states are part of the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to access the Absolute is through direct self-realization. It is not even a process. There is no method. Either you are conscious of yourself as God or you are not.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is not a belief. It's happening right now.
</p>

<p>
	The point is not to enter some one true state. The point is to go meta and instantly realize the nature of all possible states, penetrating through them all.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is thinking of awakening as some kind of special state or position, when it is the transcendence of all states and positions. Once you transcend everything, there can no longer be a question about delusion or psychosis or "Is this real?" or "But how can I be sure?" or "But what if I'm wrong?"
</p>

<p>
	No! All of that junk is transcended. Not in theory but actually.
</p>

<p>
	It is in fact insane to believe there is a difference between reality and psychosis.
</p>

<p>
	You lack nuance, conflating absolute and relative domains.
</p>

<p>
	Just because there is an Ultimate Mystery doesn't mean we can't explain why there's shit in the toilet, and fix it.
</p>

<p>
	Your absolutist logic can be used to say, "Well, who really knows how the shit got there? It's all a grand mystery."
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe you just forgot to flush and are making up colorful spiritual stories to cover your ass.

<p>
	You have to take into account, though, that if all those 1000s of people didn't go on that cruise, they would be polluting individually back at home. Don't forget to take into account how much 1000 people shit, piss, eat, buy, throw away, etc. in one week back at home. Don't forget to factor in the cost of gas, oil, sewage, and water back at home.
</p>

<p>
	Just to stay alive requires pollution. How much do 1000 birds shit in one week?
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying cruise ships aren't wasteful, but context is important. Of course 1000s of people gathered in a small space will create lots of pollution.

<p>
	You don't need to have a child to understand how love feels and works.
</p>

<p>
	There is no fundamental difference between loving a child, loving a dog, and loving a car.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously a mother's love is self-biased because the mother chooses to love "my child" rather than a million other children on the planet. That why I call it selfish. But it's still love. Love is love. We're just talking about degrees of limitation.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you could also say that a mother's love is selfless in that she would be willing to sacrifice herself for her child.
</p>

<p>
	But the same was true of Hitler. Hitler's love was also selfless in this sense because he was willing to sacrifice himself for his love of his country and his race. But as you can see, that was a very limited form of love.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, much higher levels of love are possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's life. That's a tricky balancing act.
</p>

<p>
	You are God in human form, so you both seek the infinite and the finite and you're torn between the two. You are divided. You seek unity but you don't know how to get there so you grasp around in the dark and you are addicted to division, so every time you grasp you make another division, thinking it will bring you to unity.

			For example from a woman's/mother's point of view, how much of her love for her partner and children is survival and how much of it transcends that. Does she logically have to know there's a difference to transcend it? Or does love transcend it in itself. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Is love itself the structure? Can love not also be the content? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	These are tricky issues which are rooted in complex and profound existential dynamics that few people have any awareness of, and such understanding is not part of our shared culture.
</p>

<p>
	In the end everything is an unfolding of Love. But limited beings like humans get attached to limited forms of love and their capacity to love is very limited because they are preoccupied with survival and they are too unconscious and too selfish to love in the highest ways possible.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is just a limited manifestation of love. To kill another person to maintain one's survival is love for life. But it's a narrow, limited kind of love. Surrendering one's need/desire to kill another person would be a higher form of love.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness is love! But a limited form of it. Selflessness is an unlimited form of it.
</p>

<p>
	A mother of course loves her children out of selfishness, self-bias, and survival, but this is still genuine love. It's just very limited.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem with limited and selfish forms of love is that they become an obstacle to much greater, unlimited forms of love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is all there is. It is the highest structure of all reality. At the level of the Absolute, structure and content become identical.
</p>

<p>
	We are Infinite Love. The trick is being able to live in alignment with that.
</p>

<p>
	Well... I would just encourage you to contemplate What is evil? It's a deep question -- if you're interested. Try to avoid speculation and focus on observing what it is.

</p>

<p>
	Although, notice, "I want to improve my life" is itself a high-level structure which runs the whole show of how you go about doing this.
</p>

<p>
	It might turn out that the structure "I want to improve my life" itself needs to be questioned and gone meta on. Maybe striving to improve my life is a big part of the problem here? Maybe the very notion of "my life" is the problem?

			But the problem is that people can write me that "Language is enough and we dont need meditation and self inquiry because there are psychologists and with them you can go deep enough to core issues. So our culture right now is good enough! So you dont have to go beyond language at all."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is a very deep ignorance to correct in someone. A person who believes that there is no value in existential investigation is hard to convince that it has value. It requires serious inquiry to start to appreciate the limitations of things like language, science, psychology, culture, etc. Only very seriously openminded and curious people will go down that rabbit hole.
</p>

<p>
	Entire books could be written (and have been written) about the limitations of science, language, and psychology. It requires a lot of reading, research, and personal contemplation to start to see a big enough picture, then the limitations become glaring. Until then it will appear like there are no problems.
</p>

<p>
	In practice maybe just skirt around the issue. Rather than trying to convince people that science or language is limited, just teach them whatever helpful thing you want to teach them which is beyond those limits. If you teach people helpful techniques they won't really care if it's "scientific" or not. People are suckers for effective, practical techniques that can help improve their life.

</p>

<p>
	How are you using her for your survival? How is she using you for her survival? What is the "you" that is being survived? What is her "you" that is being survived?
</p>

<p>
	Manipulation is another sub-structure that will be important to understand in the context of relationships. Notice how you too manipulate each other constantly to meet each others needs. This manipulation creates a dysfunctional dynamic. Successful relationship requires becomes conscious of your manipulations and letting them go. That's a lot of work since you manipulate so much and you do it so seamlessly and habitually.

	You don't know that. You haven't even bothered to contemplate or observe what desire is. Maybe if you looked at it, you'd find out. After all, there it is -- in you. If you can't understand it, who can? After all, we're not talking about understanding moon rocks or kangaroos, we're talking about the desires you feel and act out every day.

<p>
	If someone says that to you, run away while you can.

<p>
	Such reassurances don't need to be made in healthy relationships.
</p>

<p>
	Your descriptions of him are getting more and more toxic and dysfunctional. There is no way this will work, so don't feel bad, you're not really surrendering anything workable by leaving. You are simply accepting that this is unworkable.
</p>

<p>
	You will save yourself years of suffering and dysfunction by leaving now. Such a guy can drag down your entire life. So treat this rationally. Don't let your feelings for him cloud your wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	Frankly, why are you settling for this shit? It's like you go to a nice restuarant, they serve you a turd, and you persist in eating it. Stand up and walk out.

<p>
	It tends to be both sudden and gradual. The deepest insights are sudden and startling. But they are deepened gradually over time as one chews on them.
</p>

<p>
	To realize something like What is God?, or What is no-self?, or What is Love?, etc. these come as shocking, sudden epiphanies. They are not merely insights, they are totally new states of consciousness. Such a thing will startle you. It's not gonna just creep up on you quietly.
</p>

<p>
	Gradual expansion of baseline awareness via mediation is good and important. But that's not good enough. You need those epic mindfuck epiphanies which reveal facets of the Absolute.

<p>
	No, memory is mental imagery. That is not consciousness proper. That is mind activity.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute cannot be stored in memory. Memory happens inside the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	This is a crucial mistake. You cannot get to the Absolute through memory.

</p>

<p>
	You are still denying that you are God. You are still creating duality. You are still not taking back your full authority. You are still not realizing that God is infinite limitation.
</p>

<p>
	You have deeper to go. Your awakening is half-baked.
</p>

<p>
	"You are not God and never will be" << that is pure devilry, the opposite of Truth.

<p>
	It's a delicate balance of staying open to feedback and willing to re-asses one's position, but also being very clear about what the Absolute Truth is and not giving an inch when it comes to that.
</p>

<p>
	One of the fruits of lots of serious self-inquiry is that you become grounded in direct experience so deeply that other people's ideas/beliefs no longer become important.
</p>

<p>
	Basically you ground yourself in Consciousness, God, Truth, and Love. When you are coming from that place, nothing else matters and you have true strength.
</p>

You need to communicate authentically with him. Tell him exactly what you told us and leave room for him to speak his mind.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be a relationship without honest and genuine communication where both partners can air their thoughts & feelings without argumentation or debate. It's called "clearing". You two sit down, each takes 5 minutes to talk without interruption and gets everything of his/her chest. Then you switch sides. No interrupting, no debating, no rebutting, no justifying, no criticizing, no name-calling, no blaming. Just say how you feel and what you want. Let him do the same.
</p>

<p>
	Of course he must be emotionally mature enough to handle this kind of communication.
</p>

<p>
	If he cannot handle it, if he refuses to try it and put effort into it, then leave him because it will never work anyway. A relationship with such a person is impossible.
</p>

<p>
	Masculine/feminine is a duality. You cannot define yourself as a man without simultaneously defining yourself a not a woman.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really work on one without affecting the other.

	Consciousness & lots of awakening.

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot.
</p>

<p>
	You have many, many layers of inauthenticity to shed. It's difficult to see how deep your inauthenticity goes without psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Deep authenticity is impossible so long as you are dominated by fear and survival -- and the ego is all about fear and survival.

<p>
	That is the crux of the matter.
</p>

<p>
	That is gonna limit your growth. The highest wisdom will not be supported by society at all. You will be all on your own. In fact, people will tear your down and demonize you and call you crazy. And you have to be wise and strong enough to laugh off their ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Ignorant people love to gaslight the wise with their ignorance. You gotta rise above this kinda thing because you will encounter it a lot going forward. I get it on a daily basis.

	If you are male, female itself is your shadow.
</p>

<p>
	You are not really male or female. Both are dualities. You include and transcend both.

<p>
	Work more on integrating your feminine. That's part of what gayness is about.

<p>
	A) American healthcare has massive profit margins. You cannot compare it to other countries. Cutting those profit margins is very hard because they don't want to give it up. It's like taking away crack from an addict.
</p>

<p>
	B) If all the sick people are offloaded onto public plans, public plans will pay all the cost while private plans will offer cheap insurance for healthy people who don't need it. For the public plan to be affordable it needs to contain many healthy people to offset the sick ones. This is how insurance works.
</p>

<p>
	Having a single giant pool is ideal. Then everyone is invested in it and no one can manipulate it or want to cut it.
</p>

<p>
	People on private plans will want to cut public plans because it doesn't benefit them.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why private plans are not allowed in many countries which have a public system.

I'm telling you from personal experience at 18 I had a permanent enlightenment experience that put me in the now due to nearly a decade of depression and suicidality. It made depression go away and it felt like peace on steroids with a sense of awe and wonder that I can tap into to this day. Yes I can say that experience is real. However the idea of everything having consciousness has not come to me. I'm more than open to it I am a truth seeker however as of yet I've not reached that truth. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, I mean enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever your experience was, it could have been a genuine awakening but it was still just like dipping your toe in the ocean.
</p>

<p>
	There is much deeper and wider to go.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees and facets to awakening. Deep and total awakening is extremely rare. Mostly people get glimpses.
</p>

<p>
	You have much more to contemplate and understand.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you are not conscious of what consciousness is, what reality is, or what other is. Which is why you ask your question.
</p>

<p>
	If you were fully awake you would not be asking if rocks have consciousness.

<p>
	Nothing "has" consciousness. Consciousness has all things. Your paradigm is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: What Is Consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	How can you know? By awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You are not doing the practices. That doesn't fly in this work.

<p>
	This is fairly typical if you go deep into the work.
</p>

<p>
	The devil is not controlling you. The devil is purely imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	If you're feeling lost and down, you can lean on the power of love.
</p>

<p>
	Self-love is what you are missing.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can give you a powerful love awakening which really helps to take the sting out of this work.

	Look, people have different genetics, brains, and psyches. They process things differently and chemicals affect them differently.
</p>

<p>
	Clearly psychedelics are not for him.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like he is extremely sensitive to them and he has zero foundation for it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that some people actually are psychotic, psychopathic, etc.

	There is no robot consciousness. There is no human consciousness. There is just consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're asking, "Is the goal of my TV screen to become Mario? Or robot Mario?" No! The goal of your TV screen is be free of attachment from any shape so that it can display all shapes.

</p>

<p>
	"Niv Sch" will confuse people because it will mean nothing to them. They will not even recognize that as your name and they won't know how to pronounce it or spell it.
</p>

<p>
	It is helpful to create a catchy brand name that's unique and easy to remember and pronounce. That alone won't ever make you successful or popular, but having a low quality brand name just makes your life needlessly difficult.
</p>

<p>
	If I named by channel: "dksfulxkjNdfww", that would be a problem.

<p>
	You're misunderstanding a few key points.
</p>

<p>
	1) All models are limited. There is no such thing as "a valid model".
</p>

<p>
	2) You are expecting a social consensus and authority on cutting edge insights which almost no humans know about. That's not how knowledge works. Maybe in 100 years you will have that. But by that point your presention will be useless because everyone will already know it. The whole point of cutting edge teachings is that people will deny them like subborn mules. So this idea of using authority firgures to prove your point is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	3) You need to spend a lot more time studying Spiral Dynamics and developmental psychology in genernal before you can appreciate what SD offers and its limitations.
</p>

<p>
	4) SD is a very complex model which maps very complex phenomena. This is not like mapping a few molecules or billard balls, which is easy compared to mapping the collective human psyche.
</p>

<p>
	You are bastardizing the notion of self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	The real self-deception here is thinking you know anything about the future.
</p>

<p>
	The truth here is very simple: nobody knows what will happen in 2020 until it happens. Everything here is guesswork and speculation.
</p>

<p>
	It is okay to speculate sometimes. But at least be honest with yourself that you are speculating.
</p>

<p>
	Claiming that something as dicey as the 2020 election is inevitable is the very definition of self-deception and goes against everything I teach.
</p>

<p>
	Accept that you just don't know. That is truthful.
</p>

<p>
	You are not surrendering to reality here, you are constructing fantasies and confusing them for reality.
</p>

<p>
	Not really. They are nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Existence as you're using that term is still dualistic and something your mind is imagining.
</p>

<p>
	It's all absolutely nothing in the final analysis.

<title>Does this 5-MeO-DMT look good?</title>

<p>
	That is an acceptable texture and color.
</p>

<p>
	Texture and color of 5-Meo-DMT can vary quite a bit. Depends on which lab made it. Depends on freebase vs HCl vs oxalate. But don't assume that all freebase or all HCl looks the same. There is still a lot of variety in texture and color. Some is like a very dry fine powder. Some is almost sticky and clumpy. Some is more crystal-like.
</p>

<p>
	None of that matters so long as it's 98%+ pure 5-MeO-DMT. Which it probably is if it's 5-MeO-DMT at all. If a lab is capable of making 5-MeO-DMT at all, it doesn't cost them anything to make it 98% pure. There is little point in cutting research chemicals with junk. It's not cocaine or heroin which gets cut with junk by a long chain of middlemen to drive down costs. The research chemical industry doesn't work that way.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest risk with research chemicals is if they accidentally give you the wrong substance simply due to mislabeling it.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO has a subtle distinctive smell you can learn to distinguish. This makes for a nice easy sniff test. It's not fool proof, but a good way to make sure it's on the right track.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You are not conscious of what you are doing. You create suffering because you are attached to being a self and staying alive.
</p>

<p>
	To stop creating suffering you'd have to die. But that's unacceptable to you.
</p>

<p>
	You're stuck inside your own insane dream, not understanding how you locked yourself inside. Awakening is the process of investigating how you locked yourself inside.

<p>
	Ideally you'd get to a point where you are satisfied with just sitting silence. But that's a tall order to fill.
</p>

<p>
	I like to take late night drives around town and look at the city.
</p>

<p>
	Act activity you do you're gonna eventually "wear out" unless you're able to be satisfied just sitting in silence like a cat.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind constantly craves stimulation, excitement, and newness -- which creates suffering. A large part of the function of meditation is to train that out of you so you can be more cat-like and thrive off of presence and being alone. But again, this takes lots of training and it will come with suffering through lots of boredom which the ego-mind will create.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a state of mental development in which you are happier sitting like a cat than others are playing video games, watching movies, smoking pot, or having sex. Can you see how powerful this would make you?
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not really rigged, it's just asymmetrical.
</p>

<p>
	For every girl playing Tinder there's a guy playing Tinder.
</p>

<p>
	Ladies don't just play Tinder. Ladies invest a ton of energy rigging their lives to attract guys. Most of it is done unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
	For example, how much time and money does a lady spend shopping and applying makeup in her life? How much energy does she invest in building and maintaining a social circle that later feeds her vetted mates? 1000s of hours go into this for attractive females.
</p>

<p>
	Mating is a highly sophisticated game which goes on under the radar of our consciousness. It's more sophisticated than a game of chess. But all of it just happens automatically.

That's very common for newbies. As you fail over and over again you'll start seeing patterns in how your needy and weak behavior turns them off.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of practice.
</p>

<p>
	At this point you would benefit from learning a bit of the fundamental theory behind female attraction. Most important for you is correcting your sub-communication: your eye contact, your body posture, your tone of voice, your physical touching, your smile, your attitude, your presence, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This is the most important part of game. It's not the things you say, its how and why you say them, and the things you don't say.
</p>

<p>
	You can attract women just by looking at them in the right way.
</p>

<p>
	If your interactions are dominated by fear, neediness, attachment, trying to impress her, trying to get her to like you, meekness, or being a dancing monkey -- you will lose a lot of girls.
</p>

<p>
	It's important that your interactions carry a man-to-woman sexual charge/intent. When you look at her in the eyes, she should feel like if you are ever alone with her you will fuck her. This is very different from your typical friendly chit-chat. You don't need to say anything sexual, but your intent needs to be clear from the very beginning. Look at her like you're going to fuck her. You have to risk getting rejected. Those who don't reject you will hook hard.
</p>

<p>
	When you are fearful, she can see it in your eyes and hear it in your tone of voice.
</p>

<p>
	Work on your smile. Make sure you're able to smile a lot and on cue. Always open with a smile.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to pump up your own emotional state so that you're in a good state when you're talking to her. State is huge. If you're in a bad emotional state she will sense it off you and react negatively.
</p>

<p>
	The ideal state is playful, carefree, yet decisive.
</p>

<title>How is demonic possession explained in the context of oneness?</title>

			You said elsewhere also that god is maximizing love, does that mean it always is developing toward even more love? Or is Infinite love not something that can grow and is always as it is, what does maximizing love mean then?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Depends on what perspective you take.
</p>

<p>
	From the absolute perspective, there is no time, so Infinity unfolds at once. It has always been completely acutalized. From the human perspective Infinity unfolds linearly over time.
</p>

<p>
	Doesn't matter which way look at it, the structure of all of reality is explained by the desire to maximize Love. From God's POV this Love is already fully actualized while from the human POV this love is in the process of unfolding, evolving, and increasing. And actually, we humans are in a process of co-creating it.
</p>

<p>
	So imagine a film director who wanted to make a movie that displayed love in the most loving way possible. Which scenes would he put int he movie? Whichever ones maximized love. Then the audience would watch the movie and see it unfolding slowly over time. But from the director's POV, the movie is already complete. In either case, the movie is maximizing love.
</p>

<p>
	But there is one additional wrinkle. To truly maximize love God had to create an infinite number of beings who could participate in the co-creation of the movie. So it's like the movie director created a trillion other movie directors and gave them an opportunity to direct one scene each for his epic mega-movie -- all of which would add up to The Love Movie.
</p>

<p>
	Love is maximized by creating an infinite number of beings and giving each of them the opportunity to realize that they are God. All of reality is structured so this happens. This includes war, genocide, terrorism, murder, rape, theft, slavery, and everything else. All of it is necessary so that each being can experience being God.
</p>

<p>
	But God's Love is so infinite no finite being can handle it. It kills everyone.
</p>

<p>
	Death is Infinite Love and it is the last thing a finite being wants.
</p>

<p>
	You will die precisely because God loves you. But you are too ignorant and selfish to understand that. The good news is, you will die anyway. You are powerless to stop it. You can resist for a while, but eventually everyone succumbs to Truth and wakes up.
</p>

<p>
	The awakening process is going on. A tug of war between devil-consciousness and God-consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The devil will not go quietly.
</p>

<p>
	Purifying a lifetime of selfish habits, attachments, and defilements requires years of serious, deliberate work. It will NOT happen automatically overnight.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening will NOT erase all your defilements. If only it were so easy. The mind and body have a very strong inertia. Changing them is like derailing a freight train by throwing tennis balls.

<p>
	Of course. If that wasn't the case, how could people reach high states of consciousness without any psychedelics at all?
</p>

<p>
	The more psychedelics you do the more you will realize that there is no difference between a trip and real life. They are identical. You are always high.
</p>

<p>
	The more you trip the more your mind tunes into seeing the Absolute. And the psychedelics purify the mind and body of defilements which limit consciousness.

</p>

<p>
	Sex happens all the time for the dumbest reasons. All you need to do is go out and talk to girls.
</p>

<p>
	Sex cannot happen while you sit at home on the internet.
</p>

<p>
	All your attention should be on going out of your house and being face to face with lots of new girls. That's it. Do not worry about anything else.
</p>

<p>
	If you put yourself in lots of social situations girls will want to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	Tons of girls will reject you. It doesn't matter. Don't even think about it. Get rejected 10 times a day and you will stop caring.

<p>
	Everything you see is what Infinite Love looks like, including all demons and devils.

	But hey, don't take my word for it. Discover for yourselves how mating works.
</p>

<p>
	If you observe it carefully you should see that it's pure selfishness on both sides. It can be quite disgusting when you really look into it. After all, you would not be mating at all if not for survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, you don't mate with your vacuum cleaner. Why not?
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe some of you do? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> But again, that would also be purely to satisfy your survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	For this reason the male and female perspectives on mating when never be fully reconcilable because they are not interested in truth or fairness, they are interested in maximizing survival while justifying it as truth. So the key here is to notice the self-bias of both sides. You and your partner are both biased and in denial about it.

<title>Why I can't get laid just behaving authentically? Why I have to follow the rules?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/41790-why-i-cant-get-laid-just-behaving-authentically-why-i-have-to-follow-the-rules/?do=findComment&amp;comment=521317</link>

<p>
	Also remember that girls are not saints. Fundamentally mating is about survival for both man and women alike. So of course you will be judged by how well you fit into the other's survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	Girls are not obligated to love you no matter how you are. If your authentic way of acting is to be serial killer or some creeper, girls will rightfully reject you.
</p>

<p>
	Being authentic does not guarantee any level of results. Usually when we say "be authentic" we assume you will be acting within certain norms and criteria which girls find valuable and attractive.
</p>

<p>
	It can be easy to fool oneself into thinking that one's neuroses, bad habits, lack of socialization, and egotistical quirks are "authentic".
</p>

<p>
	Ex: Farting when you feel like it might be authentic, but don't expect it to attract girls off the street.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Reasonable people can disagree about how best to implement universal healthcare. Bernie's plan doesn't have to be the only way. Although I think it's a good idea to kill private insurance because they drive up costs too much while adding zero value.
</p>

<p>
	A universal healthcare plan which does not have a mechanism for cutting out gluttonous corporate profits is not really a plan at all. The key problem is affordability and profiteering. It is not possible to cover 330 million people while maintaining existing corporate profit margins. The profit margins are what needs to be attacked via a populist movement.

<p>
	Why would you think you're going backwards?
</p>

<p>
	Just because it's a difficult experience doesn't mean a damn thing. In fact, it means it's growing you -- the devil in you just doesn't like being purified.
</p>

<p>
	How did you think this awakening process would go? Did you really think you could awaken yet still keep the devil in you? And did you expect the devil to go quietly without bitching?
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's massively frustrating to awaken. Which is the only reason virtually nobody does it.
</p>

<p>
	Frustration is the cost of success.

<p>
	It's a sort of play.
</p>

<p>
	When you go to the movies, how come you care so much about what the characters are doing? You're there for fun. You know it's not real but you got nothing better to do.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, meaninglessness is a big paradox. It is difficult for the ego-mind, which has been addicted to constructing illusory meanings all its life, to suddenly operate without meaning. There is a difficult transition phase here which can last months or years, where the ego-mind will feel lost and directionless. But then you stabilize in emptiness and play.
</p>

<p>
	The point of life is PLAY! It's just like a video game. The mistake is that you take it too seriously because you are terrified of death and suffering. Imagine how bad video games would be if the main character was terrified of death?
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Consider that life having zero meaning is the ideal situation. It gives you total freedom to play. It's an infinite sand box game this way. Otherwise you'd be a slave to some limited set of pre-baked meanings. This would make life boring and lame.
</p>

<p>
	YOU. ARE. GOD! Invent whatever the fuck you want. It's all your whim.

	Watch my video about The Role Of Balance In Personal Development.
</p>

<p>
	Balance is a tricky business. You cannot ever formalize it because it is dynamic.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well ask me, "So how do I balance myself on a unicycle?"
</p>

<p>
	By doing it. No one can tell you in words how to do it.
</p>

<p>
	You should expect to fall over many, many times before you master it.
</p>

<p>
	There is a very fine line between getting laid and being a sociopath <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />
