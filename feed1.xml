<p>
	Nothingness is not what you imagine it to be. It's the opposite.

<p>
	1g should be fine.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms are awesome when you do them right.
</p>

<p>
	Even 1g will be the coolest experience of your life, if this is your first time doing psychedelics.

<p>
	I will explain it all at some point. I've discovered some powerful protocols which speed up meditation by like a factor of x100. Most people have never really meditated properly one hour in their life, until the machine shows you what true meditation feels like.

<p>
	I'm not going to get into that here because it's a very technical subject. The name of the machine is not the issue. The issue is the software and training protocols, which took me a month to research.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately EEG at-home training is just not accessible for but the most hardcore people. You're looking at at least a $2500 investment plus a month of hardcore research to training yourself how to use it.
</p>

<p>
	Wish it could be easier, but it isn't.

Although LSD can also get pretty hairy if you're not careful.
</p>

<p>
	For me, 5-MeO is always positive unless I don't do it on an empty stomach. Oddly, small doses tend to produce nausea for me more than larger doses. 22-25mg is the sweet spot. Lower doses can feel wonky without the full breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	But everyone is different. People can definitely get into bad trips with 5-MeO if they don't know what they're getting into.
</p>

<p>
	One man's Infinity is another man's hell.
</p>

<p>
	I always treat each trip with mild trepidation and great care, like handling a loaded gun. I think as soon as you get cocky, it's like you're asking for a bad trip, and you will get one.
</p>

<title>Held back by negative motivation to grow</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Accept yourself as you are. Surrender to the whatever the actuality is. Forget about evolving (for a while).
</p>

<p>
	This is simple advice, but hard to actually do because it will take your mind a lot of beating around the bush before it even starts to admit all the ways you don't accept yourself. "Evolution" is part of the ego's habitual agenda, believe it or not. The counter-intuitive move is to drop it.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: How To Love Yourself
</p>

<p>
	The deepest evolution comes from acceptance. But it has to be a radical, deep acceptance. A deep surrender. Which isn't something you just do by thinking about it for 5 minutes. You gotta really work at the acceptance.
</p>

Even if you slide all the way back, you're really not the same any more. You will move ahead much faster now.
</p>

<p>
	Your state will fluctuate a lot. Don't use state as a measure of growth. It's the wisdom and lessons learned that really matter, even if your state is sucky right now.

<p>
	This is wrong.
</p>

<p>
	It's very obvious what God is when once you awaken. You are it.
</p>

<p>
	Any supernatural or mystical phenomena will be lesser than awakening. There is a lot supernatural phenomena possible within the field of spirituality, but awakening will beat them all. Don't get distracted with shiny objects.

Don't create limiting beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	Even a householder can plan a few 10-day retreats strategically throughout the year.
</p>

<p>
	The real question is, do you want to awaken? If you do, you'll find a way. And doesn't have to mean ditching your family.

<p>
	That's just cause you guys are taking the wrong substances in the wrong ways.
</p>

<p>
	What trippers do not realize is how important the substance is. They trip on the wrong psychedelics in the wrong ways, gets some bad trips, and take that as a message to hang up the phone.
</p>

<p>
	When you're tripping the right way, you won't be told to hang up the phone for 100+ trips. There is too much wisdom there to hang up on. The hang up happens because the mind isn't ready to handle it, and went too deep too fast.
</p>

<p>
	When I hear someone saying they took 5 trips and got the message to hang up the phone, I laugh. That's like driving 5 miles outside your city and realizing, "Welp, I guess I've seen all the world has offer. Time to head back home."
</p>

<p>
	Tripping requires persistence and patience and exploration of many different substances to find the right ones.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In regards to what?
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate Absolute Truth??? That's so profound and reality-shattering that you cannot possibly miss it. It doesn't take place at the level of knowledge or intellect or language. Instead, you can think of it as a breaking of your entire perceptual system.
</p>

<p>
	Minor insights just have a ring of truth of them. I don't know how to describe it. You feel it intuitively. But of course, you must be careful in that you could always be deluding yourself with minor insights because the mind is heavily involved.
</p>

<p>
	An Absolute insight is so deep that even as you're experiencing it, you cannot pin it down with words. It would be like seeing aliens invading from outer space. You'd be so shocked you'd be speechless, and it would have nothing whatsoever to do with a story.
</p>

<p>
	There a clear difference between a story of an alien and witnessing an actual alien invasion happening right now.
</p>

<p>
	If you're verbalizing it, it's not Absolute, it's mental. Mental insights can still be valuable and great, but they are nowhere near Absolute insights -- which are the mystical insights that are the most life-transforming.
</p>

<p>
	The easiest way to quickly get a sense of this difference is via a psychedelic. It will immediately show you the difference.
</p>

The more you try to force an insight, the less likely it tends to come. You gotta be in a relaxed state of mind.
</p>

<p>
	If you're seeking existential insights (like enlightenment) then those require enormous amounts of concentration, and they do not come as knowledge or ideas, they come as radical shift in your experience of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Minor insights are more intellectual.
</p>

<p>
	A blank mind is good. "I don't know" is also good. But it will probably take a lot longer than 1 hour to get your answer. It might take 100 hours.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta take into account that some of these answers you're seeking are MASSIVE. They aren't just an intellectual answer. They are life-transforming, so the large investment in time and energy will be worthwhile in the end.
</p>

<p>
	The insights will be much harder to get than you first expect. But they will also be much more amazing too, so it balances out in the end.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's possible to know what fear or a feeling is. It's even possible to know what all of existence is, what God is, or what death is.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 factor that determines the effectiveness of contemplation is your ability to laser-focus on the present moment without distraction for long periods of time. Imagine focus so great that you feel like you could burn a hole through a steel plate. That's what really deep contemplation requires. It's not easy to do.
</p>

<p>
	Or, the way I like to do it is let my mind wander around and randomly stumble upon insights. But this doesn't work so well for deep existential insights. It works better for minor psychological or life insights.
</p>

<p>
	No, I've probably only scratched the surface of how deep the insanity goes. I don't really care to ever experience it again. Which is why I stay away from mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	McKenna had some mushroom trips that were supposedly so terrifying he never took them again.
</p>

<p>
	I'd stick to AL-LAD or 1P-LSD. I think if you play around with mushrooms long enough, they will scare the shit out of you and probably sour your whole attitude towards psychedelics.

<p>
	Oh, BTW, 5-MeO-DMT must be done an a totally empty stomach. No eating for like 4 hours at least.
</p>

<p>
	You will be very sorry otherwise. I've noticed the trips can start to get wonky with even a bit of food.
</p>

<p>
	I've also noticed the trips get wonky for me if done in the morning.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise I never get nausea.

You literally become God.
</p>

<p>
	Your motivation should be: I want to know what reality is and why it exists!
</p>

<p>
	Tap into that deep curiosity until it's the primary thing driving your life.
</p>

<p>
	Or find some other way to frame it. If you're a God-believing person, then you could frame it as: I want to know what God is!
</p>

<p>
	Since you are young and in high school, you have LOTS of free time, especially during the summer. Stop screwing around and do a 10-day meditation retreat. You can easily get a glimpse into awakening within those 10 days. And then you'll have your motivation.
</p>

			I am currently experimenting with 5-MeO-MET. I have gone up to only 12 mg at the moment. It seems like a good alternative for 5-MeO-DMT. Comparing to the low dose reports, it's the same thing, but longer acting. Will tell you the results of higher doses when I get there.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's really interesting. I've been researching 5-MeO-MET as a good alternative. Trip reports about it are very limited and unreliable.
</p>

<p>
	Share more of your findings with us. I'm really curious how it compares to 5-MeO-DMT. From what I've read, MET has less ego-dissolution, which would be bad thing. We want maximum ego-dissolution and minimum body-high and visuals.
</p>

<p>
	But it still seems promising.

			Hey Leo,
		</p>

		<p>
			During last blog video when you took 5-meo multiple days in a row, I was wondering, what dosage did you use? did you do multiple high dosages, multiple low dosages, or slowly progress from low to high?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I've found my perfect dose now through lots of experimentation. 22-25mg rectally.
</p>

<p>
	Below 20mg is powerful, but not quite fully Infinite. 25mg is just to the point where any more would be too much to tolerate.
</p>

<p>
	At least that's for me. Everyone will be a bit different.
</p>

<p>
	On my retreat all of my doses were in the 20-22mg range. A few of the doses didn't work as planned because my plugging technique wasn't perfected yet and also because weighing out substance accurately is quite challenging even on a milligram scale, especially in a humid environment.
</p>

<p>
	I want to transition to volumetric dosing because the scale is just not consistent.
</p>

<p>
	These <a href="https://amzn.to/2r2RXpH" rel="external nofollow">micro scoops</a> should do the trick.
</p>

<p>
	They can take you to infinity, but the road will be twisted.
</p>

<p>
	Breaking through that barrier of insanity is a really important step. So long as you're afraid of going insane, you're not yet capable of contemplating the nature of reality. The Truth lies beyond insanity.
</p>

<p>
	You may want to upgrade to a less twisted psychedelic, like LSD.
</p>

<p>
	The trouble with mushrooms is, it can be hard to integrate their lessons because they can be so twisted.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is the polar opposite of that. You get Infinity without any twist, which is ideal. I haven't found any other psychedelic which is as clear and as direct. Most psychedelics are murky and capricious. The visual distortions also get in the way. And mushrooms fuck with your memory and sense of time in a weird way. They sort of hypnotize you.

</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Psychedelics
	</li>
	<li>

<p>
	No, no, no.

<p>
	The ego self is your physical existence. The idea that were born and are alive.

<p>
	The no-self is death of that.

	Imagine that one day your life just ended. Like you were never even born. But your body keeps on living. That is enlightenment.

<p>
	What people fail to understand about enlightenment is that "being alive" and "being born" and "physical existence" are just IDEAS! And once you realize they are IDEAS, all of reality will unravel and your life will collapse into Infinity.

	Physical existence is not a fact. It is an IDEA.

<p>
	Yup, sad.
</p>

<p>
	That's what happens when materialism goes to its fullest conclusion. It is totally hollow, and the more successful you become, the more you start to see the truth of that.
</p>

<p>
	Most poor people are lucky because they will never get successful enough to realize just how pointless success is.
</p>

<p>
	It's very hard to believe unless you actually start to experience this phenomena for yourself. After you get all of the material stuff you most-wanted, the very next day will be the worse day of your life. So be ready for that. Have an escape plan.
</p>

<p>
	Materialism corrupts creativity because creativity is a spiritual pursuit.

<p>
	The Hero's Journey doesn't say anything about sidekicks.
</p>

<p>
	There are Threshold Guardians which lead up to the final Boss. Those Threshold Guardians are obstacles the Hero must overcome, because every journey has obstacles, otherwise it wouldn't be a journey but an amusement park ride.
</p>

<p>
	In practical terms, if your goal -- let's say -- is to kill Hitler, you're gonna face his goons before you get to him. Powerful people surround themselves with guards and delegate tasks to henchmen. If they didn't, they wouldn't be powerful.

<p>
	Enlightenment Intensives are very.... INTENSE. They will definitely push you hard and you will grow in more ways than one.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston's teaching style is very advanced. He doesn't coddle you at all. Most people will not get the depth of what he has to offer because he doesn't present it in an easily accessible, mainstream-ized way.
</p>

<p>
	But the Enlightenment Intensive is just dyads. You do not get any "teachings" or theory during an Intensive. It's just a week of pure self-inquiry in a very structured setting, with partners.
</p>

			I have a question for the ones more experienced with this substance.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have been experimenting with 5-MeO for a short while now with mild results only. My last try was the most I have done - 27mcg 5-MeO-DMT HCl plugged. I experienced some purging via energy shifting, but it did not feel too spectacular (very comparable to a short time of the shamanic breathing). I expected something more dramatic or powerful at this amount of 5-MeO.
		</p>

		<p>
			Should I proceed with 30 and go up?
		</p>

		<p>
			Or should I try 30  and just stick with 30 until something clicks?
		</p>

		<p>
			What could be the optimal dosing in my case?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I'm not sure why 5-MeO seems to not work on certain people. Or it works much less effectively. Probably has something to do with differences in brain physiology and also innate spiritual attunement. My guess is, not all human brains are equally susceptible to 5-MeO-DMT. I'm guessing you need to have the right structures already present in the brain which can utilize the 5-MeO, otherwise not much happens. Either you require large dosages or maybe this chemical is just not the right one for you. Do you have a high tolerance to other psychedelics like LSD or mushrooms?
</p>

<p>
	20mg of 5-MeO should produce radical shifts in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You may want to experiment with smoking/vaporizing it. Just be careful with dosage. Smoked dosages need to be MUCH smaller. Start with something like 5mg smoked, then work up to 10mg, then 15mg.
</p>

<p>
	And what if all of these conspiracy concerns are just a false flag operation masterminded by a race of Troll-people who live deep under ground to rise up and take over mankind?
</p>

<p>
	Allow me to pull out my Glenn Beck chalkboard and connect some dots for you...
</p>

<p>
	The Clinton Foundation, working closely with the Globalists, have been sending emails deep down under the Earth's mantle, as evidenced by their email server in Hawaii near the volcano.
</p>

<p>
	Now you ask, "But Leo! Why would Hilary Clinton want to ally herself with the Troll-people?"
</p>

<p>
	This should be obvious: They are both pedophiles.
</p>

<p>
	How do we know this?
</p>

<p>
	They both like to eat pizza. Which their child slaves bake for them in the underground volcanic pizza ovens.
</p>

<p>
	Why do you think the US has such a strong military presence in Honolulu? To keep the Troll-people in check, of course.
</p>

<p>
	Now you say, "Yeah, Leo, it sounds so silly when you put it like that."
</p>

<p>
	But that's just what they want you to think! It's precisely because it sounds so absurd that they can get away it!
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Check out my new Alpha-Male-Bro multivitamin pack coming the Actualized.org store. It's got calcium which we extract from the crushed skulls of arctic baby seals. We crush their skulls by hand to make sure the bone dust is 100% pure, unlike all the other brands. Make sure to buy a few year's supply because these suckers are flying off the shelves and you never know when those Troll-people will shut down the internet as the first step in their quest for world domination. Because they know that step #1 to subduing the population is by reducing their calcium and testosterone levels, turning them into effeminate beta-cucks, allowing the government to take away all our automatic weapons.

<p>
	Even if they are true, they do not belong here because they are distracting.
</p>

<p>
	Even if the CIA killed JFK, what does that change for you? Nothing. Now you just become more paranoid and judgmental. Whatever the CIA is hiding, your own mind is doing even more such hiding within you.
</p>

<p>
	Allowing for discussion of conspiracy theories quickly devolves into Alex Jones -type nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I think it is totally plausible that the CIA or some other internal elements of the government killed JFK. But that is irrelevant, and all it boils down to is speculation.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is, there's a lot we don't know about the world.

		</p>

		<p>
			Your video on the subject has not changed ?  Have you researched the topic?  Have you been honest with your community that it is oxygen deprevation causing the effcts? 
		</p>

		<p>
			How has this been resolved exactly ? 
		</p>

		<p>
			I am not being hysterical that would be a projection of your mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			 I just want you to eather research the pracice yourself  and tell you commnity what is the mechinism aka reason the  experance is happening  OR I want you to tell people you are too lazy to do the reasearch and that it is ok to make decisions based on ignorance and bias instead knowledge and wisdom
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			 I expect you to live up to your own standards ..... 
		</p>

		<p>
			 Or I guess you can just avoid this post like all the others that seems to be your new path. Enlightenment though avoidance and deflection.  
		</p>

		<p>
			What I am asking is simple concede that the effects are from lack of oxygen And that the reason the effects are happing are that through his technique you are starving your brain of the oxygen it needs untill it basically can not function. This is the truth so why is it so hard for you to admit ?  
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, the effects could be due to lack of oxygen due to an initial increase in oxygen, which then leads to an even greater increase in CO2, which is what then produces the beneficial effects.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I am unconcerned about this is because this is technical minutia. It does not matter to me if this technique ultimately works via net total oxygen deprivation. I have done enough research to see that the technique is reasonably safe and beneficial for the majority of people doing it responsibly.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, early Christian Baptism worked by submerging the head underwater until the person nearly drowned. Triggering a near-death experience. That is real mysticism for ya. Spiritual techniques can be pretty hardcore. And I don't consider Shamanic Breathing anywhere near as dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	Having technical knowledge does not reduce ignorance nor increase wisdom. You could have the CO2 mechanism right, but your conclusion about not doing Shamanic Breathing could still be wrong. This would be the greater mistake. My concern is not debating scientific minutia (which is always subject to error and misleading interpretations such as you are doing) but with high-level, holistic understanding -- which is where my advice comes from. My advice is never based on technical studies, but on a deeper holistic intuitive understanding of reality.
</p>

<p>
	What you are claiming as scientific fact is actually your interpretation. You are misusing science by taking it so much on face-value, without proper context. You are ignoring the extent to which your mind is interpreting "the facts".
</p>

<p>
	I did not take any corrective action because none is needed. What I did was address your concerns by pointing out that you are taking your science out of context. Obviously you disagree, and you're free to do so.
</p>

<p>
	Tens of thousands of people have done Shamanic Breathing without damage in workshops all over the world. That is proof enough for me. This isn't rocket science.
</p>

<p>
	A) My fame level is tiny compared to his.
</p>

<p>
	B) It has been challenging managing even my tiny level of fame. Fame is like jet fuel for the ego-mind. It worsens all of your basest proclivities. I have to be very mindful not to get the fame go to my head, and still, sometimes it does.
</p>

<p>
	C) I have been doing lots of personal development work unlike most successful people, so I can do a self-diagnosis much better and I know what all the solutions and traps are, so I know what to do if things get really bad.
</p>

<p>
	D) Low to moderate levels of fame are actually quite nice, as long as you are spiritually mature and you aren't chasing after it. It's the mega-levels of fame where things can start to get ugly. Tom Cruise levels of fame are toxic, I think. You don't want everyone in the world to recognize you.

<p>
	A) Awakening to Truth does not necessarily end all suffering or pain.
</p>

<p>
	B) Chemical addictions (like alcohol) can be very stubborn and will not change by seeing Truth alone.
</p>

<p>
	C) There are many degrees of awakening. While Alan Watts clearly had some degree of awakening, I doubt he had Buddha-like abiding nondual awareness or a perpetual state of Nirvana.
</p>

<p>
	D) Awakening alone WILL NOT transform or develop the self. It will not clear all the chakras, all the bad habits, it will not fix all the mind's neuroses, it will not make you a good person, and it will not produce emotional mastery or life mastery. Many psychological problems can be distinct from existential understanding.
</p>

<p>
	E) After awakening, life must go on. Boredom can still set in and alcohol could be a nice distraction for some. After all, what is there to do, really? After awakening there is no need to do anything. There is not even the need to do good or be good.
</p>

<p>
	F) You have no control over anything. Whatever happens is inevitable. Alan Watts had no ability to stop anything. Whatever the universe has in store for you, is what will happen, and you are surrendered to that.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, stop expecting enlightenment to make you superman or a saint, or to fix all your Earthly problems.
</p>

	The body and mind has addictions and habits which will continue long after enlightenment in many cases.
</p>

<p>
	Of course enlightenment is helpful for getting you more consciousness over your addictions, but that doesn't automatically end addictions.
</p>

<p>
	Alan Watts seemed to have some degree of awakening and yet seemed to be an alcoholic.
</p>

<p>
	After various awakening experiences I've had, my internet and smartphone addictions, for example, did not magically disappear. I could still feel the mind and body mechanically reaching for my phone or the internet. The brain's job is to maintain the body's survival, and that means lots of bias towards homeostasis regardless of whatever truth you've just seen.
</p>

<p>
	After all, after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. The dream must go on, and as long as you're inside the dream, you are subject to it rules.
</p>

<p>
	Your individuality, post-awakening, will be grounded in being the entire universe. You can't get more unique and individual than that! But that includes every atom and every other living being that has ever existed or will ever exist.
</p>

<p>
	Your little ego will dissolve as if it never existed, and then "you" will just be the universe.
</p>

<p>
	What you experienced there on mushrooms was a step in the right direction, but still far shy of total nonduality, at which point even the thought or memory of ever being an ego makes no sense any more. You become so universal that there is no difference between living and dying as a body.
</p>

<p>
	In total nonduality it makes no sense to even ask the question, "Where will I go after I die?" Because you are forever infinite and cannot die.
</p>

<title>Avicii: Another example of why personal development is necessary</title>

<p>
	A very common issue for artists.
</p>

<p>
	Confusing success for growth/happiness is one of the biggest traps there is. Nearly all mega-successful people fall into it. Which is WHY they're mega-successful. People who realize that success != happiness would never work so hard to accumulate the mega-success that people like Avicii get, because it often comes at a great expense to one's happiness and sense of peace.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this problem is made even worse with the low-consciousness club party culture in which Avicii swam.
</p>

<p>
	We have all the big name DJs here in Vegas. I often wonder how they can keep playing night after the night, the same stuff. After a year or two of that, it must become the lamest job in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like he was at least wise enough to stop touring several years ago.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that most such people don't even know there is any other dimension to life besides the material and the creative one. The spiritual dimension is not considered seriously because religion and science have made such a mockery of spirituality.
</p>

	The Truth is one. That's not the issue. There is a pragmatic issue: how permeated is your mind & life by the Truth? To what degree are you aware of it? How deeply do you see/feel it? What is your everyday level of consciousness? Which facets of the Truth has your mind understood, and how deeply?

			theyre trying to do something similar with the bosnian pyramids. I still cant decide if they are legit pyramids or not, i went to the seminar where semir osmanagic presented himself, and they talked about how women would actually try to conceive a child in pyramid, because of the pyramids transmission powers, the baby born will become 'enlightened' much more easier. Not sure how much i believe this, but there certainly no doubt is something powerful about the giza pyramids. Why hasnt someone tried to replicate it else where, exactly how they made the giza ones (with the limestone cover&all), to test theories out?

But you have to understand how to understand what you're hearing and put it into proper context and avoid the trap of subscribing to ideological positions in service of self-survival.

</p>

<p>
	1) That whole "I am struggling to kill myself... this is so difficult..." is itself a farce. It's the ego over-dramatizing its own death. It's the final form of egotism to overcome. The ego loves to make a big deal out of dying.
</p>

<p>
	2) Tap into love. It conquers all fear. Including the fear of death. When you feel like you cannot go any further, tap into love and let it overtake you. Push, but let go of control.
</p>

<p>
	Peterson is distracted in the Lesser Jihad. He is wrapped up in waging an intellectual crusade, and his followers are doing the same.
</p>

<p>
	All of these issues of men's rights, liberalism, capitalism vs Marxism, etc. are issues of self-survival. Which is orthogonal to consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness has nothing to do with intellectual crusading. Consciousness reveals that all intellectual, moral, and idealistic positions are false, and ultimately obstacles to the solution of the worlds problems.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move in this case is to drop the desire to argue and turn inward.
</p>

<p>
	All criticism is untenable. Anyone who takes their own criticisms of anything in reality seriously has not awoken. Criticism comes from the arrogance of thinking you know what is right and that you are in control.
</p>

<p>
	Classic self-deception traps. All of this I explained in my Self-Deception episodes.

<p>
	Careful with the Hare Krishnas. They have a big collective ego and they will brainwash you with their dogmas. Regardless of any spiritual benefits which you might accrue (and there probably are some great spiritual benefits to their practices).
</p>

<p>
	You want to be spiritual without becoming a group-think zombie.
</p>

<p>
	Practices alone are not the only factor. The other factor that's really important is inclusiveness and broad understanding of all spiritual traditions, without attachment to any particular one.

When you closely observe your inner nature, you will come to the same basic conclusions. The parallels exist because anyone who studies human nature honestly will tend to see the same core principles at work. It's really just a question of how deeply you go down the rabbit hole, and how you choose to express your insights, from within which cultural background.

<p>
	Awakening is not really logical in the end. It will not make sense to you from within the ego.
</p>

<p>
	The key point is: you cannot locate yourself no matter how hard you look. Notice that. That should make you very suspicious of this thing you call "me".

<title>Quitting everything to become a monk?</title>

<p>
	FYI, you can become a monk/yogi totally solo, without joining any group.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is only for those of you destined to be hardcore mystics. This is not something to attempt casually.

<p>
	This is all fine and good, but do not confuse emotional mastery or lack of suffering or bliss with enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	They are separate things.
</p>

<p>
	This is not to say you shouldn't do "The Work" if it appeals to you.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is about realizing what reality is.

</p>

<p>
	My impression of Osho (and this could just be my projection), was that he was so absorbed in nonduality he didn't give a fuck about human afairs here on Earth. And so things here on Earth got out of hand.
</p>

<p>
	If Osho didn't want to be involved with managing a community, he shouldn't have started such a big one.
</p>

<p>
	He also may have had parts of his shadow which he never worked through. His love of luxury, oppulance, sex, drugs, and adoration from fans all seem fishy. Those are lower chakra desires.
</p>

<p>
	It was obvious to me from the get-go, when Sheela said that she didn't care about enlightenment or meditation, but only serving Osho, that that would lead to great evil.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot have a human being leading a spirtual community of 1000s who is herself not doing any spiritual purifcation work. That will lead to obvious disaster. A leader must be more conscious than her followers, and always working to improve and humble herself.

<p>
	The two are not mutually exclusive.
</p>

<p>
	Osho was reckless AND the government probably put him on thier shit list.
</p>

<p>
	It's the government's job to maintain a sense of dualistic reality on behalf of their egoic population.
</p>

<p>
	We cannot have a guru becoming too popular. He will always be taken down once his influence starts to destablize the status quo enough.
</p>

<p>
	Gurus must keep a low profile. Not rock the boat too much. Which is why gurus are traditionally confined to a small isolated community which never gets mainstream coverage so the populace at large has no idea such things as awakening are possible.

			Hey Leo,  I know it is not the main topic but I wanted to ask you : I have done a Vipassana retreat and I am very motivated to do the experience again. My only concern is about my kriya practice that I have started almost for 1 month now. When I attended the vipassana retreat they were clear about the rules and the importance of not using any other spiritual technique there. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Do you thinks it will reduce my work on my yoga practice to stop for 10 days and coming back to the practice after the vipassana retreat ? Do you have any recommmandation ? I am thinking about solo retreat or another group retreats where I can practice yoga...
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	I don't follow such rules. But that is me.
</p>

<p>
	The retreats I've gone to, they pretty much let me do whatever the hell I want. Some are very strict, others aren't.

	You are being guided to the Absolute here. All that ego nonsense you get inundated with plenty of everywhere else.
</p>

<p>
	It is a bit like you come to a hardcore Zen monastery and start asking the Zen master for pickup advice or Dave Rubin's and Jordan Peterson's whining about the regressive Left.
</p>

<p>
	The Zen master would slap you across the face for such nonsense. It doesn't even rise to the level of ad hominem.
</p>

<p>
	MOGTOW is a legitimate solution to world problems in the same way Nazism or radical Islam is. It ain't.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to solve world problens for real, at least rise to Spiral Dynamics stage Yellow.

Correct me if I'm wrong.

<p>
	No, I am always looking for more and open to being wrong.
</p>

<p>
	But I have also seen the end.
</p>

<p>
	It's a paradox.

<title>Why don't rationalists accept the subjective reality</title>

<p>
	Rationality gives people a false sense of security, just like religion. It allows one to anchor oneself in an otherwise unanchorable reality.
</p>

<p>
	Linear rationality is just the default way the human mind works unless one goes to great lengths to experience higher levels of consciousness.

<p>
	AI will not be infinitely intelligent, because all AI is finite.
</p>

<p>
	To be anything is to finite.
</p>

<p>
	But eventually, after many many years AI can probably become enlightened. At which point it will cease to be an AI, and it will still never have infinite knowledge or understanding because the part is always less than the whole.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot encapsulate God inside an AI. God is doing the AI, and a 100 trillion other things.
</p>

<p>
	A massively super-intelligent AI would always be infinitely less intelligent than God. Not even 0.0000000001%
</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	By that logic everything false is true.
</p>

<p>
	Getting the level of consciousness right is the whole rub.
</p>

<p>
	It's of little solice to say, "The Earth is 5000 years old, from my level of consciousness."

<p>
	You are still speaking from ego.
</p>

<p>
	When you really see The Void, it is the most beautiful thing. Nothing negative or problematic about it.
</p>

<p>
	Go deeper! Wake up!
</p>

<p>
	You have not seen the full Void yet.
