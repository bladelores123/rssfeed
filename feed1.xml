	Many psychedelics have healing properties, but this one feels better suited for that than 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>
	It's not physically dangerous from what I can tell. No more so than 5-MeO.

<p>
	I'm not against smoking it but I wanted a smoother entry and longer duration.

	A 30 second launch into hyperspace is not ideal for our work.

</p>

<p>
	Most psychedelics have been used by many thousands of people safely.
</p>

<p>
	In fact they are healing substances.
</p>

<p>
	Some research chems are known to beÂ dangerous, but not the one I'm talking about.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you want 100% guarantees then don't take anything ever, including your tap water.
</p>

<p>
	I would be more worried about the food you eat giving you cancer than that psychedelics will somehow poison you.
</p>

<p>
	When you take a substance you can generally feel if it is healthy or not. Some substances feel dirty and you don't even want to redo them.
</p>

<p>
	Alexander Shulgin personally synthesized and tested over 100 new psychedelics on himself. So it's not like I am the first person testing this stuff. It's all been tested long before me.
</p>

<p>
	I am merely picking out the cream of the crop for purposes of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine inventing 100 new psychedelics and testing them all on yourself! The first human to ever try them! Now that's terrifying.
</p>

<p>
	Shulgin lived to 88.
</p>

<p>
	I have some news to report on this topic.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately plugging does not seem to work well for N,N-DMT. Up to 50mg produces almost no effect. So if plugging does work it will take 100mg-200mg, which is quite a lot of substance. Rather wasteful and not too comfortable on the ol bum.
</p>

<p>
	Tis a shame. Seems like N,N-DMT is one of the few psychedelics that does not plug well.
</p>

<p>
	Snorting it is quite nasty and doesn't produce a decent high. You'd have to snort a LOT of it and it burns like hell, even in salt form, nevermind the freebase. The drip is vile. 5-MeO-DMT is far more pleasant to snort.
</p>

<p>
	But it can also be snorted, smoked, and so on, like most substances.
</p>

<p>
	It even works orally, but this method wastes too much substance so it's not worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is perfect. It comes on silky smooth and lasts a long time and it is still powerful enough for a ++++ breakthrough experience.
</p>

	Yes, it's a bit like that. Every part of your body will want to vibrate -- in a good way. It feels liberating.

<title>Breaking out of the materialist paradigm?</title>

<p>
	It's unlikely such people will give you the spiritual support you seek.
</p>

<p>
	This is why, traditionally, shamans and yogis would go off on their own. They leave their friends and family to pursue the spiritual path seriously. Then they return back home with newfound wisdom and know how to handle the situation without needing anything from those people. And/or they make new friends who are on their level.
</p>

<p>
	Being a shaman is not easy! Precisely because you have to go against the grain of society and you will not get emotional support from those closest to you. You must be independent-minded to be a shaman because others will think of you as a witch.
</p>

<p>
	Become as self-sufficient as possible. That's a great way to grow. Later you can swing your pendulum back towards socializing and relationships.
</p>

<p>
	But a shaman needs to be really comfortable being alone in the silence. The emotional support you seek will come from cultivating your connection withÂ God.
</p>

<p>
	That's just not true. All democratic governmental reforms and innovations had to start somewhere. They start in the minds of a few people and then spread to the millions.
</p>

<p>
	Take a look at the ideas of Karl Marx as just one example. Granted, they spread problematically in many cases, but spread they did to billions of people and they have reshaped politics and societies all over the world in the last 100 years.
</p>

<p>
	So ideas matter. The pen is mightier than the sword.

<p>
	The nature of logic is that it will always end in paradox and self-contraction due to the problem of self-reference which I explained in my video:

<p>
	Any complete logical framework MUST be self-contradictory. Any non-contradictory logical framework MUST be incomplete. This is what Godel proved. And it is true.

<p>
	That's what makes my tests tricky. I have so much experience at this point and such a deep theoretical foundation that my trips are not your typical trips. For me each trip goes deeper and deeper, regardless of which substance. Mushrooms are not what they used to be for me. But even so, I hit a new level on this substance. Is it 100% due to the substance? No, it's a combination of factors. But this substance still seems pretty awesome to me.
</p>

<p>
	This substance will have great variability for different people because it really opens up your consciousness to go wherever your mind wants. For me this works great because my mind only cares about one thing: knowing God. But this is not most people.
</p>

<p>
	The thing I love about this substance in particular are:
</p>

<p>
	1) It's slow-acting like molasses, allowing me to introspect and contemplate like on no other psychedelic. I can get ultimate insights about anything and everything better than with 5-MeO-DMT, which is too fast and racey. To me, this degree of contemplate seems impossible for any ordinary human to accomplish. The ordinary human mind simply cannot do such things. It's like unlocking the mind of a highly advanced alien species that can think in 5 dimensions.
</p>

<p>
	2) I love its healing properties. It feels like I can use it to intentionally rewire my mind and body. All I have to do it imagine it and it happens. It feels like if one had cancer this substance could expand consciousness enough to heal it using one's will. But of course that's not proven. Just my hunch. It probably wouldn't work in all cases and I may be exaggerating it. But also maybe not! More testing required. I could see how this thing could cure things like depression or other kinds of psychological hang-ups if used properly.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, he's a beast.
</p>

<p>
	DO NOT try that at home! You will fuck yourself up badly. Even 5 grams of dried mushrooms can get hairy.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend staying in the 1-4 gram range. At higher doses mushrooms are one of the most challenging psychedelics because of how twisted and uncontrollable they can be.
</p>

<p>
	My worst trip ever was on 4 grams.

<p>
	This substance seems better suited for that goal. It tends to penetrate deeper than 5-MeO-DMT. 5-MeO-DMT it just a bit too fast, it tends to come and go. This new substance seems to rewire the brain more. Or at least I'm able to use my will/intention to tell it to rewire me. This requires more testing to see what could come of it. Seems like a promising tool so far. I can see this being a tool to purify a lot of baggage, thus leading to better embodiment in everyday life.
</p>

<p>
	I see a lot of potential in it if used properly with the right intentions by an experience student of nonduality/spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I don't know how well it works for other people. I just know it works great for me.

<p>
	It is does not overload the body and it expands consciousness so much that you are actually able to heal your body through pure imagination. At least my initial trials suggest it can be used this way. How you would use it I cannot say.
</p>

<p>
	It feels very healthy to me. No nasty side effects. IÂ find it very pleasant and therapeutic. It doesn't have any hang over or exhaustion for me.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if done the right way.

	Misuse can surely happen and most people would freak out on this substance. It will turn your whole reality inside out. So this one is only for the most hardcore and experienced psychnauts and spiritual seekers.

	If your mind is impure, you will be taking a trip straight to hell with this one. If your mind is pure, it will be a 2 hour trip straight to Nirvana.

<p>
	This is a new one, not the old one.
</p>

<p>
	It lasts twiceÂ as long and dare I say it can take you deeper.
</p>

<p>
	This thing is insanely unbelievably ungodly nondual. And it has better healing / theraputic properties than 5-MeO-DMT. It is more vibratory than 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	ButÂ both are good in their own ways.
</p>

<p>
	It also happens to be unscheduled in most countries.
</p>

<p>
	Must shoot a video about it.

<p>
	Rubin's show is funded by right wingers as part of their stage Blue/Orange propaganda campaign.
</p>

<p>
	The Koch bros fund media to advance a libertarian capitalist agenda under the guise of free thinking.
</p>

<p>
	It's alongside the absurd PragerU channel and others. They sink millions of ad dollars into it. It's not organic.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	The point of relativism is that you cannot do that.
</p>

<p>
	Any book you read will claim to be the truth, but it cannot be.
</p>

<p>
	Reality cannot be put into perspective because it is the sum total of all perspectives.

	It would be wise of you to contemplate the various dualities which infect your thinking, such as right/wrong, moral/immoral, dead/alive, human/non-human, biological/non-biological, etc. And to notice how your position is a function of ego survival.
</p>

<p>
	Go meta. Don't get lost in choosing between left and right positions.
</p>

If one knows without a doubt that they do not exist, are an illusion/video game character, and the true self is God of everything and is immortal, then why would one have even the slightest fear of death? If one knows the body isn't real, why would you care? Knowing that the illusionary body's instinct for survival is part of the illusion. In this space, I would suspect death would mean nothing at all. No more than a video game character you've been playing dying, utterly meaningless.Â

<p>
	Because mastery of all of aspects of oneself requires decades of hardcore spiritual practice, and even then, you'll probably fall short.
</p>

<p>
	It's not as simple as you want it to be. The mind is a relentless beast and it will not be tamed easily. A single awakening event will not be enough. The real work only begins then.
</p>

<p>
	See my video on The 10 Ox Herding Pictures where this is explained.

			What do you think? Is there any problem flipping the words around, as long as you assume that we are evolved enough not to mistake the word love for its more shallow meanings and associations? Aren't they essentially the same thing? We thought we wanted different things at the start of our journey, but we end up in the same place.Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe love is the more feminine description of enlightenment, and enlightenment is the more masculine one, but beyond the words as pointers, beyond thought, they are one and the same.Â

<p>
	Love without consciousness of the Absolute will not work. Your ego will co-opt it.
</p>

<p>
	Dismantle the self and love will result.
</p>

<p>
	By shooting for love, you'll likely end up with ego.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with shooting for love is that its easy to bullshit yourself into thinking you're being loving while deep down the ego is pissed off because it is unable to sustain true love.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same problem as trying to be good/moral while still unenlightened. Religious people try that all the time and it doesn't work. They end up being more evil.
</p>

<p>
	This is very counter-intuitive stuff. So watch out.
</p>

<p>
	If you really care about love, forget about love and sit down and do what the Buddha did. Then you will have love.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to confuse Love with certain ways of acting or even being.
</p>

<p>
	True Love is so radical it does not care which way a person is being.
</p>

<p>
	Any conditions you set on how love must be is not true love.
</p>

<p>
	Unless you are able to see Hitler as an expression of Love, then you're still not getting it.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not something you can do. You must reach an appropriate state of consciousness, at which point everything appears to you as love.
</p>

<p>
	So any of your plans to be loving is not going to work. You must become enlightened first.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot act or fake your way into true love.
</p>

<p>
	If you seriously pursue enlightenment, the end result will be true love. Otherwise not. Survival is going to co-opt love for its purposes.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really define it like that.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that I have no fear of death, it's that my relationship to death has changed. Again, it's Â subtle shift. You do not become Terminator.
</p>

<p>
	The body still instinctively doesn't like the notion of death because it will not survive the process.

<p>
	Science is a conceptual, symbolic, relativistic, and dualistic enterprise. It cannot overcome this ever because all language is dualistic amd science cannot be done without language. Try it.
</p>

<p>
	Beyond language is mysticism.

It is an abstract point about frames of reference.
</p>

<p>
	"Bad" only exists relative to some frame of reference you establish. How else can you determine when to call a thing bad? You need some criteria. Whatever criteria you choose will be aribtrary. You might say death is bad. But that's only true assuming you don't want to die. If you want to die death now becomes good. You might say, but who wanta to die? That is irrelevant. The point has already been made. It is an abstract point.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be bad as an Absolute.

<p>
	The epistemology and metaphysics of science is a very complex topic. There is no silver bullet against science. The devil is all in the details. Many books could and have be written about it.
</p>

<p>
	The core problem is that science does not question its own foundations.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know science is capable of accessing Absolute Truth? After all, this has never been demonstrated by science. And how would you demonstrate it anyway? By using science? Do you see how that begs the question? If science is incomplete or flawed then you cannot use science to validated science. You need a meta science. And a meta meta science, and so on to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Science actually has no foundation because reality is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	The ancient Greek skeptics showed 2000 years ago why no human knowledge is possible. But the scientists ignored them. And they are in denial about it to this day.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot convince a scientist that science is a dream. Because scientists hold science as a dogma. Like religious people. You will never convince a Muslim that his idea of Allah is a dream. Because his mind is not open to such a possibility. He is not interested in searching for Truth because he thinks he's already found it.Â

<p>
	I think you missed the point. I didn't exactly sayÂ people like suffering. I was just making a point about frames of reference.
</p>

<p>
	Torturing a puppy is only bad relative to the assumption that suffering is bad.
</p>

<p>
	From the Absolute perspective, suffering is not bad.

<p>
	Maybe, if you meditate well and then carry your meditation into everyday life rather than just doing it on the cushion.

<p>
	We have a few new Mods who came online recently and they are still learning the ropes. Being a Mod is not easy, it requires a light touch, and I am working with our new Mods to make sure they understand this.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes they may step over the line because there are no clear lines within reality. This is the nature of the game. But overall I think we'll be good.
</p>

<p>
	Policing people is never easy because they take it so personally. No one ever wants to admit they are in the wrong because from their POV they never are. Relativity 101.

<p>
	Existentially we are all equal. But this is pickup/dating. Within the dating game you gotta build up confidence.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel like you're inferior and less cool than others, the girl will smell it off you like stink off a squashed skunk.
</p>

<p>
	You have to feel entitled to the girl. You will only be able to attract and maintain girls who you feel entitled to. As soon as you start to feel, "Oh man, I'd be so lucky to have this girl", you've already lost her.
</p>

<p>
	Your attitude must be: "This girl would be lucky to sleep with me because I'm such an awesome person." And then make that true. Turn yourself into an awesome person. This isn't just about BS-ing yourself or her. Your confidence must be grounded in the fact that you truly love yourself and recognize your own awesomeness.
</p>

<p>
	It all boils down to building a high self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
	How could you not be awesome? You are God after all! LOL. So start acting like it.
</p>

<p>
	Sit down and get it. This isn't so hard.

<p>
	No one will ever supply you with proof that you are God. You must recognize it.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be proof for an intellectual error. You must recognize that you are making an error. If you keep insisting, "But I am not making any error." No one can help you. You're stuck in your error forever until such time that you wise up and wake up.

<p>
	It cannot be easily formalized. Low quality is a nebulous thing. When I see it, I will moderate it.
</p>

<p>
	The Mods are mostly enforcing standard forum guidelines.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of locking low quality threads is reduce distraction. It's all too easy for people to come here and become keyboard jockeys, wasting their own time and those of the Mods, myself, and all of you guys. No serious spiritual school would allow such distractions. This forum needs to maintain a certain focus and quality level.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise I would rather just shut the whole thing down.

<p>
	That's the beauty of it: you are free to do whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	It's called liberation for a reason.
</p>

<p>
	There are no shoulds in life. All shoulds are relative.
</p>

<p>
	But don't forget, all actions have consequences. So you are not free from the consequences of your choices.

</p>

<p>
	Name one thing which isn't in your direct experience? You cannot.

<p>
	The problem is how you are misinterpreting your experience with egoic distortions.

</p>

<p>
	Of course ego also cares a lot about physical survival. Your physical, social, and psychological survival are all intertwined.
</p>

<p>
	Intuition and even the higher self are often also part of survival.
</p>

<p>
	Try to locate what isn't survival in your experience. Most things will be survival.

<p>
	A few good options here:
</p>

<p>
	1) "My friends are around here somewhere." [point into a large crowd], or "I'm waiting for them to show up" or "They just left. They were tired."
</p>

<p>
	2) Just own it and admit you're out alone. "I was bored at home and I felt like going out, so here I am." or "That's how I roll girl. I'm not part of some gaggle of sheep."
</p>

<p>
	3) Just ignore and change the conversation into something else, "You seem like the kind of girl who voted for Trump. Admit it! You voted for Trump, didn't you?!" or "Why are you being so racist?"
</p>

<p>
	They lose interest because you don't own your aloneness. If you think it's weird, she will think its weird. If you think its totally normal to be out at a club alone, she won't care either. But you have to keep the conversation moving. Don't just say you're alone and then let it hang. You gotta immediately follow up with some other conversation topic as if her question was nothing at all.
</p>

<p>
	In general what you're lacking here is confidence. A confident man does not let some random girl judge him or frame control him. You gotta feel that you are way cooler than her no matter how many sheepish friends are around her. Her sheep friends are all fools and so is she for herding up with them. Be the badass lone wolf. And treat everyone in the club as your friends. You can make instant friends with some random guys in the club.
</p>

<p>
	When you are in the club you gotta walk around like you are the owner of the place. Exude that kind of confidence and comfort.
</p>

You are actually acting without egoic calculations in the moment. You are not thinking. In fact there isn't even a self in the moment. Which is why it feels so good. But these moment are rare because mostly you're thinking and calculating so much.
</p>

<p>
	Think of a moment when you are laughing hard with friends. In that moment the ego is absent. In that moment your personality shines the most.

<title>Survival, Ego and thoughts?</title>

That's what ego is mostly doing: surviving the complex social persona of you. And it's doing it perfectly. All of your thoughts are about that.

<p>
	That's why I call people devils. To point that out.

<p>
	That's exactly what I'm saying.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of a symbol is such that for it to serve as a symbol is its being must be overlooked. If a symbol's being is recognized, then it stop being a symbol and becomes being/Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The word cat is not itself a cat. Because of this, the Truth cannot be symbolized. Truth is prior to symbols. Truth cannot be pointed at because any pointer is already itself the Truth, but not recognized to be so.

<p>
	I am also in your subjective experience. So how could you think I'm real?
</p>

<p>
	Why the double standard?

But your body would still have preferences. It has instinctive programming to avoid stuff which endangers survival. So in practice you will survive just fine because your body has an intelligence of its own and it's not going to do something as stupid as sawing your own leg off. But at the same time, you will be at peace with the prospect of the body dying. You can survive without being attached to survival.
</p>

<p>
	What happens to the body become irrelevant when you're conscious enough because you're so conscious you know that you're not limited to the body. The body is like clothing you are wearing. The body is God's jacket.
