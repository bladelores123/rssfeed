<p>
	Seems like it. Tons of people report having done so.
</p>

<p>
	Actually the "soul" is guiding your whole life. If you want to think of it that way. It is your highest self. It's the thing which compels you to pursue spirituality and reunite with God. Without that you'd never awaken. Which is why most people never awaken: their souls are too crude and unevolved.
</p>

<p>
	At least that's the theory if you want to buy into reincarnation.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most compelling reasons for buying into reincarnation is that it explains why people have such different inclinations and attunement for spiritual work. This cannot be explained through genetics or upbringing alone. It's obvious that some people are MUCH more spiritually attuned than others from birth. The best explanation for this is past lives.
</p>

<p>
	The souls of the majority of mankind are quiet crude. Which explains why mankind is in such a big mess.
</p>

<p>
	We are NOT all the same. If you've ever wondered why you don't fit in and how other people could be so dull, materialistic, and shallow, well, here's your answer. Most folks need to live through many more lifetimes before they learn their lesson. One lifetime is just not enough.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possibility that the reason you're able to do this work at all is because you've already lived through 300 lifetimes of total barbarism and stupidity. Imagine if you were Stalin in a past life. LOL.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I prefer the Kriya yoga which I have discussed at length on this forum. I think it's more direct.
</p>

<p>
	But I also think many of you could benefit a lot from hatha yoga. But I hold Kriya yoga as far more important than hatha.
</p>

<p>
	Again, these are just my opinions. Form your own opinions through experimentation.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Except there is a common through-line between dreams. Your psyche is uniquely your psyche. Dreams ARE connected to your psyche. You often have repeating dreams and you dream about stuff which is related to your life experiences, although often in very loose ways. You work stuff out in your dreams. This is actually directly analogous to how reincarnation could work. There is a deeper structure which unifies all your lifetimes. This structure would be called the soul. It is like the mothership which sends down many probes to a new planet. Destruction of any probe does not harm the mothership. The mothership collects all the lessons of each dead probe and visits many different planets. The mothership itself could of course also be destroyed but that's another matter. The mothership is far more conscious and capable than any of its probes.

	We are studying dynamics in this work which are very challenging to transcend.

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	You guys are totally underestimating how deep survival goes! Stop thinking of survival as the physical preservation of your body. It is not that. Survival is about maintaining WHO YOU ARE.
</p>

<p>
	You are not a survival failure. You are maintaining WHO YOU ARE perfectly. Such that you even refuse to admit that what you're doing is survival.
</p>

<p>
	If WHO YOU ARE is an idiot, for example, then you spend a lot of time and energy preserving that way of life. You are playing an idiot perfectly in that case. You structure your entire way of life such that you can keep being an idiot. And any attempt to stop that will be perceived by you as death. It does not matter that being an idiot might be harmful to your physical survival. You might even walk off a cliff. But you'll still be an idiot at your moment of death, which is precisely what you wanted.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you do is about maintaining WHO YOU THINK YOU ARE. If you think you're a bird, you might jump off a cliff and flaps your arms. It does not matter that you fall to your death. As long as you keep thinking you're a bird. Right before you hit the ground your mind will rationalize it all away as, "Well, I must be one of those non-flying birds, like a ostrich."
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The problem with the "leaving a note" approach is that if you die and you have a choice to reincarnate as whatever you want, your perspective will be so much broader at that point after death that you will not care about honoring any note you left behind. You might reincarnate on some other planet in some other universe as some non-human being. Reincarnating just for the sake of demonstrating reincarnation to other humans is a really silly game. That is not the purpose of reincarnation.

<p>
	There are valuable lessons to be learned from Spiral Dynamics stage Purple. That's where many indigenous shamans are at.
</p>

<p>
	But also don't confuse stage Purple shamans with Turquoise sages. That would be a big mistake. Shamans are still missing a lot of development even though they can be quite high in spiritual development. But spiritual development is not the only important line of development.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why we hear about a lot of shamans who abuse their followers.
</p>

<p>
	A shaman will be ethnocentric and unable to see outside of his culture & traditions. A shaman will also have a rather superstitious worldview which does not accord with science or reason. This is okay, but also limited and partial.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Listening to music is very much a survival strategy for most people.
</p>

<p>
	The types of music you select and why you listen to in the first place is about who you identify yourself to be, and maintaining that. Music is like a drug that puts the ego in a good mood. How many times have you used music to boost your state and make yourself feel better when you're down? How many times have you used music to get laid? How many times have you used music to drown out annoying noise or relieve boredom? How many times have you used music to facilitate bonding with other people?
</p>

<p>
	None of your enjoyments are innocent. They're all part of a larger survival strategy.
</p>

Rather focus on observing your survival without jumping to conclusions.
</p>

<p>
	This is careful work which must be done. Not just talked about or some conclusions reached. Your conclusions do not matter much. What matters is your ability to be conscious of this stuff on a minute-by-minute basis.

<p>
	A lot of shamans have a low level of cognitive developmemt: pre-rational magical.
</p>

<p>
	They can still be very wise, but it is not the highest levels of spiritual attainment and they will be dysfunctional in many ways. They don't have a global holisitic perspective.

<p>
	You can find dirt on any person.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to look at the totality of a person's life.
</p>

<p>
	Instead of listening to others critiques. Go read Gandhi's biography.
</p>

<p>
	Overall what Gandhi accomplished was amazing, regardless of whatever flaws you might dig up.
</p>

<p>
	You can find a lot of dirt on Osho especially. He has no business judging Gandhi.

<title>How do I escalate physical touch with a girl?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/35181-how-do-i-escalate-physical-touch-with-a-girl/?do=findComment&amp;comment=432086</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I consider smooth physical escalation a cornerstone of good dating technique. You can get ridiculously good at it and girls love it.
</p>

<p>
	Entire manuals have been written on it. Search for "kino escalation". This is one part of the Mystery Method which was actually quite good and practical.
</p>

<p>
	The rule of thumb is, you start to physically touch her within seconds of meeting her. During the day time physical escalation needs to be very mild. But during night time, like at bars and clubs, it can be very heavy.
</p>

<p>
	It needs to be very natural, which means you need to feel that it's natural for her to feel that it's natural.
</p>

<p>
	Start with non-erotic areas like hand, arm, shoulder. Then move to hug. Then holding hands. Then playing with and rubbing various parts of her body. Make it as casual and playful as possible.
</p>

<p>
	So typically you shake her hand as soon as you meet her. Then you might pat her on the shoulder. Then you might take her hand in your hand and immediately throw it away. Then you might get real close to her body and immediately step back. Then you might take her hand and examine her bracelet, ring, or watch. Then you might tell her to give you a hug. Then you might hold her hand as she walks with you. Then you might put your hands around her waist as you square up to her. Then you might gently run your finger along her jaw line. Then a very short kiss, no tongue. Then you might rub her hips. Then you might pull her into your chest. Then you might squeeze or spank her butt in a playful way. Then you might fondle her tits over her clothes. Then you might breathe on her neck. Then you might gently bite her neck. Then you might run your hands through her hair, gently grabbing and pulling it. And by this point you need to isolate her to a private location for heavy makeout, foreplay, and sex.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to get comfortable doing all this is to go out to rowdy nightclubs and open every girl with physical openers and practice escalating as quickly as possible until she pushes you way. You'll be amazing how far you can get how quickly. Try even going for an instant makeout. All of this builds your comfort level and confidence such that later you can escalate smoothly on any girl in any situation and it will feel natural to her.
</p>

<p>
	She does not have to be drunk for any of this. But obviously if alcohol is involved you can get away with a lot more a lot faster. Mostly she doesn't even need to drink the alcohol. All that's required is that you're in a social space where such things are seen as normal. Whatever you do needs to fit the social situation you're in. At bars and clubs this kind of heavy physicality is totally normal. Obviously not at the mall during day time. There you play it more chill. Although I've met a guy who would hit on women at the mall and have sex with them in that very same mall! LOL! You'll be amazed at what you can get away with when you're smooth and confident.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously for any of this to work she has to show some attraction to you. Although the initial few steps of physical escalation require no attraction. Touching any erotic areas requires a degree of attraction.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to tell if a girl is attracted to you is by looking in her eyes. Does she look into your eyes and hold contact? Does she follow your lead and listen to your words? Then she's attracted. If she's looking away from you a lot, she's not attracted. You need to capture her attention with charm, humor, and confidence.
</p>

<p>
	This is a very tricky and complex topic.
</p>

<p>
	For now, the best thing you can do is carefully study your own survival in action. Don't worry to much about how to stop it or what it will ulitmately be like.
</p>

<p>
	Study it first. Awareness alone is curative.
</p>

<p>
	So long as you are a human you cannot ignore survival. Even enlightened masters must worry about food and water. To be alive is to survive. But you can make your survival much more conscious.
</p>

<title>Can 5 meo dmt be a traumatic experience too?</title>

<p>
	Yes, it can certainly be truamatic. Not the coming back part but the exploding into infinity part.
</p>

<p>
	If all of God was revealed to you in one minute, you would be so horrified you would curl up into a little ball in the corner of the room.
</p>

<p>
	That's how BIG and awesome God is. So gradual exposure is required. It's like looking at the sun. It's radiance is too great for mere mortals. You take short little peaks at it.
</p>

Nothing wrong with that.
</p>

<p>
	Just remember that once you meet the Buddha you must kill him.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with all religious teachings is that the imagery of the teaching itself becomes the final cord which must be cut for final liberation.
</p>

<p>
	For a Christian, the final obstacle will be to throw away her notion of God and Christ -- to finally realize the actual God. Only after this final step will you become a true Christian in the way Jesus wanted.

			I'm interested in this too Leo. It's like I've done things backwards. I started deconstructing my self image 16 years ago, before I had constructed a healthy ego... This led to mental illness. I've now had enlightenment experiences, yet I have never even tried to create a healthy self image, so have basically lived without an identity for the past 16 years. I'm now 32. Would you suggest that I attempt to create some sort of identity now, or just continue bringing the ox back home? Thanks. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I would bet you already many kinds of identity. So you don't need to create it.
</p>

<p>
	But what you could do is self-esteem work, shadow work, and various forms of therapy or basic self-help to make your identity less neurotic and more wholesome.
</p>

<p>
	Many books exists on these topics. Go to a book store and explore their self-help section.

	God's paradise is a trillion times greater than the hell that you imagined above as paradise.

	God's paradise is so infinitely good that it allows you to create your own hell inside it. Which you have just done unwittingly.

	No one can really stop you from self-actualizing. Not even if you're put into a jail cell. In fact, being in a jail cell is a good place to do serious work.
</p>

<p>
	You can go to a library or school and use their computers. You can meditate outdoors in a park or forest. You can contemplate in your room or at a cafe. You can even meditate in the bathroom. Make a hot bath and meditate in it for 1 hr.
</p>

<p>
	You can download all my audios and put them all on one iPod and listen anytime you want while people think you're listening to music.
</p>

<p>
	You can have all the theory you could listen to in 10 lifetimes on a single iPod. Not just my theory, anyone's theory.
</p>

	I have about 400 GB of theory on my phone and another 5-10 TB on my PC. You can even listen to it in the shower like I do.

	Let it all go. Throw it all away. Deconstruct yourself until there's nothing left to cling to. That is the truest spirituality.

<p>
	Like I said, this is where it gets mindfucky: there both is and isn't, depending on how you look at it.
</p>

<p>
	Even the deepest awakening is still not total. I don't think that's possible in human form. Human form is designed to be limited. We are lucky that being conscious of infinity is even possible for such chimps as us. If you were born a donkey you would have no such luxury.

<p>
	This is where it gets really mindfucky.
</p>

<p>
	You can be fully awake, but your consciousness will still not be total in the sense that there will many aspects of the physical world which you aren't accessing.
</p>

<p>
	You can be fully conscious of infinity, yet still not know what your neighbor had for lunch.
</p>

<p>
	To be human is to have certain limitations. Once your body dies, then I assume those limits will be released.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bit a mathematician can know what a prime number is, but still not know what the one millionth prime number is. To understand primes does not mean you have to know every single prime individually.
</p>

<p>
	For example I can know that I am you without even knowing what you look like.
</p>

<p>
	Firstly that's untrue. A lot of Blue and Orange people follow me for example.
</p>

<p>
	You can train yourself to become a Spiral Wizard and bridge builder.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, demonstration is more important than preaching. Look at Gandhi, Buddha, Jesus, MLK, etc. They helped stage Blue and lower people.
</p>

<p>
	Do not wait for people to rise to your level, lead them there.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to lead everyone. Lead those who will listen. At least 25% of people will listen with an open mind. Learn to appeal to peoples inner goodness, love, and higher self. Inspire them!

<title>What Is The Point Of Life? // Lessons and Questions</title>

<p>
	Be careful holding nirvana as a separate from form or samsara. From God's POV they are identical. So if you imagine nirvana as a formless realm of pure emptiness and bliss, that is true, but that is also incomplete. That's only one side of the coin. The other side is manifest relative reality.
</p>

<p>
	So to say that "God gets bored" simply means: a state of pure formlessness is unstable. It cannot stay that way because it bursts forth with infinite creative force. It must explode into infinite manifestation.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all of this happens instantly, prior to time. Is already is, always was, and always will be. That is true, full, nondual Nirvana: formless and formed forever as one.

<p>
	It's smart to improve one's self-image first before trying to totally transcend it.
</p>

<p>
	Most of you guys would benefit from some basic self-esteem and self-image work.
</p>

<p>
	A weak self-image is too insecure to allow itself to be transcended.
</p>

<p>
	Transcending the self-image is the highest stage of Maslow's pyramid.

<p>
	Newton was a wise guy.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to abandon science. What we are doing here is science of the highest order: the science of self, mind, life, and God.
</p>

<p>
	Just breathe the spirit back into orthodox science. If people like you don't, who will?
</p>

<p>
	If Newton were alive today he would be doing just that.
</p>

<p>
	Be the change you wish to see.

<p>
	To have no self-image at all is the highest level of awakening. You then become God.
</p>

<p>
	God is what remains after the self-image is bypassed/transcended.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to transcend the self-image in one go. It takes years of deconstruction work and multiple awakenings.

<title>Confusion “conceptual” vs. “Physical” limitation consciousness</title>

<p>
	The duality between physical and conceptual must of course collapse.
</p>

<p>
	You are not looking through your eyes. That you doesn't exist at all. Emptiness imagines there is a you who is looking through some eyes.
</p>

<p>
	There is a limit to how far you can look, feel, think only given your present state of consciousness. In higher states of consciousness (like on a psychedelic) it is possible to see, feel, and think unlimited and "impossible" things.

	For example, it's possible to become the entire universe or see aliens from another universe and talk with them telepathically. These occurances are more real, not less real, than your current physical reality.

<p>
	Self-image = ego
</p>

<p>
	You can do/have whatever you want. Just understand that there will be natural consequences.
</p>

<p>
	Ego = suffering

	Survival is a complex affair, often selfish as well as symbiotic. You can't be totally selfish because in the end selfish and selfless are one.

			One thing that I don’t understand about ‘helping people awaken’ is the fact that most people don’t want to awaken. I don’t very often see people asking me “please help me become enlightened” or “please help me reach stage turquoise”. If that were the case, I would gladly give them all my support.

<p>
	People are like children and sheep, what they want is not good for them and they have no idea what they really want.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't mean you force them into anything, this means they require conscious leadership. Shows them what they are missing. Show them who they can be. Wake them up to their own highest possibilities.
</p>

<p>
	Without conscious leadership the world will destroy itself.

<p>
	Every seriously awake person understands he/she is God. They just may not put it in those words because they know most people will balk at that. So instead they try to quietly guide to realize it for yourself without explicitly saying it to your face, because they know this triggers the ego.
</p>

<p>
	It's called spirituality for a reason. Don't overlook the obvious.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way to escape the fact that you are God. This is the very heart of awakening. Do not try to turn God into some secular materialist thing. It actually is God, not anything else. This must be faced head on. Accepting yourself as God is an important aspect of this work because people are so in denial about it. You can't be embody God so long as you're in denial that you are God. It's the ego which is denying it.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need anyone. You don't need a shaman. You ARE the shaman. You ARE GOD! And all the answers are inside of you.
</p>

<p>
	You will never grow faster or deeper than doing a solo retreat. Here is where you truly confront yourself. This is how all the most advanced yogis do it.
</p>

<p>
	Want to grow more in 1 month than you have in 10 years? Take 30 days off for a solo retreat. Add in psychedelics and BAM! There is no faster way to grow yourself.

			Specifically because of this is why it's important to not throw away all of the dualistic definitions when dealing with those societies and cultures. Speaking in nondual terms to dualistic minds is like speaking Latin to a Korean. It's a completely different language that sounds like hokey to those who don't understand it.

<p>
	We are not saying to do away with all dualistic notions. Language is always dualistic so that would not even be possible.
</p>

<p>
	What we are saying is to be more conscious of the socially constructed nature of human institutions and culture.

<p>
	If you care about human life, your worldview must be GLOBAL! Mankind's greatest challenges are GLOBAL. This cannot be resolved by just focusing on your local community. That's what got us into so much trouble that we're in today.

	Then when the government goes to hell, don't be surprised and don't complain. Cause that's what such irresponsibility creates.
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem here is, you take good government for granted. If you spent a year in Iraq you'd really be able to appreciate the importance of good government.

<p>
	In practice, no you can't, because we live in a globalized world. You cannot just build a wall between your community and the outside world. Because fundamentally everything is interconnected. Eventually your commune would die out or become a cancer.
</p>

<p>
	The issue of running a good society is very complex. You cannot it do it in isolation, or by sticking your head in the sand, or by ignoring issues of mass scale. Whatever solutions you imagine must work at the scale of 100s of millions of people AT LEAST, and even at the scale of 7 billion. Otherwise you're not actually addressing the deepest issues, you're just offloading them on someone else to solve.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can create a small commune of millionaires who live on a golf course in a gated community with security guards. But this is all made possible by the larger society which maintains the police, military, legal system, monetary system, education system, fire department, important regulations, food inspections, vaccinations, environmental protections, trade treaties, taxation, nuclear weapons, telecommunications, immigration, airports, etc, etc. Your little commune could not exist without all that as supporting infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
	Just as an example of how everything is interconnected: let's say you build your perfect little commune on a tropical island. Everything is going great until some large corporation decides to use your island chain as nuclear dump site. A giant oil tanker full of nuclear waste material come and dumps 100 tons of radioactive material on a neighboring island. This material leeches into the water and gives 70% of the people on your island cancer which you cannot cure without flying back to the mainland. But to cure your cancer requires you pay $100,000 in medical bills which you cannot afford because you lived on a remote island with no major economy. You have no way to stop this from happening because your island is without any political power. So your commune very soon dies.

			We could go back to something like what America was when the Native Americans lived here with no concepts of land ownership. The fictions of wealth, expensive properties and buildings are what make that impossible. An enlightened society would resemble what America was before Columbus, but without the disconnection and warfare caused by tribalism.

<p>
	I am not saying that we need to eliminate all social constructions. Social constructions are necessary and useful. We just need to be conscious and honest that they are social constructions, not objective things. And we need to not get out identities attached to them.
</p>

<p>
	300 million people can never go back to living in a pre-Columbus society. This is not possible due to problems of scale and technological and cultural evolution. You cannot put the genie back in the bottle. 300 million people requires SERIOUS bureaucracy to manage. Bureaucracy itself is not the problem. The problem is corruption in the bureaucracy, which can and must be eliminated.
</p>

<p>
	The invention of modern bureaucracy is a miracle greater than electricity. Without it your life would be so awful it would hardly be worth living. People take all this for granted.

<p>
	1-2g is good for that.
</p>

<p>
	Just set a genuine intention to know. Frame your question and ask it in your mind a bunch of times before the trip. Then let the mushrooms show you. They may at first show you other stuff before they finally show you want you ultimately want. Sometimes to get what you ultimately want you must go through a few detours and work out some kinks in yourself.

<p>
	Yes, you DO have to get involved in politics. But not from a position of ego.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying you should hate your country or deny whatever country you live in. Just don't confuse it with who/what you are. America is a very small part of God's creation, and really, it's a creation of your mind. God does not know or see any America.
</p>

<p>
	All that's being said here is to be conscious of the socially constructed nature of all these social constructs like money, political parties, nation states, races, genders, etc. Do not confuse any of that stuff with Truth or with yourself. Do not take any of it personally. Use it and enjoy it, but don't attach to it.

<p>
	It's only true in your mind. "America" is something you invented. If you think you're "an American" you invented that. It's very important to be conscious of that.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a bunch of people get together and say that "this is America" doesn't make it so. It's a collective hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, no two people in the world agree on what "America" even means. Everyone has their own ideas about what America is and ought to be. Some people believe America is "The Great Satan". And they're not entirely wrong. If Americans are not devils, who is?

			Would you say that traditional techniques (such as vipassana) were developed for highly functional people? (that's something I've been wondering about for a long time now)

<p>
	Well, most of the best meditation techniques were developed by the most advanced sages of mankind. They were exceptionally gifted and highly functional (for the most part).
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean that a dysfunctional person can't benefit from Vipasanna. That would be a misguided conclusion.

			Do you have any insight as to how people starting from less functional places (such as your usual anxiety and depressive disorders, having lived through trauma, etc., or just motivated by lack) should approach the field differently?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yeah, lots could be said about that. Books could be written about that, and have. There are many books written by people who went through long periods of recovery and healing before ultimately awakening.
</p>

<p>
	I would definitely suggest doing more basic self-help work. Tackling advanced metaphysical topics for dysfunctional people wouldn't be too effective I imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Going from dysfunctional to functional is actually a very good approach. Traditionally, dysfunctional people were not even allowed to get initiated into yoga, for example, because you need to have your shit together to do yoga properly. There are qualifications for serious spiritual seekers for good reason. Spirituality is not for slobs and rubes. Spirituality requires high maturity and innate wisdom. Otherwise it get corrupted into evil.
</p>

<p>
	But this doesn't mean you can't have some kind of mild spiritual practice while you're doing basic self-help / healing. You can. Just don't expect it to take to the highest levels of insight.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, developing a spiritual connection is a big part of the answer. But also developing that connection properly is not easy. It requires serious commitment and work. Which many dysfunctional people are unable to muster. But again, don't take this on as a limiting belief. No one is stopping you but yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps the biggest obstacle for a dysfunctional person is that he/she will simply be unable to tolerate the stark brutality of the Truth which spirituality reveals. Which is why they are dysfunctional in the first place. Weak people cannot handle hearing the Truth. They have all sorts of twisted defense mechanisms to deny it all day long.
</p>

<p>
	Developing a genuine desire for raw truth is essential to spiritual work.

<title>Is Nationalism bad?</title>

<p>
	The key point is that you realize that there is no boundary whatsoever between you and all other sentient beings. And that all identities are fabrications for purposes of survival.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you're an American, that's something you fabricated to make yourself feel good. It's not true and it's an unconscious survival function.
</p>

<p>
	This becomes very problematic when people refuse to admit that they fabricate such identities. Which of course all nationalists will refuse to admit. The whole point is to ground the ego in that identity in order to deny Emptiness.

<p>
	The avoidance of suffering is a problematic source of motivation because avoidance of suffering rarely leads to Truth. It can, but 99% of the time it leads to various forms of devilry and delusion. Because there are so many ways to mollify the suffering with illusion. And the desire to escape suffering itself ends up creating the most suffering. What is it that wants to escape suffering? Mostly ego. And of course it doesn't really want Truth, it merely wants pleasure. And as soon as your suffering is mitigated, you stop caring about Truth. That's the problem with negative motivation. It produces yo-yo effects. The more your suffering is reduced the less you care about Truth. Which means you're unlikely to ever reach it. Whereas if your whole motivation was Truth, you'd reach it very quickly.
</p>

<p>
	Wanting the Truth is the highest kind of motivation for this work. The highest masters didn't get that way to avoid suffering. They got that way because the loved and valued Truth so highly they were will willing to incur enormous suffering to reach it. But of course this kind of motivation is rare.
</p>

<p>
	As the proverb goes: a fool will learn no other way than through suffering. Which means the wise aren't motivated that way.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well of course I am always under the influence of ego-mind. It's a matter of being aware of it and not letting it get out of hand.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I can get into ego traps, but I'm generally aware enough to realize when it is happening, even if I cannot immediately stop it, at least I know what is happening, whereas many people do not. And I'm very careful when it comes to epistemic traps.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem is when people haven't studied enough high quality sources to even know which traps exist. Then they can get really off track. Most people who do spirituality do not study nearly enough, so they are ripe for traps. They think they can just wing their way through this, and of course they can't. This field is far to tricky and subtle to wing it.
</p>

<p>
	It's a miracle that any Buddhas make it at all.
</p>

<p>
	Many people get into spirituality due to intense suffering. That is very common.
</p>

<p>
	My point is though, that is not the only way to get into spirituality. That's not why I do spirituality for example. I do it to seek Truth, wisdom, and understanding. My point is, I want this path to be open to people who just want truth for truth's sake, not just because they seek to escape suffering.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that one must be deeply dysfunctional to get into spirituality is not a good one to spread. Spirituality is for highly functional people (and also dysfunctional ones).
</p>

			I will say one last thing ok. People don't just end up on this site, or being aware of nonduality without having some kind of mental or physical ailment (something wrong with them). It's just an observation of mine...just a very consistent one. Sometimes it's a personality disorder, sometimes it's someone who has massive depression, maybe someone who's just a real loser or anything else that causes you pain. The kind of suffering that is usually constant (every day). It might even be something as small as not being good looking and having low self esteem or something.

<p>
	Do not make such generalizations.
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally this work is not about avoiding suffering, it is about a desire for the deepest truth, wisdom, and love. Not because you lack or suffer but because you desire it.
</p>

<p>
	Lack is a poor motivation source.

<p>
	It's important to distinguish learning facts and memorizing stuff from learning wisdom and core principles.
</p>

<p>
	These are two very different pursuits.
</p>

<p>
	Learning facts and memorizing stuff is rather pointless and can even be counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	Wisdom, however, is never forgotten. Deep understanding is permanent.
