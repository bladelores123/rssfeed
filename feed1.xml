<p>
	I don't agree with that. I don't see evidence we are going backwards.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that going forwards is never a straight line. It's always been 2 steps forward, 1 step back.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of smooth-brained folks interpret the 1 step back as the end of the world, when really it's all part of going forward.
</p>

<p>
	Forward is a counter-intuitive thing.
</p>

<p>
	That's a hallmark of conservative ideology. Its always got a romanticized view of history. The past is always mythologized and whitewashed in grossly unrealistic and ahistorical ways. Conservatism is inherently ahistorical.
</p>

<p>
	As if 1980's, or 1970's, or 1960's, or 1950's America was ever so great. It never was. There were riots and protests and murders and wars in all those eras. And all the laws were far inferior to what they are today. But conservatives love to tell themselves that those were the good ol' days -- when lynching a blackie for looking at a white woman wasn't even considered a crime by the local sheriff.

<p>
	I was strictly a designer. Although when I worked on my own projects I would do art and coding as well.
</p>

<p>
	CD Projekt Red actually emailed me about 8 years ago asking me to join them on Witcher 3's development. But I said no because I was starting Actualized. If I had said yes, I would probably be working on Cyberpunk right now. But I have zero interest in working for anyone but myself, and certainly not in the giant meatgrinder of AAA development.

<p>
	Basically yes, although there was still content in my experience, but it was made irrelevant by my overwhelming concentration on pure Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	And moreover, all content IS Nothing.
</p>

<p>
	There really is no difference between content and no content.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want a pure no-content experience, that's certainly possible. It's not strictly necessary, but possible. You can become pure Consciousness with no content. This is a specific type of samadhi.

<title>Is &quot;The Great Awakening&quot; Real?</title>

<p>
	Nah.... I don't buy it.
</p>

<p>
	There is a Green awakening happening, and a huge backlash to that. But there is no Turquoise level awakening happening. Less than 0.1% of the world is at the Unitive stage of ego development and I don't see that number shifting significantly in our lifetimes.
</p>

<p>
	There will be a big Green awakening over our lifetimes though as stage Blue and Orange become increasingly morally bankrupt and outdated.
</p>

<p>
	The number of people actually grasping nonduality is pitifully low, and that will not change without better government infrastructure, massive education reform, serious redistribution of wealth, and some kind of serious checks on capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that most of the planet is stuck in stage Blue, fighting tooth and nail to get to Orange. And it will be that way for decades to come.
</p>

<p>
	I bet it will probably get a 9/10 or 10/10 rating and sell something like 30+ million copies. Unless it turns out to be turd.
</p>

<p>
	I think they've been developing it so long because they know if they can hit a 9/10 rating they will earn a billion dollars off this title. So it's really in their benefit to make it good.
</p>

<p>
	If it matches the quality of Witch 3, they will earn a billion dollars.

Their top talent will burn out and leave and CD Projekt Red will turn into EA, Blizzard, Bethesda, Bioware. That's what always happens. The more success they get, the more money they earn, the bigger their hits, the more corrupt and heartless they become.
</p>

<p>
	Once you reach that level of success and size, it all becomes a corporate machine and it will never be about the art.
</p>

<p>
	AAA game development is basically unsustainable from a creative/artistic POV. It's fucking meatgrinder.

I suppose you can argue that doing pickup is an investment into yourself, but I imagine if you are really serious about it it can get really expensive. Especially if you live in LV, go out every weekend, probably end up buying some girls drinks, taking some girls out on dates. I mean jeez, that can add up quick. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Actually, Vegas is a super affordable place to live. If you are a local here, every club has free entry for locals on Sundays-Thursdays. Parking used to be free, now it's like $10. Drinks are $18 here, but I have never bought a girl a drink in my life and have no intention of starting. Dates can be super cheap. A date for me is a $5 coffee or ice cream.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to hit up the hottest clubs in the world on Fri/Sat, that will cost you $40/night. But the clubs in Vegas are off the hook amazing. You've never seen so many hot girls in your life. $40/night is worth it if you're serious about developing your skills and you have a decent salary.
</p>

<p>
	If you are clever, you can do pickup very cheap or even free. Depends a lot on location. Drinks in Austin, TX are like $3 and none of the bars have cover. Over my entire time in pickup I spent little money. Most of my money was spent simply on traveling to the best cities. And once I paid $2000 for a bootcamp.

			I feel like if you have already achieved financial freedom and are comfortable in life, then it could be worth it. I would love to spend some time trying to get better with girls but I'm so occupied trying to figure out what in hell I'm going to do to avoid the dreaded 9-5 and spending lots of time reading, watching videos, and thinking. Maybe that's just an excuse. It's definitely a department I need to work on, but just not a priority at the moment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You don't need total financial freedom to do pickup. Most of the guys who I met in pickup were not financially free. They had normal 9-5 jobs and gamed at night or on the weekends.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest challenge is not money, it's time and energy. Pickup eats up a ton of time and energy. But still guys are able to do it while holding down regular jobs. I have met accountants, pilots, engineers, doctors, dentists, salesmen, etc. who did serious pickup.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I took a lot of time off work/biz to invest into pickup, and it was worth it. Of course I could only do that because I already was financially independent. But don't let this be a limiting belief. You don't have to be. But also, why not do both?!

<p>
	Well, of course Trump is an elite, but his supporters are too dumb to see that.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there is no elite conspiracy. Elites are just wealthy and powerful people acting out their self-agenda, as all people are. And they often have different agendas. Elites fight with elites all the time.

<p>
	"War criminal" is a dumb label. It is meaningless when applied to presidents and heads of state. Leaders of giant countries and militaries are forced to make combat decisions that involve the loss of thousands of lives. It is part of their job description.

<p>
	Trump is worse than Biden and Obama. Trump does more drone strikes than Obama.

	See, this is why such a label is dumb. You use it to create a gross false equivalency.

<p>
	It's like saying, "What's the difference between going bowling with my next door neighbor, Jim, who kills chickens to feed his family, and going bowling with Charles Manson? They're both killers. So I'll just go with Manson since he's already in the car and ready to drive."
</p>

<p>
	You lack imagination to see just how dangerous Trump's decisions can be if he was presented with a serious military emergency. It's very much possible that Trump's idiocy and narcissism could kill 1 million or 10 million lives.

<p>
	As the propaganda and culture war against stage Green heats up, people get polarized and are forced to take sides. Thus people like Hulse take the side of Blue/Orange vs Green in the culture wars, which can seem like regression (or it may be actual regression as their minds are slowly rotted away by right-wing propaganda).
</p>

<p>
	As the center of gravity of American culture shifts to solid Green, many people will dig in their heels and refuse to budge. Even going so far as the pull hard in the opposite direction to the "good old days" they remember.

<p>
	By definition if you are regressing down one stage, it's unconscious. Regression IS a lapse in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	People are not choosing these things. These "choices" are simply baked into their habitual low-consciousness behaviors.

			The influential historian, who specialized in American history, and social critic, the late <strong>Christopher Lasch</strong>, in his 1996. posthumously published book ,,<strong>The Revolt of the Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy</strong>'' wrote that there was a new elite emerging in American society in the 1980's and 1990's in American society, that Trump given his familial background and livelihood revenues was a part of and still is,<em> that was so detached in the way's they earn their income, in which social circles they move and interact with and in where they live and how they live from ordinary Americans</em> <u>that Lasch called them the</u> <strong>cerebral aristocracy</strong> <u><em>of the contemporary globalized world</em> </u>and <strong>wrote</strong> <em>how they live lives so detached from regular people who live in the same country as them, that they interact and socialize only, on a deeper level, with the members of the same group as them and with international elite in other countries in limited geographical pockets and exclusive social events, that they have become so detached and wilfully oblivious to the national decay and collapse taking place in their own countries, and have at this point internalized in them as part of a normal course of happenings within the country they inhabit, there are bad times and there are good times, while not being affected it by it all themselves</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Quotes from the book:
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, The child of a materially wealthy civilization, like a child of any nouveau riche, is almost always spoilt, immodest and shameless.''</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, Their motto maximum pleasure, minimum responsibility, has brought about a demographic decline of the countries they live in.''</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, Patriotism, certainly does not accompany a high position on the scale of their values and virtues. So the following question is asked: Do they even consider themselves as other Americans, deep down? "</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, They are not on the side of their own societies, since they  fundamentally don't know it, they are on the side of global structures and cliques, in which circles they spend most of their active lives."</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			I think this a good description<em> from what part American society Trump comes from</em>, <em>about what shaped his character </em>and <em>view of other people that are not a part of the same class in society as he is</em>.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You have to be careful when framing global worldviews as some sort of evil.
</p>

<p>
	The above things you quoted are a basic trend of moving from stage Blue or Orange to Green. You develop a more global perspective.
</p>

<p>
	But that isn't even Trump's problem. Trump's problem is far below that of being some neoliberal elite. It's too heartless, narcissistic, and ignorant to be an effective neoliberal globalist type.

	Trump wasn't some hippie contentious objector. He was just too selfish to service his country.

<p>
	Shunyamurti was draft dodger. But there is a big difference between saying, "I will not fight an unjust war and protest against it's injustice" vs "I don't want to fight this war because I would rather have sex at nightclubs and make money back home".

<p>
	Existence itself is formlessness. It is definitely possible to have pure empty existence minus any forms.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing (as we use it on this forum) is not a concept, it is a direct consciousness of one's true nature.

<p>
	No. All experiences are enlightenment once you simply realize there was no one ever behind them.
</p>

<p>
	Experience isn't the problem, the only problem is that self-image which keeps feeding itself, telling itself that there is someone to whom the experiences are happening to.

<p>
	You can become conscious of Absolute Truth. This is quite an achievement. But Absolute Truth is not anywhere elsewhere but here and now. Just remove the ego sense and all will be revealed as Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not merely another experience, it's a meta thing in which you realize the true nature of all experiences.

<p>
	You can talk to them and get a feel for their worldviews.
</p>

<p>
	I've hung out with and listened to a lot of guys in the pickup community. They tend to treat rape as a joke. Some of them are actual rapists. When speaking with such guys, they clearly don't think of rape as anything wrong or harmful.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of immature guys tend to think of rape like this:
</p>

<p>
	"Well, if I got raped by a hot girl, that would be cool and I would be happy, therefore, rape isn't a big deal. Those feminist/SJW types are just making a big deal out of nothing. Besides, girls are sluts and whores anyway, so what difference does it make?"
</p>

<p>
	It's a very self-centered view of sex. Women are simply seen as convenient objects to satisfy one's own sexual needs, and then discarded. The belief is, they are all sluts anyway, so they lose nothing and they aren't really hurt.
</p>

	His draft dodging tells you everything you need to know about the kind of guy Trump is.
</p>

<p>
	The suckers are this supporters who believe he gives one shit about them or America.

<p>
	Perhaps a common mark of toxic masculinity ideology is that it interprets the term "toxic masculinity" as meaning: all masculinity is toxic. But to say that some forms of masculinity are toxic does not mean there isn't healthy masculinity.

	If you ever awaken deep enough, you will realize that the opposite pole of your own is just something you imagined in order to identify as your pole.
</p>

<p>
	If you identify as masculine, you will realize feminine is something you imagined as "not you".
</p>

<p>
	If you identify as feminine, you will realize that masculine is something you imagined as "not you".
</p>

<p>
	The Ultimate Truth is you are both, and beyond.
</p>

<p>
	Masculine and feminine identification is like a schizoid rift in the Mind of God. God is suffering from multiple personality disorder.

<p>
	Not it isn't.
</p>

<p>
	If you take a moment to contemplate this, you'll realize that "harm" is a purely relative notion. "Harm" is always defined relative to some ego's needs and desires, which are themselves relative and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	Harm is a relative, subjective, biased, egoic notion.
</p>

<p>
	YOU think rape is harmful. A rapist certainly doesn't think that. And your view has no higher epistemic position than that of a rapist in the absolute sense.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of men genuinely believe that rape is not harmful. And that is true from the POV.
</p>

<p>
	It's simple, really: pursuing women can be turned into a larger healthy self-actualization journey or it can devolve into ideology, toxic masculinity, ego-aggrandizement, and mindless pleasure seeking.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to business. Similar to psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	These things can go really well or really sour depending on what intentions you're doing them with.
</p>

<p>
	For me, pickup led to the creation of Actualized.org. For other guys it can lead to rapey type of behavior. Pickup very much magnifies your true intentions and character. If you're a scummy guy deep down, then pickup will magnify that. Much like how if you give a evil person a $10 million dollars, he will use it to do evil things. But if you give a good guy $10 million dollars, he will use it to advance mankind in some way.

	Nonsense.

<p>
	What the 2016 election clearly showed is that no elites are controlling the winners, since all the elites hated Trump and thought he would never win. Even Trump didn't think he would win!

<p>
	It's quite silly to blame the US police system on Biden. This system is so huge it is outside of any one politician's control. The 90's was a different time. Everyone was into strong policing back then. You cannot retroactively project 2020 standards on 90's politics.

<p>
	I would make the opposite point. The chances now are better than ever of a new Obama or Clinton -like, but progressive, leader to emerge. I think we'll see exactly that in the next 8 to 16 years. It will happen regardless of whether Trump wins or Biden wins. In both cases people are going to see that neither conservativism nor neoliberalism are working. And they will be eager for something new. Someone like Bernie but with a younger, more charismatic face, and a fighter.
</p>

<p>
	The function of Bernie was not to win the Presidency. The function of Bernie was to pave the way for a new, younger, charismatic progressive leader in the next 5 to 20 years.

<p>
	You might as well vote for Donald Duck.
</p>

<p>
	Co-opting the Dem party is the way to go. As AOC and the Justice Dems are doing.
</p>

<p>
	Trump too co-opted the Republican party.
</p>

<p>
	In both cases, the game consists of shifting the two mainstream parties either more left or more right. That's the whole game. Take responsibility for it. You can't be in politics while avoiding this game.
</p>

<p>
	By rejecting the game you automatically lose it.
</p>

<p>
	There is never going to be some magical "good" 3rd party which is above the fray. Such a party will never get mainstream appeal. The parties have to be dumbed down and play to the lowest common denominator so long as people are in Tier 1 stages of cognitive development. And a Tier 2 party will never win.
</p>

<p>
	At least in our lifetime. Maybe in 100 years this will start to change.

	It's flawed if you take it literally as you must be 50/50. It's wise if you understand the larger point he's trying to make.

	There is a decent chance Biden can win AZ. Which would create a bit of safe space.
</p>

<p>
	Biden can afford to lose PA as long as he wins AZ.

			Yes, but only everything that actually exists.
		</p>

		<p>
			Marlon Brando is not actually The Godfather. It's just Marlon Brando. There's no duality there, only Brando exists. Godfather is just Brando pretending. That doesn't validate the existence of The Godfather one iota, and it's not a duality or distinction that needs "collapsing" or reconciling one way or another. There never was a godfather, it was always just Marlon Brando pretending. Godfather is pure fabrication.
		</p>

		<p>
			The movie on a videotape is just videotape. There is no movie other than the videotape. No duality, no need to reconcile them. The videotape exists, the movie doesn't, except as a facade of the videotape. The movie is pure fabrication, can't possibly exist in its own right, and is thereby proof of the videotape even if nobody in the movie ever "experienced" the video tape. Nonduality refers to the videotape, not the movie. At most you could say that the movie is an expression of the videotape, and as such included in the nondual nature of the videotape.
		</p>

		<p>
			If appearance is anything, it's consciousness pretending. Sort of. Form is formless pretending. They are not identical in truth, one is a facade of the other, and only the other exists so no need to reconcile them. Relativity is the absolute pretending. Still no duality, still no actual relativity. It was always just the absolute pretending. Sort of. The absolute never actually does anything, it just imagines to be doing everything. Still no duality, still no need to reconcile.
		</p>

		<p>
			Only the absolute exists, relativity never did. Reality is not a strange loop, it only appears as a strange loop. Strange loop is the facade.
		</p>

		<p>
			Infinite regression is not the same as actual infinity. The former can't exist, the latter must exist. A strange loop is infinite regression. Relativity is infinite regression. Two hands drawing eachother is infinite regression. Escher's stairs are infinite regression. Duality is infinite regression. Infinite regression is not absolute, it is impossible. Infinity is absolute and necessary.
		</p>

		<p>
			Come on it's not that difficult...  😕 
		</p>

<p>
	No, you are still creating duality by trying to negate appearances. Appearances are absolute. If you don't get that, you ain't really awake.
</p>

<p>
	That itch on your ass -- yup, it's absolute.
</p>

<p>
	In my experience most guys who I met who are into pickup are more developed than the average person. Because pickup is emotionally difficult, those who are moderately successful at it tend to take personal development seriously.
</p>

<p>
	There tends to be a big difference between guys who keyboard jockey about pickup online, and those who actually go out every night consistently.

<p>
	Here's a pretty good analysis of how this might work.

<p>
	Although I highly doubt Biden can win Texas. That is not good assumption at all.

<p>
	Here's an interactive map you can use to make your 2020 election predictions:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.270towin.com/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.270towin.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Here are my two predictions as of Sept 1.
</p>

<p>
	Scenario #1: Biden barely squeaks out a victory, like so:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.270towin.com/maps/3XGAN" rel="external nofollow">https://www.270towin.com/maps/3XGAN</a>
</p>

<p>
	Scenario #2: Biden wins solidly if he carries Florida, like so:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.270towin.com/maps/KQVKm" rel="external nofollow">https://www.270towin.com/maps/KQVKm</a>
</p>

<p>
	I would bet more on scenario #1. Florida is not to be trusted.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Here are the most important swing state poll results:
</p>

<p>
	Wisconsin: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/wisconsin/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/wisconsin/</a>

	Georgia: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/georgia/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/georgia/</a>

	Arizona: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/arizona/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/arizona/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Florida: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/florida/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/florida/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Iowa: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/iowa/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/iowa/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Minnesota: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/minnesota/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/minnesota/</a>
</p>

<p>
	North Carolina: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/north-carolina/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/north-carolina/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Pennsylvania: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/pennsylvania/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/pennsylvania/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Texas: <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/texas/" rel="external nofollow">https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/texas/</a>
</p>

<p>
	I think Trump will win Texas, North Carolina, Ohio, and Georgia.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Make your own map and post the link here with your reasoning.

<p>
	Again, it's not about the actual sex, but about learning the skills to be a strong, attractive man. Those skills actually do create lasting fulfillment.
</p>

<p>
	And the sex doesn't have to be low quality. You will find cool girls and they can become your girlfriend which can grow into deep amazing sex.

	We need to coin a new term: Meta-cringe -- when you cringe at the ignorance displayed by others cringing at stuff because they think it is ignorant, AND at the same time you are fully conscious that your own cringe at their cringe is also ignorance on a higher level. <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

	You don't need to be a some enlightened genius to understand this. You can get this right now.
</p>

<p>
	Let's say you just had a baby and I presented you with a button to push. If you push this button, the baby will never experience fear or pain in its life. Would you push this button?
</p>

<p>
	Well, if you do, your baby will be dead within 1 year as it breaks it skull on something.
</p>

<p>
	How do you expect survival to happen if fear and pain aren't present?
</p>

<p>
	If you want an organism to stay alive for 80 years, you better program it with many fears and pains.

<p>
	If you read the comments section under my video: The Dark Side Of Mediation, you'll see a lot of ignorant people, many of them Christians, taking my points as reasons why meditation is evil or demonic.
</p>

<p>
	People have this naive notion that if meditation isn't easy, pleasant, and instantly positive, or if it creates emotional purging, then it must be evil. When in fact those negative symptoms are simply the process of the devil leaving your body. As always, the devil calls what is good, evil, and what is evil, good.

<p>
	There is value in the alpha/beta distinction in the sense that you can turn yourself into a much stronger man. Not physically stronger per se, but spiritually stronger.
</p>

<p>
	You can become a lion among men. Which is a good thing. But it must be genuine strength rooted in consciousness and Love, not some frat-boy machismo which is compensating for insecurity, fear, and lack of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Teaching men how to be strong is a great and important teaching. You just have to be careful not to turn it into toxic masculinity, which is all too easy.

<p>
	Well, actually, Trump lost the popular vote by several million. So it says more about our antiquated and anti-democratic system.
</p>

<p>
	In a proper democracy Trumpists would have no chance of holding power. Which is why they aren't strong supporters of proper democracy.
</p>

<p>
	As many dumb fucks as we have, Trump still lost the popular vote. And so did Bush.

<p>
	You can't ever denuclearize because nuclear technology is used in power plants, space travel, chemistry, mining, and many other places.

	But libertarians are not such humans because they don't believe in the collective responsibility necessary to create such a society.

<p>
	You cannot have a healthy peaceful society of 7 billion people who all act like individualists.
</p>

<p>
	That kind of attitude will result in a bloodbath.

<p>
	It is like you are trying to form a worldclass soccer team with people who are ideologically opposed to team cooperation. Effective teams require individual sacrifice for the collective.

<p>
	Nope. Winners know exactly what they want.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, they may be fooling themselves in the absolute spiritual sense, but it is possible to have a clear vision and desire in the relative domain and achieve it. Of course this has nothing to do with happiness, but that's another matter.
</p>

<p>
	How do you think Actualized.org was created?
</p>

<p>
	I knew 8 years ago exactly what I wanted it to be (in the big picture). Without that vision it would have never happened.

	Be a visionary!

<p>
	No! Libertarianism is more zero-sum survival than democracy.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to see how libertarianism works, look at the animal kingdom. It's every man for himself, raping and killing to survive. It's not peaceful at all. Peace requires monopoly of force and strong regulations.

			No. Relativity is a child's play. What I'm saying goes deeper. I'm claiming that there's only one true set of thoughts that describe the absolute truth and therefore are true. And all other sets of thoughts are false, wrong, and delusional. One set is absolutely true because it emulates the absolute truth. The remaining sets don't represent the truth, and therefore they're not true, not absolutely nor relatively. They're necessarily false.
		</p>

		<p>
			The actual bank robbery event is absolute truth. The thoughts describing it can be either true or false depending on whether they actually represent what happened or not. An apple is not a banana. An apple is an apple and not anything else. Again, you can get technical and dissect that statement however and as much as you want. The actual truth of the actual thing remains untouched regardless. It's just a statement that describes the truth, even if it does not capture the whole of it. Just because language and thoughts are limited does not make them irrelevant. The difference between saying that an apple is not a banana and saying that an apple is a banana is that the former statement describes less than 0.0000000000000000000000000000001% of reality, while the latter does not describe reality at all. The latter is 0% true.

	The data pretty clearly shows that Scandinavian countries have the highest levels of happiness, health, and overall well-being of all the nations.
</p>

<p>
	So clearly their Social Dem systems are the best mankind has invented so far. They seem to strike a good balance between capitalism and socialism.

	I was sorta forced into it because of my health problems. So I'm not a good measure of such things. I was forced to explore many supplements I otherwise never would.

	If your health is good, then it probably won't be worth it for you. And it also depends very much on your salary. I have money to burn.

<p>
	God is the realization that there is no self, or that the Self is infinite, rather than some limited form.
</p>

<p>
	It's very much like realizing you aren't human but the entire universe.

	All colors, sounds, sensations, feelings, tastes, smells = raw data

<p>
	It's the most fundamental stuff of which reality is made of. These are the true "atoms". You can't boil down the color red any further than itself. You can't boil down the taste of salt any further than itself.

<p>
	Yes, of course! Money is super important if you are building out your life purpose / biz / career. Money is what allows you to avoid becoming some devil boss's bitch slave.
</p>

<p>
	I take money very seriously, even though it's not important in the absolute sense. You should be very prudent and strategic about money. Not to buy toys, but as a resource to enable your creativity. I am very pragmatic about money. You need it and it's not some evil thing. When you set up your LP correctly, money becomes a reflection of your creative output and service to the world.
</p>

<p>
	Here's how you should think about money:

			He seems very action-oriented to me and like he's able to utilize Red aspects to get out of trouble, and use his courage, warrior spirit, and audacity; like he did in this video with Jabba.. Jabba had him surrounded but he acted so cool and like he didn't care at all.  Like fighting, escaping and out-flying others.   It's like that Indiana Jones type of adventurous warrior spirit... lots of action, daring, fighting, etc.  Not too well thought out...  Would you not say those are healthy aspects of Red being put to use?

<p>
	Han has some Red, but I'd say his center of gravity is more Orange.
</p>

<p>
	In the first Star Wars movie Han's entire character arc was about him going from Orange to Green. He was this selfish, independent jackass who was too self-centered to join the rebels, and at the last second he changes his mind and flys in to save Luke from Vader's tie-fighter, enabling Luke to make his shot and destroy the Death Star.
</p>

<p>
	So, basically, Han Solo's story is that of a selfish jackass who had a change of heart and became an SJW.

</p>

<p>
	It's amazing how conservatives can love Star Wars and yet not get that the entire movie is about being a SJW.

	Of course it's all a matter of perspective.

<p>
	There's not some objective solution to such issues. It's all perspectival, relative, and contingent on one's survival agenda.

<p>
	YES! But it's not a space. It is nowhere. Nowhere is the perciever/subject. But notice, this now creates a new duality: nowhere (space) vs the stuff in it. So this is not yet full nonduality. For full nonduality you must realize that all the form is itself identical to the "space" in which it occurs. If you are distinguishing space from its contents, that is still duality.
</p>

<p>
	No-self = True Self
</p>

<p>
	When everything collapses into ONE, there are no more parts. Your mind is trying to grasp at parts but Unity cannot have any. That's why this is so confusing for you. You are trying to grasp Infinity using the mind but that cannot ever work because the mind itself is entangled with the question. There cannot even be 1) a mind, and 2) a thing which the mind grasps. Since that is still duality.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	The chair is not happening in the mind. The chair IS mind. The end.

<p>
	Nope, that won't work. If only it were so easy. People are not going to wake up in large numbers in a libertarian society. Waking up large numbers of people will require serious infrastructure and communal effort.
</p>

<p>
	In a libertarian society, devils and egos will run amok and prevent most people from waking up because they will have to be constantly working to protect themselves from the machinations of the devils. Exactly what we have in America today.
</p>

<p>
	Waking up lots of people requires infrastructure for consciousness.

<p>
	Except there is.
</p>

<p>
	Most women are still highly attracted to masculine guys. So, for example, if a guy wants to get laid by hot girls, then working on his masculinity is important. Otherwise he might end up an angsty, suicidal Incel who shoots up a school.
</p>

<p>
	And there are many other such cases.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, these are very complex survival functions so your mind is not likely to just invent a better alternative.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, gender roles are outdated. And, no, gender roles are not outdated, they are still valuable for most guys and girls. Both things are true at once.

<p>
	In a sense yes. But also consider that they would all perfectly cancel each other out.
</p>

<p>
	You do not necessarily need to display every image on a screen in order to realize that the screen can display an endless number of images. A screen of infinite dimensions could display infinite images. But that doesn't mean it will or that it has to. It could. But it could also just sit back and bask its pure potential without rendering anything at all. The blank screen is still infinite. It's just not expressing itself in an single way. Which you could say, is it's "truest" form. In it's purest form God is pure potential without any need to bias itself towards any one form or experience. God could sit back and not dream anything at all. It gets to decide what it wants.
</p>

<p>
	It's better that you don't think of Infinite Consciousness as merely an endless list of items. It's far more profound than that.

<p>
	Anything that has form will be limited by tautology. You can't be in a human body/mind and know every atom in the material universe because your brain/mind can only handle so much data at once.
</p>

<p>
	My deepest experiences of Infinity are of a pure, formless singularity which is perfectly self-knowing without anything hidden from itself. But part of the reason that's possible is because it's simple. It's not a bunch of data, it's more like a single, infinitely self-interconnected point.

<p>
	It's hard to say because it all depends on you. People react differently to chemicals. You'll have to try many things until you find one that works for you.

<p>
	It is definitely not accessible to all minds. Consciousness is capable of getting itself stuck in cul de sacs, at least until death.
</p>

<p>
	Think of a little child in a Nazi concentration camp being herded into a gas chamber. How free is that child to stop imagining the hell it is in? Not free at all.
</p>

<p>
	But assuming decent environmental conditions and healthy brain neurology, you can direct your mind. Which is what all spiritual work is about in some sense.

<p>
	Yes, red exists Absolutely. All the raw data you see around you exists as an absolute. The problem is that when ego looks at anything absolute, it contextualizes it as "my subjective experiences". But without an ego, your experiences would stop being "yours" and they would even stop being "human experience happening in a brain".
</p>

<p>
	"These are my subjective human experiences" << is a conceptual context which the ego-mind projects/imagines in order to create a sense of self.

<p>
	Go re-watch my videos on What Is Perception? and What Is Actuality? and What Is Truth?
</p>

<p>
	It's all explained there.
</p>

<p>
	Or just take a psychedelic and see it for yourself.

<p>
	Much in our world is socially constructed, but don't forget, that doesn't mean we can or should change it willy-nilly. Social constructions have a certain utilitarian function, which is why they were constructed in the first place. Most social constructions have also survived a long evolutionary process of trail and error and optimization, which means it's unlikely that you will just invent something better from your single small mind.
</p>

<p>
	The logic goes a bit like this: We can all agree that the walls of your house were constructed, but that doesn't mean it is wise to demolish them, as the roof will collapse on your head.
</p>

<p>
	To re-architect a complex thing requires deep intelligence and solid system's thinking. Re-architecting something as time-tested as gender roles is not as easy or harmless as some utopian stage Green folks would like to believe. You can do it, but what will be the down-range consequences?

			It looks like we have found a distinction within omniscience. I’m talking about it by the definition of having all knowledge. Do you believe all knowledge is an aspect of God? You’ve mentioned it being an aspect in one of your God for smart people videos. It seems like here you are equating high consciousness of what is immediately present with omniscience. Unless you’re using a new definition, which it appears you are, this would not serve as omniscience. It seems like you are arguing against the validity of the traditional concept of omniscience. <br />
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			If omniscience is not real, then that makes this whole thread rather useless. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is no way you will understand or appreciate what omniscience truly means until you experience it.
</p>

<p>
	Omniscience is not what normies think it is. The normie notion of omniscience is similar to the normie notion of God. It's very off-the-mark from the actual thing.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I'm using a new definition which comes from a direct experience of omniscience. Omniscience is NOT at the level of human knowledge. True omniscience cuts through all that conceptual human BS. For example, with true omniscience, rather than knowing what your mom ate for lunch today, you will be directly conscious that your mom and her lunch are imaginary. This is far more powerful than knowing what she has for lunch because her having lunch is still within the delusional frame of Maya. True omniscience cuts through Maya like a razor. It is pure 100% NOW-ness. Time and space and others do not exist there because they have been cut through.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is capable of being FULLY, TOTALLY conscious of every aspect of itself. Whether you ever reach such consciousness sober, is another matter. I highly doubt it. Omniscience is way beyond what typical nondual teachers talk about or have ever experienced. Mooji or Tolle will not lead you to omniscience.

<p>
	You can certainly dream up and experience a classic version of Christian hell. Not just one hell, but an infinite different kinds of hell. Some with demons, others without, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	But just because you CAN do that, doesn't mean you will or have to.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to take responsibility for the shit you're dreaming up. If you start imagining demons every day, over and over again, yeah... they will start to become a part of your reality.
</p>

<p>
	The cure to all this is to realize, "Oh yeah! I'm imagining all this and I have some say in what I would prefer to imagine."
</p>

<p>
	If you don't like hell, then stop creating it!
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Perception isn't direct because it is dualistic. "Perception" is a very loaded word here. You have to understand that when he says that perception isn't direct, he does NOT mean that you will discover some new thing behind perception, like some sort of "truer" version of reality. What he means is, everything will stay the same, but you will realize that perception is actually Being by collapsing the subject of perception into the raw data of perception. Perception will get radically recontextualized, but all the raw data, so to speak, will stay exactly the same. If you saw red before, you will keep seeing red during awakening. But now red will be recognized as RED! -- an absolute, rather than a function of some biological human brain process.
</p>

<p>
	I explain all this very well in my videos: What Is Perception? and What Is Actuality?
</p>

<p>
	Being = perception minus ego
</p>

<p>
	RED = red minus a perceiver
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that there can be healthy ways to express Red animalistic impulses in harmless ways. For example, playing a violent video game could a healthy way for kids to experience their Red shadow without hurting anyone and ultimately outgrowing the desire for violence. This, as opposed to kids who start fist-fights at school.

			How can omniscience exist without all things existing at least at some point in time? If at least one partitioned consciousness of God didn’t experience a kangaroo killing Donald Trump with a flamethrower, would it really be omniscient if that is a possibility fully able to be dreamed up by consciousness/God/you? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't think that's particularly necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Omniscience is simply full consciousness of the present moment. Other moments don't need to happen because they are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You can be conscious that reality is an infinite dream without having to dream all the possible dreams. Similar to how you can be conscious that numbers are endless without having to write out every number.
</p>

<p>
	1, 2, 3, 4.... at some point you just get that it can go on forever.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, there is a tradeoff between infinite consciousness and form. To truly be infinitely conscious you will just become an undifferentiated singularity. There will be no forms there, but you will be totally conscious of everything that could ever be.
</p>

<p>
	That is the pure white light at the end of tunnel that some people report to see when they die. It feels like getting sucked into the center of the sun. It's so much consciousness that it has infinite brightness and all form just drowns in it. Imagine a white hole that is infinitely deep.

<p>
	It's mostly rhetorical confusion.
</p>

<p>
	The word experience is used for lack of a better word. Technically experience is dualiatic because it implies an experiencer. When the expeirence and expeirencer merge into one, what remains is Being, which is Absolute Truth. But it looks just like experience.
</p>

<p>
	The way Ralston frames it is needlessly confusing.
</p>

<p>
	What is really being pointed to is experience minus the experiencer.
</p>

<p>
	Teachers use the same words in different ways.
</p>

There is much more to discover. Don't let the mind freak out too much. The nothingness is only one facet of a larger thing so keep exploring other facets.

	If she is so delusional, then why even think about her? Move on to things which have significance.

<p>
	I don't even take socialists seriously in America. True socialism will not happen in America in our lifetime, if ever. It's radically impractical at this time and people are not ready for it.

<p>
	First, we must achieve true democracy. What we have now is a mockery of democracy. America is a plutocracy for all practical purposes.
</p>

<p>
	The reason those philosophers didn't like democracy was because most people in their age were illiterate dumb farmers.

Although I would add, all of that is occurring in YOUR/GOD'S consciousness. You are seeing that YOU/CONSCIOUSNESS has the potential for infinite dreams.

</p>

<p>
	Analogous to what you said above about dosing, you can plug as high a dose as you want until you pass out. It's not like plugging is limited in potency. It's just gonna be a smoother and longer trip rather than a sledgehammer to the head.
</p>

<p>
	To me the biggest downside of vaped DMT is how short and jarring the trip is. If I could plug DMT, I would. I only vape it because plugged doesn't work. And also vaping is bad for your lungs.
</p>

<p>
	I never have a problem with my 5-MeO-DMT trips being too weak. Not once have I come back from a 5-MeO-DMT trip and been like: "Well, that was nice, but I wish it was stronger and hit me 10x faster for 1/5th the time." Even plugged 5-MeO-DMT is too short for the kind of work we're interested in here. We want trips that are 3-4 hours long. Vaping that much DMT wears out my lungs.

	Consciousness can dream up whatever it wants, including your pearly gated heaven. But that doesn't necessarily mean it exists "out there" somewhere in the ether. For it to exist, YOU must dream it up right now.

<p>
	What exists is whatever you put in your consciousness.

Don't pin your life's work on any single thing. You want to start feeling the emotional payoff for your work by doing small projects and getting fan's reactions.

<p>
	Yes, this is all about how you carry yourself and make your approach. There are right and wrong ways to approach and set the proper first impression.
</p>

<p>
	You need to make sure your body language is non-threatening. You also need to be very chill and casual about it. You need to start off immediately by treating her as your girlfriend, not as a stranger. Whatever you feel will transfer onto her. If you are nervous, she will be nervous. If you feel awkward, she will feel awkward.
</p>

<p>
	After I stop her, the first thing I do is I immediately say something to take the edge off. Something like, "Hey, I know this seems random and weird, but I just saw you and thought you were cute. Don't worry, I'm not crazy or anything." And then YOU must carry the conversation. Don't just stop a girl cold and then look at her silently, expecting her to carry the conversation. You gotta start moving your mouth and engage her attention with interesting talk, not awkward silence nor peppering her with boring questions.
</p>

<p>
	It's also super-important that you SMILE on open. Be smiley.
</p>

<p>
	If you open her without smiling, that's your #1 mistake.
</p>

<title>psychedelics hangover</title>

<p>
	Yes, I have noticed that mushrooms and some 4-HO sub-type tryptamines give me a hangover the next day, while other psychedelics do not.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO has no hangover effects at all for me. Neither does DMT from what I recall although I'm less sure about DMT since I've done a lot less of it.
</p>

<p>
	You could experiment with various nootropic supplements or vitamins on the day after to see if they might take the edge off. I get the sense that the brain might simply be lacking nutrients the day after which were used up the day before. If you could supplement that lacking nutrient, theoretically you could stop the hangover.
</p>

<p>
	Let us know if you find something.
</p>

<p>
	Try drinking Slippery Elm bark every day for a few months.
</p>

<p>
	There are other natural supplements along those lines you should try out. Search online to find em.
</p>

<p>
	Also try juicing. Juicing seems to be power for healing gut issues. A huge glass of celery juice every morning. And you can try other juices too. Try that for a month at least.
</p>

<p>
	Also get tested for candida and other bacteria/parasites.
</p>

<p>
	Comprehensive stool testing can be important in this case. You can order test kits like this:

<title>Is it better to change a system from the inside or outside?</title>

<p>
	That will depend on what kind of person you are. Some folks are more insiders, others are more suited to be outsiders.
</p>

<p>
	I'm a strong outsider because I'm very clear in my vision and very independent. Collaboration isn't my cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
	But your personality might be the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	I'm speculating here, but I think what was really going on was that Jerry was cheating on his wife for years and as a way to compensate they came to this arrangement of an open marriage where each would sleep around with whoever they wanted, but maintain the appearance of a traditional marriage because, hey, gotta keep up those good ol Christian family values.
</p>

<p>
	I get the sense that their marriage became stale and died long ago, and they just never got divorced because it was too convenient to officially be together.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sure we'll hear more stories in the future about who Jerry was banging behind the scenes while all this was going on.

	Lots of stuff is a social construct but that doesn't mean it is readily changed.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck getting guys to wear high heels.
</p>

<p>
	Language is one of the most socially constructed things there is. And yet, it's hard to get people to change their vocabulary.

Maybe 5-10% will skew in quirky directions, but most will be happy being more masculine and more feminine.

<p>
	Ah... but it's not so simple.
</p>

<p>
	So long as you are in that physical body, you will have a strong identification with your sex. Sex is a deep physiological aspect of what you are as a human on the relative plane. And this cannot be changed willy-nilly. The hormones running your brain and body play a HUGE role in shaping your raw experience of life, not to mention your thoughts and emotions.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not as easy as having robots do all our physical labor for us.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to completely decouple gender and sex, you'll have to become like a brain in a vat hooked up to some VR game. Or via genetic engineering. But assuming your genes stay that same, you'll have attachments to masculine and feminine qualities.
</p>

	There actually is no such thing as POVs. There is only your direct experience. All POVs are inside your POV.

	Gender is just an aspect of self-identity/ego.
</p>

<p>
	And all identity is relative & imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You could identify with being a unicorn and no one could stop you as long as you believed in it hard enough.
</p>

<p>
	After all, that's exactly what you're doing right now when you identify as a human.
</p>

<p>
	"Human" is a totally imaginary identity.

<p>
	Since Love is absolute, everything that happens is already in the service of Love. So you have no choice in the matter. Whatever you do will increase Love in the world. The more evil you become the more Love your evilness with spawn in response.

<p>
	Have you noticed yet? The evolution of society cannot be stopped. Politics is a force of nature no different than the moon orbiting the Earth.

<p>

<p>
	If you take responsibility for this situation you can socialize with 30 single women in one weekend. Thus increasing your odds of finding the right girl by a factor 30, 50, or 100!
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate how HUGE that is. Imagine x100 fold increase. This is relatively easy to create simply by going out every Fri, Sat, Sun. It's that simple to get a x100 increase. And we haven't even talked about upgrading your skills yet. With upgraded skills you will get another x100 increase.

<p>
	It's not only a numbers game, but when the numbers aren't in your favor you're setting yourself up for failure.
</p>

<p>
	If you were a real estate agent and you only talked to 30 people in 3 months, your children would starve, no matter how good of an agent you were. Being good at real estate requires constantly getting new leads and socializing and meeting dozens of new people every week. Same when dating.
</p>

<p>
	It's not only numbers, but numbers matter a lot. And this actually works in your favor because you can control numbers pretty directly.
</p>

<p>
	You can increase your numbers by x100 starting next week.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Social anxiety can have multiple root causes, some of which might be deep inner trauma which requires doing some inner work. But this is all a big part of pickup work. Pickup is not just about going out every night. It is also very much about correcting your poor inner game, poor mindsets, limiting beliefs, low self-esteem, bad habits, etc. There is a huge psychological component to getting good with women and becoming a strong, confident man. But all that inner game stuff will never be enough if you don't socialize.
</p>

<p>
	You must do BOTH! Inner game and outer game. You must do psychotherapy-type work on your limiting beliefs and low self-esteem AND you must hit the bars and clubs every weekend.
</p>

<p>
	The two synergize, creating an upward spiral.
</p>

<p>
	Incels create a downward spiral by never going out and then creating a toxic ideology to rationalize why going out is pointless and why no girl will like them. This is a toxic cancer of the mind which creates as self-fulfilling prophecy.

<p>
	You can change all those pathways because your brain and mind are plastic. That's the whole point of our work here! Everything about you can change!

<p>
	If you can change your brain to stop constructing ego, you can also change it to be good at socializing.

<p>
	If you want to have sex, you need to socialize a lot more frequently and it will happen. Even without pickup skillz. That is how normies get laid. Normies tend to be fairly social.
</p>

<p>
	The Incel phenomenon is gaining steam so much these days because of the rise of the internet and gaming. Real-world socialization has taken a serious hit. You must consciously over-compensate for it nowadays by pushing yourself to socialize in the flesh even though there's little need to do so (other than for getting laid).
</p>

<p>
	And who knows... you might learn to joy it more than playing Fortnite.

<p>
	It's counter-intuitive: the chasing of bliss is the very thing which prevents it.
</p>

<p>
	Bliss is a consequence of fully facing one's fear and not needing to manipulate your experience.
</p>

<p>
	It's problematic to be doing psychedelics with the expectation of bliss. I would drop that expectation and instead aim for Truth and understanding. Bliss is the fruit off the tree of understanding. Focus on watering the roots of your tree rather than jumping like a thirsty monkey at the unripened green fruits.

<p>
	You don't have to do cold approach per se, but you must re-design your life so that you have more socialization opportunitues with new people, face to face.
</p>

<p>
	The single biggest problem with Incels is that they simply do not leave their mancaves to socialize with humans in the flesh. They are stuck in an online world, where getting laid is virtually impossible.
</p>

<p>
	But also, keep in mind that there is no easy solution to the problem of finding quality partners/sex. Most humans suffer from this problem, which is why they get married and stay together thru thick and thin.
</p>

<p>
	What must be appreciated is that dating is difficult, period! It takes a lot of energy. If you are too lazy to invest that energy then don't expect results.

<p>
	The general problem of not getting sex is a common frustration for guys and girls alike.
</p>

<p>
	Feeling lonely, feeling unattractive, feeling like you will never find the right partner -- these are probably one of the most common concerns for humans around the world.
</p>

<p>
	But that's not the same as what these online incels are doing.

<p>
	You are looking at this in terms of sex.
</p>

<p>
	The proper way to look at it is in terms of growth.
</p>

<p>
	He's not doing those 1000 approaches to get 1 hot girl. He's doing it to overcome his fears and to develop strength as a man. That development will pay dividends for a lifetime. So it's worth doing even if you only get 1 or 2 lays out of it.
</p>

<p>
	And like I said, result grow exponentally. So the next 1000 appraoches after that could produce 2-4 lays. And the next 1000, 4-8 lays, and the next 1000, 8-16 lays. And by that point you are getting more pussy than most guys can dream of.
</p>

<p>
	Business works the same way. The first few years of starting a biz, you work non-stop but earn nothing.

<p>
	It's more nuanced than that.
</p>

<p>
	Incel has become a label that applies to a very specific, narrow group of online trolls who have invented a victim ideology to justify their inability to get laid. It has become an entire sub-culture / online cult.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not as innocent as random guys who are involuntarily celebate. It has become a toxic identity and worldview.

<p>
	The riots are stopped by police already.
</p>

<p>
	Trump could certainly stop the protests by listening to them and putting forth a solution on police reform and increasing black rights.

<p>
	You're looking at this all wrong.
</p>

<p>
	This is not an experience you want to come in trying to avoid, but fully experience and savor.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with getting shot in the face is that you have no idea how scary and traumatic it can be. You think you are macho enough to handle it, but you probably aren't and will just end up freaking yourself out and never trying again.
</p>

<p>
	Slow and steady wins the race here.
</p>

<p>
	You are never going to out-macho or bull your way through psychedelics. They can always dish out more than you can handle.
</p>

	The shocker is, not only is there no sound, there is not even a forest unless you are aware of it.

<p>
	That $8000 would have been better spent traveling to Vegas and living here for 3 months of non-stop club action.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta be smart with how you invest your money.
