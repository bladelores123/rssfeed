<p>
	Taking it once per day or in large doses will not create detoxification, it will merely redistribute toxins deeper into your organs and brain. It's the opposite of detox.
</p>

<p>
	To detox with ALA requires taking it every 3 hours for 3 days straight, including at night while you sleep.
</p>

<p>
	All of neoliberalism and the economic platform of the corporate capitalist DNC.
</p>

<p>
	Capitalism needs serious reforms and structural changes, not just tinkering around edges as Biden plans to do.
</p>

<p>
	We don't necessarily have to go full-socialist, but capitalism needs serious systemic reforms. Right now Neolibs are in denial about the structural problems of capitalism. They pretend as though no structural problems exist. This is a stage Orange disaster.

It's not just an antioxidant. It redistributes heavy metals deep into your organs. Stop taking it.

<p>
	ALA is not a supplement you should ever take unless you are doing a strict detox protocol. ALA will shift heavy metals around in your body and make things worse if you take it as a supplement.

	Sometimes Green does go too far. But in many ways Orange does not go far enough.
</p>

<p>
	Green likes to go too far on social and cultural issues. Orange likes to not go far enough on economic issues.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, Bill Maher is a Boomer. You can't expect too much from him. He's not gonna be a foaming at the mouth socialist. For a Boomer he's doing all right.

	Every decision in life comes with risks.
</p>

<p>
	Strategy is about making wise decisions with imperfect knowledge and no guarantees of success.
</p>

<p>
	You are exhibiting poor strategy, which could end up killing millions of people. Which is why people like you should not occupy positions of power and responsibility.

<p>
	But it's not the same compound. It's not the same purity. And there are many more synthetic chems than anything natural.
</p>

<p>
	All this makes synthetics better. They are more precise, clean, and potent.

</p>

<p>
	The rest is just execution. Start reading books and researching online for courses, programs, trainings, seminars, etc. You will figure it out. You've got plenty of time. You don't need to have all the answers given to you right now. You will figure out all the technical details along the way. What's most important is that you have a clear direction in mind and that you chip away at it every day for months and years.
</p>

<p>
	Spend a couple of years just doing a bunch of online research about business and entrepreneurship. Sign up to some business magazines and slowly, every month you will get new ideas.

<p>
	Don't get me wrong, your life can become a lot better if you are stuck in depression. You don't have to keep being depressed forever.

<p>
	Many severe negative emotional states you can learn to outgrow and just drop. In this way your life will feel much better.

<p>
	This is downright stupid. You should not be doing research chems at all with this attitude.
</p>

<p>
	You must test everything carefully and slowly. Like your life depends on it. Because it does.

<p>
	I wouldn't hope on life getting easier. If you are growing properly, life will always present you with greater and greater challenges.
</p>

<p>
	Life becomes less dysfunctional though, and less about raw survival and the associated negative emotions.
</p>

<p>
	If you become financially independent and secure thanks to your LP, that does take a huge survival load off your shoulders. But life can still be hard. 2020 was one of the hardest years of my life thanks to unforeseen health problems. No amount of success or money or even spiritual work will save you when you have the right kind of health problem.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking though, life is a hamster running endlessly in a wheel until it dies of exhaustion. You are the hamster, and no matter how much success you achieve you ultimately get nowhere. Because there's nowhere else to be. This is one of the biggest things spirituality teaches you. Be. Here. Now. This. Is. It.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't be happy now, you never will be.
</p>

<p>
	If we don't the global economy will be dead for a decade to come.
</p>

<p>
	Vaccine is the only thing that will save the economy at this point.
</p>

<p>
	You can cry all you want about the dangers of vaccines, but consider the dangers of a 10-year global Great Depression with 30% unemployment and 50% of businesses closed forever.
</p>

<p>
	The choice is yours. Choose wisely.

	There is nothing wrong with shitting where you eat.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is when you shit where you eat and then you complain about the taste.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing judgmental or egotistical about pointing out that mankind tends to shit where it eats and then loves to cry about it as though some great evil was cast upon mankind by God.
</p>

<p>
	Don't shit where you eat and then you won't need to cry or blame God.
</p>

<p>
	Most of mankind's problems are self-created.

<p>
	No other way, brother. This game involves some risk. If you can't handle the fire, get out of the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
	If it is 5-MeO-MIPT or 5-MeO-DALT or something similar in the 5-MeO category, you will generally have a profound experience and it will not harm you.
</p>

<p>
	The only real danger with research chems is if they send you something totally not a tryptamine. And usually the only reason that would happen is if they make a serious mistake in labeling. No tryptamine is gonna kill ya. Worst you'll get is a bad trip.
</p>

<p>
	I would stay away from 5-MeO-DPT though, it's a nasty one.

	Usually rectal psychedelics are faster and more potent than oral.

	The potency of psychedelic administration routes is like this:

		<p>
			So, what are your thoughts and do you have any advises for me?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Your problem is not what you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with serious personal development is that you must resolve problems at new levels of consciousness, not within the same old paradigms.
</p>

<p>
	Here's your real problem: you've selected a zero-sum career. Your success essentially requires stealing money from others and having them lose money. Your career entirely hinges on competition, so of course you will be fearful of being out-competed because that's exactly what happens in a competition paradigm. There is always someone better than you who will eat your lunch. Always. You're playing a game you can't really win, and that's not satisfying. And naturally it comes with fear of being beaten. Because you will be.
</p>

<p>
	The solution here is radical: change your entire entire paradigm to non-zero-sum. Make your career about creativity and value-generation rather than leeching value from other humans. This way you will have little to fear because your success will only be limited by personal creative effort and energy.
</p>

<p>
	I've done business in the zero-sum competitive paradigm before and it sucks compared to the non-zero-sum creative paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Do you see what I mean about solving problems at new levels of consciousness? The problem is always deeper and more meta than you first imagine.
</p>

<p>
	You are lucky to have the success you'd had thus far. I would save up money and plan a transition to a truly creative and value-offering career. Not just a career but a life purpose. You have no idea how much of your creative potential and intelligence you are wasting on leeching money from other humans. You could be doing so much more with your life. But of course, you're afraid to move on. << That's where the true fear of failure and success arises. Not in playing poker better, but in moving on to something truly creative beyond poker. Something that will demand much more of your heart and soul.
</p>

<p>
	When you die, on your tombstone do you want it to be written: "This guy spent his whole life clicking on an LCD screen to leech money from others because he was too sacred to do something truly creative and profound with his life."
</p>

<p>
	One of the core Buddhist precepts is "right livelihood".
</p>

<p>
	Using meditation and yoga to leech money from others is a perversion of these holy practices.
</p>

<p>
	Think about it.
</p>

<p>
	If you're serious about growing in this area, take my Life Purpose Course which explains all this and much more in great detail.
</p>

<p>
	That will reveal their lack of understanding of Spiral Dynamics. So let's see the quality of what people post. If people are mostly posting unhealthy toxic cartoonish stuff, then they're failing the test.

	Men and women are equally selective with their mating. The selection criteria is very different for both sides, but the pressure to be selective is of equal force for both, just in different ways. You will understand this when you fully step outside your gender's survival biases and look at the situation objectively.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you did a careful study of lions, you would see that male lions and female lions are both equally selective of their mates, but in different ways. It's easier to see in lions because you're not a lion, so there's no conflict of interest problem or self-bias clouding your view.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Here's a fun way of learning Spiral Dynamics: try to play-act the role of any given stage, like a good actor. And really feel that stage's worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Example: How would stage Blue see gay people? Imagine it! Adopt the Blue perspective on homosexuality as if it was your own.
</p>

<p>
	So.... "Homosexuality is against God's will as written in the Bible. It is deviant behavior which will condemn a soul to hell unless it repents and asks for forgiveness. Therefore to legalize gay marriage is for our society to sanction sin and evil. If God sees too many of us descend into sin and the rest of us cave in to this depravity and debauchery without speaking out for righteousness, then our whole society will be forsaken by God. Therefore it is everyone's duty to call out sinfulness whenever it is seen and to fight against it. So we must either help these sinners get on the righteous path to God, or if they refuse, we must cast them out of our society so they don't corrupt our children and rip apart the fabric of our righteous society. Just because a few men on the Supreme Court think gay marriage is Constitutional does not matter because ultimately it's still a sin. The US Constitution is secondary to the will of God. A sin which is 'Constitutional' is still a sin and we should not support it because being righteous is more important than following some human-made law which changes with the wind. For these reasons we should obviously also not allow gay people to adopt kids, teach kids in schools, or kiss in public."
</p>

<p>
	You see the idea.
</p>

<p>
	Now give it a shot.
</p>

<p>
	The exercise only works if you really are able to look at the whole another set of eyes besides your own.
</p>

<p>
	So, I invite you guys to try it out. Post your results here. You can do this for a range of topics, not just homosexuality. And you can do it from all the Spiral stages: Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow, Turquoise
</p>

<p>
	Here are some topics to jog your mind:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Homosexuality
	</li>
	<li>
		Transgender people
	</li>
	<li>
		Gender is a social construct
	</li>
	<li>
		Trump
	</li>
	<li>
		Obama
	</li>
	<li>
		Global warming
	</li>
	<li>
		Abortion
	</li>
	<li>
		Gun control
	</li>
	<li>
		Capitalism
	</li>
	<li>
		Socialism
	</li>
	<li>
		Racism
	</li>
	<li>
		Sex education
	</li>
	<li>
		War
	</li>
	<li>
		Pickup
	</li>
	<li>
		Cancel culture
	</li>
	<li>
		God
	</li>
	<li>
		New Age teachings
	</li>
	<li>
		Relativism
	</li>
	<li>
		Post-modernism
	</li>
	<li>
		Jordan Peterson
	</li>
	<li>
		Sam Harris
	</li>
	<li>
		Atheism
	</li>
	<li>
		And many more
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If you decide to give it a shot, be creative with your post and tell us which color and which topic you are writing about. If you're doing this, the key here is to steel-man rather than strawman whichever stage you select. Make the stage seem rational, plausible, truthful, and good -- because each stages sees itself that way.
</p>

<p>
	And most importantly, as you type out your reply, notice how it feels to speak and think from within that particular worldview. Feel how your mind is forced to shift from your native way of seeing the world. Notice the relativity of all worldviews.
</p>

<p>
	What you must realize is: THAT is ego!
</p>

<p>
	Self-denial, being a doormat for others, people-pleasing, putting on a fake front of selflessness, trying to be a good boy or girl << ALL of that is ego. This is the ego playing the role of the selfless saint.
</p>

<p>
	This is not true selflessness. It's ego aping selfless behavior, which is actually very selfish and problematic.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that is ego, but it's a better, more honest, more developed form of ego than what you were doing before.
</p>

<p>
	The trap you've fallen into is that you've adopted the selfless saint ego while in your mind harshly judging normal healthy ego which needed fro satisfying basic survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	Life requires that you satisfy your needs within reason in healthy ways and don't act with fake selflessness. When you try to act and pretend as though you don't have needs but really you do have needs, this becomes a big problem because it is untrue and dishonest. You are being dishonest with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It is much healthier to say, "I'm horny and I need sex" than it is to say, "I'm so pure I don't need that dirty thing called sex", but then secretly you have sexual fantasies all the time. In this case the more developed and healthier form of ego is to just be honest and admit: "I need sex. I love sex! I'm like a sex-addicted animal!" << Good! That's progress. At least that's true! You always want to start from a position of honesty and realness, not fakery.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't worry about your own survival, who else will? The ego's function is survival. This is very necessary if you want to stay alive.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Is the detachment from ego implies that you must feel dead inside?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not at all. This is a big misunderstanding of detachment and ego-death. Ego-death makes you feel alive inside.
</p>

<p>
	What you must realize is that detachment and egolessness cannot be faked. The only way to truly be selfless is to reach such a high state of consciousness that you are directly conscious that the ego isn't real. When an ego tries to pretend to be egoless but it doesn't have sufficient consciousness to realize it isn't real, that's disaster.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to really grow, you must start but admitting and giving up all your spiritual fakeness. The ego loves to adopt high spiritual ideas as if it can embody them. It can't. The ego has to realize its own unreality.
</p>

<title>I am struggling dealing with cancer</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/22809-no_thing__/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="22809" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/22809-no_thing__/" rel="">@No_thing__</a> Sorry to hear of your situation.
</p>

<p>
	I see a couple of issues here:
</p>

<p>
	1) I wouldn't worry about personal or spiritual development right now. You don't need that extra stress. Take it easy and focus all your efforts at healing. You can return to self-actualizing once you're healed. In a sense this is a wake-up call for you to start taking your health much more seriously and be proactive about it.
</p>

<p>
	2) The question of facing your death is a very serious one. The best way to achieve this quickly is through psychedelics like mushrooms or LSD. These are proven to help people cope with fear of death. What you can realize is that you are not this one life or this one body/mind/persona. So if you can get your hands on some mushrooms, they can help ease your fears about death. Death is not a bad thing. It is Infinity/Love/God. It is good to have some direct experience of this as you face life and death matters like this cancer. Spiritual understanding will give you peace.
</p>

<p>
	I've done so many psychedelics that I'm kinda looking forward to my death now. This human realm is so limited. Nothing of great importance will be lost. Greater things lie ahead.
</p>

<p>
	3) I would focus a lot of your energy on researching various possible health solutions for cancer. Don't just blindly follow the advice of Western doctors. You need to look into alternative methods, read, research, talk to people, find healers, etc. There is much about cancer and its treatment which conventional Western doctors do not understand and will never tell you about. But of course take the medicine you need. Never give up researching. You can find some amazing stuff.
</p>

<p>
	I use it. Hard to say how effective it is given all the other stuff I use/try.
</p>

<p>
	Probably not as effective as DMSA + ALA
</p>

<p>
	For zeolite to be effective is needs to be in synthetic nano-particle form, no merely clay. The clay is not gonna pass the blood-brain barrier, but the nano-particles should.

	Basically ANY art can be turned into millions of dollars if you are serious enough about it. Makes little difference what the art is: singing, dancing, sculpture, films, cartoons, novels, video games, woodworking, painting, design, legos, 3D modeling, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Success comes from turning it into a business. No one is going to do it for you or hand you a bunch of money. You must build it.

<p>
	It all depends on how it is "forced".
</p>

<p>
	Obviously the "force" has to be subtle and soft, not a literal quota to hit simply for sake of diversity. And the diverse people have to be well-qualified.

<p>
	So did Biden. That's simply because people have become a lot more politically engaged since 2016. The outrages have polarized both sides and made politics exciting again. So more people show up to vote, both smart ones and dumb ones.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, majority of people don't vote at all. All you have to do to get to show up is to make politics exciting again.

For example, yours is a masculine, mind oriented awakening, so yours will be way different and will have different abilities/attributes based on the way your consciousness works already. In a sense, were all gifted, just in different dimensions of consciousness. For some people spirituality could be a very sexual, creative and tantric act, and that could be their focus throughout their lifetime, or one could be very grounded, earthly, and thats their focus. if we look at spirituality instead of attaining enlightenment and put the focus on awakening our multidimensional nature, this could be recognized more. Im sure you've noticed this within your very logical and conceptual oriented mind. Also I wouldn't put the better/worse labels on it.

<p>
	I haven't seen any good evidence that glutathion will detox heavy metals.
</p>

<p>
	To detox heave metals you need to detox it from your organs and brain. Which means the molecule has to cross the blood-brain barrier. Which very few molecules will do.

<p>
	Not only is it safe, if you have a deficiency, it would be unsafe to take anything less than 10,000 IU.
</p>

<p>
	I've taken 10,000 IU every day for months and even a year+ at a time.
</p>

<p>
	1,000 IU is nothing. It's not even worth taking so little.

	Exactly the same way a chemical allows you to see, think, and move.

<p>
	And today we see the opposite problem: Blue and Orange has demonized Green to the point of nearly ending democracy in America.
</p>

<p>
	If Green is only 10%, then why is Wilber so eager to get to Yellow? How can society get to Yellow without embracing Green first?
</p>

<p>
	I find it baffling that Wilber acknowledges that Green is only at 10% yet he says Green is so dangerous that we must jump over it to Yellow. If Green is only 10%, then clearly our task is to move the lower 90% to Green, so that we can eventually move beyond Green. But how can we move the 90% to Green when Wilber keeps telling us how bad Green is???
</p>

<p>
	Wilber's a brilliant guy, but on this point he's so clearly wrong.

<p>
	Of course.

<p>
	Relationships are good grist for the mill of consciousness work. Nothing reveals your ego more than an intimate relationship. There is much to be learned from relationships.

<p>
	No, I never said that.
</p>

<p>
	You can be deeply enlightened but then what? You got another 40 years to live. What are you gonna do with all that time?
</p>

<p>
	A relationship is a way to spice up your life. Nothing wrong with that. As long as you understand that's what you're doing.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying you shouldn't do relationships. I'm just saying, understand why you do relationships. The spice has a cost. It ain't free.
</p>

<p>
	A .22 pistol is actually ideal for most home defense situations because it's so damn accurate and lowest volume. Large caliber guns are not very practical for civilian use. In an actual gun fight the most important thing will be accuracy, speed, and not blowing out your ears.

			So Jim Newman is correct in sayingÂ no one ever hasÂ any relationships and that theÂ only thing in the whole of âexistenceâ is what appears to be happeningÂ in theÂ moment.Â No past. NoÂ future. No free will. No self. Just what arises in the moment.Â 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, but relationships arise in the moment.
</p>

<p>
	Imagination is reality. So if you believe you're in a relationship, that's what is real for you.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that relationships don't exist, it's just that relationships are recontextualized after awakening. They exist as imagination.

<p>
	Of course.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason to be in a relationship with anyone or anything is to fulfill something you lack.
</p>

<p>
	Think about it. Why else would you relate to anything? If you relate to anything, it is giving you some payoff.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why the wisest sages live alone in a cave. They need nothing but God. But of course living alone in a cave is boring as fuck.

<p>
	It's like you bought a dog and are now asking, "But how do I get it to stop eating?"
</p>

<p>
	That's never gonna happen.
</p>

<p>
	The entire function of this relationship (why you want it at all) is to fill a hole in your life. So of course if this relationship should ever end (and it always does), you will suffer. The better the relationship, the more its end will hurt you.
</p>

<p>
	When you sign up for an intimate relationship it is like you are strapping yourself into a rollercoaster.
</p>

<p>
	That's what a relationship is. And that's what you want it to be, too. You want that thrill and drama. You get off on it.

<p>
	Yes, that's the link.
</p>

<p>
	You can call them for free and ask them questions. They will answer anything you want to know about coaching.
</p>

<p>
	Of course keep in mind they are trying to sell you on coaching, so they aren't exactly unbiased. But overall they are honest folks.

<p>
	Because:
</p>

<p>
	A) Half the country is low consciousness and ignorant as fuck. Many people are Red/Blue or Blue/Orange, which loves Trump and hates Green.
</p>

<p>
	B) Because social media has created a reality bubble echochamber full of propaganda and disinformation for profit. Trump has hijacked these media mechanisms to basically create a virtual cult built upon demonizing stage Green. The more stage Green is demonized, people at stage Red/Blue/Orange are left with no other alternative but to side with Trump.
</p>

<p>
	If according to your worldview your only choice is between Trump vs socialist pedophiles, you're gonna happily go with Trump.

<title>Do ALL celebrities actually have top-level work ethic?</title>

<p>
	Basically anyone who's mega-successful has a crazy work ethic. Because they had to work their ass off consistently for decades to get there.
</p>

<p>
	The cost of mega-success is usually giving up your whole life for it. Which is why the most successful people are poorly spiritually developed. They sold their soul to the devil.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why Jesus said that it's easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than it is for a rich man to get into heaven.
</p>

<p>
	You will never become a celebrity without a crazy work ethic.

<p>
	No he wouldn't.
</p>

<p>
	People have made up their minds about Trump long before covid.
</p>

<p>
	Like I told you guys a long time ago, people do not vote on policy, they vote their Spiral stage. It doesn't matter what the policies are.
</p>

<p>
	My prediction of Trump's loss was based purely on Spiral stages. He was clearly too low-consciousness for the majority of American's to approve of. His cult base love him, but the other 60-70% of Americans can clearly see that Trump is a low-consciousness monster. And that is why he lost. Trump loyalists don't understand it because they live in reality bubble of their own creation and they don't see outside that bubble.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason Trump won in 2016 is because people did not know what a monster Trump was. They assumed he was just a successful businessman (Orange), but then they saw that he was more Red than Orange. Trump won in 2016 because the mainstream media did a terrible job in covering Trump's monstrosities and educating the public about what a Trump admin would look like. People were allowed to believe the myth that Trump would be this great business leader, which was a joke to begin with because he was always failed at business. But now everyone's seen that Trump is totally incompetent. So Trump can't run the same con again. He snuck in under the radar in 2016. That was his biggest advantaged which has now evaporated.
</p>

<title>How to become a Life Coach? I am considering a career change from Counselor to Coach</title>

<p>
	It's not demanding at all. It's not regulated at all.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need anything to be a life coach. You don't even need a certificate. You could call yourself a life coach today. Of course that doesn't make you skilled.
</p>

<p>
	In practice it's a good idea to go through a certification training. That usually costs $10,000 and takes about a year.
</p>

<p>
	I finished IPEC. It's a pretty good training.
</p>

<p>
	What "is there" means is... you are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	Your friend is there in the same way anything "is there". It isn't. But you imagine it is, and that is what you call "reality".

</p>

<p>
	50 armor penetrating rounds, almost no recoil, compact, reliable, accurate.
</p>

<p>
	I've shot it full-auto at the Vegas range. Incredible!

<p>
	Of course it's possible to miss with a taser. That's it's biggest downside. Its range is pretty limited too.

	I shot a police taser at a cantalope.Â 
</p>

<p>
	The taser darts penetrated the catalope 50% through, and they are barbed like fish hooks.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that hitting your body plus massive voltage for 30 seconds. You will be totally fucked if you are hit. A police taser is no joke.
</p>

<p>
	If you were tasered in the face, you'd be dead.

<p>
	Depends on why you buy it.
</p>

<p>
	If out of a legit threat on your life, okay.
</p>

<p>
	But most people who buy guns have no legit threat on their life and never will.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives greatly exaggerate threat on their life. As if anyone cares about attacking them.

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			The libertarian US economist Murray Rothbard (1926-1995) wrote in his book 'Ethics of Liberty', that parents should have the right to put a child out for adoption or sell the rights to the child in a voluntary contract. Rothbard suggested selling children as consumer goods in accordance with market forces, would benefit "everyone" involved in the market: "the natural parents, the children, and the foster parents. In Rothbard's view, "the parent should not have a legal obligation to feed, clothe, or educate his children, since such obligations would entail positive acts coerced upon the parent and depriving the parent of his rights." Thus, parents should have the legal right to let any infant die by starvation. However, since "the purely free society will have a flourishing free market in children" he wrote, "the existence of a free baby market will bring such 'neglect' down to a minimum".

			With the background of Epigenetics, you have the ability to up-regulate the genes responsible for "increasing consciousness". Rather profoundly. Dispenza's work is founded on epigenetics. His book "becoming supernatural - common people doing the uncommon" is all about "normal" people having profound mystical experiences absent of drugs. Moreover, he is affirming that age, background, level of trauma etc. doesn't affect your capacity/potential to experience the mystical.<br />

	That's possible, but all that is still very limited.

	You can go to the gym and lift weights, but you will never match a professional bodybuilder like Arnold.
</p>

<p>
	No one can match Arnold because he was born specifically for that role.

<p>
	You have no idea what challenges girls face in dating. Because all you care about is your own survival.

<p>
	But if you don't care about the survival needs of others, why should we care about yours?

	Your position is so wrong I can't even take it seriously enough to put effort into debunking it.

	You are complaining that you aren't getting your deserved share of pussy, and you want something like communism for pussy. How cute.
</p>

<p>
	The dating marketplace is perfectly fair. Women shop for the best men they can get and guys shop for the best girls they can get. If you are unhappy with the quality of women you get, raise your value. Don't go asking for handouts. No woman owes you anything. Just like you don't owe a woman anything.

I do not agree personally with the "girl fucks so she is slut while guy fucks so who is boss" mindset since it it VERY hypocritical and double standards. However, there should be something to balance it out. The problem with letting girls have sex endlessly is that they will choose only the highest quality guys (usually good looking ones in developed countries and rich ones in not developed countries) and there will be a monopolization of vagina from these guys

</p>

<p>
	It's not that you're sexist, you're just unconscious and self-centered. You don't know what it's like to be a woman and you project your own needs onto the situation.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that women are not at all free to have one night stands. A woman feels bad about having one night stands because her friends, family, and future male partners will judge her for being a slut. The more sexual partners she has, the lower her value drops, the harder it will be for her to attract and keep a high quality man. Moreover, the more risk she incurs. The risk of one night stands for women is much higher than for men. A man has little to lose, a woman has a lot to lose.
</p>

<p>
	Men are not judged very much for being players. When a man is a player, people think of him as just a cool guy and don't shame him for it. And women become MORE attracted to him, not less because it's demonstrates that he is an attractive, strong guy -- a stud.
</p>

<p>
	The more sex a man has, the higher his value rises. The more sex a woman has, the lower her value falls. Which is why most guys inflate their number of sexual partners and most women deflate their number.
</p>

<p>
	Often times even when a woman wants to have sex with a guy she cannot because of how her friends and family will judge her as an irresponsible low-value slut.

If mainstream media was taken over by partisan right-wing hacks, American democracy would be doomed. Which is why attacks on and conspiracy theories about the mainstream media are so harmful and devilish.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever faults and biases the mainstream media has, it still plays a crucial function in presenting factual information that democracy needs to stay afloat. Media is needed to accurately report who won the election.

	Not at all.

<p>
	Yes, it's gonna be very challenging marketing high-consciousness material because 99% of the population is low consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do that, you need to build some kind of bridge or funnel which meets people at their low consciousness level and slowly exposes them to higher consciousness material over time.
</p>

<p>
	It's very challenging to start a high consciousness business as your first biz. You might want to start with a lower consciousness biz just to shore up your financial base, and then build on top of that.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely nobody will ever care about your life purpose. Your customers are completely selfish and will only care about the survival value your product/service offers them. Your life purpose is for you, not for them. You must invent a way to translate your LP into tangible value for your customers. In this way they will indirectly care about your LP via the value it gives them.
</p>

<p>
	I've actually seen this happen.
</p>

<p>
	The result can be surprising.
</p>

<p>
	The DMT can lessen their consciousness!
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are not guaranteed to work on everyone. People respond differently to them. Sometimes extremely differently. I've seen people not respond to DMT, or respond negatively.
</p>

<p>
	It's a lock and key system. There must be a proper fit between the two.
</p>

<p>
	If you give Sadhguru DMT, it might be counter-productive for him.

<p>
	I don't know exactly. Genetics certainly plays a huge role in determining your baselineÂ neurotransmitter cocktail.
</p>

<p>
	If we knew how to edit genes, we might be able to increase your baseline consciousness by a factor of 1000x.

From spiritual retards to gods.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I've met people who were born awakened and live multiple liveÂ simutaneously in parallel from birth.
</p>

<p>
	Stop assuming that other humans are like you. Their consciousness can be totally different than yours.
</p>

<p>
	An advanced yogi is gonna be in the top 1% of the spiritual bell curve with zero practice. And then he will add 1000s of hours of practice on top of that. So you, an average guy, have no hope of attaining his level naturally.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Take psychedelics, amazing awakenings will result. Simple. You are over-thinking things. Stop worrying about things which ain't a problem.
</p>

<p>
	If you are so worried about visuals, take 5-MeO-DMT.

This is not some untested thing.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, I've taken other psychedelics which have lots of visuals and the visuals do not obscure the profundity of the trip.
</p>

<p>
	You seem to be stuck on visuals for some reason when there's no reason to be. Visuals don't obscure a trip any more than they obscure meditation.

<p>
	Even if you get lots of visuals it does not contradict meditation.
</p>

<p>
	The visuals are not the most significant part, the expanded consciousness is.
</p>

<p>
	Visuals + expanded consciousness will be more profound and insightful than any meditation. Especially on DMT. The insight on DMT is second to none and will knock your socks off no matter how much you've meditated.
</p>

<p>
	DMT is like God ejaculating his seed all over your face from a firehose until you drown.

<p>
	Much of it is healed in the moment of the trip, during the peak. And then there is further healing during the post-trip integration phase, which can last from a few days to a few weeks. This will vary a lot from person to person.

<p>
	Of course. You can easily heal whatever trauma is there. Just set the intention to do so. Any traumas that hold you back will naturally surface as you go deeper into your trips, and you will be forced to confront and heal them before you can dive deeper.

<p>
	My version of it is quite different because of all the psychedelics I've done.
</p>

<p>
	I basically used psychedelics a lot to face difficult truth, which sometimes result in difficult trips and long periods of integration.
</p>

<p>
	PsychedelicsÂ take the edge off by showering you with Infinite Love and divinity. This aspect is missing a lot of times for people who only do self-inquiry. Without psychedelics you tend to get the no-self but not the God/Love.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing like Love to sweeten the bitterness of ego loss.
</p>

<p>
	But no matter what, deconstructing the ego is challenging and bitter-sweet.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to see some light at the end of the tunnel, try a psychedelic.
</p>

The first psychedelic revolution didn't live up to its promises. But I think the second psychedelic revolution can go much better. We were not ready in the 1960s.

	Proof if always a second order activity of the mind. Proof is indirect. It is always happening at the symbolic level. Truth is prior to symbols.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Because your ideas of happiness are not true. They are corruptions of the ego-mind. So what you're pursuing when you pursue happiness, is falsehood and devilry.
</p>

<p>
	If you pursue happiness, you will likely not reach happiness nor truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you pursue truth, you will likely reach truth and true happiness will dawn.
</p>

<p>
	Happiness is the fruit of discovering Truth. When you want a juicy apple, don't worry about finding an apple, focus your attention on watering the roots of your apple tree. Children chase after apples. Adults water the apple tree roots.
</p>

<p>
	Just by committing to and aligning your life with Truth you will already become a lot happier.
</p>

<p>
	Don't assume all spiritual paths lead to the same place. Some paths lead orders of magnitude higher than others.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, you must find which will take you highest. There is not one path that is highest for all people.

<p>
	Here's the key thing that scientists misunderstand about falsifiability: It is impossible to falsify Truth.
</p>

<p>
	It's so obvious. But they don't get it.
</p>

<p>
	So when an atheist says God isn't real because it cannot be falsified, that's absurd because the very nature of God is that it's impossible to falsify, which is precisely what makes it true.
</p>

<p>
	The notion of falsifiablility in science is much overrated. Most actual science is done through confirmation, not falsification. You need both, and you must use both intelligently. Neither one alone is sufficient.

<p>
	This is obvious to anyone who tries them with an open mind.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will revolutionize spirituality, religion, science, society, and politics.
</p>

<p>
	Everything before the psychedelic revolution that's coming will be considered the the Dark Ages. And Sadhguru's words will be on record now as defending the Dark Ages of spirituality. And my words will be on record as one of the early pioneers of the revolution.

<title>Sadhguru saying &quot;Drugs will lead to America's Downfall&quot;</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/56823-sadhguru-saying-drugs-will-lead-to-americas-downfall/?do=findComment&amp;comment=761192</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Firstly, on a strictly practical level, the war on drugs has been an abysmal racist failure. Countries which decriminalize drugs, even the worst drugs like meth and heroin, end up doing better, having less death, violence, and addiction. This has been scientifically measured.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, very very very few people will ever be able to develop the intoxication factory that Sadhguru is talking about. Less than 1% of the population will do it. Less than 1% of the population will awaken. For the other 99%, psychedelics are now scientifically proven to provide many benefits such a reducing depression, PTSD, social anxiety, fear of death, addiction recovery, anger reduction, healing childhood trauma, etc. This very important stuff strictly from a medical, social, and political perspective.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, psychedelics open the doorway to mystical experience. Most people don't even believe mysticism is real. So they will never discover it through Sadhguru's methods. Psychedelics offer a way to access what Sadhguru is teaching in a more direct, scientific way.
</p>

<p>
	Fourthly, you will never naturally reach the level of consciousness possible via psychedelics using Sadhguru's methods. Never.
</p>

<p>
	Fifthly, of course coke and meth should be distinguished from psychedelics. To talk about these in the same conversation is absurd. We should treat coke and meth differently in that we should help people get off them and onto psychedelics instead. But total decriminalization is the way to go for all drugs. We have tried 50 years of prohibition and it's failed spectacularly.
</p>

<p>
	Sixthly, once you get your hands on the right psychedelics, you will never need to listen to Sadhguru or any guru again. Psychedelics are a far better guru than a human could ever be. The only reason human gurus exist is because the psychedelic guru has been criminalized and demonized. Psychedelics serve an important function in deconstructing the spiritual and religion cults which inevitably arise around gurus. Once Sadhguru is dead, his organization will turn into just another cult religion. And his followers will become devils. Psychedelics are an antidote to that.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru sounds wise here, but he's actually being dumb, impractical, and misleading his followers.
</p>

<p>
	Of course data, information, and even knowledge is not intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	People confuse knowledge for intelligence. As if reading a bunch of books = intelligence
</p>

<p>
	Memorizing facts and figures is the opposite of intelligence.

<p>
	Of course you don't necessarily have to call it "systems thinking". But some kind of awareness of systems is necessary I think. You have to start to see the world in terms of complex interlocking systems. You have to have some interest in systems because you recognize the importance they play in human life.
</p>

<p>
	The health care system
</p>

<p>
	The education system
</p>

<p>
	The economic system
</p>

<p>
	The business system
</p>

<p>
	The media system
</p>

<p>
	The energy system
</p>

<p>
	Science as a system
</p>

<p>
	Religion as a system
</p>

<p>
	Culture as a system
</p>

<p>
	The ecology of the planet
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can't just avoid thinking about these things because you are embedded in them and they control you.

People seriously need to read the book, but they won't cause they are lazy.
</p>

<p>
	If I shot the Blue, Orange, and Green videos today, they would be a lot more nuanced because my understanding of Spiral Dynamics has deepened a lot over the last 2 years. Which is why the Purple and Red videos are more accurate.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem with Spiral Dynamics is that it take A LOT of hours to learn it accurately. You're looking at 100+ hours of research and several years of application to learn it properly. Which makes it very difficult to teach to newbies with short attention spans and no interest in reading.
</p>

<p>
	Learning Spiral Dynamics requires a lot of trail and error and misapplication. In a sense, misuse of SD is a big part of learning it.
</p>

<p>
	No!

<p>
	That's your mistake right there! You are distinguishing that vs this. Stop doing that! This is the same as that.
</p>

<p>
	You are creating a subtle duality between this and that.

<p>
	What remains is infinite consciousness. Same as always. Just minus the particular forms you are attached to. Consciousness without forms is just empty void. This is the Godhead.

			Also, i went through the phase of mental breakdown and of going crazy. Now i stopped meditating. I feel i need guidance with this, real life guidance. I need to seek some kind of enlightened master if i want to go further. What would you raccomand leo?

<p>
	Well, awakening is very radical. Yes, it can feel like going insane sometimes. But also, there is a difference. If you feel like you are going to harm yourself, then stop and seek help.
</p>

<p>
	In the end no one can help you awaken but yourself. The enlightened master you seek is just another egoic attachment and failure to take 100% authority over your consciousness as God. No one can make you realize that you're God but you. Since you're God. Ta-da!
