</p>

<p>
	In general, if you want Green+, avoid applying to giant companies. You want a smaller, more personal operation. I would never work for a giant company in any field. It's a meat-grinder and I want no part of it.

Stage Green companies.
</p>

<p>
	But you can't be too idealistic about it because all companies cause collateral damage. You can't run a large company without some exploitation of someone.
</p>

<p>
	For example you could invest in Tesla if you think electric cars are good for mankind. But Tesla of course still exploits its workers.
</p>

<p>
	One of the reasons I don't invest in stocks much any more is because its hard to find non-exploitative ones. I used to invest in oil companies and make a decent return, but can't bring myself to do that any more.
</p>

<p>
	If you really don't want to exploit others, earn your money from your own creative labor, not investing.
</p>

<p>
	It's not a good idea to classify entire stages as masculine or feminine. Masculine/feminine is a typology which cuts across all stages. Likewise, introvert/extrovert cuts across all stages.

<p>
	That's exactly what most Eastern monks and yogis are like. Zen masters are famous for this kind of behavior. They can be very enlightened but sexist, racist, homophobic, nationalistic, etc. because the mind is still at stage Blue due to the culture it is steeped in.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment will not rewire your entire mind and it will not deprogram it of all cultural biases and beliefs. That requires much more work.

<p>
	Like all things, government can be used in good ways and bad ways.
</p>

<p>
	Corruption always exists, there are many degrees of it, but it can be rooted out by electing effective higher consciousness leaders with managerial experience.
</p>

<p>
	As but one example, this guy is doing a good job looking out for his people:

<p>
	This is good leadership and good government. Without leadership like this you'd be living in a hellhole.

			My argument was about actual investigations. I am well aware that mindless accusations are problematic, but if there is a basis like being able to investigate all of the visitors of Epsteins island, what speaks against such an investigation and how is it that it hasn't been done?

<p>
	By all means, let the FBI investigate crime.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know they aren't investigating it?
</p>

<p>
	And keep in mind, an investigation is only possible if there is good evidence. Tons of crime goes uninvestigated because the evidence is not strong enough. This doesn't mean it's a conspiracy. The FBI works very hard to nail criminals but it's difficult work.

	In ancient Rome, 30-40% of the population were slaves.
</p>

<p>
	When a neighboring city was conquered, all of its men would have their throats slit, all the women and children would be raped and sold as slaves. That's the true meaning of a war. Every citizen's life is on the line and they know it. If the wall is breached, everyone is fucked.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest reasons men joined the army and went to war is that if they won, they got to rape all the women for free. For many this was their only chance for sex.
</p>

<p>
	We've made some progress.
</p>

<p>
	You live in so much luxury you have no idea what true inequality even means:

<p>
	Vaccines are a public need and I'm not saying they don't have some side-effects. When you have small pox or Black Death, there's a cost to stopping it but the cost of not stopping it is far worse.

<p>
	I myself have some legit concerns about heavy metals in vaccines.
</p>

<p>
	But I don't doubt the necessity of some vaccines for serious diseases.
</p>

<p>
	It's a complex issue with delicate tradeoffs.

<p>
	That's the thing though.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea what's going on. You have wild speculation and projection which you confuse for truth.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea who raped anyone. That's the truth. So think twice before starting a virtual lynch mob.

	Good. Thank you.

			I disagree with you regarding 'Conspiracy Theories' and am too not interested in many, just solely interested in the truth. Actually, you'll be surprised to know David Icke always talks about infinite awareness, infinite love, the nature of reality etc before any of the conspiracy stuff, hopefully he will get a lot of his readers interested in spirituality. He often talks about the solution being raising our consciousness and awakening, he even has done Psychedelics a few times
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I am aware of his work.
</p>

<p>
	David Icke is not Awake and he does not embody Love or the highest Truth.
</p>

<p>
	He has some half-assed understanding of how reality works, filtered through his own biases and lack of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Just because he talks about consciousness or love does not mean he really understands how they work.
</p>

<p>
	I find his work to be corrupting the minds of people who should be focused on learning how to Love.
</p>

<p>
	David Icke feeds peoples' base fears. You are not going to awaken that way or become a happy loving person.

<p>
	It's not useless.
</p>

<p>
	I'm just trying to get you to deeply question why you're doing things.
</p>

<p>
	If after deep questioning you decide it's the right thing for you to do, then do it.
</p>

<p>
	I am just offering a new perspective you may not have considered before.
</p>

<p>
	There are many ways to improve body awareness like Tai Chi, yoga, sports, dance, etc.

<p>
	If you guys continue posting these conspiracy theories here you will force me to ban you. This is a misuse of the mind and not in line with the epistemic work we set out to do here.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful watching all the toxic and conspiratorial videos on YT. You are going down toxic rabbit holes which will take you away from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	This is not the forum for such things.
</p>

<p>
	I don't fear the corona virus. Just talking about basic precautions that save lives.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful getting wrapped up in these conspiratorial and cynical ideologies. They are not the way to Truth and Love.

<p>
	This question is still being asked from fear. You are looking for an answer at the level of survival while the real answer is at the level of metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	Have the courage to not feed this fear-based scenario.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine instead that you are such a good person that no one wants to attack you. And if they do, you will be calm enough to endure it. And if they kill you, you will die happy.
</p>

<p>
	After all, even if you are Connor McGregor, I can still just shoot you with a taser and slit your throat with zero training.
</p>

<p>
	You can NEVER win the battle of securing yourself. That's what the wise understand. So they give up that fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	The irony, as with guns, is that you are much more likely to get damaged by your martial training than getting attacked on the street while defenseless.

<p>
	One bad flip or punch can give your brain damage or ruin your spine. And you will be doing thousands of them in training.

<p>
	But you ain't there. We are trying to guide you there. You won't get there by being stuck in fear.
</p>

<p>
	Going defenseless is a great spiritual practice. Is there risk? Of course. That's the point! You consciously bite that bullet.

			I can't stop laughing!!!!!!!
		</p>

		<p>
			So what now? I still want to practice martial arts and to spar. My motivation for it has turned from self-defense and ego preservation and having a strong body and basing my ego off of being disciplined and resilient (when i was 15)  to doing it for beauty, beauty of a strong body, beauty of the range of motion and flexibility a strong body can do (look how beautiful the gymnastic movements are). Also, dueling is beautiful and I feel that it's going to propel me into deeper states of consciousness in the long run. My being craves for the <span>ritualized death of a fight. I want to be put on the line and fight for my life. I also want to get beat, I haven't felt pain in a long time. I feel that getting beat up will allow me to start experiencing life more fully, like a reset on a faulty hardware. Fighting is an expression of my masculinity which I feel inside all of my pores and crave it. Ultimately, it's for consciousness and beauty, and it's out of love. </span>
		</p>

		<p>
			<span>I don't consider it that low consciousness if you approach it in this Fight Club-esque fashion. Of course a machine elf wouldn't be doing any of that, but I'm human. </span>
		</p>

		<p>
			Yes there are higher things in life to do! I still can't meditate all day though. I am a guy with a strong masculine essence and martial arts are part of my physical training.

<p>
	Do what you gotta do. Burn through whatever karma you feel you must burn through.
</p>

<p>
	But you are not human.
</p>

<p>
	I am not here to judge you. I'm just pointing out a higher possibility of who you can be. If you want to master punching creatures in the face, go for it. But try to understand why that looks silly from my POV.
</p>

<p>
	What if you mastered love instead?

	He's certain no Bernie. But then again, even if Bernie had won it's not like his progressive agenda would get fully implemented.

	Biden is a vanilla status quo liberal. I don't think he's as bad as progressives paint him to be. Although like he said, "Nothing will fundamentally change." He will make moderate improvements on the edges. He will not fix deep structural issues.

		<p>
			Did you not pay attention in 2016? Do you not remember Project Veritas and all their revelations of shit that goes on behind the scenes? The Clinton Emails? Or how the super delegates declared Clinton the victor in states before the people even voted? Or is that conspiracy theory to you?

</blockquote>

<p>
	Bernie wasn't shafted by the media in 2016. The media simply didn't take him seriously because there was no reason for them to expect Bernie to have any chance of winning. I didn't take Bernie seriously in 2016 because in 2016 Bernie was a nobody and a total long-shot. Bernie himself didn't seriously think he'd win. You are confusing the media's lack of vision for corruption, but these are very different things. Of course the media lacks progressive vision and they will not go all-in on an unknown candidate with an unproven ability to win. The media underestimated Trump for this reason too. They simply lack vision and deep analysis.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the DNC did some scheming against Bernie -- but again... that's not simply because they are evil but because they didn't think Bernie had a chance of winning. In a sense it would be irresponsible for them to allow a relative nobody to take the nomination away from a mega-celebrity like Clinton.
</p>

<p>
	It's not a conspiracy theory, it's just ignorance about how politics works. Politics involves strategy and scheming. It's a Game of Thrones situation.

<p>
	Again, there are many degrees of democracy.

<p>
	Yes, there is plenty of corruption and plenty room for improvement. But it's a mistake to explain Bernie's loss in 2020 as a function of corruption. The reality is that he's too progressive for most Americans. He did not lose all those states due to corruption. Bernie is simply not viable in the South, and that's a large chunk of the country which you are discounting. Their votes also matter in a democracy.

<p>
	I think the "socialist" label hurts Bernie a lot.

<p>
	It's especially stupid given that he's not really a socialist.

<p>
	But he's been using that label for a long time. I don't see how he could have backpedaled on it and maintained his integrity.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest things I would change about his campaign is to stop talking about socialism. We are not going to have socialism in America for at least 100 years, so forget about it. Socialism is a red herring here. Just talk about improving the system and people will be on board.

<p>
	What are you complaining about? Bernie had a fair chance. He lost. Democratically. Which means not enough people voted for him.
</p>

<p>
	That's free choice.
</p>

<p>
	When you cry "free choice", be careful not to confuse that with "the choice I want". A democracy does not guarantee that your choice will be the majority's choice.
</p>

<p>
	Nobody stole the election from Bernie. Simply not enough citizens agreed with Bernie's message. Because most American citizens are not progressive stage Green socialists.

<p>
	Military and police is mostly Blue. Although some Red in there for sure. Red people would gravitate towards such roles and it can be problematic when the military or police start acting out in Red fashion.
</p>

<p>
	There was a story recently of how US Navy Seals reported one of their own Seals for basically torturing and killing civilians in Iraq because the dude was toxic Red. And Trump pardoned the guy and invited him to the White House! Because Trump doesn't see a problem with Red behavior as long as it's "our guys" doing it in the name of America.
</p>

<p>
	A healthy stage Blue solider will be careful not to harm civilians or abuse his power.

	That's right. Luckily we are way past stage Red society in developed countries.

<p>
	Reality is a tautology. It cannot be anything other than what it is.

<p>
	It would delusional of me to judge or reject Michael Jordan, Connor McGregor, Floyd Mayweather, Adolf Hitler, or Osama bin Laden -- as I would be rejecting myself.

<p>
	It is all Love.
</p>

<p>
	But question is, what are you gonna do about it? Whatever you decide to do will be how reality must be and that will be Love. Because you are God creating yourself. There are no limits on your creation. You can create heaven or hell.

<p>
	Yes, brutal. Ape-like. That's was my only point. It is the behavior of an ape. You are turning apery into an artform! Lol
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate deeper WHY fighting is a part of human culture at all. Where did you even get the idea that fighting ought to be mastered, or that it's noble? Why do you buy into this idea?
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a civilization in which people flung shit at each other, but they turned it into a highly refined artform. They would smell and taste the shit like fine wine. Then they would perfect their flinging technique. They would get all acrobatic with it and teach their children to do it to instill discipline and other fine values. They would have shit flinging dojos and televise it on pay per view. They would have the world's biggest podcaster narrate the art of flinging shit in between tokes of DMT <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" /> And their children would see all this and say, "Daddy, when I grow up, I want to the world's greatest shit flinger." And daddy would proudly say with a tear in his eye, "That's my boy!"
</p>

<p>
	If you met a DMT machine elf, do you think that guy would be devoting thousands of hours to master fighting other living beings?
</p>

<p>
	Can you see how absurd that notion is from a higher consciousness being's POV? It's as absurd as engineering nuclear weapons.
</p>

<p>
	It's like if you invested thousands of hours collecting shoelaces. Nothing wrong with that, per se. But there are higher things to do in life, assuming you are conscious enough of course. If you have the consciousness of an ape, then mastering apery looks good to you.
</p>

<p>
	It is challenging at times.
</p>

<p>
	But the hardest part is handling being disconnected from God consciousness. Once you get high enough, being off 5-MeO-DMT is the hard part.

	Turquoise is not a premeditated choice. It's what you must become if you are conscious enough. Think of it as your destiny. There is no choice about being God and Love. That's what you are.

			Have you known anyone to puke, or fall into a deep depression followed by 5Meo? Also are people highly vocal and loud during?

</blockquote>

<p>
	Puking will definitely happen if you don't trip on an empty stomach. But I have not puked in over 100 trips because I observe proper protocol.
</p>

<p>
	People fall into depression and have ego backlash for all sorts of reasons unrelated to 5-MeO-DMT. Any serious spiritual work can bring that about.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, expect some ego backlash if you trip deep.
</p>

<p>
	I have never been loud. Nor has anyone I've trip-sat. But of course some people will kick and scream.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Look at your paranoia.
</p>

<p>
	If Bill Gates wanted to be a power-hungry psychopath, he could easily do so given his resources, and his work and influence would look very different. He could easily be a tyrant or a James Bond villian.
</p>

<p>
	But here is a guy who devoted the remainder of his life to helping mankind, and you call him a psychopath. That's like spitting in God's face.
</p>

<p>
	You can question the capitalist political system which under-taxes billionaires, but when a billionaire acts for the benefit of powerless people, don't bite his hand. People are not bad for being billionaires. It's how they use their money and power after they get it that matters.
</p>

<p>
	Bill Gates warned about coronavirus some years ago. While you were at home watching Netflix and jerking off, he was working hard to make sure your mom doesn't die of a pandemic. Yet he is the psychopath. Lol
</p>

<p>
	If Bill Gates wanted to, he could have supermodels riding his dick 365 days of the year and feeding him grapes. Yet he works every day to help under-developed countries fight diseases. Think about that.
</p>

			This sounds all nice and good but isnt this just basic nonduality 101? I mean everything is an illusion is not a new teaching, it's pretty basic stuff. It's as old as spirituality. I doubt budhha was not aware of this.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also I have a question, why are you not aware of the things that these great masters talk about like other realms, angels, demons, disembodied beings, celestial beings, different universes, different dimensions, past lives etc many more things that they speak of like 84th universe. Why are you not become aware of any of these things in your trips?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	First of all, I have become aware of some of those things and so do others when they trip.
</p>

<p>
	But more importantly, all of those things are still imaginary (since all form is imaginary).
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Consciousness is higher than all those things.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality has many degrees to it. It all sounds the same but one's consciousness of it can go deeper and deeper.

<p>
	If this was true, you'd be a slave right now living under a tyranical king. Or even more likely you'd be dead.
</p>

<p>
	Equality comes in many, many degrees. 10,000 years of human history is nothing but a record of the successes of equality over inequality. See the big picture. Evolution moves towards greater unity and love.

<p>
	Of course she will resist it. It would be a huge blow to her ego.
</p>

<p>
	That's why I said, "get her to contemplate". She has to want to think through this topic rather than acting out an ideology. This requires an open mind and genuine desire for a deeper understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Since she's in stage Blue/Orange, what she needs is all the stuff required to advance to Green. See my SD videos for tips on how to advance from Orange to Green. It will take her about 5 years, assuming she is serious about growth. Which it sounds like she isn't, in which case, never.
</p>

<p>
	Open her mind to the idea of growth.

<p>
	God has "killed" itself when you were born. That's what you are: God not realizing it is God. Your human birth was God's termination of itself.
</p>

<p>
	But this is only an imaginary termination of course. God cannot actually end itself because it is endless and exists in all places, so it has no place to go. Death/termination/birth is imagined by God. So God is prior to it.
</p>

<p>
	Death is purely imaginary. Like in a video game. Can Mario ever die? How many lives does Mario have?

<p>
	Precisely because if it wasn't you would go insane and there would be no "reality".
</p>

<p>
	A good story needs consistency.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to deconstruct because if you deconstruct it you'd be fucking dead. This isn't a game. Your whole life hinges on your memory. Even an "enlightened master" needs to remember his address.

<p>
	Flinging shit is also love and beautiful.
</p>

<p>
	But a conscious being has better things to do than fling shit.
</p>

<p>
	MMA is barbaric. And in a few hundred years people will look back at it and gasp at the barbarism the way we do today with slavery or rape.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't deny its artistry. You can turn rape into an artform. But a conscious person wouldn't.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a civilization that had rape on pay per view and each rape victim earned ten million dollars per rape.

	You would never do MMA if you reached a higher level of consciousness.

	I have an automated system that backs up all my computers daily to a local 40TB NAS storage unit which has a raid array.
</p>

<p>
	You can buy small automated external drives which connect to your local network. Do some research. It's pretty easy to set up these days.
</p>

<p>
	Or if you are cheap and lazy, cloud.

<title>Does the upper class benefit from socialized programs?</title>

<p>
	All this misses the point. The real point is to get your mother to contemplate what it would be like if she reincarnated and lived life as every member of society. So in the next life she will not be a successful business person but a poor immigrant with bad genetics, bad childhood, and a chronic disease.
</p>

<p>
	Your mother's business success is not merely a function of hard work. That success is built on a foundation which your mother is not in control of: genetics, place of birth, parents, good health, favorable economic system, etc. She takes all that for granted by assuming that all people in society are like her. Well, they aren't. Not even close. Imagine if her child had an incurable lifelong disease which forced her into bankrupcy and homelessness.
</p>

<p>
	That's exactly right, she is denying responsibility for being a member of society. It's to say that others aren't working hard enough when work comes easily to you and you benefit in a thousand other ways. Her success is the result of society. It is not her own.
</p>

You ain't ever gonna find a "thing" behind the eyes. All you will find is degrees of emptiness. And emptiness is not behind the eyes, it is equally in all places, since it is nowhere.

It depends a lot on you. It's a good idea to be open to exploring various methods to find those which resonate with you. Allow this to be a process of discovery and experimentation, that way you can stumble upon new stuff, new methods, new teachers, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will give you some solid glimpses but they will not be enough by themselves to embody awakening. You will need some manual practices. Developing your concentration ability is crucial. It think this holds people back the most. They can't focus the mind long enough to awaken.

</p>

<p>
	The point of meditation, contemplation, yoga, self-inquiry is to develop very strong concentration ability which is necessary to break through.
</p>

<p>
	Concentration is the key. It changes your state of consciousness when done rigorously and for long periods of time. Psychedelics make concentration much easier. Otherwise you gonna have to train your ass off manually.
</p>

<p>
	Questioning beliefs is good, but it won't be enough by itself. Your state of consciousness has to change.

<p>
	No, all imagination and division comes to an end sooner or later and ends in Oneness/Truth. Dreams are always temporary.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not imagined. The dream is imagined. Awakening is beyond that.

</p>

<p>
	You are not going to be meditative all day long while doing everyday tasks without decades of serious training.
</p>

<p>
	Either limit your meditation to short but rigorous daily sessions, or do a full 10 day retreat. Otherwise you will be half-assing it and get nowhere. Effective meditation requires rigor.

	Hypnosis is real and it can be powerful when done by a master.

<p>
	As far as videos go, of course those can be fake or exaggerted to gain views. As always, the more popular a thing is, the more dumb it tends to be.

<p>
	He spent decades building up to that point.

<p>
	Lower your dose to 2g and CONTEMPLATE! It's not about quantity, it's about how you use it.

	You're not a person at all. You are God/Love/Consciousness/Everything which has confused itself for a person.
</p>

<p>
	It is okay to be however you are and it is okay to make mistakes in life. Don't be so hard on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Self-Love is the ultimate teaching.

<p>
	You are overlooking how relative this is.
</p>

<p>
	There is far more racism and opression in less developed countries. A country doesn't need to be perfect to be developed. If you think the racism in the US is bad, you're overlooking how bad it is elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
	Democracies are not dissolving, they are getting stronger via temporary struggle. The US is more democratic now than its ever been.

<p>
	God IS Love, so it already accepts itself as that. You just require more consciousness of yourself as That.

<p>
	You are only "alone" because you are ONE with all things and others. Don't overlook that.

<p>
	It can, assuming you are willing. But if you are stubborn, then that is your karma and you are stuck until such time that you surrender your stubbornness.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, karma is nothing other than your unwillingness to surrender.

	You can change them to whatever labels you resonate with, as long as it stays true to the original meaning.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	You must dive deep into whatever color stage you are still struggling with.
</p>

<p>
	You can't be solid Green until you exhaust Orange. Become so Orange that you get sick of it. Then you will be truely ready for Green.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, that's what Elliot Hulse is doing. He's playing through Blue and Orange. Burning through his karma to someday reach Green. If he ever reaches Green in this lifetime he'll see how silly and dysfunctional his rants about sluts and sexual purity were. But he needs to go through these rants to purify himself. So what you're seeing in his videos is his growing up process.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is that he is dragging his followers along with him into the dysfunction. But he can't help it. So here we are.

	You're not going to stop people from eating meat in our lifetime. It's too deeply embedded in our culture.

<p>
	It is more practical to invent lab grown meat.

	Seems like you are still resisting and have surrender and integration work to do.
</p>

<p>
	You can just lower your doses and keep integrating each trip until you stop being scared of them.
</p>

<p>
	If there is fear, there is work left to do.
