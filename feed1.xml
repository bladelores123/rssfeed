	The data pretty clearly shows that Scandinavian countries have the highest levels of happiness, health, and overall well-being of all the nations.
</p>

<p>
	So clearly their Social Dem systems are the best mankind has invented so far. They seem to strike a good balance between capitalism and socialism.

<p>
	I was sorta forced into it because of my health problems. So I'm not a good measure of such things. I was forced to explore many supplements I otherwise never would.
</p>

<p>
	If your health is good, then it probably won't be worth it for you. And it also depends very much on your salary. I have money to burn.

<p>
	God is the realization that there is no self, or that the Self is infinite, rather than some limited form.
</p>

<p>
	It's very much like realizing you aren't human but the entire universe.

			Maybe my flavour of nonduality is a bit different, and probably more escapist if I have to be honest.

<p>
	All colors, sounds, sensations, feelings, tastes, smells = raw data
</p>

<p>
	It's the most fundamental stuff of which reality is made of. These are the true "atoms". You can't boil down the color red any further than itself. You can't boil down the taste of salt any further than itself.

<p>
	Yes, of course! Money is super important if you are building out your life purpose / biz / career. Money is what allows you to avoid becoming some devil boss's bitch slave.
</p>

<p>
	I take money very seriously, even though it's not important in the absolute sense. You should be very prudent and strategic about money. Not to buy toys, but as a resource to enable your creativity. I am very pragmatic about money. You need it and it's not some evil thing. When you set up your LP correctly, money becomes a reflection of your creative output and service to the world.
</p>

<p>
	Here's how you should think about money:

			He seems very action-oriented to me and like he's able to utilize Red aspects to get out of trouble, and use his courage, warrior spirit, and audacity; like he did in this video with Jabba.. Jabba had him surrounded but he acted so cool and like he didn't care at all.  Like fighting, escaping and out-flying others.   It's like that Indiana Jones type of adventurous warrior spirit... lots of action, daring, fighting, etc.  Not too well thought out...  Would you not say those are healthy aspects of Red being put to use?

<p>
	Han has some Red, but I'd say his center of gravity is more Orange.
</p>

<p>
	In the first Star Wars movie Han's entire character arc was about him going from Orange to Green. He was this selfish, independent jackass who was too self-centered to join the rebels, and at the last second he changes his mind and flys in to save Luke from Vader's tie-fighter, enabling Luke to make his shot and destroy the Death Star.
</p>

<p>
	So, basically, Han Solo's story is that of a selfish jackass who had a change of heart and became an SJW.

</p>

<p>
	It's amazing how conservatives can love Star Wars and yet not get that the entire movie is about being a SJW.

<p>
	Of course it's all a matter of perspective.
</p>

<p>
	There's not some objective solution to such issues. It's all perspectival, relative, and contingent on one's survival agenda.

<p>
	YES! But it's not a space. It is nowhere. Nowhere is the perciever/subject. But notice, this now creates a new duality: nowhere (space) vs the stuff in it. So this is not yet full nonduality. For full nonduality you must realize that all the form is itself identical to the "space" in which it occurs. If you are distinguishing space from its contents, that is still duality.
</p>

<p>
	In the final awakening you must realizing that absolute indifference between form and formlessness.

<p>
	No-self = True Self
</p>

<p>
	When everything collapses into ONE, there are no more parts. Your mind is trying to grasp at parts but Unity cannot have any. That's why this is so confusing for you. You are trying to grasp Infinity using the mind but that cannot ever work because the mind itself is entangled with the question. There cannot even be 1) a mind, and 2) a thing which the mind grasps. Since that is still duality.
</p>

<p>
	Things ARE mind!
</p>

<p>
	The chair is not happening in the mind. The chair IS mind. The end.

<p>
	Nope, that won't work. If only it were so easy. People are not going to wake up in large numbers in a libertarian society. Waking up large numbers of people will require serious infrastructure and communal effort.
</p>

<p>
	In a libertarian society, devils and egos will run amok and prevent most people from waking up because they will have to be constantly working to protect themselves from the machinations of the devils. Exactly what we have in America today.
</p>

<p>
	Waking up lots of people requires infrastructure for consciousness.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Except there is.
</p>

<p>
	Most women are still highly attracted to masculine guys. So, for example, if a guy wants to get laid by hot girls, then working on his masculinity is important. Otherwise he might end up an angsty, suicidal Incel who shoots up a school.
</p>

<p>
	And there are many other such cases.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, these are very complex survival functions so your mind is not likely to just invent a better alternative.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, gender roles are outdated. And, no, gender roles are not outdated, they are still valuable for most guys and girls. Both things are true at once.

<p>
	In a sense yes. But also consider that they would all perfectly cancel each other out.
</p>

<p>
	You do not necessarily need to display every image on a screen in order to realize that the screen can display an endless number of images. A screen of infinite dimensions could display infinite images. But that doesn't mean it will or that it has to. It could. But it could also just sit back and bask its pure potential without rendering anything at all. The blank screen is still infinite. It's just not expressing itself in an single way. Which you could say, is it's "truest" form. In it's purest form God is pure potential without any need to bias itself towards any one form or experience. God could sit back and not dream anything at all. It gets to decide what it wants.
</p>

<p>
	It's better that you don't think of Infinite Consciousness as merely an endless list of items. It's far more profound than that.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Anything that has form will be limited by tautology. You can't be in a human body/mind and know every atom in the material universe because your brain/mind can only handle so much data at once.
</p>

<p>
	My deepest experiences of Infinity are of a pure, formless singularity which is perfectly self-knowing without anything hidden from itself. But part of the reason that's possible is because it's simple. It's not a bunch of data, it's more like a single, infinitely self-interconnected point.

<p>

<p>
	It's hard to say because it all depends on you. People react differently to chemicals. You'll have to try many things until you find one that works for you.

<p>
	It is definitely not accessible to all minds. Consciousness is capable of getting itself stuck in cul de sacs, at least until death.
</p>

<p>
	Think of a little child in a Nazi concentration camp being herded into a gas chamber. How free is that child to stop imagining the hell it is in? Not free at all.
</p>

<p>
	But assuming decent environmental conditions and healthy brain neurology, you can direct your mind. Which is what all spiritual work is about in some sense.

<p>
	Yes, red exists Absolutely. All the raw data you see around you exists as an absolute. The problem is that when ego looks at anything absolute, it contextualizes it as "my subjective experiences". But without an ego, your experiences would stop being "yours" and they would even stop being "human experience happening in a brain".
</p>

<p>
	"These are my subjective human experiences" << is a conceptual context which the ego-mind projects/imagines in order to create a sense of self.

	Go re-watch my videos on What Is Perception? and What Is Actuality? and What Is Truth?

<p>
	It's all explained there.

	Or just take a psychedelic and see it for yourself.

<p>
	You need to buy a large bag of slippery elm powder. Like a half pound bag. And you mix a couple tablespoons of it with a hot cup of water. Stir it around and it will get thick and slimy like snot. Then drink it.

<title>Gender Change VS Gender Deconstruction</title>

<p>
	Much in our world is socially constructed, but don't forget, that doesn't mean we can or should change it willy-nilly. Social constructions have a certain utilitarian function, which is why they were constructed in the first place. Most social constructions have also survived a long evolutionary process of trail and error and optimization, which means it's unlikely that you will just invent something better from your single small mind.
</p>

<p>
	The logic goes a bit like this: We can all agree that the walls of your house were constructed, but that doesn't mean it is wise to demolish them, as the roof will collapse on your head.
</p>

<p>
	To re-architect a complex thing requires deep intelligence and solid system's thinking. Re-architecting something as time-tested as gender roles is not as easy or harmless as some utopian stage Green folks would like to believe. You can do it, but what will be the down-range consequences?
</p>

			It looks like we have found a distinction within omniscience. I’m talking about it by the definition of having all knowledge. Do you believe all knowledge is an aspect of God? You’ve mentioned it being an aspect in one of your God for smart people videos. It seems like here you are equating high consciousness of what is immediately present with omniscience. Unless you’re using a new definition, which it appears you are, this would not serve as omniscience. It seems like you are arguing against the validity of the traditional concept of omniscience. <br />
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			If omniscience is not real, then that makes this whole thread rather useless. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is no way you will understand or appreciate what omniscience truly means until you experience it.
</p>

<p>
	Omniscience is not what normies think it is. The normie notion of omniscience is similar to the normie notion of God. It's very off-the-mark from the actual thing.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I'm using a new definition which comes from a direct experience of omniscience. Omniscience is NOT at the level of human knowledge. True omniscience cuts through all that conceptual human BS. For example, with true omniscience, rather than knowing what your mom ate for lunch today, you will be directly conscious that your mom and her lunch are imaginary. This is far more powerful than knowing what she has for lunch because her having lunch is still within the delusional frame of Maya. True omniscience cuts through Maya like a razor. It is pure 100% NOW-ness. Time and space and others do not exist there because they have been cut through.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is capable of being FULLY, TOTALLY conscious of every aspect of itself. Whether you ever reach such consciousness sober, is another matter. I highly doubt it. Omniscience is way beyond what typical nondual teachers talk about or have ever experienced. Mooji or Tolle will not lead you to omniscience.

<p>
	You can certainly dream up and experience a classic version of Christian hell. Not just one hell, but an infinite different kinds of hell. Some with demons, others without, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	But just because you CAN do that, doesn't mean you will or have to.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to take responsibility for the shit you're dreaming up. If you start imagining demons every day, over and over again, yeah... they will start to become a part of your reality.
</p>

<p>
	The cure to all this is to realize, "Oh yeah! I'm imagining all this and I have some say in what I would prefer to imagine."
</p>

<p>
	If you don't like hell, then stop creating it!
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Perception isn't direct because it is dualistic. "Perception" is a very loaded word here. You have to understand that when he says that perception isn't direct, he does NOT mean that you will discover some new thing behind perception, like some sort of "truer" version of reality. What he means is, everything will stay the same, but you will realize that perception is actually Being by collapsing the subject of perception into the raw data of perception. Perception will get radically recontextualized, but all the raw data, so to speak, will stay exactly the same. If you saw red before, you will keep seeing red during awakening. But now red will be recognized as RED! -- an absolute, rather than a function of some biological human brain process.
</p>

<p>
	I explain all this very well in my videos: What Is Perception? and What Is Actuality?
</p>

<p>
	Being = perception minus ego
</p>

<p>
	RED = red minus a perceiver
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that there can be healthy ways to express Red animalistic impulses in harmless ways. For example, playing a violent video game could a healthy way for kids to experience their Red shadow without hurting anyone and ultimately outgrowing the desire for violence. This, as opposed to kids who start fist-fights at school.

			How can omniscience exist without all things existing at least at some point in time? If at least one partitioned consciousness of God didn’t experience a kangaroo killing Donald Trump with a flamethrower, would it really be omniscient if that is a possibility fully able to be dreamed up by consciousness/God/you? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't think that's particularly necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Omniscience is simply full consciousness of the present moment. Other moments don't need to happen because they are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You can be conscious that reality is an infinite dream without having to dream all the possible dreams. Similar to how you can be conscious that numbers are endless without having to write out every number.
</p>

<p>
	1, 2, 3, 4.... at some point you just get that it can go on forever.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, there is a tradeoff between infinite consciousness and form. To truly be infinitely conscious you will just become an undifferentiated singularity. There will be no forms there, but you will be totally conscious of everything that could ever be.
</p>

<p>
	That is the pure white light at the end of tunnel that some people report to see when they die. It feels like getting sucked into the center of the sun. It's so much consciousness that it has infinite brightness and all form just drowns in it. Imagine a white hole that is infinitely deep.

<p>
	It's mostly rhetorical confusion.
</p>

<p>
	The word experience is used for lack of a better word. Technically experience is dualiatic because it implies an experiencer. When the expeirence and expeirencer merge into one, what remains is Being, which is Absolute Truth. But it looks just like experience.
</p>

<p>
	The way Ralston frames it is needlessly confusing.
</p>

<p>
	What is really being pointed to is experience minus the experiencer.
</p>

<p>
	Teachers use the same words in different ways.

<p>
	If she is so delusional, then why even think about her? Move on to things which have significance.
</p>

<p>
	I don't even take socialists seriously in America. True socialism will not happen in America in our lifetime, if ever. It's radically impractical at this time and people are not ready for it.

<p>
	First, we must achieve true democracy. What we have now is a mockery of democracy. America is a plutocracy for all practical purposes.
</p>

<p>
	The reason those philosophers didn't like democracy was because most people in their age were illiterate dumb farmers.

Although I would add, all of that is occurring in YOUR/GOD'S consciousness. You are seeing that YOU/CONSCIOUSNESS has the potential for infinite dreams.

</p>

<p>
	Analogous to what you said above about dosing, you can plug as high a dose as you want until you pass out. It's not like plugging is limited in potency. It's just gonna be a smoother and longer trip rather than a sledgehammer to the head.
</p>

<p>
	To me the biggest downside of vaped DMT is how short and jarring the trip is. If I could plug DMT, I would. I only vape it because plugged doesn't work. And also vaping is bad for your lungs.
</p>

<p>
	I never have a problem with my 5-MeO-DMT trips being too weak. Not once have I come back from a 5-MeO-DMT trip and been like: "Well, that was nice, but I wish it was stronger and hit me 10x faster for 1/5th the time." Even plugged 5-MeO-DMT is too short for the kind of work we're interested in here. We want trips that are 3-4 hours long. Vaping that much DMT wears out my lungs.

	Consciousness can dream up whatever it wants, including your pearly gated heaven. But that doesn't necessarily mean it exists "out there" somewhere in the ether. For it to exist, YOU must dream it up right now.
</p>

<p>
	What exists is whatever you put in your consciousness.

Don't pin your life's work on any single thing. You want to start feeling the emotional payoff for your work by doing small projects and getting fan's reactions.

	Don't sit back and hope for the world to become conscious some day. Roll up your sleeves and get to work making it more conscious.

<p>
	This is not a problem, this is an opportunity for you to shine.

<p>
	As you get engaged in life purpose work, your feelings of not being understood will start to become irrelevant as your work will reach out and touch thousands of people.

<p>
	Yes, this is all about how you carry yourself and make your approach. There are right and wrong ways to approach and set the proper first impression.
</p>

<p>
	You need to make sure your body language is non-threatening. You also need to be very chill and casual about it. You need to start off immediately by treating her as your girlfriend, not as a stranger. Whatever you feel will transfer onto her. If you are nervous, she will be nervous. If you feel awkward, she will feel awkward.
</p>

<p>
	After I stop her, the first thing I do is I immediately say something to take the edge off. Something like, "Hey, I know this seems random and weird, but I just saw you and thought you were cute. Don't worry, I'm not crazy or anything." And then YOU must carry the conversation. Don't just stop a girl cold and then look at her silently, expecting her to carry the conversation. You gotta start moving your mouth and engage her attention with interesting talk, not awkward silence nor peppering her with boring questions.
</p>

<p>
	It's also super-important that you SMILE on open. Be smiley.
</p>

<p>
	If you open her without smiling, that's your #1 mistake.
</p>

<title>psychedelics hangover</title>

<p>
	Yes, I have noticed that mushrooms and some 4-HO sub-type tryptamines give me a hangover the next day, while other psychedelics do not.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO has no hangover effects at all for me. Neither does DMT from what I recall although I'm less sure about DMT since I've done a lot less of it.
</p>

<p>
	You could experiment with various nootropic supplements or vitamins on the day after to see if they might take the edge off. I get the sense that the brain might simply be lacking nutrients the day after which were used up the day before. If you could supplement that lacking nutrient, theoretically you could stop the hangover.
</p>

<p>
	Let us know if you find something.
</p>

<p>
	Try drinking Slippery Elm bark every day for a few months.
</p>

<p>
	There are other natural supplements along those lines you should try out. Search online to find em.
</p>

<p>
	Also try juicing. Juicing seems to be power for healing gut issues. A huge glass of celery juice every morning. And you can try other juices too. Try that for a month at least.
</p>

<p>
	Also get tested for candida and other bacteria/parasites.
</p>

<p>
	Comprehensive stool testing can be important in this case. You can order test kits like this:

<p>
	That will depend on what kind of person you are. Some folks are more insiders, others are more suited to be outsiders.
</p>

<p>
	I'm a strong outsider because I'm very clear in my vision and very independent. Collaboration isn't my cup of tea.
</p>

<p>
	But your personality might be the opposite.

<p>
	I'm speculating here, but I think what was really going on was that Jerry was cheating on his wife for years and as a way to compensate they came to this arrangement of an open marriage where each would sleep around with whoever they wanted, but maintain the appearance of a traditional marriage because, hey, gotta keep up those good ol Christian family values.
</p>

<p>
	I get the sense that their marriage became stale and died long ago, and they just never got divorced because it was too convenient to officially be together.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sure we'll hear more stories in the future about who Jerry was banging behind the scenes while all this was going on.

	Lots of stuff is a social construct but that doesn't mean it is readily changed.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck getting guys to wear high heels.
</p>

<p>
	Language is one of the most socially constructed things there is. And yet, it's hard to get people to change their vocabulary.

Maybe 5-10% will skew in quirky directions, but most will be happy being more masculine and more feminine.

<p>
	Ah... but it's not so simple.
</p>

<p>
	So long as you are in that physical body, you will have a strong identification with your sex. Sex is a deep physiological aspect of what you are as a human on the relative plane. And this cannot be changed willy-nilly. The hormones running your brain and body play a HUGE role in shaping your raw experience of life, not to mention your thoughts and emotions.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not as easy as having robots do all our physical labor for us.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to completely decouple gender and sex, you'll have to become like a brain in a vat hooked up to some VR game. Or via genetic engineering. But assuming your genes stay that same, you'll have attachments to masculine and feminine qualities.
</p>

	There actually is no such thing as POVs. There is only your direct experience. All POVs are inside your POV.

	Gender is just an aspect of self-identity/ego.
</p>

<p>
	And all identity is relative & imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You could identify with being a unicorn and no one could stop you as long as you believed in it hard enough.
</p>

<p>
	After all, that's exactly what you're doing right now when you identify as a human.
</p>

<p>
	"Human" is a totally imaginary identity.

<p>
	Since Love is absolute, everything that happens is already in the service of Love. So you have no choice in the matter. Whatever you do will increase Love in the world. The more evil you become the more Love your evilness with spawn in response.

<p>
	If you take responsibility for this situation you can socialize with 30 single women in one weekend. Thus increasing your odds of finding the right girl by a factor 30, 50, or 100!
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate how HUGE that is. Imagine x100 fold increase. This is relatively easy to create simply by going out every Fri, Sat, Sun. It's that simple to get a x100 increase. And we haven't even talked about upgrading your skills yet. With upgraded skills you will get another x100 increase.

<p>
	It's not only a numbers game, but when the numbers aren't in your favor you're setting yourself up for failure.
</p>

<p>
	If you were a real estate agent and you only talked to 30 people in 3 months, your children would starve, no matter how good of an agent you were. Being good at real estate requires constantly getting new leads and socializing and meeting dozens of new people every week. Same when dating.
</p>

<p>
	It's not only numbers, but numbers matter a lot. And this actually works in your favor because you can control numbers pretty directly.
</p>

<p>
	You can increase your numbers by x100 starting next week.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Social anxiety can have multiple root causes, some of which might be deep inner trauma which requires doing some inner work. But this is all a big part of pickup work. Pickup is not just about going out every night. It is also very much about correcting your poor inner game, poor mindsets, limiting beliefs, low self-esteem, bad habits, etc. There is a huge psychological component to getting good with women and becoming a strong, confident man. But all that inner game stuff will never be enough if you don't socialize.
</p>

<p>
	You must do BOTH! Inner game and outer game. You must do psychotherapy-type work on your limiting beliefs and low self-esteem AND you must hit the bars and clubs every weekend.
</p>

<p>
	The two synergize, creating an upward spiral.
</p>

<p>
	Incels create a downward spiral by never going out and then creating a toxic ideology to rationalize why going out is pointless and why no girl will like them. This is a toxic cancer of the mind which creates as self-fulfilling prophecy.

<p>
	You can change all those pathways because your brain and mind are plastic. That's the whole point of our work here! Everything about you can change!
</p>

<p>
	If you can change your brain to stop constructing ego, you can also change it to be good at socializing.

<p>
	If you want to have sex, you need to socialize a lot more frequently and it will happen. Even without pickup skillz. That is how normies get laid. Normies tend to be fairly social.
</p>

<p>
	The Incel phenomenon is gaining steam so much these days because of the rise of the internet and gaming. Real-world socialization has taken a serious hit. You must consciously over-compensate for it nowadays by pushing yourself to socialize in the flesh even though there's little need to do so (other than for getting laid).
</p>

<p>
	And who knows... you might learn to joy it more than playing Fortnite.
</p>

<p>
	It's counter-intuitive: the chasing of bliss is the very thing which prevents it.
</p>

<p>
	Bliss is a consequence of fully facing one's fear and not needing to manipulate your experience.
</p>

<p>
	It's problematic to be doing psychedelics with the expectation of bliss. I would drop that expectation and instead aim for Truth and understanding. Bliss is the fruit off the tree of understanding. Focus on watering the roots of your tree rather than jumping like a thirsty monkey at the unripened green fruits.

	Socializing.

<p>
	You don't have to do cold approach per se, but you must re-design your life so that you have more socialization opportunitues with new people, face to face.
</p>

<p>
	The single biggest problem with Incels is that they simply do not leave their mancaves to socialize with humans in the flesh. They are stuck in an online world, where getting laid is virtually impossible.
</p>

<p>
	But also, keep in mind that there is no easy solution to the problem of finding quality partners/sex. Most humans suffer from this problem, which is why they get married and stay together thru thick and thin.
</p>

<p>
	What must be appreciated is that dating is difficult, period! It takes a lot of energy. If you are too lazy to invest that energy then don't expect results.

<p>
	The general problem of not getting sex is a common frustration for guys and girls alike.
</p>

<p>
	Feeling lonely, feeling unattractive, feeling like you will never find the right partner -- these are probably one of the most common concerns for humans around the world.
</p>

<p>
	But that's not the same as what these online incels are doing.

<p>
	You are looking at this in terms of sex.
</p>

<p>
	The proper way to look at it is in terms of growth.
</p>

<p>
	He's not doing those 1000 approaches to get 1 hot girl. He's doing it to overcome his fears and to develop strength as a man. That development will pay dividends for a lifetime. So it's worth doing even if you only get 1 or 2 lays out of it.
</p>

<p>
	And like I said, result grow exponentally. So the next 1000 appraoches after that could produce 2-4 lays. And the next 1000, 4-8 lays, and the next 1000, 8-16 lays. And by that point you are getting more pussy than most guys can dream of.
</p>

<p>
	Business works the same way. The first few years of starting a biz, you work non-stop but earn nothing.

<p>
	It's more nuanced than that.
</p>

<p>
	Incel has become a label that applies to a very specific, narrow group of online trolls who have invented a victim ideology to justify their inability to get laid. It has become an entire sub-culture / online cult.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not as innocent as random guys who are involuntarily celebate. It has become a toxic identity and worldview.

<p>
	The riots are stopped by police already.
</p>

<p>
	Trump could certainly stop the protests by listening to them and putting forth a solution on police reform and increasing black rights.

<p>
	You're looking at this all wrong.
</p>

<p>
	This is not an experience you want to come in trying to avoid, but fully experience and savor.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with getting shot in the face is that you have no idea how scary and traumatic it can be. You think you are macho enough to handle it, but you probably aren't and will just end up freaking yourself out and never trying again.
</p>

<p>
	Slow and steady wins the race here.
</p>

<p>
	You are never going to out-macho or bull your way through psychedelics. They can always dish out more than you can handle.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to do a lot of day time approaches. Day time approaches have to be much more solid given their rarity. Majority of my approaches were night time. Simply given that, more results will come from night because it is a numbers game.
</p>

<p>
	But my first success was from day.
</p>

<p>
	Day is best, if only you could find enough hot girls during the day. They tend to be very rare and it's not so good for practice. Day is when you have to execute already solid game so it looks smooth and chill and effortless. Night is best for rapid training and fun, and if you want same-night results.

<p>
	Random, but who I found were fairly attractive. I have pretty high standards for what I find attractive. If my standards were lower I would get laid a lot more.

<p>
	One important thing pickup taught me was to significantly lower my standards because they were ridiculously high.

<p>
	You cannot look at awakening as any kind of linear one-dimensional process. This is where this Ramaji stuff becomes delusional.
</p>

<p>
	You are just blindly trusting that these people will deliver you to God. Which is not much different than joining a cult.
</p>

<p>
	You must take responsibility for Truth yourself, not outsource it to someone else.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter how nice or spiritual these people seem. From your POV you don't know what Truth is.

<p>
	That's his problem right there. Pickup has a steep learning curve. Took me 440 approaches to get my first result. But I didn't pay no $8000 for it.

<p>
	If you are a hard case newbie with serious social anxiety issues and deep introversion, you'll need more than 300 approaches to start to see results. But the good news is, your results grow at an exponential rate. The first year is the hardest and driest.

	Of course no amount of meditation or therapy will fix that. She needs to muster the courage to leave her husband.

	That is the elephant in the room. Be ware of using spirituality as a mask for basic material inaction.

<p>
	When it comes to politics you're damned if you do and damned if you don't. Focusing on yourself will allow devils to rule over you.
</p>

<p>
	Engagment is important.
</p>

<p>
	There's really no other option but to work towards social justice and improvement of government.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about you, it's about the future of us. If you are getting into politics with a mindset of "what will I get out of it?" you've missed the point of politics. It's about service and elevating mankind.

<p>
	Of course whenever and wherever a large mob of people arises, some degree of devilry will be done. This is a law of human nature.
</p>

<p>
	But also, when the political system is such that democracy isn't working well because one person one vote is corrupted, then mobs have no choice but to break out.
</p>

<p>
	So the ultimate cause of these mobs is a lack of government responsiveness. If we had better leadership with more compassion, responsiveness, and vision, these mobs wouldn't be necessary and would self-dispurse.
</p>

<p>
	Trump and the Republicans are fueling these mobs by twiddling their thumbs while they look the other way on many popular issues.
</p>

<p>
	Republicans are refusing to take responsibility for these mobs. Instead they demonize them as that is far more convenient.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, we have a double standard here for thoughtfulness vs ignorance/dogma.
</p>

<p>
	You can express conservative positions but you must do so in a thoughtful and non-dogmatic matter. If you are just here parroting pro-Trump talking points you will get banned because we are sick of hearing it and it adds nothing of value to our discussions.
</p>

<p>
	It just so happens that most Trumpists are not very thoughtful -- surprise, surprise. But that's not the Mod's problem.
</p>

<p>
	I am happy to see intelligently expressed conservative positions that make me think well of conservatives. But they tend to be rarer than hen's teeth.

	It's fascinating to watch how conservativism evolves to make itself tennable for younger generations. It can't be homophobic and racist for the millenial/zoomer crowd any more. And it can't be too pro-corporate either because millenials and zoomers are feeling to shafted by late-stage capitalism. But at the same time it can't be progressive or pro socialist either.

	Sagaar must walk a very tight rope. I don't envy him.

			I work with a stage blue christian organization in the south side of chicago... I think some level of blue indoctrination actually can be beneficial in helping bring order red communities move up in consciousness. From an absolute perspective, fundamentalist christians are of course the devil... that said, fundamental religion and order is the logical answer to stage red impulsiveness and egocentricity.

<p>
	Yes, but it also matters how it is done. There are healthy and unhealthy ways to go Blue.

<p>
	That's actually a very popular tactic of fundamentalist Christians. They specifically prey on troubled and wounded people at around stage Red because they are ripe for Christian indoctrination.

<p>
	The devil preys on the weak by offering them cookies. The devil never presents himself as some evil monster. He lures you in with nuggets of truth and wisdom which he then twists to twist your mind. The devil's whole MO is to make truth and falsehood so conflated as to be indistinguishable. The devil never peddles pure falsehood as that would be artless and far less effective than lacing truth with poison.

<p>
	When you run as a pro-American exceptionalism candidate, many Americans will see that the moderate position.
</p>

<p>
	To a religious personal, Hilary can easily appear more radical than Trump.
</p>

<p>
	And Hilary was uniquely demonized in right-wing circles for 15 years. It was a cottage industry to demonize her.
</p>

<p>
	Most voters do not follow the news or policy at all. They get their political opinions from their social circle, which turns into an echo-chamber of ideological ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate how little ordinary folks follow the news in any informative sense. They lack all basic facts. A third of the country probably could not name who the VP is.
</p>

<p>
	Guys, just to remind you, keep in mind that our objective here is not to get stuck in political content but to do Conscious Politics, which means going meta and observing how your own mind plays out its biases with political content and how it gets attached to its own positions and all the defense mechanisms it uses to justify them.
</p>

<p>
	The real game here is to not get stuck at the level of content and opinions, but to realize that it's all games your mind is playing in order to feel superior.
</p>

<p>
	In the big picture, it doesn't matter who kills whom. What matters is how your mind thinks about such things and how aware it is of its own biases and attachments.
</p>

<p>
	When you start taking sides and getting defensive, that's when you've lost the game.
</p>

<p>
	There's really no right or wrong in such cases, it's all a matter of difference in perspectives and being able to hold multiple perspectives at once.
</p>

<p>
	It can still be valuable to build a business and be successful as part of your larger life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	Business is a great way to escape wage slavery and help the world at the same time. You just have to go about it in a conscious way.
</p>

<p>
	Basically 90%+ of all ways of making a living = some kind of business. So you can't really escape business. It's more a question of what kind of business you do.

			But, is aesthetic ego based then? What about a master piece work of art?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Beauty is an absolute, but the ego's job is to filter Infinity down to a limited, manageable, survivable level. Ego does this through biasing reality to suit its own needs and wants.
</p>

<p>
	When the ego finds the master piece work of art beautiful, it is seeing through the clouds of its own selfishness to the absolute Beauty which permeates all of Creation. But the ego is so biased and limited in its vision that it falsely attributes this beauty to that one work of art. It doesn't realize that the wall on which the art hangs is just as beautiful and wondrous as the work of art itself.
</p>

<p>
	Ego always sees partial truths, partial beauties, partial goodnesses. So it's not that the ego is wrong, per se, it's just always limited and partial.
</p>

<p>
	It's like if I showed you a master piece work of art but your mind only focused on the face and missed the other 95% of the painting. You'd say, "That's a beautiful face! OMG!" Which is true. But you're still missing the other 95% of the beauty because your mind isn't open enough.
</p>

<p>
	In this way the ego is never technically wrong. It's just highly partial and missing a lot of stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Beauty is an Absolute. Free of the ego's biases, all of God's creation is seen to be Perfectly Beautiful.
</p>

<p>
	Any serious Buddhist knows this.

<p>
	I see a trigger-happy jackass teen playing macho vigilante near a serious protest, and naturally hell breaks loose.
</p>

<p>
	This is why in a sane society one should not be allowed to open-carry assault rifles near large crowds of people.
</p>

<p>
	The entire notion of these militia groups is absurd. State must have a monopoly on carrying firearms in the city streets and law enforcement.
</p>

<p>
	Citizens cannot be allowed to do law enforcement. Especially angsty 17 year olds with a political agenda. Law enforcement is hard enough as it is for trained professionals.
</p>

Next time go slower with your doses. And try plugging rather than vaping it. You will be much more comfortable in it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there are many levels and even kinds of of ego-death. Even what you got there is still only the beginning, really.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-death on salvia is even more intense and freaky than that of 5-MeO-DMT as you will lose all memory of having been human. You won't even know that you are inside your house or who your wife is, as your memory gets nulled out.
</p>

<p>
	And ego-death itself isn't the end either. Beyond ego-death there are many degrees of God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	Except it obviously isn't since your baseline cannot match a peak.
</p>

<p>
	You can deny the existence of peaks all you want, but that doesn't mean they ain't there. You are just sticking your head in the sand, creating the illusion that your baseline is high consciousness.

<p>
	There cannot be such a simple answer to this question.
</p>

<p>
	It all depends. It varies from person to person and it even varies for the same person depending on his point on the path. And they are not mutually exclusive but all synergize together.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to talk about which method will raise consciousness the most within 30 minutes, no doubt psychedelics beat everything else.

</p>

<p>
	It's not about cars or money or appealing to hippie chicks with hippy crack. It's about learning to become a strong, authentic man with powerful social skills who exudes charm, humor, charisma, and presence. It's about becoming grounded and confident.
</p>

<p>
	These qualities are attractive regardless of culture or Spiral stage. You can attract a crack whore this way or a yogi saint.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is distinction from relationship compatibility. You could attract a crack whore but not be compatible with her value set. Likewise a yogi saint.
</p>

<p>
	You need to screen girls for compatibility. Doing so will make you even more attractive.
</p>

<p>
	The issue there is that there is no clear line between protests and riots. One can easily transform into the other. So it's easy to paint anyone supporting the peaceful protestors as enabling riots.

<p>
	I consider those peaceful forms of protest, but again, they can easily devolve into bullying and other forms of mob mentality which is problematic.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of a large mob of disgruntled people is that it becomes impossible to control or predict.

</p>

<p>
	5-MeO absolutely does NOT work well one everyone. I've seen people simply not respond to 5-MeO or DMT. Like they are immune to it. To them it is a mild or not profound experience.
</p>

<p>
	For me, a small hit of DMT is so profound that it's impossible to put into words. No amount of meditation or yoga will ever produce such levels of consciousness and understanding. It is beyond anything humanly possible or even imaginable by the mind and it goes beyond all nondual teachings into realms of science fiction.

	Jimmy Dore has that view for sure. Which is why I don't like his show.
</p>

<p>
	It's so clever it's dumb. Even Zizek has admitted that Trump winning in 2020 is not going be a net win for the radical socialists. Zizek bought the idea that Trump was necessary in 2016 in order to send a message to the establishment. But he sees now that Trump is too dangerous to risk sending such "messages". It's like playing a game of chicken.

<p>
	I think Kyle will vote for Biden after all his huffing and puffing and posturing. Krystal probably not.

<p>
	I look upon that more kindly.
</p>

<p>
	I think they are being foolish and utopian, but I get it. People like that tend to be less pragmatic or savvy about how power works.
</p>

<p>
	But to actively vote for Trump in 2020 is today's analog of re-electing Hitler. Public people who do that should have their names recorded in the history books' hall of shame.
</p>

<p>
	I can forgive a guy for voting for Trump back in 2016 as they were unaware of what Trump was capable of. But now in 2020??? Now it's just getting farcical.

<p>
	Rising's problem is that they have created a brand/identity out of being contrarian, so now almost by definition they have to do the opposite of the mainstream media, even if the mainstream media says something valid.

			Would it be wrong to think of the emergence of green as the embrace of femininity and softening of masculinity in that sense?

<p>
	Green has a more integrated and expansive self-identity. Which of course embraces the feminine aspects which were suppressed at Red, Blue, and Orange -- especially by males.
</p>

<p>
	It think in today's age men get stuck at Orange more easily while women naturally gravitate out of Orange towards Green because it aligns nicely with their feminine strength. For this reason many men resist Green because they perceive it as threatening the masculine identity they've struggled to cultivate for a decade or more. Hence the whole "soy-boy" meme and guys making fun of each other as "fags" or "that's gay".

<p>
	I wouldn't go that far. I don't think Kyle wants a Trump victory. At least I give him that benefit of the doubt.
</p>

<p>
	Now Sagaar seems like he will be voting for Trump, which to me nullifies anything coming out of his mouth. Anyone who preaches populism but then votes for Trump is a fool not to be taken seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is the perfect litmus test. If someone is voting for Trump in 2020, that's how you know exactly the kind of person they are. Which how we suss out folks like Tim Pool. We know exactly the kind of guy he is.

	Stage Orange critiques of post-modernism are also a virus.

<p>
	They are limited in that regard.
</p>

<p>
	But the peak experiences are very significant for growth.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be fair here though. Listening to Shunyamurti or attending one of his retreats is certainly not going to raise your baseline level of consciousness either.
</p>

<p>
	You can learn more from DMT than you can from listening to all the gurus on YT. So it's absurd when a YT guru claims that psychedelics are somehow illusory or a distraction because psychedelics are certainly more powerful than any words coming out of a guru's mouth.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a bag of DMT you can ditch all the gurus.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't rocket science. Combat sports are designed to cater to chimps and the people who get most attracted to it are chimp-like in their cognitive and moral development.

			Lastly, I think sam seders majority report and TYT is much more mature and evolved progressive channel than rising and secular talk. Rising and secular talk are hurting more than benefiting progressives.

<p>
	That is the the problem with idealists and ideological puritans. They get so smug off their own moral righteousness that they lose sense of the pragmatic aspects of politics.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that most Americans are simply not as progressive as Krystal and Kyle think they are. It would be nice if Krystal and Kyle woke up to that reality. Then they would stop smearing the more centrist Dems.
</p>

<p>
	Most voters are centrist. Which means in a democracy that centrists will win lots of elections and hold lots of power. So constantly rail against this reality is rather silly. They might as well be railing against water being wet.
