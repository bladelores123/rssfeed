Nothing IS Absolute Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is a self-negating self-negation.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is a happening which never actually happened.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	God is that.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to figure this out using the mind. It will not work. It is profoundly paradoxically. The mind cannot handle it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics and/or yoga is the way to go about realizing this.
</p>

That's exactly correct. All experiences are in fact eternal. They have existed FOREVER. This very sentence you are reading has existed within Absolute Infinity for eternity. The mind is just overlooking this oh-so-obvious fact.
</p>

<p>
	Right now, look around the room you're in. You are looking at eternity in the flesh.

Say if you became hella enlightened right now(like for example Eckhart Tolle) how important would it be to do personal development? I feel like you would grow hugely from the enlightenment. And then the need for books wouldn’t really be a thing? Is studying personal development literature important?(say standard self help like tony Robbins, or maybe some sort of stage green or yellow self help?) or would you not need that since you are beyond all that? You have outgrown it all after you integrated the enlightenment? Maybe you have gone up to turqoise within a couple years? What is the importance of literature on personal development when you have a radical enlightenment? I’m just trying to get a big picture here.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It would still be important. Of course having a massive enlightenment will itself produce a huge shift in your development. But that will not be enough by itself. There will still be many things which you are unconscious of and many ways to improve your life. Your bad habits and shadow side will still largely remain unaddressed. You will still lack important skills and knowledge for succeeding in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment will not automatically put you at Turquoise. Turquoise requires additional work. Being a good human being also requires additional work. Fully embodying your enlightenment requires additional work. Becoming a good teacher requires additional work. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	And having one complete massive life-shattering enlightened is extremely rare. Chances are high you will fall back asleep after your first glimpse, or have some kind of ego-backlash.

You have an intellectual understanding (which is a good start) but now you need to actually awaken.

<p>
	Kriya yoga & psychedelics will get you there much faster.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, consciousness is basically the same as hyper-lucidity. You become so lucid you realize there is no difference between difference and sameness. You become conscious that the metaphysical distinctions underlying your entire sense of reality are all meaningless: self vs world, life vs death, real vs unreal, something vs nothing. All of these distinctions collapse and you are left in pure nonduality. Reality becomes indistinct. Your identity collapses to zero and expands to infinity simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
	At this level of lucidity, life as you know it is over. You have awoken from "life". You realize that your entire "life" was just a dream. You have died and awoken to realize that death is impossible because you are God. You are suspended in an infinite eternal state of Nirvana. You have achieved actual immortality. You realize that your true identity is an infinity singularity, which includes inside it every living creature that has ever existed or will exist. You are so lucid that you have 100% omniscient understanding of all of reality. You realize that you have created yourself using infinite intelligence and that nothing exists but yourself.
</p>

<p>
	This degree of consciousness cannot be imagined or believed. It is extremely radical. It defies all scientific or rational explanation.
</p>

<p>
	Real vs unreal is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality = all distinctions collapse into a unity. At this ultimate, Absolute level of consciousness, there is literally no difference between anything. There is not even a difference between real and unreal.
</p>

<p>
	Practically, you should make a distinction in your mind between level of consciousness vs level of development.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment work is about raising your level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Personal development is about raising your level of development and changing your life around.
</p>

<p>
	Both are very important.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity has no opposite. It is total. It already includes an infinite number of other realities.
</p>

<p>
	There is no "more" than Absolute Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Like so:

	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Anything you can think of (and everything you can't) is already accounted for by Absolute Infinity.

<p>
	If this was strictly true, no human being could ever have become enlightened ever.
</p>

<p>
	But your point is valid practically-speaking for the vast majority of seekers.
</p>

<p>
	Hardcore seekers can accomplish enlightenment without any tutelage or theory. But if you are on this forum or watching my videos, that ain't you.

<p>
	That video is a nice attempt, but that approach will always fail.
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to have a scientific theory of everything because a theory is precisely not everything, and neither is science.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not a code or a language or an equation or a model of any kind.
</p>

<p>
	The only proper theory of everything is: Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	But that's not a theory. That's actual everything (and nothing) <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Any attempt to capture the Truth in symbols will always fail. The Truth cannot fit into any kind of box because the box itself is an infinitely small part of the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	What science is trying to do can only be achieved through spirituality. And it was already achieved 5000 years ago. The problem is, people still don't get it.

Some people are more heart-centered, some people are more intellectual. I am pretty intellectual so I love asking questions and exploring how the mind works. I can see that some people will not like that approach to spirituality.

</p>

<p>
	What I find works best for me is to do lots of questioning in my everyday life, long before the trip starts. Then when I trip I don't really demand any answers or even set much of an intention, the answers will just naturally flow to me because I have been so curiously asking questions for the last month or two.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you are genuinely curious about, you will likely get answered.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not curious about anything, you will likely get no profound answers. Because hey, you don't give a shit, so why should the universe cast its pearls before such a swine? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	In my experience the universe rewards pearl-connoisseurs.

<p>
	A person who wants nothing from life will get his wish met.

<p>
	In the ultimate end, yes. But that's a long ways to go for most people. It is important not to be in too big of a rush to reach that ultimate place because there are lessons which will be missed along the way.
</p>

<p>
	As an analogy, the ultimate end of going to school is that you will exit school. But it would be a big mistake to exist school in 3rd grade or to tell people "Stop going to school because the end-goal is no-school". You gotta exit it by passing through all the grades. Then you will be truly free.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually you will transcend all questions and answers, and just be. But to get there, you will have to start asking some deep questions and seeking some deep answers.
</p>

Which greatly overestimates the abilities of ordinary folk.
</p>

<p>
	From an enlightened-master's POV, his consciousness does not seem super-human to him. But from the ordinary folks POV, it is.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics make this very clear because they expand consciousness so dramatically in such a short period of time, and then drop you back down just as fast. Which creates a great sense of the degrees that consciousness comes in.
</p>

<p>
	By doing years of slow, gradual meditation work, people can easily forget just how unconscious they used to be and just how much they've grown.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I often catch myself taking my last 5 years of growth for granted. Sorta just assuming that all people are like me, and that even I was like me 5 years ago. But this is an illusion. I've grown enormously. It's just become my new normal to the point where its hard to even remember how unconscious I used to be.
</p>

<p>
	The average person is nowhere close to being able to see infinity. I still struggle seeing it sober even though intellectually I know I'm smack dab inside it all the time.
</p>

<title>Knowing Metaphysical Truths is Irrelevant/Tangential to the Path to Enlightenment.</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/24031-knowing-metaphysical-truths-is-irrelevanttangential-to-the-path-to-enlightenment/?do=findComment&amp;comment=267114</link>

<p>
	Not quite. To become conscious of:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What am I?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is another?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is love?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is existence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is consciousness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is language?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is a distinction?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is intelligence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is ego?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is suffering?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is happiness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is a thought?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is emotion?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This is the essence of enlightenment work. And all of those are metaphysical questions. And they certainly CAN be answered (not necessarily verbally or intellectually).
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem for most people is that they don't take such questions seriously. They are not genuinely curious about them. They do not seriously wonder. Which is why I shoot videos like What Is Consciousness, Understanding Absolute Infinity, What Is Intelligence, etc. Those videos are my attempts to get people to start wondering about these questions.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is purely a metaphysical pursuit. Just not in an intellectual or belief-based way. True metaphysical understanding comes through expanded consciousness, mindfulness, holistic thinking, and hyper-intuition.
</p>

<p>
	That Buddha quote is being misapplied here. When we talk about metaphysics, we are not talking about petty questions like whether the bow string is made of of fiber or bamboo thread. Just the opposite. To wonder about any of the questions I listed above is to leave aside all the petty human questions related to survival and to follow the path of the Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha was a metaphysician of the highest order.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, it's very important that you avoid idle speculation on the above questions or grand theory-building. Your contemplation must be grounded in direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	It does no good to sit around speculating about what God is. You must seek God directly in your experience.
</p>

<p>
	And all of these questions become super-important inside psychedelic trips. They are like keys that unlock the various doors of divine wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	The answers to the above questions are the MOST relevant to your liberation and happiness.
</p>

<title>Developing the &quot;REAL&quot; doing nothing technique</title>

So you just sit there and every time you notice an attempt to manipulate your experience arise, you let it go. And you keep doing this over and over again until you are completely surrendered to just the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	Surrender all techniques, surrender all desire to manipulate thoughts or change your experience in any way.
</p>

<p>
	It's a wonderful method. But sometimes it also produces lots of monkey mind because you're letting go of all control. This is normal. The monkey mind will eventually subside.
</p>

<p>
	But Kriya yoga is still far superior.
</p>

<p>
	Do nothing becomes amazing after a few months/years of Kriya yoga.
</p>

<p>
	On that point he is wrong.
</p>

<p>
	He hasn't become fully conscious of infinity because his physics background is in the way.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is actual Infinity. In fact, that's the only thing that exists: infinity. Every other object is just a consequence of infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is infinite both as a whole and as every part of the whole. Infinity contains within it an infinite number of infinities.
</p>

<p>
	This requires a radical, super-human level of consciousness to realize so it's not surprising that very few people realize it. Even those people who are into spirituality, meditation, and nonduality rarely reach Infinity.

	The point is to see the marvelous beauty of every moment.
</p>

<p>
	Being is its own point.

<p>
	There is nowhere to get to it but here and now.

<p>

<p>
	Next time you trip, put away all distractions. No taking notes, no computers, no smart phones, no reading.
</p>

<p>
	Recording and documenting your trip interferes with you fully diving into it.
</p>

<p>
	And don't think so much. All that thinking is getting in the way. Just go on the ride. Drop the expectations like, "Leo told me this will be profound, but it isn't. What is wrong?" That's all a distraction.

<p>
	What you believe is false.
</p>

<p>
	If Truth would only be present in deep sleep, it would not be Truth, it would be contingent. The whole point of Truth is that it's ALWAYS the case.
</p>

<p>
	Stop arguing and open your mind to the guidance being given you. This is not a point of debate or uncertainty. You are simply mistaken.

<p>
	God is Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	But what you're missing is that Nothingness is identical to Somethingness.
</p>

<p>
	Thus, everything you see before your eyes right now is God. Somethingness = Nothingness. God = Everything.
</p>

<p>
	This is the essence of nonduality. All distinctions collapse such that everything becomes Nothingness. Nothingness is NOT a blank void. Nothingness is precisely everything you see around you.
</p>

<p>
	You are holding Nothing as distinct from Something. Which is a duality. When that duality finally collapses, you will realize, "Oh shit! Everything was Nothing the whole time! There is no difference between existence and non-existence, life and death, reality and fantasy."

	Channeling is a very common phenomenon. You can learn to do it yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Hundreds of how-to books have been written about it.
</p>

<p>
	But you must have a radically open mind.
</p>

<p>
	If you think people who a different than you are deluded, then you're really stuck.

If you need to, take some quick inhales in between your outbreath, so you can make it all way down to the 1st chakra.

</p>

<p>
	Virtual reality is just another way of saying idealism.

<title>Consciousness is within everything, even the body after it dies?</title>

You can dye the water with various colors, but if the water is stirred around too much the colors will just dissolve and all that remains is clear water. This water cannot ever "die" or go anywhere because everything is always 100% water. There is no alternative to water in this universe. Your body is made out of various colored dyes in this water, and eventually it will dissolve. But the water (which is what you really are), will always remain because it has nowhere else to go.
</p>

<p>
	The water is not in the colored dyes. The dyes are in the water. The dyes are themselves made out of water. There is only one thing in existence: water. It just takes on different forms. You can make a chair out of water, a table, a cat, a dog, your mother, your father, your boss, your car, your body, etc.

<title>Experiencing &quot;God&quot;, possible?</title>

<p>
	God-mode is not other than whatever is happening in your experience right now.
</p>

<p>
	Your very experience is God-mode. It just requires a radical recontextualization to see it.
</p>

<p>
	Currently you are contextualizing your experience as "humans perception of a physical reality". This is false. All that's required to enter God-mode is to destroy that false conceptually-based context.
</p>

<p>
	You are already in God-mode. The problem is you don't realize it yet. You're misinterpreting what's right before your eyes, confusing God with "physical reality".
</p>

</p>

<p>
	These people are so high-functioning it is beyond your ability to fathom.
</p>

<p>
	They are also extremely modest and humble. Which makes it difficult for a stage Orange person like yourself to appreciate their depth of mastery because you have confused Tai Lopez -style flashy gimmickry for proof of high functionality.
</p>

<p>
	That Sadhguru looks like a homeless person makes his mastery all the more remarkable.
</p>

<p>
	You expect an immortal human being to have gold chains around his neck and a diamond watch?
</p>

<p>
	Get real.

</p>

<p>
	There is no method to enlightenment. Enlightenment is always the case and there is no way to get to it other than to realize it right now. Stop looking for a "how". There is no how. How is already too indirect.
</p>

<p>
	It's difficult precisely because it is RADICALLY DIRECT. You are already it, yet you are trying to "get to it", which is already 1 step too far.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is step 0. The mind does not know how to take step 0 because any movement of the mind is already step 1, and so one step too far.
</p>

<p>
	You keep looking and looking but looking will not work. What's required is being. Being is prior to looking.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic so you can be shown what being is, so you know what to pursue.
</p>

The number of permanent residencies given out each year is very tiny. You're about as likely to win the lottery.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to move here is to start a successful business in your home country, then expand it into the US and hire 20 employees here. Then they will give you residency and citizenship.
</p>

<p>
	That's how my dad did it.
</p>

<p>
	As always, if you want something in life, rather than asking others to give you value, you become the provider of value. Don't ask the USA to provide you with free value. Provide the USA with value first, and then the doors will open to you.
</p>

<p>
	This is a general strategy for anything you want it life. Provide massive value to others first without asking anything in return.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want something, you gotta be willing to work for it and be super creative.

			I remember a while ago you had made a few videos about the idea that the enlightened person should be able to sit in a room by themselves for the rest of their life and be happy. Do you still believe this to be the case? Is it something that is attainable?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	An enlightened person can do that. Because with enlightenment you will realize that there is no one in this universe but yourself. You are all alone. And this isn't a problem. It's perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, don't use this as some excuse to not learn how to interact with people.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful about taking on enlightenment insights without first having experienced enlightenment. You cannot fake your way to enlightenment. It's better to admit wherever you currently are rather than trying to act in ways which you haven't developed to yet.
</p>

<p>
	Nor should enlightenment be pursued for silly purposes like: "I want to be happy on an island all by myself." If that happens, it will happen naturally AFTER awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to try to achieve post-awakening results pre-awakening. Post-awakening results only come post-awakening.

<p>
	You guys bullshit on here way too much. Stop speculating about things you clearly do not understand.
</p>

<p>
	Be here with an open mind and ready to learn, not to spout your pet theories about consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You are being told how it is. Don't complicate it. Just open your mind to the teaching. This is not a topic to debate or even discuss.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is consciousness. Period. End of story. Stop wasting time arguing about it.
</p>

<p>
	It's your job to have a direct experience of this truth.

<p>

<p>
	With all these kinds of techniques, it's not about strictly adhering to the rules, it's about finding what is workable for you, your mind, your personality, your body. Stick to the spirit of the technique but otherwise feel free to experiment a bit. That way you will customize it to suit your individual needs.

<p>
	For long sits I have several different cushions on hand and a Zen-style Seiza meditation bench, and swap between them in between various Kriya exercises.
</p>

<p>
	I find it too uncomfortable to sit for 1 hour cross-legged. It tends to cut off circulation in one of my legs, which distracts me from my yoga. The Seiza bench also creates much better spine alignment. But it still starts to get uncomfortable after about 1 hour. Still, far more comfortable than sitting cross-legged.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to find a sitting position which you can be in for 1 hour+. Because your sets will get that long. So try various ways until you find something which you're comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
	I am still experimenting with the best sitting postures for a 1h 20 min set. It's quite challenging to sit that long and then still be able to concentration in the last 10 minutes (where concentration is most important).

</p>

<p>
	But then again, I'm using standard terms here.
</p>

<p>
	If "awake" is unclear to you, that's because you've never experienced awakening (enlightenment). It's very clear once you do.
</p>

<p>
	Mind is bit trickier to define, but in this context it means: all the thinking you're doing to try to make sense of reality. The entire domain of concepts.
</p>

<p>
	Paradox is pretty easy to define: a contradiction due to a self-reference. For example: "Everything I say is a lie."
</p>

<p>
	From a high-level perspective, they are all basically the same.
</p>

<p>
	But people love to split hairs about it.

<p>
	Life is indulgence. The key question is: Is your indulgence turning into dysfunction?
</p>

<p>
	If you call yourself an "incel" then the most important thing you need to do is to get out of the house and start socializing. Stop living in your virtual world of video games, Youtube, social media, Reddit, and online forums. Go connect with real people in the real world.

<title>The labels &quot;Introvert&quot;/&quot;Extrovert&quot; are ABSURD and DISRUPTIVE!</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/23870-the-labels-introvertextrovert-are-absurd-and-disruptive/?do=findComment&amp;comment=265623</link>

<p>
	You gotta keep in mind that introversion/extroversion is a spectrum. Many people are somewhere in the middle.
</p>

<p>
	For me, I am very introverted and have been my whole life. Yet most people who meet me face to face would think I am an extrovert because one-on-one I can get very animated and go into a deep conversation with some close friend. But I am terrible at small talk or meeting new people because the shallowness of it bores me and drains my energy.
</p>

<p>
	For me, the introversion label fits perfectly. And I know others whom it fits perfectly too. And I also know extroverts who are just the opposite: they go into a bar and light up like a Christmas tree. As an introvert I just can't do that. Small talk wears me out. I need quiet intimate environments, not noisy clubs or bars.
</p>

<p>
	All that said, I can still push myself to go to a bar and be extroverted. It just feels very unnatural.
</p>

<p>
	So a lot this has to do with what feels most natural to you.
</p>

<p>
	Would you rather have 100 friends who you rarely have a deep conversation with, or 3 really close friends? Extroverts tend to have 100s of friends, so many they don't even have time to meet them for more than 10 minutes. An introvert will have a couple good friends but spend hours talking to them.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, as with all theories, categories, and models, don't let it limit you. Use it to deepen your understanding, and if it doesn't help you do that, throw it away. For me it's a handy distinction which explains how I tend to act.
</p>

Or did you just pop a pill at a rave?
</p>

<p>
	Doing it at a rave will of course produce few profound insights.
</p>

<p>
	It also sounds like you have a high tolerance, therefore requring appropriately higher dosage.

<p>
	Paradox is what happens when the finite mind tries to model the infinite universe.
</p>

<p>
	When you are awake, there is no paradox. It just is and it makes perfect sense. But not to the mind.

<title>How is consciousness not brain activity?</title>

<p>
	"The brain" is made out of consciousness. End of story. It's as simple as that.
</p>

<p>
	Where else have you seen a brain but inside your consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	Really look! It is impossible for anything to exist outside your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Try to name one thing which contradicts what I said. And notice you are wrong each time.
</p>

<p>
	This is a very classic spiritual trap.
</p>

<p>
	Sexual repression does not work and will actually retard your development.
</p>

<p>
	True celebacy comes AFTER decades of deep spiritual work. It must come naturally, not be forced.
</p>

<p>
	People think they can ape enlightened masters and become enlightened that way -- by copying their external behaviors -- but that doesn't work. What's required is an inner transformation, which only comes from deep practice.
</p>

<p>
	This is the whole problem of the Catholic Church in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't compare yourself at 20 years old to a 60 year old yogi. The hormone levels are totally different. In their 20's many of these yogis were likely fornicating like rabbits. See Gandhi as one example.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When you get in the ring, sometimes you'll get your ass kicked. But it's okay. You will recover and be ready for more rounds.
</p>

<p>
	And always remember that every trip is different. Don't let any one trip color all your future trips.

	Lol, then what are you complaining about? You got exactly what you wanted.
</p>

<p>
	What you learned is: don't be cocky with psychedelics. If you treat them like toys, they will slap you around.
</p>

<p>
	It was an important lesson. From now on you will respect psychedelics and your trips should go better.
</p>

<p>
	Proper dosage is also very important. Don't over do it.

</p>

<p>
	Introvert: someone who get energized being alone, drains energy being with people. Introverts make fewer but deeper friendships. Doesn't like to approach new people, prefers new people to approach them.
</p>

<p>
	Extrovert: someone who gets energized being with people. Extroverts makes lots of shallow friendships. Loves to approach new people and make new friends.

</p>

<p>
	The problem with people who glibly denounce relativism is that they themselves are often the most deluded ones, thinking they've figured it all out.
</p>

<p>
	Relativism is a stage above rationalism, but there are also stages above it.

For language to work at all it requires making relative distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	You're way overcomplicating this.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute cannot be spoken or even thought.
</p>

<p>
	Wittgenstein did not fathom nonduality and his philosophy is not worth much even though he has a few great lines to quote.
</p>

<p>
	Derrida's analysis of language is much more on-point.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a very important distinction. If you fail to make this distinction you will get yourself into all sorts of trouble.
</p>

<p>
	Most everyday language is coming from and speaking about the relative domain. This needs to be clearly understood. So if your spouse says to you: "Hey, did you take the trash out?" you do not reply with, "I don't exist and trash is just an illusion."
</p>

<p>
	When a question is asked from the relative domain, the answer must meet the question where it is at.
</p>

<p>
	And as for the Absolute domain, it's really hard to speak about anyway. So anything you say about it will ultimately devolve into contradictions and paradoxes because language is dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	We do our best speaking about these things, always remembering that we will always fall short of the Truth with our explanations.
</p>

<p>
	Do other people really exist? Nope. But we must still live life as if they do for practical reasons.
</p>

<p>
	Is money real? Nope. But we still need to earn it to feed ourselves.
</p>

<p>
	Is food real? Nope. But we still need to eat it in order to keep the illusion of our bodies going.
</p>

<p>
	Is time real? Nope. But we still need to set our clocks to the same time so we can coordinate.
</p>

<p>
	In a world of only illusion, illusion becomes the reality.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When you first start, your practices will feel rusty. That's okay. Just keep doing the best you can. Don't let perfectionism interfere with your practice. Give yourself time and leeway. Trust that things will sort themselves out after a few weeks of practice.

This work is so challenging. I envy your strength.  I don't know how I can muster the strength and courage to go so deep again. Being tortured, defeated, failing God, and dragged toward Hell has no words that can be written to explain it. Not knowing who you are and having absolutely no grounding and struggling to feel supported and loved by God makes it even harder. I suppose the fact that "I'm back" shows that I am still loved.

<p>
	The ego likes to make a big epic struggle out of awakening. Stay mindful of how you're playing up the drama. It isn't necessary. You can trip calmly in a very pleasant yet profound way.
</p>

<p>
	Every trip is unique.
</p>

<p>
	One trip doesn't really say much.
</p>

<p>
	Do 30 trips and then you'll have a decent sense of the terrain and where you stand.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. It sounds like your dose was way too high. Stay at 125ug of LSD (1 tab) for now. Blasting your mind with psychedelic overdoses is counter-productive. You want to find a comfortable dose where you are able to contemplate and still remember.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to make your first psychedelic experiences pleasant, not sickening. Otherwise you'll never want to do it again.
</p>

<p>
	LSD is the better way.
</p>

<p>
	I don't take any psychedelics which would make me feel nauseous or sick. It gets in the way of the contemplating and it's totally unnecessary. The natives take it simply because they have no better options.
</p>

<p>
	Puking your guts out is just unnecessary with today's technology.

</p>

<p>
	"Gravity" is NOT an empirical observation. It's a conceptual scheme which you're using to explain many, many various kinds of empirical observations.
</p>

<p>
	Before Newton invented gravity, it did not exist. But objects did still fall downward on this planet. But "gravity" is way more than the observation of objects falling down on this planet. Which is precisely why it took a genius like Newton to invent gravity. People had been observing falling objects for thousands of years but had no notion of gravity.
</p>

<p>
	A cat clearly sees objects falling down. But a cat does not know gravity. Gravity does not exist to a cat. Although the cat is still affected by "it".

	You are mixing up relative and absolute levels.

<p>
	When I say something like, "You're missing out on psychedelics" I am speaking in common parlance. The plain fact is that people who have never done psychedelics have no idea what they're missing.
</p>

<p>
	Don't muddy the waters here with petty pedantry.
</p>

<p>
	For someone who's stuck thinking enlightenment is a waste of time, the proper guidance is: go do a psychedelic.

<p>
	Problem solved. Now they will be ready to start doing spiritual practices.

<p>
	Sounds like you got some inner demons to work out.
</p>

<p>
	The point of tripping is not to trip once, but to trip and contemplate consistently. Whatever fears you've got need working through.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than playing around with a friend, next time, sit quietly and contemplate reality.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take the devil thing too seriously. The devil is not other than God.

<p>
	Precisely because it's too direct.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with enlightenment is not that one can't do it, it's that one doesn't WANT to do it.
</p>

<p>
	To want enlightenment is to already be 50% of the way there.

There are no fixed anchor points, except for the Groundless Ground itself.

</p>

<p>
	This is no way to live. This is like being a zombie or a slave. So of course that will lead to depression. It's a guaranteed recipe for misery.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine instead living as though you are inside a dream or a work of art. Full of wonder and passion at every turn.

<p>
	That guy don't know jack about creativity.
</p>

<p>
	The whole key to creativity is that it produces entirely new things. Yes, it builds on itself, but true creativity is always new.
</p>

<p>
	Creativity created the entire fucking universe from scratch! Creativity is infinitely intelligent.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. And he's wrong about love too.

<p>
	Happiness is being conscious of the magnificence of existence in every moment, your mind uncluttered with conceptual baggage and petty "human stuff".
</p>

<p>
	As a child, that was you natural state. Then as you aged, your mind was brainwashed and corrupted with the petty human concerns of your society and culture.
</p>

<p>
	To see the magic in every moment of existence independent of external conditions is what you really want. It's the only thing that will truly satisfy you. Which is where spiritual practices come into play. Spiritual practices help you to develop a metaphysical connection to reality, rather than the utilitarian, transactional mode from which you currently operate.
</p>

<p>
	As a kid, your mode of interaction with reality was non-transactional. Which gave you genuine joy.
</p>

<title>Mystical experiences vs radical recontextualizations</title>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10252-tsuki/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="10252" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10252-tsuki/" rel="">@tsuki</a> The trick is that the notion of "facts" is itself already theory-laden.
</p>

<p>
	To believe in "facts" is already to buy into the false idea that there is an external objective reality independent of the subject.
</p>

<p>
	What is a fact?
</p>

<p>
	That is a good thing to contemplate.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with facts is that they are always entangled with one's mode of perception or the questions one asks. This was the fundamental discovery of quantum mechanics: there are no actual facts. There are only responses to measurements. Change your measuring stick and the facts will also change.
</p>

<p>
	Facts are in a casual strange loop relationship with who you are and your perceptual system. Such that if we change your perceptual system, or your beliefs, we can change everything you consider a fact.
</p>

<p>
	The reason people disagree with and misunderstand each other so much is because they naively assume that everyone shares the same facts. This is false. A person at one level of development & consciousness will literally inhabit a different reality than a person at another level of development & consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is co-creating "the facts", but denies that it does so. This is a radical paradigm shift from the conventional materialist notion of reality.
</p>

<p>
	To put this very starkly, when you look at an object like a tree, there is in fact no tree there. You only see a tree because that's what your perceptual system pulls out of it. If you had a different perceptual system you would see something radically different in its place. The "actual" tree is in fact a cloud of infinite potential which crystallizes based on how your nervous system pings "it". You can get a taste for this by just walking around the tree and noticing that that tree "object" contains every possible angle from which you're viewing it. Such that what the tree really is, is all the infinite ways one can look at it (not just human, but all possible creatures).
</p>

<p>
	That is correct. The bias runs very deep. It is existential.
</p>

<p>
	But not so deep it cannot be undone.
</p>

<p>
	Our life's work is undoing this knot of self-bias.
