<p>
	The democrats HAVE found ground and they have made a ton of serious policy proposals. Trumps has no serious policy proposals other than anti-immigrant ones.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be making false equivalencies.
</p>

<p>
	The democrats have some of the best and most progressive candidates running in the history of the US. What more do you want? George Washington to crawl out of his grave and join the democratic debates? As soon as he learns about Trump he would crawl back into his grave and stay there.
</p>

<p>
	If people are stupid enough to vote for Trump a second time, nothing can save us. That ain't the democrats fault.

<p>
	How do you know? What if it is?
</p>

<p>
	What if your body is imaginary? How would you tell the difference if all you've ever experienced your whole life has been imagination?
</p>

<p>
	What if the very thing you think is real has always just been something you've been imagining to be real?
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine a thing to be real, does that mean it is real? Or is it still imaginary?
</p>

<p>
	How would you distinguish between you imagining something to be real vs it actually being real?

Right now it seems like the MSM is coalescing around Warren and she's picking up a lot of the failed centrist candidate's voters too, while Bernie is being deliberately ignored. I saw a while ago you betting someone that Bernie would win the election, and I feel silly for saying this but this is what I've been basing the last few months of my political analysis around. Now, I'm not so sure. What do you make the situation?

<p>
	It's certainly possible that Warren steals his votes.
</p>

<p>
	I see a big problem with Warren and Bernie splitting the progressive votes, giving Biden the nomination.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind that it's too early right now. Polls don't mean much yet.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie will win the election against Trump. But will he even get to face Trump? That's a big IF. Biden and Warren are both stronger than I hoped in the polls.

<p>
	The desire to manipulate reality to suit yourself is the very definition of ego.
</p>

<p>
	But also, you are able to bend many rules as you become more conscious. You just have to appreciate that your personal human desires are not what governs the universe. There is a deep intelligence to how everything is arranged, so think twice before imposing your human ideas on how the universe should be.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe one day you'll discover that everything is perfect exactly how it is and that nothing needs to be manipulated. Imagine that! What a concept!

<p>
	I wouldn't call that racist. Politics is tricky and many politicians aren't able to keep their promises for reasons other than racism.
</p>

<p>
	Wearing costumes when abroad is fairly typical for leaders.
</p>

<p>
	Racism is a pretty serious charge that requires solid evidence.

<p>
	I don't know of his "racist actions" besides the face paint. By all means share if you have some evidence.
</p>

<p>
	I'm much more open to hearing about actual systemic racist policy vs face paint. I prefer to criticize politicians on their terrible policies than personal gaffs.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is a bit of an exception because he is so clearly a morally bankrupt devil. But even Trump I have compassion for. He's doing the best he can.

			So, it's not just as simple as smudging some make-up on their face. TheseÂ mocking behaviors are actually very harmful and perpetuate all kinds of stereotypes.

<p>
	I agree that racism is still a problem.
</p>

<p>
	But I don't think it's right to ruin Trudeau's career for make up he wore to a party 15 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	I feel the voters of Canada can sort that out. It's been made public so now people can render their verdict at the ballot box.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget there are worse candidates in Canada than Trudeau who might win if he is tarred and feathered out of town. Canadian nationalism seems to be on the rise and a Trump-like Canadian president is not out of the realm of possibility, who would make Trudeau look like an angel.

<p>
	Dude, don't be so hard on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel lonely there's nothing wrong with finding some people to socialize with. In a sense that lonely feeling is telling you: "Hey dummy! You should socialize more!"
</p>

<p>
	What's inauthentic is desiring to socialize with someone but then not doing it out of fear that they will reject you. The authentic thing would be to walk over and say, "Hey, I was looking for a new friend and I saw you. So here I am. Please don't reject me or I will have to hang myself in my mother's basement with her vacuum cleaner cord."
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>BE MORE VULNERABLE WITH STRANGERS!</u></strong>

<p>
	There's not really much to discuss here. Try various techniques and discover what works best for you.
</p>

<p>
	And just keep an open mind that what works best for you will not necessarily work best for others. People's minds work in very different ways.

<p>
	That's technically true. But it's highly misleading.
</p>

<p>
	When I applied to CalTech by in my high school days I called them to ask what GPA I need to get in. They told me, "We have no GPA requirement." That's technically true. You can apply with a 3.5 GPA. But if your GPA is below 4.0, you ain't getting in. So be careful about kidding yourself.
</p>

<p>
	There are definitely things you can do to increase your odds of enlightenment. If this wasn't true, your teachers would be out of a job. Ralston holds enlightenment workshops. Obviously because he believes this increases your odds of enlightenment.

<p>

<p>
	Be careful about holding language as contradictory to Truth or awakening. Awakening can infuse itself into language. Some great spiritual texts have been written and channeled. And they ain't just stories and BS. There is serious truth and wisdom in them.

<p>
	For example, it is possible to communicate directly with God. Of course this will involve language.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well of course that can happen. As Ralston said, you can get enlightened while falling in a bathtub.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of random shit can happen. If you facilitate 1000 students some of them will accidentally get enlightened by picking their nose. But that's a red herring. That doesn't mean you should bank on "picking your nose" to enlighten you.
</p>

<p>
	Not all spiritual techniques are of equal efficacy. Some are really really ineffective. So my point is, find what is most effective for you.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are unique is that they are exceptionally effective. Same for meditation & yoga.
</p>

<p>
	Watching cartoons is not effective. Although even that could work once in a billion people.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston is also wrong. It is possible to invent a method for enlightenment (at least a temporary one). And 5-MeO-DMT is it.
</p>

<p>
	To call 5-MeO-DMT a mere change in state is very very misleading. Make sure you do it before you say such things. And it's not good enough to toy around with it. You gotta seriously do it. You gotta hit a breakthrough. I'm tried of people talking about 5-MeO who have not had a breakthrough. Trying a psychedelic don't mean shit. You gotta have that breakthrough. Lots of people have tried meditation but that doesn't mean anything. Trying it is not good enough. You must actualize its full potential. And that requires some serious effort, not a casual experiment.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind there are some people on whom 5-MeO-DMT seems to have no to little effect due to their genetics or whatever. So their dud experiments don't count.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston's teachings are very advanced and most of you will simply not be able to actualize what he is talking about. So watch out. There is good reason why spiritual techniques were invented. Most people need them.
</p>

			Iâve met and have friends now whom are deeply enlightened and have taken psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT for example AFTER their own enlightenment and itâs the same answer every time âitâs a cosmic <b><u>state</u></b> of ignorance. This isnât enlightenment.â That speaks WAY more than people taking substances and experiences crazy states whom arenât enlightened and never even had enlightenment experiences thinking that they now know what theyâre talking about. This isnât to say psychedelics are not helpful for human stuff like healing, emotional work, psychological work, getting past certain issues.Â 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You're not quite understanding how psychedelics work.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>There is nothing but states of consciousness.</u></strong> So you cannot escape states of consciousness since consciousness is the only thing that exists. There are just many different states and then there is understanding of how consciousness works.
</p>

<p>
	The point of a psychedelic is not to put you into a crazy state of consciousness per se. It's to reveal how consciousness works.
</p>

<p>
	The practical reality is that your state very much affects what you're able to become conscious of. If you're stuck in a bad state, you're basically fucked. You will not be capable of doing what Ralston says. In fact, basically no one is capable of doing the stuff Ralston says because their state is inadequate.
</p>

<p>
	The point of meditation and yoga is to permanently up your state so you have a reasonable chance of doing what Ralston takes for granted you can do.
</p>

<p>
	Although enlightenment is not directly limited to a state, one's state is really important for success in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck getting enlightened while you're in some PTSD state, depressed state, or opioid addicted state.
</p>

<p>
	States run your whole life. So dismiss states at your own peril.
</p>

<p>
	I feel bad saying "I told you so".

	These cults can be smelled from a thousand miles away to anyone who's seriously doing this work. Unfortunately virtually no one is seriously doing this work.

<p>
	It's very different because on the one hand you have a serious climate catastrophe which is being made worse through denial and indifference. On the other hand you have Trudeau wearing some brown face paint at a dress up party.
</p>

<p>
	Sending a mob after Trudeau is overkill. Giving a stark and impassioned speech to the UN about climate change is appropriate.

<title>Is fear a concept about the past too?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/40082-is-fear-a-concept-about-the-past-too/?do=findComment&amp;comment=502842</link>

<p>
	Fear is always about the future.
</p>

<p>
	You don't fear your past rape. You fear having to experience that again.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you are afraid of your memories of that event, what you fear is re-living that experience (via your memories) in the future.
</p>

<p>
	So even fear of a memory is fear of the future, not the past. Because fear is fundamentally resistance to future experience. If something has already been experienced, or is being currently experienced, it is not feared, since it's already here there is no need to fear it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't believe me. Explore how fear actually works in your direct experience. Notice whether your fear is actually of the past, the present, or the future. This requires some good mindfulness skill.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to turn this into speculation about how fear works. Do not speculate or guess! Actually look at what fear is doing in your direct experience. There's no room for guesswork here.
</p>

<p>
	Is fear about the past or the future? Don't guess! Check what your fear is doing.
</p>

<p>
	Shaming some folks in a UN speech is one thing, sicking a mob onto a political leader for a minor past mistake to get revenge is another thing.
</p>

<p>
	This requires a delicate balancing act. I don't think people should be fired for minor mistakes, like what happened with Al Franken. Sure, he made some mistakes, but did it really deserve a firing?
</p>

<p>
	We need some way of repremanding a person without destroying their whole career.

</p>

<p>
	Don't worry so much about getting a breakthrough. That will come naturally once you are ready for it. The way you get ready for it is by doing smaller trips, contemplating deeply, doing other practices, and taking time to integrate each trip.
</p>

<p>
	Do 10-20 smaller trips and integrate all those insights. Then you'll be ready for a breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	You're trying to go too fast and your psyche isn't equipped to handle it.
</p>

<p>
	This work is a marathon, not a sprint.
</p>

<p>
	It took me about 1 year to integrate my highest dose (30mg) 5-MeO-DMT trip. Now I can handle a lot more (not dosage-wise but insight-wise).
</p>

<p>
	It all comes down to this key question: How much mindfuck can your psyche handle?
</p>

<p>
	The mindfuck goes much deeper than anyone expects. It blindsides you and you don't even know what happened because Truth is such a mindfuck.
</p>

	Love is more powerful than mob revenge.
</p>

<p>
	What you are describing (mob rule) is barbarism. That will not end well.

<p>
	Don't forget the power of forgiveness.

	There exists no storage solution for radioactive nuclear waste. Think about that. You want to build radioactive material that will last for 10,000 years with no plan for what to do with it.

<p>
	That shit will leak into the ocean.

<p>
	Just start being creative again.

<p>
	As always, psychedelics help.

<p>

<p>
	And just imbibing more art and source material that inspires you.

<p>
	Travel is also good.

<p>
	How about we first exhaust solar and wind. Then if we still need more energy we can consider nuclear.
</p>

<p>
	In the long run solar is the ultimate energy source. We just need to scale it up massively.

<p>
	Very few Buddhists understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	Buddhism still has a lot of dogma in it. Even when people speak of the classical Buddhist enlightenment, they speak of it dogmatically, not from deep personal experience.
</p>

<p>
	And even if they've hadÂ some degree of awakening, it's still far shy of fullÂ God mode.
</p>

<p>
	So in practice 99.999% of Buddhists don't fully understand their own teachings.

	Yeah, but a lot of foolish peopleÂ have done mushrooms without realizing their full significance. So that means little.
</p>

<p>
	They have to be done in the right way with a proper theoretical understanding of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	An ideological or closedminded person doing mushrooms won't gain much from them, and could in fact go deeper into delusion.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that the very thing JP needs most now is stage Green compassion and community support.

<p>
	As a general rule I don't like to smoke anything to avoid harming the lungs.
</p>

<p>
	If I was gonna do weed, I would take a pure THC extract tincture sublingually.

<p>
	This is where it gets very problematic. The hive mind can be very ignorant and evil, and also easily manipulated by power hungry devils.

	We have to be careful not to ruin people's careers over minor gaffs and bits of foolishness.
</p>

<p>
	If he was a proper racist I would agree, kick him out of office. But I don't think that is the right reaction in this case.
</p>

<p>
	It is important that we allow room for public servants and celebrities to grow and mature. I like when a public figure is able to admit his past mistakes and grow from them. This is necessary in a society where people are self-actualizing. Otherwise no one will admit their mistakes because they will be too scared to get rejected or mauled by the hive mind.
</p>

<p>
	I think pubic figures should only be fired if they did something significantly bad and they refuse to accept responsiblity and grow from it.
</p>

<p>
	We don't want a society where we tar and feather people for minor offenses.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Trump deserves to be kicked out of office because he isÂ unapologetic about anything he does and he refuses to correct his ways. I don't think Trudeau isÂ in the same ballpark. I think this brown face scandal will make him a better person overall. He seems toÂ regretÂ his actions. These kind of scandals are actually helpful for the evolution of ourÂ culture as a consensus develops that blackface is hurtful and racist. Believe it or not, many people don't know that yet. People whoÂ did not grow up in the South aren't that familiar with blackface. For example, I never even heard that term until a few years ago.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No. Relative truth in this case would be for scientists to get to bottom of whether vaccines have any harmful side effects. If they do, that is a relative truth. If they don't, that is a relative truth.
</p>

<p>
	The solution here is simple: invest a lot more money studying the subtle side effects of vaccines with anÂ open mind. See what the research reveals. Or maybe just invent new vaccines which use less toxic substances in their creation. I hear some vaccines contaim stuff like mercury. Of that's true, that's probably harmful to folks. So find a way to make non-toxic vaccines.
</p>

<p>
	This is really a scientific problem. The trick is that we need much better science. Right now science is too materialistic and corrupted by corporate funding so it's hard to trust. You can appreciate why stage Greem hippies are skeptical of science. There is plenty of terrible scientific research on nutrition, for example. Nutrition science and drug science is very skewed by corporate money,Â lobbying, and fear-mongering.

<p>
	This is where you need to distinguish between relative truth vs absolute truth.
</p>

<p>
	Of course vaccines and children are imaginary in the absolute sense. But relatively speaking, there is a legit scientific question about whether vaccines cause negative health side effects. This question is yet to be settled, which is why people argue over it. But even once it is settled, in the absolute sense all of this is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: when you are writing a plot for a novel there arises the question of whether your plot is consistent with itself or self-contradictory. But either way, the entire thing is a work of imagination.

<p>
	I meant, it needs to be the most meaningful thing out of the things you could be working on.
</p>

<p>
	Unless you are a billionaire, you don't have a choice in life. You will have to work to make money. The only question is, will you work on things you find most meaningful or not?
</p>

<p>
	Even if you value deep relationships, you'll still have to work. Because work IS survival. You cannot be alive and avoid survival. The only question is, what will be the quality of your survival? Are you gonna be scamming old ladies out of their life savings, are you gonna be selling poison at McDonald's, or are you gonna do something meaningful for the world?
</p>

<p>
	Up to you.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be surprised if you hate your life when you sell poison at McDonald's for 8 hours every day. You <u>should</u> hate your life at that point because what you're doing is so stupid. That hate is a message that God is sending you. God is telling you, "Why you being so stupid when you could be doing something so much more amazing with your life?"
</p>

<p>
	Living life in stupid ways leads to lots of suffering.

	Exactly.

	Be careful throwing pearls before swine. Most people are not worthy to be told what spirituality is. They are too selfish to understand the communication.

<title>I can't accept the fact that I have to work in life, how can I change this?</title>

<p>
	You're thinking about work all wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than seeing is as something you have to do, find a way to make it something you love to do.
</p>

<p>
	In general, don't do things because you have to, do them because you want to.
</p>

<p>
	This means being proactive about your work. It's not really work then, it's creativity. Don't you want to be creative? Why not? You are God after all! You created the whole universe and creation is a beautiful and exciting process.
</p>

<p>
	You're disconnected from your creativity. That's your problem. Find a way to reconnect and this issue about work will dissolve. Then your problem will be that you work too hard!
</p>

<p>
	Your work needs to be the most meaningful thing in the world to you.
</p>

<p>
	You have yet to realize the significance of life purpose. You know it only as an intellectual abstraction, not a tangible burning passion.
</p>

<p>
	Best to keep dating and enlightenment separate pursuits.
</p>

<p>
	If you wanna date, go date.
</p>

<p>
	If you want enlightenment, go do enlightenment work.
</p>

<p>
	Dating is not about finding some Buddha to bang. You bang whoever you can and see where things go from there. Don't expect your partner to know anything about enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe if you're lucky you'll bump into a girl who meditates or does Hatha yoga. But even that is rare. And even then it will all just be surface level stuff.

<p>
	Whiting out would be past the point of disturbing. Disturbing comes first.
</p>

<p>
	If you're whiting out, you're going too far.

<p>
	Maybe you find some value in it, but I would call this too dangerous to repeat.

<p>
	To admit idealism is to admit that reality could all just be imaginary. What serious intellectual wants to do that? The whole appeal of being an intellectual is to take one's mind seriously.
</p>

<p>
	So it's a problem of the fox guarding the hen house.
</p>

<p>
	An academic cannot admit idealism because that then leads to mysticism and that then leads to the end of his career.
</p>

<p>
	People who discover mysticism either leave academia or don't enter it in the first place.

			He's using emotional detachment as an idealist dogma. 'Everything is a thought-story', blah blah blah. He forgets to apply his dogma on itself. There's an underlying fear and judgement beneath his detachment. It's based in the intellect, by rationalising everything in the world, including emotions, as mere thought-stories.

</p>

<p>
	Create a LP around your love for musi, not piano. This is a much broader notion than mastering piano. Love of music might not require you to play the piano at all.
</p>

<p>
	Think more outside the box. What are new ways you could sharing your love of music.
</p>

<p>
	Like maybe you could invent a new musical instrument, or whatever. Get creative here.

	Fear of being rejected, fear of blowing the chance.
</p>

<p>
	The hotter the girl, the more you put her on a pedestal, the more you feel you need to impress her.
</p>

<p>
	The trick to attracting hot girls is to treat them as if they are nobody special. And being a strong leader. This requires lots of practice.

Fake it a bit till you make it.
</p>

<p>
	Be more playful, more flirty, more proactive. Rub up on him, tease him, put your hands on him, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't rocket science. Don't ask how. Just do it. Learn to turn yourself on with your mind, and learn to turn him on.
</p>

<p>
	If you need to watch porn, watch porn and take notes. Although really this stuff is pretty obvious.
</p>

<p>
	A deeper issue you might have is shyness or fear of intimacy. Or perhaps you were raise in a family/culture which taught you to be ashamed of sex. In which case you're sexually repressed.
</p>

<p>
	How do you fix that? By questioning those old beliefs to death and pushing your comfort zone and exploring sexuality. Many books have been written about sex.
</p>

<p>
	Being good at sex isn't natural. It requires practice and training. Don't be afraid to practice and train. Go suck on a cucumber until you figure out a good way to do it. This kind of basic stuff is what women avoid, but it necessary if you want to get good. Don't expect good sex to happen automatically. You have to put energy and intention into it. You have to be interested in doing whatever it takes to make it good. This might mean buying books, videos, toys, courses, attending classes, watching porn, practicing, visualizing, talking with your partner, training with your partner, etc.

<p>
	Of course not.

<p>
	Male and female attraction is asymmetrical.

<p>
	They fantasize about some knight in shining armor whisking them away. Read some cheap romance novels from Walmart to understand how women think about sex/relationships. That cheap romance novel from Walmart is a woman's version of porn.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			And generally, how important are looks for women in a relationship compared to men?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Much less important. A woman is looking for strength and leadership qualities, not looks.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if all else is equal, she will pick the guy with better looks. But in practice all else is never equal. This is why a guy with below average looks can attract girls with above average looks. He compensates for it with strong inner qualities. The nice thing about this is that it's possible to cultivate these strong inner qualities. The bad thing is, this involves serious emotional labor.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense being a hot girl is easy because you don't have do anything. You wear your value on your sleeve. The downside of this is that if you're not a hot girl (and definition most girls aren't), it's almost impossible to change that. So men have more flexibility in this department. But in practice very few men actualize this possibility.
</p>

<p>
	Most people end up settling for someone at roughly their level of reproductive value.
