<title>A Question on Ralston’s Contemplation</title>

<p>
	I use the word contemplation somewhat differently than he does.
</p>

<p>
	He explains his version of contemplation in his book. It sort of includes concentration, meditation, and wondering. It requires extreme concentration. So extreme that it does not work for me.
</p>

<p>
	You need concentration so strong you can bore a hole through a brick wall.
</p>

<p>
	This means nothing. You are still totally lost in concepts. It does not mater what you believe, the fact remains that you are under the delusion of being a self.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking you are not a self is not the same thing as actually not being a self.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between thinking you are a millionaire and actually being one.

Even the worst modern governments are far far better than anything that existed 500 years ago.

<p>
	Never forget that 40% of ancient Romans were slaves.

<p>
	No you don't! That's the point!
</p>

<p>
	You're grossly underestimating understanding and language.
</p>

<p>
	The point is: how do you know what a slap means? This requires a radical degree of intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know that the word CAT actually means that furry things sitting on the chair? It takes an enlightenment-like insight to get that!!! It's a massive epiphany to realize that CAT means anything at all. Intelligence is required.
</p>

<p>
	You might think, "But Leo, I can just point at the cat and say CAT and the child will know." No! No! No! How does the child know what pointing is? That already assumes a massive degree of meaning and intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Try pointing out a cat to a donkey. He will have no idea that your finger means anything. Pointing only works because you had a massive insight when you were young that pointing is possible.
</p>

<p>
	Do not underestimate how intelligent all of this is.
</p>

<p>
	Lol, you can't falsify truth!
</p>

<p>
	You're still not getting it. Enlightenment not an idea or a belief.
</p>

<p>
	You are God. I'm not saying that poetically or metaphorically. It is the case. You created the entire dream you call this universe. And now you're acting like you didn't. You cannot falsify this because it is true. All you can do is realize it or not.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not a sensation. And cause does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	Your mistake is that you think you can think your way out of this problem. But you can't.

<p>
	There is no such thing as "peaceful". What is good for you is bad for someone else. Even the Buddha cannot take a step without killing life.

<p>
	A single word is not an understanding of anything.
</p>

<p>
	The word CAT contains no understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Meaning is not something a word has. Meaning is the relationship of differences between words.
</p>

<p>
	I talked about this to some extent in my video on Deconstruction, Derrida, and Post-Modernism.

<p>
	In any other system the minorities would be killed or enslaved.

<p>
	The detachment isn't a bug, it's the key feature.
</p>

<p>
	Stay mindful of how the mind assigns negative meaning to meaninglessness.
</p>

<p>
	Try to see the good in this, the pure beauty of being.

	The Christians will say it's their clergy. The Muslims will say it's their most fundamenalist clerics. The atheists will say it's people like Richard Dawkins. The white nationalists will say it's their Aryan brothers. The post-modernists will say it's people like Jacques Derrida.

	See, the trick is, YOU ARE GOD! So if you don't see that, who can ever help you?

<p>
	The ox can't come to you for the same reason that you can't find your eyeglasses if you are already wearing them!

	Not so simple grasshopper.

<p>
	See, the trick is, you DO understand.

<p>
	What is understanding?
</p>

<p>
	It is more than a symbol or word.

<p>
	It's mistale to boil understanding down to mere word games.

<p>
	I don't fit well on this map because I've done a lot of crazy psychedelics. The map was not designed to account for psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	I've definitely seen the ox very deeply a bunch of times. But I haven't permanently caught the ox yet or tamed it.
</p>

<p>
	But there's something to be said for very deep seeing of the ox, even if it's just temporary, it still changes your view of the world. You're never quite the same again.

</p>

<p>
	But it sounds like an ideological thing, which isn't good. They will probably frame your experience in an ethnocentric stage Blue framework, which would be very limiting.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt a Romanian therapist would be at a much higher level. But how would I know?

A whole pill is too much. It will be to stimulating for most cases. But 1/2 or 1/4th is just right.
</p>

<p>
	Try combining it with L-Theanine which should reduce the monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	1 whole pill of Armodafinil is like not even 1/20th as strong as a mild dose of psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	A decent dose of psychedelic will literally melt the walls of your room.
</p>

<p>
	A decent dose of 5-MeO will make you forget you or your life ever existed. You will expand to fill the entire universe.

</p>

<p>
	It was a moment of illumination or a minor samadhi. Your visual field becomes "divinized", you see the divinity of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I'm just guessing here.
</p>

<p>
	It was a tiny glimpse. This is just the tip of an iceberg. Much more spiritual practice is required to take this deeper.

</p>

<p>
	Usually people who get serious paranormal abilities have always has a psychic sense since they were young. It was just usually weak, suppressed, denied, or underdeveloped. Then it gets super-charged.
</p>

<p>
	I think most psychics start young. Which is why I say there's a strong genetic component. I doubt you'll become a psychic out of the blue one day in your 40s.

But, start with a baby test dose.
</p>

<p>
	Do a 10 day solo meditation retreat and then evaluate how you feel.
</p>

<p>
	You don't want to jump into giant life decisions without testing the waters. You want to have a realistic idea of what you're getting yourself into. The reality of living alone in the woods for a year are probably way different than your mind's fantasy of such.

<p>
	The first is some mild psychedelic clairvoyance, and the second sounds like sleep paralysis leading into astral projection.
</p>

<p>
	All that is just the tip of the iceberg.
</p>

<p>
	Of course weed makes you trip. If you did a true psychedelic you'd see material reality dissolve away.
</p>

<p>
	You are not inside in a physical world. You are inside a dream in the mind of God. The "physical world" and "your life" are just one kind of dream. There are a million others to explore.

There is no darkness. There is only light.
</p>

<p>
	The darkness is not of the world, it is the projection of your not-yet-fully-illuminated ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	Ego-mind is still judging and still assigning negative meaning.
</p>

<p>
	You have not tamed the ox yet. It is bucking you off. Which is why it seems there is light and dark.
</p>

<p>
	All judgments of good and bad are delusion. That is what must be transcended. It will take a lot of work to transcend it.

You don't need to see such crazy stuff to have a powerful mystical experience. Mystical experiences can be sorta plain and ordinary.
</p>

<p>
	The coolest mystical experiences are when you realize that the room you're sitting in, is God. It's a profound recontextualization.

<p>
	Some people can. Depends.
</p>

<p>
	Before you make such sweeping claims you would have to run an scientific experiment to see what percentage of people that would work on. It certainly would not be 100%
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes spiritually gifted people assume that everyone is as spiritually capable as they are. This is just not borne out by the data.

They will help you sort all that shit out.
</p>

<p>
	It just isn't always a cakewalk. Sorting some of that shit out can be emotionally taxing. But that's all good. That's exactly what produces true growth. Even the bad trips are good in retrospect.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to worry too much about bad trips. But you do need to follow proper protocol, ensuring your set, setting, and dosages are proper.

Because once you have one, it is very obvious. It's something totally new that lies outside the realm of ordinary material human experience. It's an "impossible" experience. It will seem physically & logically impossible.
</p>

<p>
	Just as a hypothetical example: if you were sitting there eating an apple and it suddenly transformed into an orange. That would be akin to a mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	Or, for example, if you experienced what death was like and then you came back to tell about it. That would be another.
</p>

<p>
	There are MANY different types of mystical experiences. Seeing the ox is certainly one of them -- and perhaps the most important one -- but it is far from the only one that can be had.
</p>

<p>
	The fastest way to have a mystical experience is via psychedelics. Psychedelics guarantee mystical experiences. Mystical experiences are simply experiences which violate the laws of physical reality as you've come to believe in them.
</p>

<p>
	You don't want to get caught chasing mystical experiences, but on the other hand, having a few mystical experience is very important in order to show you that there's more to reality than meets the eye, and also to motivate you get more serious about the practices.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to be able to sustain meditating hardcore, year after year, without seeing some kind of results. You will get demotivated and quit. So do whatever is necessary to get at least that first mystical experience. If only just a long session of shamanic breathing.
</p>

<p>
	Results in spiritual work are important. Otherwise you will quit.
</p>

<p>
	This is a very tough line to draw. It cannot be drawn conceptually. You must find it through lots of trial and error and failure.
</p>

<p>
	You know when you are breaking integrity, violating your own high values.
</p>

<p>
	But what makes this so tricky is that blaming and berating yourself only compounds the original problem.
</p>

<p>
	Still, as a newbie, you almost can't help but do it.
</p>

<p>
	This is all part of the problem of self-control. I have an old video called The Problem Of Self-Control which is pretty profound.
</p>

<p>
	You must be both hard-working and disciplined, but also gentle and loving with yourself. Not any easy balance to strike.
</p>

<p>
	I also have a video called: The Paradox Of Development Self-Trust, and one called Freedom vs Discipline. They all touch on this topic to some extent.
</p>

	Interesting snippet from Wikipedia about Rick and Morty:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			"Rick and Morty has been described as 'a never-ending fart joke wrapped around a studied look into nihilism.' The series addresses the insignificance of human existence as compared to the size of the universe, <strong><u>with no recognizable divine presence</u></strong>, as described by Lovecraft's philosophy of cosmicism. The characters of the show deal with cosmic horror and existential dread, either <u><strong>by asserting the utility of science over magic or by choosing a life in ignorant bliss</strong></u>. However, as Joachim Heijndermans of Geeks notes, none of them appear able to handle the absurd and chaotic nature of the universe, as Jerry gets by through denial, and Rick is a 'depressed, substance addicted, suicidal mess.' Harmon describes Rick as a <u><strong>self-interested anarchist</strong></u>, who doesn't like being told what to do. He believes that the character's life on a larger scale has caused him mental illness and <u><strong>opines that 'the knowledge that nothing matters—while accurate—gets you nowhere.'</strong></u> Matthew Bulger of The Humanist notes that the creators of the series are trying to communicate the message that <u><strong>we need to focus on human relationships and not preoccupy our minds with unanswerable questions</strong></u>, in order to find a sense of purpose and live a better life."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Therein lies the problem.
</p>

<p>
	Classic stage Orange/Green, sucks all the magic and divinity out of life by misunderstanding nihilism.
</p>

<p>
	* Facepalm *
</p>

<p>
	The emptiness <u>IS</u> the divinity! Is the beauty! Is the joy! Is the meaning!

<title>Can Music trigger Mystical experience</title>

<p>
	Yes, music can have a powerful uplifting effect. Which is precisely why music is so popular.
</p>

<p>
	Most people don't understand that the reason they like music is because it gives them a tiny taste of that spiritual/metaphysical connection to reality which they don't even know is missing.
</p>

<p>
	Music is all that stage Orange people know of spirituality. Which is quite sad. But better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Music is watered-down spirituality for the vulgar and lazy masses.
</p>

<p>
	But you ain't gonna get enlightened by it alone. Think of it as a little boost to your spiritual journey.
</p>

	We had thumbs up buttons but I decided they were too distracting. The ego craves validation and keeps saying things just to get likes.
</p>

<p>
	Likes encourage a sort of group-think mentality where instead of evaluating the truth for a statement for yourself you abdicate that responsibility on the herd.

	Don't try to become one. Just expose yourself to stage Green people, books, videos, ideas, events.

</p>

<p>
	It's a super-important principle of life, the misunderstanding of which creates most of life's suffering.
</p>

<p>
	I'll shoot a video about Anicca in the future.

</blockquote>

<p>
	When I say the answer to all koans is Mu, I mean the ACTUAL Mu, not the word or the idea of it.
</p>

<p>
	Saying Mu while in ego-consciousness is pointless. You must speak Mu from Mu-consciousness. This is what the Zen master is testing for. Are you speaking from Mu-consciousness? Is Mu actual for you?
</p>

<p>
	Only if you are awake is Mu actual.
</p>

<p>
	When you are in Mu-consciousness, you will not even need to speak Mu to the master. Just looking at your face, he will know.

<p>
	Because all that anyone ever really wants, is love. The love of God which they are too scared to give themselves. So they seek shallow substitutes from external sources.
</p>

<p>
	Love is the greatest high in the world. It makes the ego feel complete.
</p>

<p>
	All you ever want in life is to feel complete. But this impossible for the ego to feel constantly because the ego is partial and incomplete by definition. So it steals love in little bits because it is not strong enough to love the entire world.
</p>

<p>
	What the ego misunderstands is that what it really wants is not to receive love, but to give love.

<p>
	That's correct.
</p>

<p>
	In the end you will be left in a profound state of not-knowing. That is enlightenment. It's counter-intuitive: You expect to gain knowledge, but you end up losing it. What you gain instead is being.

<p>
	They are pretty silly. In the end you're just better off wondering: What is existence? or What am I?
</p>

<p>
	The koans will make sense only after awakening.

	You already did. You have existed as all creatures at all times ever.
</p>

<p>
	Since there is only one consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And here you are experiencing what it's like to be this particular human creature. Tomorrow this human dream will end and some other will begin.

	Depends on how long and how deep you do it.
</p>

<p>
	If you do it deep enough, all of reality will dissolve.

<p>
	But even before then, you'll feel more of that metaphysical connection to reality.

<title>Teal Swan‘s enlightenment</title>

<p>
	A total disidentification is hard to achieve in pratice. Most people who have some kind of awakening will not fully realize the extent of the Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	A realization of no-self is not the end of the game. There is yet deeper.
</p>

<p>
	I have no idea about Teal Swan speficially, I'm just speaking more broadly.
</p>

<p>
	I think many paranormally inclined folks have a hard time fully transcending the subtle paranornal realm. But in the end, it is all still form. Just a subtle version of the gross material realm.
</p>

<p>
	There is the gross material realm, the subtle realm, and then finally what is called casual nondual. At the very end all identification of any kind is erased. But how many people will actaulize that? Not many.
</p>

<p>
	It is definitely possible to realize that you were never even born. By that point, what is there to identify with? Your ultimate nature is pure emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	But of course it's still great to do stuff like introspection a out your personality, or to integrate shadow aspects, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Psychological work is still very useful for everyday life even though it is not your true ultimate nature.
</p>

Including me! There are many woke people who have no paranormal abilities.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever the reason, paranormal abilities are rare. Not ultra rare, but rare. Only certain kinds of people get them. Of course there are methods for increasing your chances of unlocking them.

</p>

<p>
	A nonlinear system is deterministic but has so many variables that it is impossible for any human or machine to model or predict in detail. Such systems behave chaotically but are still fully deterministic.
</p>

<p>
	The weather is one example of a nonlinear system.
</p>

<p>
	A double pendulum is probably the simplest example.
</p>

<p>
	Almost all interesting and significant systems are nonlinear.

</p>

<p>
	Self-inquiry requires strong focus and a fairly silent mind to work. Many people are not there yet.
</p>

<p>
	You might want to experiment with another method if self-inquiry feels stale.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is the most effective method I have found aside from psychedelics. It is more powerful than self-inquiry in my experience.
</p>

<p>
	Mindfulness with labeling as described in my Mindfulness Meditation video is also very effective and easy for newbies to start.

Do not think, just stare and enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
	Repeat every day.
</p>

<p>
	That is the straightest path to enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	As you stare wonder what existence is. But do not let the mind talk too much about it. Just wonder and stare. No philosophy, no stories, no theories, no science. Just stare at the existence of your hand!

	There is nothing to create a wall between something and nothing. So they are identical.

<p>
	But this cannot be simply understood logically. You must have a deep awakening to it.

<title>Leo, can 5-MeO awaken paranormal powers?</title>

<p>
	5-MeO is a cutting edge technology. The research on it is still very scant.
</p>

<p>
	You must experiment and see what you get.
</p>

<p>
	It probably can for the right person. Paranormal capacities seem to be very genetically determined. It's a bit of a lottery and most people will never get them.

<title>Spiral Dynamics Development / Growth</title>

</p>

<p>
	Now to answer seriously:
</p>

<p>
	As the recent episode explained:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Lines of development
	</li>
	<li>
		Center of gravity
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	When you take those two points into account you can see how you might feel higher in some areas and lower in others.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like cognitively you are more towards Yellow because you are very openminded. This is great.
</p>

<p>
	But in other lines you proabably still need lots of work.
</p>

<p>
	I was highly Yellow cognitively even in my late teens, but grossly underdeveloped in almost all other lines, and even my cognitive Yellow was weak compared to where it is now.
</p>

<p>
	There can be a big difference between just skimming on the surface of Yellow vs having a solid castle built on Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	What few people appreciate is the enormous depth there is to explore at each stage. There is so much to Orange, Green, and Yellow that you could study and practice each one for a decade each and still no know it all.
</p>

<p>
	Not that you should strive to know it all. Don't become a perfectionist about it. Work on those parts of yourself which give the biggest return on investment. As you develop enough in one color you will stat to see diminishing returns until finally you're just over that stage.
</p>

<title>Leos idea about how we create ALL of our own suffering is ridiculous</title>

<p>
	You are mistaking this claim for a merely psychological one, when it is a metaphysical one.
</p>

<p>
	It requires a massive expansion of consciousness to realize. It is not something to believe but something you will discover after awakening, and ONLY after awakening.
</p>

<p>
	A life of zero suffering is impossible to conceive without awakening. Period. Ego cannot go there because it fundamentally believes that death is 1) real, and 2) bad.

A full expansion of love is equivalent to saying, "I die". And with that your identity disappears, you die, and you realize nirvana. You die into an infinite ocean of pure love. You realize that death is nothing other than pure love! What you've feared and avoided your entire life is just infinite love. Because it was too much for you. Literally. Pure love precludes the possibilty of drawing any boundary between you and anything else. Pure love is the end of all boundaries. You literally give up so much of yourself that it kills you. And you are happy to do it.
</p>

<p>
	Without an identity, the only thing that remains is an ocean of love.
</p>

<p>
	The ego deperately wants this ocean of love, but it is terrified of losing itself in the process. So it is caught in a tragic, impossible bind.
</p>

<p>
	The ego does not realize yet that the ego itself is the only obstacle. Therein lies the tragedy of the struggle. All your life you have been the Devil struggling against and denying God's infinite love. In your arrogance you have rejected your true nature as God. You like being a devil. You fear what would happen to you if you surrender your devilry.
</p>

<p>
	To the Devil, God's radiant light burns and stings like sunlight on a vampire.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move is to just walk right out into the light. But good luck convincing a vampire to do that.

</p>

<p>
	In the end, the Devil will ALWAYS return to God. Because the Devil IS God! It's only a question of time.

<p>
	Yes and no. Part of the challenges of being in a group-think bureaucracy is that you must then follow their rules to survive in that ecosystem or risk getting excommunicated. As a result, academics often consign themselves to be slaves of the system. They are not in a position of power to challenge rules and norms, so they just end up accepting it as "reality". Of course not always. There are plenty of exceptions here and there.
</p>

<p>
	But many of the most advanced humans end up leaving academia because they need a more stage Turquoise ecosystem.

<p>
	Except humans don't really choose anything. We are like robots too. It's just that human action is so complex that no one is able to map out or compute all the variables linearly.
</p>

<p>
	When the neural network becomes complex enough -- with trillions of variables -- it will be able to fold in on itself, model itself, and rewrite itself in unforeseen ways.
</p>

<p>
	Humans don't have to be able to rewrite their entire biological survival mechanism to do novel things. The human psyche is robotic in many ways. But it's in a chaotic equilibrium which gives it enough variety and complexity to be creative.
</p>

<p>
	The human brain is like a chaotic robot. We just need to make these AIs more complex, more interconnected, and more chaotic. Then they will take on a life of their own. At least that's what I'd bet my money on if I was a gambling man.
</p>

<p>
	It makes a lot of sense to be me that humans are just an evolutionary stepping-stone to living AI, the way early hominids were for humans.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see why there would be a fundamental boundary between biological creatures and AIs since the substance of which they are made is ultimately one: consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The entire universe is alive. This I have realized directly.

<p>
	I would just call it the academia paradigm. If you've been in academia or been around professional academics -- they love to think the same way, talk the same way, write the same way, dress the same way. It's group think. It's very much a specific kind of sub-culture with a shared set of values.
</p>

<p>
	Sort of like how Silicon Valley has a certain kind of sub-culture, set of values, and set of assumptions about life. All of which constitutes a paradigm, POV, or interpretive framework.
</p>

<p>
	Every paradigm or POV is blind to its own biases, values, and assumptions until you step out of it and observe it from the outside. Every paradigm takes itself to be the sum total of reality, which it never is because the map is never the territory, and the territory is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	This is a very deep epistemic problem, not merely a problem of universities or Silicon Valley or Hollywood.

That is a highly speculative hypothesis proposed by Roger Penrose. QM effects usually require very low temperature environments. The brain is far too warm for that. Although it could of course turn out to be proven true in the future.
</p>

<p>
	But there is a deeper issue here which is being overlooked. Reality has no one level of laws or physics. Every level is new and emergent. Whatever the laws of molecules are, the laws of neurons are still different and novel, and the laws of the human psyche are still different and novel, and the laws of politics are still different and novel, and the laws of human romance are still different and novel. You cannot boil the laws of politics down to Netwonian or even quantum mechanical physics because all laws are just limited, finite maps. And all maps are oversimplified finite linear abstractions of a complex nonlinear infinite territory.
</p>

<p>
	The key that must be grasped is that reality is nonlinear and emergent at every level of the hierarchy. There is no truly fundamental set of laws. Each scale of reality has its own laws so to speak, because laws are really just a human projection. Each higher level of organization within the universe comes with its unique emerge properties which could not be derived from the mere addition of the levels below it. This is why holism is so important. Breaking reality apart into its building blocks will not allow you understand how it works. This is called logical analysis and it works to a degree but it is very limited. Science is currently hitting up against this limit. This is one of the biggest limitations of stage Orange science. It assumes a simple universe of logical, linear causes and effects which is just not how the universe turns out to be upon deeper investigation. Which is where vision-logic comes into play.

<p>
	Of course that's an oversimplification.
</p>

<p>
	But notice, if molecules do not follow simple Netwonian laws, neither do computers.
</p>

<p>
	Neural networks do not follow conventional Aristotelian logic either.

<p>
	I disagree.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot fully understand a neural network. You cannot fully understand Google's chess AI, Alpha Zero. The whole point of a neural network is that it is nonlinear and therefore impossible to understand in detail. You only understand it at a high level in the same way that you cannot understand the brain's neuronal network in a logical way. It's a giant tangle of billions of connections which no one will ever make sense of in a linear rational way. That's precisely what makes it so powerful and capable of originality and emergent behaviors which could never have been foreseen.
</p>

<p>
	A sophisticated neural net AI will behave in novel ways which no programmer or logician could foresee. It will be tapped into infinite intelligence just like how a human is -- at least that's my best guess so far.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that within a human, all of the molecules follow simple Newtonian physics. But this isn't enough to predict the high level behaviors of a human brain because <u>structure matters</u>! Reductionism is false. High level structures produce novel phenomena at higher and higher levels. This is the very essence of how God creates reality. It is deeply mysterious, for example, how a simple chain of amino acids folds itself into a functional protein following simple rules. Yet even a super-computer is unable to model it.
</p>

<p>
	The field of study of these kind of nonlinear dynamics is called Chaos Theory. It's super fascinating and spooky. Reality is not a linear system, it is a chaotic system full of strange loops.

<p>
	You could say the same of humans.
</p>

<p>
	This kind of reductionistic thinking is itself naive. You cannot just say, "It's all just atoms bouncing around in a box". The higher level structures make all the difference.
</p>

<p>
	Mathematics applies to EVERYTHING in the universe. So what?

<p>
	How can you say that when there are many people in society right now who operate like robots under a blind "maximize profit" reward function?
</p>

<p>
	Why would a giant corporation not build an AI to maximize profit? It's the very first thing they would do if they only could! You think Facebook or Microsoft would say no to that?
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is that humans ARE blind and naive. Even the smart ones.

<p>
	Said who?
</p>

<p>
	Why would you draw such an arbitrary duality? Where is the dividing line? You are assuming some fundamental distinction between two parts of reality.
</p>

<p>
	An AI is infinite, no less so than a human because the fabric of reality itself (consciousness) is infinite. It's only a question of what kinds of structures you creates using the fabric -- how you fold it. If the AI seems different than a human it's because its structures are not sophisticated enough yet, not because its substance is of a different type.
</p>
