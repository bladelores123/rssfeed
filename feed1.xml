	Sounds like you got low self-esteem issues.

	You gotta be the prize in the relationship. Not her the prize. You are falling into the classic trap of making her the prize.

Own your manhood. Being a man is not necessarily about who you are, but who you're destined to become. See yourself as a lion!

<p>
	I sound like a broken record, but psychedelics can fix that pretty quick.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you can be intimate without necessarily dredging up old traumas and things. Not sure why you're so eager to go into that. I mean, she's not your therapist. She doesn't need to know every weakness you had in the past.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like you're trying to build negative intimacy when you could just focus on building positive intimacy.
</p>

<p>
	If everything is awesome now, what's the point of delving back into the past?

</p>

<p>
	I think your problem would simply be solved if you developed a couple new paths forwards weekly socialization. Like a group of friends you hang out with or play games with.
</p>

<p>
	You can find local meet up groups through MeetUp.com
</p>

<p>
	Stop wallowing at home and go meet some people. Action is required here. Then see how you feel.

			I have a question for you: Nowadays I mostly watch your content and Matt Kahn's, I feel like Matt Kahn is the heart and you are the mind, to love you don't need to understand and sometimes I question myself if I should take one approach or the other, since being in my feminine seems to be much easier than understanding all the complexities of the mind, <u>do you think at some point you will be more heart centered as you approach enlightment or your style will still be very rational?</u>
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Actually, Understanding IS Love.
</p>

<p>
	How can you Love when you don't understand what Love is?
</p>

<p>
	Matt's style will resonate a lot more with feminine females than mine will.
</p>

<p>
	My style will evolve. But my bias is towards understanding stuff. Every teacher has his biases. Find what works for you.

<p>
	No only that, but the vaccine will take months and even a year to fully roll out, so you will hear about any side-effects from real-world victims.
</p>

<p>
	There's no way the side-effects will remain secret. It will all happen out in the open. If people die, we'll see it. You won't even have access to the vaccine until millions of other people get it before you.
</p>

<p>
	But the idea that people will be dying from this vaccine is absurd. It's not gonna happen in any significant degree. But people die from Covid something like 1-3%.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality" rel="external nofollow">https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality</a>
</p>

<p>
	And Covid has many other harmful effects beyond 1-3% death rate. You could easily lose $10,000 in hospital bills alone!
</p>

<p>
	There's just no comparison. The vaccine is 10000% better. And the sooner people understand this, the sooner our economy can recover.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course there could. But you must weight that against the very well-documented serious side-effects of Covid.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is considering risk in isolation from other risks. The question is always one of the difference between two risks, not any one risk by itself.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps the greatest risk of all is the damage to the economy if we do not stop this virus dead-cold within a year. This will harm billions of people. The economy cannot return to normal without stopping this virus. Pretending like the virus does not exist will not work. We can't just will our way back to normal.

<p>
	There are serious side-effects to owning a stove. So what?
</p>

<p>
	You're using ridiculous logic. A million people will die without a vaccine. This is not speculation. It's already half-way there.
</p>

<p>
	No technology is perfect. But given the mess we are in right now, we don't need anything close to perfect. We just need something better than 1 million deaths and a 10 year depression.
</p>

<p>
	So far the most common side-effect of the Pfizzer vaccine is like 7% of people get fatigue.
</p>

<p>
	Governance is never about perfection, it's about minimizing harm and risk in reasonable ways. AKA, strategy.
</p>

<p>
	Even if the vaccine killed 0.01% of people, it would still be worth taking. But the vaccine will be much much safer than that.

	Except the problem there is that it's the parents' whose survival needs are being met there while the survival needs of the partners is often being ignored.
</p>

<p>
	You're dealing with 4 competing survival needs there: husband, husband's parents, wife, wife's parents. Which makes for a very loaded political game. It will be difficult for Truth and Love to compete with all those interests.

			The thing is food production and waste has to get REDUCED in rich countries. Then use the machines and fertilizers used there to support local food production in poorer countries. Yet, you can't copy exsisting forms of agriculture 1:1, but have to adjust them to the soil and climate in those countries. One of the problems is that, for example in Africa, countries are distributed on different latitudes and every latitiude can differ quite a lot in climate.

<p>
	This kind of stuff requires higher forms of world government which even America and Europe is not yet ready for.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that you can just treat the whole world as one giant collection of humans and just distribute resources to whoever needs it << we don't live in such a world, not politically. The world is deeply divided and tribal still. Which creates all sorts of inequalities that cannot be easily equalized from one part to another.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Help from outside can work. It just has is limits.
</p>

<p>
	The country has to develop to a higher point on the Spiral, which takes hundreds of years. Any country Orange and below will have crippling poverty. We at least need stage Green. And people love to hate Green these days even in developed countries. Which shows you the depth of our problem.
</p>

<p>
	Poverty is not really a farming or shipping problem, it's a mental development problem. It's a catch-22. You need better access to food to increase mental development. But you need high mental development to create better access to food. So there is a lot of struggle and slippage as the process tries to bootstrap itself.

<p>
	That's questionable in a relationship context.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is the ego loves to co-opt spirituality and consciousness for survival. It's a very deceptive and murky process.
</p>

<p>
	Is there something like a genuine connection with another human? Yes. But it is wrapped in layers of survival stuff which will always linger.
</p>

<p>
	But hey, I'm sick of preaching this stuff. Go contemplate how your dating and relationships truly work for yourselves. If you dare.
</p>

<p>
	Consider this: the only reason you guys follow me is because it gives you survival value. As soon as my ability to give you value disappears, you will leave me or hate me. Yet in your minds you don't think of it that way. In your minds you think you really appreciate me for who I am. Of course this is pure fantasy. You don't really care who I am. If I was Hitler, you would want me killed. Such is life. Accept it and move on.

<p>
	All you have to do to see that your romance is completely self-biased and survival based is to contemplate why you don't get romantic with a gorilla. There is absolutely no reason why you should relate with humans more than gorillas other than survival.
</p>

<p>
	Absolutely everything involving sex is pure self-bias. Why do you not hump a light-post? Sex is COMPLETELY arbitrary and relative. And the only reason you do it is because it has survival value for the species.
</p>

<p>
	But don't get me wrong. This doesn't mean you can't have deep intimate relationships. You can! Just stop fooling yourself about what it is you're doing. You are using those relationships to enhance your survival. You are doing that without admitting you are doing it. Self-deception 101.

			You're right but i think labelling relationships as just completely and utterly a big, swirling survival game sort of muddles the water between conscious vs unconscious, healthy vs unhealthy, decent vs indecent relationships. It gives you a free pass to be a dick and view women red pillish. Because hey its all a big toxic ego game anyway right? Being a dick is just survival! And this mindset isnt good for you, let alone the woman.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Except that's your projection, not anything I said.
</p>

<p>
	Relationships are survival. But saying so does not devalue the relationship in any way. It's just being honest about what you're doing. People get the very wrong idea here that I am anti deep relationships. Not at all. You can do deep intimate relationships with consciousness and spiritual aspects. But it's still a survival game.
</p>

<p>
	People love the illusion of it not being a game. It makes the ego feel justified in its raw survival. The ego needs to paint a pretty story about how all of its purely arbitrary survival needs and manipulations are in fact legit, pure, good, honest, truthful, and selfless. Women especially fall into this illusion and they really upset when it is pointed out them.
</p>

<p>
	Both men and women are selfish as devils when it comes to sex. The selfishness is asymmetrical, with each side denying their own particular brand of selfishness while being outraged by the selfishness of the opposite side. And all of this is, of course, just more selfishness! And all of this is, of course, denied with great passion and fury.
</p>

<p>
	It would be much simpler if you just came out and said: "I am a selfish devil and I want sex under conditions X, Y, Z because that's what serves me best." But of course you cannot do that because it harms your survival. Your community will judge you for it and you can't stomach admitting to yourself just how selfish you are. So you must keep all your true motivations and conditions secret, even from yourself.

<p>
	Careful, not all dicks who mistreat women are PUAs. That's a very problematic conflation.
</p>

<p>
	Ordinary guys mistreat more women than all the PUAs in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Guys with poor dating and poor social skills are not angels. They creep women out big-time.
</p>

<p>
	Let's not pretend that a non-PUA will not manipulate women. He certainly will, just with less skill.

That's like shooting fish in a barrel. The perfect cover to ply your art.
</p>

<p>
	Many people get laid from their jobs, simply by having the right jobs which offer automatic socialization opportunities. And of course they use this to their advantage to snipe the best targets. This is like a socially acceptable form of pickup.

<p>
	That's precisely how ignorance works. An ignorant person feels he has the whole world figured out. Hence the tragedy of it.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I said a conspirscy theory is a dumb person's idea of intelligence. Analogous to how Trump is a poor person's idea of a rich person. They don't know what genuine wealth or strength looks like.

<p>
	You have a naive understanding of how politics works. When you are leading a giant nation, all sorts of evils will happen and mistakes will be made.
</p>

<p>
	Have you considered how many people would have been killed without the drone strikes? What the alternatives to drone strikes are?
</p>

<p>
	See, when you sit at home and judge others, that's easy. When you are put in charge of the world's largest military and tasked to defend Americans, that's a whole new ballgame. Don't forget, they will replace you with someone more bloodthirsty if you don't make them feel defended.
</p>

<p>
	The rules for world leaders are not the same rules as middle school. Death is baked into every decision you make at that scale.
</p>

<p>
	A naive stage Green does not appreciate such politcal complexities. It just wants peace to magically happen. This is the biggest problem with progressives. They act like all this is so easy, and then of course they complain and pout when they can barely win power in a real world election. Much easier to be right in your own head vs making things happen in a world full of selfish devils who want to eat you alive.
</p>

<p>
	Obama is a butcher compared to a middle school teacher. But that is the wrong comparison.
</p>

It's no one's job to be your crying pillow (other than a pro).
</p>

<p>
	You can do a bit of that with your partner, but if you do it too much, you're really being inconsiderate of them.

<p>
	I mean, do whatever you want. Push it to the breaking point if you want. I'm just giving you rules of thumb for happy relationships.

<p>
	If it was so easy, we would have done it a long time ago.
</p>

<p>
	It's a super complex political and systemic issue. It's not simply a matter of food delivery. Many people in poverty have serious mental health issues. How you gonna magically solve that? You give them food, they will sell it to buy crack. You give them food, a local warlord will bully it away from them to sell. Delivering free food to many of the worst countries is impossible because local dictators, mafias, and warlords will not allow it.

			Whats your view on professing spiritual love, being honest about your insecurities/fears, and showing weakness as a form of vulnerability to a girl you've been with for 8 months?

<p>
	8 months, then sure, no problem if you do it right.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not sure. That need has never arisen for me.
</p>

<p>
	If I cry in front of a woman it's tears of spiritual joy, not depression. And they love that.
</p>

<p>
	It also depends on how much you're crying. If you do it rarely, like once a month, no problem at all. If you do it every day, that could become a problem.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I think it depends on the girl. If she's in love with you, then you can probably get away with it. Although if you wallow in negativity and weakness for weeks and months on end, she may start to lose attraction. But again, this depends on the girl. Some girls will stick around no matter what, even if you beat her. Usually, once a girl falls in love with you, she's pretty damn committed to you. It takes a lot to repel her at that point.

			Is it all a game? Is there no time and place for this and I'm just killing attraction and killing our vibe every-time I'm honest? Or does a higher consciousness relationship require this level of vulnerability and honesty?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, it's not all a game. You can drop most of the game once she's in love with you. But of course she will still always have her own needs and desires. No one wants to be around a chronically depressed person.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be afraid to be REAL in a deep committed relationship. That will actually deepen the bond. But also, take care of yourself man. Don't use women to be your emotional tampons. It's your responsibility as a guy to handle your emotions.

<p>
	Or how about be of some service to mankind and earn some coin?
</p>

<p>
	This idea that money is evil while begging for food is noble is absurd and needs to be jettisoned. It certainly does not work in modern develop countries. Maybe it worked 2000 years ago.

<p>
	Don't frame it like that.
</p>

<p>
	You are just holding back your raging neediness and being a cool, chill guy.
</p>

<p>
	There are certain unspoken protocols to dating and attraction. It's like a mating dance. You must dance in a certain way or you mess it up. You would never text the girl, "Hey, let's bang", even if you two both want it, because that breaks the protocols of the dance. You must proceed slowly and not just dump all your cards on the table. She doesn't want that. She wants you to attract her in a smooth and natural manner so she doesn't feel like a slut. And you must demonstrate to her that you're a high value guy. And a high value guy never professes his spiritual love for a girl he hasn't even slept with.
</p>

<p>
	It will be a delicate balancing act. I'm not making these changes to attract more viewers, but to give the work a higher caliber image for existing and future viewers. In the past I didn't think the image of the work mattered so much, but now I realize that casual attitude cannot hold up in the future as we grow. It needs to feel more professional.
</p>

<p>
	I think I can tone it down without losing the directness, honesty, and in-your-faceness. I want to be direct without being offensive or obnoxious, which I sometimes come off as. It will take me some practice to find the right balance. It should be subtle.

<p>
	So, after considering the situation, I've decided to retract my dating post because I see people getting resentful and this undermines the focus of my teachings, which is more important to me than dating. People will try to use this to demonize my teachings in the future, which I don't want to have to deal with as I get enough of that already.
</p>

<p>
	For those who supported me, thanks and I appreciate your support. But I have to learn to be more careful with image issues and political correctness going forward because the pressures will become great to demonize my teachings as Actualized.org grows in size and naturally develops more enemies who will misconstrue everything I say in order to invalidate the work. This is something I have to think about more seriously going forward because really these teachings should be as little about me as possible. Ideally I want to take my personal self out of the teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry, my mistake. Party's over folks.
</p>

<p>
	In the future I will be making further changes to my style and manner of delivery in order to make the teachings more selfless and tactful. The days where Actualized.org could be the wild west are coming to an end. As the size grows, image issues become more serious and important. This seems to be the nature of politics and public relations that I don't have much experience with. I am still learning to navigate these waters because my natural style is blunt and politically incorrect. I notice that I have to be much more careful and responsible as more people watch my content in ways that were not normal for me in the early days. I am looking forward to cleaning up my presentation so that it is more selfless and then you don't have worry so much about your friends saying that you are following a cult leader. Although of course that will be said no matter what due to the nature of the material we study.
</p>

<p>
	I apologize for not being more forward-thinking about these issues.
</p>

<p>
	One of the things I also plan to do in the future is clean up my language and stop dropping f-bombs. I've been thinking of doing that for some time now, and this situation will hasten that. I have been seeing for a while now that these changes will be necessary for what Actualized.org is to become in the future. My style needs to mature to reflect the gravity of the work. I will also hold myself to a higher standard as a role-model, because even though I don't particularly want to be one, people will treat me like one regardless and it is my responsibility to take that one as part of delivering these teachings. It just comes with the job.
</p>

	You don't know shit, son.
</p>

<p>
	Listen to the wisdom of a 1000 rejections.
</p>

<p>
	Forget about love for a month. This is not the place for it. Attraction is what you have for her. You are desperate to be with her.
</p>

<p>
	Doesn't matter if she approached you. You need to cool down by 1000%. If it's true she approached you, then you can play it real cool and easy. Keep your texts short and lite. No walls of text. Nothing serious. Use texts to set up an evening coffee date. Keep all texts short and playful.

	Of course you can self-actualize and learn a lot, but at some point you will probably outgrow that job and want to find something more refined.

<p>
	For the love of God, stop treating this girl like a princess. Do not try anything deep or spiritual.

<p>
	Text her: "Hey dork"

<p>
	NO SPECIAL CONNECTION! NO LOVE!
</p>

<p>
	You are needy as fuck and she will instantly reject you.
</p>

<p>
	You need to play it cool, like you don't care about her at all. You must be the prize, not her. As soon as she feels that you think she is the prize, you will lose her.

<p>
	Look, take it easy. Deconstructing reality is the most challenging work in the universe. Sometimes you gotta take a short break and just enjoy life. Then get back to deconstructing. If you want. Don't do this work if you don't love it at some level.

<p>
	I have no idea since I'm no corporate climbing woman.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly there will be challenges there. You are dealing with stage Orange men who will be very masculine in their attitude and probably will not take you seriously unless you kick some ass and grab some balls.
</p>

<p>
	You should seek out a woman in corporate for better advice.

<p>
	Let's say she was just being nice, then she rejected me for my looks, which is even worse.
</p>

<p>
	But in that specific case, she literally looked at me, took my necklace in her hand, and said, "Ewww... I don't like this. Go away."
</p>

<p>
	And I've had girls not return my texts even after we slept together. Fucking cold.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Welcome to reality.
</p>

<p>
	You know, it's not like us men sat down and decided one day: we will be attracted to X but not Y. Attraction is not a choice.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: why aren't you attracted to a gorilla? When you get to the bottom of that one, you may understand why not everyone is attracted to you.
</p>

<p>
	No one likes being rejected for any aspect of themselves, flesh or otherwise. Rejection always hurts. And women reject men all the time over the most superficial things. I've had women reject me because of the necklace I wore. I've had women punch me in the mouth and I couldn't hit her back.
</p>

<p>
	That's life. You suck it up.
</p>

<p>
	I have literally been rejected 1000s of times. Some nights I'd go home and cry. It's good for the ego. Makes you stronger. Teaches you not to care what people think.
</p>

<p>
	I am suggesting dating is a survival game and honesty was never its goal.
</p>

<p>
	I like being honest about what dating is. So as not to fool ourselves with stories about it.

<p>
	None of this means you can't have a decent relationship. Just understand that both sides are playing games. And that's okay. Life is an interplay and life is sneaky.

<p>
	Pickup works of course, but:
</p>

<p>
	A) I don't really enjoy clubs and bars. I did that earlier in my life because it forced me to grow. I would rather be meditating. Chasing girls is not so appealing to me since my time is valuable. I am not a social person by temperment. I can be happy living in a cave. And one day I may just completely leave society behind and you may never hear from me again.

	There is an order of operations to dating. Don't go too deep too fast. But eventually you can go deep. You have to calibrate.

<p>
	It depends a lot on the level of development of the people you commune with. If they are low in development, stage Red or Orange, they will preceive nice as too weak to survive.
</p>

<p>
	Nice gets appreciated and valued at stage Green and above.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you try to be nice in prison, it will backfire.

	YES! Very good. Now that's some progress. You are an enneagram type 2. Classic girly problem.

You gotta be very clever and intelligent about it. You gotta be like a fox.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that all of reality runs on cleverness. Brute force approaches are not smart enough to solve the deep problems.
</p>

<p>
	The problem you're facing is a lack of requisite variety (a cybernetics term). See my blog post video on Requisite Variety. It will explain everything.

	I don't plan it. I just do it when it feels right.

<p>
	It takes me 1hr 20mins to make a lap around the entire city on the circular highway. I just drive and think or meditate. Driving puts me in flow. Best part of my day.

	What I do is I take hour-long drives to nowhere late at night and just contemplate/integrate whatever ideas are in my mind that day while I drive. Not so good for global warning, but amazing for my clarity of mind.

			Especially while you're pretending to teach conscious dating and relationships among the things you teach.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You realize that what I posted is actually conscious and honest? I posted my dating intentions honestly without any games.
</p>

<p>
	Any other alternative will be more dishonest and manipulative. The problem is that people are so used to playing games with dating that when someone does it directly and honestly they are shocked.
</p>

<p>
	Usually all dating is done in secret so that none of your people know your true intentions. This is safe for the ego and lets you get away with a lot more manipulation.
</p>

<p>
	With dating and sexuality in particular, people are often outraged and shocked when the mechanics of the game are laid bare before their eyes. As if the mechanics were not present before looking.
</p>

<p>
	Hiding your intentions does not make your dating any more conscious or honest. And really, dating is never a function of honesty. It is dishonest to suggest that dating is honest. That is not its function. It's an illusion and a game that both sides are playing while trying to pretend like that isn't so.
</p>

<p>
	You can cry about how unfair it all is, but the reality is, when you acquire your dates -- however you acquire them, online or offline -- you are still playing this game.
</p>

<p>
	If I truly wanted to be dishonest and manipulative, I could easily have done that a long time ago and gotten laid a 100x over. My position can basically get me unlimited sex for a lifetime. I could push that button any time. And I basically never do because I have some integrity. But that doesn't mean I'm disinterested in finding a romantic partner. I am. That's honest. And that's okay.
</p>

<p>
	You can judge it of course. But if you really care about honesty so much, I invite you to contemplate the double-standard of how you acquire your dates. You may find that your method is less honest than mine. Consider all the social circle games you play.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Dude, when you date, you don't get all philosophical about it. You keep things fun and easy. Don't start whipping out actualized.org lectures on your date. You relate on a much shallower level.
</p>

<p>
	On your profile you could mention that you're into spirituality and meditation. That should pique some girls' interests. The smart girls. Girls love spirituality stuff. It's like chick-crack.
</p>

<p>
	If I'm socializing with a girl, I act like a total goofball. It's not serious. Stop saying anything logical. This is the #1 rule of game. No logic.

<p>
	Your logic is backwards.
</p>

<p>
	The risks of mutation are higher when we don't get vaccinated. Letting a virus just run loose through the population will result in more mutations and even more dangerous strains.

If what you want is a honest guy, screen him for it early on.
</p>

<p>
	Honesty is a character trait. Some people have it, some don't. Train yourself to be a good judge of character.

</p>

<p>
	You'd be surprised. You can meet conscious and openminded people in clubs and bars. Girls of all kinds go to clubs and bars for fun with their friends. There is this false idea that only sluts or skanks go to clubs. That's not true. I've met some amazing people. One of the most amazing things you'll discover when you go out a lot is that you will bump into the most surprising people. I once bumped into Tony Robbin's copywriter and she went on a date with me. We had some amazing conversations and she was all into self-help and stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically, it is closedminded to believe that openminded people don't go to clubs.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, I've never really enjoyed clubbing. It's something I did to grow myself, but it's not an environment I want to be in if I can avoid it.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, I once met a stripper with a Om tattoo and she liked to smoke DMT and was into yoga. People are more interesting and complex than you expect.
</p>

<p>
	As far as finding a high caliber match, that's basically luck. The more numbers you get the better your chances. You can't really predict it.
</p>

That's called business. Maybe you should question why you expect him to give you shit for free.
</p>

<p>
	Wherever your paycheck comes from, you do the same thing. You sell something for profit so that you could feed yourself. And you better understand that enlightened gurus are not above selling you shit. Because survival requires money.

</p>

<p>
	The whole point of a Buddha is that he don't give a fuck if he dies tomorrow because his enlightenment already killed him.
</p>

<p>
	Why would survival be automatically taken care of? What fantasy world are you living in? If the Buddha does not brush his teeth, his teeth will fall out.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to escape survival is to stop caring about it. But that does not at all guarantee you will survive. But luckily if you did part 1, you no longer care about part 2.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is radical stuff.

<p>
	But, sure, you can find decent men. They exist.
</p>

<p>
	But you have to understand that your criteria for men is asymmetrical. A man is not subject to the same survival pressures as a woman, so don't expect men to be as nice as women. If they were, they would get steamrolled by other men.

If it wasn't, it would have already been done, and there would be no value in doing it.
</p>

<p>
	Improving society is always H-A-R-D for this reason. This is why society evolves inch by inch, tooth by tooth, claw by claw.

<p>
	Depends on how you're defining "nice". If by nice you mean a meek door-mat with low self-esteem who can't stand up for herself, then yeah, people will have less respect for you because you let them push you around. People tend to be exploitative. If they see an opportunity to exploit you and you just let them get away with it, then they will usually do it. It's just how humans are wired for survival's sake.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to set boundaries and not be afraid to enforce them. Once people see you enforcing your boundaries they will stop trying to exploit you because they know you're not the kind of person who stomachs their BS.
</p>

<p>
	That's a tall order to fill. Not just for a man, but for any human.
</p>

<p>
	What you're asking for is a highly developed, conscious, selfless man. Which is gonna be as rare as a highly developed, conscious, selfless woman. Basically, you want to be date God <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	See... on the one hand you want a man who not manipulative, yet on the other hand you want a man who's really good at survival and a provider. These two things are inversely related. A "strong" man is often the most manipulative and deceptive. That's how he gets his strength in a low-consciousness society. And a weak man is probably not gonna make you wet. So it's a delicate balancing act.
</p>

<p>
	And here's the ultimate kicker: if you ever sleep with a man who's that God-like, and if you ever break up with him, it will be the most painful, heartbreaking event of your life. Because you know you'll probably never meet someone that good again. So be careful what you wish for. Just because a man is good or Godly does not guarantee he will not break up with you at some point for any number of legit reasons which have nothing to do with him cheating or being an asshole.
</p>

<p>
	There is a deeper problem you're hitting up against here, which is this: every great thing comes to an end, and the greater the thing is, the sadder its end will be. You can't escape this. This is the existential suffering that the Buddha taught. Relationships are bound to be painful. There is no such thing as a perfect relationship without any pain. Relationships are like a rollercoaster, so enjoy the thrill while it lasts.
</p>

<p>
	The better the man, the bigger the problem.
</p>

<p>
	Any kind of attachment will necessarily create suffering. Such is life.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, that's called Primordial Avoidance.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is terrified of realizing it's own emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	The thing looking through your eyes is Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	You are Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	How can you continue? As you slowly chip away at it, you'll get more comfortable looking inward and eventually the resistance will melt away with only Infinity remaining. This chipping away process can take a few years. Gently keep at it. If it gets too emotionally tough, take a brief break and then return to it a few days later.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, Self-Love is key here. Don't force yourself too much. Comfort yourself with Self-Love when the going gets tough.

<p>
	Brand new categories of thing usually flop business-wise because they are too unorthodox, no one sees the value of them, and the first few editions of it are too unpolished for mass-market success.
</p>

<p>
	Which is exactly what happened with the early tablets and mp3 players.
</p>

<p>
	Polishing a turd is what Apple does well.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to us humans. The first humanoid creatures were not so great. It took many iterations for evolution to finally arrive at homo sapiens and then we took over the whole world.

But innovation is important.
</p>

<p>
	You're confusing innovation with "creating a brand new thing". But most innovation is minor and evolutionary.

Everywhere you look things could be better designed, improved, or made more efficient. Survival problems lurk everywhere. All you have to do is find one good solution to a survival problem and you're in business.
</p>

<p>
	You need to develop the mind of an entrepreneur who is constantly looking at how the world can be improved.
</p>

<p>
	Every time I buy a product I look at it and see ways it could have been made better. When you start looking at the world like this you will soon have more business ideas than years left in your life.
</p>

<p>
	Just an example to inspire you:
</p>

<p>
	One time I was eating a rotisserie chicken. I noticed how its crispy wings were the tastiest part. They were perfectly crunchy, unlike any chicken wings I've had before. I wanted more! So I wondered, why doesn't somebody just sell rotisserie chicken wings? They'd be a huge hit! So I got the idea of starting a chicken wings fast-food chain that only sells crispy rotisserie chicken wings and various dipping sauces. Then I started researching how to launch a fast food restaurant. I even bought a couple of books on it.
</p>

<p>
	That was like 8 years ago. But it was an idea outside my zone of genius so I let it go. To this day I feel that if someone started a simple rotisserie chicken wing fast food chain it would become the next Chipotle. You would make a billion dollars with that one idea.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If you make a billion dollars with this idea, please send me a check for 10% <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	Sounds like your technique is very noob.
</p>

<p>
	Having the best profile pics is EVERYTHING in online dating. You must hire a professional photographer to take your pics, not some selfie bullshit. Pay a pro $500. Get really good casual pics of yourself. And you need some pics of you being social, not just a loner.
</p>

<p>
	And yes, you text game sounds like it sucks too. Takes lots of practice to get it just right.
</p>

<p>
	Key practicing. These things require lots of failure before success.

<p>
	That's one strategy. But don't be surprised if that isn't enough. You may not be able to make your product so innovative. That innovation can cost more than advertizing. And I'm not necessarily saying advertizing is the solution. Marketing is a much bigger thing than running ads.

</p>

<p>
	Then you can get to work building that future.
</p>

<p>
	Loneliness is not a hard problem to solve. You just need to make some lifestyle changes so that you're meeting new people.

Look, the most important thing to do when you're in this kind of funk is to take back control of your mind. Your mind is spinning all those of negative stories about the future which is making you feel hopeless. You must take back control of your mind by every day visualizing yourself in a good place in the future. You may be going through some bad life conditions right now, but always you must keep a hopeful and exciting vision of the future. This has to be done proactively, not passively. Every day, spend at least 20 minutes sitting on the couch visualizing a great life for yourself regardless of how you feel or what your limiting belief. This is your medicine. Start doing it.
</p>

<p>
	When your mind starts imagining negative shit, you must stop it and start imaging positive stuff.
</p>

	That's a deep topic.

<p>
	If you're serious, you should spend the next 5 years contemplating and studying all the points I made in the videos. This is not something you just follow a list of bullet points on. You must think profoundly about these epistemic issues as you go about learning and doing science.
</p>

<p>
	No one is gonna hold your hand towards groundbreaking, genius-level science. That's your job to figure out and then convince the world of your discoveries. People will not like your discoveries.

<p>
	That's not going to work. That's far too lazy of a strategy. That strategy is basically hoping for breadcrumbs. You need a way to actively and reliably bring in new clients.

<p>
	Of course followers are necessary, and that's not a problem because most people are happy being sheep.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why most people are wage slaves and tolerate being so -- they are not strong enough to lead themselves or others. Of course there are also systemic inequality problems which are inherent to capitalism.

<p>
	"Wage slavery" is actually a technical term from Marxism.
</p>

<p>
	But I use the term rather loosely. To me it's any job where you don't have much creative autonomy and your paycheck is capped by your boss rather than your creative output.
</p>

<p>
	The point of wage slavery in Marxism is that your boss is not giving you the full value of your work. You don't get to own the work you produce.
</p>

<p>
	See, with Actualized.org, all the work I do I own. Not so with a wage slave job. If I was creating these videos for some boss, he would own all my work and he would reap all the profits while I would get pennies.

<p>
	It is a genuine fear. Don't try to avoid it, just bask in it and appreciate the gravity of the situation. You're still very young and you have many options, so don't feel bad. Escaping wage slavery is a serious long-term project. You must approach it with patience and careful strategy.
</p>

<p>
	Also, it's not gonna kill ya to work a bit in the wage market just to get a feel for how things work. There are lessons to be learned there. Good jobs do exist. If you get a job within your field of passion, then it's not so bad. And this in fact might be necessary for you to build a decent experience base before venturing off on your own. It's hard to survive on your own. You gotta really know what you're doing. This usually takes years of experience and skill.

	Your biggest issue is gonna be figuring out how to market your services and attract paying clients.
</p>

<p>
	If you've never run a biz before it can be extra challenging to market spirituality. It's much easier to market more material things.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	That's the whole point! Nothing is stopping your mind from inventing whatever stories and excuses convenient to it.
</p>

<p>
	But haven't you noticed? That is exactly what you are doing every day of your life right now!
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of Goodness is that it is uncoerced. Nothing stops a good person from killing another person and rationalizing it away. So when he chooses not to do that, that is what makes him good. If he was forced to be good, goodness would be worthless.
</p>

<p>
	What you fail to appreciate is that rationality is precisely the function of the mind which is used to justify every evil ever committed by man. Rationality does not and cannot lead to Goodness. Rationality is whore to the devil.

	You can increase consciousness, but there are limits defined by your attachment to this life and human form.
</p>

<p>
	You can't be a human and glide like a flying squirrel.

<title>Is Self-Love still the &quot;solution&quot; even for those who lack fulfillment of basic needs?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/57192-is-self-love-still-the-solution-even-for-those-who-lack-fulfillment-of-basic-needs/?do=findComment&amp;comment=767488</link>

<p>
	Self-Love is a grand thing, it includes within it all material needs too.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a material problem, like a broken leg, you must solve it at the material level, by getting a cast. And that IS Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	It is a mistake to try to solve all material problems at the spiritual level. If your child is hungry, give him food. And that is Love.
</p>

<title>Observations on Love vs love</title>

<p>
	Yeah, that's life in a nutshell. On the one hand you want to be selfless, on the other hand you cannot because it would kill you. So you're stuck somewhere in the middle.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing capable of truly unconditional Love is Infinite Consciousness. Anything less will be a lesser manifestation of love. Form and finitude itself limits Love.

	Yes, of course. But also, don't use this as a ego-trick to stop your spiritual work. Customize the work and the path to yourself. But you can still use teachers and teachings to guide you. Just don't get too attached to the teachings. And yes, honor your own intuitions.

<p>
	Taking it once per day or in large doses will not create detoxification, it will merely redistribute toxins deeper into your organs and brain. It's the opposite of detox.
</p>

<p>
	To detox with ALA requires taking it every 3 hours for 3 days straight, including at night while you sleep.

	All of neoliberalism and the economic platform of the corporate capitalist DNC.
</p>

<p>
	Capitalism needs serious reforms and structural changes, not just tinkering around edges as Biden plans to do.
</p>

<p>
	We don't necessarily have to go full-socialist, but capitalism needs serious systemic reforms. Right now Neolibs are in denial about the structural problems of capitalism. They pretend as though no structural problems exist. This is a stage Orange disaster.

	ALA is not a supplement you should ever take unless you are doing a strict detox protocol. ALA will shift heavy metals around in your body and make things worse if you take it as a supplement.

<p>
	Green likes to go too far on social and cultural issues. Orange likes to not go far enough on economic issues.

	Don't forget, Bill Maher is a Boomer. You can't expect too much from him. He's not gonna be a foaming at the mouth socialist. For a Boomer he's doing all right.

	Every decision in life comes with risks.

<p>
	Strategy is about making wise decisions with imperfect knowledge and no guarantees of success.

<p>
	You are exhibiting poor strategy, which could end up killing millions of people. Which is why people like you should not occupy positions of power and responsibility.

<p>
	But it's not the same compound. It's not the same purity. And there are many more synthetic chems than anything natural.
</p>

<p>
	All this makes synthetics better. They are more precise, clean, and potent.

</p>

<p>
	The rest is just execution. Start reading books and researching online for courses, programs, trainings, seminars, etc. You will figure it out. You've got plenty of time. You don't need to have all the answers given to you right now. You will figure out all the technical details along the way. What's most important is that you have a clear direction in mind and that you chip away at it every day for months and years.
</p>

<p>
	Spend a couple of years just doing a bunch of online research about business and entrepreneurship. Sign up to some business magazines and slowly, every month you will get new ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get me wrong, your life can become a lot better if you are stuck in depression. You don't have to keep being depressed forever.

<p>
	Many severe negative emotional states you can learn to outgrow and just drop. In this way your life will feel much better.

	This is downright stupid. You should not be doing research chems at all with this attitude.
</p>

<p>
	You must test everything carefully and slowly. Like your life depends on it. Because it does.

<p>
	I wouldn't hope on life getting easier. If you are growing properly, life will always present you with greater and greater challenges.
</p>

<p>
	Life becomes less dysfunctional though, and less about raw survival and the associated negative emotions.
</p>

<p>
	If you become financially independent and secure thanks to your LP, that does take a huge survival load off your shoulders. But life can still be hard. 2020 was one of the hardest years of my life thanks to unforeseen health problems. No amount of success or money or even spiritual work will save you when you have the right kind of health problem.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking though, life is a hamster running endlessly in a wheel until it dies of exhaustion. You are the hamster, and no matter how much success you achieve you ultimately get nowhere. Because there's nowhere else to be. This is one of the biggest things spirituality teaches you. Be. Here. Now. This. Is. It.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't be happy now, you never will be.
</p>

<p>
	If we don't the global economy will be dead for a decade to come.
</p>

<p>
	Vaccine is the only thing that will save the economy at this point.
</p>

<p>
	You can cry all you want about the dangers of vaccines, but consider the dangers of a 10-year global Great Depression with 30% unemployment and 50% of businesses closed forever.
</p>

<p>
	The choice is yours. Choose wisely.

	There is nothing wrong with shitting where you eat.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is when you shit where you eat and then you complain about the taste.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing judgmental or egotistical about pointing out that mankind tends to shit where it eats and then loves to cry about it as though some great evil was cast upon mankind by God.

<p>
	Don't shit where you eat and then you won't need to cry or blame God.

<p>
	No other way, brother. This game involves some risk. If you can't handle the fire, get out of the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
	If it is 5-MeO-MIPT or 5-MeO-DALT or something similar in the 5-MeO category, you will generally have a profound experience and it will not harm you.
</p>

<p>
	The only real danger with research chems is if they send you something totally not a tryptamine. And usually the only reason that would happen is if they make a serious mistake in labeling. No tryptamine is gonna kill ya. Worst you'll get is a bad trip.
</p>

<p>
	I would stay away from 5-MeO-DPT though, it's a nasty one.

<p>
	Usually rectal psychedelics are faster and more potent than oral.
</p>

<p>
	The potency of psychedelic administration routes is like this:

<p>
	IV > vape/smoke > snort > rectal > oral

		<p>
			So, what are your thoughts and do you have any advises for me?

<p>
	Your problem is not what you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with serious personal development is that you must resolve problems at new levels of consciousness, not within the same old paradigms.
</p>

<p>
	Here's your real problem: you've selected a zero-sum career. Your success essentially requires stealing money from others and having them lose money. Your career entirely hinges on competition, so of course you will be fearful of being out-competed because that's exactly what happens in a competition paradigm. There is always someone better than you who will eat your lunch. Always. You're playing a game you can't really win, and that's not satisfying. And naturally it comes with fear of being beaten. Because you will be.
</p>

<p>
	The solution here is radical: change your entire entire paradigm to non-zero-sum. Make your career about creativity and value-generation rather than leeching value from other humans. This way you will have little to fear because your success will only be limited by personal creative effort and energy.
</p>

<p>
	I've done business in the zero-sum competitive paradigm before and it sucks compared to the non-zero-sum creative paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Do you see what I mean about solving problems at new levels of consciousness? The problem is always deeper and more meta than you first imagine.
</p>

<p>
	You are lucky to have the success you'd had thus far. I would save up money and plan a transition to a truly creative and value-offering career. Not just a career but a life purpose. You have no idea how much of your creative potential and intelligence you are wasting on leeching money from other humans. You could be doing so much more with your life. But of course, you're afraid to move on. << That's where the true fear of failure and success arises. Not in playing poker better, but in moving on to something truly creative beyond poker. Something that will demand much more of your heart and soul.
</p>

<p>
	When you die, on your tombstone do you want it to be written: "This guy spent his whole life clicking on an LCD screen to leech money from others because he was too sacred to do something truly creative and profound with his life."
</p>

<p>
	One of the core Buddhist precepts is "right livelihood".
</p>

<p>
	Using meditation and yoga to leech money from others is a perversion of these holy practices.
</p>

<p>
	Think about it.
</p>

<p>
	If you're serious about growing in this area, take my Life Purpose Course which explains all this and much more in great detail.
</p>

<p>
	That will reveal their lack of understanding of Spiral Dynamics. So let's see the quality of what people post. If people are mostly posting unhealthy toxic cartoonish stuff, then they're failing the test.
