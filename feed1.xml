<p>
	Technical minutia is something the ego-mind cares about. There are much bigger fish to fry.

<p>
	Relative to an oil or banking executive Musk is doing great.
</p>

<p>
	We can't really expect him to be a guru. As a big business guy he's about as conscious as they get.
</p>

<p>
	But of course nowhere close to enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Be probabaly just did some LSD.

<p>
	Of course many business people are seduced by Silicon Valley and Wall Street culture.
</p>

<p>
	The center of gravity of the culture you hang out in will either pull you up or drag you down, depending on how high your aim is.

<title>Spiral dynamics; Mastering a stage vs. Getting stuck in a stage</title>

<p>
	Teachings are more healthy when they don't demonize other stages, especially the higher stages which most peoole have yet to reach.
</p>

<p>
	So, for example, to be vocal about the dangers of stage Green right now is problematic because most people are still clinging to stage Blue and Orange. People need to be show the value and beauty of Green. People need to be lead to Green and beyond.
</p>

<p>
	Healthy teachings are those which lead folks to higher stages without demonizing other stages.
</p>

			I had multiple insights and experiences that every creation and every moment of this eternity is made from love for love, from me for me just expressed in different ways, but in the end I always feel like I want to run from myself. Like I'm dying instead of living. I know that all answers are within me, I ask God what I want to know and he provides me the answer the moment I finish my question. I have been working on transforming that fear to love for 3 or 4 years now, and I am in the place the same as when I started. I stopped meditating long time ago because it get too intense physical. I'm surrendering always to everything but the fear is so rooted in me. I can't express myself through conversation or any day to day experience.,.I can only feel alive when I take a high dose of shrooms or 4aco dmt when I die mentally, when I surrender to death. Those are the only times I feel love and peace with myself. If you have any advice for me, i would be thankful.

<p>
	More, deeper awakenings are required and some serious, industrial-grade spiritual practices like meditation/yoga/concentration.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will not rewire decades of bad mind habits. That requires daily practices over years.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional mastery is the hardest part of this work. It's much harder than a few awakenings and psychedelics alone will not be enough for that.

<title>Overwhelmed with Bliss</title>

<p>
	Observe yourself chasing positive states and notice how this subtle duality and attachment creates suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Expecting constant bliss precludes true peacefulness since when your bliss dips you start to complain, "Where did my bliss go? How can I get it back?" Which is the very root of unhappiness: trying to escape the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to chase bliss. Just observe this dynamic closely so that you become more and more aware that it cannot ultimately work. Through lots of observation of this clinging you will slowly aikido your clinging into surrender.
</p>

<p>
	If you have no memory of it, then that's the problem. You either did too much or you just weren't conscious enough to retain anything.
</p>

<p>
	This is one of the problems with smoking it. It's too fast, without giving you time to contemplate and understand what is actually happening to you. Contemplation is key here.
</p>

<p>
	This is why plugging it is much better for our work.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of psychedelics is to make sense of how your consciousness changes. Not just to have an experience but to UNDERSTAND why this experience is happening and what it is that is happening.
</p>

<p>
	Next time lower your doses and contemplate what reality is. You're looking for insight.
</p>

			Brother quick question, this confuses me huge times. I really love your insights and curiously follow them and use them to realize the same  it helped alot. But at some points I find it confusing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Is this new insight not something that goes against all previous ones? 
		</p>

		<p>
			Ill list them here
		</p>

		<p>
			1.No free will/No control: We (humans) have no control whatsoever even if raising our finger or deciding to become lazy and lie on the couch forever (which I saw in your free will and live enlightenment video) that nothing is in the humans control. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Even Ramana Maharshi said everything even the finger raising is already predetermined, which brings to the second point. - >
		</p>

		<p>
			2.infinite intelligence: god is infinitely intelligent, comparing him to a game designer or a country in which neither the designer nor the goverment know what the citizens or the players will do because they are not infinitely intelligent and cannot foresee any unfolding, in contrast infinite intelligence knows everything and is everything so how can it be suprised by itself?  Wouldnt this mean that God needs to think and become sceptic in his decision and doesnt create instantly and superconsciously with infinite intelligence? 
		</p>

		<p>
			3. Twoness/Duality: saying that the government doesnt know what the citizens do, or the gamedesigner doesnt know how the players play. Or the legocreator that wont know what the child builds of it all imply one and other/twoness/separation. 
		</p>

		<p>
			However god and the humans are not separate so he should definitely know what will happen, if saying there is any kind of human independence creation isn't that just saying that there is one tiny little thing remaining that Is separate from God and not in gods control? 
		</p>

		<p>
			One more timeThank you <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="1" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/" rel="">@Leo Gura</a> for being available always I learned alot through your webpage.

<p>
	It ain't HPPD when you're in the middle of a high! LOL
</p>

<p>
	What happened was that you saw how your mind constructs/imagines reality. Yeah, you're in a hallucination at all times. The only question is how solid or loose is that hallucination. When you're sober your mind is very rigid and locked in. When you're high your mind is loose and free to imagine new physical realities.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing surprising about this.

You are assessing the existential reality of a thing based on monetary value. And yet it's obvious that money is purely a human imaginary construction.
</p>

<p>
	Take this work seriously or don't even bother.
</p>

<p>
	You're not even trying to question reality.

<p>
	Many awakening experiences required.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a great deal.
</p>

<p>
	So does Kirya Yoga.
</p>

<p>
	You are going to think you way out of your body. This requires radical changes in your state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you do 100 psychedelic trips you will become much more detached from your body overall.
</p>

<p>

<title>Can i live a Happy &amp; Content Life Without Sex?</title>

<p>
	Even advanced spiritual masters struggle with taming their sex drive. So for an average person it is basically impossible. You may as well stop shitting while you're at it.
</p>

<p>
	If you become a hardcore yogi, it is possible to transcend. But none of you here are at that level and I would never trust you to do it.
</p>

<p>
	You are better off being honest about your sexual cravings rather than trying to act all noble when deep down we both know you are a horny dog who cannot control itself in the slightest.
</p>

<p>
	If you were presented with an opportunity for sex you would pounce on it like a starving lion on a gazelle.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse lack of opportunity for some kind of spiritual transcendence. Just because you got no one to screw doesn't make you advanced. Actually it means you are even less advanced than you think. It makes you a starved devil.
</p>

<p>
	It is funny when a devil pretends to be above sex. You ain't fooling anyone but yourself.
</p>

<title>Trip Report - Challenging Psychedelic Experience</title>

Sounds like a typical trip. You doubt yourself too much.
</p>

<p>
	Drop your expectations for pleasantness or divinity. The trip gives you what you need. Integrate it and conintue tripping. Future trips will be different.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I find 4-AcO-DMT to be a huge mindfuck. Other psychedelics are easier.
</p>

<p>
	For me, the whole point of tripping is to contemplate and get answers. What answers do you want?
</p>

<p>
	It seems you're looking for a good time but you are not serious about understanding what reality is. When you get serious about understanding, how you feel will become irrelevant. This is why a passion for truth is so important in this work, otherwise you start chasing good feelings and you think something is wrong when you don't get good feeling. But notice, good feelings are a selfish motivation.
</p>

<p>
	You must get very clear about what you want out of this work.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Answering people's questions is often counter-productive because people are usually asking the wrong questions, and giving them answers does not actually help them become more conscious.
</p>

<p>
	A good guru goes meta and shows you the limitations of your questioning process. A good guru gets you to see that asking him for answers will not work. A good guru shows you how to find the answers from within.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that people's questions usually come from a place of survival, which only deepens their problem. A guru must show you how and why to go beyond survival.

<p>
	You have to be careful with such assumptions. These chemicals work differently on different people.
</p>

<p>
	Just because it works like this for me doesn't mean it will work this way for you or others.
</p>

<p>
	I can only report how it works for me. And in my experience, how such chemicals work on me is pretty unique. So you can't automatically extrapolate it to others. One's foundation, intentions, personality type, and genetics matter very much.
</p>

<p>
	Also, oracle implies that you are make predictions about things. I did not do that, nor would I consider that appropriate. It could be very dangerous to start playing the role of some oracle, getting people to believe you know the future, etc. Such powers are easily abused and could cause lots of harm.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between describing the nature of reality vs making predictions about the future. I would never make predictions about another person's life as this would interfere with their self-discovery process.
</p>

<p>
	It's also potentially quite dangerous to get it into your head that you speak for God. It's easy to corrupt God's messages and deceive yourself and others. I have to be very careful about it. And I don't really claim to speak for God. My claims are more modest: I understand what God is.

<p>
	What you should notice about conspiracy theorists in general is that they have low quality minds and are emotionally immature.
</p>

<p>
	It's an attractive distraction from deep inner work.
</p>

<p>
	And the fact that once in a blue moon a conspiracy theory gets a bit of validation only makes conspiracy theorists all the more dangerous. If conspiracy theories were 100% false all the time, they would not be nearly as dangerous as when they are 90% false. The devil always needs to sprinkle in a few nuggets of truth into his teachings in order to get people bought in. A devil never sells you outright falsehood. The devil rarely outright lies. Because it's ineffective. The devil prefers to twist and pervert the truth. That's far more effective and malicious.
</p>

<p>
	The greatest delusions are built upon kernels of truth. There needs to be just enough truth so that the mind can rationalize away all the obvious falsehood.
</p>

<p>
	Alex Jones is a textbook example of this.
</p>

<p>
	You know what the greatest falsehood is today? Science!
</p>

<p>
	Precisely because it's so accurate at making predictions. Nobody suspects that the entirety of science could be a house of cards. Science is one of the devil's greatest works of deception.
</p>

	I highly doubt it's Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Those are not diverse books. Looks like they are all part of the same incestuous family.

<p>
	I don't consider Gnositics to be that deeply woke. They are still playing at the shallow end of the nondual pool.

	It's no different than the way a country or a corporation works.
</p>

<p>
	A country is made out of its citizens. It controls and limits its citizens yet you are still free on any given day to decide what to eat, where to drive, and so forth. The limits are merely bounds to a sandbox. What you do in the sandbox is largely up to you.
</p>

<p>
	Or think of it this way: when you play with Legos, there are fundamental limits to what you can build given the shape of the blocks. But you still have enormous freedom to build lots of unique stuff which the designers of the blocks could not have envisioned.
</p>

<p>
	All limits work this way. Nothing is absolutely set in stone. Even if you're locked in a jail cell, you still have some freedom. You can still decide when to shit.

<p>
	No, that is to say that limits are finite. Knowledge is a limited thing, which you are failing to acknowledge. Knowledge is not unlimited because it must always take a certain form. Everything that takes on a form must become limited. This is simply a tautology. God cannot fully "know" itself because God is too infinite to be captured in a finite box (which is what knowledge is).
</p>

<p>
	So all we're saying is that God cannot put itself in a box. Or when it goes, it is no longer fully God, it is a part of God.

<p>
	You are thinking about this in far too limited a manner. You're using dualistic logic to try to figure this out, and that will never work.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a fixed story like a movie. It is an interactive story which is always in the process of being written, like a video game. The designers of a video game set very tight constraints, yet you as the player are still given a lot of freedom, so much so that even the designers cannot predict what you will do next.
</p>

<p>
	Even humans are capable enough of creating a video game which gives players agency, yet you think God is such a fool that all he could do was sit down and write out your entire life story?
</p>

<p>
	It's way more subtle and intelligent than that. Stop taking God for a moron.

</p>

<p>
	To understand the validity of a mathematical proof requires insight. Exactly the same kind of insight as enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you apply insight in the relative domain does not mean it is different in the absolute domain. Insight is a general function of consciousness. It can be used in all sorts of ways, from the mundane to the divine.
</p>

<p>
	You can have a valid insight into how to boil an egg. Of course that insight is relative to you being a human in a physical world where there exist eggs. If you enter some 5 dimensional astral realm, boiling eggs may no longer work.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Red & Blue spirituality is dogmatic and authoritarian.
</p>

<p>
	You need to seriously take into account historical context. The notion of being non-dogmatic did not even exist 1500 years ago in Arabia.
</p>

<p>
	And my guess is that Muhammad himself was not deeply enlightened. Rather he was good at channeling.
</p>

<p>
	And then of course you have to distinguish between Muhammad himself and his followers. Even if Muhammad was the shit, most of the people following him were dogmatic and they corrupted his teachings.
</p>

<p>
	It's not different than Christianity and all other religions.

<p>
	The problem is one of doubt. Unless you have direct consciousness of God you will doubt it because it's too amazing to believe.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you did believe it, it wouldn't help much because it is not part of your living experience. It'd just a story some guy told you.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between being told about orgasm and actually having one.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is solved the moment you experience yourself as God. Awakening is the solution.

<p>
	You fear profile is gonna depend on an infinitely long chain of causation like your genetics, your personality type, the environment you were raised in, stuff that happened to you, thoughts you think, your goals and desires, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Remember fear is a survival mechanic. It was necessary to keep you alive as your limited human self. Fear is the cost of staying alive as a finite being. So in this sense it's hard to avoid. This is the whole challange of becoming infinite.

<p>
	Quantum and chemicals are forms within consciousness. You cannot ever get underneath consciousness because it is the only thing there is.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the TV screen. Everything else is content displayed on the screen. Don't confuse content for the screen itself.

<p>
	There was no strain at all (except for the writing hand). It was comfortable and enjoyable.

	There is little ego backlash these days. It's no big deal at this point. As the mind becomes more pure there are less and less problems over all and the trips are always positive and healing.

<p>
	It wasn't really a voice, it was pure Infinite Intelligence expressing itself through me. It was totally direct. There was no sense of "other". I was simply speaking to myself, since there is in fact no other possibility. I was too conscious for there to be someone other than me in the room.
</p>

<p>
	It's really no different than solving a geometric proof. Who are you asking if the proof is true? You! The truth of the proof is seen by the intelligence of your own mind. So it's just like mathematics, but deeper.
</p>

<p>
	Do you talk to God when you do mathematics? Think about that. How do you know 5x5=25? By who's authority? Does a voice tell you it is true?

<p>
	It sounds exactly like you, since you are it.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Intelligence has no form whatsoever. Yet it manifests itself through all form. It's tricky that way. Any time the Godhead tries to manifest itself, dumb humans confuse that form with what it is. So if it comes to you looking like Jesus, you start to imagine that God looks like Jesus. But God doesn't look or sound like anything. It is you!

			Which profession is closer to the highest manifestation of love? Being an artist maybe? Or your profession doesn't matter at all? What is the relationship between self actualization and love?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is an infinite number of ways to manifest Love. So I wouldn't limit it to any one profession. The whole point of Love is that is literally Infinite! Everything is a manifestation of Love.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, the ultimate profession is becoming a mystic/Bodhisattva because only a hardcore mystic will ever fully realize what Love is. Ordinary people, including artists, just aren't conscious enough to realize how deep Love goes. They also aren't selfless and pure enough to manifest Love in it purest form. Their bodies and minds are too corrupted by ego, culture, and defilements. So their work is nice, but it pales in comparison to the work of someone like Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	To manifest love at the highest levels you must become conscious of what Love truly is, and then you must completely rid yourself of yourself (see quote in my sig). And then whatever you do after that doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
	This is usually only achieved by full-time monks and mystics. And even then it's rare. It's not easy for a human to perfectly reflect God. You'd basically have to surrender your entire life to do it. Which is why it's so rarely done and awesome.
</p>

<p>
	If you really care about Love, devote your life to the way of the Bodhisattva and you won't regret it. And make sure you do some 5-MeO-DMT along the way.
</p>

			Actually, I've thought the same thing. I do both life-coaching and Tarot reading (both as lines of work), and they're quite similar.

			The main difference with the Tarot, in facilitating a person to find their own answers is that you're using a visual framing device, that has a more direct link to the archetypal/narrative aspects of the mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, the Tarot is a lot like a vehicle that can drive you to aspects of the mind that you would have a much harder time reaching without that vehicle. The difference between trying to walk across the desert versus driving.

	Read the Stanford article on idealism. It's explained there.
</p>

<p>
	Epistemtic idealism means that human knowledge is a construction of the mind. Ontological idealism means that physical reality is a construction of the mind.

<p>
	Hume is nice for starting philosophy but ultimately he's wrong in many foundational ways.

<p>
	Heraclitus is good but there's so little of him to read. It's just a handful of lines.
</p>

<p>
	Epictetus is great
</p>

<p>
	Kant is an epistemic idealist. He doesn't go far enough. What he's missing is ontological idealism.

<p>
	You're better off just reading summaries of such philosopher's work on Standard Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Otherwise you'll waste years read dense books which only make you more confused than you began.

<p>
	That's the whole problem of communication and abstract philosophical work. It's often impossible to really understand.
</p>

<p>
	Some philosophical writing is abstract that there is literally not enough information in the book to clearly know when it meant.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I shower you guys with so many examples. It's only from lots of examples can you understand the abstractions.
</p>

<p>
	Honestly, Kant is not worth your time to read. Kant is not nearly a profound as people make him out to be. Various distinctions he makes are confused and deluded.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to read some good Western philosophy, try Plotinus or Berkeley.
</p>

	The problem is you cannot think your way out of this. You need a change in your state of consciousness. This can be done either via a psychedelic or very intense concentration/mindfulness practice.

<p>
	Of course there are a billion traps to maximizing love. That is what all of evolution is doing, and you think us humans can write it out in some kind of bulleted list?
</p>

<p>
	To understand how to maximize love best you must learn to tap into God Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And even then it will be messy and full of traps.

<p>
	The way you frame this is already a big problem.
</p>

<p>
	This distinction you make between mindset problems and actual problems is itself a mindset problem!
</p>

<p>
	What if all problems were nothing but your mindset towards them? Contemplate the significance of that.

</p>

<p>
	But it's not the only factor. There are other aspects of development, like how much emotional baggage and trauma is stored in your body.

<p>
	Depends on how you do it. If you smoke massive doses, sure.
</p>

<p>
	But if you plug moderate doses, then no.
</p>

<p>
	And if you do it properly it can actually be healing.

			Seems like a lot of you guys are doing these powerful psychedelics extremely often, do you believe in an integration period? Is there benefit to doing it so often? Like from my understanding 5 meo is the most intense experience the human psyche can undergo, is it just like that on the regular after repeated use? I mean if you are doing the most profound experience you could possibly imagine on a weekly or monthly basis, what is the rush to jump back in so quickly besides escaping your baseline mind state? This is not a criticism, am just curious 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's all relative.
</p>

<p>
	There have been times where I did it only once a year. And there have been times where I did 13 days in a row.
</p>

<p>
	The more advanced you get the more often you can do it without needing a lot of integration time.
</p>

<p>
	They key is to be intuitive about. Don't get set any rigid or dogmatic schedule. Do it as you're called to do it. Sometimes you will not be called for months. And sometimes you'll be called to hit it hard several days back to back.
</p>

<p>
	The most I grew in my life was from 13 back to back days. Words cannot describe the levels of superhuman insight gained. The entire universe became known to me. I had to really force myself to do it back to back 13 times. Your mind won't want to do it that much. Most people would feel like they've gone insane. It requires a really good theoretical foundation in nonduality.

<p>
	A friend of mine once did a Tarot reading of me.
</p>

<p>
	It was surprising good.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that it predicts your future, but rather is works by getting your own mind to clarify its own desires and obstacles.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like an occult form of life coaching, where the answers don't come from the coach but from the mind of the person being coached.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make regarding Tarot is thinking of it as some fortune telling device. It's not that.

<p>
	You are very naive about how corporations do business & about white collar crime.
</p>

<p>
	The entire political system is deliberately designed to redistribute wealth upwards to the most powerful. There is nothing arbitrary about it. That is right-wing trickle down economics.
</p>

<p>
	Weakening the government by going the "limited government" route will only make this problem worse.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be a limited government when greater levels of social organization require massively complex management systems. You cannot have all of today's modern technological luxuries while also organizing government via caveman politics.
</p>

<p>
	With caveman government you get caveman lifestyle.

<p>
	Your views of how government and capitalism work are very naive.
</p>

<p>
	Capitalism IS a redistribution of resources to giant corporations and the most powerful and manipulative people, which undermines democracy. Social democracy is a check on that redistribution of wealth to elites. Elites use capitalism to extract massive amounts of wealth from the rest of society regardless of the damage it causes.
</p>

<p>
	Democracy + capitalism is a contradiction. There is no such thing. If you have capitalism you have anti-democracy because money buys all politicians. This leads to corporatism, plutocracy, and corruption. Corruption is not a function of evil people doing bad things, it's a function of money infecting the democratic process in a systemic way.

<p>
	The Kochtopus is still thriving. It goes way beyond any one individual. It's an ideology and a super-organism that takes on a life of its own.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to The Family Netflix documentary. Just because Doug Kho is dead, doesn't mean The Family isn't a big problem in politics.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise with Trumpism. Trumpism will be a problem even after Trump leaves office because it is a larger ideological force.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about attacking Trump, it's about making people aware of the larger systemic forces and self-deceptions at work which lead to devils like Trump and Koch bros to thrive.
