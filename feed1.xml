	It might happen. We'll see. But don't get attached to it happening, as that just creates more suffering.

		<p>
			Thank you for the nice responses.
		</p>

		<p>
			Leo, when are you going to invite us to your seminar? Are we going to meet you this year? Have you decided to postpone with seminars?
		</p>

		<p>
			I am so depressed lately, I do not see any reason to keep going. The more I think about the possibility of being infinite, the more depressed I become.  I wish from all my heart I meet you and other people who follow this pursuit. Sometimes, it is unbearable and feels so lonely. Would be nice to attain your convention for some "fresh air" and positive energy and offset. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I understand that my mental state is temporary, but I wish I can get out of it as soon as I can. What book would you recommend to read or what practices should I do? I want to be happy again. I used to be happy when did something meaningful or hobby, now nothing excites me anymore, even traveling.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thank you so much, 
		</p>

		<p>
			Lots of hugs.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Unfortunately happiness cannot be attained as an external condition or even an internal condition. Happiness is simply accepting whatever arises, however it is, no matter how "bad" it is.
</p>

<p>
	Meeting me will not really make you happy. I wish it were that easy.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than trying to get out of your mental state the counter-intuitive move is to just accept it, make peace with it. And that is what ends up making it okay.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, you can also act your way out of a funk. Like going outside for a jog or listening to some music. But that is not a permanent solution.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes this work is just fucking hard.
</p>

<p>
	* hug *
</p>

	I am not going to play debating games with you guys.

<p>
	I've told you how 5-MeO-DMT works. If you don't want to listen, that's your problem not mine, and I will explain no further.

</p>

<p>
	This is significant, but also keep in mind that this is just one case study, and people can be very different, especially when it comes to health issues.
</p>

<p>
	Awakened people can have health complications and even mental issues or energetic issues or shadow. Do not expect them to be impervious to stress, and under enough stress even an awakened person should be expected to crack at some point.
</p>

<p>
	Again, a lot of this confusion is caused by having overly simplistic and binary notions of awakening/liberation, where you guys think that it's total and there is zero suffering and you are a Terminator. That's a very cartoonish understanding of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	It is not clear what the cause of Martin's issues are. So don't jump to hasty conclusions.
</p>

<p>
	Let's monitor his case and see how things turn out for him and what larger lessons his situation holds, if any.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like this might be part of his spiritual path. This might be his way of purifying himself even further to reach deeper levels of self-mastery. Or it could be some rare health condition. It's hard to say.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you are not conscious then no amount of words can help you. But by chasing consciousness you cut yourself off from the very perfection which you are seeking.
</p>

<p>
	It's the classic paradox of spiritual seeking.
</p>

<p>
	How do you walk a path which has zero steps? And yet you would be a fool not to walk it.
</p>

<p>
	So in practice we must do some kind of practices.

	Locking this because I feel the examples posted here will mislead many people, since Coral is so poorly understood.
</p>

<p>
	You guys are in no position to talk about Coral.
</p>

<p>
	Focus instead on mastering the lower stages. Most of you still do not understand what Yellow and Turquoise are, let alone some hypothetical Coral.

<p>
	And that too is perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Perfection doesn't actually come from perfect embodiment but from realizing that perfection is always the case no matter how you feel or what you do. This radical level of self-love is the cure to all problems because it does not need to cure anything, it just accepts it.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive to how the ego imagines perfection. The ego's version of perfection is actually hell because it imagines a state in the future where all conditions will be favorable to it. And this will never come, causing great suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Perfection is an Absolute. It is NOW! NOW! NOW! It is EVERYTHING!
</p>

<p>
	But politics is a relative affair.

	BTW, Bernie IS an independent! He's an indepedent senator. He's merely running as a Democrat because it is practical.

Yang will reduce welfare programs to fund his UBI, then when the Republicans come back into power years later they will just end the UBI and the welfare programs would already be crippled. Thus creating big step back.
</p>

<p>
	One of the key problems with UBI is that it's so easy to end it. What's necessary is to build deep-rooted infrastructure and systems which cannot be cut easily in the future, like Medicare and Social Security.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately the UBI has no infrastructure behind it, making it weak to cutting.

	Trading stocks is a bad idea overall because you are not actually generating any value for the world. So the likelihood of failure is enormous.

But the higher the stage the more consistent it tends to be.
</p>

<p>
	It varies a lot from person to person.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Orange can have high integrity. Howard Stern might be a good example.

</p>

<p>
	Guys, watch the dualistic framing of your questions very carefully.
</p>

<p>
	Sloppy framing leads to poor understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Just by framing your question as me vs you, that's already wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Me = you
</p>

<p>
	By distinguishing me from you, you create my ego and your ego simultaneously. Self/other is the very first duality.

Anti-capitalism is a trap. There needs to be an intelligent synthesis of capitalism and socialism. Which is really already the case. We do not live in a purely capitalist system and we never have.

	Whatever you imagine to be real will appear real to you. And there is nothing outside you.

		</p>

			If the answer is both why can't I experience your perspective right now? Why can't I teleport my soul into your body right now, see the couch you're sitting on, see the camera you use to make actualized.org videos right now?

			If I am just a perspective, and you reached total omnipresence, you should be able to experience right now my perspective(if both of us are just endoscopes) you should be able to switch between endoscopes.

<p>
	Both of course!
</p>

<p>
	You ARE experiencing my perspective! That just means you are living my life and have zero knowledge of ever having been you. Which is literally what I am. I am just you minus all your memories and experiences, plus all of my memories and experiences.
</p>

<p>
	My life is your life. Your life is my life. When you become me, you become fully me! Which means no more old you.

</p>

<p>
	Which is why Trump is such a terrible leader. He does not even know the meaning of that word.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie has amazing integrity. High integrity comes with consciousness. So as our society becomes better as elevating the consciousness of all citizens, we will have more high-integrity leaders (and followers).

			Great video, lot of deep stuff.
		</p>

		<p>
			The only thing I'd add is to what you said is that from my experience there comes a time in which there is no going in to find a god head (or out), there is nothing that is not god/head, the experience of those phenomenon (going in or out) and the differences that are experienced as such, visible and known (the appearance of differences, spiritual experience vs mundane everyday, more conscious vs less conscious, what is known as god vs what is just its forms and not god) are itself god/head....
		</p>

		<p>
			Another thing that I found is God tricking itself is not a negative (it may not be a trick), its not a problem, its not something to see as wrong that has happened, that "people" are deliberately" deluding themselves.  There are no people, but god happening as it wants to, living the human experience, the dog experience, the alien experience and in my opinion is to be celebrated, met with heart and love of myself.

<p>
	The whole process of awakening is full of suffering because the ego has to processes all of its own bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	But this a purification process. So it's positive in the long-run.
</p>

<p>
	No pain no gain. The devil will not leave your body peacefully or quietly. There will be moments of great self-doubt and self-loathing.

<title>Presidential candidate Andrew Yang</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/35961-presidential-candidate-andrew-yang/?do=findComment&amp;comment=443979</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I am well aware of Yang.
</p>

<p>
	I watched many of his interviews and speeches.
</p>

<p>
	He is definitely very authentic, smart, and in some ways visionary.
</p>

<p>
	But I have some serious problems with his proposals:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		He uses UBI as a universal solution to too many issues. UBI is good but it cannot solve all the problems he proposes.
	</li>
	<li>
		He wants to fund UBI through VAT taxes, which is a bad idea in my opinion because it is a tax on the poor not the rich.
	</li>
	<li>
		His UBI also goes to rich people who don't need it at all and it counts against other government benefits like social security and food stamps.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is against free college for all.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is against Medicare For All.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is against $15 minimum wage.
	</li>
	<li>
		He seems to hold some libertarian notions.
	</li>
	<li>
		He does not directly question the structural problems of capitalism itself.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Yang is good, but Bernie is better. If Bernie proposed a UBI, Yang would basically have nothing left to stand on. I think Bernie should propose a UBI in addition to everything else he stands for.
</p>

<p>
	I give Yang lots of credit for proposing UBI in the first place, and for talking about job automation.
</p>

<p>
	The final problem is: he simply doesn't poll well. I don't think he has a serious chance of winning the primary. Of course that could change, but Bernie has much better odds in my estimation.
</p>

<p>
	But in the end if Yang wins, I would be happy too.
</p>

	I have warned you guys so many times about self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	Go back and re-watch my self-deception 3 part series. It's very important and you still don't appreciate how serious this problem is.
</p>

<p>
	This work is devilishly tricky.
</p>

<p>
	No, you cannot use concepts or science if you wish to understand the deepest levels of what reality is. There is no reason why you should feel entitled to that.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, I use concepts all the time to teach, but the difference is, I understand their limitation whereas you do not.

<p>
	Illusion IS reality.
</p>

<p>
	So if you think you have a past, you literally do! However you hold reality is what becomes real for you. Since you are God.
</p>

<p>
	What people don't generally understand is the constructive nature of the mind. Reality is not a given. It is constructed by you. People do not like to take responsibility for being The Creator. It is a radical degree of responsibility.

<p>
	Of course there are dangerous. Awakening is a very radical thing. We are basically talking about renouncing your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	There will be times when you will feel depressed, insane, and even suicidal. All of this comes with territory.
</p>

<p>
	And there are many more dangers. Too many to list them all.

<p>
	1) You haven't seen the full depth of it. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
	2) People need to understand how radical this work is. Otherwise they are deceived. It's important to properly communicate how it FEELS from the subjective POV of the ordinary human. To play it off cool is just dishonest. It is incredibly radical. And it is dramatic. It is not a walk in the park to realize God. So let's not pretend it is.

		<p>
			Are you an unexisting bot? Are you an illusion here just for MY benefit? This, MY EGO'S benefit? Didn't think so...

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Notice, the final arbiter of that is you. It is actually you who is decided if he is a bot. If solipsism is true, then you are the only thing in existence, and you call all the shots. So the only one who determines whether he is a bot or not is you. So if you tell yourself, "He isn't a bot", that's what becomes true for you.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you imagine is true, is what is true for you. Since you are God imagining the whole world. If you believe this world is real and not imagined by you, that's you imagining that you aren't imagining it, therefore making it real for you. If you stop believing this world is real, it will stop being real.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is this: because you have a dogmatic position that solipsism cannot possibly be true, you do not realize your own fully authority as the creator of reality. You have literally cut yourself off from your own authority, projecting this authority onto an imagination "other" or "world". And of course that is precisely how you create yourself as this limited human puppet. You have actually managed to convince yourself that there is an external world with physical laws which were not created by you. But the truth is, you created the whole world and then cut yourself off from the fact that you created it. And thus a human being was born. You were not born as some biological creature. You simply imagined your parents and hallucinated a life backstory for yourself. In truth, you were never born. You just tell yourself you were.
</p>

<p>
	So right now you are imagining that solipsism cannot be true and I'm full of shit. And so that is what becomes true for you.
</p>

<p>
	All of your childhood memories are things you're imagining RIGHT NOW! They only seem to have happened because you think so. And so that becomes true for you.

</p>

<p>
	Those are the true mechanics of reality. There never was a physical world at all. Nor was there a human self. Nor are there other people. It is ALL YOU! All by yourself playing this twisted game of infinite imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Neat, huh?

<p>
	What's true is that you are God, God is all alone, and God is imagining everything.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness cannot help being solipsistic. It is ONE! Not two.
</p>

<p>
	But of course one includes two and all the rest. So in this sense it's not the standard Wikipedia version of solipsism. It's actually way more radical and insane.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth <u>feels</u> very solipsistic. Because it is you! And there exists nothing but you.

	It's an important one.
</p>

<p>
	You need to get good at just taking an action when you find yourself paralyzed by indecision.
</p>

<p>
	You can take an issue which confuses and compartmentalize it, setting it aside for another day. But in the meantime you can take some kind of action.
</p>

<p>
	And also sometimes it okay to be lost & lazy. That's a normal phase of life. See my video about: Chapter & Phases Of Life

			A conscious politician would not identify and would be at an advantage over a semi-conscious reactive opponent, who relies on handlers and P. R. Experts to keep them out of trouble.

<p>
	The problem is more tricky than that.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is this: a conscious politician would be a decent human being. By virtue of this, he/she would not be very manipulative nor stoop to dirty and unfair tactics. But an unconscious politician would not be limited in this way. He/she would manipulate to the max and act like a devil. This devilry would give him a huge advantage against the conscious person when it comes to capturing the public's attention.
</p>

<p>
	This is exactly what Trump and far right-wing people do. They have no shame because they are unconscious and absolutistic in their ignorance. And even in the rare case when a highly conscious leader manages to get elected, he is usually quickly killed or demonized to the point where his reputation is tarnished beyond repair.
</p>

<p>
	And in this way, devilry and falsehood sustains itself. It always loses in the long-run, but the short-run it can be very powerful.
</p>

<p>
	This is a profoundly deep and difficult problem. It has no easy resolution, requiring us to go through war, conflict, violence, debate, anger, etc. Which is why human history has been so violent. War is a feature, not a bug.
</p>

<p>
	Ignorance cannot help but be ignorant.
</p>

<p>
	There are many business courses and seminars which teach you the how-to.
</p>

<p>
	But mostly the how-to of business is learned by simply doing it. You make it up as you go along and follow your vision. Business requires strong vision & lots of studying your target market. You need to develop deep expertise in whatever market you're trying to enter.

<p>
	Those are your own expectations. No guru is obligated to meet your scientific standards in a lab like a rat in a maze.
</p>

<p>
	And you have no idea how many materialization have been demonstrated or repeated, because most of them would never get documented due to the very cynicism you're displaying. If you expect not to see something, you won't see it.

</p>

<p>
	Don't be so cynical. Extraordinary healing is certainly possible and materialization is within the realm of possibility. It's not so farfetched.
</p>

<p>
	And just because some people in the past have been fakes does not mean the fundamental phenomenon is bogus. Just like with enlightenment, there have been many fake people claiming the existence of God, yet God is still real. Once you realize that God is real, almost anything becomes possible.
</p>

<p>
	Be open but also grounded. It's a delicate balancing act. Notice, I did not just accept the video at face-value. To me that video is ambiguous and not definitive proof. But it is interesting.

It overcomes this problem by smoothening the trip so you can really understand what is going on, not just be blindsided and take away nothing.

I meant, for example, someone was trying to hide his/her "deepest, darkest secret," and this person isn't telling you what it is because this person feels uncomfortable. But, you cannot help this person if you don't know. Then, all of a sudden, you got the insight in full details without this person telling you, and you're able to help this person.

			Leo has made a few different awakening videos, saying he goes deeper and deeper. Perhaps he ends up going deeper and deeper. I will say that on the whole the concepts in all the videos feel identical. I'm just a bit confused when Leo thinks he's experienced states of consciousness beyond what is taught in conventional non-dual wisdom, I mean to me it sounds like Leo and Hinduism for example are saying the same thing. For example Alan Watts gives the analogy of the fact that everyone is a different expression of God, and that you're playing hide and seek with yourself. And the ideas of formlessness, the void being beyond all language.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The basics of what I'm saying doesn't contradict classic nondual teachings of course. It's just a question of how deeply you realize what God is. God can understand itself at deeper and deeper levels.
</p>

<p>
	The highest truth is that you are God. But how deeply do you understand what that really entails?

<p>
	My point about the 2008 recession was that the banking industry and Wall Street were not properly regulated due to anti-regulation stance of the conservative/libertarian administration.
</p>

<p>
	Those industries are still not properly regulated and exploit and steal from many Americans. Wall Street is very corrupt and also corrupts all our elected leaders with their stolen and exploited money. This is not good for raising the consciousness of Americans.
</p>

<p>
	Wall Street and giant banks are allowed to be breeding grounds for devils. It's utterly corrupt and exploitative. No conscious society would allow such a thing. Most people do not fully understand how corrupt these systems are. And Trump only adds fuel to the fire by appointing these devils to his administration.

			I did. Hitting a breakthrough with N,N-DMT is significantly harder, which is why majority of people are unable to. It requires to have a good theoretical foundation and understanding of non-duality. Why? Because it is not strong enough to simply overpower the EGO, like 5-MEO can.
		</p>

		<p>
			When you vape 5-MEO, you can either surrender or resist it. If you surrender into experience(considering you have the right dosage), you will have a breakthrough, even if you lack that solid theoretical foundation of non-duality.
		</p>

		<p>
			I can confirm this not only from my own experience, but other people who I know - who couldn't get a breakthrough with N-DMT, but got it through vaping 5-MEO. The difference is day and night.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you have the option to do 5-MEO, I would advice people to just go straight to 5-MEO.
		</p>

<p>
	I look forward to comparing both breakthroughs.

<p>
	There are many ways to reach Absolute Love. Psychedelics are not required. But they sure make it easy.

			Also, what do you think about the quote "Unearned consciousness is valueless" in connection to psychedelics, I heard David Deida and Ken Wilber say that, so I was questioning, also how much formal practice is necessary to make a psychedelic experience valuable or does it depend more upon theory or more ambiguous factors such as predispositions, environment, brain chemistry even, or past life experiences, karma, etc ? 
		</p>

<p>
	I reject the notion that consciousness has to be "earned". You are God! You don't have to "earn" anything to know yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's not a magic pill. You still need to do lots of other work on yourself.

<p>
	I have not gotten deep enough into Kriya yoga to see what kind of awakening it produces.

<p>
	Of course, that is omniscience. God is all-knowing but in a far more radical way than human knowledge.

<p>
	Knowing and Being are one. God knows everything by being everything.

<title>Leo, What Teachers Have Had The Same Realizations As You?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	What I have personally experienced has taken me beyond all teachers that I have studied. This is not to denigrate other teachers. There just comes a time where you go beyond what can be taught.
</p>

<p>
	At peak omniscience I become aware of limitations in the teachings of even the greatest masters.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Ralston does not teach about Absolute Love, and this is a big oversight from my experience. To not teach Love is nuts! It's totally fundamental. I cannot hold someone who denies Love as having reached the highest level of consciousness. And I like Ralston very much. But I like Love more.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear, I can still learn from teachers. There are always many minor things to learn.
</p>

<p>
	But the deepest truth must be gotten direct from the source: yourself.
</p>

<p>
	That's exactly what happens with lots of psychedelic use. Each trip produces a big breakthrough. Then you drop back to baseline, but not entirely. And with each such trip your awareness expands, expands, expands, gradually, until one day you find yourself very wake effortlessly. It's a process of both sudden and gradual awakening.

<p>
	It will be closer to vaping than aya I would imagine. Similar to how 5-MeO works.
</p>

<p>
	I think plugging it will be really really good. But don't know for sure yet.

<p>
	Depends on what you want.
</p>

<p>
	DMT is better for seeing new worlds and aliens.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is best for ego-death & pure awakening to yourself as God.

<p>
	I think they can both be equally powerful but in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is not visually powerful.
</p>

<p>
	There is something very freaky about your entire visual field getting replaced in 1 minute.

I got this very quickly and it left the lasting impression on me that this is serious stuff not to be taken lightly. I felt like if I had gone deeper I would of been shown many profound things. Was kinda spooky when my first major awakening (dxm+lsd) left me shattered mentally for about a week. Changed forever. I don't regret it though. The tough experiences you really learn from.

<p>

They tried to blame him for inciting people against Rome, because they had a hard time coming up with a good reason to crucify him but he never did that. He told people to pay their taxes and he resisted when they tried to force him into becoming a king. Jesus was a healer and a spiritual teacher. He knew his life purpose and stuck to it. He didn't try to be a radical, it just happened to be the case.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	My point about Jesus was not his politics but the fact that he was a radical in his time. You think the rabbis of his time weren't upset with him? A guy who came along and starts a whole new version of Judaism? Proclaiming to be the son of God? Ordinary folks in that era would have perceived this as outrageous radicalism of the highest order. Utter blasphemy and disrespect of tradition. If the Romans hadn't killed him the Jews might have.

			I do see your point but is there no room for mediators and compromises? Isn't that the purpose of understanding other people and using the model of spiral dynamics? Too much change too soon causes collective ego backlash, and that's what Trump embodies. We have a two party system, and an electoral college that decides for us. If the popular vote decided the election Hillary Clinton would have won. Rural American gets more weight in elections and you have to apply your understanding of spiral dynamics. Bernie might work out. He had a great shot in the last election but we can sit here and blame the DNC and corruption there for that. Bernie better understands rural America and how to speak to people. I think he is seen as too polarizing now. 
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Our problem is not too much change too soon. The planet is dying. We need radical change 30 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	Just because there is an ego backlash does not mean we stop pushing for much-needed reform. There is always ego backlash. This is nothing new. Don't let fear of ego backlash prevent you from making the right moves which you know will help people.
</p>

<p>
	You think the abolition of slavery didn't come with a backlash? What were folks supposed to do? Maintain slavery simply because the slave owners would bitch about losing their slaves? Those in power always bitch about how unfair it is that their power is being taken away.

			You're very well educated, and you've spent your life around people who are also well educated. Spend some time living in rural America and you'll have a different world view.  I'm not sure that you realize how intimidating a politician who doesn't hide their intelligence is to people who don't have a good education. You have to know how to talk to people on their level. Bernie knows this. Hillary Clinton had little understanding of it and neither does Elizabeth Warren. Warren would be my top pick if it was up to me, but it's incredibly difficult for anyone to come off as both highly intelligent, capable AND down to earth.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I agree that uneducated people tend to dislike highly educated wonks. I think Bernie doesn't have this problem. Bernie comes across as an ordinary guy, not an elite university professor. This is a potential problem for Warren. But again, this is an image problem, not a substantive one.

		</p>

<p>
	Conscious politics requires that you stop thinking about your personal agenda so much. There are larger issues here beyond whether you will personally benefit from a policy. Besides, your children might benefit. And you will benefit if we live in a society where most people are well-educated rather than bigots who believe every piece of right-wing propaganda.
</p>

<p>
	This year I personally gained $40,000 in tax refund thanks to Trump. The government literally mailed me a check for $40,000. Next year I will probably get another $40,000. So for me, Bernie is terrible. I will lose so much money with him in office. But I don't let my personal finances get in the way of what is right for the country at large. That is conscious politics. It's not about what's best for me. It's about what's best for the majority of people and what equalizes consciousness. Giving rich people like me $40,000 does not help to equalize consciousness, it does the opposite. Nor did I vote to get a tax cut.

<p>
	It's quite the paradox.
</p>

<p>
	When I am fully conscious, there is no one left to awaken. All my work is self-entertainment.
</p>

<p>
	When you fully awake you will realize there isn't anyone here but you. But you will also quickly drop back down into conventional reality and treat other people as if they are real and objective. You can't really help it. It's just practical and works for purposes of survival.

<p>
	This one's a bit tricky and I'm still a bit unsure about it. I will clarify it soon.
</p>

<p>
	Basically it boils down to one of these options:
</p>

<p>
	1) You don't really exist. You are just a figment of my imagination. The entire world is just for me. In other words, total solipsism.
</p>

<p>
	2) God subdivided itself into separate dimensions, one of which is mine and one of which is yours. Of course since both of us are God, both of us are being both dimensions at once. So I and you are literally one consciousness but experiencing different forms.
</p>

<p>
	What I know 100% is that the formlessness in you is the formlessness in me. The all-seeing-eye is one in every living being. But I'm not yet totally sure how other dimensions might be created. Remember, nothing is impossible to God. It can create dimensions out of thin air if it wants to.

</blockquote>

<p>
	All form is God's imagination. An insights is form, so yes it is imagined. But also insight can carry "truth". I don't know how to explain it. Insight is fundamental to consciousness. Consciousness is capable of insight. It can be self-knowing. Conscious can understand itself. That's what makes it mystical.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Oh ok you can be conscious of it and directly experience it, right? Ok but direct experience varifies it, why isn’t materialism truth? We’re here experiencing it right? What makes spirituality a direct way of accessing the truth? How does a tiny spec of dust on a tiny Earth access the truth? There’s infinite numbers of unknown galaxies and planets that we do not know of, and what if there were aliens who access the truth differently?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The answer is very radical: every object outside of your current experience right now which you think exists, is something you're imaging. If it's not directly present, it is directly present as an image. So a galaxy exists in your mind as an image. If you were to travel to space and look at a galaxy with your eyes, the galaxy would now be created for you by you.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bit like a video game rendering engine. It does not render the world other than what the player is able to see right now. There really isn't a "world", there is only what's rendered at any given moment.
</p>

<p>
	Your birth and death are something you're imagining, for example. When you realize that, you will become immortal in that instant. Until you start imagining your birth and death again. Then you will become mortal. The way you were born is that you imagined you were born. And so it was.

The static world you used to live in was miserable and full of fear. Now that you see it's all an illusion you can love it all to the hilt and be joyful because you have absolutely nothing to lose.
</p>

<p>
	You need to go deeper. Your ego is misconstruing things, projecting its own problems on it.

<p>
	You expect all spiritual people to agree? Why do you think no two spiritual people agree 100%?

<p>
	I have no problem vaping 5-MeO and I will do it. I have no dogma against it. I simply have been busy with other things.

			It's a bigger contradiction than you think, if you look closely enough. According to him, ego wants to understand and know everything, and that is not necessary at all, when it comes to liberation. Even the title of the chapter is "Liberation through unknowing". 
		</p>

		<p>
			He specifically stated that gathering understanding and insights is not needed when it comes to using 5-MEO - it's a desire of the ego. It's a HUGE contradiction. And this is also one of the reasons why you don't prefer to vaping it, because you would not be able to as many insights after the trip.

		<p>
			It's a clear as a day to me.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a non-issue.
</p>

<p>
	You are acting as though insight is something wrong or bad. This is absurd. The whole point of the spiritual path is to gain deeper insight into the nature of self, God, reality, and life. This is not "ego." This is self-recognition at a fine-grained level.
</p>

<p>
	As God I enjoy studying myself in many different ways. If you don't want that, then do whatever you want. I could spend 1 million years studying myself. And I will.
</p>

<p>
	My path is what's known as Jnana yoga. It's an intellect oriented path. Other people prefer a heart oriented path. I like to dissect stuff and make sense of it.
</p>

<p>
	Anti-intellectualism is not a requirement of awakening. You can do both. The Jnana yoga path is very documented in history.

<p>
	Not really. You suggest they use that word in a binary way whereas I use it more as matters of degree.
</p>

<p>
	You can map a binary model onto a non-binary model.

<p>
	It's like one person says: there exist cats and dogs.

<p>

<p>
	I don't recall saying that either.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously the more conscious you are, the less you will tend to act like a devil. But if you slip up and act like a devil anyway (which does happen), that is okay too.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, it's not such a big contradiction as you think.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I emphasize understanding and insight more than Martin does. But this does not contradict anything. I am simply interested in insight and understanding. It is definitely possible to understand yourself as God and all of the facets which you are. Not in a rational linguistic manner.
</p>

<p>
	Understanding and Being are ultimately one. So there's no serious contradiction here, just a difference in emphasis.
</p>

<p>
	It's not merely the ego that wants to know. God is waking up to itself. God wants to know what it is. Don't dismiss this as mere ego.
</p>

<p>
	Martin has a certain style of working with 5-MeO and I have my own style. Different people have different styles of doing this work. And that's okay. Find your own fave style.
</p>

<p>
	I do "energetic experiencing and processing too" on my trips. It's not as though I sit there and conceptualize stuff on the trip, LOL. Having insights and understanding and doing energetic process work well together. Don't make it a false dichotomy. You can have it all!
</p>

			Do you understand that the people who you consider to be enlightened frame it this way? One of whom took 10x more 5-MEO than you have. Martin W Ball makes it very clear and that is how he described his own process. He had many "non-dual experiences" until he totally liberated himself.
		</p>

		<p>
			Eckhart Tolle who you also consider to be enlightened, defines enlightenment as the end of suffering (psychological), and full awakeness, always having non-dual awareness in the background, and in the present moment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There comes a point in your evolution where you must throw away all so called authority futures. You must kill the Buddha to become the Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	I cannot speak to anyone's experience but my own.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really contradict Ball or Tolle. We agree more than we disagree. We all fundamentally agree on nonduality being the Truth. The rest is minutia.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			This is again where other people who you consider to be "enlightened" would disagree. Guys like Eckhart Tolle, and Rupert Spira would tell you that morals are there to limit the EGO, and once the person becomes conscious, morals are no longer needed. They are saying that actions that you consider "immoral" are usually very egoic by nature, so it doesn't make any sense for an enlightened being to go around murdering people. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Also based from my own "awakenings", I noticed what they are saying is true - the desire to commit "immoral" actions reduces tenfold automatically.  Which makes me doubt some of the things that you are saying, it reminds me of "zen delivery" very much.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, I have never said that your desire to commit "immoral" actions will increase. I simply said that no matter what action you take, you will love yourself if you are fully conscious. This is total liberation: you are free to do whatever you want and still love yourself. This does not mean you will become a serial killer.
</p>

<p>
	This is so obvious I shouldn't even have to qualify it.
</p>
