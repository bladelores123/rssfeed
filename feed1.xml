	IPEC is about as good as they get. You can find others which are similar but the price range will be similar too.
</p>

<p>
	Be ware of cheap and fast programs.

<p>
	Of course, all else being equal I still buy organic vs not.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't naively assume that "organic" means it's safe. There's plenty of "organic" poison on the market shelves.

<p>
	There is no perfect method.
</p>

<p>
	But here's a decent place to start:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.puremarket.com/search/food" rel="external nofollow">https://www.puremarket.com/search/food</a>
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="" data-ipsquote-contentapp="forums" data-ipsquote-contentclass="forums_Topic" data-ipsquote-contentcommentid="800632" data-ipsquote-contentid="59098" data-ipsquote-contenttype="forums" data-ipsquote-timestamp="1609340839" data-ipsquote-userid="765" data-ipsquote-username="7thLetter">

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Look, for example, at how many organic foods get F ratings on heavy metal toxicity:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.puremarket.com/search/food?menu%5Bfacet_lab_grade%5D=F&refinementList%5Btaxonomies.pm-product-diet%5D%5B0%5D=Organic" rel="external nofollow">https://www.puremarket.com/search/food?menu[facet_lab_grade]=F&refinementList[taxonomies.pm-product-diet][0]=Organic</a>
</p>

<p>
	You can even compare them to the non-organic versions which sometimes get A ratings.
</p>

<p>
	It all depends. There's no simple formula here. Any product can be bad, no matter what the label or brand.

	You don't need Red Pill for that. Just study some David DeAngelo courses and GO TALK TO GIRLS!

<p>
	Red Pill was started by a bunch of bitter, toxic, whiny men who spend more time on Reddit than they do talking to girls.

<title>Lower Consciousness after Eating</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Of course
</p>

<p>
	Digesting food diverts blood from your brain to the stomach. You will always be more conscious on an empty stomach.
</p>

<p>
	The digestion of food is quite an energy intensive process for the body.
</p>

<p>
	And if you eat low-quality food, the downsides to consciousness will be even more pronounced.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why fasting has been used for spiritual work since the dawn of time.
</p>

<p>
	Most people won't awaken simply due to the garbage food they eat.
</p>

			Funny how all of your "How to attract girls" advice is the same stuff as the red pill says. Being confident, masculine, assertive, dominant, not caring about the girl until she has fallen for you, being detached, being edgy, emotional stimulating the girl, doing numbers game, cold approaching, ALL OF IT is red pill stuff.

	You'll be shocked to learn that organic products can have more toxic stuff them than inorganic.

<p>
	It's funny that Americans and Israelis love to bomb stuff more than Arabs.
</p>

<p>
	But good luck getting Ben Shapiro to see that.

<p>
	It encompasses concept and can go beyond it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like it when people denigrate concept as if it's some evil or dirty thing. Most of your life is lived thanks to concepts and you're not escaping that any time soon.

	It's hard to take a person seriously when they support Ben Shapiro. But David Hawkins has some brilliant spiritual work. Just don't go to him to learn your politics.

	Source is one of his books. Forget exactly which one -- he has so many. It's one of the ones on my book list.

<p>
	Hawkins had a very pro-conservative and anti-progressive politics.

<p>
	Here's some more fuel for the fire:
</p>

<p>
	In one video James Swartz (enlightened guy) talked about how if he saw a rat in his hotel room he would not hesitate to stomp it dead with his shoe.
</p>

<p>
	In 500 years, if spiritual people hear that statement they will wonder: how could this enlightened teacher be such a monster and not have a sense of animal rights?
</p>

<p>
	Hell, some stage Green unenlightened people have a higher sense of animal rights and compassion today than the enlightened James Swartz.
</p>

<p>
	And now, what is the fundamental difference between a Nazi killing humans he finds disgusting vs an enlightened master killing a rat he finds disgusting?
</p>

<p>
	If you kill a rat does that mean you aren't enlightened? How about a fly? How about a spider? How about a chicken? How about a tree? How about a human? Where does it stop? How big of a thing must you kill for the universe to revoke your enlightenment?
</p>

	I'm not talking about your town. I'm talking about the entire country of Israel and the stage Blue ethno-state policies they like to practice and the evils that result from such nationalism.

<p>
	Just because you point out the good parts of Israel does not counteract the bad parts. There were many good parts about Nazi Germany if you ignore the concentration camps.

<p>
	But if Yellow discourse does not enter the chat, by definition it is not a significant part of mainstream culture.
</p>

<p>
	You can't just have Yellow make appearances in academic work. I needs to be all over YT, Facebook, Twitter, and cable TV. Otherwise it hasn't really penetrated culture.
</p>

<p>
	Your grandma needs to be talking about Yellow ideas at the dinner table. Until that happens, society is very far from Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	The kinds of topics we cover on Actualized.org need to become so mainstream that Actualized.org becomes obsolete. That's what a Yellow society would look like.

<p>
	Sounds like you got a lot of work to do.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't neglect mastering basic survival aspects of life:
</p>

<p>
	If you feel lonely, make some quality friends.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel horny, learn to date.
</p>

<p>
	If you are struggling with money, master that aspect of life.

I get what you are saying but keep in mind that most Israelis come from places like Iraq, Yemen, Russia, Poland and Morocco. Israel will envolve when it's ready. I do not live in Israel but I was actually born there in a town where Arabs and Jews live together and enjoy the same rights (healthcare, voting, payment etc.). I won't deny any inequalities nor the need for a Palestinian state.<br />

			"Einstein was a prominent supporter of both Labor Zionism and efforts to encourage Jewish-Arab cooperation. He supported the creation of a Jewish national homeland in the British mandate of Palestine but was opposed to the idea of a Jewish state "with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power."
		</p>

		<p>
			He did support labor-Zionism which was the prominent stream at the time of Israel's inception. But he was against temporal power and having an army. I just think that if the jews didn't have an army they would be totally at the mercy of stage red/bue Arabs and therefore creating the possibility of a second genocide. 
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Einstein declined the Israeli presidency and spoke of the dangers of Zionism.
</p>

<p>
	I could find quotes but I'm too lazy to look for them.

<p>
	Firstly, there are plenty of Turquoise Boomers.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, just because a person is into mystical stuff does not make him Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is looking for some simplistic formula to explain the complexity of human minds, and you just won't find that. Spiral Dynamics is just a loose rule of thumb. It has plenty of edge-cases and exceptions. A model is just a model. And Spiral Dynamics does not model high stages of consciousness or mysticism well at all.

<p>
	Just to fuck with your mind's a bit more: David Hawkins sung the praises of Ben Shapiro and Shapiro's worldview while denouncing post-modernism.
</p>

<p>
	David Hawkins was a very conscious guy, spiritually speaking. But politically he was a fool. Having good politics is a separate matter from spiritual development. Politics requires years of careful study. You will not get good politics just from spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	And remember, most spiritual masters got their awakening through giftedness and super-natural talent. But you don't get good politics through talent or giftness. Good politics requires serious study and contemplation.

<p>
	All rights are imaginary inventions of the ego. No one has a right to anything, ever.
</p>

<p>
	I have no problem with Israel being a state. But the idea of a state only for one ethnicity or religion is absurd. That's called an ethnostate and is exactly what Hitler wanted. That results in evil.
</p>

<p>
	For a state to be conscious, good, and sustainable it must treat all of its citizens equally well, regardless of their ethnicity or religion. Zionists are making exactly the same mistake Hitler made in running his state.
</p>

<p>
	Israel should not be a Jewish state. It should just be a state for whoever likes to live there.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine how absurd it would be if we founded a white Christian state within America that treated everyone else as second class citizens.

	I wouldn't bet on it.

<p>
	His survival and identity is totally wrapped up with this. It will be very painful for him to admit to himself that he was so wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Trump supporters will sooner triple down than admit any wrong-doing.

<p>
	Not necessarily.
</p>

<p>
	If you were a conscious and independent-minded German who took epistemology and philosophy seriously, you might be like Einstein -- who was very outspokenly anti-Nazi and anti-nationalist. He was even against Jewish nationalism while being a Jew.
</p>

<p>
	Did you know that the Jews nominated Einstein to be the president/leader of Israel but he declined?
</p>

<p>
	Why did he decline? Because he said Jewish nationalism was as dangerous as German nationalism. And he was right. Today Jewish nationalism is leading to all sorts of evils.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to fall into the delusions of your culture. But in order to do that you must truly contemplate reality for yourself and have the courage to stand for your convictions, not just being a sheep. Most scientists, philosophers, doctors, academics, and intellectuals are sheep. A few aren't. That is what distinguishes a true genius.

<p>
	Because enlightenment does not guarantee an developed mind.
</p>

<p>
	Developing the mind, and proper use of the mind, is a very separate thing from enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	You can be enlightened and still use your mind improperly. I've seen many enlightened people do that.
</p>

<p>
	The trap here is that once you become enlightened you get the silly idea that now your mind doesn't matter and that you can use it flawlessly. Nope! You cannot escape the mind and its trickeries no matter how enlightened you get.
</p>

			You go as far as to say that certain ideas must be contemplated for a decade or more. Given the sheer magnitude of work it takes to develop big-picture understanding just from studying the theory, never mind embodying it, I don't see how it would be feasible to contemplate all the theory I study.

<p>
	You won't deeply contemplate everything you study. You selectively contemplate those aspects of reality which seem important.
</p>

<p>
	But in general, any time you learn or read something you should be contemplating it at least a little, if only for 10 or 60 minutes. Otherwise you'll just adopt a bunch of beliefs and act like a fool.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Pickup/dating/communication certainly needs to be contemplated. I've spent 100s of hours contemplating that stuff and deriving important insights.
</p>

<p>
	If you just mechanically follow some rules someone else has told you about, I guarantee your results will not be optimal and you will fall into delusion at some point. There is a lot of bad advice within pickup that you should not be following. How will you distinguish that without contemplation? Contemplation is also faster and easier and safer than field testing. You can contemplate a lot more stuff than you can field test. Field testing is just an extension of contemplation, really.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation >> Field testing >> More contemplation >> More field testing >> More contemplation

<p>
	It matters because these commentators influence culture and they are a sign of the development level of the culture. And if your political culture isn't Yellow then your society isn't Yellow and your Yellow doesn't really matter.
</p>

<p>
	And politics is very influential on how your society does things. So if your politics isn't Yellow then your society is not behaving in a Yellow manner.
</p>

<p>
	Right now in America we have a 3-way Mexican standoff between Blue, Orange, and Green, while Yellow hasn't even entered the chat.

<p>
	That's the stage Green backlash we've been seeing for the last 5 years.
</p>

<p>
	I bet he consumes a lot of alt-right social media which constantly demonizes Green, and he sees Green as undermining his masculine identity.
</p>

<p>
	The easiest way to get young men to buy into alt-right ideology is by telling them that Green wants to turn them all into queer soy-boys. A few years of such propaganda will turn a young guy hard right. That's the whole Proud Boys game.

<p>
	Hannah Arendt famously interviewed and studied Nazi officers after the war.
</p>

<p>
	What she discovered was the shocking "banality of evil." None of them was really evil. They were just being good profressional stage Blue rule followers. Mike Pence types.
</p>

<p>
	Your average Nazi was just a pawn in Hitler's schemes. Similar to your average Trump voter.
</p>

<p>
	Many German intellectuals, scientists, and philosophers were supporters of the Nazi party. Like Martin Heidegger. Because few people think for themselves about anything. Even awakened people are fucking sheep for the most part.
</p>

<p>
	You can be awake but social pressure will still drive you to delusion. People underestimate the power of culture and ideology. Awakening does not make you immune to cultural biases.
</p>

<p>
	In 500 years spiritual people will be asking, How could someone have been enlightened and still a capitalist? The same way ya'll asking about Nazis.

</p>

<p>
	When you are sleeping, watching a movie, sick with the flu, drunk... you are less conscious. Notice this.

<p>
	Be careful not to conflate conceptual frameworks with understanding.

<p>
	Understanding is a much deeper thing than concepts. You can understand beyond concept or knowledge.

<p>
	I wouldn't want to live a life without learning. That's not an addiction, it's just something I love about life.
</p>

<p>
	But also, understanding goes way beyond learning.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, any such line will be arbitrary and relative.
</p>

<p>
	You can be as theoretical or practical with your work as you like. This will be different depending on what you value most.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to dismiss theortical work as "merely mental masturbation".
</p>

<p>
	Einstein's work would have seemed like mental masturbation to most people in his day. Yet it had enormous applications decades later. And Einstein's work would have suffered if he cared much about practical application.
</p>

<p>
	The less practical a thing is, the more universal it can be. There is a trade off here. Being practical is not as great as it seems.

<p>
	Democracy is increasing -- this is a general long-term global trend. This becomes a problem if consciousness and education does not keep pace. It's analogous to the problem of when technology increases but consciousness does not. Democracy redistributes power into the hands of the many, but if the many are ignorant, this leads to disaster. Which is why democracy did not exist for most of human history.
</p>

<p>
	What people don't understand is that democracy did not exist because it couldn't exist -- because people were too dumb to govern themselves. You cannot have democracy in Syria because the people are too ignorant to handle it. They need a brutal dictator to keep them in line through raw force because a dumb person doesn't understand things other than raw force.
</p>

<p>
	To have nice things requires first curing your ignorance. Which requires a robust education system.
</p>

<p>
	It actually makes them more rigid, since they are steeling themselves against a communist takeover.
</p>

<p>
	This is modern conservatives in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
	It's very problematic when you have 10% of the population who is very high in development but 90% which is still stuck in Blue/Orange. It creates a civil war -like situation because the value sets are so different and the ones in power tend to usually be from the upper 10%.
</p>

<p>
	Dumb and selfish people are not content to be governed by wise and selfless people. Dumb people expect the freedom to act out their stupidity.

	Psychedelics are not going to reliably raise your baseline level of consciousness. You can't live in a never-ending psychedelic high.

<p>
	A) You have to remember that most Nazi's are not putting babies heads on pikes or burning Jews in ovens. Your typical 1930's Nazi was basically like today's Neoliberal corpo professional class. The pop-cultural image of Nazis as these evil murderers is not true to how Nazis actually were. Your typical 1930's Nazi was like your grandma who would bake you cookies.
</p>

<p>
	Need I remind you guys that Ramaji and Ananda were/are Trump supporters? There's your enlightened Nazis of the 21st century <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	All that Nazi really means is nationalism/stage Blue. And you can certainly be enlightened at stage Blue. Most of Japanese Zen masters are like that.
</p>

<p>
	B) The binary label of "enlightened" in this case is very problematic because again it removes the many degrees and facets of consciousness which are possible and are highly important. When you use the word "enlightened" in such a binary and simplistic manner it leads to all sorts of absurdities. The bottom line is that being "enlightened" doesn't mean as much as you think it means. It's a very low bar to clear. The mistake here is that people hear that someone is "enlightened" and then they automatically assume that this equates to perfection and sainthood. Not. At. All.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if we called all boxers "boxers" without any further distinctions in the quality of their boxing. So a kid at your local gym is a "boxer" and Mike Tyson is a "boxer". So they are equal. That's how absurd this "enlightened" label is.
</p>

<p>
	Or imagine if we called everyone who went to school as "educated". So your kid who finished 5th grade is "educated" and Albert Einstein is also "educated".
</p>

<p>
	That's good to know.
</p>

<p>
	But I'll probably do the detox anyway since I do it regularly anyways, just to be on the safe side. There's no harm from the detox and it's easy to do once you get the hang of it.
</p>

<p>
	And remember, by the time most of us get a vaccine there will probably be 6 different vaccines in circulation and you won't be able to predict which one you get. You will be lucky to get any at all.

<p>
	That's already a bias. For me, understanding is its own end. It does not need to have any practical value. Although of course often it does have a practical value, but I don't really care whether it does or doesn't.
</p>

<p>
	To me understanding is like art. I enjoy it and I don't need a utilitarian justification for participating in it.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	All human advancement is predicated on correct understanding of a thing.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is no formula for not getting lost. You must remain forever conscious and flexible.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, growth for the sake of growth becomes just another tail-chasing activity. There is no end to growth and devoting your entire life to maximizing growth is really not a good attitude because you'll be running like a hamster in a wheel until you die. Chasing growth is not much different than chasing money or women.
</p>

<p>
	Grow as much as you feel you need to in order to be satisfied and enjoy life.
</p>

<p>
	For me, what I enjoy is understanding reality. I don't do it to get something out of it other than joy.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't care about understanding, then do whatever you care about.

<p>
	The thing is, as much as enlightened folk poo-poo conceptual understanding, human society is only going to become even more conceptual in the future. Avoiding concept is not a solution. The way out is through, not around.
</p>

<p>
	Humans need to learn how to use their minds properly. And that's where I come in. Telling people not to use their minds is not a solution to our problems.

<p>
	Of course culture has been controlled by elites and intellectuals in many ways for a long tine. But as democracy increases this will become less true. Stupidity will be more represented, as we have been seeing in the last 5 years.
</p>

<p>
	The days when elites fed you ideology from the top is starting to give way to grass roots ideology from the bottom up.
</p>

<p>
	And there is backlash. 10% is really flimsy. The other 90% will be unconscious and rebel and demonize those 10% even if the 10% are good and true.
</p>

<p>
	Also we are very far from 10% wise Tier 2 people. I think all the Spiral percentages are over-inflated.
</p>

<p>
	Less than 1% is Yellow, realistically speaking.
</p>

	That's what happens when you get stuck in ideology and don't bother to think deeply about epistemology.

			Could it be that conceptual understanding can never be utterly complete/concluded as the creative nature of conceptualization will always create new distinctions and thus more that can be conceptually understood or considered? Could truly realizing the bottomless nature of the activity allow one to slow down the desire for/pursuit of more of the same, leading by default to greater embodiment/Being rather than feeling that embodiment will arise when "I just get this last bit figured out"?

<p>
	How can such a thing be quantified?
</p>

<p>
	I certainly have a lot deeper to go with my embodiment.
</p>

<p>
	You have to keep in mind though that my primary focus is on understanding, not necessarily embodiment. You can understand far more than you will ever be able to embody in one lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	To me, conceptual understanding is not some dirty word. It's the bulk of my life's work.

<p>
	You expect a lot for nothing. Good luck with that.
</p>

<p>
	That kinda thing is what coach training programs are for.
</p>

<p>
	Coach training for someone who's in high school or college is not really appropriate. People that young lack the wisdom and life experience to coach others. Of course you can learn coaching at any age, but it's gonna be hard to get people to take you seriously.

			so then.. is it really wise to continue pushing If I'm driven by fear? Isn't that repeating the same fear pattern? Shouldn't I just let myself a brake and not be so neurotic about me having to do this? At the same time if I'm scared I'll repeat the fear pattern ain't I then by default repeating the fear pattern? soo, what's the paradox? What's the nuance I'm missing?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, I know it is difficult.
</p>

<p>
	But what would you do if you were acting from consciousness, love, and no fear?
</p>

<p>
	Personally I've invested several years just letting go and pushing less. It cost me a lot of productivity and money, but that's the cost of learning new ways of living life.
</p>

<p>
	Pushing constantly, mechanically, might have gotten you here. But what got you here will not get you to the ultimate stage. You must learn to do things in new, more holistic ways. Neurotic habits must be surrendered. This is "the work".
</p>

<p>
	You cannot just go through life like a mule. Stage Blue tends to be mule-like and there is a price to pay for that.
</p>

<p>
	Life requires requisite variety. See my blog video about requisite variety.

<p>
	Society has survived just fine unconsciously for the last 10,000 years. It ain't going anywhere. There is nothing at all special about our century. This is how society is. This is business as usual. Chaos isn't some special condition. Chaos is the norm. It has always been and it will always be. So get used to it and stop crying Chicken Little the sky is falling. Haven't you noticed yet that every generation screams the sky is falling? These cries are just the self-importance of ego.
</p>

<p>
	You ain't so important that society's survival hinges on you. Even if half of us die, society will go on just fine without us.

<p>
	In that case you gotta do your work more consciously, balancing it out with self-love, authenticity, and time for rest and contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	Working like a robot is not enough. You must work CONSCIOUSLY. Stage Blue falls into the trap of being disciplined in an unconscious and mechanical way without pausing for deep self-reflection. Blue tends to work hard but not wise.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you're falling into the trap of being a robot and not doing the kind of work that your heart calls you to do.
</p>

<p>
	Make a distinction between mechanical work for the purpose of survival and material gain vs conscious work for a higher life purpose. When you start to follow your heart and LP, you might find that your work output decreases as you slow down and dive deep into exploring yourself. When you do this you're building up your root system that will enable much deeper work in the future but at the cost of less output in the short-term.
</p>

<p>
	Balancing all this out is tricky. It's easy to fool yourself and fall into on extreme or another.

	I'm sure there's good insights in those books, but be careful not to get too carried away with the progressive worldview.
</p>

<p>
	It's very easy to find flaws with society. It's much harder to design workable and realistic solutions that solve those problems without creating even bigger problems.

	What I say fundamentally aligns with all mystical and spiritual traditions and teachings. It's just a question of breadth and depth of understanding. I know the Nothingness/Emptiness of which these Advaita and Zen teachers speak. But there's more beyond that.

<p>
	Your consciousness is the final arbiter of everything. Find out for yourself what is the case. I'm just pointing out things that you might otherwise overlook.

<p>
	Most teachers come from traditions such as Zen, Buddhism, or Advaita -- all of which they never question. These traditions guide students towards pure emptiness. When a student hits this pure emptiness, he assumes that's the end of the road, when really, it's just the end of the road for the methods he was using. But by this point he's so steeped in nondual dogma that he has no desire to even try new methods because he assumes emptiness is all there is.
</p>

<p>
	This is why people can be "enlightened" but still not be conscious of what God or Love is. To realize what God is it is not enough to fall into emptiness, you must raise your consciousness to a high holistic level to grasp the entire dynamic of the imagined dream. It's not enough to just extinguish the mind, the mind must become Infinite -- at which point you will have infinite self-understanding.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Don't take psychedelic advice from people who have not done lots of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	There are certainly degrees of awareness and consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	This confusion happens with spiritual teachers because they mistake pure empty consciousness with states of higher holistic God-consciousness. These are different things. If your only focus is pure empty consciousness, then yes, that has no degrees or qualities to it. But that's a bias and it's not the highest form of consciousness, it's the lowest.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, you can strive for the lowest possible level or the highest. Zen and Advaita strive for the lowest. Which is fine, but it's only half the game. Just because you've reached the lowest level: zero, does not mean you've reached the highest levels of Infinite Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	What people like Spira are guiding you towards is the lowest level. And what I'm guiding you to is the highest. Hence there is a disparity and confusion. The problem is that this distinction is not made clear to students and teachers love to dismiss the higher levels because they love to reduce everything to the lowest. It's a form of spiritual reductionism. People like Ralston fall into this trap.
</p>

<p>
	When your only method is something like self-inquiry or meditation, you end up reducing everything down to pure emptiness. Which is not the same thing as Infinite Consciousness or God-consciousness. The problem is that self-inquiry is not enough to get you to Infinite Consciousness. It gets you to emptiness, which is nice, but not the end-all.
</p>

<p>
	And psychedelics can get you to emptiness too. So his characterization of psychedelics are merely expanding the range of experience is simply false. Psychedelics will do both. They will expand range but also make you conscious of emptiness and the groundless ground.
</p>

<p>
	As it goes mainstream it will turn into stupidity and evil. This has all happened before.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that will lead to a mass awakening is a techological breakthrough more radical than 5-MeO-DMT. Some scientific way to change our DNA or brains to make people more conscious by default. It will not happen through meditation or yoga or education alone.

			Many spiritual teachers talk about a mass awakening happening right now that will accelerate in the decade to come. Some say it comes in part from a shift in energies on the planet.

<p>

	You sure feel important when you visit Shunya's ashram and pretend like you are saving the world by meditating. But you are not saving anyone but yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The world has been in chaos for 10,000 years and that's not about to change. There is nothing special about today's chaos.

<p>
	That IS the love of truth. That is the desire for truth.
</p>

<p>
	You just need to cultivate and feed that impulse like stoking a coal into a roaring fire.
</p>

<p>
	Love of truth is a bitter-sweet thing. Don't expect it be like candy. Truth requires a mature palate. You can develop your palate by pursuing truth gradually until you come to appreciate it more and more.

<p>
	Obviously there will be chaos to reach a higher level of development and consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	No one is disputing that.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is when you drill it into your students' minds that civilization is collapsing. Civilization is not collapsing, it's just evolving.
</p>

<p>
	What he says in the above video is exactly correct. The only thing is, there will not be any mass awakening soon. 100 years from now people will still largely be as unconscious and undeveloped as they are today. Our situation is far deeper than some guru's YT videos can fix in one generation. It will take 100s of years to move a significant number of people up to the levels of consciousness he is talking about. It will not happen in your childrens' lifetime.

<p>
	It's better to remove it than to live with it for 60 years. But you need to find a dentist experienced in heavy metal extraction otherwise a normal dentist will leak that mercury all into your mouth.

<p>
	Dressing sharp, fitted, with style and grooming well is important.
</p>

<p>
	But by itself it will not get you laid. And you can get laid without it.
</p>

<p>
	Go to a tailor and get all your clothes fitted. Buy new clothes that have some kind of matching style. Hire an image consultant if you can't figure out your style yourself. You need at least one set of sharp jeans, sharp dress shirt, sharp shoes, and they all have to fit together well and fit your body perfectly. Groom your hair and facial hair so that it looks sharp.

			Is it not amazing how sneaky fear truly is? It will find it's way into the mind of even the most conscious individuals. In the conscious mind, fear will morph into confidence and certainty, so subtly, so invisibly, that the conscious mind will not even have noticed it happen at all. Fear is like a great chameleon. If you do not come to respect fear, you shall be it's slave. Your mind shall close and your eyes blinded with visions which you will confuse for reality.
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			Shunyamurti is an excellent fascilitator of this chameleon of fear. He himself has become a vassal of that chameleon. Can you see how powerful this chameleon is? Can you see it's ingenious survival tactics? It truly is awe-inspiring. A foe so sophisticated that once you underestimate, once you believe to have defeated, will strike you so fast that you will not ever know that it has injected it's poison into your flesh.
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			Ironically, the more conscious a person becomes, the harder it has to look out for fear, because the more sophisticated methodes fear will develop to remain alive. The fear within a conscious person is a far greater opponent than the fear of the unconscious person. The fear in a unconscious person is a lion, the fear in the conscious person is a fog. No sword can harm it, no shield can protect you from it's invasion.
		</p>

		<p>
			If this is not understood, the conscious person will fall pray to the fog just as much as the unconscious person falls pray to the lion.
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>If you believe to have freed yourself from fear, always, always, always assume that fear has shifted into a form you have not yet learned to recognize. This shall be true until your mind has dissolved completely and your body is being eaten by maggots.</strong>

	Be careful not to project fear onto him.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see any fear in him from what I have seen. I disagree with his Kali Yuga teachings, but they are not fear based.

	It it not fear to say the world is ending if it actually is.

	4 billion years of fear were required to engineer your body and mind so that it can survive long enough to learn the word "love".

			HI Leo!

		</p>

		<p>
			Really appreciate your help. I will do this and focus on other girls meanwhile and educate myself in this topic. Question - I really want her and we connect on phone so there is a cemestry. The problem (I think) is that I have been to pushy regarding to her and when we was gonna meet I sounded a bit stressed a desperate to book this which she then said "You make me feel so stressed" so I changed subjet and said haha ok but I need to know so I can plan my days but no worries lets decide next week. And this week she avoided the question. So my strategy no (Since I have accepted that this can fail but still really want to give it a try) is to back down a bit to not be so needy and chill and just talk with her and have fund for a few days to build connection again and when I feel that the mood is good again approach this question again about when we should meet. What do you say?
		</p>

<p>
	You are needy so she will not sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	You've already lost her. Move on to other girls.

<p>
	Unfortunately not -- because there are many eager young fools waiting to take their place.
</p>

<p>
	Game studios abuse eager young developers who don't know any better.
</p>

<p>
	But also, the reality is that game development is extremely difficult. More difficult than making movies. A movie is easy to make compared to a game. It's extremely easy to fall into the trap of biting off more than your team can chew. Which is exactly what Cyberpunk did.
</p>

<p>
	Everything in game development takes longer than you imagine, even if you plan for it taking longer, it will still take longer than anything you plan. It is a minor miracle whenever a game gets published at all.

	It's not possible to be satisfied with nothing without ego death.
</p>

<p>
	The ego cannot do nothing. It needs to be constantly surviving.

<p>
	You can gradually detox yourself from stimulation tho. But it won't feel good.

<p>
	It's not a matter of ideology. All these ideas would need to be tested at small scale to see which of them work. Some may not work. Or they may work at low percentages. We need to test what the right percentages are.
</p>

<p>
	For example, we need to test what the best corporate tax rate is. That number should be scientifically derived, not ideology derived.

<p>
	Take a look at the cash reserves of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and such companies. Tens of billions in cash, not doing much. I propose most of that go to its employees who will actually spend it.

	Right now capitalists and investor class is hoarding most of the world's wealth and using it to milk the working class dry.

<p>
	I use OneNote 2010, which is completely locally stored.
</p>

<p>
	For most people cloud storage is probably good enough. I like local storage because I'm a control freak. Unless you're a power-user or a control freak, cloud storage should meet all your needs. And it is technically more reliable.

<p>
	But in my system your life savings cannot be invested in stock. That's the whole point! You would have stock, but the stock by itself would be worthless unless you're working in the company. All the stock does is pay you dividends as long as you work there. Your true worth would not be in stocks but in cash savings from years of work.
</p>

<p>
	This would effectively eliminate the stock market and its crashes. People will no longer be allowed to speculate on stocks. All the speculator sharks will have to go out and get a real job. Which will put more money in the hands of loyal workers.

<p>
	I generally agree.
</p>

<p>
	Although a public option might be undermined by the American insurance cartel.
</p>

<p>
	It's tricky because if you compromise too much you end up with a system so bad that people hate it.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, nothing gets done without some compromise. The compromises have be strategic.

They have so much power they will try to dismantle and undo any public option.
</p>

<p>
	The American medical cartel is much worse than in any other country.
</p>

<p>
	There is simply no purpose for private insurance companies. It's a total scam. Insurance is the perfect function for government. Government already insures the most essential things. The insurance industry is basically a bunch of grifting middlemen screwing people over to make ridiculous margins for a commodity service. Insurance is as bad as loansharking.
</p>

<p>
	Government can easily create a monopoly on auto insurance, house insurance, disaster insurance, life insurance, health insurance. It would be a huge savings for people.

<p>
	You will earn a lot more under my system because during your entire lifetime of work you will be getting dividends from the company you work for. By being an employee you will automatically be vested in the stock market. So you won't need a 401k. All you'll need is a savings account to hold your earnings.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if every Walmart employee -- even the cashiers and janitors -- earned dividends for every year they worked at Walmart. That would be a just system and they would be a lot richer. Working at Walmart would be a lot more enjoyable.

<p>
	It would not be a blanket ban. It would be gradually phased in over decades and you wouldn't lose all of your stock, maybe some percentage. This percentage could phase in.
</p>

<p>
	We could start with simple law that gives 5% of your stock to your replacement if you leave your company. Nothing would collapse this way. This would encourage managers and executives to actually care about the long-term success of their companies.

<p>
	Yeah, it's radical. Some kind of alternative to Wall Street needs to be invented.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is to break up the consolidation of capital in the hands of a few elites. There need to be systems and laws that push capital downward to average people. One such principle might be that if you leave the company, you lose most of your stock to the guy who replaces you, and holding stock pays automatic dividends if your company makes profit, but only if you work within the company. As soon as you leave, the guy who takes your position gets it.
</p>

<p>
	Passive sources of income need to be gradually eliminated. All passive income comes off the back of wage slaves.

Then it would have been a 9 or 10 out of 10 and sold 40 million copies.

Could you please answer:  does this advice apply to all girls? What about shy serious cold kind of girls? There are some girls which are super open to serious deep conversations but its hard af to get them to be playful and do small talk. When i mean serious deep conversations i am not saying no humor or teasing at all. Just you guys talk about a specific topic rather than changing topics every 20 seconds with 0 meaning or substance like you do during small talk.
		</p>

		<p>
			Really curious about this, what do you think
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Every girl loves humor and charm. There's no such thing as a serous cold girl. She's being that way because you got bad game or she's just not interested in you.
</p>

<p>
	Of course not all girls will be interested in you, in which case you just move on to the next girl.
</p>

<p>
	Attracting girls requires reaching a "hook point" where you can clearly see that she's attracted to you. Hook point is usually reached within 1-5 minutes. If the hook point never comes, then move other girls. Don't waste your time trying to get girls who can't reach hook point within 5-10 mins.
</p>

<p>
	Serious deep conversations can happen after sex.
</p>

<p>
	You can't get any particular girl. Change your strategy to getting girls in general, not one specific girl.
</p>

<p>
	If she's difficult, go talk to 10 other girls and the problem will solve itself.

<p>
	Many problems with capitalism could simply be fixed by passing a few rock solid laws.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		No ownership of stock without being employed by the company
	</li>
	<li>
		No corporate lobbying
	</li>
	<li>
		No corporate political contributions
	</li>
	<li>
		No buying of other big corporations by big corporations
	</li>
	<li>
		Salary caps for executives and management
	</li>
	<li>
		No arbitration clauses in contracts
	</li>
	<li>
		No criminal liability protections for executives
	</li>
	<li>
		No off-shore tax havens and corp tax loopholes
	</li>
	<li>
		All employees get representation on corporate board
	</li>
	<li>
		All employees get profit sharing
	</li>
	<li>
		Higher taxes on successful wealthy corporations
	</li>
	<li>
		Strict environmental regulations
	</li>
	<li>
		Severe fines for corporate fraud or mismanagement
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Simple laws like that, when rigorously enforced, would fix many problems.
</p>

<p>
	These laws are not that difficult to make work. It's just almost impossible to pass them in Congress.
</p>

	Remember, capitalism is not just gonna go away. Whatever comes after it will build on top of it. The foundations of capitalism are too successful to ever completely go away. They will just evolve.
</p>

<p>
	Modern society is far too dependent on giant corporations today to get rid of them. So you need to find ways to run giant corporations in more democratic and equitable ways. But you can't eliminate them.

	I'm inclined to say civilization IS guaranteed. But its quality is not guaranteed. A few nukes are not gonna kill civilization. Civilization is much more robust than people think. Even a massive nuclear war would not end it, just set it back.
</p>

<p>
	In the grand scheme of things the only thing that could end civilization is a large meteor strike or some massive freak natural event like a super-volcano or burst of solar radiation. Anything less than that will cause lots of suffering but not end civilization.
</p>

<p>
	The real question is how to reduce human suffering and how to elevate human consciousness in better way.

	They are good, just limited and partial. Stage Green politics can only take us so far. And from the perspective of truth, their worldview is not very truthful. And truth is mostly what I'm concerned about. But it's still better than right-wing worldviews and centrist worldviews.
</p>

<p>
	I look at things from a much higher perspective than most people care about. This comes with its pros and cons. The higher the perspective the less practical it can seem.

	It's amazing how good Morrowind looks today with full mod support. It's held up really well thanks to mods.
</p>

<p>
	I wish they'd hire a studio to do a full HD remaster with better combat improvements from Skyrim and larger dungeons.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of great games of yor need modern day remasters. Like Diablo 2.

<p>
	They developed such an awesome combat system but they barely give you enough enemies in the whole game to playtest it all. They needed to have way less story and puzzles and like 5x more enemy encounters. Then that game would be a 10/10 for me.
</p>

<p>
	I hate it when devs waste half their resources on story and puzzles that are not fun.

	The Divinity games are excellent, but they really screw up the last third of their games and they don't have enough enemies to fight. It's a shame. Too many dumb puzzles and not enough combat.

			FromSoft is my favorite game studio and one of primary inspirations for pursuing game development, so I couldn't help but grin at this. Sekiro might also be up your alley if you're in to the Souls series, and the Tokugawa era Japan setting was a nice change of pace for the studio. I might also recommend the Book of the New Sun series if the setting and mood of Dark Souls appeals to you, and if you're not put off by dense literary works.

			pretty accurate characterization of what's going on. thing is this is kinda an old unspoken agreement between gamers/devs that these big role playing games are going to launch broken as hell and then over time will be patched and completed. this agreement will go so far as to basically include one of the versions being totally unplayable but it's sold anyway and gamers are warned not to buy it. this is how it was with those bethesda fallout games and oblivion/skyrim. the playstation version was unplayable and it was basically your own fault if you decided to buy it. thing is though this was almost ten years ago and I think this won't fly today. especially for a game that was hyped up so much that it entered mainstream discussion and probably was the biggest game to drop since GTA V. times have changed. if you sell something it has to work. the cyberpunk situation is actually getting mainstream news coverage.  
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Every dev should have learned their lesson fron Fallout 76. But they didn't.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest facepalm here with Cyberpunk is that there zero need to rush the release. They would have sold even more units if they released it in 6 months. And their dev costs would have been no bigger. As it is now, CDPR will still be doing dev on this game for 6 full months into the summer. So they gained nothing but bad PR here and lost sales. Their investors were not even pressuring them to release. So this is just terrible executive biz strategy on their part.
</p>

<p>
	If they delayed this game another year, nothing bad would happen.

			What was wrong with Skyrim? I actually liked it much more than Oblivion and Morrowind. They took advantage of modern graphic software and engines to combine the beauty of Oblivion with the great gameplay of Morrowind. But yah curious about the next thing, unless Tod Howard decides to milk fallout series with another crappy multiplayer.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I enjoyed Skyrim a lot, but it just don't feel as good or deep of a world as Morrowind. It just doesn't have the same replayability and alien vibe.
</p>

<p>
	The mechanics and graphics and dungeons of Skyrim are great, but that magic of Morrowind is missing.
</p>

<p>
	And those fucking dragons! I will take cliffracers any day of the week.

	Yes, I have a book about Japanese monks in my book list. Do a CTRL+F search for the term "monks" and you'll see it.

		</p>

		<p>
			If life is a dream or an illusion, does physical reality exist or not? Is it just a projection of the ego mind or a projection of God's mind since this is "God's Dream"? Physical reality is and exists within' consciousness after all, right?
		</p>

		<p>
			When you say life is what Nothing looks like and feels like, then that implies physical reality exists?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not as a static objective thing.
</p>

<p>
	Physical reality exists in the same way that your dream realities exist. They exist when you are dreaming them.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to a movie. In a movie all that exist is what's visible in the current frame. There's no world behind the frame.

<p>
	Nothing applies to formless states of consciousness equally well as to formed states of consciousness.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I know what you're saying. Yes.
</p>

<p>
	What exists in that case is emptiness plus the idea of a non-existent apple.
</p>

<p>
	The key is to realize that non-existence is an idea, not an actual thing. Non-existence is imaginary. Consciousness is dreaming up non-existence!
</p>

<p>
	See, if God is the creator of everything, then God must also be the creator of non-existence. And so it is! If God wants non-existence he first has to dream it up. Don't just assume that non-existence exists by default. It doesn't! The default is Oneness, not twoness. And non-existence is twoness, since it's in duality with existence.

<p>
	Of course it's holonic. Which is why simplistic, one-sided political ideologies will never work. You need a complex, holistic, systems approach at the least.
</p>

<p>
	This is why I dislike Youtube progressives and Marxists. Their worldview is not holistic or integral enough to be true. And so it will keep failing.

I’m a keen gamer and just getting into this awakening path. As a result, I’m limiting my gaming somewhat - but am curious as to whether your awakening process has meant you’ve eliminated the activity entirely or do you still make time to play now & again?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't play nearly as much as in my early 20's. But I will make time to play once in a while if something great comes out.
</p>

<p>
	I have very high standards so rarely does something come out that I consider worth playing these days.
</p>

<p>
	But if a new Souls game comes out, I will beat it like a rented mule.
</p>

<p>
	You should cut back your gaming though if you're serious about awakening work. Only play the best stuff. Don't play average shit. Invest that time in awakening.
</p>

<p>
	No. A unicorn exists as a concept.
</p>

<p>
	But if you mean that thing the concept "unicorn" is supposed to point to, that exists as emptiness relative to planet Earth. But it could exist as a solid form because consciousness is unlimited. Just because no human has seen a unicorn doesn't mean it cannot be seen by consciousness.

<p>
	It's gotten so dumbed down and mainstream that the thing which made Elderscrolls great: Mirrowind, will never be repeated again. It's all downhill from here. Although I am looking forward to the next Elderscrolls. But I'm pretty sure they will dumb it down even more than Skyrim. Bethesda has sold its soul to the devil long ago. They don't understand what made Morrowind so special.

<p>
	The trope of women falling in love with their abusers is nothing new. Happens all the time. It's not offensive to say so. And the relationship between gamer fanboys and game publishers is almost the same dynamic on a psychological level. Fanboys love games, and game publishes know this and abuse them for it because they know the gamer is too addicted to leave.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Your intuition is correct.
</p>

<p>
	Existence has no opposite. Existence includes both something and nothing. Nothing is not non-existence. Nothing is existence.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness exists, as Nothing. Your entire life experience has been an experience of Nothing. Life is what Nothing looks like and feels like. The key mistake you've made is that you've assumed that life is not nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Life = Nothing. The end.
</p>

<p>
	What humans call "non-existence" is actually pure existence as emptiness. A non-existent object is simply the existence of emptiness. It exists! As emptiness. But you have confused this for non-existence.
</p>

<p>
	When your dog dies, it continues to exist. As emptiness. All that happens in death is the loss of form and a return to existence as emptiness. Nothing is ever really lost.

	Meh... Witcher 3 is way overrated.
</p>

<p>
	CDPR was way overrated, and now reality hits. They bit off more than they could chew with this game.
</p>

<p>
	Gamers are so gullible and easy to exploit. Just give a game a Bladerunner theme and Keanu Reeves, and you sell 8 million units overnight regardless of substance.
</p>

<p>
	And like an abused girl, gamers will eagerly come back for more abuse in 8 years. And so will the absued developers. They too will come back for more crunch. And so the industry churns on.

	If they reach that point, they've already screwed up badly. We don't just ban people willy-nilly here. To get banned usually requires many offenses or a single very serious offense.

<p>
	Sorry, but my time is limited and I'm not going to bend over backwards for people who get banned.

<p>
	In all my years banning people, I have never seen a single banned person who was willing to correct their behavior. Not one. Even if they are willing, they are simply constitutionally incapable of it and I am not going to wait around for them to grow up.

	I keep a close eye on Mods to make sure they are well-behaved. And for the most part we have an excellent Mod team here that requires little guidance from me.
</p>

<p>
	If a Mod repeatedly makes mistakes and shows poor judgment they will lose Mod status (which has happened once or twice in the past). I'm generally very careful about selecting Mods to begin with, so it really don't get much better than this. Don't forget, Mods are human. They will never be perfect. I'm not perfect either. Policing this forum is a lot of work and policing will always involve an element of subjectivity.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a problem with Mod behavior you can always contact me about it. But if you do, you better present a solid case with solid evidence of abuse. Just because a Mod issued you a warning you disagree with does not mean the Mod is abusing their power.
</p>

<p>
	This forum would be a hell-hole without all the work our Mods do (for free).
