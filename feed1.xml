<p>
	There is nothing outside of imagination.

<p>
	If you think something is not imaginary -- that's you imagining it.

<title>How to ask less questions and start talking more?</title>

<p>
	You need to practice talking more about yourself and what interests you. Push your personality out onto others. Share yourself. This takes courage and practice. Probably you feel deep down that you will be rejected or that people are not interested in what you have to say. This boils down to a low self-esteem issue.

TYT is so progressive it will take 50-100 years to enact all their ideals. The bottleneck lies elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
	You could choose to be happy that something like TYT even exists and that they got people like AOC elected. Learn to appreciate small victories. Progress is always happening, even under Trump.

				If we completely let go of the ego, experience ego death, let go of the identity, be totally selfless, become the whole universe, would we not than be: 0 work ethic, 0 dedication, 0 discipline, 0 perseverance, lazy beings? How can we create from that? How can we deal with resistance which shows up? How can we be true masters at anything?

<p>
	The ego-mind is making improper assumptions about what will happen once the ego is transcended.
</p>

<p>
	Laziness is part of the ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	Without ego-mind, you become a super-conductor for Infinite Intelligence. A ton of energy is freed up. You can be more productive than you've ever been as an ego. But also, there is no need to be productive. You can be just as happy going off in the forest to starve to death. Since nothing matters, you are free. And you don't need to control anything. Everything will unfold according to Infinite Intelligence. Infinite Intelligence isn't lazy. Ego is lazy. You don't even need to worry about what will happen -- there is a total surrender to the flow of the Universe.
</p>

<p>
	Resistance is 100% ego and falsehood. There is zero resistance once ego is purged.

<p>
	To be on the safe side, I'd lower your starting dose to 1g.
</p>

<p>
	Better to start low and go higher later than overshoot.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea what you're getting yourself into with psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need any books. Throw them away and focus on direct experience.

<p>
	Stage Blue people are incapable of appreciating multiculturalism and they are incapable of secular government. So there will be cultural and ethnic battle until they evolve to Orange and above. Until then there will basically be nationalism if not something worse, like ethnic cleansing or concentration camps. It will probably take India and Pakistan another 100-200 years to evolve out of Blue and leave behind their childish ethnic identities.

<p>
	Nothing is wrong with anything.
</p>

<p>
	It's just not a means of you reaching Truth. If you're looking for a public debate to reveal some deep truth to you, you're not getting what this work entails. The real work is completely internal. You should not expect anyone to prove or explain anything to you. Turn inward. Turn to direct experience.

<p>
	I have less and less patience for people on this forum talking shit they clearly do not understand. Either have enough wisdom to listen to those who know more than you, or find some other place on the internet to BS. It's not gonna fly here.

<p>
	"How could I survive?" is a totally deluded question.
</p>

<p>
	That is ego asking from fear. A rock does not ask such a question.
</p>

<p>
	The beauty is, after awakening, you would have no problem just starving to death. It wouldn't matter at all.

<title>Groundedness Over Enlightenment?</title>

<p>
	The ego cannot have emotional groundedness because all of it is false.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing there is to ground into is Truth, which the opposite of the you who wants control.
</p>

<p>
	For a calm attitude, you must die.

	To some extent, probably.

<p>

<p>
	TYT is a much bigger organization than all those one-man YouTubers. TYT has like 50+ employees. A lot of mouths to feed. As they grow they will become more corporate.
</p>

<p>
	All of these issues are far too deep to be avoided through some simplistic approach like "Corporations are evil." The devil cannot be cast out so easily precisely because the devil is you. Survival forces all of us to sell out to some extent.

<p>
	What you have to understand is that if you are going to change the system in a big way you are going to have to Aikido the system's energy against itself. And of course as you co-opt the system, it will also co-opt you.
</p>

<p>
	Using money to combat money in politics isn't hypocrisy per se, it's a necessity.
</p>

<p>
	TYT is playing a game of survival, just like everyone else, just like corporations, religions, politicians, you, and me. This means chasing money to some extent.
</p>

<p>
	You shouldn't be too purist about these things because politics and survival are not a purist sport. If you want purity, become a monk and forget all about politics. Politics is pure survival. So it's gonna be dirty.

<p>
	Yes, ego was terrified because the trip was too much too fast. With plugging it's much easier.
</p>

<p>
	You also probably have plenty of shadow material to work through before you can have a full beautiful 5-MeO breakthrough.

<p>
	Giving a newbie a high dose of smoked 5-MeO is so stupid. Such a waste.
</p>

<p>
	You want the trip to be gradual and as long as possible. 4 hr trips are ideal.
</p>

<p>
	Consider something like low dose mushrooms or LSD. You will get a lot more out of it.
</p>

<p>
	People here are too preoccupied with 5-MeO. There are other psychedelics to explore which will be more beneficial for most of you. 5-MeO is for very experienced psychonauts, not newbies.

<p>
	Sadhguru is going around marketing himself. What is hard to understand about this?
</p>

<p>
	If I was invited to go on CNN and talk enlightenment, I would go. Just for the views. All interviews and debates are basically marketing gimmicks. Then again, nothing of substance would be accomplished by this.

<p>
	You have to understand that just because a candidate talks well about a thing doesn't mean it will ever get passed. Legalization of psychedelics will never pass at the national level under any candidates right now. People are not ready for it. Even if Yang wins no one will go along with him on legalizing mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is best handled at the local level.

<p>
	Depends on how you define "depression". Technically depression is a severe negative mood which lasts continuously for 3-6 months. By this definition I've never been depressed.
</p>

<p>
	But do I sometimes experience a few days of sadness or negativity or frustration with life? Of course! This is normal. And it will happen more often if you go deep into self-inquiry / meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Meaning and purpose is something you create. That's all. No big deal. You can have it and be conscious that you are creating it.
</p>

<p>
	What choice do you have? You fear death so your only option is to play the game of survival.
</p>

<p>
	If you had the balls and wisdom to face your own death, you'd transcend the illusion of birth/death and survival, and life would become effortless.
</p>

	There is no reason whatsoever to survive. You are free not to survive if you want.

		<p>
			A concept like this is making me extremely depressed. And it's not just a minimal depression. It's a <em>harsh</em> one.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's a deep suicidal depression where everything gets dark. It's like The Dark Night of the Soul.

<p>
	The ego cannot integrate this. Awakening to the Truth is required.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you're not ready for this work of awakening. You might just want to pursue success and basic personal development for now. The pursuit of awakening requires serious passion for Truth and emotional maturity. If truth is making you depressed, this work is not for you. You should be excited that life has no meaning or purpose. You should be excited that reality is an illusion. You need a LOVE for truth.

			So would you say, it is more beneficial to contemplate during a trip the question 'what is disease/sickness' rather than 'how to heal/strengthen the body'? Or do you think, that all these questions are best dealt with while asking the meta-question 'what am I'?

<p>
	The ego's delusion is to believe that one outcome is better than another. The ego is a biased perception of reality. This bias is what creates suffering. So if you want to manipulate reality your whole life, go ahead. The cost of that will be living in a self-created hell. If you want an easy and effortless life, surrender to the will of the universe and stop manipulating.
</p>

<p>
	The point of surrender is heaven and joy.
</p>

<p>
	By trying to get everything your way, you end up creating your own hell. That's the tragedy of the ego's game.
</p>

	There is no best. It depends on your style and who you resonate with. There are lots of good dating coaches and materials out there. Find which ever ones you like.

<title>Does Daygame really work?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Of course it works.
</p>

<p>
	Don't ask women if they want to be approached. No woman will ever admit that she would sleep with a guy from a cold approach because that would make her look like a slut. But she will if you attract her. Just do a quality approach.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is not a logical choice. Never ask women if they would logically date you. The answer will always be No.
</p>

<p>
	Day game is the best. The only trick is that you need a location with lots of beautiful women. That's hard to find in most cities. You need a big city. Cities like LA, NYC, and London are amazing for day game. You need a place with cafes, malls, boardwalks, beaches, busy sidewalks, college campuses, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I like day game because the approaches can be a lot more genuine and natural. And there's zero competition.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The problem here is with the overly-simplistic and binary notion of "an enlightened being". There is no such thing. There are many degrees of awakening and many different states of consciousness and many different modes of being.
</p>

<p>
	Most so-called awakened people still have plenty of impurities and their state of consciousness is not as high as it could be.

The difference is exactly whatever you imagine it to be. All difference is imagination itself.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between anything until you imagine there is. In this way you construct all of reality.
</p>

<p>
	The desire or need for spirits to be predictable or consistent is YOUR projected expectation, part of the scientific paradigm. Nothing says they have to fit your paradigm. They are their own paradigm.

</p>

<p>
	You can get all the technical details right and still come up totally wrong. Or you can get the big picture right and screw up the technical details.
</p>

<p>
	Chopra has the big picture right. And that's what needs to be understood.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe he is doing a disservice to science, but science is doing a disservice to God, which is the far greater sin. Science basically understands nothing about consciousness, so to act as though science is this great thing which is being maligned is a joke. Science itself is the malignment of intelligence and Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The hunter is the prey here. Sam Harris would not stand a chance in a serious discussion of nonduality.

<p>
	The problem is that voters don't vote based on policy, they vote based on their own Spiral stage and cultural issues.
</p>

<p>
	The right wing is great at exploiting those cultural issues which trigger a fear for the higher Spiral stages and make people vote for lower stages.
</p>

<p>
	That is Fox News' entire playbook.

</p>

<p>
	Look, psychedelics are not gonna do all the work for ya. Start doing Kriya yoga every day and you should build up a natural psychedelic in your body.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is best practiced alone. You don't really need anyone else doing it with you. Just get serious about yoga and do occassional trips out of country for psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you aren't far from the most spiritual country in the world: India. Lots of gurus and ashrams there. You could travel there and get shaktipat from a guru.
</p>

<p>
	China also has many unbanned research chemicals for sale which are even better than classic psychedelics. Do your research. It only seems like China cracks down on drugs when actually they make so many research chems.

<p>
	No, not necessarily. God is in charge and some diseases are part of its larger plan. Just because the ego wants a disease cured doesn't mean it will happen. Awakening requires surrender to the higher will of the universe. This higher will might require you to die in a car crash, or whatever.

			Except pulling Prana up and down the spine is not Kriya... You can do this practice, yes. But it is not the Kriya taught by Lahiri Mahasaya. And no, the techniques are not "simple". If they were, then there wouldn't be all the confusion, lack of progress, and negative side effects that are so common on this forum. Talking down to people and trying to invalidate their concerns, questions, and issues does not fix anything, and is actually quite harmful, imo.

<p>
	It is the Kriya Yoganada taught and which works for many people. You are mudding the waters.
</p>

<p>
	There are hundreds of different yogic systems. So to claim one true one is silly. Pick a system and go with it, rather than debating about which is the true one. There is no true one. They are all imaginary inventions of the mind, with various pros and cons. You can invent your own yoga if you want, just as all yogas have been invented by someone before you.

You're just speaking from the perspective of the Absolute while I was speaking from the relative.
</p>

<p>
	The relative perspective is important functionally, from the POV of survival. A society cannot be built if you regard outcomes like Stalin as of equal value as that of the Buddha. Even though of course in the absolute sense they are of equal value.
</p>

<p>
	I have discussed all of this before. You're conflating relative and absolute domains.
</p>

<p>
	There is no need to convince me of your paradigm. All paradigms and formulations of the Absolute are partial and relative. If you like your paradigm, fine. But convincing me of it a waste of time.

The most popular politician in the US is Bernie Sanders, who could've won the presidency in 2016 were it not for the DNC rigging. Among young people, he and other progressives like AOC are the most popular by far.

<p>
	But young people hardly vote, so they matter less.
</p>

<p>
	The most famous people are some of the dumbest members of our species. Of course there a few exceptions. But the most wise are almost never popular or even known about.
</p>

<p>
	The wisest person in the world will never be as popular as Trump or Kim Kardashian. Because popularity requires appealing to a herd of idiots. It's much easier to impress 10 million idiots than 10 million serious intellectuals.

	True freedom is the last thing the ego-mind wants.
</p>

<p>
	Freedom = death
</p>

<p>
	So just keep that in mind when you ask for maximimum freedom. You just might get it.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is all about limitation.

<p>
	Yes, of course. Even Trump and Stalin are very intelligent things. Their ego just gets in the way of access to God's infinite intelligence. But never totally. Even the most evil humans still use God's intelligence to do their evil. In fact, evil is highly intelligent. But nowhere near as intelligent as Goodness and Love.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That can be tricky. Depends on what exactly you mean.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to ground the ego or its sense of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is like jumping out of an airplane with no parachute only to realize that there is no ground. Then your life is a constant free fall for eternity.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind will do everything possible to stay grounded in the false ground of "reality". To seriously awaken this ground must be completely unraveled. You must realize that reality has no ground. Of course that ultimately will leave you right in the NOW. But first the entire ego-mind and sense of reality must collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire sense of what reality is must be unraveled and deconstructed.
</p>

	Way too much confusion in this thread. Just do the practices. They are so simple.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're being asked to read a book on how to tie your shoelaces and then spend 90% of your time debating and doubting the simple instructions.
</p>

<p>
	Pull prana up the spine, then down. Do this over and over again. The end. The rest is minutia.

<p>
	It's just intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Intelligence must be contextual, otherwise it's not very intelligent.
</p>

<p>
	Intelligence is a universal property of consciousness which can range from 0 to infinity and everything in between. Infinite Intelligence is the universe's total and complete self-understanding. Which is a real thing.

	There isn't a safe way. Safety is a concern of the ego-mind. You must surrender to the possibility of the worst happening.

			<strong>Darkness</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			I was lying on a couch looking at the ceiling. Suddenly the ceiling turned into a dark moving substance, that seemed to move towards me. This is where the trip gets a bit creepy. I saw that a black tube is attached to my body going up to the dark substance. My first ‘thought’ was, that this is some kind of a spirit attack, because it felt like the dark substance is sucking energy out of my body. My second ‘thought’ was, that this dark spirit/being is stealing my energy and causing my disease. Strangely I felt rather strong in that situation and commanded the darkness to leave. A second later I was amazed that the dark substance actually withdrew.
		</p>

			A few moments after the withdrawal I had the epiphany, that what I saw and felt wasn’t some kind of an attack, but rather a prenatal memory: me in the womb of my mother. However as far as I can remember I had also some ‘insights’ about my ancestors being haunted by dark spirits. Unfortunately I can’t remember a lot I experienced in this part of the trip – or maybe I just repressed it.

<p>
	Your entire life and reality is imaginary and how you understand any part of life is itself an act of imagination which uses symbols and metaphors and other such functions of consciousness. So when such things happen during trips what you should notice is that these are just various ways that consciousness is imagining and communicating with itself.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you could picture that you have a disease by imagining that there is a problem with your DNA. Or you could picture that you have a disease because there is an evil spirit lurking in your body. Neither one is more "real" than the other because everything is imaginary. It doesn't really matter whether you imagine DNA or evil spirits. It's all imaginary!
</p>

<p>
	If you say, "But Leo, DNA is scientific and not as imaginary as evil spirits." You're wrong. Science is as imaginary as evil spirits. The only difference is that you imagine science is "real" and you imagine that evil spirits are somehow unreal. So there's multiple layers of imagination at work which create the illusion of reality.
</p>

<p>
	What you need to realize is that all ways of holding reality are totally relative. There is no one true right way to hold reality. All communication is relative. How you communicate with yourself depends on which symbolic paradigm you want to use: scientific, religious, mathematical, etc. It doesn't really matter what the paradigm is as long as it's internally consistent.
</p>

	Hehe.... Well, you're in luck. Because self-government is exactly what all government is.
</p>

<p>
	You just aren't understanding the scope of the challenge of organizing 100 million people. You ain't gonna do that in the back of a coffee shop on back of a paper napkin.
</p>

<p>
	When a corporate band comes to take your house with tanks, helicopters, and mercenaries, you'll quickly yell for controlling them to not being able to do that. And thus government is born.

Don't necessarily draw a connection between the two. The Dems had historic wins in 2018. A Blue Wave did happen. So it could happen again.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is a buffoon of epic proportions, so this is a unique situtation in the US which should be looked at as a special case. No past performance will be indicative of what happens in 2020. We're in a whole new ballpark now. Things are very fluid.
</p>

<p>
	I think even Biden can beat Trump. Of course Biden would be a pretty depressing result. But what can you do? The country can only grow as fast as its citizens are wise. Progress is a long-term game. Bernie has already shifted the whole Dem policy platform to the left even if he loses. So overall, even with Trump in power, we are still making progress.

<p>
	This is to be expected.
</p>

<p>
	Older generations always have less progressive values. Progress is always made by the older generation dying off, not evolving. It's easier for most people to die off than evolve up two Spiral stages.
</p>

<p>
	Newer generations are always more progressive. Because it's easier to simply be born later than to grow out of your old ways.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why people under 35 overwhemlingly support Bernie while Biden's supporters are mostly over 50.

<p>
	We always have to remind ourselves, Bernie is a long-shot candidate. It assumes great wisdom on the part of the citizenry to elect Bernie. This wisdom is often lacking. Most of the citizenry is not that wise or visionary. They often would rather vote for the status quo rather than take a risk on a bold vision.
</p>

<p>
	It's not merely corporate Dems which hold Bernie back with their smears. It's that many Dems are simply not conscious enough to understand Bernie's vision. Most voters are NOT progressives. So electing a true progressive is always a difficult long-shot. It's likely that Bernie will not win the Dem nomination. But even so, it's worth a shot.

<title>What spiritual teachers say &quot;You are God&quot; ?</title>

<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	What some of you guys aren't fathoming yet is that awakening is God-realization. Nothing else. You still hold God as one thing and awakening as something else.
</p>

<p>
	When people speak of awakening or enlightenment what they really mean is:
</p>

<p>
	1) Realizing you are God.
</p>

<p>
	And...
</p>

<p>
	2) Realizing what God is.
</p>

<p>
	Of course some people haven't awoken deeply enough to understand this. There is much depth to understanding what God is.
</p>

<p>
	Do not be so naive and literal that you need a teacher to tell you the words, "You are God." They rarely state it so bluntly. Often because they know the ego will reject such a direct statement or misunderstand it.
</p>

<p>
	Be very careful with being overly literal in your reading of mystical teachings. It is a serious mistake to search the Bible for the phrase "You are God", and failing to find it, conclude that the Bible doesn't teach that you are God. Mystical teachings are not written for literal-minded rational buffoons. They are written for highly intuitive intellects which know how to connect dots.
</p>

<p>
	Intelligence and wisdom is being able to read between the lines. To understand what which cannot be made explicit.
</p>

	Yup, this is common. Enlightenment can lead to periods of loss of meaning and motivation. This is usually a phase. Many things might get dropped during this phase and facing the fear of dropping major parts of your life is part of the challenge of this work. It can be hard to navigate this.

<p>
	I have discussed, but those were private converations that I don't feel I should share publically.
</p>

<p>
	I will just say, be very careful what you assume.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Ralston was married and he has a daughter. He is a loving guy in practice, not some psychopath. So again, be careful what you assume.

Have you talked with him about that? I get the impression he didn't suffer much at all. He seems like one of those guys that live isolated getting completely obsessed with like studying a molecule for 20 years straight. It's just that his obsession happened to be consciousness.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	He is definitely hyper obsessive and focused. That's the key to his mastery, I think.
</p>

<p>
	He is self-described autistic. So that shapes how he approaches awakening. He has a dry and cold approach. This has its pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know how much he suffered. In one of his old martial books he writes about getting depressed and going through a Dark Night after some of his deeper awakenings. So I wouldn't assume he didn't suffer. He just doesn't share that stuff much.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston is an oddball. He is not a good representation of how awakening works for normal people. He ain't normal by his disposition. So be careful emulating him unless your personality type is like his.
</p>

<title>Self/Other Duality: How multiple perspectives seem to be &quot;happening at once&quot;</title>

<p>
	You got it backwards. From God's POV there is no time and no linear sequence of cause and effect. From the human POV things unfold in a linear sequence.
</p>

<p>
	Cause and effect happens in infinite directions from God's POV. This is a huge mindfuck for a human mind.
</p>

		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because when I explicitly asked him about love, he brushed it off as merely an emotion. This clearly shows that something is missing. It's not merely a matter of defintions and words. He is missing that facet of awakening, which is why he doesn't teach it.
</p>

<p>
	Worry about your own bias.

<p>
	Because you ARE Infinite Love. The soul will settle for nothing less.
</p>

<p>
	What you seek is simply consciousness of your true nature.

<p>
	Lust for other women is common for men. It's just how we tend to be wired. But this idea that you should deliberately sleep around is stupid if you are already in a happy relationship.
</p>

<p>
	I would say, if you like this girl, commit to being with her. And if it doesn't work out and you become single, then you can sleep around at that time.
</p>

<p>
	There are times to sleep around, but when you're in a loving relationship already isn't one of those times.
</p>

<p>
	Be mindful that you sleeping around would cause her lots of suffering and it would certianly destroy your relationship. She will never forgive you for sleeping around. Nor should she, because you're acting like an ass, throwing away a good thing by thinking with your dick.
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty absurd to ask for someone else to tell you how to think for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But if you must act so absurdly, I have videos on Contemplation, How To Contemplate Using A Journal, and The Power Of Asking Questions.
</p>

<p>
	What more do you need to know?
