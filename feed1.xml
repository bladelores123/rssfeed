	Rather than endlessly verbally question THIS, just sit in silence and focus attention on THIS. And just sit like that for hours. Very gently, very gently wonder, "What is THIS?"
</p>

<p>
	Do not expect an verbal answer. The answer is THIS itself. The goal here is remove the boundary between THIS and your mind.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You can use a volcano like device or even create your own vape pen carts. Just avoid toxic oils that will ruin your lungs. Use pure turpenes inside of oil.
</p>

<p>
	Both methods work excellently and can be used with basically any powedered psychedelics, including 5-MeO-DMT. You can made a 5-MeO-DMT vape pen. But watch out, even one puff is very intense. Plugging is still superior for 5-MeO-DMT. If N,N-DMT plugged, I would plug it.

<p>
	Solipsism is not awakening. The mistake is thinking that what I'm talking about is solipism when I never made such a claim.
</p>

<p>
	The mind desperately wants some way to understand awakening so it grabs at every philosophical system is can: solipsism, nihilism, panpsychism, Buddhism, etc. And all of that is not awakening.

<p>
	The notion that you have a brain is itself the maze of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	To escape the maze is to realize it never existed other than in your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	When you think, "This is caused by the brain", that's you trapping yourself in the maze. The maze of materialism.

	That's exactly what's happening. But evolution takes time. We are smack dab in the middle of it.

<p>

			firstly, only something ‘other than god’ would need to proclaim itself as being god. Why would god need to say ‘I’m god’,.. I mean... should I write it in my resume now that I’m enlightened? Do I get a free parking spot at selected restaurants that says ‘reserved for god’?
		</p>

		<p>
			Secondly, If you’re proclaiming that you are god, you can only say that to god. I mean think about it, why would you need to say ‘I am god’ and by the way, I won’t even say that you’re speaking to yourself, because that’s another trap the ego likes to hide in, but it just simply implies that you consider the person you’re proclaiming it to something other than god. Such energy can only perpetuate arrogance and entitlement, which are sticking points of ego, not enlightenment.

<p>
	You are speaking nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	You haven't realized what it means to be God. You are playing games.
</p>

<p>
	When you finally realize you are God, you will shout it from the top of your lungs. And all of your logic will fly out the window.
</p>

<p>
	You need to say "I am God" precisely because you're not conscious that you are. False humility is not a virtue here.

	Vaped some moderate doses of N,N-DMT. To me it feels very similar to a low dose of 5-MeO-DMT. Very similar headspace, but 5-MeO-DMT is a lot more potent. 5x to 10x more potent.

	Yup, it's brutal. Which is why alcohol exists.
</p>

<p>
	Without alcohol, the Earth's population would be 75% less.
</p>

<p>
	When doing approaches it's crucial to build up momentum. The first 5 approaches of the night are just a warm up. After the first 5, everything becomes much easier. After 15 approaches in one night, each next approach becomes effortless. Then the next night you gotta start all over again from zero.

<p>
	Let it go.
</p>

<p>
	Notice your mind is acting defensively and selfishly.
</p>

<p>
	To whine about a historically oppressed group of people taking back their power is the epitome of douchebaggery.
</p>

<p>
	To compare feminism with RedPill is silly. They are not in the same ballpark.

For example, if my neighbor is killed and they need to do an investigation of the crime. The police could take a psychedelic and travel back in time to the moment the crime took place to identify the suspects. We could also predict future natural disasters or terrorist attacks.  As you said, science will make more progress in 1 decade with psychedelics than any other field. I don’t see why it can’t be applied practically.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Depends on many factors.
</p>

<p>
	The very notion of enlightenment as temporary or permement is dualistic and untennable since time is imaginary. From God's POV it makes no difference if you awaken for 1 minute or 100 years. As a human you may not like only being awake for 1 minute, but that's not God's problem.
</p>

<p>
	You are only as conscious as your current state of consciousness. It could change any second.
</p>

<p>
	There are states of awakening so high that you could not function as a human from such a state. You could not walk or eat because you'd be too conscious. Life is impossible in such states. So in practice awakening gets tuned down to functional levels or the person would soon die. The highest states are temporary for such practical reasons.
</p>

<p>
	It is not practical to have your car's gas pedal permanently pressed down at max.

Could we also create a psychedelic in which you can speed up time for yourself and see future events? Can we create one in which I reverse time and become 10 years old? Are the possibilities truly endless or can our stream of conciousness only be altered in specific ways?

<p>
	Consciousness is unlimited.

I can get lost in conceptualisation because the mind doesn’t want to turn inwards. Abandoning all concepts and ideas is necessary then to become concious of what conciousness is. This is what marks the transition from stage yellow to turquoise. As I long as I continue to distract myself on this forum by trying to understand awakening and conciousness the farther I get away from The Truth. The next step for me is to do the practices and stop distracting myself on this forum.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Don't fret too much. All this intellectualization is part of your path.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, eventually you will transcend it all.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not  straight path from A to B. It's a twisted path from A to Z with a bunch of stuff in between.
</p>

<p>
	You are struggling to realize you ate God. It doesn't make sense to your human mind how it is possible that you could be God. But keep at it and one day you will awaken. Psychedelics help enormously.

One the number 0-9 are the truly indifferent  numbers once you get to 10 your just combining these numbers its doesn’t seem like its diversely infinite its like using the power of unlimited space to basically repeat forever i mean yeah in a sense if you count up they all be different in a way but they also be very simular 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, each number is unique.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to use 0-9, you could invent a new symbol for each number.
</p>

<p>
	We use 0-9 because it's easier than having to invent and memorize a million symbols.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing special about 0-9. It's just a social convention.
</p>

<p>
	11 is as unique as 1 or 2.

	Spiral Dynamics isn't really a measure of consciousness, it's a measure of mental development. Ultimately this is a minor and existentially insigificant thing. Awakening does not map to Spiral Dynamics at all. SD is just a handy model for understanding average humans.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the sense of awakening in a totally different league.
</p>

<p>
	Look around you. Can you point to anything which isn't consciousness? Try.

	Debates are only done ignorant minds.
</p>

<p>
	Ignorants love to spin their wheels in their ignorance. Ignorance likes to strut around and posture like a cock. That's what debate is. It has nothing to do with genuine truth-seeking.

			I understand that. But please describe "fully conscious." It's a misnomer. The Dial is infinite, and your consciousness of God deepens and broadens all the time. At what point do you say, "now you're fully conscious."? I'm baffled that something you recently described as a complex set of dials has now been reduced to a binary on/off. From my experience and others, it's clear that the dial analogy is much more accurate. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It is an infinite dial, but there are points on the dial where God awakens to itself as God.
</p>

<p>
	God realization is a distinct event. Either it is, or is not occuring. This point delineates awakeness vs asleepness. But even so, there are many degrees to God's self-awareness. Hence many levels of awakeness.
</p>

<p>
	Almost no one has reached the highest levels. Not even your favorite enlightened teachers. I consider most of them asleep.

	No because creation is endless. God itself cannot ever reach its own end because it has no beginning or end.

<p>
	Kambo will make you vomit your guts out.
</p>

<p>
	But that can be healing.
</p>

<p>
	You can use the search function to find some old threads about peoples' experiences with it.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't expect it to heal serious things like Alzheimers. But it might heal you at the mental/spiritual level, helping you shed some ego.
</p>

<p>
	Kambo is not a psychedelic at all. It is a poison. It's basically like deliberately getting bit by a snake just for the experience.

	When you are being aware that you are human, you are actually misunderstanding what you are. You are imagining that you are human, in the same way that you could imagine that you are a kangaroo. But that doesn't make you a kangaroo. Only in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you are God. But you are too busy imagining you are human to notice this. The human obscures the God like clouds the sun.

	As you do more of this work you will become more compassionate with regards to the needless suffering of others.
</p>

<p>
	You need a heart awakening to really start to care about people. Most peoples' hearts are so closed and all they care about is themselves. But you cannot create a well-functioning and healthy community that way.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a family in which no one cared about the others. It would be a toxic disaster.

</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean you can't be passionate about your LP.
</p>

<p>
	But also, if you're first starting to become conscious of the existential Emptiness of life, that will likely rob you of motivation and make you depressed for a short period of time until you integrate it and the ego gets over it.
</p>

<p>
	A sense of meaninglessness and loss is a common egoic reaction to deep consciousness work. It will pass once you go deeper. It is one of the many threshold guardians which guard the deepest Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Trust that your sense of passion will come back even stronger once you fully awaken. But also be open to your passions changing and evolving. Maybe your passion for your current work will die completely but that's because some new greater passion with take its place. Be open to that.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, the ego will go through a period of mourning its own death. Just like it does with the death of a loved one. There is a period of resistance, emotional upheaval, depression, then acceptance, letting go, and moving on.

	Of course authoritarianism exists precisely because it works.
</p>

<p>
	But it only works up to a certain point.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness it stops working and becomes counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	So yes, at certain (low) levels of consciousness you have to be a dick to be successful.
</p>

<p>
	But at the highest levels of consciousness being a dick will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Not understanding that there are different levels of consciousness and that your followers have different levels of consciousness and different systems of values will make this guy's analysis and interviews incomplete.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different leadership styles which correspond to consciousness and values levels. Not to mention that you someone cannot escape being a dick if they are stuck in a certain level of consciousness. The leader himself has to grow massively to stop being authoritarian and yet remain effective. This is not easy to do for most people. Which is why its so rare and authoritarianism and abuse of power is so common.

<p>
	Yes, you are afraid. I understand that. Your entire life is dominated by survival and fear of death. That's what keeps you from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Smoking DPT 50 times is not dangerous if done properly. Nor do you have to smoke DPT at all. You could simply do some hardcore meditation or self-inquiry.

<p>
	The ego mind desires demonstrations. Awakening has nothing to do with manipulating realty. Awakening is the realization that everything is exactly as it is.
</p>

<p>
	No one can awaken you but yourself. God will never force itself on you. I am not going to play your games of trying to change your mind because your mind is not interested in change. Your mind is closed and you are not interested in serious inquiry as is clear by your arrogant attitude and lack of serious work. If you were doing serious work you would  not be on this forum arguing with me and asking for demonstrations. You would deep in meditation & contemplation trying to realize the Truth for yourself. But you are not at this point yet because you're very early in your journey. You are skeptical, and I totally get that. But you must understand that from my POV your skepticism is as silly as a child doubting that 1+1=2. It is a waste of time to even entertain such skepticism from an awakened position. Absolute Truth is prior to any possible skepticism or doubt because it is not a function of thought, belief, or mind. Absolute Truth cannot be thought, so it cannot be doubted either.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Because all "use", utility, and value is a fiction. Nothing needs to be changed. Reality is Absolute Perfection. But you are too busy looking for utility, too busy manipulating reality to awaken to this fact. You want to drag God down into the domain of survival, thinking this will prove God. But this assumes survival is a true domain. In fact, survival is the domain of falsehood so God has no business there. God does not care about survival. It is beneath God. So rather than trying to drag God down to your level you must be willing to raise yourself up to God's level.
</p>

<p>
	The will of God is EVERYTHING! That's what you don't fathom. Nothing can happen which isn't the will of God. The whole planet could die tomorrow and it would be perfectly fine. Realizing this creates liberation since there is no need to manipulate anything. Manipulation is a function of survival which is falsehood. To God it does not matter what happens because God's mind is conscious enough to see that all value and judgment is falsehood. No state of reality is better or worse than any other. So there is no need to change it. Awakening does not grant the ego the ability to manipulate the world using God's will, rather it eliminates the ego entirely, surrendering you to God will precisely as it is. It is the ego-mind which wants to use God's powers to manipulate the world. And that is precisely what God will not allow because that would be to allow devilry to flourish.
</p>

<p>
	If you wish to access God, the cost is total surrender of your self. You must give up all of your attachments and demands. Which, of course, is the last thing you want to do. You want to hijack God for your selfish purposes. If you could, you would try to use God to become a tyrant over men. You would try to use God to get sex, power, money, luxury, and everything else your impure ego craves. And this is precisely what you are denied. Because that is devilry.

<p>
	Omniscience isn't what you imagine it to be. It is not a knowledge of relative things. It is Absolute Consciousness. All knowledge is finite and relative. I don't know what you had for breakfast. But I am conscious of how I create the entire universe. That's the paradox of awakening.

<p>
	That is your problem. You fundamentally misunderstand this work. This work is not about me convincing you of anything. This work requires that you be willing to surrender your arrogant mind in a personal search for Truth. You have to want the Truth so bad that it will literally kill you. And that is precisely what you don't want. So you will never find the Truth and I will never be able to convince you otherwise. Because your entire attitude comes from fear.

			I am also curious about one more thing. I remember watching a video of yours where you stated that science will be done non-symbolically 500 years from now. What did you mean by that exactly? Are you thinking that the nondual paradigm would affect scientific research traditions for the better? Can you give me a brief sketch of what this would look like, especially in areas like neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology and fundamental physics?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Science and mysticism will start to merge. The greatest scientists will be those who can access non-ordinary states of consciousness and have direct insight into the nature of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Science is by definition symbolic because it requires communication and coordination which cannot be done other than through language. But individual scientists can venture off by themselves and explore consciousness and bring back nuggets. The difficulty will be coordinating that with others.
</p>

<p>
	Science itself will be transcended and that transcendence of it will eventually transform what science is.
</p>

<p>
	No matter how much science you do, you will always be as far away from understand reality as you were before you started doing science. Because reality is infinite and science is finite. So you can do science forever and still never get any closer to the end. All scientific discovery is relative. Relative, but useful.
</p>

<p>
	Neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and fundamental physics will admit that their discoveries are relative to certain states of consciousness. Fundamental physics is only true relative to an ordinary human state of consciousness and within a very narrow symbolic framework. All science is human species biased and ultimately imaginary. But imaginary things can still be useful. So it's useful for survival.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Anyhow, this will be my last communication here. I cannot teach a student who insists he is right.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck with your journey through the labyrinths of your own mind.
</p>

<p>
	I wish you total awakening.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Try to really appreciate this: your mind is deliberately tricking you not to awaken. Every thought you think is already hijacked to maintain your sense of self and reality. So when you think, "Leo is wrong" << that's already the trick.

	You guys love to play word games.
</p>

<p>
	When you are fully conscious that you are God, that is enlightenment/awakening. How long it lasts is irrelevant. It could last 1 minute or 100 years. For as long as you are conscious, you are awake. As soon as you are not conscious, you are asleep.
</p>

<p>
	If you are in doubt whether you're awake, you're asleep. If you have questions about what God is or means, you are asleep.

	They are perfectly identical.
</p>

<p>
	God is that which has no self. Which makes it the One Absolute Self -- an infinite being that contains all beings.

<p>
	Just no.
</p>

<p>
	It was created by people who actually seriously awoke.
</p>

<p>
	There is a clear difference between those who awoke and those who have not. Stop muddling the waters by saying everyone is woke.

<p>
	Look at society like a family. If your mother got cancer, you would never leave her alone to die because she couldn't pay $2,000 month for her medication while you were swimming in cash and buying million dollar vacation homes and sports cars. You would not charge your mother $70,000 for treatment.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	60,000+ people die each year in America from lack of ability to pay for healthcare. Does that make any sense? Purely from a financial POV if these people didn't die think of how much tax money they would bring in over their lifetimes. It's idiotic for the government to let them die. The government is actually losing money on each death. Each person can bring in at least $5k to $10k in tax revenue each year. Not to mention the compassion angle.
</p>

<p>
	I don't feel he deeply understands Green. Because he hasn't fully gone through it.
</p>

<p>
	He's very rationalistic, materialistic, and moralistic.
</p>

<p>
	His political positions are problematic when he does his whole Islamophobia thing and his race IQ thing.
</p>

<p>
	One of the hallmarks of Yellow is non-judgment and the ability to appreciate the relativity of different perspectives. Sam has some of that, but not too deep.
</p>

<p>
	Again, he def has some Yellow, but not 100% Yellow. It's pretty pointless splitting hairs over this. You're never going to know a person's entire Spiral profile. We're just making best guesses here.

Truth and consciousness are not things to be debated at all.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Sam Harris is more developed than JP and of course Ben Shaprio. But Sam has plenty of Orange yet in him, and he is certainly not awake.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, he has a good deal of Yellow in him. But Yellow is not that high when we are talking about things like truth, consciousness, love, God, nonduality, spirituality, etc. Yellow is still childhood.
</p>

<p>
	Sam Harris is very moralistic and does not understand relativity. So he hasn't fully integrated Green.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple. To be fully enlightened is to realize you are God and that you create the entire universe. If you're not conscious of that, you ain't really enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	If there is even one hair of separation between you and God, you're not fully awake.
</p>

<p>
	How you act towards others is a tangential matter. Enlightenment is not about behavior or action, it's about consciousness of what you are. You're either conscious that you are God or you're not.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of it, for sure.
</p>

<p>
	But I've also experienced what I would call a "full awakening". I think extremely few people have experienced it. Most gurus, teachers, and masters have not. I don't know any teacher who I consider fully awake.

<p>
	Your questions are directly part of the field of philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	Psychology will never even attempt to answer what existence is.
</p>

<p>
	But academic philosophy will also never succeed in answering what existence is. That can only be done via awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You created existence. So who are you asking? You are it!
</p>

<p>
	If you truly, fully awake, then yes. But that's so challenging and rare that you are better off working directly on your social anxiety.
</p>

<p>
	True and full awakening has the potential to cure everything. But are you willing to full awaken? Do you dare?

<p>
	Of course real science relies on anecdotal evidence all the time. That's what clinical trials are. It's just very rigorous.
</p>

<p>
	But many fools have no idea how real science works.
</p>

<p>
	But yet, many scientists are far too dismissive of any modality which doesn't have a simply material physical explanation. So they will accept anecdotal evidence for a new chemical drug, but they will not for something like acupuncture.

<p>
	To say he has done psychedelics is highly deceptive. He has toyed around with them at most and has no idea what they really are or mean.
</p>

<p>
	He's too fearful and neurotic to use them properly. Same with Sam Harris.

<p>
	To be technical about it, there is no difference between life being a dream and life being real.
</p>

<p>
	Reality = dream
</p>

	So you can say the glass is half full or half empty and both are right.

<p>
	Nothing comes close to ibogaine for opioid withdrawal. Ibgaine resets the brain's opioid receptors effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
	Tell her to fly to Canada, Mexico, or Costa Rica to an ibogaine clinic.
</p>

<p>
	Ibogaine must be administered by a nurse. You cannot do it at home.

</p>

<p>
	Your desire for art and creativity is selflessness. That is your way of reconnecting with God. That is your church.
</p>

<p>
	Your only problem is your guilt and self-judgment. Let it go and pursue your art guilt-free.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let selfish people gaslight you or make you feel guilty. You fell for the gaslighting.

			I encourage everyone to make a Tinder profil with some regular good looking (top 10%) guy. Just leave the profile text empty, it doesnt matter.

			Its a truly eye opening experiece, within hours you will get hundreds of matches and women will actively contact you. You can say the most braindead/evil/boring stuff and they wont loose interest. Just opening with "Sex?" will get a positive answer. A guy like this can arrange sex with 10+ different girls by putting in 1 hour of half assed effort.

<p>
	This is totally true because online dating is 100% about looks. Nothing else matters.
</p>

<p>
	When you post a pic of yourself online, that's all you're reducing yourself down to.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not a classically handsome guy, this is a terrible strategy for you because you are not displaying your other great qualities. Your strategy must be to get hot girls in-person with your personality, not your looks. Girls respond very differently in-person.
</p>

<p>
	Online is the lazy man's game. If you are lazy with game, don't be surprised when your results look lazy too.
</p>

<p>
	The bulk of a man's attractiveness is in his personality and the life he's built. So to reduce yourself to a profile pic is like selling a diamond at a dollar store.

			Does anyone on here do regular solo camping? Or have experience with bushcraft? If so, can you maintain spiritual practice in the wilderness? Obviously meditation would be easy, but I've always wondered whether it would be possible to do a solo bush retreat, and maintain a Hatha yoga practice. Perhaps I will take this on as my own challenge.

</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice you will be so busy just surviving in the wilderness that you will have very little time for true meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation requires completely detaching from survival. So it's actually easier to do in a well furnished home where most of your survival needs are easily handled. Ideally you'd have someone else even cook your food, so you don't get distracted. Even taking a shit is a distraction.
</p>

<p>
	Notice just how much survival distracts you.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you just love camping or want to do it professionally, by all means. But don't confuse that with consciousness work.

	There is.

<p>
	Take a psychedelic with the intention to become conscious of all your projections, assumptions, and judgments. And be ready for a beating.
</p>

<p>
	And while you're at it, become conscious of what "other" is. You may be shocked to discover that other itself is nothing but your projection.

			Why don't these people then distinguish themselves from traditional communism?
		</p>

		<p>
			Even modern facists clearly distinguish themselves from the "nazis" we know from history books
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	First of all, they do. The problem is that the audience listening isn't intetested in making such a distinction. Conservatives and centrists like to play dumb because that serves the status quo. It serves Michael Bloomberg to think Bernie is a communist. It serves Jordan Peterson to think that trans activists are in the same category as Stalin and Lenin. Of course this is absurd. But they cannot see it because their careers and realities depend on them not seeing it.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, even Bernie and others like him are not conscious enough to understand what a distinction is. So they don't fully understand that the audience lacks the distinctions they have. Bernie takes his distinctions for granted.
</p>

<p>
	It's one thing to make a distinction, and it's a whole nother thing to know you've made a distinction and that the people you're speaking with haven't made it in their minds. That's some next level stage Yellow and Turquoise shit. Very, very few humans on this planet understand such subtle things. And it's not like you could explain it in a 2 minute CNN segment.
</p>

<p>
	Most of you here still have no idea what a distinction is, and you have been studying this stuff for years.

	Here's a very basic fact to contemplate:
</p>

<p>
	If these things did not work for some people, they would not exist.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is finding out if they work for your particular problem. They may, or may not. It depends on hundreds of factors. And the only way you'll know is by testing it yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Health issues can be very, very complex.

You can feel this inside yourself if you introspect genuinely.
</p>

<p>
	If your keep speaking from a closed mind, don't be surprised if you get banned. You're walking right on the edge. It seems from your POV that you're being intelligent and reasonable, but you are speaking from ignorance. I don't know how else to get you to understand this.
</p>

<p>
	Once again, open your mind. People here are trying to telling you about a radical truth which you have no understanding of yet. It's not personal. You just don't comprehend the depth of what consciousness is because you are asleep.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you are a dog and we are pointing to the moon and you keep biting the finger. You are missing the moon entirely. But your mind is fooling you into thinking that you know best and that you can rationalize and argue your way out of this problem. You can't. It takes the guidance of an awakened being to show you that you are asleep. But that cannot happen if your mind is closed and you keep insisting that you know best.
</p>

<p>
	You are inside of a dream. And everything your mind says maintains the "reality" of that dream. Your mind will defend, to the death, your dream. Which is what you have been doing this entire thread. But you're not conscious that you're doing it. Either start to wake up or this forum is not for you. This is a waking up forum. Arguing and reasoning will not wake you up. You have yet to realize that.
</p>

<p>
	If you have an emotional reaction to anything said here, just notice that, rather than acting from it. Those emotional reactions are your mind fooling you into staying asleep. You are ideologically attached to the notion of an objective reality because your entire life hinges on it, and yet it is entirely a fiction of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	My words are not something for you to believe or disbelieve, but to investigate. You can validate everything simply by carefully and patiently observing how your own mind works. Waking up is not a function of believing new things. All beliefs are part of the dream your mind creates. So is rationality, logic, science, and religion.
</p>

<p>
	You have to realize that there is something extremely profound that I am trying to communicate to you right now. But you have to really open your mind first in order to start to get it.
</p>

<p>
	If you fail to get the communication, that's okay. I understand. But you then need to understand that we are not going to waste our time babysitting you and over-explaining things to you here. Our time is better invested in helping those whose minds are open enough to hear the communication.
</p>

<p>
	Old school Soviet style communism of the Leninist stripe is more stage Blue than Green.
</p>

<p>
	Few people have the cognitive frameworks necessary to distinguish the difference between Blue vs Green or old-school communism vs Bernie-style Democratic Socialism.
</p>

<p>
	Even well-educated professors like Jordan Peterson fail to make such distinctions. Because their minds are closed and locked in various paradigms.
</p>

<p>
	Very, very few humans think for themselves. Mostly humans just ape other humans.

</p>

<p>
	But 5-MeO-DMT is beyond words.
</p>

<p>
	Shrooms have no limit to their potency. You can eat as much as your stomach can hold and trips forever higher. Your mind will not be able to handle it. So there's no glass ceiling potency-wise. The ceiling is your fragile mind.
</p>

<p>
	Shroom are quite challenging at higher doses. Otherwise psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT are easier because they are clearer. Shrooms can be wacky, twisted, and confusing.
</p>

<p>
	But everyone needs to experience shrooms at least a few times in their life. They have a very magical earthy mystical quality.

			Show me a synopsis where government has given power back to a business.  I don't take issue with people negotiating with businesses for wages and benefits, this is happening now.  My struggle is with government taking over businesses, which is what Bernie is proposing.

	Deregulation and privatization happen commonly in many countries. The results are often bad for the people but great for a small few oligarchs who hoard the resources.

			It's just where I'm currently at one of the concerns I have is how does one discern the territory they discover isn't <em>truly</em> any different from the maps of religion, science, or belief?
