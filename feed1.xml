</blockquote>

<p>
	The realization of nonduality is an extremely radical shift. Really, your old life is gone. You are dead at this point, so the question of "function" (survival) is moot. There is nothing left to survive. The game of life is over. You have awoken from survival.
</p>

<p>
	Consider, the only reason you worry about survival issues is because you hold the belief that you are alive. What would happen if that belief was surrendered? What would happen if you surrendered all control over your life such that there was zero effort or struggle? What would happen if you became God? Would worry about anything?
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is not a paradigm. It is Absolute.
</p>

I would guess that 90% of people who watch Actualized.org take zero action so they get very little results. It's like watching videos about weightlifting and expecting to get jacked without ever stepping foot in the gym.
</p>

<p>
	This work requires serious intention, motivation, passion, and persistence. By definition, 99% of people will be too lazy and myopic to do it. We are talking about the most advanced wisdom available to mankind. This will not be actualized effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want, you can totally transform your life. The choice is yours. How serious are you gonna take it?
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't take 3 years to see results.
</p>

<p>
	If you were serious, in 3 years you could earning hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash or transcend death using the information I've talked about.
</p>

<p>
	The problem isn't that what I say it too good to be true, it's that it's so true you'll hardly believe it when you see it.
</p>

<p>
	Probably not in practice.
</p>

<p>
	Careful not to get fixated on being perfectly developed. This is just more ego. Just focus on becoming more conscious one bit at a time and enjoy life. Do not make personal development a mission. The mission is to enjoy life, not to be working on yourself forever.

<p>
	Self/other is a duality, which means it must ultimately collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Those people you call "other" are really just facets of yourself in the same way that all actors in a movie are all one movie.
</p>

<p>
	There exists nothing but YOU. But not the personal ego you, the Cosmic You. You as the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	Look at another human being in the eyes and realize they are you. Don't think about it. Actually try it.
</p>

<p>
	This is best realized on a psychedelic. Your ordinary mode of consciousness is too weak to see it in most cases without massive concentration work.
</p>

<p>
	This is untrue. Don't limit yourself with such kinds of black & white beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	Programming is a solid way to earn a living, but there are many other ways, many better ways. You can basically create whatever career you want if you apply yourself seriously to it.

<p>
	Obviously it would work. It just seems like an extreme step to take and comes with needless dangers.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging works great. You don't lose anything if your technique is good.

<title>Conspiracy Theories and the Ego (Alex Jones)</title>

</p>

<p>
	All cults create an evil "other" to fight against. This allows the ego to feel good about itself, thus avoiding self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
	Self-righteousness is a dead giveaway of egoic behavior.
</p>

<p>
	When you are deeply conscious of Truth and Being, you will not act self-righteously or judgmentally. Judgment automatically disconnects you from Truth.

<p>
	The ego loves to assume it is already fully developed. That conveniently means no more work is required. The ego loves to live in the world of ideals, abstractions, intellectualizations, and soothing fantasies.
</p>

<p>
	You constantly have to give yourself reality-checks in this work. You must be brutally honest with yourself about your deficiencies, limitations, and lack of development. As a rule of thumb you are never as developed or as conscious as you think you are.
</p>

<p>
	It's very easy to listen to advanced stages like Yellow and Turquoise and to assume you're already there just because you intellectually understand those stages or you can picture them in your mind's eye. But that's just imagination. That's not the actual level you're acting from on a daily basis. Most of your daily actions probably stem from much lower levels like Red, Blue, Orange.
</p>

<p>
	A very helpful exercise is to monitor all of your thoughts on any given day and analyze what percentage of your thoughts are stemming from which color stage? How much time do you spend thinking about money, sex, power, fear, selfish needs, dogma, judgment, anger, etc? Probably 90%+ How much time do you spend in systems thinking, metaphysical contemplation, unconditional love, or solving global problems? Probably less than 1%.
</p>

<title>Collective ego problems</title>

Which then creates a toxic collective ego.
</p>

<p>
	Of course collective ego also loves to disable transparency. For example, CIA secret torture programs and NSA wiretapping thrive on lack of transparency, so they cannot be held accountable. And that's when evil happens.
</p>

<p>
	The individual ego off-loads responsibility onto the collective ego, and the collective ego off-loads responsibility onto the individual ego in a game of phone-tag. You see the ego's game? It always points the finger at someone else. That's how the devil operates because the devil cannot ever stand looking in the mirror -- because then he'd see his own devilish face, which would contradict his self-image of being an angel. The devil always thinks he's an angel and refuses to see any evidence to the contrary -- therein lies the devilry.

Go watch some Matt Kahn videos and practice some self-love and self-acceptance. You cannot change your life from a position of self-flagellation and self-hatred. Well, you can, but it's gonna be very ugly.
</p>

<p>
	Being harsh with yourself just tends to heap ego on top of ego, problem on top of problem.
</p>

<p>
	Slow down, collect yourself, find peace in the now, and slowly begin the process of assembling your life, brick by brick. All the resources you need are basically available these days online.

<p>
	Anonymity in large numbers creates a lack of responsibility. Individual responsibility is off-loaded onto someone else and evil behavior becomes normalized: "everyone's doing it, so it must okay for me to do it too."
</p>

<p>
	In small tribes anonymity is impossible. But in a society of millions of people, and online, it's the opening of Pandora's box. When nobody is holding you accountable it's much easier to behave like a devil.

	People here grow and change a lot. People outgrow this forum and go off on their own. Which is exactly as it should be.

<p>
	Don't create false limiting beliefs like that. I get messages, comments, and emails from people on a daily basis with stories of who much they've grown or changed.

<p>
	Deficiency needs is a good answer, but I would also say lack of familiarity with the Spiral Dynamics model itself, and lack of epistemic inquiry. The dynamics of knowledge (epistemology) needs to be directly explored and contemplated.
</p>

<p>
	Also systems thinking. Seeing the world as a complex web of impersonal inter-related systems. Most problems are systemic problems requiring systemic solutions. Few people look at the world this way. They look at the world too personally, as if the world revolves around them and their judgments, as if the solutions are linear and black & white. Yellow is nonlinear thinking. Most people are highly linear thinkers.

<p>
	Yes, but Green still clings too much to its SJW perspective as being superior.
</p>

<p>
	Green is not able to detach enough from its own perspective.

<p>
	Reality is smarter than all human minds combined.

<p>
	That's a solid strategy. I don't recommend working at McDonalds.
</p>

<p>
	But this topic of resources is too detailed and complex to discuss here.
</p>

<p>
	Just by doing some solid googling you can find mostly anything you need. You have to be serious about it though. There are literally 1000s of amazing resources but you're too lazy to use them.

<p>
	Man, for now, I would say just forget about that. Your mind is filled with fantasies of being some crazy Buddha. Don't worry about that for now. Spend the next 5 years just learning how to survive and thrive in America. Then revisit the Buddha issue.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, Buddha was 27 years old when he left behind his life of luxury, success, and family. He had a wife and child. He was experienced with the ways of material living. And then it took him another 6 years to finally get enlightened. So you've got plenty of time. 23 year olds are basically babies. You have virtually no life experience or survival skills. So build those up.
</p>

<p>
	This is not unique to you. Most 23 year olds these days are like this. As was I at that time. You'd be amazed how much can get accomplished in 10 years. Way more than you could image.

</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what medication you're on, you can still mindfully observe and inquire into emotions. Your entire life is run by emotions 24/7. The issue isn't that you have too few emotions, it's that you're totally overwhelmed by them to the point where you cannot even tell where an emotion ends and your life begins.
</p>

<p>
	Observing and deconstructing emotions is very challenging work, for anyone, regardless of medications or not.
</p>

<p>
	You could start by observing every day in which ways you suppress emotions.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to say: "thought and emotions are so impaired that all contact is lost with external reality."
</p>

<p>
	As it turns out, external reality is a thought!
</p>

<p>
	To be lost in a fantasy, thought is not impaired, thought is hyper-active.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of meditation/yoga is to impair thought.

</p>

<p>
	Just make sure you keep yourself grounded in actuality. Be careful not to conflate direct glimpses with your feelings, thoughts, theories, and images of them. The deepest truths are not images.
</p>

<p>
	Distinguish between the creations of your mind (thoughts, stories, images, memories) vs actual BEING. This is paramount. Notice that nothing you think or imagine about the Truth is the Truth.

<p>
	Overall I would put him at Orange/Green. The part in him that I find Yellow is his openmindedness to diverse perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	I mostly used Joe as an example of the multi-perspective aspect of Yellow. But that's far from Yellow's only aspect.
</p>

<p>
	Joe still has a lot of Orange that he needs to transcend.
</p>

<p>
	The deeper I learn about Yellow, the more I see that extremely few people are solidly at Yellow. Yellow is very deep and sophisticated.

</p>

<p>
	Most of what you used to think of as "reality" was just a thought-based fantasy. Including your own birth and the existence of other people.

<p>

Learn to survive in the world a bit more so that you develop a knack for success and getting stuff done. As you meet those lower level needs, you'll be ready to move up into higher needs.
</p>

<p>
	A skyscraper must be built on a solid foundation. Don't worry about spending a few years learning how to do business. Business is important to learn. Practical skills are important to learn. You want to handle all of your survival needs so that then you have lots of free time to delve into spirituality, art, etc. It's kinda hard to do art when you can't pay your bills.
</p>

<p>
	Learning to get practical stuff done is part of your developmental growth. I had to learn a lot of practical stuff before I could get Actualized.org off the ground. Actualized.org runs due to practical know-how, not airy-fairy spiritual ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Go learn to be a programmer or whatever you need to move you along towards your dreams. I learned lots of scripting and programming because it is so useful.

</p>

<p>
	I noticed you saying several times that you "believe" this.
</p>

<p>
	What is your direct experience of God?
</p>

<p>
	If I was shooting a video like this (and I do have this topic planned for the future as a video), I would make sure to stress that God is not a belief, or a theory, or a speculation, but a direct experience which the viewer can have. This is what's most amazing about God: you can realize it for yourself! This is what most people misunderstand. A newbie watching your video would walk away with the idea that what you're talking about it is just a philosophical theory of God. The viewer would think, "Well, how does this guy know? He's just theorizing. This is just his opinion."
</p>

<p>
	It's absolutely critical to plant the seed in the viewer's mind that consciousness of God is a real thing and requires doing concrete practices. Otherwise God forever remains an idea. The whole point of such a video would be to get people to realize that they must start doing the necessary practices.
</p>

<p>
	Other distinctions which might have been useful are realism vs idealism, and esoteric vs exoteric versions of religion. Really what your video was debunking were the exoteric versions of God. All mainstream religions are exoteric. Most religious people don't even know that esoteric religion is possible.
</p>

<p>
	It's a very tricky topic, so you did a decent job.
</p>

<p>
	The tricky thing about God is, it's both deeply personal and impersonal, encompassing every set of attributes.
</p>

It mostly tests for psychedelic Indoles.
</p>

<p>
	Those other tests are be useful too for filtering out other harmful agents (you don't want to find meth in your psychedelic), but you need a positive test for Indoles.
</p>

<p>
	There is no test kit that's able to distinguish 5-MeO-DMT from other Indoles. And freebase vs HCl is not something you can test with a kit. The kit don't care.
</p>

<p>
	Test kits are not to be fully trusted. Which is why you always want to test new substances with very small doses to verify your batch is what it claims to be.

<title>How evolved is Joe Rogan and people like him?</title>

<p>
	Joe is a decent guy for what he's doing. You just have to understand that his show is not about spirituality or personal development or truth or consciousness or serious science. It's basically about mainstream gossip. It's a gossip show with some tidbits of wisdom. But also a lot of egotistical nonsense. It's not designed to be a spiritual path. It's designed to be fun gossip. And if you think of it on those terms, it's great. Not everything has to be ultra serious and profound.
</p>

<p>
	But if you expect to become deeply woke listening to his show, then you'll be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
	Relative to other talk show hosts, Joe is pretty wise & evolved. But then again, that's not the highest of bars to clear.
</p>

			That is not necessarily true. There are different teaching strategies. For example, if someone has an approach like UG Krishnamurti or Karl Renz the "bashing" (or making fun of) includes almost everything and everyone. "Unconditional hate" as Karl likes to say.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is not masterful teaching. That kind of polarized teaching style does a disservice to students, as it makes them ideological and emotionally reactive. Teachers who teach like that are themselves not fully developed & conscious.
</p>

<p>
	I myself have had to back off that style as I become more conscious. It is a disservice to you guys. Because in truth, there is no one to blame for anything. Everyone is doing their best, even terrorists, Nazis, psychopaths, and cult leaders. They cannot help being who they are and the proper response to their situation is understanding and compassion, not hate or ridicule.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I've wanted to shoot a rant video against JP for a long time now. But I hold myself back because I would rather take the high road. Even though a rant video against JP would get me lots of views and clicks and approval -- it would also make you guys more ideological against him and distract from doing the inner work. So I bite my tongue.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the ego's whole game is to get you to avoid doing the inner work by any means possible. So ego loves to externalize the problem and make it about something "out there" -- some teacher, some teaching, some other group of people, some culture war issue, some political scandal, some latest outrage -- anything to avoid self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
	I have no interest in getting into public battles with anyone or defending my work. I just want to work on myself and be creative without any justifications for my work. My work speaks for itself. If you find my work useful, then use it. If not, then leave and pursue other things. Telling me you disagree with my work is unnecessary. I know better than most of you the flaws and limitations of my own work. I don't need guidance from a random cocky Youtuber who does not know anything about me. I get my internal guidance from a much higher quality, non-human source.
</p>

<p>
	And in the end if you feel my guidance is bad or wrong, don't follow me. I am not here to be right, or perfect, or the Buddha, or your daddy figure. From the very beginning the only function of Actualized.org was to catalogue various insights that I have that I find interesting. That's all this is. There is no pretense to Truth in my teachings since all teachings are concepts and by definition partial and untrue.
</p>

<p>
	Anything that you hear me say is ultimately nonsense. It was that way from day one, and it could not be otherwise. From the very beginning my work is was meant to be self-effacing. Like a snake eating its own tail, such that in the end, nothing remains.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's an intuitive high-level hunch based on subtle cues.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, often these people display their egotism in very obvious ways. For example, no serious teacher would make the core of his teaching the bashing of other teachers. That's an obvious red flag. That's ego reaction, not genuine teaching. People who spend a lot of their time and energy criticizing other teachers or teachings automatically reveal their own lack of consciousness, as all criticism is ultimately untenable and absurd. Reality cannot be otherwise, so there is nothing wrong and no one to blame. When you become deeply conscious, the desire to criticize anything falls away entirely, because it is an ego-game.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become of the devil within you, the easier it becomes to spot Zen devils and their tactics. After years of doing this work you will smell ego from miles away because you've studied it so deeply within yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out for people who make a lot of noise and stir up controversy needlessly, over and over again. This is a very popular online marketing tactic of late. People like Trump, JP, Mike Cernovich, Steven Crowder, Alex Jones, Sam Harris, etc. are master manipulators in this regard. Any cult leader wannabe is going to be a master manipulator & bullshit artist.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand the trickeries of running such a community.
</p>

<p>
	I crack down on stuff like this immediately because egos will not hesitate to exploit this community to build their own cults and brands.
</p>

<p>
	People like Rali and TJ turn criticism into a marketing strategy. The strategy is to stir up a fake controversy to gain views and free advertizing. In my book, this is unacceptable. What they are looking for is attention, which is why they are denied any air whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to criticize me or Actualized.org, go for it. I don't care. But I am not going to let you turn it into a marketing strategy, nor will I allow you to poach members to start your own movement or brand because I do not trust your devilish ego to create a non-cult community.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make is they get a little taste of self-actualization or spirituality and then they think they got what it takes to teach or run a spiritual community. But they are so ignorant of the dangers involved.
</p>

<p>
	I take great care to make sure Actualized.org never becomes a harmful ideological organization. People who I judge to be building harmful ideological organizations are not allowed here. 
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing new here. This has happened before and it will happen again. Every year a new Zen devil comes here to start his cult. I spot such devils immediately. I smell them a mile away. I spotted Rali very early on. The trouble is, they cleverly exploit this because a healthy community must allow criticism. So it becomes a PR problem banning such people because it makes me look like an insecure tyrannt. So it's a tricky balance to strike because they will abuse this to craft their marketing strategy.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, if you guys wish to criticize myself or Actualized.org in a serious way, go for it. I will not close such a thread, but if you do it as a marketing strategy or you are doing it from a place of ego as a distraction, then it will be shut down.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with criticism is that the ego loves to use it to muddy up the waters so much that people get lost and confused. It easily becomes a distraction from doing the work. It's so easy to create fake controversy and milk that cow. But even so, criticism and receptivity to feedback is necessary in any healthy community / organization.
</p>

<p>
	So I welcome constructive criticism and feedback which has no ulterior business motive.
</p>

<p>
	Of course
</p>

<p>
	All religion is nondual teaching in some sense. The only question is, How much has the teaching been corrupted? And, How well is its original intention understood?

<p>
	Truth is all around you. You're just failing to recognize it as such because you're holding Truth as a concept. Truth is not a concept, Truth is being.

</p>

<p>
	Serious business training is never done through books. Books are too cheap for that.
</p>

<p>
	Try taking a $1000 course or $3000 seminar. That's where you'll learn practical stuff. No one is going to put that information into a $20 book.
</p>

<p>
	Serious business advice is very costly. Because if it's any good, it's worth tens of thousands of dollars.
</p>

<p>
	At $10,000 business seminar is not unreasonable.

<p>
	There is no difference between enlightenment in Buddhism and Hinduism or any other major religion.

<p>
	Not in the slightest.
</p>

<p>
	But I did have a powerful vision for my life, I was very ambitious, and I was following my heart. Which is really all that matters.
</p>

<p>
	You are young. You've got many years to put all of those things in place. Obviously don't waste time sitting around on your ass, but don't panic either.
</p>

<p>
	Right now what you're missing is hope and faith in your vision.
</p>

<p>
	Vision is useless if you don't have rock-solid faith in it. You need to train yourself to believe in it. Visualize it every day with a hopeful vibe. Do not visualize it pessimistically, negatively, full of fear. That is terrible. That is counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	Holding a big vision is not easy. It is scary. Your mind will not believe it is possible. I used all sorts of mind programming techniques to reinforce my vision and overcome various doubts. But the most important thing is HEART! You must have HEART! That is what carries you through everything. Your life purpose must be non-negotiable. You are doing it no matter what. There should be no option for failure because you already know there is nothing else you'd rather do.
</p>

<p>
	There will hundreds of doubts in this journey. You have to really cultivate hope. Not in luck, but in your hard work. Your vision will get actualized through honest labor.
</p>

<p>
	And remember, a big vision requires lots of patience. You don't need to be Buddha by next month. Recalibrate your exceptions and split your vision up into smaller chunks, so you are not evaluating your progress based on whether you are like Ralston or Buddha. That may not happen for 40 years. And that's okay, you don't need that to enjoy your life.
</p>

<p>
	Tripping alone is my fave.
</p>

<p>
	125ug of LSD is about as powerful as 2-3g of dried mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Of course potencies can vary. A lot of LSD dosages are exaggerated. So if your source isn't good, a 125ug dose could actually be 70ug, which would be a weak trip. 125ug is a nice solid trip for me, but still very managable, still possible to walk around.
</p>

<p>
	At 300ug you probably wouldn't be able to walk.

For how long? How seriously are you doing them?
</p>

<p>
	Nothing else really matters. That is the key. Without serious practices you will never get enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Which teacher you listen to doesn't really matter if you don't have your practices down. And once you have your practices down you hardly need a teacher at all. That is the paradox of spiritual work. No one can do it for you.

But I did not say living on the beach like a bum. I said buying your own land and building a small shack. That is very doable if you save up some money. In Hawaii you can even live off the grid using solar panels and a rainwater catchment tank. Heating and A/C are virtually unnecessary there.
</p>

<p>
	See my Hawaii solo retreat blog videos.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you don't need to slave. Learning how to make money is not hard. There many ways to earn six figures per year and enjoy the process. You just need a vision to do it. You can't be doing it out of a desire to become a bum. Cultivate a desire to genuinely contribute to humanity. It is so much more fulfilling and pays well when properly designed.
</p>

<p>
	Learn some business, sales, and marketing skills. This is easily acheieved online through courses, workshops, audios, and books.
</p>

<p>
	You also need a plan for getting old. Your health will worsen and so will your ability to work. Healthcare ain't cheap. Don't take stuff like healthcare for granted. Without government you'd probably die in your 50's or 60's due to lack of healthcare, disablity, etc.

</p>

<p>
	The solution is to have it.
</p>

<p>
	This can be done easily with 1 hour using psychedelics. Which is precisely why they are such an important tool. Advanced practitions do not need psychedelics because they are aleady had many mystical experiences and are fully bought in. Newbies need psychedelics to show them what they are missing, what it would take them 10 years of harcore practice to glimpse.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the scientific way of finding God. They are totally empircal and easily replicatable. Clinically proven beyond any placebo or doubt. That's what makes them such useful tool. Never before in human history has there such an easy route to spirituality for newbies as with today's modern psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	This issue of doubting mysticism is utterly unneccessary in today's age. You might as well be doubting kangroos. If you doubt so much, why not just go to the zoo and pet a kangroo? It costs $30 and takes 1 hr.
</p>

<p>
	This is extremely ignorant thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Without government you would not even be able to live in a house in the forest because some gang would come slit your throat in the middle of the night or enslave you and seize your house. Without goverment you would not even have enough education to know what a country is! You would not have the internet, or property rights, you would not even know how to read or write, and many other things that you take for granted.
</p>

<p>
	Hawaii has very low property tax and the land there can be very cheap on the Big Island. You can buy plots of land for $30,000 and Hawaii weather is so nice you can basically live in a tent or a yurt and grow your own fruits and have chickens for eggs. Although food and construction in Hawaii costs about 1.5x more than mainland USA.
</p>

<p>
	But don't expect survival to be free. That is just ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than planning to be a leech, think of ways you can contribute to society. You will be much happier that way. It is not that hard for example to set up your own farm and meditation retreat center.

You must make a distinction between thinking this stuff and observation of actuality. Less thinking, more observation is necessary. Learn to sit and observe without emotionally reacting to anything at all. Stop judging things, stop fantasizing about the future or the past. Stop thinking about yourself. Stop thinking about your life. Just sit and observe the present moment. In the present moment there is nothing sad or bad.
</p>

<p>
	Start to notice when you are conscious vs when you are reacting emotionally to anything at all.

<p>
	Every 2 weeks is good as long as you're integrating the insights well. You will naturally not want to trip that often after a while because the trips should get too deep.

<p>
	Sounds like you're describing Samadhi: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi</a>
</p>

<p>
	Which is basically a mild version of nondual consciousness / mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	But you are only feeling the tip of the iceberg now. With more practice it will go much deeper. It can even go so deep that your body and the entire universe will disappear!
</p>

<p>
	It feels timeless because it is! Time is a concept created by the mind. When the mind is still for long enough, time will cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, every moment, every experience you've ever had, has been, and currently is, timeless.
</p>

Socialization is a skill set. Being intimate with women is a skill set. You need many hours of practice to get good at it, especially if you're shy, awkward, under-socialized, autistic, or very introverted.
</p>

<p>
	Put yourself into a lot more social situations/relationships and practice being very authentic, vulnerable, and intimate. Not sexually, but conversationally, emotionally, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse sex for intimacy.
</p>

<p>
	A little game you could play with yourself is to try to see how fast you can get real intimate with a total stranger. Like, walk up to a random person at a Starbucks and try to get intimate with them within 15 minutes of conversation. The trick is to do it without creeping them out. The first few times you try it you will come across weird and creepy. But through experience you will learn how to make it feel natural and positive for the both of you.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, and BTW, the whole trick to sleeping with women quickly is building intimacy quickly. You can do it within 1 hour of meeting her through lots of training. There are many tricks to speed this along, like being fully present, having very strong eye contact, speaking slowly, smiling, being warm and friendly, and touching her body frequently in a non-creepy manner.
</p>

<p>
	It's amazing when done right. But requires enormous practice unless you're "a natural." Which obviously you aren't otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation.
</p>

<title>What is ego-death?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/30266-what-is-ego-death/?do=findComment&amp;comment=351821</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	In the very moment of ego-death it is realized that your biological birth was just a story. It is realized that you are not a physical or a biological object, but an idea. This idea is eliminated, as though it never existed. Not only that, it becomes almost impossible to imagine how you ever thought you existed.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine life minus you.
</p>

<p>
	That's ego death. Everything stays the same. But you are missing!
</p>

<p>
	In other words, absolutely nothing changes! Just its always been, and how is right now!
</p>

<p>
	There is no you reading this sentence. The sense that there is a you reading this sentence is a fantasy. The end of this fantasy is ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	Ego-death is not an idea or a belief, it is state of consciousness. Accessing this state of consciousness requires intense concentration and stillness of the conceptualize mind. The conceptualizing mind is what is sustaining the fantasy of a you in the same way that a video game console sustains the appearance of Super Mario. If the console is unplugged, Mario disappears.
</p>

	I had a bad allergic reaction this week to the medicine (penicillin) for my sinus infection, which made me feel even worse and covered me in red rashy burning spots from head to toe. So video will be late, depending on when this clears up.

<title>Can someone explain art to me?</title>

<p>
	If you were awake you would realize the entire Cosmos is one epic work of art, from the galaxies to the viruses to the terrorists to the homeless person begging for coins on the side of the road.
</p>

<p>
	It's easier to ask, what isn't art?
</p>

<p>
	And the answer is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't see infinite artistry all around you it's because you're way too self-involved, hypnotized by satisfying your basic survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	The solution? Daily spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	Since YOU are God, you'd be worshipping yourself. That is okay as long as you're aware that you are worshipping yourself. Then it becomes like a cosmic masturbation session. And since you are the only thing in existence, all action is ultimately masturbation.

<p>
	Loving only those parts of reality which serve you or make you feel good.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, like I said, ego (you) is incapable of true love. True love requires eliminating ego. This requires some serious spiritual practices like Kriya yoga or self-inquiry or psychedelics.

<p>
	Since all is one and there is nothing but The Self, self-love is really the only kind of love.
</p>

<p>
	But this not the self you imagine you are. I am speaking of loving the entire universe unconditionally, especially all the evil stuff your self hates. That is true Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is not capable of real love. It only knows pseudo-love. Ego only cares about gets it needs met. That is not real love. That is egotism.

Taking antidepressants will only make things worse. It's like you're pressing the gas pedal and then slamming the parking break.
</p>

<p>
	What you need to do is become conscious of what this depressed feeling is about. Why it is happening? Not on a personal or psychological level but in an existential level. Why do you suffer at all? What is suffering about? What is sadness? Why purpose does it serve? Why are you creating it?
</p>

<p>
	In this work you must suffer consiously, otherwise you aren't really learning anything, you are just acting out unconscious egoic patterns. You could do that for 50 years and not come out any wiser or awake.

<p>
	Psychedelics have been used by all cultures for over 20,000 years for this purpose. So there is no disputing it. Not to mention the clinical studies.
</p>

<p>
	The distinction between objective and subjective does not exist. There is no such thing as subjective experience really. That is an illusion created by the ego. All "subjective experience" is actually Absolute Being if the ego is absent.
</p>

<p>
	Being is prior to proof. Truth is prior to proof. Proof is a concept, Truth is actuality.

The ego is not just gonna let you meditate. The more you push yourself to meditate the more you will overcome this defense mechanism. It will get better.
</p>

<p>
	One trick that works well for me is to meditate right after taking a nap.
</p>

<p>
	Also, meditate with your eyes open.
</p>

<p>
	You could also switch to Kriya yoga instead of meditation. It's very hard to fall asleep doing Kriya yoga even if you are sleepy because it involves more activity.

<title>Can't meditate without missing a single day</title>

</p>

<p>
	The question is, what do you want here?
</p>

<p>
	If you DO want to meditate every day but you are still struggling, that's a problem of self-discipline and integrity. You are making the commitment but then breaking your own word, which hurts your self esteem.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality usually requires developing hardcore discipline because otherwise the ego is too tricky and will never allow itself to be significantly undermined.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe try some strong determination sits. Bordem and extreme suffering during meditation is par for the course. Some of the greatest suffering I've ever had was during my solo meditation retreats. You cannot even imagine how much bordem and suffering happens there. Imagine bordem so bad it is literally killing you.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation is not all rainbows and peace. Meditation is hell from the ego's POV.
</p>

<title>Is the Dark Night of The Soul the same as Ego Death?</title>

My question is basically if you are progressively surrendering your ego, your emotions and the idea that you ever existed more and more but do not fully surrender/die, will you have to 'start over' in this die off process or is it just the final surrender you have to endure?

<p>
	The ego is relentless.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like reeling in a giant fish. You reel it in a few feet, then it runs out a few feet of line. A long tug of war ensues. If the fish is big enough it might even break the line and escape. You must slowly wear it down and the deliver the final blow.
</p>

<p>
	Any course of spirituality or development can become pathological.
</p>

<p>
	But it is also possible to land the fish. You must become a good fisherman.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If you are already into spirituality and nonduality why waste your time with Western philosophy? Why not invest that time deepening your spiritual practice?
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to do things just because other people are doing them. Be independent and don't do useless things with your life. Be highly selective with how you invest your time.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe spend your time studying something more practical.

It is the ego going through its final death throes. The ego can still bounce back with a vengeance and not complete the ego death.

</p>

<p>
	And how long has this been happening for you guys? When did this first start for you?

<p>
	It's hard to replicate this issue. Most of the time the site and forum load fine for me and others. But at the same time, for example on my mobile device, sometimes the site and forum fail to load.
</p>

<p>
	If you guys are still experiencing this problem could you please check the site and forum on multiples devices/connections and report back under what circumstances there are loading problems. Is this an intermittent thing?
</p>

<p>
	We're still trying to pin-point what the issue is.
</p>

<p>
	Please mention which device/OS/browser you're experiencing these issues under. For example I do not experience any issues on Windows Firefox or Windows Chrome. But I have been having issues on Android.

That requires decades of patient, serious practice.
</p>

<p>
	Now is the time to discipline yourself and start doing the practices.
</p>

<p>
	Re-calibrate your expectations. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

<title>The Impossible Nothingness Beyond Absolute Infinity</title>

Otherwise such questions and issues would not arise. Maybe you got a taste of it, but not the Full Monty. You need to go back and directly experience the Fully Monty.
</p>

<p>
	To say there is something beyond the Absolute is silly. The Absolute is Absolute and there is nothing beyond it because it is total.
</p>

<p>
	You are still holding Nothingness and Infinity as distinct things, which is a duality, which must be further collapsed, thus resolving this entire thread.
</p>

<p>
	What more is there to say if you are fully conscious of the Absolute? The Absolute is all there is. There is nothing but the Absolute.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Form is formlessness. Fromlessness is form.
</p>

<p>
	You are creating a duality out of nothing and infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Also, there is an infinite number of different systems of logic. So which ever logic you're using is arbitrary and relative. Absolute Infinity is not limited to logic because it created logic and holds an infinite number of logical systems within it, including all the stuff you deem illogical. The very distinction you create between logical and illogical means there is logical stuff and illogical stuff, which the illogical stuff being greater in quantity than the logical stuff.
</p>

<p>
	YOU are creating all of these distinctions between logic/illogic, infinity/nothing, life/death, self/other, true/false, etc. Ultimate nonduality is the realization that all of these distinctions are relative and impermanent.
</p>
