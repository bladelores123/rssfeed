<p>
	This is one of the best forum softwares available. Months of work went into setting it up and getting to function well. Lots of money was paid to customize it for our needs.

<p>
	Sidhhis do not remove all limits. Many limits still exist even if you are Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	It's very much like Neo in The Matrix. He learns to bend some of the rules but he is still constrained inside The Matrix. There are still many things he cannot do.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The key is how you understand the word "self". That's an extremely loaded word.
</p>

<p>
	If Self is understood in the widest possible sense as God, then all of life is self-imposed and self-created. But that does not mean you as a human body are not bound by constraints. You as God have imposed constraints on yourself which you do not know how to undo without physical death.
</p>

<p>
	For example, God constrained itself to be that bird, but that bird has no idea how to break the constraints of bird-ness. That is the whole point of death, to escape one's self-imposed constraints. But you can't have it both ways. You can't be alive in a body yet totally unconstrained. The body is a serious constraint. Life itself is a constraint. All form is limited, whether you're a rock, a tree, a bird, a kangaroo, Albert Einstein, Jesus, a DMT machine elf, or whatever. Whatever you are is what constrains you to be less than infinite.
</p>

<p>
	You are lost in the labyrinth of your own consciousness and your only escape is death.
</p>

<p>
	Is a bird outside in nature free or not?
</p>

<p>
	Seems free, but it is also extremely limited.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to understand the limits of a bird. It would be madness to try to ask the bird to solve calculus equations. Likewise it would be madness to try to ask a human to hatch an egg.
</p>

<p>
	An important part of growing up is learning your limits. Paradoxically acknowledging one's limits can be liberating, as one then surrenders to them and stops trying to act in some loftier, idealized way.
</p>

<p>
	Telling a child who's not suited for math to be good at math would traumatize the child and ruin his self-esteem because he will always feels inferior and not understand why. He will then blame himself for being defective or inadequate when in fact he's just suited to other things.
</p>

Humans exercise a tiny portion of God's Free Will.
</p>

<p>
	God has infinite Free Will. But also all of that Will is fully put towards actualizing Love. So in a weird strange loopy sense, God has no choice but to actualized Infinite Love. Then again, God freely chooses Infinite Love. But then again that is because God is so Infinitely Intelligent that it would never choose anything less. Which means it cannot be anything but Love. And so it goes, round and round in a vicious circle. As it must, because free will vs destiny is another one of those pesky dualities which must eventually collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: what is the difference between free will and destiny?
</p>

<p>
	Eventually you'll see that the two poles must meet and become one.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is analogous to the wave/particle duality in quantum mechanics. The true nature of light is that it's not one or the other but has features of both. Likewise with free will and destiny.

<p>
	This forum software is too tricky for even God to fix.
</p>

<p>
	The reason it, this is a 3rd party platform. Which means I can't just go in there and make changes to the code willy-nilly because the code needs to be upgradable, making changes very tricky as new upgrades override old changes.
</p>

<p>
	Basically we are stuck with the forum as-is with only minor cosmetic changes. And even those are problematic as they get overridden.
</p>

<p>
	And because the code is so complex, every new update introduces new bugs and problems even if it solves old ones. So there's no perfection in this game.
</p>

			Martin Ball writes in his Entheogenic Liberation: "because the client is moving into a state of unconditional love, the most common reaction is for individuals to scoop up the vomit in their hands and smear it over themselves, or even roll around in it. It’s messy, but profoundly beautiful, in its own way. You can literally see someone find love and acceptance for something they previously held as disgusting, shameful, unworthy, sinful, etc., and embrace and accept it in a state of absolute love. Such events tend to be deeply and profoundly healing for people, and moves them into deep acceptance of themselves and the world in a way that nothing else can."

<p>
	I've done over 70 psychedelic trips. Many very deep ones. Never once have I vomited. Totally unnecessary unless your body feels a need to do it. Healing happens regardless of vomiting.
</p>

<p>
	If you eat before the trip, you will almost certainly vomit on a heavy trip.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take Martin's method / attitude as the only one. It's one out of many. My trips tend to go differently than Martin's descriptions.

<p>
	You have to be very careful about biased selection.
</p>

<p>
	People certainly do become enlightened using those methods, but less than 1%. How do you account for the other 99% for whom the methods do not work? Just saying they are lazy is not a good enough explanation.
</p>

<p>
	The people who get enlightened using those techniuques are the ones who are already highly predisposed to it. You must be highly predisposed already just to do the practices seriously. Don't discount that.

<p>
	Shinzen Young proves my point. I do not consider him to have reached the deepest levels of consciousness, and he's been at it for 40 years.

<p>
	The Buddha very clearly also had supernatural talent. Those talents just lay dormant until he left to be a monk.
</p>

<p>
	Just the decision to give up his kingdom and become a full time monk was already an extraordinary act which could only have been made by a spiritually advanced person.
</p>

<p>
	Stories say that the Buddha tried various yogic methods and aced them all within a few years. Clearly a sign of supernatural talent.

<p>
	Be careful not to misunderstand my teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Life comes in a spectrum of spiritual abilities, from bacteria to kangroos to humans to aliens to God itself.
</p>

<p>
	Clearly a kangaroo is not going to fathom the depths of God no matter how much training. Why? Because of its physiological limits. It is too limited. Humans are better equipped. But still basically not good enough to fathom all of consciousness without augmentation. Humans lie all across the spectrum of consciousness. Some of us are totally retarded while others are Buddhas. This is certainly not explainable by lack of training, although training is often necessary to actualize our full potential. But what your full potential is, is highly constrained by physiology.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I am speaking about a lot more here than enlightenment. Consciousness is not merely about enlightenment. There is a width as well as a depth to it. Very few people explored the full width or depth alone, let alone both at once. So just saying, "But Leo, person X is enlightened" doesn't mean much. That is not a nuanced enough understanding of the spiritual terrain.

<p>
	I am talking about physiological brain differences and neurotransmitter differences which give people access to different realms of reality.

<p>
	The more I study and explore spirituality, the more convinced I am that spiritual talent plays a bigger and bigger role. I have met and talked with people who access crazy superhuman levels of consciously totally effortlessly without training. And these people can go deeper than those who practice for 40 years.
</p>

<p>
	It's quite unfair and outrageous. This is like a dirty giant secret of spirituality and meditation which no one tells you about because they want to believe we are all equal.
</p>

<p>
	Well, the truth is, we are nowhere close to equal.
</p>

<p>
	My experiments with psychedelics back this up. There are levels of consciousness so radical that you will never access them if you lack the proper neurotransmitters.

	Actually, if you study some Spiral Dynamics and if you work on your own consciousness, it becomes easy to assess the levels of consciousness of politicians. This allows you to size up people very quickly. You will come to recognize the common tropes of every stage of development. It can take as little as 5 minutes to size up a politician, especially if they are low in development.
</p>

<p>
	People are harder to size up once they get into Tier 2, but so few people are in Tier 2 that it's not a problem.
</p>

	Locking this because I have a feeling people will share things they will later regret and then pester Mods to delete it.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, this is a public forum. Don't post things you don't want to be public permanently. Some things are best kept to yourself, close friends, therapists, and lawyers.

<p>
	My Mom was loosely religious. She read me Bible stories when I was young. My Dad was scientific/amoral/atheist.
</p>

<p>
	My parents did not push any beliefs onto me. I was free to think as I liked.
</p>

<p>
	I was a pretty firm atheist by middle school because Christian metaphysics seemed silly. But in high school I realized that atheism too was a position and technically groundless and unjustified. But still I assumed it was right because the origin of God was not explained by religion as I knew it back then.
</p>

<p>
	I did not realize back then that it was possible for God to create itself.
</p>

<p>
	Now I am able to explain how Christianity & God really work to my Mom. And she basically understands. At least conceptually.
</p>

A person who has never awoken cannot resolve the issue of will because he assumes he is real. That you is illusory. You must discover the Universal You. Then we can talk.
</p>

<p>
	Ego assumes it is in control. But ego is illusory. So what then is actually in control? The Universal You.

<p>
	Devil is a tricky word. It can definitely be misunderstood by newbies. Must be careful with it.
</p>

<p>
	But it's also a fun word, it's provocative -- which can be good as times -- and once you understand what a devil actually is (by watching my What Is The Devil video) then it becomes a very powerful concept for making sense of the world.
</p>

<p>
	It's important for newbies reach a point in their development where they realize, "Holy shit! I really am a devil, aren't I?" That takes maturity and honesty to admit. People who are in denial that they are devils are the biggest devils. Admitting you're a devil is already to have solved half your problems. This is the chief reason why I like to call people devils. It forces them to confront the fact that the devil is not an external force but an internal one. The ego loves to see itself as a hero and an angel. So telling an ego that it's the devil is very shocking and destabilizing to it. It's like poking a hibernating bear in the eye with a pointy stick.
</p>

<p>
	Of course an even deeper understanding comes when you realize that all devilry is actually love.
</p>

	You definitely can't do it every day when you first start. You'll need weeks and even months in between for integration. It should take you at least 1 year to do those 10-20 trips.

<p>
	Again, it's not so simple.
</p>

<p>
	Notice you are demonizing Orange.
</p>

<p>
	What's missing in your assessment is a lack of compassion for ignorance, which is what devilry is. And also, in your demonization you fail to see the good and love of Monsanto. The people working in that company have families to feed. And their products help feed half the world with cheap food. Without Monsanto many millions of people would starve because crops would be more expensive to grow.
</p>

<p>
	The rule is this: anything you think is bad and evil is actually good and necessary when seen from a higher elevation.

	But relatvie truth isn't really a thing. Absolute Truth is the only thing there is. Everything you think is relative is actually Absolute.

<p>
	Aloneness is really no different than togetherness.
</p>

<p>
	As a human you can commune with others.
</p>

<p>
	If you were extremely conscious you'd realize all others are you.
</p>

<p>
	The ego gets depressed about it because it does not understand the beauty of God.
</p>

<p>
	Remember as a kid playing with imaginary characters in your mind? Well, that's what you're doing now when you think of Leo, but on a Cosmic scale.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry about it.
</p>

<p>
	Enjoy the illusion of togetherness. Then enjoy the truth of Aloneness. And bounce back and forth between them forever.
</p>

<p>
	IQ is not a proper measure of intelligence. You do not understand what intelligence really is. True intelligence is not IQ, nor anything close to IQ.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically, IQ is a very unintelligent way of conceiving of an measuring intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	True intelligence is one's ability to grasp larger and wider perspectives holistically while being fully aware that a perspective is just a perspective and never the truth. True intelligence is trans-rational, trans-linguistic, and unquantifiable.

<p>
	Argument has nothing to do with truth or understanding.
</p>

<p>
	I am not here to make arguments. I am here to guide people towards evolving their understanding of themselves and the world.
</p>

<p>
	Saying "you're stage Orange" is precisely the relevant issue here. Making arguments is a distraction. You cannot understand the points being made because your cognition is hijacked by the stage of development you're at. Stage Orange wants arguments for everything without realizing that arguments are beside the point. You need to recognize the limits of the Orange worldview rather than defending it. No argument will move you up out of Orange. Rather to move beyond Orange you must realize that arguments and logic are incomplete and limited. There are much better ways of understanding reality than logic or math or science. And this cannot be understood through argument or formal proof. Ego co-opts all arguments and proofs to maintain its worldview.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I do not look at the world through the filter of IQ at all. To me that is a narrow and foolish way of looking at people and societies.
</p>

<p>
	You are treating IQ as a fixed human quality but it isn't. The IQ of a society is like the wealth of a society. As a society grows it can raise the IQ of its members.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're caught up on the issue of IQ is because you're at a stage Orange level of cognitive development, so you're stuck on rationality and quantifying the world. Given your worldview, if a thing cannot be qualified or rationally grasped, it isn't real and does not exist. You're not yet developed enough to notice that this is very limited and distorted way of looking at the world. You've also filled your mind with IQ ideology by watching videos and reading Reddit or whatever, which now colors how you see the whole world. But you're not yet conscious enough to see that that's just one out of an infinite number of models and perspectives, and a very crude and narrow one at that.
</p>

<p>
	You're also not conscious yet of the socially-constructed nature of IQ scores and tests. You hold IQ as some kind of biological absolute, which it isn't. You might as well be arguing that poverty is a genetic trait. This would be to misunderstand the social and systemic causes of poverty.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to evaluate people, level of ego development is the best metric. And ego development is fully changeable with practice, effort, and improvements to society. It is not a genetic absolute in the way that having 10 fingers is.
</p>

<p>
	I seek to hang out with wise people who are conscious enough to realize that reality is too complex and subtle to be quantified. But since such people are rare, I have to settle for dealing with the narrow-mindedness of rationalism and scientism.
</p>

<p>
	Because it helps to explain things like Evangelicals who go to church every week for 20 years but have no idea what Jesus was actually pointing at and who behave the polar opposite of what Jesus taught.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to understand that mainstream religions have been corrupted by devilry for thousands of years.
</p>

<p>
	An Evangelical who thinks that God hates abortion and gays is precisely being a devil. God loves abortion and gays.

<p>
	Fairly normal. Remember, the ego is wrapped up with the body. It's a tangled mess. If the ego is not ready to surrender then anxiety and heart rate will increase as it tries to fight off the ego-death.

		</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>
	My first few trips I had a lot of fear and basically even a panic attack. But after many trips and ego deaths there is almost no fear now when tripping and heart rate hardly changes. It has become a smooth transition from duality & ego into nonduality & no ego.

		</ul>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't have that, but seems reasonable that that could happen. Your body probably has lots of emotional baggage stored in it from over the decades. It's good to let loose and shake/act that baggage out on psychedelics. That's a big part of the healing work. Sometimes the body has a lot of pent up energy which it wants to release or act out. Don't hold it back. Act it out without harming yourself or another.

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<ul>
			<li>
				Does the body fear go away after more practice?
			</li>
		</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It should because all fear is illusory in the end. Your probably underestimate how much practice is required. So keep practicing.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<ul>
			<li>
				Any recommendation on how to break through other than just add more material? 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I'd recommend trying some other psychedelics like mushrooms or LSD. They can help you to deal with various baggage which will then make you pure enough for 5-MeO-DMT. You cannot go into full God-consciousness without being sufficiently pure and free of psychological baggage.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<ul>
			<li>
				Does the body calm down if you do break through?
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A breakthrough can release a lot of pent up energy. The body can shake, move, vibrate, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than going straight for a breakthrough I'd spend more time exploring the psychedelic space on mushrooms and LSD. Get comfortable in the psychedelic space. Have some pleasant trips. Contemplate consciousness. Move around and stuff. Then try to go for a 5-MeO breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	I think you might be trying to go too quickly to the end. There is a lot to be gained from psychedelics even without a breakthrough. Trust that the breakthrough will come when you're ready for it. Dosage is not the most important thing, your level of purity and intent and tripping experience is more important.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, your first 10-20 trips are just like kindergarten. The key to success with psychedelics is patience and consistency. With practice the results will snowball into something amazing.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Consciousness can take the form of an infinite number of entities or beings which can interact with each other. But all of this is being imagined by Infinite Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	In the absolute sense, everything is one. In the relative sense, entities have their own existence. In this sense an alien or a spirit is no different than a human or an animal. The "physical" realm is only one out of an infinite number of realms populated by all sorts of beings.
</p>

<p>
	All these realms and beings are ultimately you. Just like in a dream.

<p>
	Corporations are necessary, a vital part of society, and they feed you many benefits and goods.

<p>
	The issue is one of right balance, not a blanket demonization of corporations. Corporations evolve in their level of development and consciousness just like humans.

<p>
	There's no contradiction at all.
</p>

<p>
	Christ is the son of God. Christ is God. You are the son of God. You are God. You are Christ. You are all humans. You are me. You invented Christianity and all other religions. The entire universe is happening in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The apparent contradiction arises because people do not properly understand Christ's teachings, because they are using ego to interpret them. A devil cannot read the words of Christ properly. Modern mainstream Christians are devils.

	Objective here means that a stage Yellow person has enough cognitive development to stand outside his own bias. This is only possible at Tier 2 and up. Tier 1 minds are not aware of how self-bias warps their perception of reality. Nor do they appreciate the importance of transcending self-bias.
</p>

	I don't understand why 4 years of work hasn't improved your life. Why is the struggle so bad?
</p>

<p>
	Remember, this whole journey of self growth is supposed to be enjoyable. Don't do it because someone said you have to do it. Do it because it's what you're interested in naturally. What else are you gonna do?
</p>

<p>
	It might also be a good idea to take a break from personal development for a while. Come back to it later. Go enjoy life a bit. Follow what you're naturally passionate about, not some lofty ideal.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Secondly, the lobbyist corruption problem is enormous and sneaky in the US. Corporations give millions of dollars of donations to influence elections and policies. It is legalized bribery via corporate PACs, fundraisers, think tanks, donations, gifts, lunches, dinners, golf, etc, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And it does not stop there. Corporate lobbyists actually get hired into government and when they leave government they go right back into the corporation and consult them on all the best ways to lobby government. It's the revolving door. Right now Trump has appointed the biggest lobbyists to head the regulating agencies like the Department of Education, the EPA, the FCC, etc. Their goal is specifically to dismantle regulations on their industries.
</p>

<p>
	Ajit Pai, the guy who killed net neutrality was Verizon's biggest lobbyist against net neutrality. Now he runs the FCC. It's absurd. The biggest oil company lobbyist now runs the EPA.

<p>
	That is a big problem.
</p>

<p>
	Although it is possible to lobby without paying money or using other corrupt ways.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really stop groups from lobbying government. That's part of democracy. But they should not be able to influence using money or other gifts.

<p>
	No. About 10 minutes is sufficient. After about 10 mins the substance will be fully absorbed and you are free to move around. I usually lay prone for the first 10 minutes and then sit up as the trip starts to really kick in.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend sitting upright during the trip so you are not disoriented. With eyes open.

<p>
	For fuck's sake no! That is God!
</p>

<p>
	The solution you're looking for is LOVE! Practice being more loving towards yourself and others.
</p>

<p>
	Replace guilt with love. Love is God! Not ego.
</p>

<p>
	You are being egotistical when you judge yourself so harshly. Treat yourself with kindness.
</p>

<p>
	Doubt is good at the beginning of this journey. But at some point you gotta drop doubt and replace it with absolute faith in Love.

</p>

<p>
	But drop the IQ debating points. You should be above such arguments. IQ comparisons are a red herring.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, unity through individuation is important. Trying to erase all differences is not the solution. There needs to be a very delicate balance between individual autonomy and collective unity.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is that there are no easy black and white answers to complex systemic global challenges.

<p>
	I suspect that quite a few philosophers had small glimpses of oneness, but not full blown enlightenment or God-realization, so their understanding was muddled and weak.
</p>

<p>
	It took me many awakenings to finally reach a point where my understanding of it is rock solid and free of dualistic confusion. There's just too much there to grasp it all in one fell swoop. It's like trying to eat an elephant.

<p>
	God is fully omniscient and unlimited.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that God's Will is that individual beings exhibit their will. God's ultimate choice was that you make your own choices. Since you ARE God, you're creating reality as you go along with your choices.
</p>

<p>
	God isn't merely aware of every possiblity of the game, God IS the whole shebang.
</p>

<p>
	Knowledge, awareness, and being are ultimately one. Anything you experience, God is. When you get horny, that's God experiencing horniness. When you feel pain, that's God experiencing pain.

</p>

<p>
	Your worldview may not be racist, but it is fundamentally ethnocentric. Your worldview is that you see the world in terms of races and cultures which cannot get along. Notice that your position is coming from a place of FEAR and LACK. That has nothing to do with truth, it's a limited, constructed worldview, and this worldview is serving your survival as a self.
</p>

<p>
	If those immigrants were your own mother, you'd sing a different tune.
</p>

<p>
	IQ is a silly metric. To make any arguments based on IQ difference is absurd because IQ depends upon the country's infrastructure and level of development, not racial differences. And even if there is an IQ difference, so what? A nation has people of all levels of IQ in it. You cannot keep all the low IQ people in some sealed off part of the world. Low IQ people are all part of our situation on this planet. Also, just because someone is high IQ does not make them an angel. There are many high IQ people who are ruining this country with financial exploitation. IQ is not equal to moral development or consciousness. Which is why it's such a bad metric.
</p>

<p>
	The world is going to be a multicultural place no matter how much you resist it, so might as well embrace it and get used to it. It already is multicultural. Immigration is the result of multiculturalism. When you create boundaries between countries, nature will obviously work to blur those boundaries. So the irony of what is happening is here is: humans invented all these imaginary ethnic and national boundaries, and now the forces of nonduality are telling you: not so fast! Those boundaries cannot remain permanent because no boundaries in the universe are permanent.
</p>

<p>
	The logic that you're using is that same kind of logic that people used against the Jews, Irish, Italians, and other people who immigrated to the USA throughout history. These Europeans were considered dirty, uneducated, non-White, and that they would corrupt society. Now it's totally obvious such logic is silly. Your logic is warped by fear of "other".
</p>

<p>
	No one is saying that we should have Wahhabist communities in the USA. And to conflate Latin American asylum seekers with Wahhabists is absurd. Again, coming from fear.
</p>

<p>
	Immigration has been a part of American culture since the very beginning. So to say that somehow these different races and cultures cannot get along is a projection of your own fear and also historically inaccurate. They CAN get along, but certainly not if you have an ethnocentric worldview which believes that different races cannot get along. By believing it won't work, you manifest it. To get along, you gotta stop seeing the world as all these different groups and start seeing the fundamental humanity of all humans. You also need to stop thinking so negative of people with lower IQs. As if IQ somehow determines a person's worth.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate reason immigration is happening is because you cannot have a wealthy country next to a poor country. Nature will try to equalize that differential until both countries are equalized. Don't forget that much of American wealth and success is built directly off of exploitation of poor countries. The US manipulates Latin American countries to exploit them financially. Then when asylum seekers come, that's directly related to American foreign policy around the world.
</p>

<p>
	It's all interconnected.
</p>

<p>
	Your fundamental argument is that people are just too different to get along. But all of these people are on the same planet. So whether you like it or not, we have to learn to get along or we will kill each other. Learning how to get two different people to get along is our whole job! You cannot have a global economy as we do while also segregating people. What you're basically talking about is segregation. Your same logic was used to oppose the integration of black kids into white schools in the 60's. The whites' argument was identical to yours: "We aren't racists! All we're saying is, if you integrate dumb black kids into our elite white schools, this will ruin our schools. And they will get into fist fights because they are too different." Yeah! That's called segregation, LOL. That's ethnocentrism and selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	All of this is collective ego 101. We've seen it happening in human history from the dawn of civilization. Nothing new in this logic.
</p>

<p>
	None of those folks were awakened except the Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	It's very rare for a Western philosopher to be awakened.
</p>

<p>
	Heraclitus, Plotinus, Berkeley, and Hegel were some of the few I think were awakened.
</p>

<p>
	Buddha-nature/Buddha-mind is God. Nirvana is God.

<title>Is a Guru Essentially a Life Coach</title>

<p>
	No, life coaching is a very specific thing, sort of like therapy.
</p>

<p>
	A guru is something distinct from that. A guru is guiding you to awakening. A life coach is not. The method of guidance is also different.
</p>

<p>
	Coaching is mostly done over the phone. A guru is mostly face to face.

<p>
	I would not trust Jung as a source of deep authority about matters of awakening because I do not consider him to be deeply enlightened, regardless of his other valid insights and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	The "ego" is a bit tricky and clumsy here. We have to be careful how we define that term because it can refer to various things depending on who's using it.
</p>

<p>
	From my experiences, the sense of human sense is a total illusion. The most enlightened people should have difficultly even distinguishing themselves from another human or animal because their consciousness is so universal. At my highest levels of consciousness I could not even understand how I ever thought I was born as a human. It just didn't make sense because it was so patently false & imaginary. And this was definitely not a pathological state. This is the most beautiful and profound thing ever.
</p>

<p>
	What happens at the highest levels of nondual consciousness is that the ego collapses and you become the entire Universe. Every movement of the Universe is your movement and Will. Every molecule in your hand is materialized into being by your Will (God's Will). For example, I once picked up a stray black hair from an ex-girlfriend on my carpet and I was fully conscious of how I designed that hair using my Infinite Intelligence, and how I designed my ex-girlfriend. But this cannot be communicated in any linear fashion whatsoever. The only one who can know these things is God. You must be God to understand it. A human cannot understand it.
</p>

<p>
	I think becoming God cannot be a disease if you do it properly. There can probably be many pathologies along the way as the ego-mind refuses to fully surrender and integrate.
</p>

<p>
	Probably the biggest danger at this point is that you can become so conscious that you just leave the body and merge into total undifferentiated Infinity. Maha-Samadhi. But I think this would be a conscious choice, so you newbies don't worry about it.
</p>

	I actually don't know the exact species of mushrooms I took. But it also happens on synthetic psychedelics like LSD or 4-AcO-DMT.

<p>
	Distorting the visual field are what psychedelics are best at.

	Yeah, apparently Jesus had quite a temper as a young teen. If the stories are to be believed.

<p>

<p>
	That makes perfect sense to me. He'd have to literally be God, tapped into enough of God's mind to be able to reimagine a person's disease. I suspect it would be sort of like hacking into the central database of a massively multiplayer game and erasing a couple of files, so that that change propagates to all the client machines.
</p>

<p>
	It would require an enormous amount of consciousness. It would be very dangerous if such things were allowed to anyone but the purest of souls. Your intent has to be totally pure and selfless. At that point it is not right to even call it your intent or your will, it becomes the intent of the Universe and that is why it would end up working -- because it really isn't a personal wish at that point, it is the very creative force which spawns "physical reality".
</p>

<p>
	This is definitely way beyond your run of the mill Neo-Advaita enlightened people. They are not conscious enough to do such things.
</p>

<p>
	I also suspect that Jesus may not have been human. Giving him access to another league of spiritual powers.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Not so much on 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Although during my highest dose trip I had such a massive heart opening and kundalini activation that it shot out of my fingertips like invisible Jedi force lightning and pealed the skin on my fingertips, which remained pealed and cracked for a few weeks and took time to heal. It was a very overwhelming experience. Too much God too fast.
</p>

<p>
	On DPT, however, I have more visionary abilities. Like I described in some of my recent blog videos, I experimented with performing healing on myself and even healing the collective consciousness of mankind as a whole. DPT is a better tool for that. I'm still trying to figure out how it work. Seems like performing miracles is possible with it.
</p>

<p>
	I suspect that to be able to preform miracles one needs to have or somehow develop extraordinary, superhuman visionary capacity more so than just pure nondual consciousness. These seem to be distinct aspects of consciousness which can be developed independently, or perhaps together synergisticly.
</p>

<p>
	I think it may be possible to actually tap into the collective consciousness of an entire species and modify the trajectory of its evolution through one's will. Of course at this level of consciousness it's not your human will, it is the Will of God at work creating the entire universe. It's very hard to explain because it is utterly nonlinear and beyond words or any kind of human logic. Ordinary laws of cause and effect don't apply there. I have much more exploring to do there to make sense of how it works. Seems promising so far. Of course no one will believe it. It's hard to believe even as you're doing it. To the human mind it seems nuts and impossible.
</p>

<p>
	My theory is this: if you want to perform a miracle which objectively registered in other people's mind, you have to actually tap into the collective consciousness of all sentient beings and make the change at that level. Because the physical world has to be consistent across individual minds. You can't just change a thing for one mind but not another.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I spend most of my time alone. If I worked at Starbucks, yeah, maybe I'd have to hide it. I'm fortunate in that regard.
</p>

<p>
	Most days there are moments of such deep love and profound understanding that tears cannot be stopped.
</p>

<p>
	For me this whole thing is not just about the state of consciousness but the profound understandings that pour nonstop. Reality is understood at higher and higher levels. Everything becomes so interconnected. I can watch a guy flick his cigarette out of the car driving at 40 miles per hour, catch a quick glimpse of the cigarette as it bounces off the asphalt and realize that in that cigarette butt lies an entire universe, as deep and infinite as the celestial universe our astronomers explore. Stuff like that all day long.
</p>

<p>
	I think there's quite a range of variability in how people experience nonduality. For some it will be more heart-centered and feeling-based, for others more head-centered and intellectual, for other more visual, for others more visionary, for others more wacky & paranormal, etc.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I wouldn't say I feel it. I would phrase it as: I understand my body is the imagination of God. Sometimes I look at my hands and see them as magic. Most of the day, however, when I'm on autopilot, I lose sight of the magic, simply residing in the mundaneness of everyday human life.
</p>

<p>
	There are moments throughout the day where I stop and consciously reconnect with the magic. Like, "Oh yeah! These hands are the hands of God!" But then I usually go back into functional living.
</p>

<p>
	I know I can deepen this a lot more with more work.
</p>

<p>
	I still need more work to calm the body and mind down to be still for long periods of time. I'm not so good at that because I am constantly bombarded with wisdom. Wisdom and insights pour all day long. I run out of energy just verbalizing them all for the benefit of mankind. I feel it is my duty to be a mouthpiece for God's infinite wisdom. And I enjoy it.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's hard to say. For me, the awakening experienced on 5-MeO-DMT represents the purest form of nondual consciousness. I'm not sure what it takes to turn that into an unbroken state. It's total God-mode. You would be a walking God with that level of consciousness and you would transform the entire planet simply through the power of your presence. You could look a charging elephant in the eye and get him to bow before you. It is truly superhuman.
</p>

<p>
	At that level I could no longer teach verbally. My teaching would be to walk around town blessing crowds of homeless people, children, and throngs of followers, and performing miracles. Grown men would be brought to tears from the radiance of my love. Birds would land in my hand.
</p>

<p>
	People would write myths about it a 1000 years later.
</p>

<p>
	I am nowhere near that level.
</p>

<p>
	There are degrees of it. The highest degrees of it are certainly not my perpetual state. At the highest degrees it would be hard to walk.
</p>

<p>
	I'm generally aware that everything I'm looking at is God. But I also have many moments throughout that day where I'm just running on autopilot and sucked into the dualistic world.
</p>

<p>
	I certainly cannot sustain a 5-MeO-DMT peak. That level of consciousness is just off the hook. The physical body struggles to cope with it.

<p>
	Yes, of course psychedelics cause your visual field to melt. That's what you call distortions. This is mostly a distraction. It's a cool effect but not too spiritually significant. Focus on probing the luminosity instead.
</p>

<p>
	What's really happening is that the psychedelic is lubricating your mind, softening it up from its usual concrete stranglehold. As the mind softens up like warm clay, it becomes malleable, wavy, and flexible.
</p>

<p>
	Taking a psychedelic is like melting an ice cube from solid to liquid to gas.
</p>

<p>
	As your mind becomes more liquid your visual field starts to melt. It becomes unstable, giving you access to Infinite Imagination. This is why you start seeing faces in the carpet and so forth. As the mind becomes more fluid your literally start to materialize your thoughts. If you think of demons you will start to see demon faces in the carpet, and so forth.
</p>

	Funnily enough, I have been resisting stickying this because I feel that most people ignore stickied threads over time.
</p>

<p>
	Life is so counter-intuitive that stickying a thread makes it less visible.

</p>

<p>
	If you probe deeper into what that luminosity actually is, you'll discover it's pure Emptiness, Nothingness, or Void. That is the Groundless Ground or Buddhamind. Your Original Face.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms make you very aware of this Void. Basically all psychedelics do.
</p>

<p>
	Technically it's not a sensation. It is Truth or Pure Consciousness. You gotta probe deeper into it next time you trip. Contemplate: What is this luminosity? while you trip. You will eventually realize that it's totally empty and indistinct. This is pure existence devoid of form. This is the Absolute Formless, the Godhead.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, this luminosity is present right now in your direct experience! The Now IS pure formless luminosity!
</p>

<p>
	So you don't even need to be tripping on mushrooms to access it. It's always here and NOW. Mushrooms just make it easier to notice.
</p>

	You gotta find some ways to enjoy life. All of this spiritual work is ultimately just a way of learning how to enjoy life. It's not about living in some cave and being a hardcore monk. That is only done for a temporary period as a means to an end.
</p>

<p>
	You can practice enjoying life right now. You don't have to finish your enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Structure your life in ways that make you feel good about yourself. I don't mean shooting up heroin or partying every night. I mean more simple pleasures, like the pleasures of reading a good book, cooking a nice meal, going fishing on the weekend, going for a road trip, listening to some good music, practicing some cool hobby, etc.
</p>

<p>
	There are many ashrams around the world. In India, in Costa Rica, and elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try to find a more laid back job which is either more enjoyable to do or gives you more free time. When you have a business that you enjoy doing, life becomes a lot sweeter.
</p>

<p>
	I spend a lot of time on my work, but I love it so it rarely feels like work. That's the key to work. You gotta do something you find meaningful.
</p>

			<i>All of them </i>say they want:  complete amnesty + citizenship for everyone + free medical benefits.
		</p>

		<p>
			That means no consequences - and effectively - open borders.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, that is NOT open borders. Our borders are enforced and always have been enforced, even under liberal presidents. The threat of deportation and other problems are always there for illegals.
</p>

<p>
	Amnesty + citizenship is the same issue. Amnesty was done under Regan and even many conservatives are okay with amnesty as long as the border is enforced.
</p>

<p>
	The problem of amnesty isn't really a liberal one, it's a practical one. What do you do with 10 million+ illegals who've been here for years? Deporting them all would be unworkable, expensive, damaging to the economy, and cruel. So that leaves us with 2 options: 1) do nothing, 2) amnesty.
</p>

<p>
	Amnesty usually involves paying fines and making other contributions to society.
</p>

<p>
	Illegals pay sales tax, local tax, and payroll taxes while not receiving social security, Medicare, or other benefits. So to say that they will get free medical benefits is not quite right. And if illegals are given amnesty, they then pay into the system just like everyone else, so their medical benefits are not free.
</p>

<p>
	And finally, it's not like you have a solution to illegals coming to the USA. They will come anyway. Most illegals are visa overstays from airports, not border crossings. No wall is going to stop it. Walls will just be climbed over or under, or flown around. So the problem of illegals will remain.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to stop illegals then the only workable solution is to provide massive help to their home countries to boost their governments and economies. That would be a great long-term strategy. The US could loan those countries money similar to the Marshall Plan for rebuilding Europe.
</p>

<p>
	The only other option is a heavily militarized border like North/South Korea. But that's quite barbaric. Policing that entire border rigorously would waste more money than it's worth.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a serious misunderstanding of Spiral Dynamics. SD stages are not good or evil. It's just relative degrees of awareness and development.
</p>

<p>
	The reason some people don't like SD is if they find themselves low on the scale and then judge themselves that that is bad and unacceptable. But SD never said you are bad for being at a lower level.
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing evil about saying that person X is in 3rd grade while person Y is in 12th grade.
</p>

<p>
	Development Psychology and Spiral Dynamics help us understand one another better. It's the exactly opposite of calling people evil.

<p>
	No major left-wing political candidate is advocating open borders. This is some bogeyman the right wing created.
</p>

<p>
	Also, applying for asylum is LEGAL.

	I have no problem with border enforcement as long as it's humane.

</p>

<p>
	Think of it as nothing changes visually. Just awareness increases and sense of self collapses or expands.
</p>

<p>
	It feels like being hyper-present. You become so present & aware that you literally see through the substance of physical reality. What once looked physical now seems like a hologram. Physical objects appear empty, like a hallucination or a mirage. You can see them still, but they lack reality. It can also feel like the air got sucked out of the room. Everything becomes crystal clear and luminous.
</p>

<p>
	It also feels like divinity and pure magic.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When doing a retreat, be crystal clear about what you're doing and what the parameters are.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be jerking off in your Mom's basement and calling that a retreat. A retreat is when you're meditating/inquiring 24/7. Or in the case of psychedelic retreats it's back to back days of deep tripping.

This is very substantive and important stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with such sloppy false equivalencies.
</p>

<p>
	If you think that what I'm doing here is just the ideological opposite of what Fox News is doing, you've got much to learn and you are contributing to the problem.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a topic is polarizing and emotional does not make it any less important. In fact it's all the more important because people do not know how to think properly about polarizing issues. They tend to either take one side or do a sloppy false equivalency, both of which are dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	Ignoring poltical questions is not an option if we care about consciousness. Actualized.org could not exist under a regressive government. When monsters come to power they tend to silence and repress the intellectuals and wisest people.

<p>
	Your position is not quite racist but it is enthocentric. Small minds think ethnocentricly. What you're doing is defending an identity you constructed. But you want to deny it. But I am pointing it out to you that you are in denial about it. But the nature of denial is that you will deny that you are in denial. So here we are. You are stuck in Tier 1. I am trying to communicate to you from Tier 2. But you do not understand Tier 2 because you have an enormous amount of consciousness work to do. And of course you do not want to do it, so you make this about me. If your mind succeeds in making this about me, then you won't have to grow. Which is just perfect for your ego's survival.
</p>

<p>
	Do not underestimate the sophistication with which your own mind is tricking you. Nothing your mind says can be trusted. Your mind is a blind survival machine and it spins your ideology.

<p>
	I address libertarianism a lot because no mater how extreme or moderate it is, the people who hold such an ideology are very common today. Especially stage Orange young males. They get trapped by this ideology because they have a deep lack of experience and understanding of political history and they want to assert their individualism come what may.
</p>

<p>
	I have yet to find one libertarian who has a keen sense of history or how government works. It's an ideology based on ignorance. It is thoroughly ahistorical.

<p>
	Mindlessness is relative thing. People here are way more mindful, on average, than the general population or Trump voters.
</p>

<p>
	The important difference is that people here are interested in being more mindful. Trump supports are generally not.
</p>

<p>
	Being ignorant or mindless is not so bad. What's really bad is being aggressive and stubborn in one's ignorance and mindlessness. And Trump is promoting a culture of aggressive mindlessness & selfishness. People actually feel righteous about being so ignorant. This is a dangerous and pathological development which must be challenged.

<p>
	What you're overlooking is that without a bureaucracy there cannot be a highway at all.
</p>

<p>
	A highway is a very complex thing. It requires complex social structures to exist. You cannot just build a highway in the middle of the jungle and have it work. Highways only exist in advanced, complex, modern societies.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course! That's the whole point! Not privileged but you must develop through the lower stages by meeting and integrating various low level needs.
</p>

<p>
	The fruits of Blue & Orange are definitely necessary. The problem is that Blue & Orange are becoming pathological to the point where the whole planet is in danger.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with a desperate homeless person is precisely that he cannot take any higher level concerns seriously because he's so needy he can only care about himself. So the solution is help elevate as many such people as possible by helping them to meet their basic needs, so they stop being desperate. That desperation is making them unconscious and unable to consider larger ecological issues.
</p>

<p>
	Ecological concerns are not a privilege. If the planet's ecology crashes, millions of the poorest and more desperate people will die. It's already happening, you're just not aware of it because you haven't studied these issues seriously enough.
</p>

<p>
	Drop your ideological opposition and maybe you can learn something here and advance to a whole new level of understanding.

<p>
	I didn't say he was enlightened. I said God-like. God-like comes in many degrees and is relative to one's era and culture.
</p>

<p>
	Also don't conflate Spiral stages with enlightenment. Many Zen masters in Japan or yogis in India are enlightened but only at stage Blue of the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to be enlightened to be a good #2 leader. Bernie Sanders is a good example. He's far from enlightened but he is more God-like (i.e., selfless & compassionate) than most politicians of his time.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But that's the sick twisted irony of this whole situation. Trump is financially irresponsible so electing him reduces economic stability in the same way Bush crashed the economy with deregulation & tax cuts.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation hurt many of the poorest people.
</p>

<p>
	The people who vote for Trump are mindless precisely in the sense that they have an economic ideology which ends up shooting itself in the foot. They assume that unfettered capitalism will solve all problems (as their ideology promises them), but this just isn't the case because society and the economy are complex systems which work in counter-intuitive ways.
</p>

<p>
	People do not vote for Trump due to economics. They vote for him based on their gut feeling, because they resonate with his values and level of consciousness. Economics is a retroactive rationalization. The economy was improving and doing well under Obama. This is irrelevant to the Trump voter because economics is just an excuse. What drives them is their stage of cognitive and moral development. Don't let their retroactive rationalizations fool you. They themselves do not actually understand why they voted for Trump or are attracted to him. What they tell themselves are pleasant stories.
</p>

<p>
	It is very important to see through these stories and excuses.
</p>

<p>
	The poorest people actually voted more for Hilary than Trump. Trump's voters are in it for the culture war. Which is why Trump and Fox News are always playing up the culture war. Trump voters do not have a keen sense of policy. A vote for Trump is really a way for people who detest liberalism to spit in the eye of liberals. That's the whole emotional appeal of Trump. Trump is a "fuck you" to the "global elites". But of course the sick irony is that Trump is the fattest, greediest global elite there is because he loves money, sex, fame, power, and success no matter the cost.
</p>

<p>
	Poor people voting for a man who has a golden toilet in his house and lost $400 million dollars of daddy's money is the devil's sickest joke.
</p>

			The moment I read this, it finally clicked... I realized that real visionary leadership is leadership that inspires other people to think critically and more consciously. That’s what creates real collective change. Motivating individuals that empower them to take on greater concern than just their petty life...
		</p>

		<p>
			I think this just helped me clarify my life purpose.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To help you deepen that insight, there are basically two kinds of leadership:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Rally people towards selfishness using fear
	</li>
	<li>
		Rally people towards selflessness using love
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	It really is that simple. Of course there are many degrees of both. Most leadership is somewhere in the middle. Exceptional leadership is #2. And #2 is so rare precisely because is cannot be faked. The leader must lead by example by himself being selfless and loving, which is impossible for a big ego to do. Which is why human history is filled with examples of such terrible leaders. But also a few exceptional ones. Exceptional #2 leaders become deified as gods. Because they literally must be God-like to lead that way. Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, Muhammad, Gandhi, MLK, etc. Unconscious people are incapable of such leadership nor are they capable of electing such people into positions of power. Those who get elected tend to be the most ambitious, ruthless, and manipulative ones. Rarely a selfless person will get elected, but he will quickly be demonized and kicked out of power by the selfish people who feel threatened by his selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	The thing that selfish people hate the most is displays of selflessness. Because it makes them look bad.
</p>

	Listening to podcasts is not a retreat.
</p>

<p>
	A retreat is a serious undertaking. Don't turn it into a mockery. Otherwise you're fooling yourself by telling yourself you did a retreat when you were really just driving in your car and listening to podcasts.
</p>

<p>

	I did 13 trips over 13 consecutive days. By the end of it I was so deep mindfucked that fear of doing it became irrelevant.

	It's normal to get a bit of anxiety prior to taking the substance. But once it's took, then just enjoy the ride.

<p>
	At certain levels of consciousness fear becomes untenable.
