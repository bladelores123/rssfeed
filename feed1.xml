It is a feature of Absolute Consciousness. This won't make sense without a deep awakening to what metaphysical Love is. It's a hell of an awakening. We are not talking about love as the opposite of hate, or romantic love here, but Absolute Love -- the very being of God.
</p>

<p>
	Try some psychedelic and see for yourself what Love really is.

But this will only be effective if you're already familiar with many of the paths. It won't work so well if you only know a few paths, as your choices will be limited. It's a good idea to study the pros and cons of various paths. Then decide.
</p>

<p>
	Most people just stumble into one path randomly by accident. They don't shop around.

	I can't tell you how I know the things I know because what we're talking about here is too deep to explain in a simple linear sequence of words.

	As someone who studies this stuff professionally, I'm here to give you guidance about things you probably have never deeply studied or have direct experience of. That's the whole point of a good teacher, to show you things you aren't yet aware of. This does not make the teacher infallible, and yet he must still teach. So here we are. Make of it what you will.

<title>Who's Interested In Conscious Politics?</title>

<p>
	I'm planning some videos on a new topic I'm calling "Conscious Politics". It's a Tier 2 approach to politics and government which aims to go beyond the left/right divide.
</p>

<p>
	Well, interested or not, it's coming, so brace yourselves! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> Some of it will be controversial & radical, but also inspiring. If you lean conservative some of the things which will be said you will probably deny and react against. But there will also be critiques of liberal ideologies too.
</p>

<p>
	It's a tricky topic to discuss because it tends to polarize and distract people from doing the inner work. And yet it must be discussed. So we're damned if we do and damned if we don't.
</p>

			So I’m working at this job this summer that happens to be based of A LOT of Mormons. Besides the fact that they repress every swear word with “fudge” and “shizz” (granted - a lot of these guys are in their late 20s), I learned about this thing they do called “durfing” (for dick surfing). It’s a loophole they find for avoiding sex where they just dry hump for hours until they nut. The loopholes the mind comes up with to meet its needs are astounding.

	Enlightenment does not mean what you think it means. It prescribes no specific ways of behavior. Enlightenment is realization of one's true nature. What one does afterwards is a whole nother matter. Survival needs are still operative.

<p>
	I sense that you are taking a judgmental attitude on this whole topic. This clouds your understanding of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	If a guy is conscious of his true nature but sexually abuses his students, I have no problem calling him enlightened because enlightenment is a very specific thing which does not hinge on moral actions. You must be careful not to equate enlightenment with some idealized notion of being Christ-like.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind there are many degrees of enlightenment, many degrees of embodiment of it, and many stages & lines of development which are all independent of enlightenment. This is a very complex topic which is understood by very few spiritual teachers.
</p>

<p>
	This is why in many of the best spiritual communities/ashrams/monasteries sex is simply not allowed and vows of celibacy are taken.
</p>

<p>
	Of course that still doesn't fully resolve the problem as sexuality is too strong a force to simply be suppressed. Sexual tension will still run high and it can get expressed in very creative ways. Buddhist monks commonly have sex with each other by rubbing their genitals between the other's legs. Technically it ain't "sex". Lol
</p>

<p>
	You have to really appreciate how powerful of a force the sex drive is. It's basically impossible to just drop it. And sex leads to lots of drama and ego games. I would never expect any teacher or human being to be "above it".
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are healthy and unhealthy ways of expressing it.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, I mostly mean just sleeping with lots of people without going exclusive with any one.
</p>

<p>
	Abuse of power is a very relative thing and difficult to adjudicate. You'd have to be more specific by what that actually means. Yes, I suspect he does use his fame/status to help his own survival, which you could call an abuse of power. But then again, this is what survival is all about. This is how most people live. Famous people often use their fame to get easy sex.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not sure why there would be prostitution or even if this activity is a crime in his country. You'd have to specify what prostitution means in his case. Is he forcing women to have sex for money? Is he paying women to have sex with him? That seems farfetched. If he is, obviously that's a problem.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because it's clear he has some degree of enlightenment. What degree is hard to say. Probably not the highest degree.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really teach the things he's teaching without some degree of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	It's important not to conflate enlightenment with moral perfection. These are very distinct things.

Not suspicious of his enlightenment -- I think that's legit -- but shadow issues. This is very common. Loose sexual activity tends to be extremely common in small spiritual communities. It's so common I don't even blink when I hear of it. I just expect it as a given.
</p>

<p>
	If a woman is  going to sleep with Mooji, it's pretty obvious what the end result will be. It would be silly to assume he'd marry you and stay true to you given all the women who worship him. The problem is, when women worship him and then sleep with him, they only become even more attached to him and by that point they cannot help it. They will naturally get clingy, fall in love with him, but he's probably not gonna restrict who he sleeps with because at his level of consciousness it doesn't matter from his POV. And then this ends up emotionally hurting lots of women who fall in love with him because they want to make him go exclusive. It's every female worshiper's dream to be the one who gets Mooji all to herself.

Poof can be thoughts, word, speech, action maths, logic, English anything. It could be any form. You mention mathematical formula of proof. Proof can be consciousness. So proof, Truth, and any other qualities exist equally at the same time. When you proof that you exist your consciousness will make know that you exist as the time. 
		</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making here is you're stretching the meaning of the concept of "proof", extending it to mean truth, thereby rigging your argument to win by definition. If you do that, then yes, you can say everything is proof. But this is a sloppy way of thinking which lacks nuance. Proof is precisely not everything. Proof is a concept designating a specific type of thing. It is not equivalent to truth. As a simple example, if someone actually committed a murder, that would be truth, but the proof of it is something else. DNA evidence, a bloody knife, video camera footage, verbal testimony from eye-witnesses, etc all of that is proof, but none of it is identical to the murder itself. To say that the murder itself is the proof is a sloppy way of thinking which fails to understand what the notion of "proof" is supposed to designate.
</p>

<p>
	As you can see in the above example, truth is prior to proof. You can have a murder with zero proof, but you cannot have proof of a murder which never occurred.
</p>

<p>
	Proof is a secondary phenomenon. Truth is a primary phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, ultimately, when you get to nondual consciousness, proof will collapse into truth as everything becomes oneness. But you have to be careful here not to conflate absolute and relative domains. Proof only occurs in the relative domain. Truth occurs in all domains because it is everything that is. As an example, a donkey has not idea what proof is. You cannot prove anything to a donkey because proof is a conceptual human activity. But the donkey IS truth. Even though the donkey also has no concept of truth, it is BEING truth, whether it knows it or not is irrelevant in this case.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful with how you define your terms when doing philosophy, otherwise you end up playing word games. Here's how the dictionary defines "proof":
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			"evidence or argument establishing or helping to establish a fact or the truth of a statement."
		</p>

		<p>
			Synonyms:
		</p>

		<p>
			"evidence, verification, corroboration, authentication, confirmation, certification, validation, attestation, demonstration, substantiation, witness, testament"
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

		<p>
			Because you skimmed an article, you do not understand the complexity and nuances described in this article.  Your own mind is distorting you into labeling Mooji as "legit spiritual teacher".
		</p>

		<p>
			This is not what I said. He is abusing his position to have sex with his students, while being in a monogamous relationships.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you haven't skimmed the article, actually read it and CONTEMPLATED, you would see it is not relative and subjective. Your own devilry is coming to play here.
		</p>

		<p>
			How do you determine that something is "legit"? Your perception of what is "legit" and what is not could very easily be distorted here. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It's a relative matter to you, because you skimmed the article. If you bothered to read, and take it in the context, you would see the bigger picture. Having his students engage in criminal activity for him, and then take the falls for it, all just to earn his devotion is a VERY red flag.
		</p>

		<p>
			Somewhat? It is VERY problematic. The fact that you don't see the significance of what is going on here, given the context, is hilarious to me.
		</p>

		<p>
			All spiritual communities have this kind of abuse? Wtf are you talking about? 
		</p>

		<p>
			Do you factor in your own projections, judgments, and beliefs that you hold about Mooji? 
		</p>

		<p>
			If you want to understand what is going on here, you need to read the entire article. There is a lot more than "cult-like" features, there are a lot of red flags that you fail to see. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, all of that assumes the reporting is accuate and not exaggerated or taken out of context. That's a big assumption unless you have personal experience of being inside that community.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I skimmed the article is because I have no idea if what's being reported is accurate and I intuit a bias on behalf of the reporter. Ultimately I don't know.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I encourage anyone entering any kind of spiritual community to be very mindful of red flags and cult behavior, which is why I realease 2 videos about cults and put 4 books about cults in my book list. Armed with such information it will be very hard to get sucked into a cult.

</p>

<p>
	If you want to discuss things feel free to start specific threads, but just ranting against meditation or enlightenment without acknowledging the vast diversity of legit spiritual paths is just spreading your own ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Nuance! Naunce! Nuance!
</p>

<p>
	All of this is much more complicated than you currently understand.
</p>

<p>
	Be here to learn, not to rant.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Go back and read my comment again. I did not simply defend Mooji, I made a meta point about this whole topic.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever wrongs Mooji may have made the journalist does not understand the much deeper dynamics which underlie spiritual movements. This is a very nuanced and complex matter. Legit spiritual teachers are very easy to demonize.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I did not miss that.
</p>

<p>
	But you have to be mindful of your own projections here. Having sex freely does not necessarily mean anything bad. Monogamous sex is your own standard and expectation.

<p>
	Most of this relative and subjective.
</p>

<p>
	Forcing people from leaving is a serious problem if true.

Given the context, this plays a huge significance which you fail to see.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I said so myself. I do not like that approach to spirituality, but you must also understand that worship is a legit spiritual path for many people (bhakti yoga). It is not a path I would encourage but people have done it for thousands of years, and it can produce results. It's not merely ass-kissing.

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

<p>
	Again, a relative matter. What exactly does "smuggling" mean here?
</p>

<p>
	Running a community requires lots of money.
</p>

<p>
	Somewhat problematic but not too bad.

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">

<p>
	Again, you have to factor out your own projections, judgments, and the journalist's ignorance and bias about how spiritual communities work.
</p>

<p>
	-------
</p>

<p>
	None of this is a defense of Mooji. It seems his community has some cult-like features. But you need to look at it without judging it if you really want to underatand it. This is a meta point. I have no loyalty to Mooji.

<p>
	Watch your projections.
</p>

<p>
	I engage people in discussion more than any other Youtuber alive. I have answered tens of thousands of peoples critiques, questions, and comments. It is almost a full-time job because the ignorance and devilry from some of you guys has no end.
</p>

<p>
	If you understood what a cult really was you would realize Actuized.org is nowhere close to a cult and will never become one so long as I'm alive. What you guys do after I'm dead is another matter.

Balance is a dynamic thing which cannot be verbally explained or formulated, like surfing a wave. You can't tell someone how to surf a wave. He has to just get out on the wave and try to find his balance.

<p>
	This would be a big mistake.
</p>

<p>
	War is a real thing (as part of the dream). And sometimes it requires action from you, depending on the situation.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you're enlightened does not mean you become immune to survival threats.

<p>
	Sometimes, yes. Depends on the details of the situation.
</p>

<p>
	Some wars are aggressive and unnecessary. Some wars are defensive and prevent even greater damage in the future.
</p>

<p>
	For example, letting Hitler conquer Europe and execute all the Jews would have been a mistake (relative to human life).
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful not to conflate relative and absolute matters. This requires nuance. Simplistic solutions such as: no war ever, will actually result in greater evil. Violence must be done consciously. Which is very tricky to pull off.
</p>

<p>
	This is the problem of good and fair policing and justice. The process is easily corrupted by devils. But a world with 7 billion egos and zero police cannot work.

<p>
	Consciousness is often inconvenient in that goes directly against your short-term survival agenda. Which is precisely why so few people do it.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if your job requires you to lie all the time to get sales, focusing your consciousness on that will probably endanger your job.

<p>
	War is a very complex thing. Do not boil it down to simply ego.
</p>

<p>
	You must both:
</p>

<p>
	1) Understand the uselessness of war.
</p>

<p>
	2) Understand the necessity of war.
</p>

<p>
	When a tyrant has captured your country and enslaved half your people, you will understand the necessity of war.

<p>
	No, I read normally because I find it more enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
	Plus the kind of stuff I read these days is not be skimmed. It's to be deeply studied, underlined, contemplated, and re-read again.
</p>

<p>
	The top rated books on my book list are worth re-reading several times. And they must be studied, not just read. A few of my top rated books need to be re-read 5 times just to start to understand their full potential.
</p>

<p>
	Understand that reading is not a binary thing, like, Did you read that book? Yes/no? Reading has many degrees of comprehension to it. Do not make a mockery of reading by boiling it down to a quantitative measure like number of pages or books read. It's not enough to read, you must deeply study, contemplate, and do exercises.

	Do not joke about this. I've told you guys many times before not to turn this into a cult. It is important that you guys appreciate the dangers of that and play your part in avoiding it.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Worshiping is a dangerous path. I would like to see Mooji discouraging it.
</p>

<p>
	As for exorcisms, that's a standard spiritual practice. If you do lots of shamanic breathing / Holotropic breathing you will understand what exorcism means.
</p>

<p>
	There are two problems happening here simultaneously:
</p>

<p>
	1) Worshiping and cult dynamics truly are dangerous and can easily get out of hand.
</p>

<p>
	2) Spirituality is very deep and complex, and to an outsider or "normie", legit spiritual teachings, techniques, and behaviors can seen insane and even criminal when really they aren't. For example, it's true that Mooji is God. But so is everyone who's worshiping him.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like some of the stuff Mooji is doing is unhealthy. Yet at the same time it's probably healthier than what mainstream society is doing. So it's never black & white, as with Osho's ashram. A large ashram will have a lot of political games going on because it's like a small society. Running a small society is very thorny.
</p>

<p>
	You also have to take into account that some of the people who come to him for help are deeply troubled. They might already be suicidal, depressed, or in deep suffering. So you can't just blame all that on Mooji.
</p>

	Be nuanced. Not everything is survival.

	Sam Harris is a good real world example of what happens when a stage Orange person has some mystical/nondual experiences.
</p>

<p>
	It's not all that deep. Rather surface level spirituality. But still better than nothing. At least he advocates for meditation. But he does not understand the full depth of this work.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of wokeness.

You are taking this completely for granted.
</p>

<p>
	A human simply cannot be at all unless as God pretending to be a human. God has to play stupid so to speak because there is and never could be an actual material reality.
</p>

<p>
	Creation is imagination and illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Your deeper issue is that you are not doing serious self-inquiry so you are not conscious that you are God. This problem cannot be solved for you in any other way but to awaken. You will NEVER figure it out mentally as you are trying to do. All your reasoning will be wrong and irrelevant. So do the practices! This is not a matter of philosophy.

	A) You just haven't fully understood what you experienced. It takes a lot of experience (trips) to get your bearings straight. You can't make sense of consciousness/reality/God in one or two trips. That would be like trying to understand the ocean after two dives. Simply not enough experience.
</p>

<p>
	B) You are currently in a state of delusion.
</p>

<p>
	C) Nothing is bullshit proof. Truth requires consciousness and care.

<title>How do we know the universe is infinite and contains all?</title>

</p>

<p>
	As soon as your present state of consciousness changes, everything you hold to be true and correct will simply disappear as though it never existed.
</p>

<p>
	You are unwittingly trying to ground reality in something -- anything -- which prevents you from realizing that the Absolute nature of reality is groundlessness (AKA, infinity).
</p>

<p>
	What the LSD was showing you was truer than what you are presently conscious of. But it was too radical for your mind to integrate/understand. So as soon as your state of consciousness dropped (after the LSD wore off), you fell back asleep.
</p>

<p>
	Your mistake is assuming that your present state of consciousness is the highest/truest one. It is not. You are currently asleep and trying to figure out reality from a state of asleepness. This cannot work. It leads to delusion. It's as though you are using a cracked microscope to look at reality without realizing that you are the crack in the lens and therefore you are the source of the distortion.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to do a lot more LSD and seriously contemplate what reality. Your work has barely begun.
</p>

<p>
	Right now you are under a spell of self-deception. But you do not know it even when I tell you this. That's how strong your self-deception is. It's total!
</p>

<title>Will vs free will</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Free will vs no free will is yet another duality.
</p>

<p>
	The way the whole question is framed is fundamentally dualistic and silly because it assumes there is more than one entity.
</p>

<p>
	If there only exists one entity/object, does it have free will or not? See? It's an absurd question because anything it is, is identical with its will. There is no other outside it that could control it. The whole notion of control breaks down because control requires two objects: a controller and the controllee. This cannot hold if nonduality is the case.
</p>

<p>
	Being and Will turn out to be identical in a nondual state of consciousness.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	See, if you were deeply conscious, those habits would break your integrity and connection with the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you lie and steal while doing enlightenment work you will not get very far. Your lying and stealing will catch up with you. Karma 101.
</p>

<p>
	That guilt you feel is your soul telling you that you are not living up to your highest potential as God.

</p>

<p>
	Affirmations will of course not resolve the fundamental issue of duality or ego. But they can be a good intermediate technique. Not every technique has to be existential.
</p>

<p>
	This work requires nuance.

</p>

<p>
	The mind is a very powerful thing. When it's misused it can create all sorts of problems, even physiological ones.
</p>

<p>
	Start a daily meditation habit which will teach you to let go of your thoughts and tame your monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	Of course is you are doing something in your life which can cause cancer, like smoking or eating lots of processed meat, then you should also cut that out. But don't obsess over it.

It's not merely the ego in general. It's a very specific ego. The ego of you! Your particular self/psyche. The thing that makes you uniquely you.
</p>

<p>
	You are never going to describe your psyche fully using language. But as you study your own survival you can get an idea of what your psyche is up to, what is needs, what it wants, etc.
</p>

<p>
	So the goal is not to perfectly describe your self. Rather just become more and more familiar with it -- in the way you might get to know a child.

What you worry about tends to become true simply because you obsess about it so much.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to improve your life when you're constantly in fear.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to change your thoughts to love-based thoughts and shift your state to a more positive, optimistic, empowered one.
</p>

<p>
	Research Law Of Attraction.
</p>

<p>
	You want to create a positive, exciting vision for your future. Stop focusing on what you don't want and start focusing on what you want to create.
</p>

<p>
	Negative stuff can always happen, but constantly worrying about it is not a solution.

<p>
	Your question is thoroughly riddled with dualistic assumptions. Language is unavoidably dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	You are assuming Truth can be captured with language, but it can't because language is a small subset of Truth.

<p>
	Absolute Truth cannot be spoken, thought, or imagined.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot be qualified in any way whatsoever. You cannot even say of it: "It cannot be qualified".
</p>

<p>
	What you're unwittingly trying to do here is capture the Truth in some framework, which cannot ever work because Truth is infinity and it escapes all attempts at capturing it. This is just the nature of Truth/Infinity/Absolute. Hence the Zen-like riddles and paradoxes.

Pickup can take up a lot of mental energy, and so does business. Pickup also tends to screw your sleep schedule.

<p>
	Mother's love can be extremely conditional, as many kids can attest.
</p>

<p>
	It is a myth that mothers automatically accept their children. If only that were true.

			Then again though, what about you? You still have a business that, as far as I imagine, you seem to really care about the impact you have in yet you still pursue awakening and have found that balance to do both at the same time. How have you reconciled that in your own life? Not to get too personal here.

<p>
	As my blog post shows you, I have not reconciled it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't embody unconditional love.

<p>
	I can't really answer that.
</p>

<p>
	You just gonna have to walk your path and see where it leads. Part of the process is letting go of control or the need to plan it out or have a safety net.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta trust that you'll sort out the obstacles as you encounter them, not beforehand. That's life. Life's gotta be lived. It's a visceral experience. Get more comfortable with improving and letting things unfold organically. Experiment. Trial and error. Adventure.

<p>
	Don't disagree. Sit down and observe what suffering actually is and why you create it.

<p>
	Suffering arises out of resistance. Resistance is pure survival. If you did not care about survival you would not resist or suffer.
</p>

<p>
	Death isn't a real thing. You imagine it to maintain your false identity.

<p>
	What you have to understand is that those who reach such a radical degree of selflessness are not doing it out of a desire to have an impact. They are doing it because they seek the highest Truth, and everything else is just an organic consequence of that.
</p>

<p>
	To become that selfless would require that you drop all personal desires, including any desires to change the world. All attachments would have to be surrendered. The irony is, your ability to impact the world skyrockets when you come from a position of total detachment and selflessness. But the detachment has to be real. You have to surrender everything before you get it all back in the end.

	The come up is very smooth and gentle. That's the whole beauty of plugging. It's as easy as this process can get.

<p>
	All suffering was to ensure you lived a long life. Of course in the end all life comes to nothing. But there is a big difference between living 0 years and 80 years from your POV.

<p>
	It's a common defense mechanism, especially at first.
</p>

<p>
	Do inquiry after a good rest/nap, when you are max alert. Don't do inquiry at the end of the day when you are dead tired. Inquiry must be done at the peak of your day, not as an after-thought.

This notion must be discarded if you wish to understand spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Don't assume the Earth's population or even the Earth as an object fact.
</p>

<p>
	You are inside a dream. Never mistake the content within the dream as having a greater reality than the dreamer of the dream.

<p>
	Smoking is harsher than plugging.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging doesn't produce visuals, at least for me. Unless it's a really big dose, but even then the visual is: everything become infinite. It's not a psychedelic visual. It's more like pure consciousness being aware of its own infinitude. It's like a transparent sort of visual. Like the air got sucked out of the room and every object became infinite.
</p>

<p>
	At higher doses there's a freaky effect called recursion:
</p>

	<a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion" rel="external nofollow">https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Recursion</a>
</p>

<p>
	Don't close your eyes during the trip.

<p>
	Actually it's the most common scenario that even after an awakening or two the identity still stays.
</p>

<p>
	Very rarely is the identity totally transcended. Usually a spiritual identity is created. This happens even with many gurus, monks, and yogis.
</p>

<p>
	To transcend all identity completely is a very rare and challenging thing.

<p>
	That doesn't matter. It's still survival even if it's deluded or wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Someone pursuing enlightenment to escape suffering, for example, is doing it out of survival. Now maybe he happens to finally reach nirvana, where survival is extinguished, but that's distinct from how/why he got there. His motivations were still survival-driven in this case.

<p>
	Yes, it would certainly work, and work powerfully.
</p>

<p>
	But be careful what you wish for. Depending on how many inner demons you got, it could get hairy. But then again, that's where the real growth is.
</p>

<p>
	There tends to be an inverse relationships between growth and comfort. You can't have both at once.
