<p>
	That cannot happen because India is nowhere near ready to handle Green. The US isn't barely able to handle it.
</p>

<p>
	India will have to go through 50-100 years of Orange first.

<p>
	Yes, but that cannot be helped. I am not going to not talk about Love simply because of fear someone will misunderstand me.

<p>
	This is true for all the spiritual teachers you follow.
</p>

<p>
	The average student has no idea the work that their favorite guru has done behind the scenes. The guru is just sitting there talking and making it sound easy.
</p>

<p>
	When I tell people that enlightenment requires 1000+ hours of work, I get criticized for being too limiting and negative. I have never made this work sound easy like many teachers do. I call it work because it requires work. Those who don't do the work will not understand what I teach and that is not my problem because 90%+ of people who listen to me will not do any of the work. And I can't be bothered by that.

<p>
	This is inevitable and I speak out against it all the time with dozens of warnings.
</p>

<p>
	I have given plenty of warnings. If you can't understand them then this work is not for you.
</p>

<p>
	I am not going to dumb my work down just because your mind gets easily lost in concepts.

<p>
	The next step for India is Blue/Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Basically Modi is the right fit for India -- despite his nationalism. Most Hindus are deeply stuck in nationalistic stage Blue attitudes and will remain so for at least another few generations.

<p>
	It goes beyond any one example. Just the fact that reality is imaginary is my deepest love for reality. If reality was anything other than imaginary, I would be deeply disappointed at the stupidity of reality.
</p>

<p>
	The first time I realized reality was imaginary was the happiest day of my life. I said, "Thank God! Of course! Finally it makes sense."
</p>

<p>
	If reality was not imaginary it would be an insult to intelligence because then reality would be limited. But of course reality cannot be limited because there exists nothing outside of reality to limit it, and this is the greatest thing about reality.

<p>

<p>
	If you are not conscious that you are God, then do not claim you are God. Claim that you do not know what you are.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe you are human, then state so.
</p>

<p>
	When I tell you that you are God, I am telling you what you can become conscious of if you work at it. In the same way that if I tell you about Alaska that is so that you could one day visit Alaska for yourself. Believing that you are in Alaska while you are not is idiocy.

	India is definitely not ready for socialism. Socialism in India, if implemented, would be a repeat of Soviet Union.

	You are. And that is imagination.

<p>
	Just realize that all physical objects are a dense form of imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Your hand is like a unicorn, but more dense, hence you can see it with the eyes rather than just with your mind.

			The "bad" part of the trip: oh my god it was like nothing I ever experienced. It's like the line between imagination and reality was erased, and my imagination was reality. Reality would seamlessly shift and transformÂ like my imagination would seamlessly shift and transform.Â For instance: my girlfriend was driving us home and I thought of watching one of Leo's youtube videos and that became my reality. My reality was the awareness of Leos video, and that reality was me.Â Leo would tell me to wake up and suddenly my reality would shift to pure colors and transform into taking with one of my friends. As I was trying to talk to my friend and tell them I need help because I don't know what's real or who I am, I suddenly KNEW that my friend was me and that there was no need to explain anything to him. That reality would then fractalize and I would travel through infinity and experience infinite cycles of knowing and forgetting the truth.Â I would then come back to this reality, but this reality was no longer real.Â I felt complete oneness with my experience and completelyÂ alone at the same time:Â like everything and everyone was merely something I was imagining and that I was the only real thing. Knowing that filled me with complete existential despair.Â I just wanted to die, but I knew that ceasing to be was impossible, that even if I died in the "real" reality, that "real" reality wasn't even real and wasn't me. That if I tried to kill myself in "real" life, it would merely be meÂ imaginingÂ shooting myself in the head and continue shifting and transforming realities.Â TheseÂ shifts and transformations in reality occurredÂ for a good 6 hours and I felt completely alone, horrible, and eternally doomed.

			Now: I am completely full of existential terror, dread, confusion, and despair. I feel like nothing, including myself, is real and that there is no point of existence. That there is no meaning to a completely imaginary singular reality in this sea of infinite imagined realities. And worst of all: I feel like I am eternal and that I can never end. And oh my god I just want this all to end. I can't handle what I experienced, I can't handle KNOWING that all of this reality is imagined and everyone else is just my imagination. I can't handle knowing that I am the only thing, that I am god,Â and that I am infinite. I just want it all to end, for me to disappear, but I know that's not possible because on the trip I've already disappeared in this reality.

<p>
	Of course it's all true, the only problem is that you jumped in too deep too fast and your ego isn't properly integrating it.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing bad about reality being imaginary. This is the best possible news. You just have to learn to appreciate it and accept it.

I've been feeling this way for 4 days now trying my best to just feel the feelings,Â but this dark night of the soul feels like it has no resolution. Its like I've peeled back the veil of reality and seen the truth, and the truth is infinite, alone, and despairing. I can now remember the trip whenever I want, but because I can remember how I felt and what I knew during that tripÂ any notion of who I am and what is real has no ground. Everything feels fake and imaginary and I feel trapped in this hopeless meaningless ride of existence & nothingness. Everyone and everything in my life is just something I am imagining and I'm completely alone. I am in complete hell. TheÂ truth is complete hell. I want to end.

<p>
	You're not in hell, you're in heaven. Stop giving these experience negative meanings.
</p>

<p>
	Since you are God and you are imagining reality, whatever you imagine will become real for you. If you imagine things are bad, that's how life will feel. If you start seeing the goodness in everything and everyone, then life will become amazing.
</p>

<p>
	Your ego is just over-reacting. Stop buying it's negative stories.

I can't handle being alone. And nothing I do is pulling me out of these depths.

<p>
	Just take it easy, distract yourself with something fun, go enjoy nature or a TV show. After a few weeks these trips will leave your mind and you will calm down.
</p>

<p>
	All that happened here is you had a bad trip. Forget about it, walk it off, and in a month you will hardly remember it even happened.
</p>

<p>
	This is what happens when you disrespect the power of psychedelics. Your dose was 5x too high. That's all.

<p>
	The only veil is the one materialists imagine.
</p>

<p>
	All of materialism is imaginary -- and so are all of its metaphysical and epistemic problems and limits. Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	IF materialism was true, THEN the veil would be a serious problem. But materialism isn't true, hence there is no problem.

<p>
	It is problematic to give students all the answers, but the reason I do it is because it is just as problematic not to. When things are left vague and ambiguous it's not like the mind will be blank. The mind will fill in the blank with wrong ideas.
</p>

<p>
	This is why I dislike the Zen style and I do not teach in that style. My mission is to create a robust catalogue of answers. If you don't like thatÂ then don't watch.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I find Zen highly misleading by trying to be mysterious. In the end I don't see any Zen students understand what I have understood.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, you're damned if you do, and you're damned if you don't.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like playing Zen games. I tell the answer exactly as I see it. It is your job to not get lost in concepts. My work isÂ highly conceptual. I have no interest in doing teachings like Rupert Spira or Mooji.

	You can push your software and hardware to its limits, but eventually you will still hit a biological limit since you are committed to being in that human form.
</p>

<p>
	You can't do what LSD can do simply through visualiation. Visualization is nice, but it is still limited by your hardware.

<p>
	Not only that, but much of the limits are software which can be upgraded.
</p>

<p>
	It's difficult to know when a limit is hardware vs software since there is no clear line between them.

			Ime, this is one of the values of psychedelics. I thought I had an idea of what my hardware potential was and that I was reaching 90% or so of it. Then psychedelics revealed so much expansion that I realized I was only operating at about 0.1% of my hardware potential. It was like realizing I had beenÂ playing Atari games on a PS5.Â

<p>
	I consider psychedelics hardware because you cannot easily change your natural neurotransmitter cocktail.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics show you the absolute importance of hardware in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you could permanently alter your natural nuerotransmitter cocktail you could acheive levels of conscious impossible otherwise.

			I find the talk about spiritual talent quite unsettling, since my emotional reaction is hearing someone telling me that I have no talent. And I'm defensive of the notion of talent as it's talked about hereÂ because I don't want to believe it and internalise it. So I won't believe it.Â <br />
			<br />
			This talk about talent, and a few other things like statesÂ and etc.Â You can call it me projecting my insecurities (which I can accept) or just not being the right thing for me to hear right now, but it doesn't foster the correct mindset in me.Â Hearing it talked about this way invokes in me the mindset of playing a relative game which is all about material acquisition of spiritual goodies.Â <br />
			Maybe what you guys is saying is 'true' , I don't know, but it doesn't help me to read it since I think it creates an incorrect mindsetÂ (YesÂ yes, no one is forcing me to believe it and this is just my reaction).Â

<p>
	It's way deeper than merely talent.
</p>

<p>
	It's more like I'm telling you that you cannot fly because you weren't born a bird. The bird isn't simply talented at flying. The bird has hardware that you don't have.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise there are many things you are not conscious of because you don't have the hardware.

<p>
	Degrees of consciousness are not an intellectualization.
</p>

<p>
	Models of consciousness are of course conceptual constructions. But that does not mean consciousness doesn't have degrees in the same way light has degrees of brightness.
</p>

<p>
	Dim light and bright light are NOT concepts. Good look at the sun.

<p>
	If you can't handle it, then stop pursuing awakening.
</p>

<p>
	What you can handle increases as you increase your practice. That's the whole point of practice.

<p>
	No, degrees of consciousness are actually prior to and more fundamental than insight.

<p>
	You are presently in some state of consciousness. This state has a certain qualitative degree of consciousness.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Depends on your goals.
</p>

<p>
	It's an important habit regardless because there's no way you will be able to handle even a 10 day retreat without years of daily practice.
</p>

<p>
	1 hr per day is important but not nearly enough for serious awakening.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't do 30 days, then even 10 days is good. I had my first awakening on day 8 of a 10 day retreat. And I wasn't even meditating close to 24/7. Even 8 days of 5 hrs of strict meditation per day is enough for a breakthrough. Building up momentum is the key to breaking through. Your mind must be 100% focused on the task of awakening and not any other survival distractions.

	You will never awaken deeply through 1-hour daily practice. It's never going to be enough.
</p>

<p>
	You must stake your entire life on it if you want it. This is how all the masters did it and why none of their students succeed. It takes seriousness, and you are not serious.

	The girl's attraction is NOT logical. Neither is a guy's.
</p>

<p>
	You see big tits and you get attracted. It has nothing to do with logic. If you saw big tits on a grizzly bear, you'd still get attracted and by the time the grizzly bear was eating your face, it'd be too late.

You must wake up every morning and work on it consistently for years.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't motivate and discipline yourself then you shouldn't be starting a biz, you should be looking for a boss who will give you work to do and a timeline to do it by.
</p>

<p>
	Success in biz requires extreme ambition and self-motivation. The average person does not have enough ambition or self-motivation to succeed in business. Which is why they work for boss.

<p>
	Fixing your inner game is crucial for success with women. You cannot attract women with your kind of toxic negative mindset.
</p>

<p>
	You must reprogram your mind with positive talk, positive vision, success, and positive beliefs. Removing all negative beliefs and self-doubt. This is huge part of learning game.
</p>

<p>
	You will only ever keep the quality of girl you believe you deserve.
</p>

<p>
	It makes no difference that you are an incel, all that matters is your vision for who you will become in the future.
</p>

<p>
	You should already see yourself as a player, not an incel.
</p>

<p>
	The girl has no clue you were an incel in the past, nor does she care.
</p>

<p>
	Incels and losers never cold approach hot girls. Only players do that. Only winners do that.
</p>

<p>
	You need to spend the next 6 months, every day, drilling into your mind positive visions for yourself as a successful player. And any time a negative thought enters your mind, you notice it, you catch it, you stop it, and you replace it with a positive one of yourself being even more successful than you first imagined. You have to reframe every failure and every rejection as success.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Be authentic, be strong, be masculine, be feminine, and be a bit vulnerable in order to build intimacy and rapport.
</p>

<p>
	After you reach hook-point with attraction, then you want to start building intimacy and connection, which is best done by sharing personal stories that reveal your softer side.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, the girl wants you to be a killer on the outside, with others, but soft and sweet with her. Of course this is an absurd contradiction, but nevertheless that's what makes her wet. Find that balance.

<p>
	Of course psychedelics will not necessarily cure you of homicidal tendencies. To expect that is absurd.

<p>

<p>
	Consciousness has the QUALITY of being more or less conscious of itself. You cannot ever put a number on this quality. But the qualitative differences are there.

<p>
	Many people who listen to JP's psychological lectures and talks never see the sum total of his regressive stage Blue political positions, and so they are slowly indoctrinated into it over time without even realizing it.
</p>

<p>
	This is why JP fans often say, "What wrong with JP? He helped me!"
</p>

<p>
	Yes, he helped you, but he also indoctrinated you with stage Blue ideology and demonized stage Green. And you don't even realize it because he sounds academic and intelligent.

<p>
	You're not literally gonna be 0% invested through all that. Just keep your investment low. The best way to do that is by talking to more girls until she wants to go exclusive with you.

Forget about her and move on to hundreds of other, better girls.
</p>

<p>
	You are not doing pickup properly by over-investing in this one girl. There is nothing special about her. It's just an illusion. Shake it off and move on.
</p>

<p>
	You will never be able to maintain a girl that you're this needy for. She will find you more repulsive than a serial rapist.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of women will fall in love with you if you stop this neediness and go build yourself into a strong man.
</p>

<p>
	You must go pursue 100s of other women. Do not play this victim game.

<p>
	Haha
</p>

<p>
	That's some Ralstonian bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	There are infinite degrees of consciousness and nobody in Ralston-land, including Brendan, has become remotely conscious of them.
</p>

<p>
	And awareness/experience IS consciousness, as if it were not that would result in a substance duality.
</p>

<p>
	"Levels" is not the best term for it. "Degrees" is better.

<p>
	I think what's really missed by most thinkers is the depth of the economic restructuring that's necessary for a truly stage Green society.
</p>

<p>
	They just pretend like neoliberalism is fine. They ignore the deep systemic problems of capitalism which are not being addressed. It's like they think we can have a stage Orange economic system while we skip over Green and move on to Yellow culturally. We'll that's not gonna fly.
</p>

<p>
	We need a much more democratic economic system. But this entire point is being obscured by the culture wars. Forget about the culture wars. The real question is: How do we move the economy from Orange to Green? How do we transition the majority of business practices on this planet from Orange to Green? This is what Wilber and the rest are not seriously thinking about. Orange economics and business is not sustainable.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I've seen it before. This happens because Beck doesn't understand the mysticism which grounds Ken's work.
</p>

<p>
	Ken understands the limits of Spiral Dynamics and sought ways to expand upon it. But of course Beck takes this personally because he's devoted his entire life to just Spiral Dynamics. Which is precisely the problem with narrow-minded academia and science. It's too myopic and lost in its models.
</p>

<p>
	Beck did some great work, but it is limited and now it's time to go way beyond it. This is the nature of all scientific work. It's only good until you outgrow it. Then it becomes your prison cell.
</p>

<title>Being &quot;Too Nice&quot; in Dating</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/17880-jordan-a/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="17880" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/17880-jordan-a/" rel="">@Jordan A</a> You can be a strong leader and don't put women on a pedestal without actually treating them bad or disrespecting them.
</p>

<p>
	You need to grow some balls and act more cocky around women. But you will not be abusing them. Make that distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the attitude you want to adopt when flirting with women is that you are the king/boss. But you are a benevolent king.
</p>

<p>
	Challenge the woman without insulting her. And never bend over backwards for her.
</p>

<p>
	Caring for women is not a problem, but you must save that until after she gets attracted to you.
</p>

<p>
	You can calibrate this by being 10-20% more of an asshole. Of course you don't want to be 100% of an asshole -- which would actually hurt your results. But 10-20% more should be roughly the sweet-spot.
</p>

<p>
	An easy way to implement this is to simply be more authentic about your negative assessments and emotions about her. For example, be brutally honest when you don't like something about her. You could tell her, "I don't like your dress." There probably already are plenty of things you don't like about her, but you don't say them because you are being too nice. Stop doing that. Be more authentic with your negative feelings. Stop trying to only be positive with her. Then you will shed your nice guy image.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to get good at this, you can ask yourself this question while you are flirting with her, "What doesn't please me about her?"
</p>

<p>
	Then you might tell her something like, "Your glasses are goofy."
</p>

<p>
	Then she will try to please you to re-gain your validation.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful not to take this too far because it is possible to insult her and blow yourself out. For example, NEVER say negative things about her weight. Unless she is skinny like a toothpick, this will instantly blow you out. You need to find ways of expressing disapproval without being overly mean or insulting.
</p>

<p>
	None of these theorists are deeply conscious people, which is why you have to be very careful with not holding their models too tightly.
</p>

<p>
	A model is just a model. And SD can easily get you into trouble.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber is by far the most conscious theorist alive. But even he has his limits. There is a serious lack of people who understand consciousness, spirituality, politics, culture, and economics all at once. This basically does not exist. If you want such understanding you will have to be one of the first humans to ever develop it.

<p>
	There are thousands of different kinds of mystical states and experiences. You will not be able to predict or easily categorize them.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to imagine them or worry about them is a mistake and a distraction. Focus on becoming conscious of what's true in your experience.
</p>

<p>
	Do not use the experiences of others as a reference for yourself. You are not them.

<p>
	Don't think of introspection as merely analysis. Introspection is literally: looking inward. Which is just consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There is no other way.
</p>

<p>
	You just need to upgrade your notion introspection to a more holistic one.

<p>
	Omg, Don Beck is cringe.
</p>

<p>
	Just goes to show that SD can be misused in the hands of a Boomer.
</p>

<p>
	I like that Trump is the perfect litmus test to seperate the truly conscious from the unconscious. Similar to how Hitler was a litmus test to seperate the truly good intelletuals, like Einstein, from the hacksÂ and confromists.
</p>

<p>
	It's not enough to know SD, the key is to consciously apply it with proper interpretations of the situation and awareness of one's self-biases.
</p>

<p>
	Even people like Ken Wilber misapply SD and misunderstand stage Green. When it comes to Green economics, virtually no Boomer gets it. It's like they are blinded by a lifetime of neoliberal propaganda from which they have benefited.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that Trump is good for America is laughable. The only thing he's good for is exposing how dumb half the country is and how fragile our institutions are.
</p>

<p>
	Republicans and GOP have no answers. They are totally corrupt, ignorant, and morally bankrupt. They have no interest in good government.
</p>

<p>
	As Noam Chomsky correctly says, the Republican party is the most dangerous group of people in the world. Furture generations will laugh in disbelief at how dumb the entire AmericanÂ right-wing was. And even people like DonÂ Beck and Ken Wilber will be seen to be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
	Mackey knows SD apparently, but he's still so baised about capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	Economically he's neoliberal.
</p>

<p>
	Again, his job depends on him not understanding the problems with capitalism.

	This would have the opposite effect. Iranian nationalism would flourish and the existing stage Blue gov would gain massive support if any outsider attacked Iran.

<title>How come people don't Realise God even on 5-MeO-DMT?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/57855-how-come-people-dont-realise-god-even-on-5-meo-dmt/?do=findComment&amp;comment=778933</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	A) Because psychedelics do not have the same effect on people due to different metabolisms and genetics.
</p>

<p>
	B) Because most psychedelic users do not have a desire or intention to get to Absolute Truth or to deconstruct reality.
</p>

<p>
	Having insight requires a deep commitment to it. You can't just take a psychedelic, wander off to Ikea with your wife, and expect to understand God.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well ask: How come some kids in school really understand math while most of them don't? Because the ones who really understand it devoted thousands of hours to doing math while the other kids wereÂ off screwing around on the playground.
</p>

<p>
	It's never enough to just do a thing. You must do it well.
</p>

<p>
	Realizing God requires deconstructing all of reality. And nobody wants to do that.
</p>

<p>
	This is a load of BS.

<p>
	People are not capable of "just enjoying" conspiracy theories. They will start taking them seriously and before they know it their entire worldview will be corrupted by them.

<title>I think Diary causes me acne</title>

<p>
	Through a long process of elimination and trial and error I discovered that the sole cause of my acne was eating pre-made food from restaurants and other places that use cheap oils for cooking. After I started preparing all my own food, the acne went away entirely, and it comes back as soon as eat something prepared by a commercial kitchen. My guess is because they use very low quality oils or additives.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like heavily processed protein powders also cause massive acne.
</p>

<p>
	I can eat dairy without acne now.
</p>

<p>
	Try doing a diet where you only eat food you've prepared yourself, and notice the massive difference it makes.
</p>

<p>
	Interesting. I never tried it orally so can't compare. I just know it's way potent. And for me it lasts 4hrs+
</p>

<p>
	For all plugged substances onset is about 10 minutes for me.

<p>
	No because they do not have a stable government so it would likely fall into rogue terrorist hands. And besides, there is no way they could develop such weapons in their current state of disorder.
</p>

<p>
	But if a country is politically stable and isn't a stage Red terrorist state, then generally they have a right to nuclear weapons as long as they are smart enough to build them.
</p>

<p>
	Iran is not Syria.

<p>
	Sounds like her logic was very simple: She found a guy who she was more excited about. Now you do the same and find a girl you're more excited about.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that she was not happy with you and you probably couldn't have fixed it. So the divorce was gonna happen regardless.

	Dude, an attack on North Korean would be an epic clusterfuck worse than the Iraq War. Nothing good would come of it. North Korea would immediately bomb Seoul and kill millions of civilians. This is not Iraq in the middle of nowhere.

<p>
	You are not going to make a bad country a good country by bombing it and taking out its leadership.
</p>

<p>
	Look at what happened in Iraq and in Lybia.

	Guns are not nukes. Your analogy sucks.
</p>

<p>
	And there's really not muchÂ you can do to stop a sovereign nation from developing nukes other than devilry and war.
</p>

<p>
	North Korea having nukes has been one of the only things that stopped the US from attacking it. If Iraq had nukes there would have been no Iraq War.

			Leo, let me ask you this, Do you think there was a one in a million chance that things go smoothly even if Saddam stayed in power? Like the more I listened to you, and read books, the more I know about those infinite onion layers about the world around me and myself.
		</p>

		<p>
			Here's what I have in mind, Things in Iraq has started to change since the discovery of crude oil, the west gave Iraq oil technology, unlimited source of money which we do not deserve. This has spoiled the shit out of the Iraqi nation for decades, then the west gave us medical knowledge, and vaccines, agricultural technologies, which made our numbers explodes, But then lets go back to 7000 years ago, who invented writing? it is the people lived on Iraq land, Mesopotamian, who invented and wrote the first laws, it is Sumarians. When you see western intervention in Iraq today, This is the same as a snake has grown big and now biting its own tail.
		</p>

		<p>
			Iraq since dawn of history is one of the cradles of civilization, without what happens there, there would be no America, no Internet, even no war and expansion (Assyrians lived in Iraq are credited for this concept). I wish one day you stop seeing this duality, I mean even the concept of a country, it has been bestowed on Iraq by British, in fact as history tells us, a British lady takes the credit to put in power the first Iraqi king, so in theory, Iraq is a creation of the west, and it is not rational to expect that it can hold itself together, not under Saddam, not even for the following 50 years to com.

<p>
	A) Why the hell would you carry 5-MeO-DMT in your back pocket and sit on it???

<p>

	Well, Israel's POV is just that, their selfish POV.
</p>

<p>
	Iran is not going to launch nukes at Israel for the same reason no nation launches nukes at anyone else: because it would be suicidal. And Iran is not suicidal.
</p>

<p>
	Iran is not stage Red, it's stage Blue. Iran has sensible leadership. They are not some nutcase terrorist rogue state. They have a giant civilization to defend.

<p>
	It's the US who broke the deal. Iran is fully in its right to have nuclear weapons. And it's good for them to acquire them, so that they stop being bullied by the US and Israel.
</p>

<p>
	The irony of nuclear weapons is that they actually prevent acts of violence like the one above, and any nation that does not have nukes get bullied.

<p>
	Lack of love leads to a desire to deny others love.
</p>

<p>
	Feeling love leads to a desire to share love with others.
</p>

<p>
	It's so simple.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing consciousness wants is to feel Love, because it is Love. The entire motion of the universe is nothing but consciousness seeking to find the Love it lost -- to be completely in Love with itself.
</p>

<p>
	All motion is a reaching towards Love.
</p>

<p>
	God is an infinite, eternal being which is constantly dreaming itself into existence using infinite mind. Which is exactly what you are doing. You just aren't conscious that you're doing so because you believe you are a human in a physical universe.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at the world without the background belief that you are a human inside a physical world.
</p>

<p>
	For example, try looking at your body without assuming that it is a physical human body. Try to imagine that the skin on your body is made out of cosmic-stuff or mind-stuff, not physical matter.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that your hands are God's hands, made out of pure eternal consciousness. You are the conscious universe looking at itself.
</p>

<title>What is consciousness made of?</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	There is only one way to understand what consciousness is made of. You are consciousness. Look at yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It's that simple. And no other method will work. Looking at yourself is not optional so stop trying to get around it.
</p>

<p>
	It's like, you are willing to do anything to understand consciousness, except the only thing which leads to understanding of consciousness -- which is looking at consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	So you will never understand consciousness until you look at it. Look real close. Look real steady. Look real deep.
</p>

<p>
	Microscoops are very accurate as long as you're using the same batch of substance.
</p>

<p>
	If you change batches, then you'll have to recalibrate, which isn't a problem.
</p>

<p>
	My standard rule of thumb is to take 1 microscoop of any substance. Rarely will 1 microscoop get you into trouble. The ideal dose for many substances is between 1 to 3 microscoops. This is for plugging/snorting. Vaping needs to be lower, like half a microscoop to start.

	You will never get a donkey to understand calculus. Because he doesn't have the necessary hardware.

	The problem here is that talented people take their talents for granted because they have no idea what it's like not to have their talents.
</p>

<p>
	Someone born enlightened will not understand why everyone else is not enlightened and acting so stupid. This is not just a hypothetical. I've actually met people like this. It takes them a long time to learn that they are unique and different from everyone else. It is a big practical problem for them. They are like an alien among their own kind.

	No, that's not required. ManyÂ super talented people are highly intuitive and passionate and know what they should be doing. Their heart naturally draws them to whatever they are talented in.

<p>
	Probably not, but who knows.
</p>

<p>
	ALA and DMSA are notÂ toxic by themselves. But they can be toxic if you got a lot of heavy metals in you that they will move around.

	Doing detox requires careful attention on how you feel before, during, and after.

	You can climb Mt Everest on your belly, or you can take a rocketship.
</p>

<p>
	Of course those who do it on their belly will have bad things to say about those who take the rocketship.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, ain't nobody got time for belly-climbing.

<p>
	He certainly worked his ass off. But if you think that Ralston is not in the top 0.0001% of spiritually gifted people on the planet, you are fooling yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You ain't Ralston and you will never be.
</p>

<p>
	Commitment is not enough. No matter how much a donkey tries, it will never become God-realized.
</p>

<p>
	I know people who were born enlightened and who have spiritual powers that you will never have even after a lifetime of practice. When it comes to spirituality, genetics is far more important than practice. This is what gurus never tell you, because it isn't so nice to hear.

<p>
	I just find it silly when progressives call the President a war criminal or the CIA terrorists. It's a very naive and reductive take.
</p>

<p>
	The situation is far more complex. Governance is a brutal business.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, of course governance could be done more humanely and compassionately. But also don't forget that the leaders we elect can only be as compassionate as us who elect them. Saints are not getting elected to office any time soon.

	And many commodity items I would have to buy in a giant store regardless. What difference does it make if I buy my razor blades from Amazon vs Walmart vs supermarket?

	I don't know what that means. Obviously he thinks since he talks and writes. He thinks 5-MeO-DMT doesn't produce awakening. Which is not only thinking, it's bad thinking.

<p>
	Good. But so what? We're not necessarily talking about him. We're talking about awakening the rest of mankind. And since the majority of his students are not awake it would be a shame to deny them the benefits of something like 5-MeO-DMT by dismissing it.

<p>
	It might be evil, but it's not really terrorism. It's how intelligence agencies work.
</p>

<p>
	Intelligence agencies do selfish stuff. Yeah. That's kind of their job.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like complaining that the President is a war criminal. He's a military commander. He makes military decisions which involve life and death. That is the job.

If so, how do you justify using it despite the workers rights reputation it has?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course I use it.
</p>

<p>
	I justify it in that lots of companies have abusive labor practices. I can't keep track of everyone's abuses. We need better regulations at the government level. Amazon does pay $15/hr these days.
</p>

<p>
	In general I don't believe boycotts are an effective means of improving society. It's too little too late. For Amazon to be changed by this you'd need millions of customers boycotting in a highly coordinated matter -- which I don't see happening. If it was about to happen, then I might join in.
</p>

<p>
	I'm generally not a fan of fighting for lost causes. If I fight for something I want it to have a decent chance at success. You have to fight with the grain of evolution, not against it. For example, fighting against smart phones is not gonna work. Smart phones are a force of nature that you will not be able to stop.

Amazon is here to stay. People will buy more and more commodities online because the reality is that local mom and pop stores are not efficient enough to survive into the future for staple goods.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually majority of stuff should be purchasable online from a single place. Because that's most efficient.
</p>

<p>
	As societies evolve old business models will die out.

<p>
	It's a silly notion born of a naive understanding of how government and intelligence works.
</p>

<p>
	Every major government around the world is involved in covert intelligence operations upon which the survival of the country depends. Since the stakes are so high, some murder and sabotage and so forth will of course take place. This just the cost of having a large government.
</p>

<p>
	The CIA is not playing patty-cakes. Their job is to deal with life and death situations every day. If they think that socialism is not in the survival interest of America, they will certainly not hesitate to sabotage it. The CIA is not playing by any rules of fairness or truth or love. They are playing the game of survival -- and basically anything goes. That's how intelligence works.
</p>

<p>
	The CIA isn't powerful enough to overturn a major internal democratic vote. If people really wanted socialism, the CIA couldn't stop it. But they can manipulate (to some degree) public opinion before it reaches that point.
</p>

<p>
	The CIA isn't really the problem. The problem is getting ordinary people to question capitalism. You don't need the CIA doing anything about socialism when all of right-wing media is demonizing it every day already and 40% of the citizenry believe that socialism is evil.
</p>

	Heavy metals will cause cancer and all sorts of other vague health problems down the road.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, you won't even know some health condition 10 years from now was caused by the heavy metals. Your doctors will never link the two things. They will blame it on bad genetics or bad luck.

<p>
	Firstly, many do.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, many aren't conscious of what Love is. It is not easy to become conscious of what Love is via traditional meditation. Meditation tends to lead to the Void, which gives people a false sense of completion. Traditional meditation only explores a narrow spectrum of consciousness.

	When you meditate on the breath, don't inhale any deeper than when you're not meditating.

<p>
	It is a mistake to exaggerate your inhales when meditating. Just keep it normal.

</p>

<p>
	Go do some actual work towards awakening, not this tail-chasing.

	It's simple: you project your own ignorance onto them. But of course your ego cannot handle such a possibility, so you just double down on your projections.

<p>
	Yes! Good quoting.
</p>

<p>
	Fighting with the ego is just more ego. Analogous to how judging yourself for being judgmental is just a doubling of the mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I said that Self-Love is the highest teaching. Hating the ego doesn't work. Loving the ego works better. If the ego is acting out it's only because it seeks Love which it has been denied. So give it some Love to pacify it.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to get the ego onboard with killing itself is by showing the ego that "killing itself" just means Infinite Love.
