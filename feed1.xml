<title>Why is reality arational and not rational?</title>

<p>
	Firstly, no human being is rational. There is nothing rational about survival.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, the concept of rationality depends on a duality created by the rationalist which carves up the world into rational vs its opposite. So by the very logic of the rationalist, to say something is rational is to say something else is not, which be definition means the world contains both rational and not rational things. Which means the world is not rational. If everything in the universe was rational the label "rational" would cease to have any meaning. The only value this label has in precisely because there are irrational things afoot which you wish to distinguish from rational things.
</p>

<p>
	Rationality is a self-defeating category. As all categories are. Because they are projections of the human mind. Reality does what it does regardless of whether it fits your rationalist criteria. Absurd things happen every day.
</p>

You're the one coming up with theories here. And all theories miss the mark.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is not a theory.
</p>

<p>
	What matter is if you are lost in the mind or awake.
</p>

<p>
	At this point you are still deeply stuck in your own mind. This results in living a deluded life, full of discontent and suffering. When you get tired of your mind games, come on back and we can show you how to awaken.

	Locked for being a trolling topic.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see anyone but a psychopath killing animals for pure pleasure. Even avid hunters don't kill animals for pure pleasure. And certainly no one on this forum kills animals for pure pleasure.

It does not work how you think it works.
</p>

<p>
	Question all your assumptions to discover how it really works (or if it even exists).

<p>
	Sorry to hear that. Our society is not really designed to treat these kinds of edge cases.
</p>

<p>
	The advice is: take full ownership of your life. Do not expect anyone else to solve your emotional or psychological issues for you. Get a journal and start working it out yourself. Start doing research, start reading books, start watching videos. Become the expert on your condition and cure yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you got more fundamental issues to resolve before you worry about meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Find a way to ease off the drugs if it is safe to do so.
</p>

<p>
	You can solve this. It will just take some work.
</p>

<p>
	The universe is perfect only once the "you" is gone. So long as there's a "you", it will bitch and moan about things not going its way.
</p>

<p>
	Extinction of humans would be a great thing for many other creatures.
</p>

<p>
	If humans go extinct it will be because that is what is best to raise the overall consciousness of the universe. So it's all good in the end.

</p>

<p>
	Just because the ears cannot hear the color red, you don't hold that against them, so why are you holding it against thoughts that they cannot see red? Each sense has its own unique qualities which the others do not. And so what?
</p>

<p>
	Try a psychedelic and you will realize that it is possible to think infinite thoughts which break all conventional linear logical molds.

<p>
	I don't know why you are so attached to this idea that the mind cannot contain/create new information. This is just silly.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it is true that the mind commonly rehashes a lot for information that was fed into it, but this is not some physical law. The mind also produces original insights, images, and ideas.
</p>

<p>
	All of these notions that you appeal to so loosely such "mind", "thoughts", "information" are very tricky and nuanced things. You don't actually yet know what these things are or how they work.

</p>

<p>
	The distinction between internal/external that you are making is itself a self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	There certainly is no such thing as a "real world". That is a fantasy occuring in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	You see how sneaky the mind is? Your attempt to refute self-deception has itself become a self-deception. Thus proving my point.

</p>

<p>
	The universe is so intelligent that it figured out a way to design itself down the very last molecule.
</p>

<p>
	You can see a bit of this in action if you observe how your own mind works. The mind does not randomly string together permuations of words and ideas. The mind intelligently selects each thought so it makes maximum sense. This is the universe in action. The universe is thinking your thoughts for you. How? That is the wonder of it! It's astounding.

<p>
	If I was blaming people for blaming people, yes. That of course would be delusional.

<p>
	But just to call delusion for what it is is not delusional. Delusion is an inevitable part of life.

<p>
	This cannot be understood in your present state of consciousnsess -- like, at all. It doesn't make sense to the linear logical mind. There is little sense trying to think this through. You must do intense practices or psychedelics to get it.

<p>
	That's begging the question. You're already assuming in that case that you are the thing being hit. Why do you assume you are a body? Just because pain happens does not mean it is you. What if you are a thing which cannot feel pain but mistook yourself for a thing that can? How would you know?
</p>

<p>
	Question the basics of your metaphysics.

<p>
	Those are called Kriyas.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter. The body/mind bio-machine is just rewiring itself and working stuff out. Let it happen naturally, don't cling to it, don't get wowed or distracted by it, and carry on with your practices with your eye on the ball: Truth/Enlightenment
</p>

<p>
	Basically, no matter what happens during spiritual practice you just keep doing the practice. Unless it gets so bad that you cannot function, then you can ease up on the practice for a bit, but then get back into it. There are lots of potential side effects and none of them really matter other than as signs that you are growing.

</p>

<p>
	You're overthinking it. Stop listening to all the stories you've heard about 5-MeO and just go based on your direct experience. If you haven't tried it you have no idea what it will do and nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is quite beautiful, peaceful, benevolent, and straight-forward as far as psychedelics go. At least for me. For me it has the least potential for weird, twisted trips. It's just a pure increase in consciousness. No funny business.
</p>

<p>
	If you can handle Ayahausca you can handle 5-MeO.
</p>

			I've thought about quite a bit myself. I often hear awakened beings say things like nonduality cannot be explained, only pointed to. I acknowledge that has been true for thousands of years - yet I question whether that is an assumption. What if in 200 years all beings are in nondual states? It was not a mindset people had to work years and years to reach. People are born and raised into it. If that was "normal" would not a method of communication arise? Perhaps hyper-intuition would serve as a "language".

	No! All communication is dualistic.

<p>
	It is an idea but it is also a state of consciousness. Which is why it's so difficult to drop. It doesn't really go away even if you stop thinking for a few minutes. Because there is an entire egoic state of consciousness which makes it feel as though you are real.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of deconstructing and focused concentration to break down that egoic state of consciousness.

That would be the ultimate integration.
</p>

<p>
	Take smaller doses and don't lay down or close your eyes during trips and you should see it.

<p>
	Try contemplating: What is form? while you do this.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You need to distinguish awakening itself from changes to one's sensory field. Psychedelics tend to alter the sensory field a lot as well as produce awakening. It is possible to awaken without any change to the sensory field at all. And this is usually the case in non-psychedelic awakening. Or it's possible to have radical changes to the sensory field, such as the entire sensory field disappearing or morphing into fractals and all sorts of other stuff like a DMT alien hyperspace landscape.
</p>

<p>
	If you are in pure void with no sensory field at all, then that would be pure void. Obviously there's nothing there. No perceptions, no forms at all. Like deep sleep. Obviously there are no colors and shapes in deep sleep.
</p>

<p>
	BUT! That is not strictly necessary for awakening. You can awaken without your sensory field changing at all. In fact, you can realize that "the void" is ALWAYS the case! Even when the sensory field is fully here, it is still void. The sensory field is not other than void.
</p>

<p>
	All of these possibilities are possible with or without psychedelics. But with psychedelics you are much more likely to get radical alterations of the sensory field.
</p>

<p>
	There is no perceiver. The perceiver would be the ego or sense of self or "you", which does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	Perceptions exist in an empty vacuum or void. This void is the "True Self" or God. This void is not seperate from the perceptions themselves. Perception ARE the void! Which is just another way of saying that perceptions happen to no one.
</p>

<p>
	God is no one.
</p>

<p>
	The feeling that there is a perciever is the chief delusion that must be deconstructed.

<p>
	There is a causal strange loop relationship between sense organs and perceptions. Sense organs are themselves perceptions which have a global affect on other perceptions. If you lose an eye, your perceptions will never be the same.
</p>

<p>
	No self and universal Self are identical.
</p>

<p>
	Appearances don't need to dissolve. Appearances are already nothing. Nothing is not merely an empty space. It is that, but it is also all matter, form, shape, color, etc. The very room you are sitting in is what Nothing looks like! Nonduality means that the distinction between something and nothing is relative and must ultimately collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the bubble dissolves in deep sleep but you currently lack the consciousness necessary to know the deep sleep state. After a deep awakening you can be conscious even during deep sleep. It will be a consciousness of formless infinity.
</p>

<p>
	I explained intelligence in the What Is Intelligence video. Intelligence is an aspect of consciousness. The universe has infinite intelligence, which it used to design itself.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	What you presently think of as "bad luck" is actually likely the result of egoic ways in which you live your life. Which can be changed.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is NOT an accident. There is a big component of it which is self-inflicted. So starting thinking about how to change your ways to align more with truth, goodness, love, and selflessness.

</p>

<p>
	That's one good way.
</p>

<p>
	But there are many ways!
</p>

<p>
	Like the Shamanic Breathing technique I shared in the Shamanic Breathing video.
</p>

<p>
	Or the yoga I shared in the The Important Of Real Yoga video.
</p>

<p>
	Or psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	I've shared dozens of the best techniques with you.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the most powerful technique ever if you use them right. You could use them to deprogram all your viruses over time.
</p>

<p>
	All of the questions being asked in this thread could be answered with a couple of solid psychedelic trips. During a psychedelic trip you can literally communicate with the universe and ask it any questions you want, and you will get more reliable answers then from the best human gurus, because a human guru can only talk, not show you. A psychedelic can actually modify your field of consciousness to show you the answer.

	Think of the mind like a computer hard drive. The hard drive can get loaded with all sorts of viruses and bad programs which then need to be uninstalled and defragmented. That is the function of therapeutic and self-help techniques. They make the computer run smoother.

<p>
	Obviously a computer doesn't need to have an "I" for this to happen. Neither does your brain/mind.

<p>
	It's a real thing and you can do it if you want. But if you do it in a repressive, neurotic, or egoic way, it will backfire on you.
</p>

<p>
	Sexual desires must be genuinely transcended through spiritual work. You cannot just suppress or deny them mechanically without expecting problems. Which is why many of these no-fap people and Catholic priests suffer & struggle so much. They are doing it dogmatically.

	You're conflating types with stages.
</p>

<p>
	Regardless of your type (Myers-Briggs, Enneagram, masculine/feminine, etc) you can be at various stages of Spiral development.
</p>

<p>
	You can be a 5 Blue, 5 Orange, 5 Green, 5 Yellow, 5 Turquoise just like you can be a feminine Blue, feminine Orange, feminine Green, feminine Yellow, feminine Turquoise.

	The bottom line is, you will not have the perserverence to master a thing unless you enjoy doing it. There has to be an underlying love/passion/fascination. It just isn't always glaring when you start.

	Check out the LP course. It will change your life as far as building a career goes.

<p>
	Of course you only came into existence about 2-3 years after the birth of that thing you call a body.
</p>

<p>
	But still, it is possible to recall memories prior to the ego's creation. There are techniques for recalling memories when "your" body was in "your" mother's womb.
</p>

<p>
	Memory is an independent variable from ego.
</p>

<p>
	The brain struggles to recall memories before 3 years of age. They are still there, but just very difficult to access. Shamanic breathing can help you access them.
</p>

<p>
	And this doesn't even get into the whole issue of accessing past lives, which some folks claim is doable.
</p>

<p>
	If you notice, dreams commonly reveal your deep-seated fears. Especially if the same dream keeps happening over and over again. This is an opportunity for you to learn your lesson and resolve your fear. Then the dream will stop repeating and you will get more advanced dreams. Keep learning the lesson from each one until eventually you purify yourself of all your fears.

	It's due to the academia part.
</p>

<p>
	Academia has its head up its own ass. To maintain its status as the arbiters of "truth", academia must dismiss everything non-academia as unscientific BS. Which itself is unscientific BS.
</p>

<p>
	This attitude is a cancer of the mind.

<p>
	I've never had any knee pain in my life.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out for your fantasies, assumptions, and projections about me.
</p>

<p>
	Best not to talk about someone you don't know as if you know him.
</p>

<p>
	And it's a bad idea to do things on people without their permission.
</p>

<p>
	Be care with the New Age rabbit hole. It contains lots of potential for self-deception and delusion in the name of spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Which is not to say Reiki doesn't work. Just don't get carried away into fantasy-land about it.

<title>Is consciousness more than just sensory perception?</title>

Pure consciousness is not a thing. It is blank, void, nothing. It is like the hole in your coffee cup. You're asking: "Can a pure hole exist without a coffee cup?" Yes, except it is then no longer a hole as you've always thought of it. It is just infinite emptiness.

<title>The ABSOLUTE can be known by ITs Qualities</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/27531-the-absolute-can-be-known-by-its-qualities/?do=findComment&amp;comment=313630</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The Absolute has no qualities, which is identical to it having all qualities.
</p>

<p>
	All qualities are qualities of the Absolute. So literally any quality you can think of is a quality of the Absolute. Which is precisely why nothing can be said of the Absolute because to say it has one quality but not another is to misrepresent it.
</p>

<p>
	It is infinite, finite, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	It is small, big, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	It is eternal, temporal, both, and neither.
</p>

<p>
	And so on down the line.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind cannot hold all of these qualities at once. For that, you would have to exit the mind and literally become the entire universe. Which is possible, but not within the realm of speech or conventional "knowledge." You'd have to leave those behind.
</p>

<p>
	That's gonna be true of most work environments. The search for Truth is the opposite of doing everyday work.
</p>

<p>
	Even the work I do for Actualized.org is counter-productive for seeking Truth. In fact, very much so. Because work is just not about that. Work is a survival function, which is the opposite of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem I see with programming is that it consigns you to sit at a computer terminal for 8 hours per day for 40 years. But then again, lots of work does that these days. I spend much of my time on a computer. So....

			So for example, I would actually have my own understanding of the terms you mention above.

	<li>

	</li>
	<li>

<p>

<p>
	All fear is fear of losing one's self/identity.
</p>

<p>
	So of course people fear intimacy & deep union with others. Other is the very thing you need to differentiate yourself from in order to be a self.
</p>

<p>
	Self/other is the ultimate conceptual duality which birthed you into existence.
</p>

<p>
	You were literally born the moment you thought: "self here, other there." And you've been under this delusion for your entire life.
</p>

<p>
	Stop running away from feeling emotions. Do the opposite and push yourself to feel more deeply. The purpose of being alive is to FEEL everything! Stop being picky about where it feels good or bad. Just fucking FEEL! Make it your mission to feel the shit out of everything regardless of what it is.
</p>

	God also DOES have a body. Your body, and every body that has every existed for every creature. Those are all literally God's body.
</p>

<p>
	God is a shapeshifter, a thing which inhabits infinite forms. Which is why God is difficult for people to see. They keep looking for God as one concrete thing, this or that, but God is ALL THINGS!
</p>

<p>
	The hardest thing to see is that which is everywhere you look and the eyes with which you are looking.

</p>

<p>
	You certainly don't have to know about kundalini or actively try to awaken it to become enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	I would distinguish between activated kundalini and enlightenment. You can have one or the other or both or neither.
</p>

<title>Teal Swan on human connection being the way to Enlightenment?</title>

<p>
	It's very very unlikely to make you enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 requirement for enlightenment is laser focus for hours on end.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why the most enlightened sages were hermits and recluses. "Human stuff" is a giant distraction.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing wrong with building deep relationships, but it will get you mired deep in human stuff when you want to be delving into metaphysical stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You can also do both, by scheduling 10-day solo retreats throughout the year. This way you can have relationships without going full-monk, but you can also get some of that monk experience. This is probably the ideal for most people, unless you're really drawn to go full-monk.
</p>

<p>
	Anyhow, all those humans are none other than yourself. There is no one here but you. God is forever alone.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, unless someone told you stages of development are a thing, you would never know about them no matter how enlightened you got.
</p>

<p>
	You will never encounter a developmental stage during meditation.

And it does not happen automagically.
</p>

<p>
	We develop ourselves only if we do.
</p>

<p>
	Development does not imply an I.

</p>

<p>
	Don't try to be too cozy with your family. Go create your own life.
</p>

<p>
	If your family will disown you for dating someone you love, fuck them. They don't really love you then.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to hate them. Just create some distance. You have the right to live however you want.

<p>
	The distinction is very simple:
</p>

<p>
	Addictive, yes or no?
</p>

<p>
	If yes, do not use.
</p>

<p>
	I do not condone caffeine for this reason. I would never recommend an addictive or harmful substance like ketamine, antidepressants, or opioids.

<p>
	Western values aren't superior. You can reach high stages of the Spiral under different value systems.
</p>

<p>
	There can be stage Turquoise Islam or Hinduism or Japanese values.
</p>

<p>
	To think that Western culture is superior to Hindu culture is brazenly ignorant and self-biased. A person could only hold that position because they have not studied Hindu culture. Hindu culture is extremely advanced in certain ways, like spiritually.
</p>

<p>
	A 6th grader is not superior to a 2nd grader. They are just at different levels of growth. One had a head start. Don't mistake that for superiority.
</p>

<p>
	All superiority is relative anyways. Superior according to who? Superior towards what end?
</p>

<p>
	You can't really talk someone out of ignorance. They must outgrow it by experiencing new perspectives and experiences which shatter their limited enthocentric worldview.
</p>

<p>
	A great way to become Green is through travel to exotic non-Western countries. Watch some Anthony Bourdain.

	You are treating it as a means to another end, while I am talking about being a bricklayer as its own end.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine you laid bricks for the rest of your life. Not to advance to some other position, but just because you loved the art of laying bricks.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously bricklaying is not YOUR LP since you want to do big picture stuff, but that is not clear for OP.

<p>
	In practice Orange is still not far enough out of Blue. Orange will have a sense of superiority and insensitivity.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the US Constitution was a stage Orange document crafted by stage Orange elites, but it still tolerated slavery.
</p>

<p>
	Folks like Sam Harris or JP still hold a sort of sense of "Western culture and values are superior" which is not quite racism, but it is still a subtle sense of superiority and self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	Orange still doesn't grasp the full extent of relativity. Orange still believes in objective external truths. As if there is one way the world is.

</p>

<p>
	Even 150ug can kick your ass. So watch out.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds to me like you're asking for a bad trip because your attitude towards this substance is way too light.
</p>

<p>
	300ug outdoors can go really wrong. This doesn't mean it will go wrong every time, but it certainly CAN go very wrong unless you are extremely careful and know what you are doing. If you do it a dozen times, I can almost guarantee something will go wrong. So watch out. You are playing with a loaded gun.

You can become conscious of pretty much anything permanently.
</p>

<p>
	But it will take a lot of focused work in most cases.
</p>

<p>
	Of course your neurology will be a limit a lot of times, but you can change your neurology both through external and internal means (like psychedelics and diet or yoga and long meditation sits).
</p>

<p>
	The point is that spiritual practice of any kind rewires your brain. Psychedelics and meditation ultimately do the same thing, one is just more short-acting while the other is more long-acting.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are also more powerful because they can change your neurology is crazy ways, but the effects are rarely permanent (which is actually a good thing) otherwise you could really damage yourself with a bad trip.
