Don't forget there are genuine stage Blue Christians who are decent folks and aren't necessarily wrapped up in luxury or materialism.
</p>

<p>
	But today the mixture of Blue & Orange is very popular in rural parts of the US.

<p>
	Yes, he's very good at teaching how to love.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know if merely saying such things will trigger an awakening. To be safe you'd want to supplement with psychedelics or other methods. But of course such affirmations and visualizations can be great.

<p>
	Unfortunately catastrophe will not push people towards Green, it will do the opposite. A serious survival threat will push people down one or two levels.

<p>
	Which is what we're seeing with Trump of the North and Trump of the South. The angrier people get, the worse leaders they elect.

		</p>

		<p>
			How can one recognise love and Love?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course.
</p>

<p>
	Lowercase love is ordinary human love as an emotion. It is limited and conditional. It has an opposite: hate.
</p>

<p>
	Uppercase Love is an Absolute with no opposite. It is the substrate of all existence. It includes love + hate and everything else. It is not an emotion although it can trigger strong emotions of lowercase love.
</p>

<p>
	Uppercase Love is a mystical awakening. It is a kind of enlightenment. This is usually a combination of feeling loving + insight into the nature of what existence is. Afterwards although you may not feel loving all the time, you still know that all of existence is Love. Love no longer is limited to a personal feeling. You can feel angry and still know it is a form of Love.
</p>

<p>
	The highest feelings you get which motivate your life are a little taste of Love. But just a little taste. You will recognize the full scope of Love the moment you realize you just died.
</p>

<p>
	Love = Death
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Creation cannot occur without destruction. So by judging or demonizing one, you unwittingly shoot yourself in the foot and reject the large totality of reality.
</p>

<p>
	If you hate any aspect of reality, you are hating yourself, which means you are disconnected from God's Love and your vision is clouded by ego & delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Total enlightenment robs you of the ability to judge reality. Sorry. I know how much you love to hate, but that shit won't fly if you want to reach the highest levels of understanding.

			Hey Leo, my question is:
		</p>

		<p>
			Why is it important for us, egos, to blind ourselves to absolute love through survival?<br />
			What purpose, function, does this blinding serve from the "point of view" of absolute love?<br />
			How does this blinding serve the egos and absolute love itself?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Without survival you could not experience anything. So survival is the #1 requirement of any kind of formed existence.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose is to have you experience the multiplicity of Creation, the formed world.
</p>

<p>
	You are just like a droplet of water which has to break off from the ocean, fly up into the air, and then re-merge with the ocean. The purpose of this is to experience what it's like to be separated from the ocean and then to rediscover what it's like to be the ocean. You can't appreciate being the whole ocean without first breaking off and being a drop.

	It's so funny how today's most passionate Chrsitians would be the first to make the anti-Christ their dear leader.
</p>

<p>
	God is so deliciously twisted!
</p>

<p>
	When the anti-Christ comes he will definitely come blowing a bugle in the name of God.

	The highest form of Love is most detached. Attachment limits love. But it is easier for egos to do attached love.

<p>
	That was a good start. You must deepen your appreciation for life. Keep at it.
</p>

<p>
	You are surrounded by infinite beauty all day long. You just gotta train yourself to appreciate it. Survival rips your attention away from the beauty of being.

			Hey Leo.  I have a question... sometimes I have seen the power of love turn around negative relationships.  Like when people have treated me badly I turned around and treated them well and it eventually led them to them treating me well too.  Other times it has felt like I have let others abuse me or have felt like I gave too much to the point of feeling bad and having to close down and pull back.
		</p>

		<p>
			I feel its a fine line and I try to err on the side of giving and loving more.   
		</p>

		<p>
			Its like being open and vulnerable is a beautiful thing that can do wonders in many situations but sometimes it feels like you over expose yourself to others who might hurt you.
		</p>

		<p>
			I feel like when you are totally alligned you can just bulldoze your way through everything with love transforming and uplifting people´s energy as you go but other times I have felt like I am just kidding myself and just overgiving or sacrificing.
		</p>

		<p>
			I guess honest communication with yourself and with others is the way to go, but its hard to know sometimes in the middle of a situation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any thoughts on navigating this?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice I think it's always going to be tricky. Relationships are soaked through with survival issues so there's always a give and take dynamic. A careful dynamic balance is required. See my video on the issue of Balance.
</p>

<p>
	Think of relationships like surfing. You're balancing dynamically so it's always temporary victories and occasional wipe outs. But the more you practice the better you get and the less wipe outs you have.
</p>

<p>
	Relationships definitely require setting some boundaries. You can't just be lovey-dovey all the time. Setting boundaries is part of Love. But of course being more empathetic and unconditionally loving of yourself and your partner generally helps. Most relationships are ruined with judgment, criticism, and disrespect.
</p>

<p>
	Those are just two different ways of framing the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Learning how to love is about eliminating various judgments and selfish attachments. But it can also be proactive. Just, like, practice loving things more! It can be that simple.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	What happened there was by reading that sign, your small picture was expanded to a bigger picture. As the picture got bigger is put otherwise ugly & bad things into proper context, thus erasing the badness and ugliness.
</p>

<p>
	Now imagine that extrapolated to the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	My claim is this: if you adopt a large enough picture, every action that has ever occurred or will ever occur in the universe will be seen as an expression of Absolute Love. But you need to seriously expand your picture. It's far too small. In fact, your picture must become infinite.
</p>

<p>
	The only way is to realize that you ARE Love. This results in total absolute self-acceptance and self-love. Since you are God, your love for yourself is Absolute and unlimited. Since you are God, no one can love you but yourself. If you cannot love & accept yourself, no one else can and you are forever doomed by your own self-denial and self-hatred until you realize that self-love is the only true love.

<p>
	Religion is highly corrupt. The devil has co-opted all religion to use as a control mechanism. Fear (of Hell) is a powerful control mechanism. Many humans do no know how to follow basic rules of decency unless they are threatened with eternal Hell.
</p>

<p>
	When a child misbehaves, the easiest way to make it behave is to threaten it with a beating. Then the child quickly falls in line and obeys. Like a dog. This is the level that many people function at.

			Can Love be maximized - if Everything is Love?

		<p>
			Is metaphysical love distinct from Absolute Love and common conditional love?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is where things necessarily get paradoxical.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, everything IS Love. But also, what is includes everything that is occurring at all levels and orders or reality. So just like at the order of atoms, that is Love, at the order of human social activities, that is love. So when the US bombs targets in the Middle East, the bombs are literally made out of love and with love, and they are dropped out of love -- despite the fact that they kill innocent civilians.
</p>

<p>
	This is so because there is a bigger picture to the universe which transcends the death of any one living being, no matter how innocent. The ego of course hates this idea and vehemently denies it. Because it's too dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	Love is maximized precisely BECAUSE everything is love!
</p>

<p>
	Metaphysical is just another word I use for Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Common conditional love is just a very narrow version of Absolute Love. It is like Absolute Love diluted to 0.00000001%. What makes it conditional is the desire for survival. Humans don't love unconditionally because it's far too dangerous. If you loved a grizzly bear unconditionally it might eat you.
</p>

<p>
	Attachment to survival requires modulation of unconditional love because survival is by definition conditional! You need certain conditions to be alive. So you are in an existential bind. You must either choose survival or unconditional love. For most people this isn't even a choice. Survival dictates the choosing of survival. Otherwise you couldn't be here to make the choice. It's the ultimate catch-22.
</p>

<p>
	Appreciation of the person's innate beauty. Not physical beauty or function. But the beauty of their totality of being.
</p>

<p>
	When you can look Hitler in the eye and see his beauty, there is your love.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. You are still free to kill him. Love and killing are not opposite. Seeing the beauty of a thing says nothing about what you should do from a survival perspective. You can see the beauty of cancer, but then decide to destroy the cancer. Destruction is part of the total beauty of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Try this: The next time you want to kill a house fly, first, stop for moment and admire it's beauty. Then kill it and admire the beauty inherent in the destruction. Notice that without destruction there could not be life. Admire the beauty of your internal conflict and moral deliberations about killing that fly. That too is love. You feel bad because you wish you could love that fly. Yet you also know you needed to kill that fly because you cannot allow a house full of dirty flies and maggots. Admire the beauty of survival. Yours and the fly's. Admire the inherent conflict between the two of you. Let the magnitude of it hit you. Imagine yourself as the fly being killed. Notice the sad beauty of that too.

<p>
	Survival dominates your life. Universal Love can be counter-productive to your survival.
</p>

<p>
	But also it's not so elusive. You love certain stuff all day long. You go to lunch and you love it. You jerk off and you love it. You watch Netflix and you love. You see a sunset and you love it. Your dog licks your face and you love it. You take a big shit and you love it. You earn some money and you love it. You crash on the couch after a long day and you love it. You read some profound book and you love it. You take a hot shower and your body loves it.
</p>

<p>
	If your life didn't have love in it, you would kill yourself pretty soon.

<p>
	What is the universe doing as a whole? Forget about individual people or atoms. What is the ENTIRE thing up to? Is it just a random mess of stuff? No! It's doing something intelligent. Consider the possibility that what it's doing is maximizing the expression of metaphysical love. If this were true, you can see how the movement of every atom would contribute to that ultimate goal in the same way that every atom in your computer's hard drive is contributing to the function of the hard drive storing data.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The materialist paradigm goes very deep. I think many people just assume that reality cannot be loving because it must be neutral or empty or mechanical and impersonal.
</p>

<p>
	Love is a distinct awakening that one must have. Some people, especially masculine men who tend to skew towards autistic may have a limited ability to realize love. Many men have closed hearts or avoid emotional expressiveness.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I'm not sure if a clinical psychopath can realize Love. My guess is he can, but he's just not very likely to.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston's style is very reductionistic, clinical, masculine. It's that classic sort of Zen style. But this is only one style of spirituality. It's not Truth per se. It's a style. It's one expression of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	But honestly I don't know why he doesn't get it. That's a good question that requires some scientific research.
</p>

<p>
	I am planning several new videos on the topic of Love.
</p>

<p>
	I will be addressing many common questions, objections, and misconceptions in those videos.
</p>

<p>
	So if you have a <u>genuine</u> question or objection about what Love is, why it's important, or how it works, ask here.
</p>

<p>
	I'm looking for genuine questions from your direct experience, not trolling or devil's advocate games.
</p>

<p>
	Your question may not be answered in this thread. But there's a good chance it may be answered in the new videos.
</p>

This would keep people from stockpiling weapons they don't use for hunting/sport. That money could then be funneled to mental health, gun training programs, suicide prevention, and helping victims of shootings. It would be a like a gun insurance pool.

<p>
	Stage Blue has authoritarian tendencies. Because they like to follow a strong leader. So once a strong leader emerges by conquering everyone else, Blue falls in line and conforms.
</p>

<p>
	Blue loves, loves, loves conformity. It gives Blue a sense of security & comfort.
</p>

<p>
	Blue loves unambiguous black & white leadership style. Like in the military. Everyone knows his rank and knows exactly what is expected of him.
</p>

<p>
	Blue makes excellent soldiers because they are so loyal. Of course the problem is, Blue also makes excellent Nazis.

			You seem to put more effort/emphasis in communicating/teaching True Love than something like True Perfection. If this is so, why? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well of course what one chooses to emphasize when teaching is rather subjective and arbitrary.
</p>

<p>
	I am interested in teaching all aspects of the Absolute. But this makes the teaching far more complex. And it requires time to roll the teaching out.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that what you see of my teaching is a very early version, a work in progress that isn't even 10% complete. So when the full teaching is complete 10-20 years from now, then you can nitpick what I left out. But when you finally see the full teaching, you'll be more than satisfied.
</p>

<p>
	Love & Perfection as so closely related that it's not a big deal. When speaking you're gonna have to choose one framing vs another. All speech is limited and cannot fully capture what needs to be said.
</p>

<p>
	More practically, Love is something ordinary people can resonate with and learn to practice in their daily lives. Videos on that coming soon.
</p>

<p>
	Contrary to Love being some philosophical abstraction, Love is the fastest way to get people onto the spiritual path. People have a deep intuitive feel for love. Love cuts through the rational mind. If you've ever deeply loved another being, you'll understand how much God loves you and how powerful Love is. There is no power higher than your capacity to love. Love overcomes every single obstacle.
</p>

<p>
	All meaning is a construction of the mind. You are creating it while not realizing you are creating it.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't make meaning good or bad. It just is what it is. Become aware of how you create meaning.

Many people will disagree with this as the ego wants to put relative conditions on what is Perfect. "How can a car with flat tires be Perfect??!!". Yet this hijacks True Perfection for conditional perfection. In doing so, one cannot realize True Perfection. It seems like something similar is going on with True Love and conditional love - yet this may be even harder to realize since humans seem to be much more attached/identified to conditional love.

<p>
	Yes. Perfection, Paradise, Heaven, etc.
</p>

<p>
	But Love is yet distinct from Perfection.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot reduce Love down to anything else, even though Love is identical to Truth / Being / Consciousness / Nothingness
</p>

<p>
	There are aspects of the Absolute even though it is ONE.

<p>
	And yes, there will be many videos about loving coming soon.
</p>

<p>
	It takes time to explain all these things methodically.

<p>
	This is precisely incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	You guys need to appreciate that I am pointing to something deeper which you are as yet missing.
</p>

<p>
	I would not make such a big deal out of this if it wasn't really fucking important.
</p>

<p>
	Not all spiritual paths lead to the same place. Some paths and teachings lead deeper than others.
</p>

<p>
	If I am emphasizing something to this degree, it's not a mere word game, it's something massive you're missing.
</p>

<p>
	I can lead a donkey to water, but I cannot make you drink.
</p>

<p>
	The word Love is used precisely because that's what it is. No other word is correct for this aspect of consciousness. To use other words just to appeal to egos would be a corruption of the highest truth.
</p>

<p>
	This corruption comes from lack of understanding. The truth is just too radical for people to accept. Even so called enlightened people. They can still deny love.
</p>

<p>
	How can God reveal itself to you when you are so adamant in denying it?
</p>

			Wrong. Byron Katie has talked about how she would, at random times, have her consciousness transferred to a building, and it would remain there for some time. She had similar experiences with seagulls, where her consciousness would just transfer to the seagull and remain for some time. And she did not take psychedelics.

<p>
	Many people live with a lot of repressed emotional baggage and truama that they have been in denial about for years.
</p>

<p>
	It can be painful to open those old wounds.
</p>

<p>
	But this is by no means unique to psychedelics. Intense meditation can also cause such problems.
</p>

<p>
	Purifying the mind is not always a walk in the park. Especially if you have a dirty mind.

	From what I understand grenade launcher attachments for AR-15's are still legal and easily obtainable. But the grenade rounds are illegal and hard to find. It varies a lot by state. California banned a lot of stuff. But Nevada is like the wild wild west. We have the laxest gun laws in the country.

<p>
	Aliveness it not what I mean though. Love is not the same as aliveness. Love is a very distinct realization.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, of course people equate love with human emotion, in the same way that they equate perception with a human creature. The ego precisely co-opts such terms, corrupting them to partial, limited, dualistic notions.
</p>

<p>
	It is impossible to comprehend Infinite Love from the ego's POV. From the ego's POV, Infinite Love is death. It cannot be allowed at any cost. It must be denied, denied, denied. The devil will never admit that the universe is made of pure Love.

<p>
	What you're not yet understanding is that conflict is necessary and inevitable, even within spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot have a spiritual school without boundaries and conflict. This has never happened in human history and it never will because the relative domain is necessarily dualistic and exclusionary. There cannot be a fully inclusive teaching because it would become totally corrupt and ineffective. Effectiveness itself is a bias which must be enforced through exclusion.
</p>

<p>
	This problem goes away beyond personal ego or some local dispute between two teachers. This is an existential problem which can only be appreciated after deep contemplation of it. Ask yourself what conflict is and why necessarily occurs. While you're at it, ask yourself what boundaries are and why social organizations must have them.

<p>
	But it's not brain chemicals which did that to you, but rather the imagination of Infinite Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Chemicals are nothing more than images held in Infinite Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between reality and imagination. ALL OF THIS is a figment of your imagination. And furthermore, you are imagining that you aren't imagining it. So you believe it's "real". Stop imagining it is real and it will stop being real.

<p>
	Yes, it's absolutely crucial that you surrender all desire for personal power or personal gain.
</p>

<p>
	My working theory is, personal desires for power will block you from access to the highest power. This is like a safety mechanism to prevent devils from screwing up reality.

<p>
	Realistically you cannot trick your way out of this problem. You must do the practices, have multiple awakenings, and do further practices to weed out all attachments, cravings, aversions, fears, clinging, etc.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, by doing all of the Actualized work & practices you can, one day, get to a point where you will be unshakable. But also, to await such a point is going to create more suffering. Happiness can never be found in the future. It exists only NOW! But in order to fully surrender to the NOW you have to spend some years doing practices to calm down your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga, psychedelics, self-inquiry, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Basically meditation teaches you authentic happiness. The happiness of NOW.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	But still it seems people can get some powers like the various siddhis, so it is just a question of degree. The question is how much power can on gain? I don't see why there would be some hard boundary. It just seems to get harder and harder to change more fundamental aspects of reality, like the gravitational constant of the whole universe. It's obvious why mystics aren't allowed to change that willy-nilly.
</p>

<p>
	Also, from my experiences, at high enough levels of consciousness you become so hyper conscious that you literally stop being human and become God itself. In that state you seem to have access to many of its powers because you become it. It is no longer your human will that is at work at that point.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Every spiritual school has rules you must play by. Welcome to society.
</p>

<p>
	If anything my rules are too lax and too accommodating of diverse perspectives. This tolerance gets abused by devils.
</p>

<p>
	But I have some limits. Undercutting the highest truth I know cannot fly here. If someone wants to teach that there is no God, that love is just an emotion, that psychedelics are delusion... well... they will have to start their own school. Not in my school.
</p>

<p>
	I hold WinterKnight to a higher standard because he is here in a teaching capacity and representing enlightenment. I would have less problem with it if he was just making random comments as a non-teacher.
</p>

<p>
	In the future I will be screening people on this forum harder when they claim to be enlightened in order to maintain the integrity of these teachings. A lot of people come here, claim to be enlightened, and then they're off to the races with their twisted and half-baked views.

</blockquote>

<p>
	1) Your awakenings were not nearly deep enough, requiring much more embodiment work.
</p>

<p>
	2) Your desire to feel good is never going to work. You cannot use spirituality to feel good. Rather, what spirituality teaches you is that no matter how bad you feel, that is good. This is very counter-intuitive. The ego wants to lock in a happy state. This is not only impossible but it is the very cause of your unhappiness. Happiness is total acceptance of whatever is happening in the present moment. That means if you're getting tortured, you accept it without trying to escape it. The desire to escape suffering is the very thing which creates suffering.

<p>
	Because this is not as slight a difference as you think, and because this problem, while small now, will only grow larger and larger with my newer teachings until it comes to a head.
</p>

<p>
	I have a very specific teaching I want to offer the world. I created this platform to offer this teaching because I knew that no other platform would allow me to teach what I need to teach.

</p>

<p>
	If what you say was true they would have just gone off to die in the wildness and no one would have known their name.
</p>

<p>
	Jesus' and Buddha's manipulations are still rippling through consciousness to this day!

<p>
	Absolutely
</p>

<p>
	There are things consciousness can do on drugs that you cannot even being to imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine becoming a rock and existing for 1 billion years, then returning back to human form. Stuff like that is possible and no meditation will ever get you there. You won't even know you missed it even if you become highly enlightened through meditation.

<p>
	That's because most people do drugs recreationally to escape. They have no serious spiritual ambitions or understanding of nonduality or spirituality or psychology or anything. It's kids fooling around.
</p>

<p>
	It's as if you've seen kids playing with finger paints and then you say that it's not possible to paint the Mona Lisa with paints.
</p>

<p>
	It matters very much the skill of the person handling the paint.

<p>
	Yes but then how do you handle a situation where an atheist comes into the temple and starts teaching atheism and nihilism?
</p>

<p>
	It is tricky to handle that because you're damned if you kick him out and damned if you don't.
</p>

<p>
	And that's precisely the problem of how do you handle ignorance? It's not easy. You cannot escape fragmention in the relative world. You can be super enlightened but fragmentation will still happen to you. It will be thrust upon you. As God you are doomed to forever keep dividing yourself.

<p>
	People will attack you just for speaking the truth.

<p>
	After enough trips you realize that your whole life is one long trip, so the distinction disappears.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference really between being high and sober other than that you are much more conscious of your full capacities when high.
</p>

<p>
	God and Love are always present. It's just a question of how disconnected one is from it.

<p>
	Yes, it is very hard.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it does point to deeper systemic economic problems which need to be reformed.
</p>

<p>
	But, it can still be done. Success requires a lot of trial and error and persistence. Remember, you only need one thing to pan out. All those courses have laid some foundation. Now you're ready to pounce on some new opportunity.
</p>

<p>
	Success in business requires being opportunistic and creative. You can't just copy what everyone else is doing. You must always be on the lookout for your niche. Always be thinking about how you can provide massive value to the world.

			Have you considered that all this talk about love and fireworks is result of taking psychodelics and don't have much to do with enlightement which is simply what is ?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Love is simply what is.
</p>

<p>
	If you are a serious student of spiritual texts and teachings, you know that the best of them talk about love. It has nothing to do with fireworks or psychedelics. Psychedelics simply show you your deepest nature -- if you have the courage to look at yourself in your rawest form.
</p>

<p>
	The reason some of guys have a hard time buying this whole love business it because you're still thinking of reality from the materialist paradigm. This paradigm can extremely subtle, such that even people who have an awakening or two -- such as Sam Harris -- still have not transcended it. According to materialism, the universe must be neutral, impersonal, and devoid of any sentimentality. This is a hyper-logical, hyper-masculine, reductionistic way of understanding reality. And it is untrue.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is Love. It is not dumb matter or energy or even "simply what is". What is, is LOVE! And why it is, is LOVE!
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to underestimate God's goodness. That is the key mistake here. God is not neutral as you might assume.
</p>

	Yes, but also be careful not to develop a blaming victim complex on this issue. If you want a passionate job, you can work to create one based around your LP. It's challenging but worthwhile. Become a massive value provider, a powerful creator.

<p>
	The point of such abilities, besides the pure understanding of them, is to move mankind to greater self-realization.
</p>

<p>
	Altering the illusion is totally unnecessary. And yet if you could move more people to realize love, that would be the highest motivation, and you would do whatever is in your power towards that end.

<p>
	Yup, that accords with my own experiences with psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	At some point, after enough trips, you'll work through all of your personal psychological baggage and all that will remain are deeper and deeper levels of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	There is no one to heal because everything is Perfection. And, yet, the world is badly in need of healing. That's the paradox.
</p>

<p>
	Being a healer also does not require being a shaman or using psychedelics. The are many ways to heal the world. Just by talking to people about awakening is already healing the world. Just by raising your children well, that is helping to heal the world.

</p>

<p>
	It's said by some yogis that you need like 10,000 pranayamas to enter a deep samadhi effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
	I don't recall the exact number. It's mentioned in one of the books.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this number should not be taken too literally. It will differ for each person. But it gives you a rough idea of how many pranayamas you're aiming for. So do a shitload of them.

<p>
	No, you're misquoting me.
</p>

<p>
	I said:
</p>

<p>
	Being = perception - ego
</p>

<p>
	Being = experience - ego
</p>

<p>
	Truth = perception - ego
</p>

<p>
	Truth = experience - ego
</p>

<p>
	Truth = Being
</p>

<p>
	Perception = experience
</p>

<p>
	These distinctions are subtle but important. Remember, I am not saying that colors and sounds will disappear. They will still be around. But they will get recontextualized.
</p>

<p>
	You can look at an apple and see it as an apple.
</p>

<p>
	Or you can look at an apple and see it as not an apple.
</p>

<p>
	In both cases there is a round, red shape visible. But how you interpret that shape is very significant.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at an apple while letting go of your idea that it is an apple. Just stare at it in silence.
</p>

<p>
	So what? Big deal. If you can register a car, you can register a gun.
</p>

<p>
	How come I have to register my business with the IRS but not an arsenal of 20 assault rifles? It's absurd.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse registration with a ban on guns.
</p>

<p>
	Illegal guns will always exist, but requiring registration of all new firearm purchases would help eliminate young teens from buying up guns for their sprees. Many of these mass shooters purchased a firearm within weeks or months of their spree.

			Still not sure what they mean by gun show loop holes.  Anyone with an FFL license does a back ground check on every gun sale, does not matter if it is at a gun show, a store, or private.  I think this term was made up because it sounds like it means something but it really means absolutely nothing.

<p>
	Currently you can go to a gun show and buy a gun from a private party without any background check or waiting period whatsoever. It's absurd.
</p>

<p>
	These gun shows a very problematic. Back in the 90's I was once at a gun show where they were selling flamethrowers, grenades, body armor, and all sorts of other shady stuff. That particular gun show had to be closed because of how much illegal stuff was sold there. I'm sure that kind of stuff still goes on around the country. It's not hard to go to a gun show and purchase a firing pin which will turn your semi-auto AR-15 into a fully-auto.
</p>

<p>
	I have family members who were able to purchase grenade launchers at gun shows.

	No, just do it as long as humanly possible.

	It's very important that when you do your whole routine, that it be natural and organic. Don't waste too much mental energy criticizing yourself, timing things, analyzing yourself, etc. You must enter a flow state. The whole thing must become silky smooth and effortless. Let go of any self-conscious thoughts and just follow your heart.

<p>
	Because if I don't explicitly use such examples people will not understand that torture is Love. The ego will make exceptions to unconditional love, treating "evil" things as evidence that Love isn't unconditional. The fact is, anything which seems like it's not love is a lack of holistic consciousness and a judgment of the ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	When something happens to you in life which you hate, and you want to say, "But that's not love, that's evil." Be aware that in that moment, your vision is clouded by self-bias. You hate that thing because it conflicts with your survival agenda, not because it isn't Love.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There are many ways to corrupt even the highest of spiritual teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful to distinguish Advaita from Neo-Advaita. Neo-Advaita is a watered-down Western version which is popular nowadays on Youtube and elsewhere online because it is so simple and easy, but which grossly oversimplifies what enlightenment is. Neo-Advaita is dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all spiritual teachings get corrupted on a regular basis and very few people truly understand the full depth of the highest teachings. They stop far short because the methods they use are not very effective and they have no other way of knowing what they are missing. This is precisely where psychedelics become indispensable. Psychedelics can show you new aspects of awakening which you would have probably missed.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you've reached the end, chances are you're fooling yourself. So just be careful. Don't hesitate to dig deeper.
</p>

<p>
	The irony here is that there's not real contradiction. It's just a matter of depth and comprehensiveness of understanding.

<p>
	Just do the best you can, even if it's less than 90. The idea being that you will improve over time so it's not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
	Holding your breath to 90 is quite hard when you're holding all the 3 locks. Your body will get very tense and burn through more oxygen than usual.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Conventional human love, like romantic love, or love for your family, is like the tip of an infinite iceberg. You are conscious enough to realize love for only certain objects which serve your ego's survival. But once the ego is fully dissolved you realize that conventional human love was merely the tip of the iceberg. Then you realize that EVERYTHING is love.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest love you have for your family is the love God has for all of its creation. You as a limited human feel a tiny portion of that universal unconditional love. Most of the time you are disconnected from it because you are disconnected from yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	If you were fully conscious that you are God, your love would be infinite and totally unconditional. You would not even be able to think of anything other than love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is an Absolute and has no opposite. Feeling love is not necessary for Love to be at work. Love is at work even if you are torturing a puppy.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing you can do to shake God's love. You can be the most evil, egotistical, deluded person of all time, and God will still love you.
</p>

<p>
	Love is everything that has ever "physically" occurred, that you have ever known, seen, or felt. Love is every "physical" object.
</p>

<p>
	Love is Nothing.

<p>
	Actually, I have decided to unlock this thread so those of you who wish to vent can do so here. I imagine many will want to do so.
</p>

<p>
	If you have objections to the truth of God and Love, air your doubts and grievances with me now because going forward, God and Love will be the teaching. This is not something we can just sweep under the rug.
</p>

<p>
	Speak now or forever hold your peace.

<p>
	You are God. You are omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent.
</p>

<p>
	It would help if you stopped telling yourself otherwise. Since you are God, whatever you imagine becomes true. So if you imagine you're a limited human, that's precisely what you create.

<p>
	This attitude is overly-simplistic, overly-reductionistic, & misses a giant swath of the spiritual terrain.
</p>

<p>
	To teach spirituality and not teach the metaphysical nature of Love is incorrect not only from the standpoint of doing your students a disservice, but also from the standpoint of Truth itself.
</p>

<p>
	By shutting off your mind through self-inquiry, you've disconnected yourself from the very source and purpose of existence and awakening: LOVE. Love is not an emotion or feeling. Love is identical to Truth.
</p>

<p>
	This is the danger of Neo-Advaita and Neo-Buddhism as commonly taught in the West today. The nuances and depth of awakening is lost, reduced to a binary flatland.
</p>

<p>
	I have interacted with many enlightened masters. I was once told of the following case: A modern day Buddhist came to an enlightenment self-inquiry intensive, inquirying into the question of What am I? After a few days of intense inquiry he had an awakening to Absolute Love. But he immediately rejected the awakening as inauthentic because his Buddhist dogma led them to believe that Love is not a real thing. He was trapped in looking for Nothingness. This is a mistake. The Love is right there, yet you deny it.
</p>

<p>
	We are not really in disagreement here. There are just aspects of the Absolute you have not yet become conscious of because you've over-reduced it.
</p>

<p>
	I understand that some of you guys will disagree with me. But I can only lead you as best as I know how. Whether you want to follow is up to you. Nothing said here should be taken as dogma. Discover the many facets of the Absolute for yourself. Directly! Through no human source.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I have no problem with you guys doing psychoanalysis. My only point was that psychedelics will take you deeper than any talk-therapy will. But of course you're welcome to use them both. I support the use of multiple tools.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Here's the bare minimum that I would propose:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Federal background checks on all firearm sales
	</li>
	<li>
		Closing the gun show loop holes on private sales
	</li>
	<li>
		Ban of high capacity magazines
	</li>
	<li>
		Ban of bump stocks & other such mods
	</li>
	<li>
		Ban of body armor and armor piercing rounds
	</li>
	<li>
		Red flag laws
	</li>
	<li>
		Serious training and licensing in order to buy a gun at all. Like the DMV but for guns.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ban open-carry of firearms in public places
	</li>
	<li>
		Mandatory locks for all firearms
	</li>
	<li>
		Legal liability if someone accesses your gun to shoot a person when it wasn't properly locked
	</li>
	<li>
		Federal database of all firearms purchased and some kind of limits on people amassing arsenals.
	</li>
	<li>
		Waiting periods to buy firearms. A week or more.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ban mentally ill people or domestic abusers from owning firearms.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	All of this is totally reasonable and supported by the majority of Americans and even responsible gun owners.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this will not prevent all mass shootings. But it's a good idea to have these protections in place.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	This requires raising awareness of oneself through self-reflection, contemplation, inquiry, meditation, disciplined practices, etc.

It exists as a concept.
</p>

<p>
	In the same way that Santa Claus exists conceptually.
</p>

<p>
	Which is you say, the human self is imaginary. You are imagining that you were born. This a story you tell yourself to create a sense of self.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: just because you have a thought about something -- like Santa Claus living on Mars -- doesn't mean that thought refers to anything in the real world.
</p>

<p>
	So the question is: why you assume that body is "yours"? Why isn't that body the universe's?
</p>

<p>
	See, you've confused the universe and yourself. Or to put it more accurately: the universe believes it is a human. In the Absolute sense, there is only the universe believing it is a human. The universe is trying to act human to convince itself that it is human. But it's just the universe. The human part is imaginary.

<p>
	Unfortunately this is no minor disagreement. This goes against the core of my highest teaching.
</p>

<p>
	My highest teaching is:
</p>

<p>
	1) You are God
</p>

<p>
	2) Truth = Love
</p>

<p>
	This is what I am guiding you guys to realize.
</p>

<p>
	I don't want this teaching corrupted or made shallow with neo-Advaita or Buddhism or some Jed McKenna silliness.
</p>

<p>
	What I teach is distinct from all that.

<p>
	No. This is delusion.
</p>

<p>
	You need to access nondual states of consciousness to really grow. You have not even begun human growth until you've had your first mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't mean that all spirituality boils down to chasing mystical experiences, but you need some first hand experience of samadhi states.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not inclined to be spiritual then go watch some cartoons or whatever.

</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem with people is that they are so lazy and complacent they have zero mystical experience. They do not even know this domain exists. So they have no will to meditate seriously.
</p>

<p>
	I find that spiritually adept folks do not appreciate how unspiritual average folks are. Just keep that in mind. Because you walked this path sober you have an highly unusual degree of baseline awareness, wisdom, and motivation -- which 99% of people do not have.

<p>
	You are wrong.
</p>

<p>
	You have simply not awoken to what God or Love are.
</p>

<p>
	Emptiness is, ironically, just one facet of a much deeper thing which you have yet to access. You have not accessed it because self-inquiry is not a very effective tool to get there. And these various Buddhist and Neo-advaitan approaches which are popular today are fundamentally dogmatic and shallow. The realization of Emptiness and No-self is just the beginning of this work, which you have mistaken for the end.

<p>
	If you are not conscious that you are God and that you are imagining all of physical reality, your awakening is skin deep. And if you are not conscious that Truth and Love are identical, again, your awakening is skin deep.
</p>

<p>
	Everything I say here on this matter I have personally verified and become directly conscious of. And so have others before me.
</p>

<p>
	I have told you guys many times, you don't understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	If you do not want to follow my teachings to God and Love, then this is not the right place for you. This is not something I will compromise on. There is enough ignorance around here as it is to have to deal with supposedly awake people who deny God and Love. You can fool yourself, but you ain't foolin me.
</p>

<p>
	God's eye is watching you.
</p>

<p>
	You are being guided here to something far deeper than you yet understand. If you doubt that, by all means, do your own thing or follow some other teacher.

	That could happen. But the psychedelic helps to purify the mind, body, and heart. It's an incremental process of purification.

	Self-deception is always a danger, psychedelic or no.
