<p>
	It's good for you guys to see both the incredible bullshit of religion, and the incredible value of religion. That's the twisted paradox of it.
</p>

<p>
	Try to hold both views in your mind at the same time. It's good for stretching the mind.
</p>

<p>
	There is value in what Ralston and Sadhguru both have to say.

<p>
	With love, empathy, and compassion.
</p>

<p>
	Confront reality as it is. A big part of reality is that it can be ruthless and tragic. That's what makes it feel "real".
</p>

<p>
	Embrace the tragedy of it. That's part of its stark beauty.

	Go turn on the burner in your kitchen and try to stick your hand as close to it as you can.
</p>

<p>
	As you do that, ask yourself: What is the function of suffering?

<p>
	The trick is that if the mind imagines that something has meaning, then it does.
</p>

<p>
	So the irony is, people who deeply imagine Jesus can actually materialize Jesus. Of course the problem is that they then fool themselves into thinking that that's the only way.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine that Sanskrit is valuable, then it becomes so.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine that Sanskrit is just some sounds, then it becomes so.
</p>

<p>
	The key is becoming conscious of how you're imagining all this. What are you giving meaning to?
</p>

<p>
	For example, Ralston gives meaning to martial arts. But is martial arts any less silly than going to a shrine? What is martial arts really? It's the silliest thing in the world if you think about it. Two monkeys fighting each other to be top monkey. Why?
</p>

<p>
	Then again, why do anything? So long as you're alive you gotta occupy your time somehow.
</p>

<p>
	Evil doesn't exist!
</p>

<p>
	Evil if what "you" -- an ego self -- has labeled stuff which threatens your existence as an ego self.
</p>

<p>
	Fortunately the ego-self is not real, so it cannot really be harmed. Harm is illusory. But it sure feels real from your POV. That's the power of ego. Ego imagines evil. This is the cost of being born. You can't be born without dying.

<p>
	You are confusing your ego self with God.
</p>

<p>
	God proper has no needs or lack.
</p>

<p>
	Any need or lack you feel is simply the human ego self striving to survive. As a human you have real needs to stay alive. So go ahead and satisfy some of them. Just don't get too lost in a never-ending quest of satisying survival needs as that is a road to hell.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you should go make some friends.
</p>

<p>
	But God proper is above such things.
</p>

<p>
	Turning inwards and facing loneliness is a good spiritual practice, but it's an advanced practice for people who are ready for such things. It's not a solution to socialization problems.

<p>
	It would be rather selfish to hoard all that love for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Think about this very simply in human terms: if you just won the lottery for infinite dollars, what would you do? You'd give it all away to your family and loved ones. Why? Because it's fucking infinite! You've got nothing you lose!
</p>

<p>
	How petty would you have to be to not share it?
</p>

<p>
	What is the point of being an all-powerful God if you cannot share your Beauty and Goodness with everyone?
</p>

<p>
	Can you think of anything better for God to do? What would you do if you were God? Seriously. Think about it. What would you do?
</p>

<p>
	In the end you will come to this one conclusion: there is nothing else for God to do but share its infinite love. There can be no higher purpose. Any other purpose would not be worthy of God.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, God has no needs. What would you do if you had absolutely no need or lack? You'd radiate Love!
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	P.S. God IS bathing in Love for all of eternity. That bath is your experience. God loses nothing by creating you. You ARE God's Love!
</p>

<p>
	If you truly love yourself, why not touch yourself? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	Because I recognize that all symbols are relative and arbitrary. They make sense within a given system. They have as much meaning as you give them.
</p>

<p>
	God invents and understands all symbols. And its understanding goes even deeper than anything symbols can depict.

<p>
	If you like my symbols, cool, but also don't take them too seriously, in the same way that you don't want to get too attached to a single language.

<p>
	No amount of psychedelics can help so long as the person maintains the context of "it's all just wacky stuff happening in the brain." That materialist anchor must be challenged until it is realized that the brain was merely a conceptual fabrication.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it takes radical openmindedness to even take such a possibility seriously. It just does not occur to most people that their brain could be a hallucination. Let alone all of material reality, let alone their birth as a self.
</p>

<p>
	This is radical work we're doing here folks. The mindfuck of it is epic beyond description. It is twisted as fuck.

<p>
	There are many options.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering mindfully is a very direct path towards awakening, but it's hard to do precisely because it involves the thing you hate most: lots of suffering!
</p>

<p>
	Or you could do some other spiritual practice like meditation, yoga, psychedelics, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The following videos might help you:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		How To Deal With Strong Negative Emotions
	</li>
	<li>
		Awareness Alone Is Curative
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Psychedelics are a great way to learn about suffering.

</p>

<p>
	But see, you don't like that. You want to transcend suffering but stay an ego. That cannot happen. You have to completely surrender until you realize you were never born. At which point you become immortal.
</p>

<p>
	You die by realizing you were never born. That thing you think you are -- it's imaginary. Like Santa Claus. This must be directly realized. This realization is what we call awakening/enlightenment around here. It's like realizing that Santa Claus never existed. The only difference is that instead of Santa Claus, it's YOU!
</p>

<p>
	You cannot end suffering without awakening.
</p>

<p>
	This was the Buddha's great teaching.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you'll need to go even deeper than awakening. You'll need to also study and become deeply conscious of how survival dominates your entire life.

<p>
	To survive as a self! Suffering is the resistance of the self to dissolution.
</p>

<p>
	If you didn't suffer, you'd literally die and become God.
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>Suffering is the activity you invented to keep yourself from merging with God!</strong></u>

<title>Why do we suffer when we don’t really want to?</title>

<p>
	Suffering is survival.
</p>

<p>
	To stop suffering you'd have to transcend survival. But you don't know anything other than survival, so you're stuck.
</p>

<p>
	Even your desire to escape suffering is a form of survival, which of course just ends up creating more suffering.
</p>

<p>
	You are guys are not taking survival seriously enough as a topic. There is no more important topic to understand than survival.
</p>

<title>Reconciling Stage Green Productivity</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14265-clouffy/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14265" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14265-clouffy/" rel="">@clouffy</a> Green generally reduces the importance of productivity in favor of deepening relationships.
</p>

<p>
	This is not to say Green stops getting work done, but that macho desire to out-work all your competitors takes a back seat to building and enjoying relationships with human beings.
</p>

<p>
	So maybe rather than working overtime to publish 100 research papers, you devote more of your time to working one on one with your students and you become known as the most beloved professor by your students.
</p>

<p>
	Just an example.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, relationships can be powerful. Deep relationships can open many doors for you in life, so you may not have to work as hard.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, nothing wrong with work as long as it aligns with your values. Your work should be working towards embodying or spreading Green values. Then you'll be motivated. Instead of personal achievement and success, Green is more motivated to help people / environment.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I work a lot less than I used to when my center of gravity was Orange. Today I make a lot of time for chilling out, tripping, contemplation, and deepening my connection to God. This would be unthinkable to an Orange person. I still do work, but it happens more organically at a deeper level. There's less raw output, but more depth and enjoyment. I'm less neurotic about work. My sense of self is less identified with the quantity of work I do.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Hehe, that's a tough one. Academia is not generally open to that. Maybe you should reconsider being in academia. That's what I did. I have no desire to play their games.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, there certainly are ways to make it work.

</p>

<p>
	Of course Infinity includes both sentience and non-sentience, as that is a duality and a distinction which God imagines.
</p>

<p>
	God's plan is Love and Goodness. Awaken deeply to get the confirmation. Logic nor science will be sufficient. It is beyond communication or language.
</p>

<p>
	The confirmation of the most advanced things I teach is always: awakening. There cannot be any other way. You cannot use some dumb mechanical means to realize God's plan.

<p>
	Yes, prayer works, but you must be conscious that you are praying to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You also need to have a proper understanding of what "works" means in this context. Don't be praying for material stuff or the fulfillment of egoic needs. Pray for selflessness and unconditional love. Prayer for the end of your devilry.

<p>
	Of course you cannot just drop your POV. This takes decades of deconstructive work and numerous mystical experiences.

<p>
	In practice, less than 0.001% of the human population will ever discover the mind of God and cause of all Creation. Because they simply don't care enough to discover it.

<p>
	Horrible is a judgment you're making. Horror is a projection of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	All acts that happen in the universe happen out of Love. But you cannot see it because you are being too selfish.

<p>
	Amazingly numerical infinities have various sizes.
</p>

<p>
	Watch the video, Understanding Absolute Infinity - Part 2, where the work of Georg Cantor is explained.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity is not the same as a numerical infinity. Absolute Infinity doesn't have a size. It is simply reality itself.

<p>
	The universe is not indifferent.
</p>

<p>
	But also the universe has much bigger plans than merely keeping every being physically safe.
</p>

<p>
	The universe prioritzes freedom above physical safety.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're not understanding it is because you're trying to understand the selfless mind of God using your selfish mind. That cannot work. Your view of death and suffering is biased by the ego's hatred and fear of both. God doesn't hate, so this is not part of God's ultimate design.
</p>

<p>
	To understand God you must stop hating and fearing things.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There are stages to moral, cognitive, and spiritual development. These stages are consistent across people around the world.
</p>

<p>
	Absolutistic worldviews are lower than relativistic ones. With development, an absolutistic person will evolve into a relativistic one, but not vice versa. No amount to growth will turn a relativistic person into an absolutist, or a systems thinker into a black and white thinker.
</p>

<p>
	These are not just my opinions. This is scientific research from within developmental psychology. Study it, if you care to understand.

The conservative value set is lower consciousness. A conservative's sense of self is denser and fear greater. A conservative's cognitive and moral development are objectively lower and less truthful.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with false equivalencies and splitting all issues down the middle.
</p>

<p>
	The mid point between slavery and anti-slavery is still backwards.
</p>

<p>
	None of this makes liberals immune to ignorance or self-deception. But relative to conservatives they are 1 stage higher.
</p>

<p>
	Note: remember, these are relative evaluations, not absolute. Spiral Dynamics is a relative model. But politics is a relative matter so it fits.

<p>
	I notice you guys still have not penetrated (excuse the pun) the issue of survival as talked about in my 2 part survival series.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like using sex for pleasure is still survival! Survival is not just about making babies. Survival is about maintaining your self. The desire for intimacy, romance, and companionship is all survival.
</p>

<p>
	If a thing in life has any importance to you, you can be sure it's tied to your survival in some elaborate way.
</p>

<p>
	If a thing was irrelevant to your survival, you would not be talking about it, much less having a strong opinion about it.
</p>

<p>
	Opinions and emotions are survival.
</p>

<p>
	Realize this: one vs many it itself a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is one. Reality is many. It's both. There is no difference between the two. And there is a difference between the two. Depending on your POV.
</p>

<p>
	Is a dozen eggs one, or many?
</p>

<p>
	Notice the role of relativity in these kinds of questions.

<p>
	I am not stating my views. I am explaining how the culture holds sexuality.
</p>

<p>
	Of course my explanation is stage Blue/Orange because that's what our culture mostly is.
</p>

<p>
	If you wish to transcend this Blue/Orange stage we first need to be honest about it and understand it. Many people want to jump to stage Green love without fully understanding that sex & "love" are survival strategies. And then of course these same Green people end up having terrible relationships and much sex which ends in misery. That's because they fooled themselves into calling their selfish survival strategies "love".
</p>

<p>
	"love" is very tricky. The devil co-opts love so easily.

<p>
	It's not a matter of degrading or not. This is just how the sexual marketplace works for most humans. This is culture and survival.
</p>

<p>
	It does not have to be this way in the future. But today this is the cultural reality.
</p>

<p>
	When we talk about culture we are talking about averages and trends, so individual exceptions are expected. Just because you might not care about the cultural norms and values does not mean they don't exist.
</p>

<p>
	Most women want to settle down with a man who will be loyal to her. To deny this is silly. This desire to settle down with a man is a survival strategy.

	The shadow is simply all those aspects of the universe (self) which you have denied in order to maintain a limited human ego self. Yes, to fully embrace yourself as the whole universe you must now re-own those denied aspects of yourself. So that you may finally be complete. You must unify all the divisions your mind has created since your birth. For most people this is a difficult process because there is so much of the universe they have hated and demonized for so long. Now it must be admitted that all that hatred and demonetization was self-hatred and falsehood.

<p>
	See video: Understanding Absolute Infinity - Part 2 wherein is discussed Georg Cantor's set theory, which explains how multiple infinities work.
</p>

<p>
	There is an infinite number of different sizes of infinity. Which all adds up to one Absolute Infinity.

	Sure. Devilry tends to have many reasons, all of which boil down to survival and fear.

<title>Who's Interested In Conscious Politics?</title>

</p>

<p>
	I'm glad he's exploring Wilber's work, but Michael Brooks still doesn't understand the significance of Wilber's work and what Spiral Dynamics / developmental psychology means for politics.
</p>

<p>
	Michael is in high stage Green, but he's a bit too attached to Marxism, socialism, and the progressive movement to move into Tier 2. He's still operating at Tier 1 thinking. It's fine, but there's a higher level.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Michael makes valid critiques of the IDW and conservatives. But there are also important critiques of Marxism which he is missing. For example, one of the biggest critiques of Marx is his materialism. Materialism is false. Marx actually bastardized Hegel. Marx took Hegel's masterpiece philosophy -- which was idealist and quasi-nondual -- and lowered it by turning it materialistic and atheistic.
</p>

<p>
	A political philosophy based on materialism and atheism cannot possibly work in the long term. It will be fundamentally limited by misunderstanding the true metaphysics of reality.
</p>

<p>
	The whole trick with going to the highest levels of politics is being extremely careful not to get hung up on any pet ideology, whether Marxist, capitalist, or whatever. All ideology is limited and partial. Tier 2 politics is going beyond ideology.
</p>

<p>
	For Michael to move into Tier 2, he'd have to go through a painful process of dropping stage Green. This won't serve his immediate survival agenda as a political analyst.
</p>

<p>
	He's still a bit too intellectually arrogant to move into Tier 2. He'll need some mystical experiences to open him up and humble him.
</p>

			Can you explain this point?  Do you mean sex workers, rather than sluts. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	What's to explain?
</p>

<p>
	Everyone knows that women who have lots of casual sex are shamed and looked down upon as sluts.
</p>

<p>
	Why does this happen?
</p>

<p>
	Because the woman's value within society is directly related to her locking down a loyal man. If a woman is unable to do this, society thinks there's something wrong with her, like she's broken.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all of this is silly in the absolute sense. But in the relative world of survival it's a big deal. A woman cannot be seen as a slut because then no man will want to lock her down. Which hurts her survival ability. A woman's survival is significantly increased by locking down a responsible man.
</p>

<p>
	A woman who sleeps around a lot cannot be trusted by her man because he can't be sure if their kid is actually his. Women need to reassure men that their children are the man's children and no one else's. This is why men tend to be controlling of women. The man needs to be sure his wife isn't sleeping around behind his back because it can cost him enormously if she does so. In the past, such transgressions were punishable by death in many parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
	When a child is born, women go out of their way to say, "Oh look, he looks just like Daddy!" as as a subtle way of reassuring her man that "Look, this is really your kid, not someone else's."
</p>

<p>
	Sex and relationships are all a sneaky game of survival and manipulation. Automatically so. You're not at all conscious of how or why you're doing it. Rather, it's doing you. You are a marionette to sex.
</p>

<p>
	Society is the most evolved right now than it's ever been in the last 5000 years. The 21st century is a great time to be alive.
</p>

<p>
	Stop worrying, awakening yourself, and go about joyfully awakening society even further.

<p>
	The world needs your love, hope, vision, and passion.

<p>
	I've found psychedelics to be the best way. What he's bumping up against in his trips is the root of all fear. With dozens more trips the psychedelics should help him see through the illusory nature of all fear and break through to the other side of fear, which is Infinite Self-Love and Self-Acceptance -- Paradise!

<p>
	Great work. That's some quality tripping.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually, as you trip more, you should conquer that sense of going mad and after that it won't be a big deal. You will be able to go even deeper into the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	You are not pure enough yet and your self-understanding is not deep enough yet. You have too much fear which needs to be faced, processed, and put to rest.
</p>

<p>
	Facing madness and facing death are two of the biggest obstacles. But once you conquer those, that's when the tripping gets really profound and life-changing. You need to get as much of your personal crap out of the way as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's imagination happening, creating a relative sense of space.
</p>

<p>
	You are using the mind to compare thing A to thing B and then taking that difference as space. But where is that "space" located? Nowhere. Nowhere is infinite, so it is everywhere, giving the illusion of space. But there is no elsewhere but HERE and NOW. All places are NOW yet nowhere, thus allowing an infinite number of hidden dimensions to reality. Since everywhere is nowhere, all beings can be tucked away inside it, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
	There can literally be an infinite number of universes taking place right on top of each other, so to speak. Since they are all nowhere. That's the beauty of nowhere: it is unlimited.
</p>

	Yes, but one has to be conscious for that, and people aren't.

<p>
	The point is, all value is relative and imaginary. At this point a large part of her value, culturally, is reproductive. Don't forget, no babies, no human species. That's not changing anytime soon.
</p>

<p>
	All this discussion was simply to explain why sex is so moralized. Doesn't have to be in the future. But women still lose a lot of cultural value for being sluts. Relative value.

<p>
	You incarnate as all people. So in the end, you win and lose everything. You are reality experienced from every angle. One of those angles is your current angle. You can't have all possible angles without your particular angle.

<title>Non-dual Morality</title>

<p>
	To make a long story short: consciousness & love is the answer to all moral questions.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot fake consciousness or love. You act from your current level of consciousness, whatever that is. No amount of moralizing, theory, ideals, or ideology will change that. If you want to act better, raise your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The less self you have, the more loving you will be. If you want to be more moral, deconstruct your self until nothing of you remains.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot have a self and be moral at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	Nobody is gonna make sense of reality for you. That's your job. How about a few years of serious research, reading, careful contemplation, and basic meditative technique?
</p>

<p>
	You're barking up the biggest tree in the universe. So don't be surprised if it doesn't all make sense for the first decade. Having it all make sense is the end-result of decades of work.

<p>
	Space and time are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Right now you are nowhere. You've been in this nowhere for your whole life. You will be in this nowhere FOREVER! You cannot escape nowhere because there is nowhere else to go but nowhere, and you're already there. You've been nowhere FOREVER.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is becoming conscious of this fact.

<p>
	Practically, that is how human sexuality works. Since sexuality is a survival function its value is of course purely relative and imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Why is sex valuable to males and females? Ultimately for no reason whatsoever other than to advance the self. You don't go sticking your dick into tree holes because it does not advance your self. If it did, you'd do it and pay money for it. And tree holes would suddenly be worth a lot of money. There would be armed guards around every tree hole to ensure money is collected and the holes are not damaged (so more money could be collected in the future).
</p>

<p>
	Just observe how sex works. You'll see it's transactional. Sex is a transaction between two beings who have certain needs which they want met.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	By raising your consciousness high enough to realize that survival is an illusion and unimportant in the absolute sense. Survival is a relative matter. True morality is the transcendence of the need to survive. When you no longer care about whether you survive or not, then you have become truly moral. Otherwise you are a devil.

		<p>
			How did you build such a transversal mastery on that specific topic btw? I don't recall seeing much political content on your booklist? Who and what ressources influenced your analysis ? Are you pulling just most of them from your own personal insights or are you also standing here a bit on the shoulder of giants? Perhaps Ken Wilber has given you some nice tools?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is thanks to the power of holistic big picture thinking. It's precisely because I don't over-specialize in any one field that I am able to see a much bigger picture than most experts and professors. Specialization comes at the cost of wisdom and vision. I sacrifice technical accuracy for big picture understanding. Experts and professionals do the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	Politics cannot really be understood properly without a deep understanding of epistemology, ideology, cults, metaphysics, nondualty, spirituality, consciousness, philosophy, sociology, psychology, science, religion, language, ego, devilry, Spiral Dynamics, developmental psychology, relativism, and history.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than reading a lot of political theory, I spend a lot of time studying human beings, especially their collective behaviors. If you do that long enough without being ideological yourself, you will start to see how the whole game works. It's all about the mind clinging to various positions and refusing to acknowledge the bias and partiality of its own perspective. Without a deep understanding of epistemology there cannot be a deep understanding of politics.

<p>
	By that logic, why should you raise a family? Why should you start a work project? Why should you start a video game? Why should you drive to the grocery store? Why should you start having sex?

	Just as you're about to pull your dick out to have sex an airplane might crash through your roof and kill you.

<p>
	That's the trick with life, you cannot create a mechanical formula for what to do. You must use consciousness and wisdom to solve the puzzles.
</p>

<p>
	It would be foolish to try to eradicate all of anything. Life is far more subtle than that.
</p>

<p>
	Killing lots of stuff is usually not a very conscious solution.

<p>
	That is correct. Absolute Infinity cannot lack anything because it is total.
</p>

<p>
	Totality can only be singular. You can't have two totalities otherwise they weren't totalities to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could say that God is the totality of all sub-totalities.

	She is certainly ridiculed and dismissed for the most part.
</p>

<p>
	She will not resonate with stage Blue or Orange people.
</p>

<p>
	But also to be fair, I think she's not really cut out for being President. Presidency requires political experience. A person with zero government experience is going to be naive and make obvious mistakes no matter how well developed they are. Development and consciousness alone are not enough to make a great political leader.

<title>What's the deal with the moralization of sexuality?</title>

<p>
	Morality is a major survival function.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is a major survival function
</p>

<p>
	The two go hand in hand because sex is a very powerful force for humans. It dominates all of human life. This force is controlled and manipulated by the individual ego and the collective ego in order to maximize survival. Church and state both have a vested interest in regulating sex.
</p>

<p>
	Sex seems like fun and games, but sex is also a matter of life and death, especially for the woman. So she and her family must take it very seriously because her value in society is directly tied to her reproductive potential.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is worth a lot of money so egos will come up with all sorts of ways to manipulate it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, you can build entire empires with sex. People did and still do.
</p>

			We could be more intentional and actually more conscious people on board with helping. But maybe to change society as a whole we need to find more subtle ways to get under defense mechanisms. So, at least this stuff has a chance to enter someone's mind.

		<p>
			I've had thoughts in the past of making more conscious art and entertainment. This could be a subtle way to shift things. It could be deliberate but not "in your face".  With that, we can send loving conscious material across the airwaves. This is only one possibility.

<p>
	That's where spirituality intersects with life purpose. Your LP should be about helping mankind raise consciousness in whatever way you find more meaningful. That could be through film, social media, writing, music, art, business, politics, education, engineering, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing for now is to educate yourself further. A deep study should be made of Conscious Politics before you run off to start some political or social revolution.
</p>

<p>
	Once you do that AND you find your LP, then your whole life will be making an impact and helping to elevate people.

<p>
	Notice how Marianne Williamson is ridiculed as a hippie New Ager by the mainstream press and pundits.
</p>

<p>
	That's how people ahead of their time are treated by the mouth-breathing masses.
</p>

<p>
	She is certainly not electable today. And why is that? Because the level of consciousness of the majority of voters is too low to appreciate the level she is speaking from. So it will take a few hundred years of social evolution before her ideas become accepted as obvious and mainstream. In the meantime, over 10 million people will have to die for that lesson to be learned.
</p>

<p>
	And the biggest mindfuck of it all will be: once her ideas are accepted as totally obvious, no one in that future generation will believe that it could have been any other way. They will take it all for granted.

Then here's where the "darker" tone comes in. I remember at one point in the DPT trip it felt as if I was being possessed over and over again by different malevolent spirits telling me that I need to work on my sub communications towards people, because people can sense through my vocal tonality that there is no empathy there and that I need to have empathy in order for people to feel safe around me. I then just starting laughing like an evil maniac. I think for most normal people this type of thing would scare the shit out of them but honestly I was really enjoying getting possessed over and over again which I am not so sure if that's a good or bad thing lol. That was the the so called evil part of the trip

	I don't get that at all. Odd how different it is for people.
</p>

<p>
	I just get total nonduality and extreme visionary powers. I get the infinite vision of God. A vision powerful enough to spawn entire galaxies into existence.

			I remember near the end of the peak I placed my hands on him and attempted to heal him as he is a rescue dog and has been through a lot. I remember it felt as though I was taking on some of his "negative" karma and I shed a lot of tears as I was trying to heal him. He seemed to feel somewhat better, but I don't know if it's all in my head or just imagination or both. Like Leo says imagination is reality.

			If you’ve found a answer to a why that has answered and fulfilled you profoundly then I am happy for you and I hope you share your joy and let it guide you which you are doing. I genuinely feel there’s something behind your sharing, a love of sorts and it’s reaching people.  
		</p>

		<p>
			And to clarify I’m not saying there isn’t or I’m more right or correct in my words. This is just where I stand atm and could change.

	You're clearly an advanced practitioner. That is great. Which is why I am nudging you to go one step further. Do not stop until you have a direct consciousness of why Creation is happening.
</p>

<p>
	See my next blog video where I will explain it. But as you know, no explanation can do these things justice. You must discover it for yourselves. All I can do is tell you that I've done it and that it is possible and highly worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
	Keep questioning:
</p>

<p>
	Why life?
</p>

<p>
	Why life?
</p>

<p>
	Why life?
</p>

<p>
	What is the purpose?
</p>

<p>
	What is the point?
</p>

<p>
	Why is it like this?
</p>

<p>
	Why creation?
</p>

<p>
	Why is God doing this?
</p>

<p>
	What is God up to?
</p>

<p>
	Why life?
</p>

<p>
	Why form?
</p>

<p>
	Why humans?
</p>

<p>
	Why animals?
</p>

<p>
	Why evolution?
</p>

<p>
	Why all of this?
</p>

<p>
	What the fuck is it for?
</p>

<p>
	Why life?!!!!
</p>

<p>
	I must know! I will not stop until I know!
</p>

			Awesome video, just a note that might be helpful and seems contradictory with with what has been said in the video,
		</p>

		<p>
			from the book the Righteous mind by Jonathan Haidt, by comparison of data between questionnaires of leftists and rightwing voters,  he provides the results that Right wing people are more aware of the Left people's mindset and ideals, they just do not agree with them.
		</p>

		<p>
			However Left wing people, although considered more open minded fail to understand right wing and overestimate the conservatism of right wing, in their minds.
		</p>

		<p>
			That being said..... leftists are more solid in their opinions and fail to understand the Right wing to the core, when right wingers are far more aware but they strongly  disagree.
		</p>

<p>
	I don't find that to be true.
</p>

<p>
	1) Research shows that conservatives are consistently more closedminded than liberals. Conservatives are generally not interested in exploring other POVs. Liberals are more open to that and more tolerant of other perspectives. Of course not always so. Many liberals also become dogmatic. And many liberals especially hate conservatives and therefore misunderstand them.
</p>

<p>
	2) Spiral Dynamics research shows that conservatives are lower in their cognitive and moral development than liberals.
</p>

<p>
	I agree that we need more mutual understanding of all perspectives. Which is why I spend a lot of time studying conservative perspectives. But conservatives almost never do that. When was the last time you saw a conservative reading a book on Marxism or Feminism? It's laughable. They would never do that.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that conservatives merely disagree with socialism or post-modernism, for example. They fundamentally do not know what socialism or post-modernism is. Even highly educated conservatives like Jordan Peterson, who is a professor, do not have enough intellectual curiosity and objectivity to understand socialism or post-modernism. Liberalism correlates positively with higher education. Which is why conservatives like to ridicule and demonize universities and academia.
</p>

<p>
	I agree that most leftists do not understand the right wing to their core. But the right wing understands leftism even worse. Just go watch Fox News to see the proof.
