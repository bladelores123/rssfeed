</p>

<p>
	Maybe there is a deeper reason why you avoid truth. Maybe truth won't fit your fantasies of growth.

<p>
	But his base is not enough to win.
</p>

<p>
	The beauty of Trump is that his base cannot grow and he only knows how to rile them up. He doesn't know how to play moderate.

<p>
	It's interesting that when Steve Bannon was asked internally about Trump winning in 2020, he didn't even consider it a possibility.
</p>

<p>
	Internally they know Trump is fucked. His numbers are just terrible and he's not gonna be able to spin his way out of that the hole he's dug for himself. The media is not doing a good job of reporting on Trump's terrible record-low numbers. They keep acting as if Trump is a normal president with normal popular support. This is not the case. Trump is the most unpopular president of all time.

<title>New Girlfriend With Severe Depression</title>

<p>
	I've been in that exact situation before.
</p>

<p>
	It's gonna be really hard to make that work.
</p>

<p>
	Usually serious depression, anxiety, and low self esteem are a sign of some deeper trauma which she is avoiding/denying. Often it could be sexual abuse, rape, death of mother or father, etc. Serious stuff. This tends to go hand in hand with alcohol and substance abuse. So watch out.
</p>

<p>
	Such women get very needy, very clingy, very emotional, and they are almost impossible to help because they perceive suggestions to get help as an attack on their identity. As in, "Why don't you love me for who I am?!!!" A needy person is so desperate for love they cannot handle truth. The slightest suggestions for self-improvement trigger them. This creates a self-fulfilling prophecy effect where their fear of being abandoned makes them so clingy that no healthy relationship is possible, thereby leading to abandonment, reinforcing the idea in their mind that they are unlovable. No serious communication is possible because such people cannot handle truthful communication. They want fantasy and sweet lies.
</p>

<p>
	Such people need deep therapeutic help, enormous self-help work, and lots of spiritual development. Unfortunately they tend to refuse any such thing -- making their relationship impossible.
</p>

<p>
	And finally when you try to end the relationship, there will be huge waterworks and the threat of suicide.
</p>

<p>
	Try to see what you can do. Try introducing her to some basic self-help and self-esteem work. But also understand that this person has deep inner wounds which you probably cannot fix. Such wounds usually take 10-20 years to resolve, and that's IF the person is interested in working on herself.
</p>

<p>
	Try to figure out what the root cause of her depression / anxiety is. Usually it's a traumatic childhood or teenage event. She is likely to hide such an event from you because she's scared that if you find out you will leave her. Such women often lie a lot to themselves and therefore will lie to you. It's part of her coping strategy to avoid deep truth or deep self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
	In practice such women can only be in highly dysfunctional relationships until they do some serious self-help work.
</p>

<p>
	If she has serious low self-esteem, chances are high she's got a history of abusive relationships. Try to dig into her history to get a sense of what you're dealing with. It could be some dark stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Don't blame yourself. Some women are just like this and cannot be helped until they seek help for themselves.
</p>

<p>
	I know a sexual hypnosis technique where a girl can visualize and experience the orgasm of a man.
</p>

<p>
	You can orgasm without even physical stimulation.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is all about how you use your mind.

<p>
	After he won the Republican primary, I was worried he'd beat Hillary. He was just the type of guy average low-education Americans would vote for and we had 8 years of the Dems, so people would be looking for change.
</p>

<p>
	The difference now is that people are much more familiar with who Trump is. The only reason Trump won was because people did not know how much of a con artist he was. They bought into his fake image of a successful businessman while the media did a terrible job of explaining how much of fraud Trump was and disastrous his leadership would be. But now I think most voters understand the incompetency of Trump.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, Trump will always have a solid base of 40%. But that is not enough to win an election. The only way to win is to fool the 10% of swing voters. And he's not gonna be able to pull that off again. And the Dems and minorities now should be very energized, much more so than in 2016. The Dems were way too complacent in 2016. They didn't take Trump seriously enough.
</p>

<p>
	I foresee a continuation of the 2018 Blue Wave. 90%+ chance that Trump loses, but chances of winning the Senate are still bad.
</p>

<p>
	If it's Bernie vs Trump, I predict Bernie wins in a landslide.
</p>

<p>
	Warren vs Trump will be more problematic. But I still feel that basically any Dem will beat Trump in 2020.
</p>

<p>
	You awaken and realize that you are the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	This is why it's good to have an attitude of seeking Truth for truth's sake. Whatever the Truth turns out to be, you should already have resolved in your mind that you will accept it. Why? Simply because it's the Truth. Nothing else matters. That's the best attitude for this work. This makes things simple. You don't have to worry so much this way. You have faith that the Truth will solve all problems.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is like a compass you can rely on at all times.

<p>
	That's easy. God does not recognize evil because it doesn't judge itself.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to evil is to realize it is a projection of the ego-mind. Of course this is a not a solution your ego-mind likes.

<title>Differences: LSD vs psilocybine</title>

<p>
	Well, the most obvious difference is duration. LSD will last twice as long.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms are more twisted, more deranged, more organic & earthy.
</p>

<p>
	Both can be equally intense, depending on dosage. For me LSD has some unpleasant body load, more so than mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Walsh, this guy, is such a joke.
</p>

<p>
	The funniest thing is, all these people who denounce Trump as having bad moral character are still for all of his policies. The only thing they don't like about him is his nasty Tweeting. They dislike the way he makes conservatives look, but they like the ethnocentric stage Blue & hyper-capitalism Orange core.
</p>

<p>
	This is to fail to learn the lesson of Trump. Trump's surface nastiness is the least of the problem.

<p>
	Once Trump is out everyone who supported him will deny they ever really supported him. Even people in his admin will come up with a story about how they were only pretending to go along with him to help save a bad situation from catastrophe.
</p>

<p>
	There will be some epic denial going on in right-wing circles.
</p>

<p>
	There's already a lot of denial in the never-Trump right-wing circles where these never-Trumpers delude themselves into believing that Trump is not a true conservative and that he's some kind of anomaly of conservativism and doesn't represent the "real" conservative base.
</p>

<p>
	All this is ideology 101.
</p>

<p>
	And in 50 years, no one will understand how Trump was supported by anyone. The whole dynamic of ideology will be denied by the public mind.

<p>
	Do all the practices diligently and slowly you will transcend various personal needs.
</p>

<p>
	Or you can also exhaust them to death. Like, go have so much sex you get sick of it. Or go earn so much money that you stop caring about money.

<p>
	The very notion of "experience" is dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	Yet that does not mean that colors and sounds must cease to reach Truth or God.
</p>

<p>
	God is whatever is the case. So if you see red, that's God. If you see nothing at all, that too is God.
</p>

<p>
	People report total loss of sensation sometimes, but that's not necessary.

<p>
	Not ultimately true because God is omnipresent, since it is prior to space or position, which are relative things.
</p>

<p>
	If you become even more conscious you should notice that God is not located anywhere and that it is equally in all parts of your body. Your entire body is made out of God. Notice your hands especially next time.

<title>Love reflecting love analogy</title>

<p>
	It tends to work both ways. If you act in a loving manner at the 2nd order that helps move you to consciousness of the 1st order. And consciousness of the 1st order helps with acting more lovingly at the 2nd order.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why in all serious mystical schools they emphasize right action and compassion alongside meditation.
</p>

<p>
	But you can only go so far without consciousness of the 1st order. That is what most people are missing most. Compassion and action cannot ever substitute for lack of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	So the practical answer to your question is: become conscious of 1st order Love. Then you will know how to act. It's not possible to fake being unconditionally loving. It will only happen as a result of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	The same analogy can be used for relative vs absolute truth.
</p>

	You are never going to develop emotional maturity without facing your fear. That is what this whole thing called life is about.
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot face your fear of kissing a girl and her rejecting you -- that is much easier than transcending sexual craving and loneliness together, which requires awakening, which requires facing death.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is that you think you can avoid a small fear by facing a giant fear. But if you cannot face the small one how are you ever gonna face the gaint one?
</p>

<p>
	The solution here is to bite the bullet and go kiss some girls. It's not as bad as your mind paints it to be.

<title>Why does sight stop when eyes close and sound stop when ears covered?</title>

<p>
	Think of how an FPS video game works.
</p>

<p>
	There is actually no separation between the player and the world. The entire scene is rendered in one seamless frame. The player is enmeshed in the world.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, there really isn't a player. There is only the world, shaped in such a way that the illusion of a player is created (arms, feet, nose, blood, etc.). But all of that is really just part of the world.
</p>

<p>
	Your life is no different than an FPS game, with no one behind the screen.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with the internet is that it can be used for good or for devilry.
</p>

<p>
	The wild west days of the internet are over. Internet is far too powerful a technology not to be regulated.
</p>

<p>
	The internet could basically be exploited to create a new Nazi like movements and destabilize governments.
</p>

<p>
	Balancing freedom vs regulation is very tricky. People do not appreciate how tricky it is.

<p>
	Relative to an oil or banking executive Musk is doing great.
</p>

<p>
	We can't really expect him to be a guru. As a big business guy he's about as conscious as they get.
</p>

<p>
	But of course nowhere close to enlightened.

	Be probabaly just did some LSD.

<p>
	Teachings are more healthy when they don't demonize other stages, especially the higher stages which most peoole have yet to reach.
</p>

<p>
	So, for example, to be vocal about the dangers of stage Green right now is problematic because most people are still clinging to stage Blue and Orange. People need to be show the value and beauty of Green. People need to be lead to Green and beyond.
</p>

<p>
	Healthy teachings are those which lead folks to higher stages without demonizing other stages.

			I had multiple insights and experiences that every creation and every moment of this eternity is made from love for love, from me for me just expressed in different ways, but in the end I always feel like I want to run from myself. Like I'm dying instead of living. I know that all answers are within me, I ask God what I want to know and he provides me the answer the moment I finish my question. I have been working on transforming that fear to love for 3 or 4 years now, and I am in the place the same as when I started. I stopped meditating long time ago because it get too intense physical. I'm surrendering always to everything but the fear is so rooted in me. I can't express myself through conversation or any day to day experience.,.I can only feel alive when I take a high dose of shrooms or 4aco dmt when I die mentally, when I surrender to death. Those are the only times I feel love and peace with myself. If you have any advice for me, i would be thankful.

<p>
	More, deeper awakenings are required and some serious, industrial-grade spiritual practices like meditation/yoga/concentration.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will not rewire decades of bad mind habits. That requires daily practices over years.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional mastery is the hardest part of this work. It's much harder than a few awakenings and psychedelics alone will not be enough for that.

<title>Overwhelmed with Bliss</title>

<p>
	Observe yourself chasing positive states and notice how this subtle duality and attachment creates suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Expecting constant bliss precludes true peacefulness since when your bliss dips you start to complain, "Where did my bliss go? How can I get it back?" Which is the very root of unhappiness: trying to escape the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to chase bliss. Just observe this dynamic closely so that you become more and more aware that it cannot ultimately work. Through lots of observation of this clinging you will slowly aikido your clinging into surrender.

<p>
	If you have no memory of it, then that's the problem. You either did too much or you just weren't conscious enough to retain anything.
</p>

<p>
	This is one of the problems with smoking it. It's too fast, without giving you time to contemplate and understand what is actually happening to you. Contemplation is key here.
</p>

<p>
	This is why plugging it is much better for our work.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of psychedelics is to make sense of how your consciousness changes. Not just to have an experience but to UNDERSTAND why this experience is happening and what it is that is happening.
</p>

<p>
	Next time lower your doses and contemplate what reality is. You're looking for insight.

			Brother quick question, this confuses me huge times. I really love your insights and curiously follow them and use them to realize the same  it helped alot. But at some points I find it confusing. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Is this new insight not something that goes against all previous ones? 
		</p>

		<p>
			Ill list them here
		</p>

		<p>
			1.No free will/No control: We (humans) have no control whatsoever even if raising our finger or deciding to become lazy and lie on the couch forever (which I saw in your free will and live enlightenment video) that nothing is in the humans control. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Even Ramana Maharshi said everything even the finger raising is already predetermined, which brings to the second point. - >
		</p>

		<p>
			2.infinite intelligence: god is infinitely intelligent, comparing him to a game designer or a country in which neither the designer nor the goverment know what the citizens or the players will do because they are not infinitely intelligent and cannot foresee any unfolding, in contrast infinite intelligence knows everything and is everything so how can it be suprised by itself?  Wouldnt this mean that God needs to think and become sceptic in his decision and doesnt create instantly and superconsciously with infinite intelligence? 
		</p>

		<p>
			3. Twoness/Duality: saying that the government doesnt know what the citizens do, or the gamedesigner doesnt know how the players play. Or the legocreator that wont know what the child builds of it all imply one and other/twoness/separation. 
		</p>

		<p>
			However god and the humans are not separate so he should definitely know what will happen, if saying there is any kind of human independence creation isn't that just saying that there is one tiny little thing remaining that Is separate from God and not in gods control? 
		</p>

		<p>
			One more timeThank you <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="1" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/" rel="">@Leo Gura</a> for being available always I learned alot through your webpage.

<p>
	It ain't HPPD when you're in the middle of a high! LOL
</p>

<p>
	What happened was that you saw how your mind constructs/imagines reality. Yeah, you're in a hallucination at all times. The only question is how solid or loose is that hallucination. When you're sober your mind is very rigid and locked in. When you're high your mind is loose and free to imagine new physical realities.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing surprising about this.

You are assessing the existential reality of a thing based on monetary value. And yet it's obvious that money is purely a human imaginary construction.

<p>
	Many awakening experiences required.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a great deal.
</p>

<p>
	So does Kirya Yoga.
</p>

<p>
	You are going to think you way out of your body. This requires radical changes in your state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you do 100 psychedelic trips you will become much more detached from your body overall.

<p>
	Even advanced spiritual masters struggle with taming their sex drive. So for an average person it is basically impossible. You may as well stop shitting while you're at it.
</p>

<p>
	If you become a hardcore yogi, it is possible to transcend. But none of you here are at that level and I would never trust you to do it.
</p>

<p>
	You are better off being honest about your sexual cravings rather than trying to act all noble when deep down we both know you are a horny dog who cannot control itself in the slightest.
</p>

<p>
	If you were presented with an opportunity for sex you would pounce on it like a starving lion on a gazelle.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse lack of opportunity for some kind of spiritual transcendence. Just because you got no one to screw doesn't make you advanced. Actually it means you are even less advanced than you think. It makes you a starved devil.
</p>

<p>
	It is funny when a devil pretends to be above sex. You ain't fooling anyone but yourself.
</p>

Sounds like a typical trip. You doubt yourself too much.
</p>

<p>
	Drop your expectations for pleasantness or divinity. The trip gives you what you need. Integrate it and conintue tripping. Future trips will be different.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I find 4-AcO-DMT to be a huge mindfuck. Other psychedelics are easier.
</p>

<p>
	For me, the whole point of tripping is to contemplate and get answers. What answers do you want?
</p>

<p>
	It seems you're looking for a good time but you are not serious about understanding what reality is. When you get serious about understanding, how you feel will become irrelevant. This is why a passion for truth is so important in this work, otherwise you start chasing good feelings and you think something is wrong when you don't get good feeling. But notice, good feelings are a selfish motivation.
</p>

<p>
	You must get very clear about what you want out of this work.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Answering people's questions is often counter-productive because people are usually asking the wrong questions, and giving them answers does not actually help them become more conscious.
</p>

<p>
	A good guru goes meta and shows you the limitations of your questioning process. A good guru gets you to see that asking him for answers will not work. A good guru shows you how to find the answers from within.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that people's questions usually come from a place of survival, which only deepens their problem. A guru must show you how and why to go beyond survival.

<p>
	You have to be careful with such assumptions. These chemicals work differently on different people.
</p>

<p>
	Just because it works like this for me doesn't mean it will work this way for you or others.
</p>

<p>
	I can only report how it works for me. And in my experience, how such chemicals work on me is pretty unique. So you can't automatically extrapolate it to others. One's foundation, intentions, personality type, and genetics matter very much.
</p>

<p>
	Also, oracle implies that you are make predictions about things. I did not do that, nor would I consider that appropriate. It could be very dangerous to start playing the role of some oracle, getting people to believe you know the future, etc. Such powers are easily abused and could cause lots of harm.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between describing the nature of reality vs making predictions about the future. I would never make predictions about another person's life as this would interfere with their self-discovery process.
</p>

<p>
	It's also potentially quite dangerous to get it into your head that you speak for God. It's easy to corrupt God's messages and deceive yourself and others. I have to be very careful about it. And I don't really claim to speak for God. My claims are more modest: I understand what God is.

<title>Conspiracies do happen! And they have a massive influence on society</title>

<p>
	What you should notice about conspiracy theorists in general is that they have low quality minds and are emotionally immature.
</p>

<p>
	It's an attractive distraction from deep inner work.
</p>

<p>
	And the fact that once in a blue moon a conspiracy theory gets a bit of validation only makes conspiracy theorists all the more dangerous. If conspiracy theories were 100% false all the time, they would not be nearly as dangerous as when they are 90% false. The devil always needs to sprinkle in a few nuggets of truth into his teachings in order to get people bought in. A devil never sells you outright falsehood. The devil rarely outright lies. Because it's ineffective. The devil prefers to twist and pervert the truth. That's far more effective and malicious.
</p>

<p>
	The greatest delusions are built upon kernels of truth. There needs to be just enough truth so that the mind can rationalize away all the obvious falsehood.
</p>

<p>
	Alex Jones is a textbook example of this.
</p>

<p>
	You know what the greatest falsehood is today? Science!
</p>

<p>
	Precisely because it's so accurate at making predictions. Nobody suspects that the entirety of science could be a house of cards. Science is one of the devil's greatest works of deception.
</p>

<title>Gnosis: yellow religion?</title>

<p>
	I highly doubt it's Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Those are not diverse books. Looks like they are all part of the same incestuous family.
</p>

<p>
	I don't consider Gnositics to be that deeply woke. They are still playing at the shallow end of the nondual pool.

	It's no different than the way a country or a corporation works.
</p>

<p>
	A country is made out of its citizens. It controls and limits its citizens yet you are still free on any given day to decide what to eat, where to drive, and so forth. The limits are merely bounds to a sandbox. What you do in the sandbox is largely up to you.
</p>

<p>
	Or think of it this way: when you play with Legos, there are fundamental limits to what you can build given the shape of the blocks. But you still have enormous freedom to build lots of unique stuff which the designers of the blocks could not have envisioned.
</p>

<p>
	All limits work this way. Nothing is absolutely set in stone. Even if you're locked in a jail cell, you still have some freedom. You can still decide when to shit.

<p>
	No, that is to say that limits are finite. Knowledge is a limited thing, which you are failing to acknowledge. Knowledge is not unlimited because it must always take a certain form. Everything that takes on a form must become limited. This is simply a tautology. God cannot fully "know" itself because God is too infinite to be captured in a finite box (which is what knowledge is).
</p>

<p>
	So all we're saying is that God cannot put itself in a box. Or when it goes, it is no longer fully God, it is a part of God.

<p>
	Yes and no. The Godhead itself doesn't struggle with self-knowledge, but when it incarnates as a human, then there is the struggle to know itself.

<p>
	Yes, that's what a human is.

<p>
	You are thinking about this in far too limited a manner. You're using dualistic logic to try to figure this out, and that will never work.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a fixed story like a movie. It is an interactive story which is always in the process of being written, like a video game. The designers of a video game set very tight constraints, yet you as the player are still given a lot of freedom, so much so that even the designers cannot predict what you will do next.
</p>

<p>
	Even humans are capable enough of creating a video game which gives players agency, yet you think God is such a fool that all he could do was sit down and write out your entire life story?
</p>

<p>
	It's way more subtle and intelligent than that. Stop taking God for a moron.

</p>

<p>
	To understand the validity of a mathematical proof requires insight. Exactly the same kind of insight as enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you apply insight in the relative domain does not mean it is different in the absolute domain. Insight is a general function of consciousness. It can be used in all sorts of ways, from the mundane to the divine.
</p>

<p>
	You can have a valid insight into how to boil an egg. Of course that insight is relative to you being a human in a physical world where there exist eggs. If you enter some 5 dimensional astral realm, boiling eggs may no longer work.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Red & Blue spirituality is dogmatic and authoritarian.
</p>

<p>
	You need to seriously take into account historical context. The notion of being non-dogmatic did not even exist 1500 years ago in Arabia.
</p>

<p>
	And my guess is that Muhammad himself was not deeply enlightened. Rather he was good at channeling.
</p>

<p>
	And then of course you have to distinguish between Muhammad himself and his followers. Even if Muhammad was the shit, most of the people following him were dogmatic and they corrupted his teachings.
</p>

<p>
	It's not different than Christianity and all other religions.
</p>

Just so rich corporations could maximize their profits?

<p>
	The problem is one of doubt. Unless you have direct consciousness of God you will doubt it because it's too amazing to believe.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you did believe it, it wouldn't help much because it is not part of your living experience. It'd just a story some guy told you.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between being told about orgasm and actually having one.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is solved the moment you experience yourself as God. Awakening is the solution.

<p>
	Body is fine.
</p>

<p>
	Every trip actually heals my body and releases stored tensions and baggage. My body feels less substantial.
</p>

<p>
	With plugging there is no overload on the body. It feels healthy and good.

<p>
	You fear profile is gonna depend on an infinitely long chain of causation like your genetics, your personality type, the environment you were raised in, stuff that happened to you, thoughts you think, your goals and desires, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Remember fear is a survival mechanic. It was necessary to keep you alive as your limited human self. Fear is the cost of staying alive as a finite being. So in this sense it's hard to avoid. This is the whole challange of becoming infinite.

<p>
	Quantum and chemicals are forms within consciousness. You cannot ever get underneath consciousness because it is the only thing there is.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the TV screen. Everything else is content displayed on the screen. Don't confuse content for the screen itself.

<p>
	All things are connected by being ONE rather than two.

<p>
	Notice how your mind keep creating differences between things. That's duality. You keep dreaming up differences and getting lost in them.

<p>
	There is no difference between reality and illusion unless you imagine there is.

	There was no strain at all (except for the writing hand). It was comfortable and enjoyable.

	There is little ego backlash these days. It's no big deal at this point. As the mind becomes more pure there are less and less problems over all and the trips are always positive and healing.

<p>
	It wasn't really a voice, it was pure Infinite Intelligence expressing itself through me. It was totally direct. There was no sense of "other". I was simply speaking to myself, since there is in fact no other possibility. I was too conscious for there to be someone other than me in the room.
</p>

<p>
	It's really no different than solving a geometric proof. Who are you asking if the proof is true? You! The truth of the proof is seen by the intelligence of your own mind. So it's just like mathematics, but deeper.
</p>

<p>
	Do you talk to God when you do mathematics? Think about that. How do you know 5x5=25? By who's authority? Does a voice tell you it is true?
