<p>
	Working with emotions is very tricky stuff because they are not logical and they completely control one's behavior and thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	Bulling your way through emotional issues with a cold heart and lots of discipline will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional issues require a compassionate, gentle, loving, mindful approach.
</p>

<p>
	It's about becoming heart-centered rather than stuck in your head. It's about feeling into things, feeling into your body.
</p>

<p>
	The whole macho attitude of dominating emotional problems has to go.
</p>

<p>
	He is great to listen to, but just keep in mind that he doesn't understand spirituality,  nonduality, awakening, love, etc.
</p>

<p>
	He makes some excellent points about politics and ideology that are worth integrating.
</p>

<p>
	He's not really a communist in the way most people use that term. He likes to be provocative. By "communist" all he really means is a larger role for the state, and moving towards world government.
</p>

<p>
	You can agree or disagree with him on that, but his points about how ideology works are quite profound and important to understand. He makes important structural points there.

	Why are you spreading these toxic alt-right memes on this forum?

<p>
	Cucks?

<p>
	The alt-right is making a cuck out of you with their symbols which you are then spreading.

<p>
	Look, even psychoanalysis can be useful. It all depends on how you use it and what level you want to reach.
</p>

<p>
	I am speaking from the point of reaching absolute understanding of Self and reality. It won't take you there.
</p>

<p>
	Shadow work is useful but it ain't awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Have to be clear about your goals to select the right methods. Sometimes you need shadow work. Sometimes you need nonduality.

<p>
	You can find God through Jesus, but it will be a very limited path and you will probably not understand that Jesus is imaginary and that you are God imagining him.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of understanding what God is. The deepest levels are nondual and formless, so any kind of imagery like Jesus will get in the way. It's also crucial to understand that all spiritual imagery is relative. You could worship an elephant-man and it would work the same as Jesus. Because it's all imaginary. To get stuck on one set of imagery is so limiting.
</p>

<p>
	Not a belief, a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you were in a different state of consciousness you could become a kangaroo. But you aren't there. Changing states of consciousness is a real challenge because it defines "physical reality". It has to appear rock solid for reality to feel solid and not dreamlike.

</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you are looking. But there is no you.
</p>

<p>
	For awakening, that sense of you-ness must collapse. The mind will do every slippery thing possible to maintain the sense of you-ness. It's basically impossible to imagine what life would feel like without a you.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at the room, but while imagining you were never born. Notice the room is there without you.
</p>

<p>
	The sense of you is stuck to the room like toilet paper on a shoe, and it refuses to come off, since obviously that would be the end for you.
</p>

<title>Closing in Game</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44638-closing-in-game/?do=findComment&amp;comment=561576</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Closing involves a lot of factors and is an art in itself. This is perhaps the most advanced aspect of game on which hinge most of your results.
</p>

<p>
	Basically closing requires being really experienced at these things:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Screening her to make sure she's possible to isolate
	</li>
	<li>
		Being really good at planning logistics on the fly. Being really good at improvising new plans
	</li>
	<li>
		Leading -- getting her used to following you around
	</li>
	<li>
		Bouncing between various locations
	</li>
	<li>
		A convenient place to isolate her to (could be her place, or even a rented motel room, or even behind the elevator)
	</li>
	<li>
		Dealing with last minute resistance, shit-tests, and endless excuses
	</li>
	<li>
		Dealing with her annoying friends who will try to cockblock you every chance they get
	</li>
	<li>
		Seduction -- physically and emotionally turning her on.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	How do you learn all the above? Lots of trial and error, watching other experienced guys do it, and by studying some basic theory.
</p>

<p>
	Expect a lot of failure and near misses.
</p>

<p>
	One of the dirty secrets of PUA is that even the best guys only close like 50% of the women they manage to bring home. In the end, you can't force her. And many times she will be too relucant. But even to reach this point already takes serious skill. Just learning how to isolate her is tricky. There will be so many excuses and logistical obstacles. Endless excuses.
</p>

<p>
	Even once you get her panties off, it's still not a lock. You can lose her at any point. You can even lose her while you're inside her! It's a circus.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing will increase you lay count more than having a convenient place very near to where you met her. This is HUGE! It's so important it's worth paying an extra $1000/mo for it. Living within walking distance of the club/bar is priceless in game. If you have to drive 40 mins to your Mom's house, forget about it.
</p>

<p>
	That should be plainly obvious when you watch how conservatives defend Trump and war.
</p>

<p>
	They operate from an entirely different (and lower) level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who advocates for war gives himself away right away. That tells you who they are. A highly conscious being would never advocate for war.
</p>

<p>
	To be fair, plenty of centrist neoliberals also advocate for war. They are slightly more evolved, but not by much.
</p>

<p>
	Also the nationalism is a dead givaway of low consciousness. Nationalism is what gives rise to the racism, xenophobia, homophobia, mysogeny, culture wars, and fascistic/authoritarian leanings.
</p>

<p>
	Why do all the Republican Senators support Trump's brazen illegality and devilry? Because in their heart they like the notion of a strongman / authoritarian, as long as he is THEIR authoritarian. So they follow like sheep.
</p>

<p>
	Liberals are less inclined to behave this way. Liberals are less conformist, more free-thinking (even though they still of course get trapped in group-think).
</p>

<p>
	Studies show that liberals have higher openmindedness. Which is a key dimension of consciousness. You can't be conscious and closedminded at the same time.
</p>

And that is already happening.
</p>

<p>
	But it takes wealth and development to do that. In a world where many people are still starving, junk food is a step forward for them because it is cheap. They cannot afford better.
</p>

<p>
	Concerns about organic and whole food doesn't emerge until stage Green. 80% of the world isn't there yet.

	Psychedelics are a catalyst for facing one's shadow and transcending one's ego. The more dysfunctional one's ego is, the more shadow one has, the less stable one's mind is, the more things can go wrong during a trip.
</p>

<p>
	People with mental illness or disorders need psychedelics more than anyone, but they are also less likely to handle facing their shadow.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a high stakes bet for such people. If you win, you win big. If you lose, it will be hell.
</p>

<p>
	Proper and very gradual dosing is crucial in such cases. You don't want to bite off more than you can chew. The less mentally stable and whole that you are, the less you can chew, the less you should bite.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you are mentally unstable the less likely you are to follow my advice, the more sloppy your approach will be, the more likely you are to overdose and freak out. Ignorance cannot help being ignorant.
</p>

Your body is bald precisely because it adapted to wearing clothing.

If you are not addicted to sex, how do you know when to have sex?
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the solution to these issues. The more conscious you become the more wholesome your actions become overall, the more you act in alignment with wisdom and intelligence.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This just doesn't square with the facts.
</p>

<p>
	Humans have successfully adapted to cold environs for 100,000s of years. In fact, cold climates are more ideal for the growth of civilization, which is why the most developed countries are from the north, generally speaking.
</p>

<p>
	Eskimos are well adpated to living in Alaska and Nepalese have specially adapted lungs for living in the high altitudes. They can climb Mt Everest without oxygen tanks when most white people need to use oxygen tanks.
</p>

<p>
	And of course our skin colors have fully adapted to the climate we hail from.
</p>

<p>
	Evolution adapts fast. It's always adapting, even today.
</p>

<p>
	Humans and technology go hand in hand. These two cannot be treated seperately. Technology is a huge part of our evolution. We have adapted to cooked meat, fire, clothing, etc. long ago.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, we lived through the ice age and ate all the mammoths (probably). If you hail from Europe, eating mammoths is in your DNA.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's exactly the solution.
</p>

<p>
	Go be around people of various races and cultures until you stop seeing them as other or weird.
</p>

<p>
	Racism is very simple: it happens because people get stuck in a small circle of those who look like them and think like them. If everyone traveled around the world and interacted with people of all races and cultures, racism would disappear in a few generations.
</p>

<p>
	People deliberately segment themselves into like-minded enclaves in order to avoid expanding their sense of self and realizing their oneness with all beings.
</p>

<p>
	This is why people in major cities are less racist than those who live in the countryside. Because in a big city you are forced to interact with those who are different than you, but in the countryside you're living among your own kind, living in a racial/ethnic bubble.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, stopping wanting to cling to your own kind enough though that is what's more comfortable for your ego-mind.

<p>
	My point is not about politics. It's about the attachments you're exhibiting. You are missing the point of what I said to you, because you're stuck on matters of content.
</p>

<p>
	I let people know about pundits' fallacies in a non-attached way, conscious of the relativity of my perspective. That is the crucial difference. You are on here pushing an agenda every week. It's a question of attachment vs detachment for your own perspective.

Let it go. The way you comment is not in the spirit of our work here. Free your mind of that shit.
</p>

<p>
	All this political stuff you must hold very loosely, otherwise it turns into just another ideology. The content of your ideology is irrelevant, what matters is that your mind is stuck on it.
</p>

<p>
	Our work here is not to find better content to cling to, but to go meta and become conscious of the relativity of all content held. When you become conscious of this, you stop judging and blaming people.

	Lol, that is his fundamental mistake.
</p>

<p>
	He's running away from himself with his philosophical work. And it's obvious just by looking at his neurotic ticks when he speaks.
</p>

<p>
	This is the problem with academic philosophy. All brains, no consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is that there is no difference between inside and outside. But if Zizek would turn within, he'd discover God. Which is a problem for him, since he's an avowed atheist/materialist. So he keeps looking outside, forever lost in his own mind.

<p>
	It's not a physical blockage, it's an energetic blockage.
</p>

<p>
	How to deal with it I don't know. Reiki folks can do various healings on it but I don't know if that will be enough or not.

No explanation will work because all explanations are dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	So try all you want, but you will always fail. The only solution is to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why Zen masters do not answer your questions. Because all your questions are misguided attempts by the ego-mind to maintain its dualistic delusional reality.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to this problem exists on a new plane of consciousness from the one you're currently at. You will not be able to reason your way to that new plane.

	Oh God I love these libertarian videos:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcqPFR1DxCc?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Just goes to show how stuck the mind can get in stage Orange ideologies.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that a human can survive independent of society is a complete fiction. There has never been such a time in 300,000 years of human history. Less developed government means MORE dependence, not less. In tribal cultures humans are totally dependent on the tribe. No one is a lone libertarian wolf there.
</p>

<p>
	Even chimpanzees cannot survive on their own without a tribe.

<p>
	I'm a lone wolf type guy so I avoid these issues simply by keep to myself and following my life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	If someone is being an ass to you, leave their company. If it's a boss or coworker, then that's more challenging but that's basically turning into workplace harassment. You should be able to speak to HR about that and get them to stop. If it's a friend, change friends. If it's a family member, move away from your family or confront them about it. If it's happening at school, just ignore the person and stay away from them.

	No

<p>
	You are still making love too conditional because you are afraid of that unconditional love might hinder your survival.

<p>
	What is it that doesn't make sense?

<p>
	The princples behind the course are simple. But figuring out how to make your dreams a reality is a tricky and convoluted process because you have to deal with real-world obstacles like money.

<title>Fascism and its relation to Spiral Dynamics</title>

</p>

<p>
	There is a structural difference between the two. A stage Green person has no desire to be a fascist. They have outgrown that. They have a desire to support others who are different than them.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, sometimes a Green person might get upset or act foolish, but they will not create a fascist government.
</p>

<p>
	TYT is never going to lead to fascism, but Fox News could. Of course TYT can still be biased and lead to other lesser problems. CNN would also never lead to fascism because they are above that.

<p>
	Keep in mind that things have evolved a lot since Da Vinci's time.
</p>

<p>
	Today to succeed you must be more specialized. You can't be an architect, a painter, an engineer, and a writer because you will be out-competed by others who specialize in just one thing.
</p>

<p>
	Back in Da Vinci's time fields like engineering, architecture, etc. were not as developed or deep as they are today. It will take you 10 years of study just to become a decent engineer. And now you need work experience, licenses, certifications, etc.
</p>

<p>
	So you can certainly be a polymath in the casual sense of studying lots of topics, but you ain't gonna master them all enough to make a career out of. Pick your career field more carefully. Even something like Engineering is far too broad. You need to pick what kind of engineer you want to be.
</p>

<p>
	Competition is a lot more fierce today. So many amazing specialists to compete against. And it's a global marketplace. In Da Vinci's time the marketplace was a single city of 300,000 people, most of whom were peasants who couldn't read.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I would prefer to go vegetarian for ethical reasons if it didn't disrupt my life too much.
</p>

<p>
	Of course taste of the food is a factor. Meat probably tastes better to me. But that could be retrained.
</p>

<p>
	But for example, I don't like eating fruit all the time. It becomes too sugary and gross. I don't know how people pull that off for long periods of time even if it gives them enough energy. My body doesn't tolerate a fruit only diet.

<title>How to stop homosexuality?</title>

<p>
	It's not true acceptance if in the back of your mind you're accepting it only so that you can avoid facing it.
</p>

<p>
	"I accept that I have gay desires as long as that means I won't ever have any gay sex" << that's not acceptance!
</p>

<p>
	True acceptance would be: "It's okay if the only kind of sex I have in my life from now on is gay sex."
</p>

<p>
	Acceptance requires that you face the thing you don't want to face. Not hypothetically, but actually. That doesn't mean you actually have to have sex with a man, but you do have to face and accept the prospect of it until the point where it doesn't bother you.
</p>

			However it seems "impossible" with linear time thinking. In high levels of consciousness this type of time perception changes radically enough that you can see clearly what you said? Or is just an explanation/analogy what you are saying?

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yeah, what I'm saying is impossible to imagine from your current state of consciousness. You'd need a radical change of state.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, time and even cause & effect collapse in nonduality such that the impossible becomes possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can clearly recognize that you are the entire universe happening all at once. This is nondual awakening. No, it's not any analogy or explanation. You are the whole universe happening as we speak.
</p>

<p>
	Just as one example, I once became conscious that I wrote every book mankind has ever created. Not only did I write all the books in the universe, I am all of them too. The pages of every book is made out of my consciousness. And this goes for everything in the universe. I am everything that could ever possibly be. All of this is direct absolute truth. Not explanation or thinking or theory. It is not even perception. It is more true than perception and more true than mathematics.

			This mother/father stuff is the focus of psychology because child development is additive - new layers/functions are built on top of the old ones.<br />
			If child's needs aren't addressed by the parents, it will learn to satisfy them unconsciously by adopting coping mechanisms that will last a lifetime unless addressed. That is where the sex part comes in - these unconscious behaviors usually come bunched up with sex because it is an "adult" form of love.

<p>
	The ultimate truth is that male and female are both just aspects of your infinite self. You can have male and female orgasms. Both masculine and feminine energies are running through you and you will become most powerful once you integrate them both and experience life from both POVs.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine how powerful you would be if you were totally comfortable with your sexuality no matter what it was. That is true strength.
</p>

<p>
	To worry or fear about being gay is weakness.
</p>

<p>
	This is why Self-Love is the ultimate strength. It requires total fearlessness. So this is great opportunity for you to train yourself to be strong. A strong man is able to have sex with another man. A weak man is not. Your culture has this all backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Dude, look at the silliness of your position.
</p>

<p>
	If you desire to be fucked, that's YOUR DESIRE, YOUR WANT. The problem is that you are denying your own wants. The solution is to accept your own wants. It is your right to deny your own wants or embrace them.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I came to you and said I want to eat ice cream. But I don't want ice cream. I hate ice cream. Don't I have a right to hate ice cream? I'm so unlucky to want ice cream.
</p>

<p>
	You would call me insane.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is simply that your culture has brainwashed you to believe that men aren't supposed to enjoy getting fucked. But all that is, is cultural brainwashing. You must question your own cultural norms and assumptions until you realize that they are completely arbitrary, groundless, and even dysfunctional, as in this case. Your culture tells you that men shouldn't enjoy getting fucked, yet the truth is that many men in your culture enjoy it. So what is the point of following a culture which is so clearly untruthful? You'd have to be crazy to buy into such a culture. Then again, you were brainwashed into it from birth, so it feels like it shouldn't be questioned.

	You are all bodies, all beings, all things.
</p>

<p>
	If you woke up as a kangaroo tomorrow, you'd still be asking, "Why this kangaroo? Why not something else?" And so it would go until you went through every being and ended up right where you are right now. Someone has to be in your shoes. So here you are! Actually, no one is in your shoes. No one is in everyone's shoes, looking through everyone's eyes.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, since you are the only being in existence, you have to be in all places at once. So you are in this place right now. Every place is as important as any other.

<p>
	Yeah, it really depends a lot on the culture. It won't fly so well in under-developed countries with traditional cultures like the Middle East.
</p>

<p>
	If your friends are stage Orange/Green or Green, it should be okay. But low Orange and below will be a problem. Blue will be a big problem.
</p>

<p>
	Homosexuals basically don't exist in Blue cultures. Because they are demonized and even killed if they come forward. Blue forces a repression of homosexuality. It's a total denial.

<p>
	I'm no expert on it, but the whole theme of interpreting human actions as a desire for sex, sexual organs, hidden perverted sexual desires, and all the mother/father stuff is just way too overblown.
</p>

<p>
	A being's actions are not primarily about sex, they are about self-survival. Sex is a tiny part of that. Psychoanalysis doesn't understand this and of course it doesn't understand spirituality, self-transcendence, nonduality, epistemology, or metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	Freud projected his own sexual perversions onto the world and saw in the world a reflection of his own neurotic shadow self. But just because Freud was that way doesn't mean we all are that way. In fact most of us are not.
</p>

<p>
	I don't find Freud's theories useful for personal development or self-transcendence. There are much better frameworks. Most self-help frameworks are better. Go grab any random book in the self-help isle of the bookstore and you will get better and more useful advice for improving your life than by reading Freud. Any book on my book list will be far better.
</p>

<title>Overcoming stage green ego</title>

<p>
	I agree we need to distinguish between progressives and neoliberals/centrists.
</p>

<p>
	But how it's done is also important. It's important to recognize that lots of people are neoliberals and centrist liberals because that is their level of development. You can't brow-beat them into becoming progressives. Almost by definition progressives are the rarest ones on the political spectrum.
</p>

<p>
	So while it's important to not confuse a neoliberal for a progressive, attacking neoliberals and centrist Dems is problematic because you just can't convert all Dems into progressives. There needs to be coalition and some mutual acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	My problem with Jimmy Dore is that I feel he's too aggressive. It's like red meat for progressives but it won't work to build a coalition. Being a rabid dog is not a good way to go. Bernie is very progressive but he's not so rabid and obnoxious about it, which allows him to attract people who normally wouldn't call themselves progressives or socialists or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	A very important principle for you to learn is that of meeting people where they're at. This will come up for you over and over again in life if you're going to be an advanced human. A lot of people will not be as advanced as you, and your solution to that cannot be to obnoxiously attack or "otherize" them.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that these are all your brothers and sisters. That is the real challenge. It would be so much easier if we could otherize half the population and lock them up in Montana. But we can't.
</p>

<p>
	Unconditional Love definitely has a feeling to it, too.
</p>

<p>
	You're simply missing a mystical experience of Love. Try contemplating what love is on a psychedelic. You're disconnected from Being, and thinking about love in the abstract is not going to be enough to reconnect you. You need a direct experience to jolt you awake.
</p>

<p>
	You might also want to optimize your brain health, mental health, nutrition, energy, etc. to make sure that some chemical imbalance or energetic block is not obstructing you. Get blood work done. Check for vitamin deficiencies, heavy metal toxicity, etc. Dial in your health because it is the foundation for everything else.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you have too much lead or mercury in your brain, you may not be able to feel love the way you otherwise could.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't feel anything, that shows me some deeper underlying chemical or health issue. Or possibly some energetic blockage. That is not normal. Start researching your symptoms.
</p>

	That was your comfortable ego-world of self-constructed meanings being revealed to be relative, biased, and imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da! You constructed "reality" to suit your survival.

<p>
	It's like you've were born a rich kid and lived in a gated community your whole life and then one day you accidentally venture outside the gate and see poor people living in misery, toiling to put food on your banquet table.

	Calling something an illusion doesn't give you mastery over it or even an understanding of how it works.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea how your computer works. And your computer is an illusion. That doesn't make you qualified to talk about computer engineering.

<title>sedona method / organization - and letting go</title>

<p>
	If you're practicing Sedona Method, you gotta let go 100s and 1000s of times.
</p>

<p>
	You don't just let go once and you're done. It's more like meditation, where you get go of one thought, but then it comes back and you keep letting it go 1000 times.
</p>

<title>Self-love video applied to quitting an addiction</title>

<p>
	That's not the issue.
</p>

<p>
	The point is: feel love for yourself either way.
</p>

<p>
	Don't THINK about love but actually FEEL love for yourself and your addictive situation. The way a loving mother might if you told her you're addicted to weed. That doesn't mean she wants you doing more weed. But she would lovingly empathize for the challenging situation you find yourself in. Do that, but to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Separate the love from your plans to fix the problem. Love first, fix later. As guys we tend to skip immediately to the fixing phase, skipping the love and acceptance phase.
</p>

<p>
	And if you slip and do more weed even though you intended to stop. Love yourself for that failure too.
</p>

	Red Pill is a toxic, garbage ideology. No more Red Pill on this forum. I expect you guys to be above such things.
</p>

<p>
	Watch my videos about the problems with ideology, survival, and self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	To free your mind you must avoid all self-biased ideologies.

<p>
	This is silly.
</p>

<p>
	There is still a big excess of masculine energy in government and positions of power. We are nowhere near a healthy balanced point.
</p>

<p>
	Again, this is a conflation of stage Green with stage Red. The worry that stage Green will become fascistic is totally overblown. The bigger worry is actual stage Red & Blue fascism -- which is still a real force around the world.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be wise enough to pick the right things to worry about. Worrying about excess Green is like worrying about the women's bathroom on the Titanic while it is sinking. Your worry is misdirected.

<p>
	1) It's an excellent teaching
</p>

<p>
	2) If you still have no clue how to let go, you haven't really been listening. The teaching is super, super simple.
</p>

<p>
	There is no method for letting go. You just let go. That is the method. Simple. But it requires practice. Stop looking for intellectual explanations. Just do it.

<title>Too many practices</title>

<p>
	You can cycle practices throughout the year, to keep things fresh and yet not overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
	The point of trying lots of practices is to find those small handful which you will commit to. And also to have ones in the back pocket for when your life takes a turn in the future and you are in need of some specific one. These practices will be useful throughout the rest of your time at different points.

<p>
	I think what everyone overlooks is the simple fact that people have different nutritional needs. There is no one best diet in the abstract. The question is always: What is the best diet <u>FOR ME</u>? And that you can only discover through trial and error.
</p>

<p>
	There are many factors at play: your genetics, geography, climate, your budget, your health conditions, your level of development, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I have found that vegetarian does not work well for me. It doesn't give me the energy that I need to function well. But it would be a mistake to apply my conclusion to all other people. My conclusion is for me.

<title>Is a world Government even possible?</title>

<p>
	Obviously systems would need to be put in place such that there is no chance of a tyrant controlling the world government. There needs to be robust system of checks and balances and a robust impeachment process for any high level leaders. There need to be independent ethics boards with power to investigate and also to remove corrupt leaders.
</p>

<p>
	Basically we need a World Constitutional Convention as we had in America back at its founding where all the countries agree on a set of rules and norms for how the world government will function, with a set of checks and balances to make sure it is protected against devirly and manipulation.
</p>

<p>
	All of this will happen, but probably not in our lifetimes. Citizens aren't developed enough yet to see the wisdom in such a system. People are too xenophobic, prideful, and nationalistic still. A world government can only work when a large amount of citizens have a global identity. People would have to stop seeing themselves as Chinese, Hindu, Jew, American, Japanese, German, Christian, Muslim, etc. and just see themselves humans.
</p>
