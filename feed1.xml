<p>
	That's doable. Although San Diego is a pretty reasonable drive from LA.

<p>
	Why do you have no problem with source needing you to spend thousands of $$$ to feed it self?
</p>

<p>
	By your logic shouldn't God hand out free slices of pizza to homeless people? And while we're at it why not a free Rolls Royce too? After all, source wouldn't want people to have to get places using their legs. That might produce blisters. And everyone knows driving a Kia is just embarrassing.

	Shakipat is a classic awakening method. But it's not gonna work on everyone and like all methods it has its pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you can shortcut the hard work of inner development, you'll probably be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that awakening ain't development, and development ain't awakening.

I understand that you may not want to rely on random forum people, but very least, I could help come up with and organize a suitable venue, if it ever comes to the European tour and you consider my city :).

<p>
	Maybe, we'll have to see. The trick with doing these tours is that things have to be reliable and timely. It can't be like, "I was gonna help you but then my cat died."

<p>
	What you presently are, is already God. You just need to realize that this is so. That is enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment will be the death of "you". After that, there is nothing left to die.

</p>

<p>
	The ticket price makes up only a portion of the total of the travel expenses. And for this tour, the tickets have to be at specific hours. Budget red-eye flights with long layovers will not work. I can't arrive dead tired. I have to be fresh enough to speak and lead a group.

</p>

<p>
	What you're looking for is nonduality. Or maybe some kind of meditative yoga center. Not Hatha yoga but serious Indian meditative yoga like Kundalini yoga, Kriya yoga, etc.
</p>

<p>
	In Vegas we have a pretty good Indian yoga center. But that will vary a lot city to city.
</p>

<p>
	Usually you have to travel to find good nondual teachers. Isn't Rupert Spira in the UK? That might be your best bet. I've traveled to far away places to seek out the best teachers. It is worth it.
</p>

<p>
	In the old days folks would fly to India.
</p>

<p>
	Also Sadhguru has yoga initiations in London I'm sure. Maybe even Ireland.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a good question. I imagine my talks will be in the vein of Actualized.org videos. With some new helpful in-person group exercises which would be focused on raising general consciousness & self awareness. This would be useful for all people across the board, basically delving you into consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	I don't think we'd directly work on life purpose, but consciousness work will help with all your goals, from career to relationships to spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	We would probably be exploring topics like emotional mastery, fear, judgment, confidence, self-esteem, self-deception, spirituality, meditation techniques, body awareness, nonduality, shadow work, motivation, getting unstuck, etc.

<p>
	The dates will be set and announced long ahead of time so that people can be mobilized to sign up.
</p>

<p>
	You would have to sign up online and submit payment ($30) to reserve your spot. Otherwise many people will flake. And also because I need to know how big of a meeting room to book. Every room has a max occupancy which is commonly 15, 20, 30, or 40 people.
</p>

<p>
	If I'm flying out there, you gotta show up. It costs at least $500-$700 to fly out to even nearby cities.

<p>
	You cannot invalidate Truth. That's the trick!
</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Nothing the materialist can do will undermined nonduality. In fact, the entire universe could explode tomorrow and nonduality would still hold.
</p>

<p>
	That's the value of nonduality. It's FOREVER! If it could be undermined by some silly materialist's scientific discovery it wouldn't be worth talking about.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot apply relativistic standards of falsification to the Absolute!
</p>

<p>
	You can discover the Absolute for yourself. But you cannot ever falsify it. Because it is true, absolutely.

<p>
	So I've decided to give this tour a shot. The details are still yet to be determined but tentatively I'm hoping to visit about 10 cities in the next year around the US.
</p>

<p>
	This tour would happen in 3 phases:
</p>

<p>
	Phase #1: Los Angeles, San Fran, Seattle<br />
	Phase #2: Phoenix, Dallas, Chicago, NY<br />
	Phase #3: Austin, Atlanta, Miami
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps not in exactly that order, but something akin to that. We will adjust cities based on demand. But Phase #1 seems fairly certain to happen in that order.
</p>

<p>
	It would work as follows:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I would fly into the city on Friday
	</li>
	<li>
		Around 6-7pm on Friday we would meet in a hotel conference room where I would give a talk on some new topic followed by some group exercises and Q&A.
	</li>
	<li>
		This would all last about 2-3 hrs long in total, with about 10-30 people attending (depending on demand).
	</li>
	<li>
		This would perhaps be followed by a dinner at a local eatery, depending on crowd size. Probably limited to 10 people max as it gets unwieldy with a party over 10.
	</li>
	<li>
		Cost: estimated around $30/person
	</li>
	<li>
		Cost of attending dinner: some amount just to keep the group to 10 max + you pay for your dinner
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I would visit at least 1 city per month, maybe as much as 1 city every 2 weeks. The schedule would vary to avoid conflict with holidays but the meetings would be held on Friday evenings.
</p>

<p>
	Locations outside USA are too cost and time prohibitive right now. Europe might be possible if and when Phase #3 is successfully completed, but that's too early to talk about yet.
</p>

<p>
	I'm doing this in phases because I have no idea yet how many people would show up in which cities. If fewer than 10, it's not really worth doing due to the expenses of travel, hotel, meeting room, car, and time. 10-30 would be ideal for now. More than 30 requires larger, more expensive meeting rooms but I doubt we'll have this problem at this stage.
</p>

<p>
	If there is interest I might also design a one-day mini-workshop which I would teach on the following day: Saturday. With the idea being that if you like the Friday talk and you want to do a more in-depth training the following day, that might cost $100-$200 for let's say a 4-hour training. This extra mini-workshop day would help cover my costs of travel and it would be a good learning experience for you. But for the mini-workshop to be practical there would have to be at least 5 people paying. Otherwise it's not worth the hassle.
</p>

<p>
	The trick in planning this out is that I have no idea how many people would be interested in this in each of the above cities, let alone show up. The only way to find out is to actually schedule the dates and do it. So I will probably be making concrete plans shortly for Los Angeles, San Fran, & Seattle. After those 3 are complete we could assess how things went, make improvements, and schedule new cities. Or, if not enough people show up, then Phase #1 will be the end of this experiment.
</p>

<p>
	Let me know what ya'll think.
</p>

<p>
	This would probably only work if those who want to attend can convince 1 or 2 friends to come as well.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest benefits of these meet ups would be the ability to network and make friends with self-actualizers in your city. So you don't just get to meet me, but you get to make some new local friends who are into this work who you can hang out with for years to come.
</p>

<p>
	I'm excited to do some talking and socializing in the non-digital realm <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

			Does Leo take all of the nootropics mentioned in his video simultaneously? Like at any one time, how many nootropics is it appropriate to be on? Are there any long term benefits to modafanil/armodafanil? Or are these two drugs only good for the period of time that you are on them?Â

<p>
	It's certainly possible to take 20 pills at once. I don't do that every day but some days I do. Depends on what I'm planning to do and what I'm in the mood for. Most days I take a smaller batch of like 6-10 essential pills. As you experiment you will discover which ones are most essential for you.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if I'm going to be doing a long day of creative intellectual work I might take the full 20 pill stack. But for most days that's overkill. I'm not gonna take that on a weekend when I'm just chilling.

This you will do for years. And at the same time you want to have 2-4 things you are working on in your life using the various techniques and practices we talk about.
</p>

<p>
	Like meditation, contemplation, psychedelics, journaling, working on your career, working on your diet, visualization, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Start with those things which are giving you the most problem, which are keeping you stuck the most.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to do everything at once. Come up with a list of your priorities. Something like: #1 career, #2 diet, #3 relationships, or whatever. It's hard to do personal dev in the abstract. You need to have some concrete goals that you're working towards, whether it's getting a girlfriend or starting a profitable biz or having your first mystical experience. Those are all concrete goals you can work towards every day using various practices.
</p>

<p>
	What are the top 3 ways in which you want to change your life? Start there.

<p>
	Yellow is about exploring lots of different POVs.

<p>
	Don't expect any Yellow news sources. Too early in our evolution for that. It doesn't sell and it cannot become mainstream or popular yet.

<title>Spiral Dynamics (Worldview) Questionnaire Test</title>

<p>
	If you were at stage Blue or Orange, for example, you would not pick higher stage values because you know they are "right" because the whole point of being at a stage is that you think that stage is right.
</p>

<p>
	A Blue person will resonate with traditional values no matter how much you tell him that dogma, conformity, ideology, and ethnocentrism are not "right". That's what it means to be at Blue.
</p>

<p>
	And likewise for the other stages.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really fake your stage. Whatever you resonate with or gravitate towards genuinely is what defines your stage. If you genuinely gravitate towards integrating many perspectives from across the world then that by definition makes you as least Greenish, if not Yellowish.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you probably still have lots of work to do to fully exhaust and transcend Orange. There is a big difference between dabbling in a stage vs fully mastering and realizing a stage's limitations. A lot of people can dabble in Green & Yellow without having fully exhausted Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever stage you are at, you also have 25% of the stage below it, and 25% of the stage above it.
</p>

<p>
	So if you feel you are Orange, you probably have 25% Blue and 25% Green. That's what being Orange really means. It does not mean you are 100% Orange but only 50% Orange. Likewise, the typical Green person has 25% Orange and 25% Yellow. And so on. Almost no body is solidly one color. Don't expect people or collectives to be 100% anything.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The more you do the work more no-mind you will experience. At first it will be only seconds at a time, but with more practice it will turn into minutes, and then hours.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is very good for attaining no-mind. It will speed up your progess a lot.
</p>

<p>
	You can also specifically train mindfulness during busy work. Start by doing walking meditation. The try to meditate while driving, while doing the dishes, while out in public, and even inside of conversations. All of this will take a few years at least.
</p>

<p>
	Attaining stable no-mind is not easy at all. It is a very advanced stage of practice and I am certaibly not there after 5 years of meditation and other kinds of work.
</p>

<p>
	But I am getting closer. Just lately I made a significant step towards no-mind and I can see that it will come with years more of practice.
</p>

<p>
	It'sÂ worth the work.
</p>

<p>
	1) It is especially important to emphasize that identity is relative because people generally believe identity is a physical fact. Like, a cat is a cat. No, a cat is a cat only TO YOU. The universe at large draws no such distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	And very importantly that means that your identity as a human being is relative. It is not absolutely true.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, if you truly understood that everything is relative you would also understand that identity is relative, but it helps to emphasize the point.
</p>

<p>
	2) All Actualized.org videos are basically about dialing in your inner game.

<p>
	Masculine compassion is not about using mean language. It is about enforcing necessary boundaries and facing harsh truths.
</p>

<p>
	Being mean is just being an egoic dick.
</p>

<p>
	Congratz on your ceremony.

<p>
	There is a big difference between the rate at which people who follow Actualized.org grow and the general population.
</p>

<p>
	If you watch me and you do many of the techniques I talk about you will grow by a stage every 2 years or so. But his Orange friends aren't doing that. They don't even know about Spiral Dynamics and they don't care about what Actualized.org teaches.
</p>

<p>
	Just to be interested in Actualized.org you must already be a pretty rare type of person.

<p>
	5-MeO basically has no tolerance so you could do back to back doses.
</p>

<p>
	The real issue is whether you'd actually want to redose.
</p>

<p>
	10mg is a good starting dose for snorting/plugging.
</p>

<p>
	5mg is too little unless you are smoking it.
</p>

<p>
	10mg snorted willÂ freak you out enough that you probably won't want to redose that day. Even 10mg if its your first time can be very shocking.
</p>

<p>
	For me 5-MeO trips tend to be so deep that I would never want to redose same day.
</p>

<p>
	I would plan it like this:
</p>

<p>
	Day 1: 10-12mg
</p>

<p>
	Day 2: 15-20mg
</p>

<p>
	Day 3: 25mg
</p>

<p>
	A week later: 30mg
</p>

<p>
	Even that will be emotionally challenging to pull off.
</p>

<p>
	After my 30mg dose I didn't want to do 5-MeO for a whole year. That's how strong it is. I still have no desire to do a 30mg dose.
</p>

<p>
	At 30mg your life as a human being is over.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Have you been working too hard? Sounds like you might need to slow things down and take more time for yourself, for fun. When doing highly creative work you need some outlets for breaks and diversion to recharge your batteries.
</p>

<p>
	Like take a small vacation every 90 days.

<p>
	Try making at least one new friend who is beyond stage Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Then compare and see if you want more of that.
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty important to make at least one Yellow/Turquoise friend.
</p>

<p>
	You won't really be able to drag an Orange person higher. They have to evolve into it on their own, and I wouldn't count on it happening for at least 10 years. And even then, Green is not that advanced.

<p>
	There is value in talking about it so as to point out all the traps, explain the techniques, clear up egoic confusion, and inspire/motivate people into action.
</p>

<p>
	But philosophizing,Â speculating, or debatingÂ about nonduality is counter-productive.

<p>
	Predetermined vs not predetermined is just another duality.
</p>

<p>
	All of that collapses in the end. It is mystical.
</p>

<p>
	Since you are God, every action you take is basically an act of God. Whatever you end up doing is God's unfoldment -- what God is. And God is EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really make sense to ask "Who did X?" because there is only one thing in existence ultimately: YOU/Consciousness/God/Reality

	$2k-$3k range is great. You don't need anything more expensive.

<p>
	Hard to say if LSD will resolve your headaches, but it will certainly result in spiritual purification. LSD is an awesome substance. Dare I say, better than mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try Shamanic Breathing as described in my video. That's a very powerful therapeutic technique.
</p>

<p>
	Don't trip on LSD or mushrooms more than once very 2 weeks. Otherwise tolerance. Plus you want to fully integrate your trips which usually requires at least a week or two. If you trip too often without enough integration you will likely start to experience some bad trips which will scare you away from psychedelics forever.
</p>

<p>
	The best strategy is to trip gradually but consistently over long periods of time. The trips will build on themselves and you will keep growing and growing in depth.
</p>

<title>Greek Gods &amp; Nonduality?</title>

<p>
	You can basically think of the Greek gods as the Hindu gods.
</p>

<p>
	Shiva = Zeus = God
</p>

<p>
	That's the big nondual daddy. The godhead.
</p>

<p>
	And then you got all kinds of other lesser gods.
</p>

<p>
	There's really no contradiction.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics actually also parallel this structure.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO = Zeus
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms, AL-LAD, DMT, etc. are the lesser gods.
</p>

<p>
	There is a much more fundamental problem here: how does anything work?
</p>

<p>
	Like seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Like what is your explanation for why you don't fall through the floor of your room?
</p>

<p>
	Think about it.
</p>

<p>
	What is an explanatory framework at all? And how much does it really explain?
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality reveals that all the workings of the universe are spontaneously self-manifesting beyond explanation. Or, in other words: the universe is fundamentally, irreducibly mystical, or mysterious.
</p>

<p>
	At rock bottom everything is consciousness and consciousness interacts with the only thing there is: it self!

<p>
	Yes, which is why it's useful to distinguish between relative truth and absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth has no opposite. It is none other than this present experience you are having.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is everything that is, but recontextualized as nondual being.
</p>

<p>
	The only difference between experience and being is that expeirence assumes the context of an ego, a subject who is having the expeirence, whereas with being there is no more subject, subject and object are one. Objects are thus self-illuminating or self-knowing.

<title>Questions about Contemplation</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Depends on what sort of questions you seek answers to.
</p>

<p>
	Start by contemplating simple ordinary things like: Why do people lie? What is anger? What is fear? What is success? Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Those you can get answers to pretty easily just by mulling themÂ over and observing your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	More profound questions like -- What is existence? What am I? What is God? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is death? What is a distinction?Â -- requireÂ transcending the mind into mystical states of consciousness. This can take a lot of focus and work, and it's tricky because the mind itself will get in the way of the answer. The answer to these questions will be experiential, not verbal or logical.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to answer your questionÂ by taking a psychedelic. You will see within minutes what the answers to such questions feel like. They are often hyper-intuitive, non-verbal, non-linear, and trans-rational.
</p>

<p>
	I used to think infinity was just a dumb brute force process, but then it was revealed to me that this is not so.
</p>

<p>
	You are so intelligent that you designed every molecule in the universe to work perfectly together and then forgot about it.
</p>

<p>
	Pure intelligence is so infinite it can materialize objects from thin air.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a Jedi who can spawn a star destroyer with his mind. That is the power of God-mind. It's way too radical to believe. It defies all physical laws.

<p>
	No experience lasts forever. They all end. The only thing that can last forever is Nothingness and it is not painful.
</p>

<p>
	So in the long run you can look forward to Nothingness <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />Â That is why enlightenment is the ultimate Good, and why God is ultimately Good.
</p>

<p>
	There is literally nothing to fear. All fear is illusion. You just need to become conscious enough to see this. And that can only happenÂ with death (enlightenment).
</p>

<p>
	No ego, no problem.

<p>
	No, but your sufferring would stop, thereby elimating the problem.
</p>

<p>
	No self, no problem.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you cannot stop all murder, but you can become so conscious that if you were murdered, it would not bother you.

			Yeah.

		<p>
			But what if I embrace everything, and then since I did that, god (myself) sticks my ego inside a dimension where I feel intense pain(torture basically)Â for an infinite amount of linear time, further more, in this dimension, go has made it so I am stuck in the ego, and cannot escape, he has also made it impossible for me to accept anything , or to love anything, even to try to, so I cant even in embrace the intense pain because I have no free-will.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since god has to include everything, that is one of the dimensions/realitys.
		</p>

		<p>
			What then? What if God did that to you?Â  What would you do then? This is a serious question. I'm not trying to criticise you or anything, but, what if I decided to do that to myself?Â

<p>
	This happens everyday to millions of people in the world. Millions of peole suffer pain like you can not imagine.
</p>

<p>
	What then? You would suffer until you died. When sufferring gets severe enough it goes full circle into peace. With enough suffering the ego-mind will simply shut off and die, thereby ending the sufferring.
</p>

<p>
	Linear time is not infinite. All form, all experience will one day end.
</p>

<p>
	Death itself is total bliss. The act of dying, maybe not so much.

If your an ego that lives for infinity, that means, you only get to experiance that ego and nothing else ever, therefore, avoiding parts of yourself. And god could make it so that happens to your or my ego,and make it so we also experience intense pain
		</p>

<p>
	Ego is an illusion. It is not infinite and nothing formed lasts forever.
</p>

<p>
	Ego cannot be immortal. Only the no-self is immortal, and it is bliss beyond anything you can imagine.

<title>Why Are Mainstream Scientists Afraid Of Fringe Ideas?</title>

<p>
	The strength and weakness of science is that it's conservative. For science to be able to claim a monopoly on the "truth" is must create a boundary between itself and falsehood. Then this boundary must be maintained by upholding rigorous standards for "proof". This is its strength and weakness. It's precisely because science tries to be so rigorous that it ends up excluding all truths which science hasn't yet figured out how to rigorously prove.
</p>

<p>
	Proof is always a smaller subset of truth, as Kurt Godel proved! There are many thinga which are true which are impossible to prove. Like existence, for example! Try to prove that the world exists. You can't!
</p>

<p>
	This is basically the same problem as with anti-virus software. In trying so hard to defend your PC it ends up denying many legit software and websites from working.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that a poorly tunedÂ anti-virus software ends up becoming the worst software on your PC.
</p>

<p>
	A prime example of how evil and deception happens in the name of good.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry about it because you will be dead by then.
</p>

<p>
	The Void Self willÂ live through aÂ trillionÂ lives. But you are not going to know it because you are one of those lives now. You don't have enough elevation to see the full picture.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that you already died a bunch of times as Napoleon,Â Hitler, etc. You just don't have access to those memories in this incarnation. So it's no problem for you.
</p>

<p>
	The issue here is that who you think you are, are your memories. Those memories will get wiped. Those memories are not the ultimate you, they are the illusory you. Any fear you have is also part of the illusory you.

<p>
	Distinction isÂ prior to thought.
</p>

<p>
	Thought IS one kind of distinction!
</p>

<p>
	Words cannot get at what distinction is. So even though I am using the word "distinction" here, which comes with the concept of a distinction, that concept is NOT what I am talking about! I meanÂ ACTUAL distinction, not the concept of one.
</p>

<p>
	Of courseÂ the concept of a distinction is also a distinction, but it is only one out of many and not what we are ultimately pointing to when we ask "What is a distinction?"
</p>

<p>
	This is whereÂ things get very Zen.
</p>

<p>
	If you still think distinction is a thought or a concept, you aren't getting it yet.
</p>

	Everything is a distinction. Seperation does not exist. Just because two things are distinct does not mean they are seperate.
</p>

<p>
	Most of you guys here have no idea yet how profound distinction is. If you were fully conscious of what a distinction is, you would understand all of existence!

<p>
	It is worth your while to seriously contemplate "What is a distinction?" Take your time with this one. There's a lot more to it than meetsÂ the eye.

	In other words, this money will solve nothing in your life.
</p>

<p>
	You still lack clarity aboutÂ what you want and nothing will solve that except clarity about what you want.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I would not hinge my plans on this money unless you have the cash in your hands. Half a mil in a few years sounds very suspicious. When it comes to thingsÂ like that, they usually never pan out.

Relative is a very accurate and good word.
</p>

<p>
	Relative is precisely what conventional understanding, science, and awareness is. Relative as in: Einstein's General Relativity. Relative as in: one thing is understood in relation or by contrast to another. In other words, dualistic understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, it's not absolute, but we mostly live and survive in the relative domain. So don't reject it too much.
</p>

<p>
	Relative and conceptual are not identical. The size of objects is relative for example.
</p>

<title>The Voice Is Not You [Let's discuss, also help me]</title>

<p>
	The metaphor of the image and the LCD screen comes in handy here. The image is both separate from the screen but also not other than the screen itself.
</p>

<p>
	The voice IS you, but not all of you. The voice is like one image on a screen.
</p>

<p>
	Perception is actually only possible because you ARE the things you perceive. Perception is BEING plus ego. Being is perception minus ego.

Stick to low doses. You don't need more than 200ug to have all the deepest insights. It's not the size of the dose, it's how you use it.

<p>
	Summon love within you to reject it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let evil boss you around. Love is more powerful. You can bank on that.
</p>

<p>
	Hone a genuine intention to be loving. Keep honing it more and more every day and eventually you will become unstoppable.

<title>100 Î¼g AL-LAD Trip Report</title>

<p>
	AlwaysÂ take psychedelics on a totally empty stomach. At least 4 hours from your last meal. This is key.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just a matter of a longer come up. The food changes the quality of the trip. It weighs you down and takes blood away from your brain.
</p>

<p>
	You can eat some snacks a few hours into the trip, after the peak. Keep it light. Always have some healthy snacks ready the day before.
</p>

<p>
	AL-LAD gets really profound at 150ug and above. That was just a baby dose.
</p>

<p>
	This is where the distinction between relative and absolute truth becomes handy.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is not a belief, it is actuality (as pointed toÂ in my What Is Actuality episode.) Absolute Truth is non-conceptual.
</p>

<p>
	Relative truth is conceptual. It's all the useful concepts you learn doing personal development and it explains how to practically navigate the world. For example, "don't eat bad food or you will feel bad." Spiral Dyanmics and all of science is relative truth. These relative truths are very important, but you want to hold them loosely and hear many perspectives so you don't get stuck.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth can only be accessed through direct mystical experience. You cannot learn it.
</p>
