</p>

<p>
	The pencil has the exact same scale as the Milky Way galaxy. Because all objects have the same scale: infinite.
</p>

<p>
	It works just like a fractal. Each scale of the fractal is the same.

<p>
	Those rules will be corrupted and used to teach devilry, as happened with Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and all the rest.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot script consciousness! This is what you're not understanding and what Sadhguru has neglected to teach you.
</p>

<p>
	Any time you script consciousness, it ceases being consciousness.

<p>
	What you're under-estimating is that Shambhavi will be corrupted once Sadhguru dies. As all spiritual techniques are. And then the fools who practice it blindly, blindly believing it to be the absolute purest thing (because you drilled that idea into their conformist heads), will end up devils.

<p>
	Actually it's not.
</p>

<p>
	From the followers' POV, there is no difference. The person being worshiped doesn't matter. What matters it the conformity with which the person is worshiped and the worshiping itself.
</p>

<p>
	Structure vs content is what matters. Devilry isn't in the content, it's in the structure. Christians have killed more people than Nazis.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you will that more people end up killed in the name of Sadhguru than Jesus. If you don't take this possibility seriously, you're not understanding the depth of what I'm talking about.

<p>
	Again, tell that to Hitler.
</p>

<p>
	Every powerful tool gets co-opted by devils. The devil is not interested in co-opting weak tools. He want's the most powerful ones. The devil wants to corrupt the highest good, the highest truth. So you proclaiming that you have the highest good and highest truth only attracts the devil closer.

	By not understanding this, devilry is created.

<p>
	It's not ironic at all. It's precisely my point.
</p>

<p>
	I have taught from the very beginning that self-deception is a powerful force and I am not above it. Realizing that no one is above self-deception is a key step in reducing one's self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	As soon as you think you're above self-deception, you're fucked.
</p>

<p>
	This work is not about reaching perfection. This work is about constant vigilance of how your mind is tricking you.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Almost all spiritual schools offer some step by step process. It doesn't stop devilry. A step by step process is by definition mechanical and unconscious. The more simple, linear, and mechanical you make spirituality, the more potential for devilry.
</p>

<p>
	You guys are underestimating how relentless and sneaky devilry is.
</p>

<p>
	The devil precisely co-opts the highest spiritual teaching. The devil eats gurus and his followers for breakfast. This is the devil's specialty. This is what he's best at: corrupting the highest spiritual teachings.
</p>

<p>
	You've been warned.
</p>

<p>
	But of course my warning will largely go unheeded. Such is the work of the devil. So carry on with your devilry. Just don't be surprised when you open the newspaper and see devilry on every page, including the spirituality section. And don't be surprised when you see Isha involved in some scandal.
</p>

<p>
	And of course you must also realize, Isha will one day splinter into multiple rival factions who will start to fight with each other over Sadhguru's true intentions. Each faction will believe that they know best what Sadhguru really wanted. And they will have no qualms about attacking the other side. Because hey, Sadhguru is God and he told us what's right.
</p>

<p>
	If you're serious about this work you should start to notice these meta-patterns of spiritual communities. All of this has been well worn throughout the last 5000 years of history. Nothing new or surprising here. It's all duality 101.
</p>

<p>
	My only point is: don't take devilry for granted. Your mind is doing it.
</p>

	This kind of simplistic black & white thinking is precisely what leads to devilry.

<p>

	There you go again. This kind of mindless black & white thinking is precisely the problem. You have it in your mind that Sadhguru can do no wrong and that no one else can point out a blindspot. This is very thing I warn my students about over and over again.

<p>
	This problem should largely auto-correct itself once you have a strong sense of life purpose. A man grounded in his life purpose is to busy actualizing his bold vision for the world to have time for such nonsense. Most of your time, skills, and money should be going into your LP, so that little is left over for others to leech. Of course occasionally you can generous, but overall you're not working to help random people, you're working to actualize your vision for the world (which is a more coherent, deliberate, and powerful way to help others). Think of your life purpose as simply an organized and very strategic way of helping elevate the most people in the world according to your unique skill set. Which means that if you're not doing that, if you helping people randomly on their terms, you're actually hurting the world overall.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I don't need to worry about helping every random homeless person I see on the streets because my time is better invested in shooting videos and helping people via my business. My business was designed in such a way that it already incorporates that desire to help others.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, help others, but on your terms, not on their terms. Then you don't get used by vampires. Be deliberate about how you want to help people. Don't leave it up to chance. Don't wait for a homeless person to approach you.
</p>

<p>
	You're not acknowledging that it's a double-edged sword.
</p>

<p>
	It can lead to good things. But it can also lead to lots of devilry.
</p>

<p>
	It's not merely other people's problem. It will be a problem for you and for Isha as a whole, as Isha becomes a collective ego it will commit evil in the same of your saint, Sadhguru, who will be rolling in his grave.
</p>

<p>
	This is the main reason why I don't start an organization like Isha. Once a hierarchy is established, it will commit evil in the name of God. History clearly bears this out.

	Sure seems that way. And Sadhguru is great. But it's precisely his greatness which will create blindness and devilry.

	As if Jesus was not an admirable God-like being? Lol. Oldest mistake in the book. The more God-like the teacher is, the bigger the problem for his followers.

<p>
	Be careful assuming that. That's a big assumption.

<p>
	The truth is, it's really not in Sadhguru's hands. Isha will take on a life of its own and Sadhguru will be rolling in his grave at some of the things they do after he's gone.

	Every spiritual teaching degrades over time. It's like making a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy on your copy machine. It's not gonna get better. It's gonna get worse than the original.

<p>
	Yes, definitely.
</p>

<p>
	There are phases in this work when you're doing lots of general research but not getting much tangible results. And there are phases where you're practicing a narrow set of techniques and seeing tangible results but not doing much research.
</p>

<p>
	You can naturally cycle between these phases depending on what your life requires.
</p>

<p>
	You'll need to dynamically balance between the two extremes.
</p>

<p>
	Watching a bunch of my videos will fill your head will too much theory and not enough tangible results. And yet, that theory will serve you well in the future when you get stuck or lost.

	Things tend to auto-correct themselves in the long-run. Too much theory should naturally drive you to crave results. And vice versa.

<p>
	Which is why it will take some 100+ years.

<p>
	Starting a significant cultural movement takes a long time.

<p>
	We have a better chance of simply evolving current humans. And anyways, you shouldn't be too worried about spiritual competition. There exist beings in our universe 1 million times more conscious and advanced than humans. So it's really not a race. We can only do so much so fast.

<p>
	Actually, yes. (But hopefully less of an <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/linus-torvalds-apologises-for-hurtful-behavior-takes-a-break-512668" rel="external nofollow">asshole</a>).
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org was deliberately designed to be an open-source spiritual platform.
</p>

<p>
	That is one reason I advocate psychedelics. Once you have a supply of 5-MeO-DMT, you no longer need me or Actualized.org
</p>

<p>
	The most important function of 5-MeO-DMT is that it democratizes spirituality in a way that no guru can. With access to 5-MeO-DMT you no longer need to look up to gurus for answers. You become your own guru.
</p>

<p>
	The difference is that on an Actualized.org forum you can freely discuss Sadhguru's programs. But on an Isha forum you would not be discussing other spiritual programs. It would be discouraged. Very few spiritual schools encourage the cross-comparison of all other spiritual schools. Most of them discourage it out of self-bias. Most of them don't even care to understand anything outside the school.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, closed spiritual systems will not be good enough for mankind's evolution. The future will require cross-understanding between all spiritual schools, as the world becomes too global and interconnected for anything less.

<p>
	Not all things can be found through such naive direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a counter-example which throws a wrench in your logic:
</p>

<p>
	Sushi seems healthy and delicious. Eating it makes you feel good compared to many other foods. It's light and refreshing and not over-cooked. But if you take this as a sign of health and you start eating sushi 4 times a week, eventually you'll discover it gives your lead and mercury poisoning. Your brain will start to function poorly as it fills with more and more heavy metals and you won't even know what's wrong with you until you get some medical tests which finally reveal the truth.
</p>

<p>
	The moral of the story is that not all problems can be solved through straight direct experience. Sometimes you need an external source like an x-ray or a satellite photo or a Geiger counter to tell you something is unhealthy or problematic.
</p>

<p>
	Also, some things are so dangerous that it's too risky to discover so through direct experience. For example, sticking a fork in the wall socket. In this case you just have to take people's word for it.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Haha, they already are.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately advanced yogic practice is not enough to eliminate dogma. In a sense, the more successful the practice, the bigger the problem. The success of the practice justified the dogma in the person's mind. "After all, if these techniques works so well, then teaching them rigidly can't be wrong."
</p>

<p>
	Dogma is not a function content, it's a function of cognitive structure. And I don't see Sadhguru teaching his students how to avoid dogma by exposing them to diverse sources and teachings. So his students will not have an deep integrated stage Yellow/Turquoise spirituality. They will have a narrow Isha spirituality. Isha will be best in their minds. Sadhguru will be best and worshiped as some ultimate master. This of course will lead to bigotry.
</p>

<p>
	I like Sadhguru, but his programs are not designed to encourage deep, independent contemplation or inquiry. They are designed for sheeple to blindly follow. It's sort of like the Apple eco-system. It's used by the least computer savvy people who just want a simple experience. But it's a closed, proprietary eco-system. And you better expect Apple to milk you for the convenience. It's in Apple self-interest to lock you in to their walled garden. But a wall is still a wall even if it's a spiritual wall.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Constructing temples only deepens the problem as it reinforces the myth of Sadhguru. The more tangible the benefits of the temple, the worse the problem. If I built an Actualized temple which gave you legit visions of God every time you entered it, Actualized would quickly become a cult.

<p>
	Yes, this will become a big issue in the next 100-200 years.
</p>

<p>
	But right now we have so many exploited and suffering humans that worrying about animal suffering is basically a luxury. We simply aren't advanced enough as a species to end such animal suffering. Not yet. One day we will.
</p>

<p>
	In the next 100 years our technology should get so good that we will be able to grow meat in a lab.
</p>

<p>
	You are never going to get rid of eating meat. But we could make the manufacture of that meat free of suffering. We are getting close. Soon it will only be a question of scale and cost.
</p>

<p>
	Of course we can work on both issues at once -- which is already happening. But human suffering will always be a first priority because we are human and survival drives us.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not an ego-defense per se. It's just a lack of vision, leadership, and empathy.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of people in society are suffering due to exploitation by those in power. Yet you don't care much about addressing that because you're in a relatively comfortable position yourself. If your daughter was raped, enslaved, or poisoned by some giant corporation dumping toxic chemicals in your water supply, you'd sing a different tune. All the sudden you'd take this stuff seriously because it now impinges on your survival agenda whereas before it was an intellectual abstraction.
</p>

<p>
	You would feel very differently about global warming if you bought a $1 million house and it was sunk under water in 5 years. But so long as it doesn't personally cause you suffering, you don't care much.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's perfect for the big oil companies. That's exactly what they want. While you sit around and wait, they will rake in $100 billion. Millions of people in 3rd world counties will be dislocated, famine and desertification will get real bad, wars will be waged, and new terrorist groups will form. But none of that will matter to the guys who rake in $100 billion.
</p>

<p>
	And it won't matter to you until one of those terrorists blows up your daughter's school. But even then you'll probably just get angry at the terrorist group rather than connecting the dots and seeing how the terrorist group was merely an outgrowth of the global warming problem which lead to geopolitical stress in impoverished parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
	In this way, root problems are never seriously understood or addressed.
</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			I always thought that great government is equal combination of left and right, as they tend to reduce the stupid decisions made by their opposition. Is this what you mean? The average is found through the arguments of two opposites, not the one "almost close to the truth" ?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's precisely a recipe for disaster. The correct path forward is never an average of all the possible paths. Finding the right path requires careful judgment, research, contextual awareness, awareness of exploiters and manipulators, and ultimately wisdom and consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Finding the correct path requires a visionary. One who can look 100 years into the future and think in a non-self-biased way, aligned with Truth, Consciousness, and Love. Such a person must be selfless enough to sacrifice himself to show people the correct path, because he will be vehemently demonized and resisted by self-biased devils defending their self-interest.
</p>

<p>
	Progress and innovation requires deep questioning of status quo positions and traditions. Nothing can be taken for granted. What's "normal" must be questioned and challenged without any concern for social norms. In a society where slavery is considered normal, it takes a radical to stand up and say, "This is not normal at all! This is devirly! You guys are selfish fucking devils."
</p>

<p>
	Seeking to always be nice, peaceful, and "moderate" paradoxically leads to the rise of radicalism. When 100s of millions of people around the world are deeply suffering and deeply exploited, and you ignore this because you want to be "moderate" and congenial (because you are in a position of comfort), don't be surprised when those oppressed people organize and come after you with pitchforks. When they burn down your house, maybe you'll reconsider your moderate position.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is intellectual until someone burns down your house or rapes your kids. Then you start paying attention.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this is a great thought experiment which I indirectly referred to. Unfortunately most people cannot preform it because they are too self-biased and they are not conscious of: 1) their privileges, 2) how bad life is for some people on this planet. And ultimately they don't care because all they are about is increasing their personal survival advantage, regardless of where they are situated in the hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
	Watch that Vice documentary video on Liberia and imagine that you were born there. If that doesn't open your political eyes, nothing will.
</p>

<p>
	A big part of the libertarian and conservative fantasy is that they assume everyone is as equally capable and privileged as them.
</p>

<p>
	Most conservatives cannot even imagine that 200 years ago it was only a matter of luck that they were not born slaves or terrorists. In their minds such an outrage isn't even a possibility. Because they purely see themselves as "the good guys". It does not enter a conservative's mind that he could be born a mentally crippled kid in a poor urban neighborhood to drug addicted parents surviving on food stamps, so someone predisposed to drug addiction.
</p>

<p>
	A conservative mind is not capable of such empathy. For example, an Evangelical cannot imagine being born a Wahhabist Muslim. Nor can a materialist scientist, really. Which is why they demonize divergent worldviews. It takes an extraordinarily developed and open mind to run such thought experiments in an objective, non-self-biased way.
</p>

<p>
	Rawls' through experiment is only the tip of the iceberg. It's not merely that you COULD be born as someone else. It's that you WILL be born as EVERYONE else! It's that YOU ARE EVERYONE ELSE! The moment you realize this your entire politics is revolutionized. You can on longer advance positions which exploit the ignorance and weaknesses of others. Because it's like fucking over your own mother on her birthday.

His teachings will be so outdated and antiquated as to be counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	If history has taught us anything, spirituality must be reinvented for each new generation.
</p>

<p>
	Even the language and metaphors Sadhguru uses today in his videos will be hard to understand in 500 years. In the same way that it's almost impossible for ordinary people to read Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
	Even today Sadhguru's integration of cutting edge spiritual tools like psychedelics is outdated and crude. Just imagine how outdated it will be in 500 years when we use genetic engineering to transform the structure of the human brain. The spirituality of the future will be much more radical than anything that has occurred in human history in the last 10,000 years. The next 1000 years will be nuts! It will be completely unpredictable and it will require extreme mental flexibility and innovative new spiritual teachings which bridge the divide between science, technology, society, and spirituality.

			That's the problem with books like Conversations with God imo. It's an unverifiable and self-referencing belief system.<br />

		<p>
			Because you would cast it off as a hallucination! It's the perfect way to close the circle and cast aside doubts that any of it is real.

<p>
	What you fail to appreciate is that God CANNOT fulfill your wish because God has no form. It can only come through a vehicle, and this can always be denied.
</p>

<p>
	By it's very nature God cannot force itself on a person in denial because the one denying God is God!
</p>

<p>
	God explained this to you in the book. Yet you missed this important point.
</p>

<p>
	God IS a closed circle. If you do not realize that God is talking through you, you're shit out of luck. Because you denied yourself, because you are God.
</p>

<p>
	If God appeared in a glowing white robe and beard on the White House lawn tomorrow, and procliamed, "HEAR ME HUMANS! I AM YOUR GOD!" Most people would laugh, denying it, and some would even try to kill it and subject the corpse to scientific testing, at which point they would conclude: "this was just an ordinary human with some brain defects."
</p>

<p>
	So it is imposisble for God to reveal itself to humans because humans are too stupid and closedminded to understand God.
</p>

<p>
	This seems like a cop out. And yet it's precisely true. Because you are God denying you are God. If you don't get that you're God. That's it. You're fucked. Even God cannot help you now. This is the definition of devilry: you have cut yourself off from God by your own ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is that God speaks to and through everything, but you must have enough wisdom to see it. And neither science nor skepticism nor proof is wisdom.
</p>

If Sadhguru's words are taught precisely 1000 years from now, it will be as bad as religion because the society will have changed so much that adaptation will be necessary.
</p>

<p>
	But I understand his concern. We wants to minimize devilry. Unfortunately he can't stop a stage Blue organization from avoiding devilry because such people are dogmatic by definition and he feeds into their dogma a bit.
</p>

<p>
	After he's dead the whole thing will become another religion.

</p>

<p>
	Centrism just means you're basically going with the status quo, adding a little lipstick to a pig.
</p>

<p>
	You have no vision for how great mankind could be.
</p>

<p>
	And, see... as an centrist you're extremely easy to fool. All one has to do is stack the argument with extremist positions and you'll reflexively just adopt the half-way point.
</p>

<p>
	So one side says: Abolish slavery. The other side says: let's get even more slaves. And you say: let's be reasonable and just keep the slaves we have.
</p>

<p>
	Or one side says: global warming is a serious threat. The other side says: global warming is a hoax. And you say: who really knows? Let's wait and see.
</p>

<p>
	All I have to do to fool you is fund a think tank which generates whatever serves my agenda, and you'll always split the difference because you don't evaluate anything on the merits of it by simply take the mid-point. So I just manipulate you by making sure to put forth such extreme positions that your mid-point ends but being exactly what best serves me and my interests. So if it serves me to own 50 slaves, I will set my position to be: I should be able to own 1000 slaves. And you as the centrist will go, "Okay, 1000 is too many slaves. Let's be reasonable. You can have 100." Deal!
</p>

<p>
	What you're missing is that truth and rightness are the average of any two positions.
</p>

<p>
	You can't take a multiple choice exam, mark every answer "C", and expect to ace the class. If only life were so easy. Rarely is the answer "C".
</p>

			What you have is a societal problem, and you're offloading it onto ALL businesses. This means small businesses are highly impacted from raising minimum wage. Leftists seem to only think about some evil rich billionaire with big box stores like Walmart.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	1) Business's whole strategy is to strong arm and use enormous leverage to manipulate wages. An average person has little chance to negotiate for a fair wage. They are forced to take whatever offered, which usually undervalues their work. This is the core reason why a minimum wage is needed. To not address this point is to be naive about how business negotiation works. He with the most leverage takes the cake.
</p>

<p>
	2) The idea that a living wage would hurt small biz is silly. A living wage could eaily be a requirement only above a certain number of empolyees. For example, all companies worth over $100 million or employing more than 100 people.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of using the "this will kill small biz" excuse is to conflate giant multi-national business with small mom and pop shops so that the giant multi-national can squeeze their employees dry.
</p>

<p>
	A company like Walmart or McDonalds should be paying a living wage. This doesn't need to affect tiny businesses.
</p>

<p>
	Living wage can easily be adjustable to cost of living per state and county. So in LA it could be $25/hr while in Alabama it could be $10/hr.
</p>

<p>
	People make all sorts of bad arguments aboug minimum wage simply because they have an ideological position against it and no understanding of how corporations use leverage in negotiations.

	Yes, such a period in one's life can be stressful and exhausting.
</p>

<p>
	Starting a biz is not easy and eats up a lot of time and energy. But if you do it right, it will pay dividends for the rest of your life.
</p>

<p>
	Starting my own biz was one of the best decisions I ever made, enough though it was challenging and stressful at times.
</p>

<p>
	Just make sure you don't burn yourself out.

<title>How to tell my parents about psychedelics?</title>

<p>
	In practice you probably shouldn't because they will not understand.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to reverse an irrational paranoia. Parents tend to be closedminded about such things, like naive children pretending to be good parents. It's ironic.

That's basically how I expect it to work.
</p>

<p>
	Of course God cannot stay in God mode all the time, otherwise there would be no human birth. At some point God has to choose to forget and re-enter the Matrix.
</p>

<p>
	What should you do? Enjoy your Creation. Be the Creator and all that entails.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's all meaningless in the end. That's what makes it so meaningful!
</p>

<p>
	It's an Infinite Game.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, awakening robs you of a certain innocence. There is a certain bliss to being asleep and clueless. It's fun to play a new video game, getting all excited about acheiving something in it. It's no fun playing a game you yourself designed just like it's no fun watching a magic trick you've deeply studied.

Child with large and overactive amygdala (which he got in a genetic lottery) will build an identity of a fearful person, cause his amygdala fires in social "events". As opposed to a child with small and underactive amygdala who may even have some sociopathic tendencies cause no inhibitions.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Nothing I said denies the genetic base. Obviously a child born with 1 leg and 1 arm will have very different survival obstacles than one who is born "normal". His childhood will be very "problematic" as he has to figure out how to deal with kids laughing at him, girls rejecting him, self-esteem issues, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This actually supports my point: your genetics is really just the original "childhood problem". Whatever your genetics are, you'll be dealing with the fallout of that your whole life. If you are born a woman, that's one kind of genetic problem. If you are born a man, that's another kind of genetic problem. And so on. And of course all of these "genetic problems" become cultural and social problems.
</p>

<p>
	It does not matter what your genetics are, whatever they are, they define the scope of your survival. If you are born a cat, you will be dealing with "cat problems" your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot separate genetic problems from behavioral problems from societal problems from childhood traumas. It's all interconnected.
</p>

<p>
	10g is a reckless dose, and really a waste since it will be too much for you to retain.
</p>

<p>
	Take 2g and contemplate next time.
</p>

<p>
	You could have seriously injured yourself with a 10g dose as a newbie. WTF were you thinking?
</p>

<p>
	Newbies should start with 1g.

	No matter how deeply you explore it, you will always be infinitely far away from reaching the end. No matter how far back in time you go, you will be infinitely far away from finding its beginning. Not because you are too limited as a human, but because a beginning and end simply do not exist.

<title>How do I know if I had a breakthrough on 5-MeO DMT? Should I up the dosage?</title>

<p>
	If you're in doubt it ain't a breakthrough. Just gradually up your dose until you get there.
</p>

<p>
	Never combine 5-MeO-DMT with MOAI.

<p>
	By big business I mean large corporations that deal with millions of customers.
</p>

<p>
	There are certain scales of biz which require very different approaches.
</p>

<p>
	$0 to $1mil
</p>

<p>
	$1mil to $5mil
</p>

<p>
	$5mil to $20mil
</p>

<p>
	$100mil+
</p>

<p>
	Those are very different beasts.
</p>

<p>
	To take your biz from $3mil to $20mil will require radically changing how you do business.

<p>
	I didn't start any large corporation, nor did I ever use investors to start my businesses.
</p>

<p>
	You just gotta be creative. You can run a small biz and do well.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you'll be working long hours to make your small biz thrive. Then you'll understand why long hours are common.
</p>

<p>
	There exist many opportunities for small businesses. There are many market niches which are too small to sustain large corporations so they can't compete with you.
</p>

<p>
	Business is just like the animal kingdom. The biggest animals are not the only game in town. In fact, most animals are small ones. You can be a highly successful small animal. But you gotta be more creative, clever, and strategic than the big guys.

<title>How the hell did Hegel know about non-dual/buddhist ideas?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/39617-how-the-hell-did-hegel-know-about-non-dualbuddhist-ideas/?do=findComment&amp;comment=496424</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The mistake is assuming Buddhism is somehow original. Buddhism just mirrors reality.
</p>

<p>
	Hegel doesn't need to know about Buddhism, he just need to be conscious of reality.
</p>

<p>
	He was a Christian and he deeply understood Christianity. Not as it's practiced today, but in the old school idealist mystical sense.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that a lot of old philosophers and scientists were more right about metaphysics than scientists are today precisely because they were Christians, and Christianity is grounded in the deepest truth there is. It just happens to also be very corrupt. So the real question is, How did Hegel manage to escape the corruption of Christianity?
</p>

<p>
	Hegel may not have been a meditator in the Buddhist sense, but he was obviously a deep contemplator and closely studied his direct experience. Which is the equivalent of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	He also deeply studied Heraclitus.
</p>

<p>
	When Heraclitus was asked, How did you become enlightened? He replied,
</p>

<p>
	"I studied myself."
</p>

<title>Martin Seligman: Childhood has nothing to do with our problems</title>

<p>
	I would actually say just the opposite:
</p>

<p>
	All of your current dysfunctions in life are the result of past events.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so simple as correlating some one horrid childhood event to your current problem. It's much more complex. All problems are the result of whatever the "self" you identify as. This "self" was constructed as a reaction to survival challenges in the past. The "self" is nothing more than a survival mechanism. So of course it's highly conditioned by upbringing, childhood, teenage years, and early adulthood. Whatever stuff happened to you between the ages of 0 to 30 has shaped your personality almost totally to the point where you cannot even know what your self would be without it. Of course your are not just shaped by bad events but good events too.
</p>

<p>
	Of course none of this means you can't change.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bad idea to listen to academic psychologists when it comes to understanding the dynamics of the self. Broad surveys and studies are not gonna cut it here. This requires existential level insight through direct work on oneself.
</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself where your "self" came from? You'll see it was from the past. In fact, your entire mind came from the past. Every word you use came from your past. 99% of the ideas in your mind came from your past. You hardly invented anything new. You are like a snowball rolling down hill collecting more snow and dirt.
</p>

<p>
	But the strange looping twist here is, the past is just a figment of your mind! There never was a past or a self or a world! You made it all up. You sneaky devil, you.
</p>

<p>
	Survival has everything to do with your problems. Without survival there is no problem at all.
</p>

It basically is whatever we say it is.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel courageous you can post your pic on:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://hotornot.com/" rel="external nofollow">https://hotornot.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	And they will rate you from 0-10.
</p>

<p>
	But it would really be better for your self-esteem not to submit yourself to such mob evaluation of your self-worth. In the end you gotta love your genetics however they happen to be. Can't change that (yet).
</p>

<p>
	You must play with the hand life has dealt you.
</p>

<p>
	If it's of any consolation, all the "hot" people will eventually become not. So this is a bullet you'll have to bite at one point or another in life. You can't really avoid it. It's just a matter of time. It's a good idea not to base your self-esteem or happiness on your physical appearance. Or else you'll be in for a world of hurt.
</p>

<p>
	The great news is, you are not a physical being at all.

<p>
	On a practical level sleeping with lots of women is just unsustainable for many reasons. In the end you'll find it takes up way too much time and energy which could be put to better use.
</p>

<p>
	Consider, if you were truly happy, you'd have little need to sleep around with many women. Or really, any women at all.

<p>
	Indeed. If you were wise you'd see that happiness is all that matters and therefore fucking as many hot women as possible would cease to interest you. But as of now you're still to unconscious, immature, and needy to realize this.
</p>

<p>
	Your attachment is to your dick. So you're very much attached here.
</p>

<p>
	If you really wanted to be detached you'd give up sex altogether and never think of it again. This would be the wise move. But of course you're too unconscious to pull it off.

<p>
	It's not a matter of morality. It's just foolish, immature, and self-defeating.
</p>

<p>
	You are thinking with your dick. Which is not way of the sage.
</p>

<p>
	By all means, think with your dick as much as you want. But don't expect that to go well.
</p>

<p>
	The less you think with your dick, the better your life will go, the happier you'll be.
</p>

<p>
	It's counter-intuitive not to think with your dick.

<p>
	That's because "hot" is literally defined by that which is in the top 5%.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not that most women are not hot. It's that what's hot is the top 5% of whatever is.
</p>

<p>
	If women were donkeys, you'd still be like, "These donkeys suck. I want a better donkey."
</p>

<p>
	That's survival. Always looking for the most you can get for the least amount of effort.

<title>Public housing option - Why not build &quot;commie blocks&quot; all over the USA?</title>

			The head of these corporations make the laws. They could easily gather a bunch of lawyers to sue the government. That's why passive income gets taxed the least or 0%. Correct me if I'm wrong.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course corporations are a source of government corruption and rig the laws to serve their survival.
</p>

<p>
	But the problem is far deeper than that. Complex technology and massive scales of life (human society in the 100s of millions) requires massive infrastructure and collective forms of organization. We cannot just go back to living in little tribes in some hippie eco-village. The whole challenge here is that individual humans are not the end-all-be-all of life. Life has surpassed humans to include corporations, organizations, religions, social movements, cultures, governments, nations, and beyond. Massive complexity and bureaucracy is necessary to sustain things like nuclear weapons, gasoline cars, airports, highways, currency, the internet, GPS satellites, regulation of pollution & deforestation, regulation of endangered species, modern medicine, modern food, modern electronics, etc.
</p>

<p>
	None of that could exist without corporations or giant bureaucracies.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot build a modern home by yourself, or even with a small group of your friends. Modern housing construction requires sophisticated supply chains, regulation, infrastructure, factories, shipping containers, airports, railroad, power plants, mining, logging, and a thousand other things.
</p>

<p>
	Starbucks does better than a family owned coffee shop precisely because it solves complex organizational problems like supply chain issues, warehousing, etc. and it delivers a very reliable, high-quality product which people love.
</p>

<p>
	You must always take into account the problem of scale. Scale! Scale! Scale! is what people underestimate. It's very easy to run a small coffee shop that serves 100 customers. It's a whole nother design challenge to serve good coffee consistently to 1 billion customers. What worked at the scale of 100 does not work at the scale of 1 billion. It's a whole new creature. And we live in a world were business is done in the billions, not in the thousands. If business is not done in the billions, say goodbye to your car, your TV, your house, your phone, your computer, your internet, your video games, your fave TV shows, your GPS, your vacations, your books, etc.

</p>

<p>
	The way to solve that problem is reducing the incentives to milk.
</p>

<p>
	Passive income is not needed to escape wage slavery. Passive income is what causes wage slavery.
</p>

<p>
	In the future everyone will have to generate creative value or not get paid.
</p>

<p>
	Income should be tied to how much creative value you can generate. Being a landlord is not adding significant creative value to society. You're just basically taking advantage of the fact that you have more money than others to earn even more money. Which is like standing on someone's shoulders while kicking them in the teeth.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone has creativity. Don't give me that excuse. It is your job in life to actualize your creativity rather than becoming a parasite.
