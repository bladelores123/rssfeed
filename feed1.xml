<p>
	Death is something Consciousness imagines, like Santa Claus.
</p>

<p>
	If you didn't think about it, it could not exist.

</p>

<p>
	This deconstruction is useful whether you want to use psychedelics or not. Even more fundamental than psychedelics is contemplation and deconstruction. The psychedelics are only lubricant for contemplation. The point of the videos is to provide a guide for deconstructing the mind and carefully questioning reality.
</p>

<p>
	You can question reality with or without psychedelics. Of course you'll get a lot further with them. But even without them it's still good.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you choose to meditate or do yoga, you will still need a hardcore questioning of reality. You can't just be a sheep and do practices without questioning.

<p>
	There exist thousands of different states of consciousness. Depresonalization disorder is one of those states, but it is NOT Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious that you are God? No? When you look at your body is it crystal clear that it is God? No? When you look at a lamp, is it cryatal clear that the lamp is God? No? Is it cryatal clear what the word "God" means? No? Is it crystal clear that birth and death are imaginary? No?
</p>

<p>
	Then you ain't Awake. You are in some other state.
</p>

<p>
	Any psychedelic will help you for starters. You got a long way to go till you can fully appreciate what 5-MeO has to show you.
</p>

<p>
	And even though meditation will not get you all the way to the top, it's still a good practice for you to you learn to focus your mind on the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	You can do any of the practices I've ever talked about. They are helpful.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is precisely what you see right now, minus your thoughts about it.

<p>
	There is no difference between a lamp and a human body. Both are just images on a screen.
</p>

<p>
	There are no "people". There are just some shapes which you say is a person. You might as well call a snowman a person.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at the world as if humans and animals never existed. But all shapes and colors are still the same as before. Just remove the humanness from it all.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine instead that you are the cosmos looking at itself.
</p>

<p>
	When you see a lamp, imagine that you are not looking at the lamp but that the lamp is seeing itself.
</p>

<p>
	The room you think you're in is actually self-seeing. Every object sees itself. And the net result is that it looks like this room "you see". You are the only thing which isn't real in the room.
</p>

<p>
	You are not in the room! There is just a room with objects in it like chairs and bodies.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	The purpose of it is to manipulate small parts of the dream to make yourself more comfortable in the dream.
</p>

<p>
	It's good for that.
</p>

<p>
	But it doesn't help you understand what reality is. Reality cannot be understood conceptually or with models.
</p>

<p>
	The epistemic value of QM is to show you that you cannot ever understand reality using science. You thought you could use science to get objective answers about reality, and QM showed that the only objective answer is that all scientific answers are necessarily relative and subjective.
</p>

<p>
	QM shows that you are chasing your own tail when you do science.
</p>

<p>
	Quantum mechanics is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine it right now. See?
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot notice right now that you are imagining quarks and Niels Bohr, nothing in the world can help you. You are lost in your mind and you lack the basic mindfulness skills needed to see it.
</p>

<p>
	You are inside a dream. Stop taking the contents of the dream seriously.

<p>
	Your personal desires are irrelevant when it comes to matters of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	You have to stop thinking about reality personally. It's not personal. Stop trying to get anything beneficial out of existence. Have the courage to be totally selfless.
</p>

<p>
	If you were totally selfless, it would not matter if you were sane or insane, alive or dead, healthy or sick, rich or poor, human or dog.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is selfless.
</p>

<p>
	When you are being selfish, you are being untruthful. You are falling into the illusion that one thing is better or worse than another. In Truth, there is no difference, no better, no worse. Being alive is not better than being dead. Being happy is not better than being in pain. That is Truth. But you don't want to accept it.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate freedom and joy is the realization that there is no difference between anything. This is what puts an end to struggle and suffering.
</p>

<p>
	So long as you believe that one thing is better than other, you will always suffer and struggle and be unhappy.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is the only salvation.
</p>

<p>
	You might have some underlying health issue. Maybe it's a disease or vitamin deficency, or mental health issue.
</p>

<p>
	I think you are getting ahead of your skiis. You need just basic self-help to ground yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Find a way not to hate your life before you go chasing enlightenment.

It seemed to suggest that God is learning with each new universe, so the current universe is not perfect. If god is absolutely unlimited in every way, why this learning process ? I am curious to know if you or anyone else has a take on this. (Probably worth a separate thread)
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	God is Absolute Perfection.
</p>

<p>
	It requires higher levels of Awakening to realize that.
</p>

<p>
	"imperfection" is a relative judgment made by a limited mind.
</p>

<p>
	If your mind became Infnite, you could not see imperfection. Because the Truth is you are Perfect.

<p>
	Healing is not Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	There are many great healers in the world. That doesn't make them Awake.

<p>
	I'm sure Sadhguru has many amazing abilities and skills. But that's not what I'm talking about.

	You should not do psychedelics then. Your foundation is too weak so you are getting into abuse territory.

	I guarantee you anyone you know who's so called "enlightened" will suffer if their health gets bad enough, and they will wish for their good health back.

<p>
	If I hit Sadhguru over the head with a hammer, his whole world will crash and he will struggle to do this job.

<p>
	Sadhguru in fact talks frankly about his serious past health problems.

			I have reservations with 5-MeO-DMT, not because of any dogma, but simply because it sounds too good to be true. From my limited experience, bigger prizes seem to require bigger efforts. Spiritual enlightenment is the ultimate prize, so it MUST require ultimate effort - years or decades of brutal practices. But Leo seems to have some strong convictions here, not sure what I'm missing.

<p>
	When people reason this way, the easiest way to hide the Truth becomes by making it too good to be true.
</p>

<p>
	Can you not see that your mind is using every trick possible to hide the Truth from you?
</p>

<p>
	Wherever you think the Truth cannot possibility be, that's precisely the best place to hide it.

	He didn't do enough 5-MeO. A handful of trips is not enough.

<p>
	It has taken me close to 100 breakthroughs to reach the highest levels.

<p>
	People stop far short of that because they cannot imagine what they are missing and they are not serious about exploring consciousness. They are looking for excuses to quit.

<p>
	You could make such a distinction.
</p>

<p>
	But what you really want is Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Your highest goal is Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	But these two are not at odds with one another. It's just a matter of depth. You can do both.

	Why do you take for granted that the experience happening right now is yours? What if it isn't yours? What if it just is, without you?
</p>

<p>
	Is the sky yours? No? Then why is the body yours?
</p>

<p>
	I have as much right to claim "your" body as mine as you have to claim it yours! Because it's all relative. It is whatever you imagine it to be.
</p>

<p>
	You can't understand what I'm saying because of you did, you'd disappear.
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally you cannot help assuming you are real. This assumption distorts your whole understanding of reality. It doesn't make sense to you how reality could exist without a human self. But the human self is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Name me one Buddhist who is Awake.
</p>

<p>
	I haven't ever met one.
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean he's wasting his time. You can gain much benefit from meditation, but you will not reach the highest levels of God realization.

<p>
	The question of who is Awake is not about power or being better than them. It's a practical matter because you need to know which methods will and which won't lead you to the highest levels of Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	That is all. It's not about a dick measuring contest.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you will ever fully Awaken through meditation, for example, I can tell you right now, that will never happen. Not even after 40 years. It's useful to know that so you don't waste time.
</p>

<p>
	I'm just trying to save you guys time.
</p>

<p>
	The way you have defined "you", you are not creating. Because you have defined yourself as a human, and a human certainly did not create the universe.
</p>

<p>
	But if you realize you are not a human but the whole universe, then you'll see that you are creating it by being it.
</p>

<p>
	You can't see how you're creating it because of who you imagine you are. And you imagine you are a human because that is what you needed to do to stay alive as one.

<p>
	Slow down your tripping. There's no rush. Over time as you trip your ability to handle the extra consciousness will build.
</p>

<p>
	You don't start drinking beer by chugging a keg. You start with one drink and build yourself up.
</p>

<p>
	A 5-MeO-DMT breakthrough is a radical thing. You may want to explore less radical psychedelics in smaller doses to build yourself up. Integration after each trip is key.
</p>

<p>
	Also you are comparing smoked 5-MeO-DMT to plugged DPT. These are very different substances. You're comparing apples and oranges. Plugged 5-MeO-DMT is nice and smooth. DPT will probably be more challenging for most people than 5-MeO-DMT. DPT is a tricky psychedelic. Not the best for newbies.

	If you truly experienced Awakening such silly ideas wouldn't even arise.
</p>

<p>
	You're stuck in the mind, over-thinking a thing which you have not yet experienced.

<p>
	The set of all even numbers is infinite, but it is a smaller infinity than the set of all decimals between 0 and 1, which is also infinite, but bigger! Infinity comes in orders of magnitude.

<p>
	A) Sustainability is your metric and bias. No one said you have to sustain it.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you cannot sustain a thing does not make it worthless. An orgasm is still worthwhile even if you can't have one 24/7.
</p>

<p>
	Your life itself will not be sustained. And yet you live it.
</p>

<p>
	God doesn't think any less of you if you cannot sustain Total Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	B) You have no idea what can or cannot be sustained until you try.
</p>

I think I will try the first doses vaping it to get acclimated to the experience and when I feel I know what it´s about I´ll plug it looking for a more total dose.

			There is infinite stages of awakening. Leo assuming that you can become fully awake at any point is a mistake in my opinion. Nobody ever will be fully awake at any point in time, only if they fully integrate the infinite realms of time, space all the dimensions and infinitely many other variants of everything at the same time to the deepest level you could say he is awake, but this is never going to be possible, because ever or never is within mind and within time. God is infinite and you are never going to be able to fully grasp that, you can fool yourself into thinking that you do of course. On the other hand of course you already are aware of all this and you are god obviously, but simply not in this realm, not in space and time, not in mind, because it's impossible to grasp infinity in these domains in a limited amount of time, you need eternity to grasp infinity and eternity is given to you, that's why there is an infinite amount of stages to climb and it never will end!
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Don't be so negative.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be amazed at what's possible.
</p>

<p>
	Since your true nature is Infinite, you can do a lot more than you think in 30 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Don't quit before you've even tried. You can always quit later. Why are people here so eager to quit??

<p>
	You don't need to do much to prepare yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Just start with small doses and slowly ramp up.
</p>

<p>
	The goal is not to become conscious in your first try. Your first try should be a baby dose just to see how it feels. Don't worry about how many tries it takes. I might take 10 tries. So what? It's more important to go gradually and fully integrate your insights. You don't want to freak yourself out too fast. Use psychedelics to gradually pry open your mind.
</p>

<p>
	GRADUALLY!

<p>
	Maybe, but at some point you become so conscious that you are omniscient. That's the goal. There are deeper and deeper levels of omniscience. But don't worry about that for now. Start by reaching a state of omniscience.
</p>

<p>
	There is a huge difference between not being omniscient at all (as you are now) vs being omniscient. It's a life-changing event.

	I've gone through about 100 different stages of Awakening at this point.
</p>

<p>
	And there's more.

<p>
	So get to work!

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Consciousness becomes more conscious of itself. The variable that deepens is consciousness! Since consciousness is all there is.
</p>

<p>
	God awakens to itself at higher and higher levels.
</p>

<p>
	When God is fully Awake, it has complete omniscience -- complete understanding of how it creates itself and what it is.
</p>

<p>
	If you ain't conscious of how you created your own mother, you ain't Awake.
</p>

<p>
	Real Awakening is a sort of self-understanding. You understand what everything is at ever more total levels. This is not a mental or intellectual knowledge. Your understanding is fused with the being of universe itself. Your understanding is what creates the walls of your house. The walls of your house are made out of pure Understanding/Consciousness.
</p>

	Nobody on this forum is Awake.
</p>

<p>
	Peter Ralston is not Awake. Rupert Spira is not Awake. Ekhart Tolle is not Awake. Sadhguru is not Awake. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Stop assuming these people are Awake. They are not. And neither are you.
</p>

<p>
	Real Awakening is beyond all that. And you will never ever reach it through meditation or self-inquiry.

			There is a group of hidden yogis in the himalayan region that seem genuine to me.

Also, they say that it's not really in our power to awaken.. if you're ready it will happen, if you're not, it won't happen no matter how many practices you try. You cannot force it (I guess you could force glimpses?). So I guess it truly is a question of how sincere your desire is, if you're ready to die. Only a minority is truly ready for that.

<p>
	Well, Sahaja Samadhi is supposedly well-documented to be possible.
</p>

<p>
	But that is far short of the peak you can hit on 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	So while Sahaja is clearly possible, beyond that I don't know.

<p>
	Yes, but you will not be able to sustain the peak. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
	Still worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than following some dogmatic plan, just explore and experiment. Who knows what you'll discover?

			Leo, however, If You dont mind, I have to clarify something that You are teaching. You are saying that when one is in his/her room, that room is the only thing that exist. But when we talk about dmt worlds and the dmt aliens, wouldn't that mean that there are other worlds/canvases like the dmt worlds with its own inhabitants which exist simultaneously, while one is in his/her room.

<p>
	The middle of Iraq is as wonderful and amazing and beautiful as the DMT realm.

<p>
	God HAS made this world the highest expression of consciousness and love.
</p>

<p>
	But you are not conscious enough to see it. Because you're stuck in the relative survival domain.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, your idea of "highest expression of love" is incorrect. God's idea of it correct. And it has been made actual.
</p>

<p>
	Love is a very counter-intuitive thing. You think it should be all rainbows and butterflies, but that's wrong! That's not the highest love. The highest love includes viruses and death and suffering. Why? Because the highest Love must even love viruses, death, and suffering! The highest Love must be unconditional.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is you hate viruses, death, and suffering. Because you are selfish. But God does not hate those things. Because God is selfless.
</p>

<p>
	Stop asking God to stoop down to your level. Instead, muster the courage to raise your perspective to God's level. So you can appreciate the Love.
</p>

You know. Just being in total contentment 24/7. And then all those insights and deepening of consciouness happen automatically. It just becomes sweeter and sweeter every day but you're not chasing it. You're just marinating in in all the time in full joy.

<p>
	Sure, that's a good thing. I'm not against that.
</p>

<p>
	But there is a trap there. If you quit seeking too early, if you become too satisified with yourself too early, you will not reach the highest level of God realization. There has to be a certain thirst for higher understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Most spiritual teachers today sell their students short. They don't give students a proper understanding of the depth of God realization possible. They only take their students half-way up the mountain. This is a great shame. Their students never realize what God truly is.

			But at the same time in other thread you told me, when I said that I don't agree that it is "loving" for God to give me illness, You said that it is because my POV is biased. And that from God's POV healing people or torturing a child is both Love. 
		</p>

		<p>
			However, here You write that harsh discipline doesn't feel loving for you, yet you expect me to accept that healing someone and torturing a child is both loving things.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You are confusing two different things.
</p>

<p>
	Of course harsh discipline is still Love in the absolute sense. I just said here that it's not how I choose to live my life.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become the more effortless and loving you'll want to live your life. For example, you'll have less desire to murder people. That doesn't mean murder isn't Love in the absolute sense. But if I'm choosing how to live my life, and I'm conscious about it, I will choose not to murder people. This doesn't change the fact that murder is still Love. But not-murdering is more in alignment with higher levels of consciousness. So if I see someone murdering another, I will totally understand it as Love. But that doesn't mean I will engage in the murder myself, or support it politically. Because I can still have a desire for a society where murder isn't common. That is how a higher consciousness being chooses to express its Love.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become, the more "godly" you will want to act. The more conscious I become, the less desire I have to force myself to do stuff. Effortlessness is a higher quality of God, even though all qualities are qualities of God.

<p>
	No, there's no mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, consciousness is so infinite that it gets fragmented and lost inside itself. Until one day it finds itself again. Until it loses itself again. Until it finds itself again.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is engaged in a never-ending process of self-exploration and being.
</p>

<p>
	You want to know what it's like to be a homeless crack whore? Go live one lifetime like that.
</p>

<p>
	You want to know what it's like to be a kangaroo? Go live one lifetime like that.
</p>

<p>
	And so on, forever.
</p>

<p>
	This is the only way you can truly come to know yourself. Since you are all things.
</p>

<p>
	It's not good enough for someone to tell you about it. You must live through it. Who could tell God about God when there's no one other than God? God can only learn about itself by exploring itself. God has no one to ask for help, or advice, or answers. God gets answers by experiencing itself.
</p>

<p>
	For God to know what an asshole is, it has to grow one and touch it and use it.
</p>

<p>
	I mostly practice do-nothing, unforcefully.
</p>

<p>
	But I'm also experimenting with improving my concentration, which I do very forcefully.

<p>
	I like to experiment with different things a lot. So I don't have one simple practice like many people.

<p>
	That's a tricky situation.
</p>

<p>
	If you're doing concentration practices, yes, those are forceful (at least in the beginning until you train it up a lot).
</p>

<p>
	But do-nothing is not forceful. Do-nothing is not concentration. Concentration is very much doing something.
</p>

<p>
	You could try doing both at different parts of the day. Have one forceful practice and one unforced one. See which works better for you.

<p>
	The fact is it's really hard to know how awake such ancient people were. There's 2000 years of dogma and mythology surrounding such figures. We don't have unbiased records of them. The records come from their students and devotees, which can't really be trusted.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	It can, but the whole point of do-nothing is that's supposed to be totally non-goal-oriented. You need to fully surrender and drop all expectation or desire for a result or a insight. If you're trying to gain an insight, you're not doing nothing, you're doing something.
</p>

<p>
	Do-nothing guarantees you no insight. But of course insights can arise spontaneously. You just have to accept that you won't get any for a while.
</p>

<p>
	With do-nothing you just sit, relax, and surrender all desire to manipulate your experience. And just be present. The key is surrender all tendencies to control your experience. And enjoy it. Relax! Drop all spiritual chasing or seeking. Drop the goal to become enlightened. At least during your sit. Trust that enlightenment will come to you.

<p>
	There is no higher entity than me. So to me channeling entities seems silly.
</p>

<p>
	If you want wisdom and advice, connect to God Consciousness and ask away. But be clear, you are talking to yourself. It can be very valuable. I channel insights from God frequently. I don't need some alien middle-man between me and God.

<p>
	I think a lot of people confuse liberation with God Awakening, and they are just not the same things at all.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, after experiencing God Awakening, I stopped caring about liberation. To me that's a spiritual game that Buddhists love to play. They are trying to act like The Buddha, which to me is not true Awakening. I do not purse Awakening to escape suffering or the world of form. I pursue self-understanding.

<p>
	It's gonna depend a lot on you. Whatever works for you.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I don't like practices where I have to force myself to do something. To me harsh discipline doesn't feel loving or right. I don't like that brutal Zen approach to spirituality. But some people do.
</p>

<p>
	These days I prefer effortless approaches. The danger with that is, you can get lazy with it. So I certainly see the value of discipline. But ultimately I want my life to be so smooth and effortless that I don't have to force myself to do anything. So that's what I'm working towards. If I have to discipline myself all the time, to me that isn't the highest level of being. Life should be effortless.

	As unbelievable as this sounds, I have reached levels of Awakening which clearly show me that no nonduality teacher is fully awake.
</p>

<p>
	But I don't expect you guys to believe me.

			For example, I’ve given a few people direct experiences of Oneness with Absolute Infinity. Would you say it’s Ethan who’s unawake (for giving it) or the people he’s giving it to?

<p>
	Okay, so you've given them some degree of awakeness. But it's gonna be a very mild degree.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying you shouldn't do that. It could be very helpful. I'm just saying there are higher levels.

			What does this mean for free will? Since God has infinite intelligence and total omniscience, does God ‘know’ about the bread crumbs and precisely how it will lead the ego-mind to its self-realization?

<p>
	God knows when you know, and not until then, since God is you.
</p>

<p>
	Do you know why and how you created yourself? No? Then God isn't awake to itself.

<p>
	LOL
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is beyond any such silly dualities as masculine and feminine. It is Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	I am not masculine, I am not feminine. I am Infinity.
