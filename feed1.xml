			That would be nice.

		<p>
			Ok I can try to trust you. Although you are not enlightened I think..
		</p>

		<p>
			I assume consciousness/awareness is also included in the list.
		</p>

		<p>
			Moojis comment to your reply would be: "What sees the experience? Even that experience is seen."
		</p>

		<p>
			He say that no matter how nice the experience is, it's not "it". There's always someone/something which sees the seer.
		</p>

		<p>
			What's your take on that..?
		</p>

		<p>
			Or maybe I have misunderstood something. Maybe Mooji say that to push people towards the "thing" you mentioned, so people don't stop too early. And that would be the end station so to speak, final destination.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, consciousness is Nothingness. Which is why you can't grasp hold of it.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is not an experience. It is Absolute and Mooji don't matter at that point. You are Mooji talking to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Mooji was pointing you to Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	I am not enlightned but I have seen the Absolute many times at this point from a variety of angles, deeper than some teachers.
</p>

<p>
	I have seen the Heart Sutra's truth for myself, and it is true as fuck. Realizing the Heart Sutra is what you want.

</p>

<p>
	The Heart Sutra says it perfectly.
</p>

<p>
	The only trouble is becoming so insanely conscious to see it.
</p>

<p>
	It's right there under your nose. Don't go looking elsewhere. You are inside Nothingness at all times.

<p>
	How could everything be distinct from nothing? Nothing is nothing, so there is nothing to keep it from fusing with everything.
</p>

<p>
	No, I have not redefined the word. I am trying to show you that the distinction between something and nothing is in fact relative.
</p>

<p>
	The universe actually cannot tell the difference between something and nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse this for word games. Something extemely profound is being pointed at here.

</blockquote>

<p>
	How could it not if nothing is the same as something?
</p>

<p>
	You are assuming nothing and something are distinct. This is a mistake.
</p>

<p>
	You are writing this because nothing in the universe has ever happened. So everything happened. So here you are.

<p>
	Without a distinction between something and nothing you'd be dead. So it's very difficult for you to see that something is nothing as that would collapse reality and derail your entire life.

			I don't know why you guys enjoy saying "everything is nothing", because that's not true.
		</p>

		<p>
			But I guess it depends on the definition of "nothing", for me the definition of nothing is really really really nothing. And I think that's the correct definition. So it's wrong to say that everything is nothing.
		</p>

		<p>
			I think you guys are just bending the word 'nothing'. What's the point with that? Is the point that it's a cool thing to say "everything is nothing" and "you are nothing"?
		</p>

		<p>
			You change the word 'nothing' to a half-assed 'nothing'. Let the word mean really really really nothing instead of half-assed nothing.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, you are not hearing what is being said.
</p>

<p>
	These are not word games. Nothing actually is identical to everything.
</p>

<p>
	Do not expect to understand this using your rational linear mind. This requires a deep enlightenment to grasp. We talking about the ultimate structure of all of existence here! Don't except this to be easy or logical.
</p>

<p>
	All your ideas of nothing are not nothing.
</p>

<p>
	The closest you can get to nothing is by looking around the room. That is actual nothing.
</p>

<p>
	---------
</p>

<p>
	Just trust my guidance on this one guys. Otherwise you will waste years looking in the wrong direction.
</p>

<p>
	I am pointing you straight at nothing. But it's extremely radically and the mind doesn't want to see it.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic to speed up the realization. This one's a doozy and will take you 20 years to realize sober.

<p>
	Something didn't emerge out of nothing. Rather, something and nothing are identical and indistinguishable.
</p>

<p>
	0 vs 1 is a distinction or a difference you're latching onto.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possibility that there is no difference between 0 and 1. Or in other words, there is only a difference between 0 and 1 if you say that there is, otherwise there isn't.
</p>

<p>
	Pause, look around the room, and notice that everything you see is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire life has been nothing, only you had mistaken it for something.
</p>

<p>
	All this time your mistake has been thinking that everything around you is something when it is in fact nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing looks precisely like the "physical universe". Nothing is NOT an empty hole like you have always imagined.

<p>
	Bring God into your own life first, then you will understand.
</p>

<p>
	There is no greater source of evil in the world than those who try to bring God into the lives of others without first succeeding in bringing God into their own life.
</p>

<p>
	God unrealized is the devil.

<p>
	"Physical" itself is a hollow, relative term. Really contemplate: What does "physical" even mean?
</p>

<p>
	Physical vs non-physical is a conceptual distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Even real vs unreal is a conceptual distinction.
</p>

<p>
	All distinctions are relative, and not the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	But it gets even weirder!
</p>

<p>
	Even the distinction between relative vs absolute is itself a conceptual distinction! Such that there can be no difference between something and nothing, form and formlessness, reality and illusion, enlightenment and non-enlightenment.

<p>
	This shows that you do NOT know what "ALL THERE IS" really means.
</p>

<p>
	ALL THERE IS....
</p>

<p>
	Think about that. That's everything!
</p>

<p>
	So what the hell are you talking about? What is more than ALL?
</p>

<p>
	ALL is an absolute. "More" is a relative term which does not apply to the ALL.
</p>

<p>
	ALL includes all other realities already.
</p>

<p>
	If you can think of something beyond the ALL, then your notion of the ALL wasn't actually the ALL.

	Tone is the least of JP problems.
</p>

<p>
	The deep structural issue is that he is programming his fans with stage Blue mentality, against Green. It stifles movement up the Spiral, which is what's necessary for people to find God. So he's shooting his own fans in the foot.

	If someone hits a castle made out of Legos with a hammer, the castle will break. So will your sense of self & life.
</p>

<p>
	What remains is no-self.
</p>

<p>
	You only exist as an idea. This idea will die and all that will remain is the universe.
</p>

<p>
	With a broken brain, you will not longer to able to say or think, "This is my life". And thus "you" will cease to exist as an ego. Sights, sounds, and feelings could still arise, but there would be nothing claiming ownership of them.
</p>

<p>
	No-self = True Self
</p>

<p>
	Where you go is, you die.
</p>

<p>
	You only exist now as an idea.
</p>

Consciousness is the only thing that you've ever encountered or can encounter. The rest is a conceptual framework you've invented within your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	"Physical objects" is a concept within consciousness. Take a look at what that really is.
</p>

<p>
	"But maybe there is still the possibility that reality can be physical" << that's a concept within consciousness!
</p>

<p>
	To discover that the materialist paradigm is wrong you must closely examine what "physical", "material", and "matter" really are in your direct experience. You must discover that they are concepts.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics also help a lot in this deconstruction.
</p>

<p>
	None of this is a matter of belief. You must sit down and ACTUALLY look at what is real in your direct experience. This is called contemplation or self-inquiry. The answers are inside you, if you would just bother to look. Don't look for arguments, look at what is ACTUALLY the case in your direct experience.
</p>

	Everything is an illusion of course and nothing has any meaning already.
</p>

<p>
	The universe will never end though, it will just turn into a unity and fragment back into infinite multiplicity.
</p>

<p>
	Fun idea to contemplate: the beginning of the Big Bang and the end, heat death, are actually identical because you cannot distinguish them.
</p>

<p>
	Space and time are illusory human inventions. You can become conscious that they don't actually exist.

</p>

<p>
	God is precisely not a map or a meaning.
</p>

<p>
	Peterson's work is what keeps him from discovering God.
</p>

<p>
	His intuition is right that God is worth seeking. But he does not understand how to realize God because he's stuck in orthodox Christian notions of God, which are extremely misleading.
</p>

<p>
	And then his silly politics stems from that.

	Sit down and have an honest conversation with her about your intentions towards her. Tell her you like her a lot, but that you don't feel she's "the one". You can suggest that you could still keep seeing each other, if she still wants. But now she will know how you feel and she will have more realistic expectations.
</p>

<p>
	It will be heartbreaking for her, but it will better than stringing her along. And ultimately she should understand.
</p>

<p>
	The key thing is that you aren't leading her on with false expectations.

<p>
	Having sex outdoors in public is pretty hard and scary. Not to mention if this is your first time ever having sex.
</p>

<p>
	You should be much more comfortable in a secure indoor environment where you will not be interrupted or have to rush.
</p>

<p>
	Logistics, logistics, logistics. 70% of getting laid is planning out the night properly so that you two end up alone in a secure location.
</p>

<p>
	Also, do not get overly sexual with a girl unless you are ALREADY in a secure location. You must close the deal, otherwise she will often get too creeped out by the situation and not give you another shot. It's too awkward to get naked with someone but not have sex. And girls hate that kind of awkwardness.
</p>

<p>
	Next time, make sure you close. You, as the man, are responsible for planning things such that you can close.
</p>

You can find such people on online pickup forums.
</p>

<p>
	Approaching is one of those things which feels very difficult at first, but is actually a lot easier than your mind makes it out to be.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to learn to approach solo. It helps a lot to a few seasoned wing-men.
</p>

<p>
	You also need to find the right locations to do your approaching (mall, nightclub, cafe, etc). Some locations are much better than others.

	Yes, but he also drank quite a bit of ayahausca.
</p>

<p>
	I've discussed this issue with him in private at length. His consciousness of nonduality seems legit. As in: permanent nondual awareness.
</p>

<p>
	But he admits, and I agree, that his awakening was rather unusual and unique to him. Not a typical result.

<p>
	P.S. If you work on making yourself a great man, she will never want to leave you. In fact, being less possessive of her will make her love you more.
</p>

<p>
	It's like reverse psychology.
</p>

<p>
	If you are a weak man who isn't working on improving himself, then yes, she might leave you from something more exciting.
</p>

<p>
	She doesn't really want another girl, she wants more passion, excitement, adventure. So give her more of that. You want that too.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of a relationship is to grow and explore together. That's what keeps it from getting stale.

<p>
	You can learn all the techniques and psychology behind attraction and relationships. That is not a problem. In fact, it's very important and women will ultimately appreciate it.
</p>

<p>
	The problem arises when you start to turn all of that into an ideology and identity, the way PUA culture does. Don't become that alpha-bro manwhore who runs around chasing women all the time and bragging about it.
</p>

<p>
	Attract women, but above all, be a good kind man. Don't become a manipulative used dick salesmen. Learn to develop deep relationships with those women you attract. Don't do it for the sex or the ego, do it for the growth opportunities.

<p>
	This is just the nature of online forums.
</p>

<p>
	98% of forum posts are supposed to be nonsense. The other 2% are the gold which makes wading through the 98% worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
	You just have to adjust your expectations for what forums are. A public forum is not an encyclopedia. If you want that, you got Wikipedia (which is awesome by the way).

</blockquote>

<p>
	Everything is a hallucination at all times.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can delude yourself into believing all sorts of things using any kind of methods, so it's a rather moot point.
</p>

<p>
	It would be a delusion to assume that psychedelics increase your chances of delusion. You are at max delusion "sober". But, yes, you can still be deluded under psychedelics.

			I have the same problem, and I cannot wrap my mind around it either.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's assume the materialist position, that an outside world exists and that a brain is generating consciousness:
		</p>

		<p>
			If that is true, every idea I have, every impression of reality I have, is nothing but an illusion created by the brain. Though the problem here is that this illusion includes all impressions and ideas of the brain I have as well! Everything I believe about reality is nothing but a belief, that is the very problem! If I believe that a brain exists, what exactly is happening? I have a thought of a brain, and that thought included that the thought of the brain is created by the brain. That means the thought of the brain cannot be the brain, no matter what thought I will have! Your mind should be absolutely blown at this point, but let's continue. If my thought about the brain is not the brain itself then what the hell is the brain? Any thought I will ever have about the brain can impossibly be the brain. By definition the brain is creating the ideas, so how could the ideas be the same as the brain?
		</p>

		<p>
			It gets even worse! The brain is made of atoms, but atoms are nothing but an idea in my head as well! If atoms are what is creating my experience, then clearly the idea of atoms that I have are not the atoms, because the atoms are what is generating the idea! What is going on?!
		</p>

		<p>
			It goes further:
		</p>

		<p>
			Every idea I have about anything is happening in my consciousness, right? It's also true that any experience I have at all is happening in my consciousness as well! But my ideas about consciousness and experiences itself are experiences and ideas themselves! They clearly are not consciousness, but how is it possible that I can even have a thought about consciousness? Why can I think about anything, and what does thinking about anything even mean?
		</p>

		<p>
			At this point I am utterly confused. It seems like it's the limit of the mind, but the problem is that the limit of the mind is just another idea in the mind! This goes on and on!
		</p>

		<p>
			It's like I am generating a fatal error in my own programming. Can you see it too?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes! Very good!
</p>

<p>
	What you are starting to catch onto there is that everything you call reality is a conceptual fabrication. If you keep questioning deeper you will evetually realize that "physical reality" itself is just an idea, "my birth" is also just an idea, "my life" is also just an idea, "other people" is also just an idea. At which point reality will collapse and you die. That is awakening.
</p>

<p>
	After you peel back every layer of the onion what you will discover at the very center is Emptiness. That's the True Self.
</p>

			Perhaps, although what I think I am saying is that you are also within the drean using a substance that is a also in the dream (and therefore by your logic cannot be true).  Basically from within the dream you think you exited the dream but you have not.  btw other people have taken 5MEO and reported back on this very site with different experiences from yours.  So who's right?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The difference is I have ACTUALLY exited the dream and become the Absolute. You have not. So you are wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this may seem arrogant to you, but nevertheless, it is true. And there is no way you will know if I am right until you yourself awaken. At which point you will clearly know the Absolute Truth, but you will be unable to communicate it to anyone else, and you find yourself precisely in my shoes, trying to explain awakening to the unawakened, who just cannot get it because they deeply underestimate what reality is.

<p>
	All knowledge is non-trivial, involving serious risk and investment of resources. Which is why science takes hundreds of years to make progress, with many dead ends.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why you must choose how you invest your time very very wisely.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately you seem to lack that wisdom, which is a rather problematic catch-22.
</p>

<p>
	How do you convince a thirsty donkey to drink water if he keeps insisting the water is poison?
</p>

<p>
	And so the donkey, thinking he has avoided a great danger, will end up dying of thirst.

<p>
	No, you are making this false evaluation from inside the dream.

<p>
	I am speaking to you of truths which lie outside the dream which you cannot fathom because you have never exited the dream.

<p>
	Any ideas you have about 5-MeO are wrong. It's just that simple.

<p>
	You cannot outthink awakening.

<p>
	You are still not grasping that anything your mind thinks is untrue.

<p>
	And you never will. That's the point.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	You cannot speculate about spirituality. You must do the practices, whether than be 5-MeO or yoga or meditation, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to overcome a lack of direct experience with thinking. You see that?

<p>
	You keep making your misuse of skepticism about me. This issue has nothing to do with yoga or with me. It has to do with how you are misusing your mind, and then expecting others to prove things to you. This not how to seek truth.
</p>

<p>
	Leave Leo out of the conversation. Leo should not even enter your mind as you go about seeking truth. What I believe is totally irrelevant. What matters is that you start to contemplate and self-reflect about your own behaviors and beliefs.

<p>
	You were given a far deeper lesson here. You were shown the limits of the Orange paradigm, but you insist on continuing to see the world from that level.
</p>

<p>
	You are being taught to open your mind.
</p>

<p>
	When you finally open your mind, you will stop demanding that people prove anything to you.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that your entire attitude is anti-scientific. True science is not about demanding proofs from people. True science is about openminded experimentation.

<p>
	It's very important to figure out how you are going to offer value to the world.
</p>

<p>
	Your mistake is thinking of this as "work" or "making money". That's super shallow. You need to think of it as: "What is my art? What do I want to contribute to mankind?" The money follows from your passion.
</p>

<p>
	You will have to make a living in the world no matter what, so might as well do it on your terms.
</p>

<p>
	I make a living by doing what I love most. This was by deep design, not luck.

<title>How exactly does 5-MEO contradict the Materialist Pradigm?</title>

<p>
	You are inside a dream. All of your ideas about reality are fantasies inside this dream. Science and reason are fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Every objection or thought you have is fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Anything you type on that keyboard is fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Any ideas you have about 5-MeO are fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot escape this dream by thinking. Nor can you imagine what lies outside the dream.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO takes you out of the dream. You will not understand how it is possible, but it is.
</p>

<p>
	See video: True vs False Skepticism
</p>

<p>
	You so called "skeptics" are simply letting ego weaponize skepticism.
</p>

<p>
	Skepticism is great when done right. But in the hands of a fool, skepticism turns into an ideology and leads to stupidities like Flat Earthers, scientism, materialism, atheism, reductionism, behaviorism, logical positivism, rationalism, libertarianism, etc. Which is what is happening in this thread.
</p>

<p>
	Apply skepticism internally, to yourself, not externally at other people.
</p>

<p>
	Self-deception 101.
</p>

<p>
	You have been told precisely the fallacy in your approach, but you refuse to hear it.
</p>

<p>
	A person stuck in stage Orange will not be able to do yoga. The mind is just too locked into the materialist paradigm. Your level of development is too low. Try doing more ordinary self help for a few years. Then revisit the issue.
</p>

<p>
	Very few people are ready to learn what Actualized.org videos are teaching. This is not some shallow Jordan Peterson or Tony Robbins self-improvement. We are talking about the deconstruction of physical reality here. And your mind will not allow you to do that easily. You will have to work through many layers of self-deception mechanisims first. Of which skepticism is but one.
</p>

<p>
	Drop the need to have shit proven to you. That is a need of a weak and juvenile mind.

<p>
	By your stupid logic no science could ever be done. Because proof only comes AFTER the expeirements are run. Never before.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't want to take the risk of running an experiment and having it fail, then you're stuck. No science for you. No progress for you. You are just another sheep.
</p>

<p>
	No one is asking you to believe anything. You are being told to run a serious experiment.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga is an extremely advanced spiritual practice. It is not for closedminded stage Orange fools.
</p>

<p>
	I warned you from the very beginning: RADICAL OPENMINDEDNESS!

<p>
	Without consumerism, how would you get your food, clothes, electronics?
</p>

<p>
	Notice that Green depends on Orange foundations.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how you yourself had to grow through Orange. So how can you judge others for doing the same? It would be like judging a child for not being an adult.

<p>
	Yes and no.
</p>

<p>
	You can have multiple enlightenments, each one going deeper.
</p>

<p>
	It's a complex topic. There many facets of reality to become conscious of even though all of those facets ultimately unite into one. It's like you are groping an elephant in a dark room. You're groping it piece by piece. Then sometimes the lights turn on in the whole room for 1 second and you glimpse the entire thing. But it's still worthwhile to go back and grope the tail or the ear individually because there's a lot of nuance in each piece which you didn't get during that 1 second glimpse.
</p>

<p>
	And after lots of doing that, maybe at some point you will get to a stage where you can clearly see the whole elephant in its full glory.
</p>

<p>
	Just watch out for bears. I once had a bear try to sneak up on us in the woods while tripping.

<p>

<p>
	When I write Truth with a capital T, that is refering to the absolute. Relative truth I write with a lowercase t.

Nothing IS Absolute Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is a self-negating self-negation.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is a happening which never actually happened.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	God is that.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to figure this out using the mind. It will not work. It is profoundly paradoxically. The mind cannot handle it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics and/or yoga is the way to go about realizing this.

That's exactly correct. All experiences are in fact eternal. They have existed FOREVER. This very sentence you are reading has existed within Absolute Infinity for eternity. The mind is just overlooking this oh-so-obvious fact.
</p>

<p>
	Right now, look around the room you're in. You are looking at eternity in the flesh.

Say if you became hella enlightened right now(like for example Eckhart Tolle) how important would it be to do personal development? I feel like you would grow hugely from the enlightenment. And then the need for books wouldn’t really be a thing? Is studying personal development literature important?(say standard self help like tony Robbins, or maybe some sort of stage green or yellow self help?) or would you not need that since you are beyond all that? You have outgrown it all after you integrated the enlightenment? Maybe you have gone up to turqoise within a couple years? What is the importance of literature on personal development when you have a radical enlightenment? I’m just trying to get a big picture here.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It would still be important. Of course having a massive enlightenment will itself produce a huge shift in your development. But that will not be enough by itself. There will still be many things which you are unconscious of and many ways to improve your life. Your bad habits and shadow side will still largely remain unaddressed. You will still lack important skills and knowledge for succeeding in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment will not automatically put you at Turquoise. Turquoise requires additional work. Being a good human being also requires additional work. Fully embodying your enlightenment requires additional work. Becoming a good teacher requires additional work. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	And having one complete massive life-shattering enlightened is extremely rare. Chances are high you will fall back asleep after your first glimpse, or have some kind of ego-backlash.

<p>
	Kriya yoga & psychedelics will get you there much faster.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, consciousness is basically the same as hyper-lucidity. You become so lucid you realize there is no difference between difference and sameness. You become conscious that the metaphysical distinctions underlying your entire sense of reality are all meaningless: self vs world, life vs death, real vs unreal, something vs nothing. All of these distinctions collapse and you are left in pure nonduality. Reality becomes indistinct. Your identity collapses to zero and expands to infinity simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
	At this level of lucidity, life as you know it is over. You have awoken from "life". You realize that your entire "life" was just a dream. You have died and awoken to realize that death is impossible because you are God. You are suspended in an infinite eternal state of Nirvana. You have achieved actual immortality. You realize that your true identity is an infinity singularity, which includes inside it every living creature that has ever existed or will exist. You are so lucid that you have 100% omniscient understanding of all of reality. You realize that you have created yourself using infinite intelligence and that nothing exists but yourself.
</p>

<p>
	This degree of consciousness cannot be imagined or believed. It is extremely radical. It defies all scientific or rational explanation.
</p>

<p>
	Real vs unreal is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality = all distinctions collapse into a unity. At this ultimate, Absolute level of consciousness, there is literally no difference between anything. There is not even a difference between real and unreal.
</p>

<p>
	Practically, you should make a distinction in your mind between level of consciousness vs level of development.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment work is about raising your level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Personal development is about raising your level of development and changing your life around.
</p>

<p>
	Both are very important.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity has no opposite. It is total. It already includes an infinite number of other realities.
</p>

<p>
	There is no "more" than Absolute Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Like so:

</div>

<p>
	Anything you can think of (and everything you can't) is already accounted for by Absolute Infinity.

<p>
	If this was strictly true, no human being could ever have become enlightened ever.
</p>

<p>
	But your point is valid practically-speaking for the vast majority of seekers.
</p>

<p>
	Hardcore seekers can accomplish enlightenment without any tutelage or theory. But if you are on this forum or watching my videos, that ain't you.

<p>
	That video is a nice attempt, but that approach will always fail.
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to have a scientific theory of everything because a theory is precisely not everything, and neither is science.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not a code or a language or an equation or a model of any kind.
</p>

<p>
	The only proper theory of everything is: Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	But that's not a theory. That's actual everything (and nothing) <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Any attempt to capture the Truth in symbols will always fail. The Truth cannot fit into any kind of box because the box itself is an infinitely small part of the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	What science is trying to do can only be achieved through spirituality. And it was already achieved 5000 years ago. The problem is, people still don't get it.

Some people are more heart-centered, some people are more intellectual. I am pretty intellectual so I love asking questions and exploring how the mind works. I can see that some people will not like that approach to spirituality.

</p>

<p>
	What I find works best for me is to do lots of questioning in my everyday life, long before the trip starts. Then when I trip I don't really demand any answers or even set much of an intention, the answers will just naturally flow to me because I have been so curiously asking questions for the last month or two.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you are genuinely curious about, you will likely get answered.
</p>

	In my experience the universe rewards pearl-connoisseurs.

<p>
	In the ultimate end, yes. But that's a long ways to go for most people. It is important not to be in too big of a rush to reach that ultimate place because there are lessons which will be missed along the way.
</p>

<p>
	As an analogy, the ultimate end of going to school is that you will exit school. But it would be a big mistake to exist school in 3rd grade or to tell people "Stop going to school because the end-goal is no-school". You gotta exit it by passing through all the grades. Then you will be truly free.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually you will transcend all questions and answers, and just be. But to get there, you will have to start asking some deep questions and seeking some deep answers.
</p>

Which greatly overestimates the abilities of ordinary folk.
</p>

<p>
	From an enlightened-master's POV, his consciousness does not seem super-human to him. But from the ordinary folks POV, it is.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics make this very clear because they expand consciousness so dramatically in such a short period of time, and then drop you back down just as fast. Which creates a great sense of the degrees that consciousness comes in.
</p>

<p>
	By doing years of slow, gradual meditation work, people can easily forget just how unconscious they used to be and just how much they've grown.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I often catch myself taking my last 5 years of growth for granted. Sorta just assuming that all people are like me, and that even I was like me 5 years ago. But this is an illusion. I've grown enormously. It's just become my new normal to the point where its hard to even remember how unconscious I used to be.
</p>

<p>
	The average person is nowhere close to being able to see infinity. I still struggle seeing it sober even though intellectually I know I'm smack dab inside it all the time.
</p>

<p>
	Not quite. To become conscious of:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What am I?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is another?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is love?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is existence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is consciousness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is language?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is a distinction?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is intelligence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is ego?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is suffering?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is happiness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is a thought?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is emotion?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This is the essence of enlightenment work. And all of those are metaphysical questions. And they certainly CAN be answered (not necessarily verbally or intellectually).
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem for most people is that they don't take such questions seriously. They are not genuinely curious about them. They do not seriously wonder. Which is why I shoot videos like What Is Consciousness, Understanding Absolute Infinity, What Is Intelligence, etc. Those videos are my attempts to get people to start wondering about these questions.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is purely a metaphysical pursuit. Just not in an intellectual or belief-based way. True metaphysical understanding comes through expanded consciousness, mindfulness, holistic thinking, and hyper-intuition.
</p>

<p>
	That Buddha quote is being misapplied here. When we talk about metaphysics, we are not talking about petty questions like whether the bow string is made of of fiber or bamboo thread. Just the opposite. To wonder about any of the questions I listed above is to leave aside all the petty human questions related to survival and to follow the path of the Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha was a metaphysician of the highest order.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, it's very important that you avoid idle speculation on the above questions or grand theory-building. Your contemplation must be grounded in direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	It does no good to sit around speculating about what God is. You must seek God directly in your experience.
</p>

<p>
	And all of these questions become super-important inside psychedelic trips. They are like keys that unlock the various doors of divine wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	The answers to the above questions are the MOST relevant to your liberation and happiness.
</p>

<title>Developing the &quot;REAL&quot; doing nothing technique</title>

So you just sit there and every time you notice an attempt to manipulate your experience arise, you let it go. And you keep doing this over and over again until you are completely surrendered to just the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	Surrender all techniques, surrender all desire to manipulate thoughts or change your experience in any way.
</p>

<p>
	It's a wonderful method. But sometimes it also produces lots of monkey mind because you're letting go of all control. This is normal. The monkey mind will eventually subside.
</p>

<p>
	But Kriya yoga is still far superior.
</p>

<p>
	Do nothing becomes amazing after a few months/years of Kriya yoga.
</p>

<p>
	On that point he is wrong.
</p>

<p>
	He hasn't become fully conscious of infinity because his physics background is in the way.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is actual Infinity. In fact, that's the only thing that exists: infinity. Every other object is just a consequence of infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is infinite both as a whole and as every part of the whole. Infinity contains within it an infinite number of infinities.
</p>

<p>
	This requires a radical, super-human level of consciousness to realize so it's not surprising that very few people realize it. Even those people who are into spirituality, meditation, and nonduality rarely reach Infinity.

<p>
	Next time you trip, put away all distractions. No taking notes, no computers, no smart phones, no reading.
</p>

<p>
	Recording and documenting your trip interferes with you fully diving into it.
</p>

<p>
	And don't think so much. All that thinking is getting in the way. Just go on the ride. Drop the expectations like, "Leo told me this will be profound, but it isn't. What is wrong?" That's all a distraction.

<p>
	What you believe is false.
</p>

<p>
	If Truth would only be present in deep sleep, it would not be Truth, it would be contingent. The whole point of Truth is that it's ALWAYS the case.
</p>

<p>
	Stop arguing and open your mind to the guidance being given you. This is not a point of debate or uncertainty. You are simply mistaken.

	This is the essence of nonduality. All distinctions collapse such that everything becomes Nothingness. Nothingness is NOT a blank void. Nothingness is precisely everything you see around you.

	You are holding Nothing as distinct from Something. Which is a duality. When that duality finally collapses, you will realize, "Oh shit! Everything was Nothing the whole time! There is no difference between existence and non-existence, life and death, reality and fantasy."

	Channeling is a very common phenomenon. You can learn to do it yourself.
</p>
