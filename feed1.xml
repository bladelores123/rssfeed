<p>
	Calling it presence is extremely deceptive though.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone thinks they have presence so they don't think they're missing anything.
</p>

<p>
	Whereas with God, it's clear to most people that they are missing an experience of God.
</p>

<p>
	Take someone like Sam Harris. He has meditated for years, he even has some degree of awakening to no-self, and he would readily agree with you about presence, but he is not conscious of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	Presence or awareness are way too neutral of terms. These terms actually make many Buddhists believe there is no God.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	The answer is to tread carefully and not build cult-like organizational structures and to stress an integral, dogma-free approach.
</p>

<p>
	The answer is also to not get ahead of your skiis, to maintain high personal integrity and to not lust after power, sex, money, fame, or success.
</p>

<p>
	The answer is to do shadow work even after awakening and to be sensitive to the collateral damage you cause. And to not go on a crusade.

<title>Laws of Infinity/God and free will?</title>

Just look at the yin-yang image. It's both nondual and dual at the same times because it depends on how you want to look at it.
</p>

<p>
	Free will vs not-free-will is a duality which collapses when you're in nondual consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can tap into the infinite creativity of God, since you are him. But that does not necessary mean you can create mountains out of thin air.

<title>mixing Vippassana and Self Inquiry</title>

</p>

<p>
	I had my first mystical experience doing just that: Vipassana followed by self-inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	I find self-inquiry not to be effective unless one's mind is already in the zone and highly mindful. So, for example, I find it bad practice to being a meditation retreat with self-inquiry because the mind is not focused enough yet to have any breakthrough. So my retreats begin with lots of Vipassana. The self-inquiry is best saved towards the end.
</p>

<p>
	Vipassana is sorta like sharping the knife and self-inquiry is more like using it to slit the throat. Without Vipassana you've got a butter knife.
</p>

<title>Will girls not have sex outside of a relationship in hgihschool?</title>

<p>
	A "relationship" in high school is a rather fickle notion. More like a 2-week affair.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you're not gonna be doing one-night stands or same night lays in high school. You gotta build up to it through friendship in a way that you wouldn't need to do if you're hunting for girls at a bar or club.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see why you'd even want that in high school. Just get yourself a girlfriend. You don't need to sleep around with your entire class. If you're gonna be having sex with a girl in high school your intent should be to be in a relationship with her. Why you making it such a big chore? Relationships are fun. A relationship (in high school) is not marriage. It's a flimsy thing.

</p>

<p>
	So if you're really serious about it, start by building your spiritual experience.

<p>
	Enlightenment will not even come close to eradicating all issues.
</p>

<p>
	You are already well on your way to developing a massive enlightened shadow.
</p>

<p>
	An entire book could be written on post-enlightenment shadow issues and pathologies.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This is a very dangerous misconception. By equating enlightenment with moral perfection and an impossiblity of shadow, you set yourself up to be a great Zen Devil, full of much shadow. Because once your enlightenment happens, you'll still have a TON of shadow issues left unresolved, but your fantasy of perfection will force you to deny this fact and so you will suppress these shadow issues even deeper, doubling the size of your shadow and become a half-enlightened devil.
</p>

<p>
	Even the greatest most enlightened masters have shadows and pathologies.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be a fool. Nothing in this work is automatic.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea what imperfections Ramana Maharshi had. You just have a fantasy of him in your mind. It's easy to appear to have no imperfections when living one's entire life in a cave. The real test comes when you live an active life, where you have leadership obligations, duties, money, fame, sex, luxury, family, children, business, politics, and other things to deal with. When a hot girl with big tits comes and rubs them on you, let's see how long your enlightenment lasts.

But Orange is dangerous enough as it is. And when those 60% Blue evolve into Orange, that will be a big problem as Orange will run hog-wild. That could easily end humanity.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if all of Africa, South America, Middle East, and Asia became Orange! That's pretty scary. And you know it's coming unless we kill ourselves even sooner.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I'm not worried about Green. We need a thousand times more Green to balance out all the Orange that's yet to come.

<p>
	It is precisely what it wants to be.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality requires nothing outside itself to define it. It exists without non-existence. It is light without dark. Nonduality has no opposite.
</p>

<p>
	You are still thinking of nonduality dualistically.

</p>

<p>
	If life is suffering, what is it when you are not suffering?
</p>

<p>
	Are you suffering right this moment?
</p>

<p>
	Yet the moment still is.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to over-generalize and call everything suffering. That chair is not suffering, for example.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that there are many times throughout the day when you are not suffering. Which shows you that your perspective is not totally right.

	60%+ of the world population is at Blue or below. So I'd be more worried about that and Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Much of Green radicalism is actually a reaction against the stubbornness of Orange from evolving into Green.
</p>

<p>
	If Orange took environmental issues and income inequality seriously, then there would be much less incentive for Green radicals.

<title>Confusion about god and infinity</title>

<p>
	Infinity does not necessarily work the way your mind imagines.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is infinitely intelligent because it has unlimited power. In short, there is nothing to stop from being infinitely intelligent, so it is!
</p>

<p>
	What you must understand is that there are no constraints on reality as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not random, arbitrary, or chaotic. It is fine-tuned by an infinite intellect which cannot ever be fully articulated, but you can become conscious that this is so.
</p>

	If you were me, you'd be sitting here typing this sentence with no sense of being you. Since to be me is to be fully me, not you.
</p>

<p>
	What it means to be you is to not see through anyone else's eyes but your own.
</p>

<p>
	If you were able to see through my eyes, you'd be me! Which is precisely what I am: you looking through my eyes! And you are me looking through your eyes.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	This is possible precisely because the perceiver (True Self) is nothing.

	Or he builds a cult which goes off the rails and drives many people into delusion.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to take into account about every organization is how it plays out after the leader is dead. How much evil will it spread? If the leader enlightens 1000 people in his lifetime but leaves an organization which enslaves and brainwashes 100,000, it's not longer clear that it was a net positive.
</p>

<p>
	Is the Catholic church a net positive or net negative? Hard to say. The math is very complex in that equation. Jesus might be rolling in his grave.

Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Mahavira, Muhammad, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's no accident that such people are revered as gods among men. And serve a role models for millions. Because to truly pull off such a thing requires you become god-like.
</p>

<p>
	In practice no leader is perfect. Many of them have secret hidden shadow sides which you don't see in public.
</p>

<p>
	For example Gandhi was an amazing leader but not without some personal shadow issues. Same with Martin Luther King Jr.
</p>

<p>
	Also take note how many of these leaders were killed by the ignorant hoards. That should tell you something.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I find Gandhi very inspiring. He gave up his whole life for his mission.

If thats it then also those old Tibetan Monks or anyone/anything from past history, which we have not seen, did probably not exist and is only made up from this dream?
		</p>

		<p>
			Because if they existed, then this dream has been going on for millions of years continously having experienced so many different lifeforms since the first cell, and that would not be meaningless then and also if it has been going on for millions of years then probably we experience this dream againn in another ego and that is there comes up the question in what ego and where on this planet are we going to experience it again?
		</p>

		<p>
			And if there are infinite amount of other dreams, then what determines in which one our special feeling ego is going to appear again, which factors? There is no ego? But there must be because I am experiencing one, what happens after death is mysterious, hopefully I'll find out having a beautiful 5 Meo DMT experience too, but for now I am curious and hope this sparks a healthy conversation here

<p>
	This is too deep a topic to get into here. If you want to discuss that, start a new thread about it.
</p>

<p>
	For now what I'll say it this: you can spend decades reading various scriptures and various claims by monks and yogis. But all of it will be hearsay and you will have no clue if what they are saying is true or not. You must ground this work in your own direct experience. Are there aliens? Are there past lives? Is there karma? Is there an escape from rebirth? Is there a God? Are there angels? -- the truth is you don't know until such time you are directly experiencing it. So rather than speculating about this stuff, invest your time having direct experience of the things you speak of.
</p>

<p>
	Try this rule on for the next week: Do not speak of anything you have not directly experienced. Have you experienced a kangaroo? Then don't speak of it. Have you experienced being gay? Then don't speak of it. Have you experienced outer space? Then don't speak of it. Notice how this one rule cuts out a lot of bullshit from your mind. This is called being grounded. You must constantly reground yourself in this work because the tendency is to float off into metaphysical speculations, and then even worse, debate over those metaphysical speculations.
</p>

<p>
	If you really wish to honor the monks and yogis of the past then devote more time to meditation, contemplation, yoga, and psychedelics. That is the only way to validate the things they said.
</p>

He seems quite culty (although also genuinely enlightened). Not much new under the sun.
</p>

<p>
	Pathological enlightenment is much more common than people assume.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, watch out for young gurus especially. They are prone to be Zen Devils.
</p>

<p>
	Upgrading society is good. The problem is, it's much harder to do than almost anyone realizes. Good intentions, pleasant words, and even enlightenment is not enough. It takes conscious leadership and a degree of self-mastery which very few people have.

</p>

<p>
	The ego is incredibly strong and it will not allow you get rid of meaning so easily. If only it were so easy!
</p>

<p>
	It is a fact that no meaning whatsoever exists. This fact is very threatening to your way of life and your survival program. Which is why you are reacting with all those emotions. Those emotions are designed to get you back on track with your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	The fact that life is meaningless is itself meaningless, hence it is not bad or depressing.
</p>

<p>
	In order to be depressed you must assign negative meaning to life. So ironically the reason you're feeling so bad is because you are trapped inside an illusory world of (negative) meaning.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move is to surrender all meaning. But ego is not gonna let that happen without a huge stink.
</p>

<p>
	In a few days you will forget you ever watched that video and you will fall back asleep into your unconscious life, as though nothing ever happened. That's how sneaky the ego is. It will just sweep all this truth under the rug, out of your awareness.
</p>

<p>
	What you should be really worried about is falling back asleep, not losing meaning.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, ancient man was selfish, barbaric, and vicious like a wild dog.
</p>

<p>
	The end of slavery is a modern evolutionary advance.
</p>

<p>
	You have to consider the bigger picture. Consciousness not only has depth but breathed. God could go really deep by creating 5 enlightened masters or go very broad by creating 50,000 idoits hanging out on Facebook. Those 50,000 idiots might amount to more consciousness in the long run because they will breed like rabbits and share a technology like 5-MeO-DMT which then leads to 50,000 awakenings rather than just 5.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is highly nonlinear and counter-intuitive. Evolution is not a straightforward afair. What looks like steps backward are actually necessary steps forward. Therein lies the genius of the overall design. It's like a queen sacrifice in a masterful chess game.

</p>

<p>
	Just observe more rather than speculate.
</p>

<p>
	Sit down and observe what resistance is, how it works, when it arises, why it arises, when it passes, why it passes, what function is serves, what it feels like, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Those are all great questions.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of contemplation is not deconstruction per se but to get to the truth of the matter, to see what is actually the case.
</p>

<p>
	What is actually the case about resistance? To answer that you must spend a lot of time observing it. The mistake is speculating about it based on your assumptions and theories. Stop doing that! Rather, observe it from scratch and make mental note of what you see.
</p>

<p>
	Study it like a rare tropical butterfly under a microscope which you are seeing for the first time in your life.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, science does not know what anything is. ANYTHING!

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Get enlightened, realize God, and go about your life or leave this plane. I don't care. There's no need to debate it with me.
</p>

<p>
	If your intention is to leave this plane, then get on with it. No need to convince us of anything, no need to talk about nirvana on an online forum.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to lessen your karma, begin by letting go of debating differences between Buddhism and Hinduism.

<p>
	Basically correct. Except I still detect subtle duality in his descriptions. It sounds like he has not accessed total nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Still, pretty good for a nerdy scientist type.
</p>

<p>
	This kind of stuff is the future of science, philosophy, and cosmology.
</p>

<p>
	But just the fact that this guy is bragging about his IQ score already makes him not the smartest guy in the world.
</p>

<p>
	If he was a genius he should have known that mankind has understood the Absolute Truth for at least 5000 years before him.

<p>
	I was listening to an obscure podcast about psychedelics. One of the guests (I think it was Martin Ball) mentioned that 5-MeO-DMT creates total loss of ego. As soon as I heard that, I immediately knew this was the most important psychedelic to try.
</p>

<p>
	After I read some Reddit reports of people not liking 5-MeO-DMT because it was too much of a mindfuck and not fun, my conviction doubled. This was clearly the most important psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is very easy to suss out: it always lies behind a curtain of fear.
</p>

			what you are talking about is "enlightening experience" by using 5-MeO-DMT  which is not permanent.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, it's not permanent. But that does not make it any less true.
</p>

<p>
	It is precisely what it promises: total enlightenment for 60 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	To say that it is somehow not "real" enlightenment because it only lasts 60 minutes is a mistake. That's a judgment your ego is making. It is simply a fact that you can have an enlightenment which lasts 60 minutes. Careful with how you judge that.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru holds a week-long retreat which is specifically designed to give participants a short glimpse of enlightenment using yogic techniques. This is a peak experience of God which passes. Yet it is still valid and valuable, otherwise why would he hold such a retreat?
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is just a more efficient way of doing exactly that. It doesn't require a week, and it will take you deeper than a week-long retreat ever could.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to define the word "enlightenment" to only apply to permanent awakening, you can do that. But then you still have to allow that God can be fully realized non-permanently for 60 minutes. Realizing the Truth is independent of time or permanence. Whether it lasts for 10 seconds or 100 years, Truth is Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Confusion is created when people insist that there is only one right way to access Truth (their way). In fact, there are hundreds of ways to access Truth. Each come with their own pros and cons. The chief con of yoga is that it takes YEARS to deliver God realization. It takes so long that 95% of practitioners will quit before they get there. 5-MeO-DMT addresses this problem beautifully.
</p>

<p>
	Best to cycle it on and off, using it when it really counts.

<p>
	The ultimate solution is to develop yours consciousness to that state naturally through stuff like Kriya yoga. If you like Modafininil you will like Kriya yoga.

<p>
	You must do it at the right time. If you fully open up to her before you have sex with her, then that would be a mistake. There are different phases of dating and relationships. You must time things properly. For the first few months, keep things light otherwise you might come off too needy.
</p>

<p>
	Don't go sharing the skeletons in your closet on your first date.

That's selfishness, fear, and neediness. You are projecting your own selfishness and fear onto others.
</p>

<p>
	The correct attitude is to give your love freely, without expectation of return. True love is not about getting, true love is about giving.
</p>

<p>
	True love requires enormous courage and groundedness. Which requires that you grow and mature as a man. You have to be willing to experience loss, heartbreak, and rejection.
</p>

<p>
	Hint: you could die at any time. Why aren't to scared of death every day you wake up? Life could leave you at any time.
</p>

<title>I struggle with day game</title>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4543-marinus/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="4543" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4543-marinus/" rel="">@Marinus</a> That's great action-taking. 31 daytime approaches is a lot.
</p>

<p>
	There are many stages to a successful pickup that must be mastered: the open, body language, the smile, eye contact, keeping conversations going, flirtation, kino/touching, authenticity, sexual tension, hitting a hook point, screening for boyfriend, getting the close, leading and pulling for instant date, number closing, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's quite hard to learn all those on your own. It helps to go with a wing-man who already has experience with this and can help you evaluate your interactions. Try to find some wings in your city.
</p>

<p>
	A successful daytime approach requires a lot more than just opening the girl and saying Hi. You must learn to make the conversation fun, flirty, and interesting. And you must learn how to close in order to get any results. All daytime approaches must end with you asking the girl for an insta-date coffee.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you will be very awkward and mechanical at first. But you can quickly improve. Your goal should be to approach a girl in the same way you might approach and talk to your own girlfriend. It has to be very natural, like it's no big deal, like you've known her your own life. You must just assume this vibe and sense of friendship and familiarity right off the bat. It has to be super casual so the girl is not put on guard.
</p>

<p>
	A great way to practice conversation skills and body language is by chatting with store clerks at the mall. Go find some girl clerks. They are bored most the day and will be happy to talk with you. Try to flirt with them a bit without outright hitting on them. Try to get them to open up about themselves. Try to charm them a bit. Tease them. Wink and smile at them. Tell them some stories about yourself, etc.
</p>

<p>
	At this point your goal is not even to have sex but simply to become a more social, extroverted, talkative, charismatic person. You can even practice on guys and old ladies. Get good at small-talk and self-expression to strangers. Get good at building rapid social comfort, so people are comfortable around you. So they feel you as a fun friendly guy.
</p>

<p>
	I love day game. The biggest problem with it is that it's not easy to find a lot of hot girls during the day unless you live near certain great locations. Cities like LA, London, and NYC are amazing for daygame, but most cities aren't.
</p>

<p>
	The advantage of night is that you get a lot more girls to talk to. And there's possibilities for same night pulls.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, it's also VERY IMPORTANT that when you approach a girl during the day you stop her and face up to her squarely, face to face. Do not be approaching girls from the back or the side. If she is walking, you must stop her cold by getting her attention. You must face her directly. You must have her full attention before you deliver your opener. Do not be whispering your opener to her side or back as she is walking. Run around her and stop her without scaring her. And you must always open with a smile. If there is a look of fear on your face, she will freak out. Practice that smile like your life depends on it.
</p>

<title>Could a stage blue person regress To red if they realised good and bad dont exist?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31569-could-a-stage-blue-person-regress-to-red-if-they-realised-good-and-bad-dont-exist/?do=findComment&amp;comment=369835</link>

<p>
	Tis always possible to misconceive a stage and improperly apply advice.
</p>

<p>
	But most Blue people would just reject stage Green (relativism) rather than devolving into Red. So I wouldn't worry too much about devolving people merely by getting them to contemplate relativism.
</p>

<p>
	The transition out of stage Blue often feels like death, loss of faith, or the collapse of one's reality. Because stage Blue is so addicted to its rigid ideology and morals. To them it feels like their whole world is collapsing into nihilism. This is all just exaggeration and illusion, but it feels real to them nonetheless. Which is why its so hard to evolve people out of Blue. They are stubborn like mules and they will bite a helping hand. They will act aggressively ignorant.
</p>

<p>
	But it's worth trying. It's a good learning experience for you as a teacher to see how far you can push them.
</p>

<p>
	If you are teaching children, they can be quite openminded to radical ideas. But their parents might make a stink that you are corrupting the youth with your socialist post-modernist agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds dysfunctional and immature. Just because you've got some low-esteem girl on the hook doesn't really say much. If you wanted, you could actually grow yourself into doing a serious loving relationship. But that would mean really growing yourself and facing your fears of commitment, intimacy, honesty, etc.

<title>Isn't Developing your Dark Side just integrating RED</title>

<p>
	If you are equating The Shadow with stage Red, that's a very dangerous equation. Since shadow is also commonly present at Blue, Orange, Green, and even above.
</p>

<p>
	Every stage tends to have its own shadow: those aspects which you deny, repress, and project.
</p>

<p>
	Integrating Red is important, but it's not the only aspect of shadow work. Green shadows are very popular these days among stage Blue and Orange peeps.

	Don't think that we don't see right through your bullshit antics. They won't fly here, devil. Maybe go lurk on Reddit with your own kind where you can masturbate about how God is a delusion, reality actually exists, and how Sam Harris and Christopher Hitchens are great.

	The bottleneck isn't tolerance, it's your ability to integrate the insights.

	You could do it daily, but the mind won't be able to handle it after a while.

<p>
	You wanna make sure you're in the mood for it. Don't force things too much. Listen to your heart. Don't try to enforce a rigid schedule on your heart.

<p>
	I don't do pickup much any more.
</p>

<p>
	I have no problem with flirting with girls per se. My complaint was the ideology that many PUAs adopt and their stage Orange attitude towards sex and life.
</p>

<p>
	Flirting with girls is not necessarily at odds with long-term relationships or emotional investment. There is no relationship without flirting.
</p>

<p>
	All dating is a sort of manipulation and getting your own needs met, even if you never do pickup.
</p>

<p>
	99% of relationships of any kind are just you trying to getting your own needs met. You don't really care about anyone "as they really are", you care about how they can fit into your life and serve your needs.
</p>

<p>
	Dating and flirtation is a skillset. All skillsets are a set of "tricks" in that sense. If you want to get good around women you need to learn the rules of how that works. Pickup teaches some of those rules of attraction. How you then use them is up to you.
</p>

<p>
	Good pickup is not really about controlling girls. It's about controlling yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Controlling people is not something I recommend. You can become much more attractive and confident without having to control women.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than thinking of pickup as stuff you do to the woman, think of it as changing your own inner game and how you view women. Think of it as becoming a stronger, more authentic man.
</p>

<p>
	There are many versions of pickup. Some of it is very dysfunctional, some of it is great. You have to learn to sort the wheat from the chaff.
</p>

<p>
	As a man, dialing in your own inner game is great stuff. Learning to be charismatic, bold, and authentically expressive is great stuff. Elimimating various kinds of limiting beliefs about women is great stuff. Gaining lots of experience talking to women is great stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You have to remember, most women are very social and flirt and socialize non-stop. To them it is like breathing air. They develop a lot of this experience naturally in a way that many nerdy guys do not. Which is why many guys require extra training in a way that women do not. Guys have responsibilities with initating the flirt which women do not.
</p>

<p>
	And in the end all dating and relationship is a distraction from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Dating is a survival function. Dating is brutal whether you do pickup or not. People are very selfish in relationships by default. Women are also very selfish when selecting mates. Reproduction is a ruthless game which people tend to be in denial about.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with listening to Sadhguru without validating the things he says. He is never giving you the full picture but partial perspectives based on his limited life experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru has not done 5-MeO-DMT so he does not know what it can or cannot do, or how it changes the traditional yoga path. New technologies require re-thinking old orthodox models of enlightenment. Be careful with your assumptions.
</p>

<p>
	If you have not done breakthrough doses of 5-MeO, best to stay humble about it.

	Basically, yeah. He is denying Green aspects of himself, demonizing them, and projecting that out onto "other" in the world, thus making Green seem extra evil in his eyes.

<p>
	So for example, anyone making a critique of capitalism or Israel is seen as a clueless communist or an anti-Semite. When in fact the clueless one is Ben Shapiro. The ego disowns all of the Green aspects of itself.

<p>
	No, not an infinite number of facets.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you could consider every object in the universe to be a facet of God, but that's not what I mean when I say "facets of God". I am talking about facets of the Godhead, so to speak. God in it's purest form as opposed to God in disguise. There are not infinite facets there. Maybe a dozen or two at most. There is nothing special about the number of them. It's just a way the human mind carves it up, so don't take it too literally. God does not literally have 12 facets.

		<p>
			I don't know if you have ever reached a state called mental pliancy (I'm assuming not, based on how you talk about your monkey mind) where meditation is effortless because attention, placed anywhere, stays there because there is nothing in the mind to distract you. From that point unification of the mind continues, and as it happens "Platonic love" increases. Base state of a unified mind is love. Dalai Lama said that "equanimity is a root of loving-kindness", but then as equanimity increases to reach perfect equanimity (Nibbana), when object arise in consciousness and mind for the first time doesn't react to it with any aversion or desire - consciousness ceases and there is no experience.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This does not really contradict anything I said. It's just an alternative framing.
</p>

<p>
	That point where all consciousness ceases and there is no experience is precisely identical with this experienced moment right now. Experience is not an obstacle to total nondual consciousness. You can be in total nondual consciousness without experience or with experience.
</p>

<p>
	Also, how your mind reacts or doesn't react is a secondary thing. Your mind might react well or terribly and it doesn't really change the nature of the Absolute. Equanimity is usually a separate thing you must train. You can experience the Absolute without equanimity. You could be freaking the fuck out (as many people do on psychedelics).
</p>

<p>
	It is best to distinguish the training of one's mind from insight into the Absolute. You can have one without the other and vice versa. Both are important but also distinct.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, my mental training is not that good, but my insight is more advanced than most hardcore meditators. Because insight is what I care about most and because I cheated (using 5-MeO-DMT). Without 5-MeO-DMT it would have taken me 40 years to gain the insight I have now. And of course I can continue to do mental training.
</p>

<title>Evaluating iPEC Coaching Program on the Spiral</title>

<p>
	Yes, they are all those levels you listed.
</p>

<p>
	Their center of gravity is Greenish+
</p>

<p>
	Overall it's quite advanced. I actually underestimated them at first. I did not appreciate the importance of consciousness until long after graduating.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, most of their coaches have no idea what consciousness is. So they are not that advanced. But for what they are doing, they are just right. Their job is not to make you a Buddha but to help you establish a coaching biz, which is a Greenish+ endeavor overall.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about coaching, it's a great program. I don't regret paying $9000 for it. I've certainly made that money back. But I am an exceptional case. Most coaches struggle starting their biz. Really, I don't consider myself a coach. Although I did coach a lot for about 2 years.
</p>

<p>
	You just have to understand that starting any biz is hard, regardless of what it is. Hard but also exciting and fun.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that enlightened masters leave many of the best things unsaid. Which often creates confusion. Zen undersells and under-explains enlightenment, for example, to the point of deception.
</p>

<p>
	I spoil you guys with over-explaining everything.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: What Is Love?
</p>

<p>
	Love is not what you think it is. We are talking about Platonic love here, not romantic love.
</p>

<p>
	One of the great things about psychedelics is that they open you to Platonic love in a way that Zen meditation may not.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that there are many facets to God and few people or teachings have integrated them all. Many spiritual teachers simply haven't accessed all the facets. They are not easy to access and you could easily miss a facet without knowing it.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/11325-enlightenment/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="11325" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/11325-enlightenment/" rel="">@Enlightenment</a> There are many ways to half-ass enlightenment. There is a lot of depth to enlightenment. Many people only lick the surface and assume they understand when they really don't. Sam Harris is one such example. At deeper levels of awakening the materialist paradigm is entirely expunged to the point where it is silly to even talk about it or argue for it.
</p>

<p>
	I have experienced Nirvana. I have experienced total absolute consciousness and Truth. This is a radical claim and I can understand why you might doubt me. But it doesn't matter because Truth is Truth and nothing more can be said of it. Nor do I care whether you believe me or not. Nor does it matter if you do believe me. Either you understand it or you don't. It's way beyond any kind of notions of proof or validation or "changing your mind".
</p>

<p>
	If you seriously question the materialist paradigm you will see that it unravels faster than a mangy hand-knit sweater. This does not even require enlightenment. Materialism is rife with contradiction. Just question it. Give it a try. What is matter? What is energy? What is a brain? What is experience? What is science? What is knowledge? What is proof? How do you know science isn't a hallucination?
</p>

<p>
	I don't just self-validate, I cross-reference 100s of the highest quality sources across all disciplines and traditions. You guys are not understanding just how important that is.
</p>

<p>
	Let's talk after you've cross-referenced at least 100 books on spirituality and nonduality. And while you're at it, try cross-referencing your experiences with 20 gurus. The chief problem is that people simply lack a basic educational framework when it comes to enlightenment and spirituality. Because there do not yet exist sources which provide such an integral framework to lots of people. Because our education system is still in the Dark Ages.
</p>

<p>
	What you hear me talking about is cutting-edge stuff which will only become mainstream and normalized a few hundred years in the future, once we're all dead. Then it will all be taken for granted and treated as totally obvious and unquestionable. But until then, it will seem like quackery because the way you judge the validity of knowledge is purely through social proof. Because of laziness. You expect knowledge to be free and easy, when it is the opposite.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Worry is fear. Fear is fundamental to your entire way of life because you are committed to stay alive.
</p>

<p>
	There is only one way to eacape fear and worry, and that is to die.
</p>

<p>
	Which is precisely the whole point of enlightenment and spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	Peace is an escape from suffering. You will never escape suffering as an ego. The eacape from suffering is what the Buddha sought and discovered for himself. Which gives you a clue about what it takes to get peace of mind.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is, the moment the Buddha escaped suffering is the very same moment he died.
</p>

<p>
	But good... at least you have finally discovered the spiritual path.

</p>

<p>
	Beautiful design precisely requires that certain possibilities be excluded. Randomness is not beautiful design. Our world is not random.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is NOT just a random collection of all things. That's the paradox of it.

<title>Should I get modafinil for the SAT &amp; ACT</title>

</p>

<p>
	When you are on Modafinil or Armodafinil you are good. You don't need more focus. If anything, it's too potent.
</p>

<p>
	Too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing.

<p>
	No, I don't think so.
</p>

<p>
	The "physical laws" are held in place because they are necessary to have these kinds of human experiences we are having.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe if God wanted to be a 10-dimensional hyper-slug it wouldn't hold our physical laws. And that probably happens. But so long as you are human, to be human is to play within our physical ruleset at least to some degree. Otherwise you stop being human and become some kind of hyper-slug alien thing.

<p>
	But in a certain sense it does because evolution slowly weeds out devilry. That's its whole point!
</p>

<p>
	There is a Grand Design at work. I don't see God giving devils unlimited power. There are constraints on devilry. An unconstrained devil would turn all of creation into an ugly shitshow, spoiling the Beauty and Perfection of the Grand Design. You can't exactly allow Osama Bin Laden to materialize a nuclear weapon with his mind.
</p>

<p>
	At least that's my best guess so far.

<p>
	God's creation has exquisite balance. Perfect Divine Balance!

<p>
	That's your own doing.
</p>

<p>
	You assume that it's LSD which does this to you when it's actually your own mind that does this to you.
</p>

<p>
	A calm mind can take LSD and not experience this peaking.
</p>

<p>
	Your own fears are the cuplrit here. If you are sacred of ego-death you can trigger a panic attack through self-inquiry or meditation. Hell, some people suffer from panic attacks while sober! That's how touchy their egos are.

<title>The 5-MeO-DMT Mega-Thread</title>

</p>

<p>
	Yes, Nirvana is to cease to exist, which is identical to pure existence, which is identical to God, which is identical to Nothingness, which is identical to Buddha-mind, which is identical to Love, which is identical to Truth, which is identical to 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Death is Nirvana/Heaven. Death is a dip into the infinite ocean of pure consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The ego cannot properly understand this because it thinks death is terrible.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as non-existence! When you say non-existence what you're really talking about is the end of the ego. Which was unreal to begin with, so nothing is really lost!
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO can reveal all this to you, and more!
</p>

<p>
	If you ground Buddhism up into a fine snortable powder, it would be 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Consciousness is already nothing, so it needs no cessation, nor can it be ceased. There is only consciousness, only nothing. You guys are confused because you have not yet reached ultimate nonduality, the ultimate unification of formlessness with form. Form is not other than "cessation". Whatever deep sleep state you are imagining is not other than the waking state you are in right now.
</p>

<p>
	You are not properly understanding Buddhism because Buddhism cannot be properly understood without full nondual awakening. Buddhism is teaching extremely advanced things which even most Buddhists do not fathom. How could they? You cannot read this stuff in a book. And meditation is rarely enough. As the Buddha said, no one will understand.
</p>

<p>
	From what I understand he was not enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that it's easy to ape genuine spiritual paths and to create your own fake, distorted paths for the purposes of power, sex, money, etc. That's what he did. Even in a cult's teachings there are kernels of truth. That's precisely how the devil opperates, he mixes truth with bullshit until you can no longer tell them apart. This makes the bullshit easier to swallow.
</p>

<p>
	Hubbard was a sneaky devil who built a nest for devilry.

<p>
	More broadly, force does not exist. Force is just a made up human idea to explain stuff going on around him.
</p>

<p>
	There are no actual force vectors on objects the way you might draw them in physics class. All of that is a projection of the physicist's mind.
</p>

<p>
	Actual being happens magically and amechanically. Reality does not need math or forces to happen. It just be's whatever it wants because there is nothing outside itself to limit it.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: a king who had absolute power could materialize a chair out of thin air. He would not need to go saw down a tree and fashion a chair piece by piece. He could just imagine the chair into existence. And that would be the most efficient and direct way to make things. That's what absolute power allows: EVERYTHING!
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!

<p>
	That's like taking steroids for a boxing match, LOL. It's a serious performance boost. It would definitely up your score.
</p>

<p>
	But you shouldn't take it unless you experience no side-effects.
</p>

<p>
	Modinfinil is like that movie Limitless, but less extreme and far less negative side-effects.
</p>

<p>
	The SAT's should really start drug-testing students because this is a huge exploit.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you still have to study to know how to answer questions. But your recall times and focus will be a lot better, which is important for tightly-timed exams.

<title>Taking notes while reading</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31514-taking-notes-while-reading/?do=findComment&amp;comment=369018</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Yes, proper note-taking takes more time than reading the book itself, which is why most people never do it.
</p>

<p>
	But it can also get several times more value from the book, and you can return to those notes years later without having to re-read the book.
</p>

<p>
	Usually I just underline passages in the book. This is very fast compared to true note-taking, and it allows me to re-read a book very quickly, within 15-30 minutes by just reading the underlined sections. I never read a book without underlining it. Via underlining I basically condense a book down to the top 5% of its insights. Since most of the books words are just filler. You want to extract that 5% which is gold.
</p>

<p>
	Once a book as been properly underlined it becomes 10x more valuable. To the point where I've even thought about how I could sell my underlinings to you guys. But it's not practical.
</p>

<p>
	If I had an ashram, I would have a library of my underlined books which you guys could browse.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, consciousness definitely helps ground you and be more detached and authentic. But it's also not a cure-all. Approaching is a very specific skillset which needs to be honed, just like golf or tennis. Consciousness helps with all skillsets but doesn't replace training the skillset.

If you're still in school, you should even out and become more stable as you get older and practice more.
</p>

<p>
	As you build more positive habits and shed negative habits you should have less erratic ups and downs in your life.
</p>

<p>
	But the more you try to bull your way through issues, the more backlash you should expect. So maybe less bulling.
