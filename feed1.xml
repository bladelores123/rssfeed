			Actually, I've thought the same thing. I do both life-coaching and Tarot reading (both as lines of work), and they're quite similar.
		</p>

		<p>
			The main difference with the Tarot, in facilitating a person to find their own answers is that you're using a visual framing device, that has a more direct link to the archetypal/narrative aspects of the mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, the Tarot is a lot like a vehicle that can drive you to aspects of the mind that you would have a much harder time reaching without that vehicle. The difference between trying to walk across the desert versus driving.

	If you're gonna announce you do Tarot, your only clients will be hippies and witches.

	One of the downsides of hippies and witches is that they're usually poor.

<p>
	Read the Stanford article on idealism. It's explained there.
</p>

<p>
	Epistemtic idealism means that human knowledge is a construction of the mind. Ontological idealism means that physical reality is a construction of the mind.

<p>
	Hume is nice for starting philosophy but ultimately he's wrong in many foundational ways.
</p>

<p>
	Heraclitus is good but there's so little of him to read. It's just a handful of lines.
</p>

<p>
	Epictetus is great
</p>

<p>
	Heidegger is too confusing for me to bother with. It's not ultimately true enough.

<p>
	Kant is an epistemic idealist. He doesn't go far enough. What he's missing is ontological idealism.
</p>

<p>
	You're better off just reading summaries of such philosopher's work on Standard Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Otherwise you'll waste years read dense books which only make you more confused than you began.

<p>
	That's the whole problem of communication and abstract philosophical work. It's often impossible to really understand.
</p>

<p>
	Some philosophical writing is abstract that there is literally not enough information in the book to clearly know when it meant.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I shower you guys with so many examples. It's only from lots of examples can you understand the abstractions.
</p>

<p>
	Honestly, Kant is not worth your time to read. Kant is not nearly a profound as people make him out to be. Various distinctions he makes are confused and deluded.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to read some good Western philosophy, try Plotinus or Berkeley.
</p>

	The problem is you cannot your way out of this. You need a change in your state of consciousness. This can be done either via a psychedelic or very intense concentration/mindfulness practice.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking about it will not work.

<p>
	Of course there are a billion traps to maximizing love. That is what all of evolution is doing, and you think us humans can write it out in some kind of bulleted list?
</p>

<p>
	To understand how to maximize love best you must learn to tap into God Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And even then it will be messy and full of traps.

<p>
	The way you frame this is already a big problem.
</p>

<p>
	This distinction you make between mindset problems and actual problems is itself a mindset problem!
</p>

<p>
	What if all problems were nothing but your mindset towards them? Contemplate the significance of that.

</p>

<p>
	But it's not the only factor. There are other aspects of development, like how much emotional baggage and trauma is stored in your body.

	Depends on how you do it. If you smoke massive doses, sure.
</p>

<p>
	But if you plug moderate doses, then no.
</p>

<p>
	And if you do it properly it can actually be healing.

			Seems like a lot of you guys are doing these powerful psychedelics extremely often, do you believe in an integration period? Is there benefit to doing it so often? Like from my understanding 5 meo is the most intense experience the human psyche can undergo, is it just like that on the regular after repeated use? I mean if you are doing the most profound experience you could possibly imagine on a weekly or monthly basis, what is the rush to jump back in so quickly besides escaping your baseline mind state? This is not a criticism, am just curious 
		</p>

<p>
	It's all relative.
</p>

<p>
	There have been times where I did it only once a year. And there have been times where I did 13 days in a row.
</p>

<p>
	The more advanced you get the more often you can do it without needing a lot of integration time.
</p>

<p>
	They key is to be intuitive about. Don't get set any rigid or dogmatic schedule. Do it as you're called to do it. Sometimes you will not be called for months. And sometimes you'll be called to hit it hard several days back to back.
</p>

<p>
	The most I grew in my life was from 13 back to back days. Words cannot describe the levels of superhuman insight gained. The entire universe became known to me. I had to really force myself to do it back to back 13 times. Your mind won't want to do it that much. Most people would feel like they've gone insane. It requires a really good theoretical foundation in nonduality.

<p>
	A friend of mine once did a Tarot reading of me.
</p>

<p>
	It was surprising good.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that it predicts your future, but rather is works by getting your own mind to clarify its own desires and obstacles.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like an occult form of life coaching, where the answers don't come from the coach but from the mind of the person being coached.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make regarding Tarot is thinking of it as some fortune telling device. It's not that.

<p>
	The point is to maximize consciousness and love across all living beings.

<p>
	You are very naive about how corporations do business & about white collar crime.
</p>

<p>
	The entire political system is deliberately designed to redistribute wealth upwards to the most powerful. There is nothing arbitrary about it. That is right-wing trickle down economics.
</p>

<p>
	Weakening the government by going the "limited government" route will only make this problem worse.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be a limited government when greater levels of social organization require massively complex management systems. You cannot have all of today's modern technological luxuries while also organizing government via caveman politics.
</p>

<p>
	With caveman government you get caveman lifestyle.

	Spirituality is about facing your fears and realizing that all fear is illusion.
</p>

<p>
	The whole function of life is learn how to love vs fear. That is really the only thing you're doing here in life. Everything is just a variation on this theme. Take a look.

<p>
	Your views of how government and capitalism work are very naive.
</p>

<p>
	Capitalism IS a redistribution of resources to giant corporations and the most powerful and manipulative people, which undermines democracy. Social democracy is a check on that redistribution of wealth to elites. Elites use capitalism to extract massive amounts of wealth from the rest of society regardless of the damage it causes.
</p>

<p>
	Democracy + capitalism is a contradiction. There is no such thing. If you have capitalism you have anti-democracy because money buys all politicians. This leads to corporatism, plutocracy, and corruption. Corruption is not a function of evil people doing bad things, it's a function of money infecting the democratic process in a systemic way.
</p>

<p>
	The Kochtopus is still thriving. It goes way beyond any one individual. It's an ideology and a super-organism that takes on a life of its own.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to The Family Netflix documentary. Just because Doug Kho is dead, doesn't mean The Family isn't a big problem in politics.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise with Trumpism. Trumpism will be a problem even after Trump leaves office because it is a larger ideological force.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about attacking Trump, it's about making people aware of the larger systemic forces and self-deceptions at work which lead to devils like Trump and Koch bros to thrive.

<p>
	You misunderstand Osho. I see people here quoting spiritual masters in such twisted ways, where you end up doing the every opposite of what they teach.

	It makes sense to you because it is music to a devil's ears. A devil loves nothing more than to hear a great teacher give him permission to be a devil.

<title>How to stop enjoying pornography?</title>

<p>
	It's not about stopping enjoying it. It's about finding a higher purpose in your life, something that you find more meaningful.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to stop enjoying porn.
</p>

<p>
	And there's nothing wrong with enjoying porn either. Porn is just part of the beauty of reality. Be grateful it exists.
</p>

<p>
	It means you imagine it.
</p>

<p>
	It exists only because you create it. If you stop creating it, it will stop existing.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a matter of belief. It is a matter of becoming conscious of how you are creating it.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you are not yet conscious of how you are creating your own brith. You have confused the idea of your birth for some real event outside your own mind. It doesn't even occur to you that your birth could be imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, you are basically insane, imagining stuff like a psychotic. The most importing thing you are imagining is that you are not imagining but that its all real.
</p>

<p>
	That's precisely the kind of attitude that a devil will exploit to his advantage.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that a devil doesn't play fair. That's what makes him a devil. If you give him the benefit of the doubt, he will exploit it. Which is why once some proves himself to be a pathological liar, narcissist, or con artist you should never take him seriously again. The way a con artist works is precisely by conning you and then repenting and exploiting your soft heart to con you a second and third time.
</p>

<p>
	Trump behave exactly in this matter. Which is why nothing that comes out of his mouth can ever be given the benefit of the doubt. Given his past history, everything that comes out of his mouth should be considered a lie unless proven otherwise. That is how you properly deal with a con artist. You don't trust him ever again.

<p>
	What we really need long-term is a new transformative technology that will either: 1) remove carbon from the atmosphere, and/or, 2) block sunlight from reaching the Earth in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	I envision a sort of giant thin film set up in space which simply blocks sunlight from reaching the planet like sun glasses. With such a technology we would not only eliminate global warming forever but we could actively regulate the temperate on the planet to maximize consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But something like this needs to be funded by big government research.
</p>

<p>
	It's quite obvious that advanced civilizations learn to regulate the climate on their planet.
</p>

<p>
	As a species it's like we're living in the age before air conditioning.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being able to selectively regulate the sunlight in desert regions like the Sahara or the Gobi, making it lush and livable!
</p>

<p>
	We could even install a UV filter so people don't get sunburned.
</p>

<title>Advice on contemplation</title>

<p>
	If you are prone to depression then contemplation could be problematic in the sense that you will get lost inside your own mind. You have to careful here to balance between theory & practice. For a depressed person going to the gym might be more effective to change one's mood than contemplating on the couch about one's mood.
</p>

<p>
	But it the long run you should build yourself up to the point where you can contemplate things without it driving you deeper into depression. As you become more developed and conscious it will be easier for you to let go of being stuck in your own mind. Kriya yoga & meditation helps a lot with this.
</p>

<p>
	If all you do is sit and think (without any yoga or meditation practice) you will end up getting lost in your own mind. And this will create various kinds of dysfunction.
</p>

<p>
	So watch out! The mind can be a very dangerous thing. Then again, being mindless can be even more dangerous.
</p>

	JP is actually a smart guy with some good insight into psychology and human nature.
</p>

<p>
	But his politics suck.
</p>

<p>
	There are two very distinct sides to JP: his academic side and his political side. The problem is he mixes them so it's like he prepares you a fine gourmet meal, but with a turd on top.

<p>
	Oh there will be major backlash if Bernie get elected. The corporatists will start flinging shit like never before.
</p>

<p>
	See, we've never seen the corporate elite truly get their feet held to the fire the way Bernie would do.
</p>

<p>
	Big industries like oil and gas, coal, pharma, health insurance, Wall Street, banking, etc. will be in an uproar and will invest billions in ads to manipulate their way back into power.
</p>

<p>
	Billions will pour into the Fox News propaganda machine. It will be get real nasty. They will do everything possible to take Bernie down. Because this hits them right at the heart of their survival agenda: money!
</p>

<p>
	The health insurance industry will fight to the bitter end like a cornered animal because if Bernie get his way, they're dead overnight. They have nothing to lose. They will go down swinging.

<p>
	You're missing the deeper mindfuck here: there are no such things are rocks because a rock does not know it is a rock. You project that "rock" onto the world in the same way you project your own ego.
</p>

<p>
	A rock doesn't really have an age because who is to say what counts as rock vs not-rock? Only your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The true age of the rock is identical to that of your body because they are indistinguishable. Both are Eternal until you project time onto the sitution.

<p>
	Distinction = difference = form = duality
</p>

<p>
	So you are asking, What is difference?
</p>

<p>
	If reality is made out of differences, then what is a difference made out of?
</p>

<p>
	Notice you get a paradox here because if you say, Difference is made out of nothing. That nothing is still a difference. This question cannot be answered at the level of langauge. An awakening is required. You must somehow jump out of the domain of language altogether because all that language is are differences, so you can't use language to understand difference itself. Creating more differences is not the same thing as groking what difference is.

	Self-deception is a VAST topic with many sub-topics. It's the bulk of how humans fool themselves into believing they are human.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that this stuff cannot simply be taught or explained, it requires deep self-reflection, contemplation, and consciousness work -- which virtually nobody is willing to do.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you do it, you'll still get tripped up in self-deception. Self-deception does not joke around. It's seriously deceptive.

	Bernie is more left than Warren obviously.
</p>

<p>
	I prefer to elect the highest leader possible and let the chips fall where they may. The system will deal with it. Gradualism has been tried with Obama and it failed. Another 8 years of someone like Obama is going to make things even worse. The system needs some serious change of the status quo.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie is not a Green version of Trump. Trump is a moronic lying narcissist. Bernie is an intelligent, honest, compassionate leader.
</p>

<p>
	A Green version of Trump would be 20 year old Green Peace activist with bipolar disorder who wants to jail people for eating fish and force children to eat soy, who faces a criminal case for sabotaging factory farms.

	Carbon Tax! There's your answer. But JP is lost in philosophical right-wing distractions.

	To maintain his anti-SJW position he has to make it seem like climate activism is somehow foolish when it is actually the most obvious thing. What's foolish is criticizing people who care about the environment.

	The most important thing is not to free the slaves but to get people to realize that slavery is not right. Once people realize that slavery is not right, the freeing of the slaves will be inevitable.

<p>
	If the mind is deeply stilled a nondual state of consciousness will eventually set in, because duality is created by an active mind.
</p>

<p>
	But merely 5 minutes of stillness will not be enough. You need long periods of stillness over many days, weeks, months, years. It can't just be a temporary stillness, the mind actually has to rewire itself to be less active by default.
</p>

<p>
	From stillness insight can arise. This insight leads to enlightenment.

</p>

<p>
	That's when everything goes full-circle and you find yourself smearing your feces on your neighbor's dishes.
</p>

<p>
	Then when the prison psychiatrist examines you, and asks you what's wrong with you, you'll tell him that right vs wrong is just a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Then when he suspects you're insane, you'll tell him that that sanity vs insanity is just a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Then they will put you in the insane asylum where you will be safely kept away from infecting the minds of ordinary folks with the Truth.

<p>
	Enlightenment is not about seeing through my eyes. Enlightenment is about something even more radical: realizing you are the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	To realize you are the entire universe does not require you to live through many different lives. You can realize it by staying in your current life.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about becoming multicentered but rather becoming omnipresent/nothing. This does not allow you to see through others eyes. You just realize you are EVERYTHING regardless of what is visible. Your consciousness goes so infinite that visual data simply doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
	Bottomline is: you are too attached to visual forms. They are not important in this pursuit. You need to turn inward and inquire what you are. That will then explode into infinity.
</p>

<p>
	The nothing you find through self-inquiry is also infinity, since nothing and infinity must be identical. This infinity is what connects you to all living beings without any need to look through their eyes.
</p>

<p>
	I don't need to experience your life to know I am you. All I need to do is realize I am infinite.

<p>
	As the Ehrlich tells you, it's purple and therefore an Indole, which means it's a tryptamine, which means it's probably what the label claims.
</p>

<p>
	There is no test purely for 5-MeO-DMT. All you can test for is Indoles.
</p>

<p>
	You substance looks legit. The color of the powder itself looks good. That looks like some pure 5-MeO.

</p>

<p>
	You are the obstacle to understanding this.
</p>

<p>
	In truth you ARE looking through the eyes of all being simutaneously. One of whom is this human you think you are now. To be a human precisely means that you are only looking through one set of eyes.
</p>

<p>
	To look through the eyes of all humans does not mean you get to compare all their experiences. It means precisely that you are cut off in your own little private world. A trilion private worlds.
</p>

<p>
	It works just like an online mutliplayer game.
</p>

<p>
	You are me writing this comment. But you are so fully me that you don't even know you're you! Because you are fully me! You are so fully me that you have no memory of ever having been you! And vice versa.

</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is that you are imagining being me while still retaining elements of you. No, you have to fully forget yourself. In other words, you must die. Still want to be me?

<p>
	You're talking about here is dual vs nondual states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	In a nondual state of consciousness the notion of a self is missing. You and reality are one. Subject and object are one.
</p>

<p>
	How long it lasts can vary depending on many factors. It could last a minute or a lifetime.

<title>Is Fluoride &quot;Calcifying your Pineal Gland&quot; a myth?</title>

<p>
	It's hard to say. I would avoid it just to be safe. You can find some good organic toothpastes without fluoride. And obviously you should not be drinking tap water. So this is a pretty easy fix. All you gotta do is ditch the cheap chemical toothpaste, which cannot be good for you regardless of the fluoride question.
</p>

<p>
	I have been fluoride free for a couple of years and my teeth are as good as ever. I don't let my dentist use fluoride on me. They can keep that shit for themselves, hehe.

<p>
	Make yourself successful first so that you're not coming from a place of fear or need, then have your kid.
</p>

<p>
	Devote 5-10 years of your life to building a good career/biz. If you do that well, having a kid should not be a problem financially.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like you're very young, so be patient and pace yourself. There's no need to have a kid in your 20s.

<p>
	Majority of people are just for the status quo because they haven't even bothered to think of anything else.
</p>

<p>
	And such people are extremely vulnerable to psychological manipulation, which is what media propaganda does.
</p>

<p>
	Don't give the average person too much credit. 200 years ago, the average person would not have a strong opinion pro or anti slavery. They're just sheep following the herd off a cliff.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, they may even be willing to listen, but they are not willing to think deeply about anything.
</p>

<p>
	Neutrality is an extremely dangerous thing. It gets easily exploited by devils.

But it's a good safe entry point.
</p>

<p>
	50-100mg is where things get serious.
</p>

<p>
	After you reach 50mg, increase in 10mg increments.
</p>

<p>
	If 20mg is barely noticable for you, jump up to 50mg.

<title>The problem with open-mindedness</title>

</p>

<p>
	It's very helpful be keep that in the back of your mind at all times.
</p>

<p>
	Closedminded people will of course project their closedmindedness onto you. That is devilry 101. But be careful because you can easily fall into that trap yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that reality is such that you can never draw any clear & stable lines. When you deeply grok this, you stop worrying about drawing lines. Drawing lines is the chief human delusion. All drawn lines are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	I have not drawn any firm lines. I'm always open to being proven wrong.
</p>

<p>
	But practically, I usually know when someone is bullshitting me because I have a lot of direct experience to fall back on. But even so, I'm still open because my understanding is never complete or perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like a far-right nationalist I would not even bother taking seriously. They are obviously and hopelessly unconscious. It's not worth the time reasoning with them because they are completely in denial about their self-biases.
</p>

<p>
	Just because your mind is open does not mean you have to take every fool seriously.
</p>

<p>
	As a good rule of thumb, before taking a person's intellectual position seriously, I first need to see that he/she has a basic understanding of self-deception and self-bias. If they do not understand the significance of self-deception or self-bias, I can basically guarantee they are deeply deluded and so I will never take them too seriously. I can still learn from them, but it's going to be small potatoes stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Once you have some awakening to the Absolute, that gives you a nice ground for cutting through bullshit. Until then you're really lost in a sea of bullshit with no clear compass to orient yourself because you cannot even know if anything I say is true.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If you create any separation whatsoever between you/God, that's a duality.

<p>
	It goes even deeper. There is no difference between fake and real.
</p>

<p>
	The universe cannot tell what is fake, since everything, even fake things, have to be imagined by consciousness, otherwise they would no be at all.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, fake tits are still real, and real tits are just a dream <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />

<p>
	Remember that consciousness is pure imagination. It can be highly symbolic and abstract. Eyes are like an archetype.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	There is a subtle duality in this framing because it assumes that there are "things" which are conscious. Nothing is conscious. There is only consciousness and various illusions of things being conscious.
</p>

<p>
	This framing of "things can be conscious" is a distortion of the ego. Consciousness is prior to things. So things cannot have consciousness. Things are imagined by consciousness.

<p>
	Dry insight tends to work very poorly in my experience.
</p>

<p>
	The key function of psychedelics is to lube up the mind, placing it in a deep samadhi state from which profound insight becomes almost effortless.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are samadhi in a pill.
</p>

<title>Signs of US/Global recession</title>

<p>
	Remember, even if there is a recession, it's not necessarily a big deal. It might just be a few quarters of slowed growth.
</p>

<p>
	It's just too early to tell. People have a tendency to over-exaggerate things. After 10 years of non-stop growth a bit of recession is normal and not a problem. You can't expect never-ending growth.
