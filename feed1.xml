<p>
	Just sit and do nothing or concentrate on awareness itself.
</p>

<p>
	Total surrender to the present moment is very effective for me.

<p>
	Yes, and I expect humans will soon start altering their DNA and brain chemistry to become more God-like.

<p>
	I don't think it can be explained to you until the moment of a massive Awakening to yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	It only makes sense in retrospect.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the way it works is, God has lost himself and is now trying to find himself. So he's giving himself clues and wake up calls all the time, but the lost part of him doesn't recognize the clues and resists waking up out of fear. Until one day he wakes up and realizing what all the clues were that led to it.
</p>

<p>
	It's like reading a detective mystery novel. The clues will only make sense after the final reveal.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see any way right now to be permanently at 30mg of 5-MeO-DMT. Not even close. It's far too much consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But I think I can raise my baseline state of consciousness significantly with more practice of just sitting and emptying out my mind. That's what I'll be working on.

<p>
	Except you haven't yet realized your full true nature. To realize your true nature requires radical understanding of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	You can be in state of peace and fulfillment, but that is not the same as being Awake as God.
</p>

<p>
	A cat can sit and be at peace and fulfilled. But it has no clue what God is.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't think a sober Total Awakening is even possible.
</p>

<p>
	If I just sit in silence, I will be mildly conscious that I am God. Nothing crazy. It's a subtle, mild sense. There's not really anything left to awaken to. The present moment, whatever it is, is what is. The longer I sit, the more conscious my state becomes. I am not actively searching for anything anymore. It's just a matter of sitting like a cat and being conscious. The more I sit like a cat, the more my consciousness builds on itself.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, your practice boils down to sitting like a cat and enjoying it. Nothing flashy.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly not.

<p>
	But I also don't know anyone who truly is in abiding peace. You have to be careful with such idealizations. In practice I see even enlightened teachers struggle and get agitated and have aversions and cravings.

<p>
	Mostly you will return to your old state, but also something will change in you. But you certainly won't be able to sustain the 5-MeO-DMT peak.

That reduced stress overall on my life regarding if my brain was feeling good or bad. My idea until know is that total Awakening is discovering the ultimate truth and knowing that truth basically dissipates all of your fears and so on, like it wouldn't have to depend on what state your brain is (again, you can change brain by conscioussness)

<p>
	It is a realization, but this realization requires a certain state. But you can also train up this state so it's fairly stable. That's the point of spiritual practices. They cultivate the state and make the realization easily accessible.

<p>
	Except it's not reliable at all. And Awakening has nothing to do with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
	The point of pursing Awakening is if you want to discover what reality is.

	Be to Awake is to be in a state of God recognizing itself as God. When Awakening goes away, God is still here. But you aren't aware of it as God.

	Yes, it seems that way.

<p>
	It's okay, you are just misunderstanding what is being said.
</p>

<p>
	ONENESS is a paradoxical thing. You become so together with everything and everyone, that you are all Alone.
</p>

<p>
	Together = Alone
</p>

<p>
	The duality collapses. It's not negative at all. It's wonderful! But the ego might freak out at first.

<p>
	It's Love!

<p>
	If you were Awake you wouldn't be asking these questions, you'd know.
</p>

<p>
	To be asleep means to not be aware that you are God. That doesn't mean you are not aware at all. It means you are pretending to be human.

	I wouldn't say it was some chemical synergy. It's just that as I explore consciousness more from many different angels my understanding becomes more and more holistic.

<p>
	There is definitely a benefit to tripping with different substances so you can appreciate the full range of what consciousness can do.

<p>
	The problem with stuff like meditation is that it's so one-dimensional. You never see the full range.

	After a lot of trial of other things, I returned to 5-MeO-DMT and it took on a whole new level of power for me beyond any other thing I have tried.

	DPT is amazing, but I gotta say, these days, for me, 5-MeO-DMT is more amazing. The clarity of it is insane.

<p>
	Salvia is too wacky. 5-MeO-DMT is where you'll find total Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	The length of it is irrelevant. It might only last 30 minutes. But during those 30 minutes it is total. There is no time during it.

		</p>

			When you talk about "you imagined this and that"   I dont know if you are talking from God POV or limited human form POV. Last would be solipsism. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There was a time when you always made it clear from which perspective you talk. Maybe you changed a lot. Are you from now on per default talking from Gods POV ?  If yes, I can read this whole thread again, lol.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, I'm mostly talking from God's POV since you are God and that's what's True. Why would I talk from an invented human POV?
</p>

<p>
	Humans are not real things. They are imaginary. So let's stop talking as if they are real.
</p>

<p>
	If you see a picture of a human on TV, does that make that human real? No! Likewise, when you see a human walking down the street, does that make the human real? No! When you see your face in the mirror, does that make you a human? No! When you look down and see a human body which you think of as yours, does that make you a human? No! Just because you see some pictures doesn't mean you are those pictures.
</p>

<p>
	If I show you a picture of a kangaroo, does that make you a kangaroo? What if I make you wear a kangaroo suit? Would you become a kangaroo then?

<p>
	Because Awakening is Absolute. The Absolute tends to be sure of itself.
</p>

<p>
	Why would God be unsure of itself? Unsureness suggests a lack of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But the converse is a trap: just because you're sure of yourself doesn't mean you are conscious.

<p>
	Consciousness has infinite capacity for self-understanding. It can understand everything about itself (Total Awakeness) or it can be as dumb as a rock. And everything in between.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said in my series: Understanding Duality, that's a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is imagining a distinction between temporary things and permanent things.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, all consciousness is Eternal and Absolute. Awakening transcends time since consciousness imagines time.
</p>

<p>
	If awakening was permanent how could anyone ever awaken? -- since they would already have been awake!
</p>

<p>
	God can exist in various states of self-awareness. In some states God is not self-aware at all. In other states God is mildly self-aware. And in other states God is fully self-aware. There are not just 3 or 10 of these states. There are thousands if not more.

<p>
	That doesn't hold up.

<p>
	The US government didn't crack down on the hippies because the hippies were draining their body energy.

<p>
	The US government cracked down because the hippies were starting to question all of the conservative Christian norms which held American society together.
</p>

<p>
	I have yet to see any evidence that psychedelics drain your body or harms your energetic system. If you want to make such claims, bring the evidence. Serious claims require serious evidence.

<p>
	My health issues are an independent variable. I've had a thyroid disease for 10 years, before I even started Actualized.org or knew about psychedelics. I've struggled with it for a long time. And as I get older my health isn't as good as it used to be.
</p>

<p>
	People are far too eager to blame psychedelics for anything that goes wrong.
</p>

<p>
	If I broke my leg tomorrow, people would say, "See! It's those damn psychedelics! I knew it!" Because people are looking any excuse they can find to reject psychedelics. Because psychedelics are gonna nuke that ego and deep down the ego knows it. The ego-mind needs to paint psychedelics as illegitimate. Then it's safe to play its spiritual games. A Buddhist can only keep being a Buddhist if he doesn't do enough psychedelics.

</p>

<p>
	So, for example, if you want to manifest a rock, not only would you have to imagine the rock as real for you, but you would also have to imagine that the rock is real for everyone else on Earth.
</p>

<p>
	That's easier said than done.
</p>

<p>
	And most people are not even open to such a possibility.

<p>
	Well, that's just a practical problem. How can a teacher recommend them if they are illegal in most places? This would get the teacher in trouble. It doesn't scale. And this assumes the teacher has lots of experience with them, which none of them do because they have been so tightly controlled and demonized.
</p>

<p>
	It's a catch-22. Teachers can't recommend them unless they become more widely available. And they can't become more widely available unless teachers recommend them. Thus it is a circle of ignorance. The only way to break that circle is with visionary leadership and by challenging authority, which is dangerous.

<p>
	Of course that's a huge factor.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics have the power to wake people up and melt down all socially constructed belief systems. As a result they are extremely dangerous and threatening to those in positions of power and authority. So they must be locked down and tightly controlled to maintain the illusion of society.
</p>

<p>
	If the US government did not crack down on the hippie psychedelic revolution of the 60's and early 70's, the people in power could not stay in power any longer. Which is why psychedelics are commonly demonized in all cultures. Christians demonized psychedelics and witchcraft because it was a threat to the authority of the corrupt church.
</p>

<p>
	Yogis do this too. If 5-MeO-DMT was widely available, yogis like Sadhguru would be out of business.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that 5-MeO-DMT is not like any other psychedelic, and it was only discovered/synthesized in the last 50 years.

<p>
	So it's a cutting edge technology that no one knows about. No yogi knows about it.

	Maybe yoga is better than weed or datura. But it is not better than 5-MeO-DMT.

	Maybe some people can. But you ain't gonna generate 30mgs of it. Maybe a few milligrams. And even that is dubious.

<p>
	Exceptional people have naturally different neurotransmitters, giving them a "natural high".
</p>

<p>
	But even they have not reached the highest levels as you can reach on something like 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>
	Psychedelics and herbs have been used for over 50,000 years. It's just not advertised on CNN so you don't know about it.

</p>

<p>
	How can a creature have a robust immune system if it is never put to the test? And how can it be put to the test unless some people die?
</p>

<p>
	Do you want your children to be sickly weaklings? Then fight that virus!
</p>

<p>
	A thing cannot grow strong unless it encounters resistance.
</p>

<p>
	But see, if you were weak and sickly, you would complain, "Why God? Why did you make me so weak." And yet when God tries to make you strong by infecting you with a virus, you complain too. You complain in every case. That's the game you're playing.
</p>

<p>
	The virus is nicely showing the weaknesses of society as it is currently organized. The weakness of our political systems. So that your grandchildren could live in a stronger society with robust healthcare and economic systems. The healthcare and economic systems are not going to fix themselves without external pressure. Society evolves as a response to survival challenges. So here we are. Evolution is happening every day, through you! Your struggles are what makes evolution work. Which creates all of life.

<p>
	This gives you an idea of how there is no self/other and how consciousness works:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="morphing-01.gif" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed" data-fileid="22052" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_03/morphing-01.gif.a522ebe7b0d824a05c9749d11882cb40.gif" />
</p>

<p>
	You are THAT! Not any one person. You are the entire field of consciousness which generates the whole show. This field is highly intelligent and completely omnipotent in its creative power.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being so Awake that instead of seeing physical objects or people, you see the above AND you are aware of how you are doing that.
</p>

<p>
	Stare at that gif for a while and try to notice how there is no self there. Or, another way to put it is: there is only the ONE infinite Self which includes all possible finite limited selves.
</p>

<p>
	Because you are busy imagining the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	No matter what you imagine, you could always complain: "But why can't I have the opposite?! Why can't I flap my arms and not fly?!"
</p>

<p>
	So here you are. God pretending not to be God.
</p>

<p>
	You expext God to be some other way, but God is busy being precisely the way it is right now. You are always one step behind.
</p>

<p>
	To create the illusion of physical reality God had to make sure it couldn't just flap its arms and fly. That would not be physical reality, that would be some kind of dream world.  But if you were in this dream world you would complain that it doesn't feel solid enough, it doesn't feel real enough.
</p>

<p>
	The cost of things feeling "real" is not being able to change them on a whim.
</p>

<p>
	For Leo to feel real for you, you must be in denial that you are imagining Leo. If you knew for sure that you imagined Leo, then that would destroy the possibility of Leo being "real" for you. You'd know you are pretending. So the game you're playing is pretending that you are not pretending so that you can really pretend.
</p>

<p>
	It only differs in depth and breadth of understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Other gurus are not wrong, their understanding is just not as complete.
</p>

<p>
	There are higher and higher levels of completeness.
</p>

<p>
	It is similar to math or science. Euclid's geometry from 2000 years ago was not wrong, but it was also not as complete as our understanding of geometry today.

<p>
	What you're not conscious of is that from God's POV there's absolutely no difference between a child dying of cancer at age 5 vs that child living a healthy life till 100. From your biased, selfish POV there is a difference between these two outcomes. From God's POV there is no value judgments of any kind and therefore no difference whatsoever. God does not mind dying of cancer at 5 years old. Why would it matter if God is immortal and Perfect?
</p>

<p>
	You see the problem here? God loves itself absolutely. But you don't. Hence you think cancer is a problem. But God does not. If you had unconditional Love, you would not have a problem with cancer or premature death. The only reason you struggle with these things is because you are not conscious enough to love yourself. You are afraid of yourself. But God is not because it is fully conscious of itself to such a degree that no fear is possible.

			Okay, this is the most by far difficult stuff to grasp as our mind thinks in a liner way. When I start thinking of it, it gives me a headache. I can not grasp that time does not exist and never did, and that I will not be able exit from this reality it in the future with my death. Like I will be in this moment forever, or I have never been born. Well, I am okay with it, but what about yesterday? it felt so real, an hour ago was real. I can not understand this. I have a memory of walking outside an hour ago in my neighborhood. I can stomach that I have never been born, but I can not stomach that I have never walked outside an hour ago.

<p>
	That's right. The logical mind cannot grasp it. It's far too radical.

<p>
	That's an even bigger mindfuck. Because God is absolute Perfection and God has no choice but to be Perfect, Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	God cannot not be God. God cannot say, "I don't like diseases so I will stop them". Because God is precisely what is. How can God remove a disease when God IS the disease? God cannot destroy itself because destruction is God too! Since God is Infinite, it is EVERYTHING, and therefore cannot be otherwise and cannot be different.
</p>

<p>
	When you think a disease is a sign of imperfection, that's merely because you lack the consciousness to see its absolute Perfection. Only God is able to understand its own Perfection. You have to be God to understand that God is Absolutely Perfect. A human cannot understand God's Perfection because the Perfection is infinite.

	Again, this is the mindfuck: nothing happens when Leo dies because death is imaginary! LOL

<p>

<p>
	It will not look like anything because it will not happen! You are imagining Leo's death. Stop doing that.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that in order to engage in this mental speculation your mind has to project into the future. Your mind is literally creating the future as you ask these confusing philosophical questions. And so you get yourself trapped in illusions.
</p>

<p>
	When you wonder, "But what will happen from Leo's POV when his body dies" you are literally creating the possibility of Leo, his body, and it's death. But you aren't conscious of what you're doing. You're taking it all for granted, as if Leo, his body, and its death were real.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's more twisted than that. I have existed in this moment for Eternity. As God. Leo is just some idea God overlays on top of the present moment. Like putting on a mask. There is no reason why you could not pretend right now that you are Leo. That would be as true as me pretending to be Leo. Leo is an imaginary thing. You could imagine you are Leo, or Arnold, or Trump, or Jesus. These are all just masks God can wear. But right now you're too busy wearing your personal mask because you think it is real and true. You think that you cannot be Jesus because that wouldn't be true. But that assumes there is a true mask. But all masks are imaginary. You can pretend to be Jesus from this day forth and it will be as true as the actual Jesus. Since "the actual Jesus" has never been anything more than your imagination!
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is that you're still assuming the existence of a past. Notice how you say, "before Leo life-time". That assumes a past which is real. But the "before Leo life-time" is something you are imagining right now! You are creating the past by imagining it. There never was a "before Leo life-time" and there will never be an after Leo life-time. That is, unless you imagine it to be so. If I start imagining that I'm a kangaroo, then that will be who I am at that moment. If I stop imagining altogether, then I will be Nothing/Formless.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine you had a past life, that becomes true for you. But when you Awaken you realize all of that was imagination at play and none of it was anything solid.

			I've had some awakenings and realizations but I want to see if they correlate to what you're saying. Are you conscious of previous lives? If they exist you could be interacting with yourself from previous lives because time doesn't exist. You know that you're conscious and I know that I'm conscious, both are right, what you are experiencing now is the god head, and what I'm experiencing now is the god head. The only difference is the god head can only experience itself one at a time, and the previous lives are the distinction. Basically what I am saying is that from every single persons perspective, they are conscious, but because time doesn't exist everyone sees themselves as the god head and no one is wrong, because you're just interacting with yourself from previous lives.

<p>
	I have become conscious that there is no such thing as lives, past or present.

<p>
	Past lives are imaginary.

Please explain.

<p>
	When did I say that consciousness is imaginary? I never said that.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the one substance of reality. Consciousness imagines all things. But that doesn't mean consciousness itself is imagined.

	Psychedelics are not about escaping the present. They are about accessing higher consciousness than humanly possible.

<p>
	You will never, ever naturally access the kind of consciousness that 5-MeO-DMT can give you. Not even with 40 years of practice.

<p>
	Awakening is such a radical thing that you simply cannot treat it like any other domain of human knowledge. It is not knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine becoming God, becoming conscious of how time, space, Earth, the body, life, death, and mathematics was invented. Imagine you become conscious of how you designed Hitler. That's what we're talking about. It is not a human function at all. Your life as a human comes to an end.
</p>

<p>
	It comes from pure consciousness. Where does the fact that you exist come from?

<p>
	That's the ultimate mindfuck: there is no death, there is no end. You are imagining an end. This moment and this room are Eternal and exist forever.

<p>
	Death is just complete Awakening and dissolution into Infinite Love for forever. It is not blankness or void. It is Total Awakeness forever.

	Infinite Love is what I am guiding you to. It will all resolve in Infinite Love. But you cannot reach Love through emotions and other human tricks. Love requires cracking the illusion of reality and deconstructing life.

			Obviously you're saying everything is imaginary. My question to you is, by using difference phrasing, is the chakra system fictional? Does it actually exist? i.e. is real in the same way this "table" in front of me is real, like it's an existing structure. I've had strong experiences with my third eye having sensations, or if I'm doing spinal breathing I will interpret there to be energy spots on my spine. What makes this tricky however is the fact this spinal breathing is a visualisation exercise of imagining prana moving up the spine, so my mind can be seeing what it wants to see or my mind rather will change my bodily sensations to match my visualisations ( I need to experiment with this a lot more than I currently am). <br />
			<br />
			So does this structure called the chakra system exist? If it is true that (adding the phrase "If it is true that" because I don't want to pretend like I've directly experienced this) I imagine my nervous system to have an impact on my consciousness. The spine being a part of the nervous system, it is of energetic significance? I'm not ultimately concerned with rationalising it as nervous system or as this or that tbh, I'm just curious what you think about this entire concept of chakra system.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To me it's obvious that chakras are imaginary. BUT! So is the Earth. So... just because it is imaginary doesn't mean you can't use it. The whole point of yoga is to imagine those things and use that to prop yourself up. So I'm not saying it doesn't work.

	It's far more radical than you guys are thinking. You are still treating Awakening as solipsism. It is not! It is God! And what is God? You don't know since you ain't Awake yet.

<p>
	Awakening is not a theory.
</p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	It's not merely that materialism can't explain things. It's fundamentally a total delusion.
</p>

<p>
	You were never born and science is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Not as a theory. Actually!
</p>

<p>
	Your birth is the theory.
</p>

<p>
	Open your mind to the possibilty of direct access to Absolute Truth.

	If you aware of it, then obviously it exists then. But as soon as you're not aware of it, it doesn't exist.

<p>
	You have no asshole until you think you do.

<p>

	No! You imagine that.

	And there is no US, only YOU!

			So this limited figure on the canvas did not create the corona virus, the canvas (absolute God) did it. So the canvas creates a limited figure with other limited figures and corona and they dont know about corona virus. But god knows and experience every little corona virus therefore corona exists outside of limited figures at the same time. Right?

<p>
	No, for fuck's sake man, there is nothing outside the present moment. This bubble of the room you're in is ALL THERE IS.
</p>

<p>
	It's stupidly simple. Yet you keep trying to imagine some hidden mechanism. God is not anything but the room you are in.

			I still dont have any experience with psychedelics, Can these substances have any help in this process (Samyama)?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, they can help a lot.
</p>

<p>
	But they will not automagically still your mind. That requires years of training.
</p>

<p>
	But a psychedelic will definitely put you into a effortless yet temporary state of samadhi. This is the whole point of psychedelics. They make samadhi accessible to anyone within 10 to 20 mins. Zero training required.
</p>

<p>
	Will you keep the samadhi? No. It will wear off.
</p>

<p>
	I have never done it, but in theory yes, if you did it seriously.

<p>
	That's the whole trick, I think. You become so conscious that you can blur those lines at will.
</p>

<p>
	Again, I am nowhere near mastering this. I'm talking how it might theoretically work.
</p>

<p>
	I think it's possible. But very rare in practice.

		<p>
			Would your best friend sitting next to you Jump back and say, "woah!" or will his eyes gaze straight past, staring at the opposite wall?

</blockquote>

<p>
	If we are talking about manifestation of physical objects, then your friend should be able to see it. Or at least you will imagine that he does. Since your friend is imaginary to begin with.

<p>
	God is like an empty canvas on which all form is painted. Your true nature is that entire canvas. But right now you only know yourself to be a figure drawn on the canvas.
