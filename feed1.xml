			I think we can expect gun culture to change. But it will take maybe a century or so.

<p>
	In the long term, yes, gun culture must change. But it's not just gun culture, it's also the alienation and various radical ideologies which much change.
</p>

<p>
	And also notice, in your slavery example, how much blood had to be spilled for that to change. Culture always changes, but not without a fight. Which is precisely what we're seeing today in the news. The transition from Blue/Orange to Green will involve violent resistance.

		<p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not about words or semantics. There is a distinct facet to awakening that is the realization of Absolute Love. This is a facet that you simply have not yet become conscious of. You might be conscious of the Self, or of Truth, or of Infinite Consciousness, but you are not conscious that the Self and Truth and Consciousness are Love. Or that the purpose of all Creation is Love.
</p>

<p>
	That word Love rings hollow to your hears because you lack a reference experience for it. This can only be solved through a deep awakening into the existential nature of Love.
</p>

<p>
	What teachers? How about the guy in my signature. Ever read his work?

			Don't you think having so many guns on a private level is creating this problem? And as far as i know, most of the advance countries do not allow this in their own country.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, it is definitely creating a problem. But that's not the question. The question, how do you fix it?
</p>

<p>
	It's easy in other countries because you guys have never had a Wild West gun culture. It's like trying to ban pickup trucks in Europe. That would be very easy because they are basically non-existent. But how do you ban 300 million firearms?
</p>

<p>
	Just because you ban something does not mean people stop using it. If only it were so easy.
</p>

<p>
	To truly fix this problem requires changing the culture. Which is analogous to asking Japanese people to stop eating fish. Good luck with that. They won't even stop hunting whales. Because it's in their culture.
</p>

<p>
	By your attitude it is clear that you are not awake to what Love is.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate: What is Love? until it kills you, until you drown in it. Only then will your awakening be complete.

<p>
	No, you have a utopian picture of Chinese spirituality. Daoism is non-existent there in practice.

<p>
	China is not really anti-American. They are even more rabidly materialistic than America.
</p>

<p>
	They are not just going to skip from stage Blue to Green. They will go through all the mistakes and pathologies that America went through. But it will take them even longer because at least America had free speech, freedom of religion, and democratic elections from day 1. It will take China 50-100 years to sort that out.

<p>
	I doubt it would help. He's too far gone. His ego will probably co-op any mystical insights and make him an even bigger devil. After Hitler was nearly assassinated by a bomb blast, he rationalized it to himself that God saved his life so that he could fulfill his mission of exterminating the Jews. How do you cure someone like that? His mind was way too radicalized with ideology.

<p>
	If there was a practical way to save him, I'd be for it.

<p>
	I think I still support the death penalty for certain criminals. Some people you just can't reform. Someone like Hitler you execute.

<p>

<p>
	China is not more spiritually advanced. China is stage Blue, just starting to move into Orange. They have massive growing pains ahead of them. China is becoming extremely materialistic and will face all the same problems America has been facing for the last 50 years. They have serious systemic corruption which will take them 50+ years to cleanse out.
</p>

<p>
	China will not be Green for another 50 years at least. They haven't even figured out how to let their people vote. America is far more developed and conscious than China. The Chinese are still ethnically cleansing certain provinces in western China.

It just doesn't make sense to pay that.
</p>

<p>
	The point of Medicare For All is that it would have the leverage necessary to significantly negotiate down the costs of healthcare. Right now the system is way more expensive than it needs to be because of the private health insurance middleman. This middleman makes a huge profit while providing very little value and actually adding negative value with all the byzantine paperwork.

	This is not a systemic solution.
</p>

<p>
	If your solution is have people save up money to pay for $100,000 surgeries and cancer treatments, that will result in the unnecessary deaths and suffering of millions of people.
</p>

<p>
	Don't then be surprised when some depressed, angry guy walks into a school and shoots your child in the face. All because that guy is pissed off that his child died of a cancer which he didn't have the money to treat.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, everything is connected in society. What goes around comes around. If you treat people like animals they will act like animals.
</p>

<p>
	If your own mother was hungry, would you let her starve on the streets? If you own mother broke her leg in the woods, would you leave her out there by herself to fight off the wolves? Why do you take that attitude towards others in desperate need?

Folks with psychic abilities usually experience voices and things of that sort, which they can find overwhelming at first until they learn how to manage it.
</p>

<p>
	This is sorta the shaman's path. The important thing is not to misinterpret this as going crazy or as something that's wrong. You should try to see it as a blessing in disguise, a gift. But you'll have to go through some inner turmoil to fully realize how to make use of this gift for the greater good of mankind. It's a journey of self-discovery. You are discovering hidden aspects of yourself and reality. Don't expect to fit in with mainstream folks. Try to find some shamans or others with these kinds of psychic or paranormal abilities. They would be in the best position to guide you and give you advice. Personally I never experience that kind of stuff, but I know it's a real thing.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that you are developing schizophrenia. Rather your mind is opening up to new dimensions of reality which are not yet recognized by mainstream culture. Become curious about these new dimensions. They might be worth exploring.
</p>

<p>
	This is exactly what the right-wingers foresee and the reason they get so defensive and don't allow any gun laws whatsoever. They see it as a slippery slope which will eventually lead to the ban of even handguns.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest fear of right-wingers is that liberals will take away all their guns through a gradual series of bans.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, we have a 2nd Amendment here:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	So you cannot ban all firearms without a Constitutional Amendment, which requires 3/4ths of all states to agree. This is highly unrealistic.
</p>

<p>
	I propose a compromise where liberals guarantee that handguns and hunting rifles will not be banned, in return for sensible gun control. But see, right-wingers won't even agree to that because they will think it's just a ploy with further bans to come (as your strategy suggests).
</p>

<p>
	In the very long term (perhaps 100 years), I agree that many kinds of firearms will probably end up banned. But not without a fight. The right-wingers understand this, so they are already digging in their heels.
</p>

	Bernie will not be able to pass Medical For All with winning the Senate and also massive popular support from the people. His whole strategy is to lead a cultural movement to get it done. It won't be easy and he knows that. It needs to become a cultural movement along the lines of Civil Rights in the 60's.
</p>

<p>
	The health insurance industry will throw hundreds of millions of dollars to stop Bernie if he starts to get close. They will fight this thing to the bitter end. The devilry will get shameless because that industry will be fighting for its life like a cornered racoon.

<p>
	I actually don't see this as a big problem. We've already had weapons of mass destruction technology for a long time. It is very strictly regulated and so no citizens can realistically access it.
</p>

<p>
	You can't access rocket launchers, flame throwers, grenades, chemical weapons, land mines, etc. That stuff is so dangerous even the most extreme gun advocates are not foolish enough to suggest that people have a right to own rocket launchers.
</p>

<p>
	Really, the trickiest case is hand guns. Because on the one hand they are very reasonable to own. But on the other hand, they are still very lethal and can cause a mass shooting when in the wrong hands. How do you regulate that? That's a very tricky balance.
</p>

<p>
	I would like to see mandatory gun safety training courses for anyone who wants to own a firearm. Similar to getting a driver's license. But of course this still won't be enough to stop mass shootings.

	Realistically you cannot get rid of handguns, shotguns, and hunting rifles. And those alone are enough to create many mass shootings.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, we can have better background checks and ban assault rifles, but a handgun is enough to kill 10-20 people. Handguns are NOT going away.
</p>

<p>
	So this problem needs to be addressed at a deeper, cultural level.
</p>

<p>
	If only it was as simple as banning guns.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to understand is that American culture is big on hunting and guns. You have to take this into account. You can't just compare America to Europe or Japan because our cultures are different. Americans will not ban handguns. And even if we did, millions of people would just own them illegally because they would disagree with the spirit of the ban. It would be like banning weed or alcohol. You can't ban something which millions of people think is reasonable to own.
</p>

<p>
	Banning handguns would be as unrealistic as banning cars. Responsible gun owners will get understandably very upset when you penalize them for the actions of a handful of extremists. There are 10s of millions of responsible gun owners. Try to imagine how you'd feel if some kid shot up a school after playing Grand Theft Auto, so then we ban all Grand Theft Auto games. Millions of decent Grand Theft Auto players would be pissed because out of 10 million players there is bound to be one extremist.
</p>

<p>
	The reason the problem of mass shooting hasn't been resolved is because it's a very tricky problem.
</p>

<p>
	Even if the Democrats succeed in passing strict gun regulation, I still predict mass shootings will continue to happen. So what then? How do you solve that?
</p>

I looked at Japan and I was kind of surprised. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It's not like I think, that Japan is an undeveloped country, but it is indeed a very tricky one. I've spoken to many Japanese people and I have the feeling that they are trying to make everything look perfect, but their picture of perfection is very blue/orange. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I think that their collective ego is much stronger than in other countries, they are hiding so many things, they have issues with thinking independently. You can see how this causes them to have one of the highest suicide rates in the world.
		</p>

		<p>
			What do you think about this?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, that's mostly just classic stage Blue/Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Japan is very ethnically isolated and monocultural. They don't have much diversity. They tend to be either very old school and traditional, or modern and materialistic. They work themselves to death and they are extremely conformist. Stage Orange and stage Blue qualities.
</p>

<p>
	Japan might develop faster if they had more cultural and racial diversity. Without that diversity it becomes like inbreeding, an echo chamber of the same old ideas with not enough cross-pollination or people challenging the accepted paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Highly diverse places (like big cosmopolitan cities) are forced to be progressive and innovative. Which is why rural areas tend to be so backwards and deeply stage Blue. Stage Blue can only be maintained through lack of multiculturalism. Which is why conservatives tend to hate multiculturalism. They view it as an evil. Because they want to be monocultural. Multiculturalism makes them scared and uncomfortable because it threatens to erode their simplistic nationalist identities.
</p>

<p>
	Japanese culture values politeness over truth. This is problematic. And yeah, that leads to hiding serious issues under a fake veneer of politeness and deference.
</p>

<p>
	Their suicide rates demonstrate the limitations of unchecked materialism. If you run materialism to the hilt, what you'll get is depression and suicidal thoughts as you realize that no amount of material success leads to happiness, but you won't know any alternative (because materialism denies spirituality). So the only way out becomes suicide.
</p>

<p>
	Our materialist culture doesn't properly teach people that the solution to depression and suicide is genuine spiritual practice. So yes, suicide, alienation, and depression in materialistic cultures will skyrocket until the lesson is learned.
</p>

So it's only usable if I have a serious illness/surgery. And under this plan, my choice of doctors is extremely limited. My insurance does not cover my favorite doctors. I have to go to the worst doctors in town if I want insurance to cover it. Otherwise I'd need a much more expensive insurance plan.
</p>

<p>
	This makes preventative care very hard.
</p>

<p>
	The system is not designed to help sick people, it is designed to exploit the sick.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not fantastic even if you have money.
</p>

<p>
	I am considered upper class. I buy my own health insurance. It still sucks. It's very expensive, deductibles are very high, and the paperwork is so complex and full of so many scams and loopholes that if I had a serious health issue it would be nightmare to deal with. I basically pay for it but never use it. I pay for all my medicine and basic doctors visits cash, out of pocket just to avoid dealing with all the limitations and hassles of my insurance.
</p>

<p>
	This winter I went for a couple of doctors visits for a common cold/flu. I was supposed to pay like $50 co-pays and that's it. Then 3 months later they send me a bill for $300 more that I supposedly owe them. Yet none of these costs/fees were told to me upfront. That's how the system is deliberately designed to work. No costs are fairly announced. The system is so byzantine and opaque by design so that they could charge you any ridiculous fees they want. No other industry works this way. It's totally corrupt and needs to be nuked from on high.
</p>

<p>
	And I'm not even talking about the thousands of people who die every year due to lack of coverage. But the hassles of dealing with all the paperwork alone is enough to warrant nuking the system. It's absurdly inefficient.
</p>

<p>
	Meanwhile in Canada you can just go to the doctor for a surgery and pay nothing out of pocket. And no absurd paperwork.
</p>

			You need to be extra careful if that's the way you're going to place your stones. There is a huge difference between relying on individual subjectivity and the struggle to build something based on consensual subjectivity. I don't intend to discuss this point here. I'm just saying that arguing that the scientific method arises from subjectivity won't quite cut it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Keep in mind that the most refined scientists do not confuse science with Truth. So if you say that to them as an attempt to wake them up to the spiritual dimension it won't even scratch their surface.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can't avoid the truth of the matter.
</p>

<p>
	What the scientist needs to realize is that all science is mediated through subjective experience and that it could not be otherwise. To skip over this point is the crux of problem. This is a giant epistemic oversight on their part.
</p>

<p>
	The subjectivity of science is the elephant in the room that no scientist wants to acknowledge.
</p>

<p>
	The very belief that science is objective is itself a subjective belief! Science is objective because one imagines it to be so.

<title>Dealing With The Two Mass Shootings</title>

<p>
	These shootings are an expected phenomena of a hyper materialistic society. As stage Orange runs its course, the limitations of Blue/Orange will become more and more apparent in the form of these kinds of ego backlashes. But this shines collective awareness on the problem, which will ultimately lead to its resolution and a transition into a stage Green society.
</p>

<p>
	Banning guns will not be enough to resolve this. What's necessary is to make society more fair and to provide more opportunities and social support for alienated people.
</p>

<p>
	It's an alienation problem. Alienated, nihilistic, depressed, angry, impoverished, poorly-socialized, and sexually frustrated people adopt radical and violent ideologies. Same as in the Middle East.
</p>

<p>
	As stage Orange becomes more and more excessive and unhealthy, alienation will increase, violence and radicalism will increase.
</p>

<p>
	When people lack a proper spiritual connection to life, they become hopeless and turn to drugs, sex, exploitation of others, and nationalist ideologies.
</p>

<p>
	This is why it's important to foster a sense of community and to help those who are in bad shape. Because if they are not helped, they will not simply suffer silently by themselves, they will lash out at the world. These shootings are really a cry for help. Society is failing not only the victims of these shootings, but the shooters especially. The shooters are lashing out because they don't have proper channels for getting the love they want in healthy ways.
</p>

<p>
	And of course Trump is pouring gasoline on this problem because he epitomizes toxic Orange while goading on Blue and demonizing Green.
</p>

I definitely understand why that's important, especially looking at how Donald Trump appealed to that way of thinking with his "Make America Great Again". Yet, learning from the past is not only done by looking back at our mistakes, but by looking at people and society's greatest successes.

<p>
	Generally speaking, if mood goes up, it must come down. And since its all relative, you will perceive any drop in mood from its peak as a terrible thing.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind cannot evaluate absolute values of mood, only relative changes. So to jump from 50 to 100 and then back down to 50 is perceived the same as dropping from 50 to 0.

</p>

<p>
	Trump's wealth is a total con. But stage Orange doesn't care. To stage Orange, the appearance of wealth is as valid as actual wealth and it doesn't matter to stage Orange that his wealth was acquired through white collar crime and various kinds of exploitative schemes. Stage Orange just wants that golden toilet, damn the costs.
</p>

<p>
	To stage Orange, success = truth.

<p>
	That's totally predictable. Stage Orange is attracted to Trump's phony materialistic success, his phony business acumen, his phony masculinity, his vulgarity, and his giving an F.U. to stage Green.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarian types are attracted to that like flies to shit.
</p>

<p>
	I had a stage Orange coaching client about 3 years ago and he looked up to Trump as his role-model. When I asked him why, he said because Trump has a beautiful wife, the kind of trophy wife he'd like to have. This reveals the level of depth of stage Orange minds.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Orange does not understand the shallowness and self-defeating nature of materialism and capitalism. Stage Orange has made materialism its God. Sports cars, luxury condos, hot women, and millions of dollars are their vision of heaven.

<p>
	Yes, I have, but all of that takes precious time and energy that I could put towards shooting more videos, creating more courses, and writing books.
</p>

<p>
	I might do some of those things in the future, but it's not a high priority.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with meeting people in person is that it's a lot of hassle and my reach becomes very small.

<p>
	Not quite. Enlightenment is the recontextualization of "experience" into Being/Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The raw data of perception doesn't change, it just gets recontextualized, reinterpreted.
</p>

<p>
	So your coffee table still looks like a coffee table but it is no longer a coffee table, it is recognized to be the mind of God.

<p>
	Haha
</p>

<p>
	Let me rephrase your question back to you in a way that you can relate to:
</p>

<p>
	Aren't scientific experiments based on what we're interested in? So if a serious scientist makes a discovery in the lab, and some kid is just dicking around in the lab and simply gets a fun, erroneous result, isn't that proof that science happens BECAUSE of us, and not TO US?

<title>Why is Self Conscious a Demeaning Adjective?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/37840-why-is-self-conscious-a-demeaning-adjective/?do=findComment&amp;comment=473831</link>

<p>
	You just have to be careful with how terms can have different meanings.
</p>

<p>
	"Self-consciousness" is a mainstream cultural term, not a technical term from spirituality. Mainstream culture does not understand what the self or what consciousness is. So understanding that, when ordinary folks say "self-conscious" they are not talking about spirituality or awakening or Truth. They simply mean: a neurotic sense of social anxiety and self-judgment.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be fooled by the surface similarity of terms. Just because two words look the same or sound the same does not mean they have the same meaning.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the problem is not self-consciousness per se, the problem is an obsessive anxiety over one's self-image in social situations. In a sense, the awakened person is not self-conscious when he acts. He's not thinking of his self-image, he acts spontaneously. The self-conscious person self-obsesses and is stuck in monkey mind.
</p>

	Same as how Trumpists defend Trump. Rather than admitting Trump's ignorance they explain it away as actually a higher level of intelligence and strategy.

	Stage Blue is prone to mythological thinking. They tend to take myths literally.

	Because I'd have a hard time finding anyone who would understand or appreciate the depth of the things I want to say, so I just focus on buliding my body of work.
</p>

<p>
	The stuff I want to say will only be understood by one in a million people. Who is gonna interview me? Who knows which questions to ask? How many hours would the interview need to be to convey the things I want conveyed?
</p>

<p>
	It would largely be a waste of my time.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than waiting for the right person to ask me things, I just say the right things straight to your face and cut out the middle man.

<p>
	That's his defense mechanism for surviving as the self that he's attached to. That is the function of such emotional reactions.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a baby crying when you take away his favorite blanket.
</p>

<p>
	To your friend, losing his national identity is scary and painful so he's in denial about it because it would seriously threaten his entire worldview. He might have to admit that Islam is not the one true faith. This would lead to a profound existential crisis as he loses his grip on reality.
</p>

<p>
	The mind cannot admit that reality is self-constructed. It needs reality to be objectively real!

<p>
	Understanding and insight goes way deeper than ego or langauge.
</p>

<p>
	Eliminating internal dialogue is not necessary for awakening or insight. You can be going through an awakening and still have access to some internal dialogue which comments on and makes sense of what is happening. An ego self is not required for this.
</p>

<p>
	After an awakening it can be a good practice to sit down and write out what happened to you. This is not ego. This is a good way to clarify things in your mind. It's not enough to just have awakening experience, you also have to then purify the mind. The mind needs to upgrade its logical understanding of itself so it can communicate about these things better. All of this is part of the awakening process.
</p>

<p>
	It is certainly possible to have an awakening but then return to a muddled and confused mind which misunderstands what just happened to it.
</p>

<p>
	You have to grow your mind along with your consciousness.
</p>

	One day Mohammed saw a Bedouin leaving his camel without tethering it, questioned him as to why he was doing this. The Bedouin replied that he was placing his trust in Allah and had no need to tie the camel. The prophet Mohammed then replied, “Tie your camel and place your trust in Allah.”
</p>

<p>

<p>
	It cannot be told to you in words.
</p>

<p>
	I understand your skepticism, but all happenings truly are an expression of Love. It's too epic to believe. Even when you awaken to it you will be too amazed to accept it. It's too good to be true. Yet it is Truth itself.
</p>

	Psychedelics help. Take some DPT and ask it to show what is Love. Brace yourself for a mindfucking of unspeakable proportions.

	Your awakening is not complete until you understand why you created it all. It will melt your heart with pure Goodness. It is a Goodness without an opposite.

	Your fantasies about how oneness must be is getting in the way of realizing how oneness actually is.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness includes twoness and all the rest.
</p>

<p>
	I doesn't make sense because you're not awake. If it made sense, you'd already be awake and we wouldn't need to have this conversation.

<p>
	A dark room retreat requires 24/7 darkness.
</p>

<p>
	People have done 30 day dark room retreats. Of course not solo. They had help from outsiders.

<p>
	This is simply the dualistic nature of language & distinction.
</p>

<p>
	See my 3 part series about Understanding Duality, where stuff like this was resolved in great detail.
</p>

<p>
	"Spirituality" is used in two senses: relative and absolute. In the absolute sense, everything is Spirit. But in the relative sense we make a distinction between those who are conscious of Spirit and those who are not (the materialists). So even though a materialistic scientist is studying Spirit in this lab when he is doing his chemistry experiments, he isn't conscious that chemicals are Spirit. And so we say he isn't being spiritual. He has mistaken Spirit for matter.
</p>

<p>
	It is like that man who mistook a coiled rope in a dimly lit room for a snake.

<p>
	You can't understand it without awakening. And it's too radical to explain to you verbally.
</p>

<p>
	You have to stop being a self to understand it. Your self-hood is getting in the way.
</p>

<p>
	Self-hood is the illusion. There simply isn't no such thing as a self. It's being imagined.
</p>

<p>
	What I'm telling you is: your birth is imaginary. You were never actually born, you simply believe you were.

<p>
	Fruits and nuts will not be enough to sustain you. You will be extremely hungry and quit.
</p>

<p>
	It would be more reasonable to light-proof an entire bedroom plus attached bathroom, so you have more space to move around, sleep, and store food.
</p>

<p>
	Right now I pretty much sleep in a pitch black light-proofed bedroom. All the windows and even the door is totally blocked with special thick curtains.
</p>

<p>
	That would be the way to go about it.
</p>

<p>
	Logistical planning for retreats is very important. You need to address all practical issues ahead of time so you can fully focus on the retreat without distraction.
</p>

<p>
	You could even install a small fridge in your bedroom to hold pre-cut fruits, sandwiches, pasta salad, etc. You could stock up on beef jerky.
</p>

	You police the government with your vote and political activism. By being a good citizen. That is democracy. If you shirk that responsibility then we get an oligarchy or monarchy. But then you will start to bitch and moan about being oppressed. But it was your apathy which allowed the oppression.

<p>
	Serious liberals are all about reducing systemic corruption.
</p>

<p>
	"Small government" does not solve the corruption problem, it simply outsources the corruption to cartels and giant corporations where they have zero accountability to the people.
</p>

<p>
	Corruption is not a government problem. Corruption is an ego problem. Devilry will happen through all possible mediums, public and private alike.

<title>Objections To Spirituality Mega-Thread</title>

<p>
	I want your help.
</p>

<p>
	As I do research for my book, I want to gather a potent collection of objections to spirituality, nonduality, enlightenment, mysticism, the paranormal, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I want legit objections that newbies and skeptics commonly have in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some examples to get you thinking along the right lines:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		How can you trust that a subjective experience reveals Absolute Truth?
	</li>
	<li>
		Isn't awakening just a subjective brain phenomenon?
	</li>
	<li>
		Could awakening be a self-deception?
	</li>
	<li>
		Is it possible that there's something beyond Absolute Truth which you could be missing?
	</li>
	<li>
		How is awakening different from solipsism?
	</li>
	<li>
		How is awakening different from nihilism?
	</li>
	<li>
		How is awakening different from pantheism?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do awakened people still commit evil acts like sexually abusing their students?
	</li>
	<li>
		If God is real, why would God hide himself from people? Why isn't God evident to all people in the same way that the sun is?
	</li>
	<li>
		If awakening is true, why do all the religions disagree so much?
	</li>
	<li>
		You say reality is infinite, but doesn't quantum mechanics say there is a fundamental lower limit to space known as the Planck Length?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why is love, beauty, goodness, and intelligence a fundamental property of the universe but hate, ugliness, evil, and stupidity are not?
	</li>
	<li>
		If God is so loving why would he allow so much evil in the world like rape, torture, genocide, war, etc?
	</li>
	<li>
		How can you trust psychedelics reveal valid truths and aren't just subjective hallucinations?
	</li>
	<li>
		If science is as wrong about the fundamental metaphysics of reality as you say, how come it's so successful at manipulating reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why couldn't there be more than one God?
	</li>
	<li>
		If physical reality is imaginary, why can't I imagine a million dollars into my bank account or imagine away a physical illness?
	</li>
	<li>
		If what you say is true, how come serious scientists aren't talking about it? Where is your Nobel prize?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I want stuff like that in this thread.
</p>

<p>
	Note: I won't necessarily resolve your objections in this thread. I'm simply trying to gather a solid list of them.
</p>

<p>
	Please formulate your question/objection clearly and concisely.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If you try to reduce meditation to numbers like that, you'll end up shooting yourself in the foot, as you will overlook the most important aspect: quality.
</p>

<p>
	10 minutes of quality meditation is worth more than 10 hours of poor meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Be very careful about pursuing consciousness mechanically or numerically.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Sorry, I don't buy that.
</p>

<p>
	As our environment changes due to technological advancements, the human will be less and less suitable and require further evolution. It's already happening. Natural selection is always culling those who aren't adapting to an ever changing environment. And our environment is changing faster than ever.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as the peak of evolution. Evolution is relative to environment. If you move to Mars, you ain't gonna be at your peak. And humans on Mars will evolve accordingly. The geometry of the solar system doesn't need to change for this to occur. Evolution never stops or peaks out. It is relentlessly ongoing every second of every day.

</p>

<p>
	But for that to work you have to be willing to open your mind beyond what you presently know. And you have to be willing to take such existential question as "Why is reality the way it is?" seriously.
</p>

	If you believe the question isn't worthwhile to contemplate, then you will get no answer and you will not even know what treasures you missed.

	It's like there's a pile of flawless diamonds buried under your bed but you are too incredulous to get a shovel and dig under your bed. I'm telling you guys there's a pile of diamonds here which you have not yet discovered.

Yes, I believe the enlightenment is the way to overcome this fear. I've started meditating 1 hour a day and i seem to be becoming more calm and focused than before. If i do this long enough, let's say 1 year, will it get me a taste of what enlightenment is like? What is the minimum requirement of meditation, self-inquiry, and trip for awakening?

<p>
	There is no formula for awakening. You will only awaken if you awaken. No process can guarantee it.
</p>

<p>
	Judging from my own experience, 1 hour per day is not nearly enough. But it's not a function of brute time, it's a function of effort and quality of concentration.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about awakening, you should be doing week-long meditation retreats at least twice a year. And/or psychedelics and/or Kriya yoga.
</p>
