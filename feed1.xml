Too early to tell yet, but I'm optimistic.
</p>

<p>
	I take it without anything on most days, but also with DMSA + ALA when I am detoxing specifically.

<p>
	You don't need to be programmer to do game dev. There are many other roles:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Producer
	</li>
	<li>
		Designer
	</li>
	<li>
		Level design
	</li>
	<li>
		Art
	</li>
	<li>
		Audio
	</li>
	<li>
		PR/marketing/sales
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The way to break into games is simple: you work on your own little projects, building up skills, and developing a solid, polished portfolio which you then show off to employers. Attending game's conferences like GDC and networking with your portfolio in-hand can open many doors.
</p>

<p>
	Starting game design is easier than ever today thanks to powerful and cheap tools like Unity, Unreal, or many of the modding toolkits like that of Skyrim, Fallout, or other games.
</p>

<p>
	One of the easiest ways to get hired is to create a solid and popular mod for a popular game like Fallout/Skyrim. As new games are released, start modding them and posting your work for fans to give you feedback and reviews. Designing board games or pen and paper games is also a good way to build up your design skills.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, as long as you have the skills and can demonstrate them, you will get hired. The trick is developing the skills. This requires some years of committed work and a plan.
</p>

<p>
	I could write an entire course on how to become a top notch game designer and get hired by the best studios.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There's no way forward in life so long as your mind is full of those recirculating toxic beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	I had to do a lot of busting of my limiting beliefs when I was starting out in this work.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, your potential in life is so monstrously huge that your mind will not believe it is real. It sounds too much like a pipe dream. The mind needs to be whipped into opening itself.
</p>

	Heavy metal toxicity
</p>

<p>
	You can try doing detox
</p>

<p>
	After detox I went from sleeping 9 hours and feeling tired to sleeping 6.5-7 hours and feeling energetic. It can make a huge difference.

<p>
	That's what happens when you start to self-actualize. You see more and more how much time and potential you squandered by doing other useless shit like a monkey.
</p>

<p>
	That deep regret is a sign of you becoming more conscious. Most people are so asleep they never even know what they missed. They live and die in blissful ignorance.
</p>

Knowing how to flirt and charm a girl will not help you in other areas of your life much. Confidence humor and not being a wimp will though
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course it's both.
</p>

<p>
	There are many technical aspects of game if you want to get really good. But there are also general principles of being more attractive and high value as a man. Ideally you master both.
</p>

<p>
	No amount of high value will help you if you cannot do such a simple technical feat as open your mouth and talk to girl you've never met before, and do it in a charming, non-creepy, non-panicked way.

<p>
	It's gonna be very tough to fine client unless you have connections within the self-help industry.
</p>

<p>
	That can be a long-term goal of yours, but I don't see how it will be immediately viable because people who need self-help websites is very narrow and specialized. How you gonna find such people. You need a lead-building strategy for that to work.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to niche in web development, I would look for a niche which is lucrative and has lots of demand. Like e-commerce or the like. This way you can bootstrap your biz. Later you can try to transition it to self-help if that's your jazz.

			Are you sure about that? Here are some examples of things that happened to me in the past few months:<br />
			Â 
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Have been going to a sort of stage green connection building / spirituality events that used to be held in my city every week pre - covid. Never went there with any intention other than to enjoy myself, nor have I ever deliberately "tried" to get a girl from there. Ended up in bed with 5 different girls I've met there.
			</li>
			<li>
				Went to a riverside campfire party a friend invited me to, about 10 people. As it ended and everyone was about to leave, I've asked if I could crash at anyone's place for the night. One girl invited me over. We have talked for a bit during the party and got along pretty well, but it wasn't particularly remarkable or even flirty, just some friendly chats. While on the way to her place, we have been talking a bit more, just a friendly conversation, not flirty or sexy in any way. After we arrived at her place, we laid down in bed next to each other. We started cuddling for a bit, 5 minutes fast forward, and we started to have amazing sex
			</li>
			<li>
				I am a member of a Facebook Self-help group for people who are trying to start a spiritual business. Members regularly connect with each other to help each other out in their business-building and personal growth processes. Had a video call with another female member of the group. Guess what happened 2 weeks later.
			</li>
			<li>
				Member of another Facebook Self-help group for dealing with specific emotional issues. Same story.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			At this point, I don't even care about getting girls at all anymore. They just keep stumbeling into my life unexpectedly every now and then, without me having to put any efford into it.Â <br />
			<br />
			But it haven't always been like that. I used to be extremely shy, and was only able to talk to girls at all whilst drunk, and was very depressed about that fact.Â <br />
			Well I've startet trying to improve in that for a little while. I've watched some of yours and other peoples videos, and I went to two workshops. A little bit of improvement happened, but not to the degree where I was even remotely satisfied.<br />
			<br />
			Then what happened is, I did some mushrooms and became conscious of the fact that me desperately wanting to have sex all the time is only causing me pain and lots of it. SO just like that, I startet valuing my mental and emotional health more than sex. So while still having a strong desire for sex within, I just stopped caring about that desire actually getting fulfilled or not.Â <br />
			Then, the stuff mentioned above started to happen. Magic!Â <img alt="9_9" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/rolleyes.gif" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/rolleyes@2x.png 2x" title="9_9" width="20" />
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, that is a kind of action-taking
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, it seems you are fairly natural with girls. Some people have it much harder, requiring more effort. If you have above average looks and social skills, attracting girls can be effortless. But not everyone is so lucky.
</p>

<p>
	And also, don't confuse luck with skill.
</p>

<p>
	I don't need any human interfering with my inner work. It's like giving up the intimacy of sex to have sex in the parking lot with 20 people watching and giving commentary. No thanks.

<title>Is DMSA a supplement or a drug?</title>

<p>
	From what I have found, DMSA + ALA + zeolite is the best and most proven combo.
</p>

<p>
	Cilantro, chlorela, and spirulina are also said to be good, but probably not as powerful as the above.

<p>
	Which is why urine tests need to done provoked with DMSA and ALA. Then you can see how much is being pulled from your organs.
</p>

<p>
	You can do one urine test unprovoked, and a second one provoked. The difference between them will show you how much is coming out of your organs.

	But as that research link says, mercury from fish seems to not pass the blood-brain barrier. Not sure if I fully trust that. But that's what it says.

			Metal fillings contain elemental mercury. Poorly absorbed, mostly excreted and the daily dose you get is absolutely negligible compared to things like canned tuna containing high amounts of methyl-mercury. This form is readily absorbed, may even cross the blood-brain barrier and wreak havoc in your brain.Â Â 
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	This is incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	Elemental mercury is highly dangerous, more so than methyl-mercury for the brain. Methyl-mercury cannot cross the blood-brain barrier while elemental mercury can. Elemental mercury does, however, have low bio-availability if ingested. But mercury can be inhaled, not just ingested since mercury gives off fumes. Metal fillings aren't so much ingested as they give off fumes. So metal fillings are a very serious problem if you got them.

<title>Insight: Consciousness Cannot Suffer</title>

<p>
	It's more accurate to frame it as: consciousness can suffer, but it doesn't have to.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is just one of an infinite number of things that can be held within consciousness, like the color red, or a bird, or time. Consciousness can hold it, or not hold it.
</p>

<title>Trump admits on tape to downplaying Covid in March</title>

<p>
	The idea that Trumpists think Trump does anything out of altruism -- "for the good of the people" -- rather than to increase his ego, is laughable.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's only motivation, ever, is whatever most benefits him personally.
</p>

<p>
	That's far too narrow a view. To become an attractive man you shouldn't put "getting laid" as your highest priority.
</p>

<p>
	Build an attractive lifestyle which YOU are in love with. This will attract women.

<p>
	That's because I hesitate to give advice to women because, 1) I am biased in this area, 2) I don't have experience dating as a woman.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you asking a dude for lady dating advice? Ask an experienced lady.
</p>

<p>
	You can easily re-tune that list for women if you sit down and contemplate it a bit. This isn't rocket science.

<p>
	I am not talking about physical strength.
</p>

<p>
	And, sure, you can always get lucky by accident. I am talking about developing oneself in to a strong man. The benefits of this go far beyond simply getting girls.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you could get laid easily as is, you do not want to be a weak man.
</p>

<p>
	Your guys' thinking on this topic is far too narrow. As if getting laid is all that matters. What matters more is how powerful you are in the way you live your life.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't muster the courage to approach a girl, how the fuck are you gonna live a powerful life? You will be just as weak in other areas of your life.

	If your fillings are metal, you should get them replaced with ceramic before doing chelation. Otherwise you could really damage your body as chelation will move metal from your fillings into your brain and organs.

	Yes, no different than if you were a man in a conservative small town, andÂ started saying you're a woman.

	Trump is 1000% uglier in private than in public and stories of his private ugliness will leak out for decades to come. But none of it will convince Trumpists.

	By this point, any decent person understands that Trump isÂ rotten to the core and a menace to democracy.

<p>
	Nothing. It just takes some courage and confidence in yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't muster the courage to even walk up and introduce yourself, why on earth would she ever let you inside her legs? A weak guy like you doesn't deserve a hot girl.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to become a strong guy. Strong guys get hot girls.
</p>

<p>
	When you want something in life, you have to be willing to work your ass off for it. Amazing shit is not just gonna land in your lap. You must BUILD what you want. Do you want to be a strong guy? Then BUILD it! Don't ask "But how?" Just get started.

	<li>
		Building a social circle of cool and positive friends
	</li>
	<li>
		Being more social
	</li>
	<li>
		Gaining experience with women
	</li>
	<li>
		Doing pickup & cold approach
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing flirting skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving your vocal tone and body posture
	</li>
	<li>
		Going to the gym and shaping up your body
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving your diet
	</li>
	<li>
		Building an amazing life for yourself
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing amazing sexual skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing emotional connection and your feminine side
	</li>
	<li>
		Meditation & consciousness work
	</li>
	<li>
		Self-love and self-acceptance
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing misc skills such at: cooking, home repair, home defense, sewing, arts & crafts, martial arts, yoga, photography, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Becoming a good human being

	<li>
		Learning, reading, knowledge

	</li>
	<li>
		Traveling around the world
	</li>
	<li>
		And more...
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You could invest 10 years of full time work developing all that.
</p>

<p>
	None of it is necessary to get laid, but all of it ups your value.
</p>

<p>
	Bottom line: become awesome, and awesome people will gravitate towards you. Or stay lame, and lame people will gravitate towards you. But don't expect to have awesome people in your life while you're lame and too lazy to change yourself. A lazy, sloppy, victim attitude instantly makes you repulsive, since you are a value-leech, expecting something for nothing. If you want something special you must be eager to work for it.

<p>
	Of course!
</p>

<p>
	You act like this is some special handicap unique to you.
</p>

<p>
	Literally EVERY guy struggles with this. Even experienced PUAs still get approach anxiety on their first few sets of the night. That's why warm up sets are so important, and building up state.
</p>

<p>
	You really need to watch some old school RSD videos circa 2012, where all this is explained and addressed.
</p>

<p>
	There is no trick to overcoming this problem. You must do hundred of approaches by facing your fears. You will realize all your fears are illusions. But no amount of logic will resolve this. Only approaching will.
</p>

<p>
	You overcome it by realizing you're being a pussy, and by forcing yourself to approach regardless of how you feel.

<p>
	If there are 70 different genders, you can certainly choose to be whatever race you want.
</p>

	In theory, there's no reason why a white person couldn't identify with being more black than white. Rapper like Eminem comes to mind. If a white guy grows up in the hood, immersed in black culture, then he's probably more black than white at the level of the mind.

<p>
	I've done over 100 trips and feel no brain damage. My brain is working just fine. Better even, thanks to increased awareness and understanding of things.

<p>
	Don't listen to people's opinions on psychedelics unless they've done at least 100 trips.

<p>
	Exactly. Tradeoffs.
</p>

<p>
	It is every girl'sÂ dream to catch a player and lock him down.
</p>

<p>
	Well, it's playing with fire. Maybe you can lock him down, maybe you can't. Depends on what you're offering.
</p>

<p>
	Dating is a sort of market auction system where buyers and sellers have to meetÂ each other's value propositions.
</p>

<p>
	The better you make yourself the higher your bids can be. The key, as with other areas of life, is to bring massive value to the negotiating table. Then you can get what you want. But most people are too lazy to up their value. They want to leech value.

So if a guy seems too smooth to be true, how do you think he got that smooth?
</p>

<p>
	Non-player guys are gonna be more reserved, more shy, more awkward, slower, not as sexy or charming, not as charismatic, not as funny, more plain and boring.

	You're still super young and no one will care about your age. What employers care about is your demonstrable skill set and portfolio.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get hired as an artist, all you need is a great portfolio. You don't even need a degree and your age is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	All of your attention should be focused on building your skills and putting together a jaw-dropping portfolio.
</p>

<p>
	Artists get hired solely on their portfolios.

</p>

<p>
	Find what lights you up.
</p>

<p>
	A masters degree is not gonna guarantee you any jobs. To get good jobs you must build a solid portfolio and marketable skills. Not degrees.
</p>

<p>
	You can get a temporary job now while you figure out your true passions.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need an MA in economics to find a decent job.

<p>
	Being successful in your life purpose can make it much easier to meet new people through your reputation, status, expertise, celebrity, etc.

<p>
	For example, if you are a semi-successful musician or actor or public speaker, it will be very easy to get laid simply because of how visible you are.

	How often you get laid is directly proportional to how many new people are seeing you.

<p>
	It is a fact that you can be more conscious than you currently are.
</p>

<p>
	End of story.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone is in the present moment, but that doesn't mean everyone is equally conscious of it.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sick of arguing against this neo-Advaita over-simplified shit which refuses to acknowledge differences in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you are surrendered to the present moment does not mean you are deeply conscious of anything.
</p>

<p>
	What I care about is CONSCIOUSNESS, not surrender and not liberation and not freedom from suffering and not lack of ego and not some permanent condition. But CONSCIOUSNESS!
</p>

<p>
	It makes no difference to me how long it lasts or what its consequences are.

<p>
	Not really. They tend to be anti-addictive.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, if you are irresponsible, anything can be psychologically addictive. But it is not physically addictive at all and it has no withdrawal.
</p>

<p>
	Don't do anything just because you hear me talking about it. You must feel compelled to do it of your own volition, not because someone tells you to.

<p>
	No, I'm just saying that you can hook a girl whilst being a deadbeat. This happens all the time because girls don't get attracted by your money or job, they get attracted to how much you emotionally stimulate them.
</p>

<p>
	You can emotionally stimulate a girl without a job, or whilst having an amazing job. Of course having an amazing job makes you more of a long-term catch and gives you even higher value. But you can still appear high value without a job at all if you're very charismatic, for example.

<p>
	But also, adventure is not so much about money, it's more of an attitude. You can be adventurous on the cheap. You can also have millions and not be adventurous.

<p>
	All girls want to have fun and go on adventures, even if they also want stability and children.

<p>
	African tribes give their teens psychedelics like iboga. So it's not so crazy when properly supervised.

<p>
	Sounds like you're simply conscious of what God and Love are.
</p>

<p>
	God is everything that exists. Love is everything that exists.
</p>

<p>
	If it exists, it is God/Love. Hence rape is God/Love.
</p>

<p>
	Don't you find it odd that you believe that God created the universe, and yet you somehow think God didn't create rape???
</p>

<p>
	If God didn't create rape, who did?

</blockquote>

<p>
	There are many degrees of infinity.
</p>

<p>
	And they are worth accessing.
</p>

<p>
	If you are interested in Consciousness, then reaching higher degrees of infinity is something you should be interested in.
</p>

<p>
	You can discover ever deeper layers to how reality is constructed. This is not just chasing states. This is profound, life-changing stuff. This is a pursuit for those who actually care to understand how reality works at the deepest levels.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation may be one thing, but understanding is something else.

	I bet that a lot of professional women in their 30's and 40's who work boring corporate jobs but make good salaries would kill to have a player boyfriend who fucksÂ her real good and provides her an outlet to be playful and go on adventures.

<p>
	Girls just wanna have fun and feel their feminine side. Which the proper guy can do for her. That's when she falls hard in love, and he can then exploit her emotional soft spot for him.

<p>
	DARE program was not about educating truth about drugs. DARE was a program to demonize drugs and indocrinate abstinence.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between sex abstinence programs vs proper sex ed and handing out free condoms and free birth control and free STD tests. And actually teaching how to have high quality, deep sex.
</p>

<p>
	It is insane that we do not teach teens how to have high quality sex! Truly the Dark Ages.

	All identity is relative.
</p>

<p>
	But of course biology plays a huge role. You identify as human because of your biology. Although of course "human" is still a relative, imaginary, constructed identity.

<p>
	Conservatives love to play the game of agreeing to some rules and then pretending that these rules were not merely an agreement but objective reality handed down by God.

But it's also not entirely right.
</p>

<p>
	I gurantee you are nowhere close to infinitely conscious. So this thing you call "enlightenment", or just being in the present moment, is limited stuff. It's weak sauce consciousness that seems ultimate just because you know nothing higher.
</p>

<p>
	If you are incarnated as a living being, you are finite. And no amount of fancy talk about how present you are will change that.
</p>

<p>
	On your state of consciousness hinges everything. Don't go thinking you are above states. You ain't. You areÂ stuck in a state at all times. An extremely limited state.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully awoke, you would cease to exist in that body. TheÂ only reason you are here is because you don't want to be fully awake. Otherwise you'd be Infinity. And no,Â you are not Infinity, even though you are Infinity.

	Not a week straight but 3 days, yes.
</p>

<p>
	Yes it could take a year or two to fully detox depending on how severe your toxicity is. But you can feel improvements much sooner than that.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel improvements then it'a worth it.

<p>
	4-AcO-DMT is no joke. It is one of the most serious mindfucks I ever got.
</p>

<p>
	Try plugging it. You will probably get an even deeper mindfuck as it seems to metabolize differently when consumed orally.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging ensures that you stomach does not break it down into some common mushroom precursor.

	Consider the possibility, though, that she was actually helping black and brown people by pretending to be one.
</p>

<p>
	Her problem was that she cared so much it backfired.

<p>
	It's better to be a fake black person fighting for BLM vs a republican who's in denial about systemic racism. Which is why excessive Green is still better than excessive Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Being a fake black person hurts very few people compared to other ways one could be. Even if you steal 1 professorship, that's still peanuts compared to how much good you could be doing in other ways.

<p>
	You are doing it right, but this is just the early phases of self-inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	For self-inquiry to get serious, now you have to keep focusing awareness on awareness itself while quieting the mind down so it just rests on the awareness of awareness without moving. And just sit like that for as long as you can.
</p>

<p>
	It takes lots of training. The "What am I?" question should become internalized, so to speak, such that it doesn't need to verbalized non-stop. You just sit in silence and focus the awareness of awareness.
</p>

<p>
	Or just take a psychedelic.

<p>
	Being someone else's bitch can make you very miserable.

<p>
	But once you stop being someone else's bitch, life will still be difficult and full of new challenges. Now you gotta grapple with the biggest challenge of all: not being your own bitch.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This is a phony distinction. Whether a state "sticks" or doesn't is completely irrelevant from the POV of truth/reality. This is a criteria that you -- the ego-mind -- is placing upon the situation. Who says that a thing must be permanent for it to be valid or true? The mere fact that it can exist, even for 5 seconds, is enough. Nothing sticks forever. Even your so-called Buddha-level enlightenment will eventually be lost as God will fall asleep at some point after it awakens. Otherwise there wouldn't be any asleep people in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	And yes, some people do have "permanent" states which are very different than all the classical ones you know or could ever access via meditation. Your "permanent" state totally hinges on your neurology, genetics, and brain chemistry. If we tweak your brain to start pumping out new chemicals, you will be permanently living in a new reality. Well, as long as you're in that body.

	In the not too distant future we will have a Neurolink-like device which will be installed in your brain which will consistently pump out whatever cocktail of neurotransmitters you want, and you will be able to dial in your baseline state of consciousness to whatever you want. Such a device will be the most important and revolutionary technology that mankind has ever invented.

<p>
	That's only because you've talked with so few people about these issues.
</p>

<p>
	People with weird, non-classic nondual stages have no platform and no one listens to them, not even classically enlightened folk. So they are off quietly living in their own worlds while you are oblivious to their existence.

<p>
	Did you know that US law didn't recognize marital rape until the 1980s?
</p>

<p>
	Rape was literally defined as: "A man having forced sex with a woman who is not his wife."

<p>
	The relativity of language is certainly a big factor. But that's not what I'm pointing to here. I'm saying there is a vast diversity of conscious states underneath all the language difficulties, such that even if you hammer out all the language problems, you will still be left with a massive 3D terrain of diverse conscious states. And there no escape states. No matter how awake you are, you're still beholden to a state.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is so diverse than you cannot map it with a 1D or 2D model. Which is why the RASA 1000 LOC model is dumb. It's grossly reductionistic. You can't map consciousness on a 1D line or even a 2D plane.

<p>
	This is the problem with turning enlightenment into some binary thing.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "enlightenment" as a monolith. No two people have the same degree and kind of consciousness. Rather than thinking of enlightenment as a monolithic state, open your mind to the possibility that there are thousands of different states from which one can be awake. So the chances that any two people have the same degree and kind of awakening is tiny. Which is why all these nonduality debates keep happening. People assume enlightenment is a monolithic singular thing but it obviously is not if you bother to research it in some depth.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees and even different kinds of ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	You can have an ego-death so deep that you won't even be able to know your own first name. Yet most awake people can still recall their first name. That doesn't mean they aren't awake. It just means there are different kinds and degrees and states. To reduce and dismiss this vast diversity of awakening is very problematic and leads to much confusion and misunderstanding. It is a parallel problem to thinking that Christianity is the one true best religion because it happens to be the one you're familiar with. But there are many other religions which are equally valid, if not more so. But you have to be able to step outside your little self-constructed bubble in order to see it.
</p>

<p>
	People who speak of awakening/enlightenment as a singular thing have clearly not experienced anywhere near the range of consciousness that is possible. The chief characteristic of consciousness is its enormous diversity. Consciousness is infinitely diverse, beyond anything the default human mind-state can imagine. And even beyond what most enlightened humans can imagine. Just because you'd had some awakenings does not mean you understand how deep and diverse consciousness can be. No mater how awake you think you are, I guarantee you are underestimating what consciousness is capable of.
</p>

You can have awakenings and still be depressed as it takes time for the mind to integrate your new reality. The ego-mind is rarely wiped out in one fell swoop. It tends to stick around and do its egoy things.
</p>

<p>
	The early stage of realizing no-self can be especially bleak. Things brighten up once you get past that into God-realization.

<p>
	That simply means you've got more karma to burn through and lower Achiever stages to master. By all means, go for it.
</p>

<p>
	If spirituality seems like nonsense to you, then you simply aren't ready for it yet.

	Definitely don't date with a loaded gun. It makes you too needy.

<p>
	Girls will frustrate the fuck out of you with their flakiness. You can't ever rely on a girl to give you sex when you require it.

<p>
	There is never a movie in which everything goes well and everyone gets along. People pay to see people suffering through hell.

<p>
	By definition, Infinite Love Forever cannot have any form or person there. It feels a lot like if you were physically merged with every living being in the universe to the point where all of you became an undifferentiated soup of Love. It's like entering a black hole of Love from which there is no desire to return. You give up the desire to have any concrete personhood or form so that you could merge for fully with every part of the universe.
</p>

<p>
	It's like having an infinitely long, infinite intensely orgasm that is so intense that it kills the body and just keeps going forever beyond the body because the body cannot contain so much Love. It is literally an Endless Ocean of Love in which all memory of having been a human or a person is lost. That is God in its purest form. But this degree of Love is not possible for humans because they choose to be finite and separate from things.

<p>
	It's crucial that you address those root issues. Modafinil can give you focus and a mood-boost but it cannot correct for metal toxicity if you got it.
</p>

<p>
	You can start doing heavy metal chelation without many tests, and just see if you feel better from it.

Unbelievable improvements, actually.

<p>
	And I am currently testing out new chelation protocols which might be a game-changer.

<p>
	If you really want to go there permanently, just set that intention on your deathbed.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't be too much in a rush to get there. Enjoy the dream.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.
</p>

<p>
	And the grass is always greener on the other side. Once you're there, you'll want to be back here.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why you're here. To experience here. Don't take here for granted. Every corner of God is worthy of exploration.

<p>
	Your framing is wack here. You make it sound like God is a dude sitting up in the clouds clapping his hands as he observes rape.
</p>

<p>
	That's not what Love means here.
</p>

<p>
	Love is an infinite self-embrace. God loves rape because rape is an aspect of Infinity / Self. God's love of rape is simply God's love of itself. God IS rape. God IS Love.

<p>
	There are revolutionary times, but the bigger the leap forward, the bigger the ego backlash backward, so it's not necessarily a good strategy to aim for revolutions. Revolutions tend to be polarizing and they produce a lot of bluster without the solid infrastructure. I would prefer an approach that slowly builds solid infrastructure rather than just blusters.
</p>

<p>
	After the French Revolution came the counter-revolution and Napoleon. I think this is typical of how revolutions tends to unfold.

<p>
	Most awakened people are too scared to do serious multiple doses of 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	I keep suggesting they do, and they keep chickening out.
</p>

<p>
	So fear and closedmindedness are huge factors.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are simply not interested in exploring consciousness to is highest levels. Even the "awake" of often uninterested.
</p>

<p>
	But also, 5-MeO-DMT is not a magic pill. It will not leave you in a permanent state of God-consciousness. You must still do the work.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is: You can't get something unless you REALLY want it. You have to want to become God.

<p>
	Welcome to life, buddy! Where health easily deteriorates for many factors outside your control.
</p>

<p>
	Every buddha loses his health and dies at some point. It's only a question of time.

<p>
	Ramana Maharshi died of cancer.

<p>
	By your logic he was some sort of fool for getting cancer.

<p>
	They have for now. But I am working on healing myself. Health can wax and wane. Be careful with jumping to simplistic conclusions. Correlation does not equal causation. Self-development is not what caused my health problems.

<p>

<p>
	It is the truth. If it is misleading that is because people simply don't bother to understand it and do the necessary work.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not going to dumb down the truth simply because people find it misleading. The mislead is a problem in your mind which needs fixing. The truth doesn't need fixing.
</p>

<p>
	This is the ultimate truth: You are God.
</p>

<p>
	Now, your job is to realize it and handle it. I like to state the truth as plainly and directly as possible.

<p>
	Of course healing is also something we want. You can have both. And sometimes you can't. There is never a guarantee of health. Health is an extremely complex issue involving thousands of subtle factors, most of which are out of your awareness and control.
</p>

<p>
	I can work on increasing my consciousness and improving my health at the same time. And the two synergize.

<p>
	Switching your identity to that of Nothingness to the exclusion of states and fields becomes its own subtle duality.
</p>

<p>
	If you identify with being an observer of the field, that is a subtle duality still. There is 1) YOU, and 2) the field.
</p>

<p>
	YOU = FIELD
</p>

<p>
	ONENESS
</p>

<p>
	Nothing more can be said.

<p>
	You can frame it that way if you want. There are various ways of framing it.
</p>

<p>
	I make no distinction between the field and Brahman, Self and no-self.
</p>

<p>
	In the end there is only ONENESS. Slice it up however you want. People will naturally slice it up in different ways, which will cause disagreements.
</p>

<p>
	But I sometimes notice that people dismiss the important of the transparency or opaqueness of the field. Which I think is a big disservice to students. The transparency/opaqueness matters a lot in practical terms. The point of all spiritual work is to increase transparency.

<p>
	No it isn't. It's still all one consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Light is not turned into two substances by increase or decrease of intensity.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be a stickler and insist on pure, absolute, unmitigated nonduality, then you can become the Godhead itself, which is just formless infinite consciousness which increases in intensity forever without end. But at this point your human life will be gone, as will the entire material universe.

		</p>

		<p>
			I mean, I get it, it doesn't perceive as "much" as I do, but that's not the point, consciousness is not perception in the ordinary sense.Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			<br />
			It is all one consciousness,Â the greatÂ all-pervasive, all-inclusive empty awareness, it is Nothingness, how could there possibly be "a different Nothingness" ? An ant has (is) the same consciousness, the same Nothingness as I am.Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			Having realized that you are that awareness (independent of whether you've realized it or not) , what is the point in pursuing "more"? What "more" is there supposed to be? (besides strengthening one's non-dual awareness in everyday life)
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Consciousness is an infinite field which is capable of being more or less conscious of itself, more or less transparent or opaque to itself. Similar to the light in empty space. You can have very little light or you can have our sun, or something that's 1 million times brighter than our sun. All of that is the same light, but many degrees of brightness.
</p>

<p>
	An ant is definitely not conscious that it is God.
</p>

<p>
	Children are definitely not conscious that they are God.
</p>

<p>
	99.9% of adults have no consciousness of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	But you could become God-conscious. This takes some doing. It isn't your natural state. Your natural state is a state of humanness.
</p>

<p>
	This infinite field of consciousness, because it is unlimited, is capable of dialing itself down from infinity to some finite consciousness, like that of a rock. When God is dialed down to a rock, God isn't aware that it is God.
</p>

<p>
	I have seen so called "enlightened" people take 5-MeO-DMT and DMT, and it simply failed to take effect or they refused to do higher doses because they were too scared.
</p>

<p>
	It's not because they are so woke that it doesn't work on them. They simply have little desire to actually take serious doses repeatedly. They do a little test dose and then stop right there, thinking they understand what 5-MeO-DMT or DMT can offer.
</p>

<p>
	And also, these chemicals do not work on all people. Some people are simply immune. Some people simply have bad bodily reactions with no significant shift in consciousness. So when some enlightened "gym rat" tells you he's done psychedelics, it doesn't mean shit. "I've done psychedelics" is like saying "I've done math" when you have only done 1st grade arithmetic. There are many degrees of "Doing math".

<p>
	No it isn't.
</p>

<p>
	If this were true, everyone would be equally conscious and there would no point in spiritual practice. An ant would be as conscious as a human, and a child as an adult. Which is clearly not the case.
</p>

<p>
	To me, just hearing people claim that they are currently infinitely conscious is laughable. It's clear they are not even 1% conscious as they say that.
</p>

<p>
	If it seems to you like you're infinitely conscious, that's only because you're 1% conscious but have never experienced anything above that, so to you it like that you've already arrived. But in all honestly, you haven't even left the starting gate.

<p>
	You can decriminalize them all but then tightly regulate access.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously something like Fentinyl requires serious regulation, just like cyanide.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics also require reasonable regulation as people will abuse them. Low costÂ training programs areÂ necessary that teach people how to do them safely and which unsafe ones to avoid.

	Yes, you can and basically should DIY chelation, since virtuallyÂ no doctor knows how to do it for you. Only you canÂ do it effectively yourself.

<p>
	Of course enlightenment is the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	But also, there's more.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a binary. To not acknowledge degrees of wokeness is amateur stuff. And to boil enlightenment down merely to presence does a disservice to how deep consciousness can go.
</p>

<p>
	You are nowhere near infinitely conscious this present moment. But you could be.
</p>

<p>
	Infininte consciousness always occurs in the present moment, but that does not mean the present moment is infinitely conscious.
</p>

<p>
	And "guru"? Guru just means: one who guides people from darkness to the light. It's become hipÂ to use this term derisively, as if there's something wrong in guru-ing.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I don't claim to be enlightened is because I see now that there are infinite degrees of consciousness such that you could never boil them down to a simple binary on/off, enlightened/unenlightened. The question isn't, is person X enlightened? The real question is, how conscious is person X and what exactlyÂ is XÂ conscious of?

</p>

<p>
	The word has been seriously diluted by those who have no idea what awakening is.
</p>

<p>
	Transitioning from Orange or Green is nice, but it has little to do with awakening.
</p>

<p>
	To awaken is to realize you are God.
</p>

<p>
	There will not be any significant percentage of God-realized people walking this planet in our lifetime.

<p>
	I don't agree with that. I don't see evidence we are going backwards.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that going forwards is never a straight line. It's always been 2 steps forward, 1 step back.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of smooth-brained folks interpret the 1 step back as the end of the world, when really it's all part of going forward.
</p>

<p>
	Forward is a counter-intuitive thing.

<p>
	That's a hallmark of conservative ideology. Its always got a romanticized view of history. The past is always mythologized and whitewashed in grossly unrealistic and ahistorical ways. Conservatism is inherently ahistorical.
</p>

<p>
	As if 1980's, or 1970's, or 1960's, or 1950's America was ever so great. It never was. There were riots and protests and murders and wars in all those eras. And all the laws were far inferior to what they are today. But conservatives love to tell themselves that those were the good ol' days -- when lynching a blackie for looking at a white woman wasn't even considered a crime by the local sheriff.

<p>
	I was strictly a designer. Although when I worked on my own projects I would do art and coding as well.
</p>

<p>
	CD Projekt Red actually emailed me about 8 years ago asking me to join them on Witcher 3's development. But I said no because I was starting Actualized. If I had said yes, I would probably be working on Cyberpunk right now. But I have zero interest in working for anyone but myself, and certainly not in the giant meatgrinder of AAA development.

<p>
	Basically yes, although there was still content in my experience, but it was made irrelevant by my overwhelming concentration on pure Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	And moreover, all content IS Nothing.
</p>

<p>
	There really is no difference between content and no content.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want a pure no-content experience, that's certainly possible. It's not strictly necessary, but possible. You can become pure Consciousness with no content. This is a specific type of samadhi.

<p>
	Nah.... I don't buy it.
</p>

<p>
	There is a Green awakening happening, and a huge backlash to that. But there is no Turquoise level awakening happening. Less than 0.1% of the world is at the Unitive stage of ego development and I don't see that number shifting significantly in our lifetimes.
</p>

<p>
	There will be a big Green awakening over our lifetimes though as stage Blue and Orange become increasingly morally bankrupt and outdated.
</p>

<p>
	The number of people actually grasping nonduality is pitifully low, and that will not change without better government infrastructure, massive education reform, serious redistribution of wealth, and some kind of serious checks on capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that most of the planet is stuck in stage Blue, fighting tooth and nail to get to Orange. And it will be that way for decades to come.

<p>
	I bet it will probably get a 9/10 or 10/10 rating and sell something like 30+ million copies. Unless it turns out to be turd.
</p>

<p>
	I think they've been developing it so long because they know if they can hit a 9/10 rating they will earn a billion dollars off this title. So it's really in their benefit to make it good.
</p>

<p>
	If it matches the quality of Witch 3, they will earn a billion dollars.

Their top talent will burn out and leave and CD Projekt Red will turn into EA, Blizzard, Bethesda, Bioware. That's what always happens. The more success they get, the more money they earn, the bigger their hits, the more corrupt and heartless they become.
</p>

<p>
	Once you reach that level of success and size, it all becomes a corporate machine and it will never be about the art.
</p>

<p>
	AAA game development is basically unsustainable from a creative/artistic POV. It's fucking meatgrinder.

I suppose you can argue that doing pickup is an investment into yourself, but I imagine if you are really serious about it it can get really expensive. Especially if you live in LV, go out every weekend, probably end up buying some girls drinks,Â taking someÂ girls out on dates. I mean jeez, that can add up quick.Â

<p>
	Actually, Vegas is a super affordable place to live. If you are a local here, every club has free entry for locals on Sundays-Thursdays. Parking used to be free, now it's like $10. Drinks are $18 here, but I have never bought a girl a drink in my life and have no intention of starting. Dates can be super cheap. A date for me is a $5 coffee or ice cream.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to hit up the hottest clubs in the world on Fri/Sat, that will cost you $40/night. But the clubs in Vegas are off the hook amazing. You've never seen so many hot girls in your life. $40/night is worth it if you're serious about developing your skills and you have a decent salary.
</p>

<p>
	If you are clever, you can do pickup very cheap or even free. Depends a lot on location. Drinks in Austin, TX are like $3 and none of the bars have cover. Over my entire time in pickup I spent little money. Most of my money was spent simply on traveling to the best cities. And once I paid $2000 for a bootcamp.

			I feel like if you have already achieved financial freedom and are comfortableÂ in life, then it could be worth it. I would love to spend some time trying to get better with girls but I'm so occupiedÂ trying to figure out what in hell I'mÂ going to do to avoid the dreaded 9-5 and spending lots of time reading, watching videos, and thinking. Maybe that's just an excuse. It's definitely a department I need to work on, but just not a priority at the moment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You don't need total financial freedom to do pickup. Most of the guys who I met in pickup were not financially free. They had normal 9-5 jobs and gamed at night or on the weekends.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest challenge is not money, it's time and energy. Pickup eats up a ton of time and energy. But still guys are able to do it while holding down regular jobs. I have met accountants, pilots, engineers, doctors, dentists, salesmen, etc. who did serious pickup.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I took a lot of time off work/biz to invest into pickup, and it was worth it. Of course I could only do that because I already was financially independent. But don't let this be a limiting belief. You don't have to be. But also, why not do both?!

<p>
	Well, of course Trump is an elite, but his supporters are too dumb to see that.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there is no elite conspiracy. Elites are just wealthy and powerful people acting out their self-agenda, as all people are. And they often have different agendas. Elites fight with elites all the time.

<p>
	"War criminal" is a dumb label. It is meaningless when applied to presidents and heads of state. Leaders of giant countries and militaries are forced to make combat decisions that involve the loss of thousands of lives. It is part of their job description.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is worse than Biden and Obama. Trump does more drone strikes than Obama.

<p>
	See, this is why such a label is dumb. You use it to create a gross false equivalency.
</p>

<p>
	It's like saying, "What's the difference between going bowling with my next door neighbor, Jim, who kills chickens to feed his family, and going bowling with Charles Manson? They're both killers. So I'll just go with Manson since he's already in the car and ready to drive."
</p>

<p>
	You lack imagination to see just how dangerous Trump's decisions can be if he was presented with a serious military emergency. It's very much possible that Trump's idiocy and narcissism could kill 1 million or 10 million lives.

<p>
	As the propaganda and culture war against stage Green heats up, people get polarized and are forced to take sides. Thus people like Hulse take the side of Blue/Orange vs Green in the culture wars, which can seem like regression (or it may be actual regression as their minds are slowly rotted away by right-wing propaganda).
</p>

<p>
	As the center of gravity of American culture shifts to solid Green, many people will dig in their heels and refuse to budge. Even going so far as the pull hard in the opposite direction to the "good old days" they remember.

<p>
	By definition if you are regressing down one stage, it's unconscious. Regression IS a lapse in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	People are not choosing these things. These "choices" are simply baked into their habitual low-consciousness behaviors.

			The influential historian, who specialized in American history, and social critic, the late <strong>Christopher Lasch</strong>, in his 1996. posthumously publishedÂ book ,,<strong>The Revolt of theÂ Elites and the Betrayal of Democracy</strong>'' wrote that there was a new elite emerging in American society in the 1980's and 1990's in American society, that Trump given his familialÂ background and livelihood revenues was a part of and still is,<em> that was so detached in the way's they earn their income, in which social circles they move and interact with and in where they live and how they live from ordinary Americans</em> <u>that Lasch called them the</u>Â <strong>cerebral aristocracy</strong>Â <u><em>of the contemporary globalizedÂ world</em>Â </u>and <strong>wrote</strong>Â <em>how they live lives so detached from regular people who live in the same country as them,Â that they interact and socialize only, on a deeper level, with the members of the same group as them and withÂ international elite in other countries in limited geographical pockets and exclusive social events,Â that they have become soÂ detachedÂ and wilfully oblivious to the national decay and collapse taking place in theirÂ own countries, andÂ have at this point internalizedÂ in them as part of a normal course of happenings within the country they inhabit,Â there are bad times and there are good times, while not being affected it by it all themselves</em>.
		</p>

		<p>
			Quotes from the book:
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,,Â The child of a materially wealthy civilization, like a child of any nouveau riche, is almost always spoilt, immodest and shameless.''</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, Their motto maximum pleasure, minimum responsibility, hasÂ brought about a demographic decline ofÂ the countriesÂ they live in.''</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, Patriotism, certainly does not accompany a highÂ position on the scale of their values and virtues. So theÂ following question is asked:Â Do they even consider themselves as other Americans, deep down? "</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>,, They are not on the side of their own societies, since theyÂ  fundamentally don'tÂ knowÂ it, they are on the side of global structures and cliques, in which circles they spend most of their active lives."</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			I think this aÂ good description<em> from what part American society Trump comes from</em>,Â <em>about what shaped his character </em>and <em>view of other people that are not a part of the same class in society as he is</em>.

<p>
	You have to be careful when framing global worldviews as some sort of evil.
</p>

<p>
	The above things you quoted are a basic trend of moving from stage Blue or Orange to Green. You develop a more global perspective.
</p>

<p>
	But that isn't even Trump's problem. Trump's problem is far below that of being some neoliberal elite. It's too heartless, narcissistic, and ignorant to be an effective neoliberal globalist type.

<p>
	Existence itself is formlessness. It is definitely possible to have pure empty existence minus any forms.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing (as we use it on this forum) is not a concept, it is a direct consciousness of one's true nature.

<p>
	No. All experiences are enlightenment once you simply realize there was no one ever behind them.
</p>

<p>
	Experience isn't the problem, the only problem is that self-image which keeps feeding itself, telling itself that there is someone to whom the experiences are happening to.
</p>

<p>
	Experience does not happen to anyone.

<p>
	You can become conscious of Absolute Truth. This is quite an achievement. But Absolute Truth is not anywhere elsewhere but here and now. Just remove the ego sense and all will be revealed as Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not merely another experience, it's a meta thing in which you realize the true nature of all experiences.

	It would be cool if they set up this nothing conference, sold all these tickets, and then on the day of, there was just nothing. No speakers, no videos, no news updates. Just a total blank. <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<title>Why canâ€™t rape be objectively wrong?</title>

<p>
	You can talk to them and get a feel for their worldviews.
</p>

<p>
	I've hung out with and listened to a lot of guys in the pickup community. They tend to treat rape as a joke. Some of them are actual rapists. When speaking with such guys, they clearly don't think of rape as anything wrong or harmful.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of immature guys tend to think of rape like this:
</p>

<p>
	"Well, if I got raped by a hot girl, that would be cool and I would be happy, therefore, rape isn't a big deal. Those feminist/SJW types are just making a big deal out of nothing. Besides, girls are sluts and whores anyway, so what difference does it make?"
</p>

<p>
	It's a very self-centered view of sex. Women are simply seen as convenient objects to satisfy one's own sexual needs, and then discarded. The belief is, they are all sluts anyway, so they lose nothing and they aren't really hurt.
</p>

	Why would they be? The purpose of most AAA game companies is maximizing profits, not creating art.

There are hundreds of possible different better states which may or may not be related to enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to actually have a meaningful discussion, you should explain what it is you exactly became conscious of.

<p>
	Perhaps a common mark of toxic masculinity ideology is that it interprets the term "toxic masculinity" as meaning: all masculinity is toxic. But to say that some forms of masculinity are toxic does not mean there isn't healthy masculinity.

	Describe what you became conscious of and what "enlightenment" means to you.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of people here claim many things, but often they are fooling themselves.

	If you ever awaken deep enough, you will realize that the opposite pole of your own is just something you imagined in order to identify as your pole.
</p>

<p>
	If you identify as masculine, you will realize feminine is something you imagined as "not you".
</p>

<p>
	If you identify as feminine, you will realize that masculine is something you imagined as "not you".
</p>

<p>
	The Ultimate Truth is you are both, and beyond.
</p>

<p>
	Masculine and feminine identification is like a schizoid rift in the Mind of God. God is suffering from multiple personality disorder.

<p>
	Not it isn't.
</p>

<p>
	If you take a moment to contemplate this, you'll realize that "harm" is a purely relative notion. "Harm" is always defined relative to some ego's needs and desires, which are themselves relative and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	Harm is a relative, subjective, biased, egoic notion.
</p>

<p>
	YOU think rape is harmful. A rapist certainly doesn't think that. And your view has no higher epistemic position than that of a rapist in the absolute sense.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of men genuinely believe that rape is not harmful. And that is true from the POV.
</p>
