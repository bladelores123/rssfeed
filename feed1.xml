Of course this is deeply intertwined with your whole emotional system and even what you think of as your body.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, karma is what stymies Self-Love. Karma is like the clouds that obscure the sun which always shines.

<title>Have you ever been in a relationship with a Colombian girl.?</title>

<p>
	Be careful. She might be scamming you.
</p>

<p>
	Probably lots of desperate girls in Colombia looking for an American sugar daddy. Don't be a sucker.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "Colombian girls". There are millions of girls in Colombia, some decent, some evil. Just like anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
	Don't buy her anything. See if she still loves you. That's how you screen out the evil ones.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of rap is also stage Orange, so it's not quite as bad as you think.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, rap originates out of black hoods, which tend to have a lot of Red going on. Rap is a coping mechanism for dealing with the toxicity of¬†Red. Would you rather have teens listening to rap or robbing 7-Elevens?

	Omniscience is not what you think it is. It is not knowledge of all relative human things.
</p>

<p>
	It certainly is not anything your logical mind can understand or explain.
</p>

<p>
	It is way beyond knowledge.

	There is no such thing as non-being or falsehood.

	Masculine is more active, seeking to enforce itself on the world.
</p>

<p>
	Feminine is more passive, seeking to soak in the world.

<p>
	Is this really so hard to understand?

<p>
	You are not going to wrap your mind around this, ever.
</p>

<p>
	You want an explanation for reality, and it will not come. What must happen is that your mind must die. Then Truth is revealed.
</p>

<p>
	Once you fully see Truth/God, you will not be able to speak it or even think about it. It's that radical. You will not be able to say, "Ah, now I understand, God does A, B, C because X, Y, Z." No! Instead you'll die of awe and shock. And that death will be the answer.

<p>
	I would advise you guys to stay away from chronic weed smoking.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to use weed to trip for spiritual purposes, that's a very different thing than vaping weed every night to chill out.
</p>

<p>
	The way you know you're doing serious spiritual work with your substance is that it's exhausting, you need time off to integrate it, and you're even scared to do it again right away.
</p>

<p>
	If you are tripping properly you shouldn't be eager to trip the next day. There should a somber tone when you even thinking about tripping. It should be something you do with mild hesitation.
</p>

<p>
	That is precisely why Bernie denouncers¬†don't like that man.
</p>

<p>
	Selfish people do not like being reminded of selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of development to reach a point where what Bernie says can be appreciated.

	Such experiences also¬†teach empathy and humility. Consciousness is a very powerful thing. It can be as serious as a concentration camp. It's not all New Age crystals and unicorns.

<p>
	Look, triggering attraction in women is a very specific and highly counter-intuitive skill. It has also been well documented and validating in-field.
</p>

<p>
	I have not interest in arguing over what works. I've approached 1000s of women and I've seen what works and what does not. You can do the same and find out. Otherwise speculating about it is a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
	Women are not attracted to what they logically tell themselves they are attracted to. And it's pointless trying to convince women logically about how attraction works. Attraction works exactly how it works and no amount of talk will change that.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well try to convince all men that they shouldn't like boobs. Good luck.
</p>

Most mangos sold are too green and too hard.
</p>

<p>
	And peeling those suckers takes work without much flesh to show for it. At least a pineapple will yield a sizable meal.

<p>
	How about you actually contemplate why pain exists rather than complaining about how you know better?
</p>

<p>
	Imagine the following scenario: you have God's powers to create baby from scratch. You've¬†designed the whole baby and now you have one final design decision to make before it is born: Should it be able to feel pain? Yes or No?
</p>

<p>
	If you select No, your baby will die within a few weeks.
</p>

<p>
	If you select Yes, your baby will live to be 80 years old.
</p>

<p>
	That is reality.
</p>

<p>
	If you didn't feel pain there would literally be nothing stopping you from grilling your own arm for dinner. There would also be nothing stopping you from raping your own mother.

It's basically your entire way of holding reality.
</p>

<p>
	The way you hold reality becomes the obstacle to seeing reality in a totally unbiased way (Truth). How you hold reality IS your bias. To see how reality looks to the unbiased mind you must stop holding it any particular way, which is very difficult to do because that requires letting go of everything you consider to be real and important.
</p>

<p>
	For example, are you willing to let go of your family? Your religion? Your science? Your personal life story? Your goals? Your beliefs about enlightenment? Your gender? The Earth? etc. It's hard for the mind to unsee those things.
</p>

<p>
	You can think of karma as all the mental attachments of the mind which keep it constrained in its finite shape. By cutting each attachment the entire field of consciousness gets free and goes infinite and unbiased.
</p>

<p>
	So, for example, if you believe that science is true, that's a big mental attachment which prevents your consciousness from realizing God. And you have 100s of such attachments. The most important attachments are not material objects, they are intellectual beliefs and stories. For example, the belief that you were born in a certain year at a certain place, that's another big chunk of your mental karma which makes it very difficult to realize God.
</p>

<p>
	To full enter¬†God-mode all that mental karma must be overcome in one way or another. Could be via a psychedelic or yoga or self-inquiry or whatever.
</p>

	Give it a week¬†or even a month. It will clear out of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The lesson here for you is¬†not to fuck around with psychedelics but to treat them with respect. You don't just triple your¬†dose on a whim. If you are gonna have that kind of attitude, expect to be bitchslapped by God.

</p>

<p>
	(BTW, my sympathies for you being held at knife point. I'm not laughing at that part.)
</p>

<p>
	Anyways, you have a fundamental lack of understanding of survival and God.
</p>

<p>
	God is ALL THINGS! Including fear. Being God doesn't mean you never fear again. It means you realize that whatever is happening is Absolute Truth and you accept it for what it is. Your mistake here is thinking, "Once I'm enlightened I will always feel happy, calm, nice, peaceful." Fuck no! If a lion¬†walks into the room your body will feel terror and you will run. This does not invalidate enlightenment. This is just common sense. God is protecting its avatar.
</p>

<p>
	People have so many silly ideas about enlightenment. So many myths and stories by the superego of moral and proper behavior. All of that is crap. Enlightenment has zero restrictions. You are allowed to feel fear, anger, sadness, craving, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Of course God created fear for a reason, it is absolutely crucial for survival. And survival is not a bad thing. Without survival you can't experience life at all. Nor can you help awaken others.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind, there are many degrees of awakening, and whatever little bit of it you¬†had¬†was tiny. Also don't confuse a few awakenings with mastery. Mastery requires decades of training. You could train yourself not to fear lions or knives, but you haven't even begun that work in earnest.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: why do you judge and demonize fear and anger?
</p>

<p>
	That's your problem right there. You are not practicing Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	STOP JUDGING EVERYTHING!
</p>

<p>
	STOP JUDGING EVERYTHING!
</p>

<p>
	STOP JUDGING EVERYTHING!
</p>

<p>
	Get it?
</p>

	I am merely communicating to you guys that you are lazy. You do not really care about truth. You are here dicking around.

<p>
	Truth is a serious pursuit and it's clear simply by one's attitude who is serious about it and who is not.
</p>

<p>
	This is extremely advanced work we are doing, yet many of you treat it so sloppily. As if this is some CNN debate panel where one¬†can just spew bullshit and opinions¬†with impungity.

			It's funny how each time someone says that science has often tested these so called paranormal phenomena and always found a rational explanation, defenders of the paranormal start to attack science as a whole, saying how the experiment was biased and flawed.¬†

<p>
	No, you have it precisely backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Serious statistical studies have been conducted many times on paranormal phenomena by serious researchers, and the result is always the same: paranormal phenomena is proven beyond any reasonable doubt.
</p>

<p>
	But you have not read these studies because they are rejected by gatekeepers of academia because in their paradigm the paranormal is impossible so all research which proves it must be false.
</p>

<p>
	Science itself has proven the paranormal. This fact is simply denied and not advertized to you, so you don't know about it.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is that you speak surely of things you have not actually researched nor contemplated nor experienced. You are just spreading dogma without knowing what you are doing. You feel so certain, but you are actually wrong and you¬†are too lazy and incurious to check that you are wrong.
</p>

<p>
	So here we are.

<p>
	That's difficult.
</p>

<p>
	Although we have an inside joke about Christian girls in the pick up community. The more she professes to be a devout Christian the more of a slut she is <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Do not believe for a second that religious girls won't fuck on a dime. But of course overcoming some of that cultural programming can be a pain sometimes and may not be worth it. Do you really want to sleep with a stage Blue girl? Careful what you wish for.
</p>

<p>
	Make your life easy and look for girls who are comfortable with their sexuality.
</p>

<p>
	When you go to a bar/club the whole point is that the girls there are DTF. Anyone in a bar/club is fair game. They aren't there for intellectual stimulation.
</p>

<p>
	The best thing you can do for your game is move to a large city with lots of girls and good nightlife. You're not gonna get good with girls living in the countryside.

<title>No Mind and I Am Not My Body Experiences at Meditation Course</title>

<p>
	Sweet.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, the ego-mind will recoil in horror upon realization of the Void. It comes as a jolt of terror down to your bones. Existential horror.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is the biggest thing holding you back from God.
</p>

<p>
	If you're not doing psychedelics, retreats are crucial for awakening because the only way to match the power of a psychedelic is with days upon days of uninterrupted concentration/meditation. That's why you had your Void encounter on retreat. It's hard to get that kind of uninterrupted concentration at home.
</p>

<p>
	There will be no awakening without laser focused concentration for hours on end.
</p>

<p>
	Good work.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, it's best not to take your partners or friends with you because it creates a distraction. You don't want to be worrying about what he is thinking or feeling or what he's doing. That breaks your concentration.
</p>

<p>
	Next time, go solo. If he wants to do retreats, have him take a different one. Awakening is not a team sport.

<p>
	Simple. The people in academia are self-biased fools. Richard Dawkins style.
</p>

<p>
	Science has validated paranormal phenomena long ago beyond reasonable doubt. The studies and data are simply denied. They have to be, or else the entire credibility of materialist science crumbles.

<p>
	It was my debates with him about evolution and God which got me to start contemplating epistemology from which all of Actualized.org was spawned. By contemplating epistemology I got my philosophy degree in university.
</p>

<p>
	After a debate with Tiago and his dumb Christian friends, I would come home and contemplate the nature of human knowledge. I was baffled how such people could be Christians and believe the Earth was 5000 years old. It made no sense to me back then.
</p>

<p>
	I allude to this in one of my older videos on epistemology.
</p>

<p>
	The Mechanics of Belief, or was it The Ultimate Model of Human Knowledge?
</p>

<p>
	Can't recall.
</p>

<p>
	I wonder if he's still a Christian?

<p>
	No, I never said it was all suffering and pain. I said SOME nights. Other times it can fun, exciting, positive, etc. Overall it's an adventure. Don't think of it as some negative chore you must do.
</p>

<p>
	I don't understand why you need to feel suicidal about it. If you're doing the work, there's plenty of hope and no need for suicide. You will get laid if you go out enough. I guarantee it.

<p>
	I'm kidding (sorta). I know what you mean.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, of course it's possible to build loving relationships. But in order to do that you must first fully understand how deep survival goes. People often jump into things calling it "love" when really it's survival masquerading as love. Of course survival too is love. But that's not what you want. You want something higher. We can get to something higher, but we need to start with a solid foundation first.

<p>
	Those are technical words.
</p>

<p>
	All words are relative. You gotta learn how they are used within a certain paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Of course things are confusing to the ego-mind. That's the whole challenge of this work. It takes years to un-con-fuse things.

<p>
	Is it really so hard to understand what a devil is? Or what love is? Or what God is? These things can be explained to a child.

<p>
	If it is ever complete, yes, it will be a massive tome over 1000 pages.
</p>

<p>
	But it will also contain many colorful illustrations and diagrams.
</p>

<p>
	I have a few parts written and probably 1000 pages of outlines and notes.

<p>
	Figuring out how to organize it all into a linear sequence is the biggest challenge.

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	Both genders are looking to maximize survival of the ego-mind. Whatever that entails. Each ego-mind has it's own priorities and needs which it self-biasedly justifies as "authentic", "true", and "good". It's all illusions and devilry within devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is not about truth.
</p>

<p>
	A truthful relationship is a virtually non-existent thing. They are rarer than hen's teeth. You can create one, but it's nothing that happens automatically.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's important to distinguish attraction vs dating vs relationship.
</p>

<p>
	These are distinct phases. What I'm talking about here is mostly the first phase: attraction, without which nothing else is possible.
</p>

<p>
	Once the relationship begins for real (after a few times of sex), then things change.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend all guys practice what I call Conscious Relationship. Which is a huge topic which I won't explain here. Suffice it to say, you ladies would love it. It's everything you want out of a relationship and much more. It's the thing you wish pickup was because you're not concerned about the attraction phase much.
</p>

<p>
	I am by no means only about attraction and anti-relationship. I think there's lots of value in intimate relationship. But before we get there, we gotta bang <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> There's a certain order of operations to the mating game.

<p>
	Women are attracted to cocky guys. Stop listening to what women logically tell you they want.
</p>

<p>
	The ability to talk endlessly about yourself is crucial. That's what all extroverts know how to do to initiate and sustain conversation.
</p>

<p>
	It's not egotistical.

<p>
	"Today I blew out my tire. Then this happened. Then that happened." etc. That's how conversation is made.

<p>
	Yes, that's the catch-22 of it.
</p>

<p>
	How do you handle it? Same way you handle getting a job. You slowly build up experience through practice. Even if you are needy, it's not like 0% of women will sleep with you. There will still be 1 in 100 who will. You can also, like, keep your neediness suppressed for a while while you're with a girl. It's not like all of your inner demons need to be worn on your sleeve. She can't know you're needy unless you act needy in front of her.
</p>

<p>
	There is an element of fake it till you make it in this process. Same as with getting a job.

	Truth is NOT a model or a description of any kind.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot have alternative versions of Truth. Truth is singular and absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is not a state either.

<p>
	You are not appreciating how radical this thing called "Truth" is. Your mind cannot hold it, it holds your mind.

<p>
	That's precisely the case.
</p>

<p>
	There is perfect balance between freedom and limitation.
</p>

<p>
	Maximization of Love is a meta thing. It's not just love, it's meta-Love. Meta-Love means that God doesn't force things to be loving, God's Love is too advanced for such brute force methods. God let's Love breathe. God creates space for all beings to co-create Love. That is True Love. That is Meta-Love. It's a Love that allows all beings to love according to their capacity.
</p>

<p>
	God's Love for Hitler allows Hitler the ability to express his love by killing 10 million people. If God forced Hitler to be a nice man that wouldn't be maximum Love. That would be selfishness.

	Complete 10 trips at 2 grams first.

<p>
	Doubling from 2g to 4g will quadruple the power. At 4g, mushrooms can seriously mindfuck you. So be cautious.

<p>
	Match is part of the process.
</p>

<p>
	Of course not every woman will be a match with every man. That's all sorted out in the field.
</p>

<p>
	It's not like if a guy has game he can attract/sleep with 100% of women. About 33% of women will love him, 33% of women will hate him, and 33% of women will be indifferent.
</p>

<p>
	There's always an element of luck and personalities need to match up. That's why he chats with 10 women, 3 get attracted, 1 comes home.
</p>

<p>
	A highly attractive man is actually more polarizing. Some women will absolutely hate him. But those who like him will LOVE him.
</p>

<p>
	You also have to keep in mind that not all guys with game are the same. Each guys attracts a specific subset of female personality types. Because game is expressed differently through different personality types. Game is not a specific type of guy, it's general principles of attractiveness which are incarnated uniquely by each guy, attracting different kinds of women. For example, humor is going to vary from guy to guy. Guys can have very different senses and styles of humor. But learning the general principles of humor will help every guy, no matter what his style of humor is. And all girls love some style of humor. Humor can be dry, witty, intellectual, sexual, subdued, bold, sarcastic, self-deprecating, dark, physical, nerdy, etc.

<p>
	That's such a huge topic.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a few things quickly off the top of my head:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Laser eye contact
	</li>
	<li>
		Learning to create a genuine smile on a dime
	</li>
	<li>
		Firm, commanding tone of voice. Slowing down your rate of speech.
	</li>
	<li>
		Being relaxed and at ease in your body when talking
	</li>
	<li>
		Simply lots of socialization and conversation experience (doesn't even have to be with women).
	</li>
	<li>
		The stuff I talk about in my video: How To Be Funny
	</li>
	<li>
		The ability to talk about yourself endlessly.
	</li>
	<li>
		Dressing sharp. Get all of your clothing tailored for slim fit. Groom yourself well. Upgrade your whole wardrobe to be stylish. Develop a sense of style that suits you.
	</li>
	<li>
		The ability to be playful and laugh at yourself and life
	</li>
	<li>
		Handle your sexual neediness so that you aren't sexually needy
	</li>
	<li>
		Develop charisma -- I have a good book about charisma on my book list.
	</li>
	<li>
		Passion for life. You must be building an awesome life for yourself aside from girls/sex/relationship. The girl should be the least important part of your life. Your life should be so awesome that anyone who comes into contact with you would feel lucky. You must be in love with yourself and your life.
	</li>
	<li>
		Self-Love. Accept yourself as you are, completely. Be thrilled to be you. Treat yourself as God's gift to the world and to women.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	¬†

<p>
	Of course most guys doing game are Orange, and some even Red. I've known guys who do game who are flat out rapists with pending legal cases against them. But this is rare. Most guys are Orange. Yes, many guys objectify women and sex. But you also have to understand, this is not a function of game itself, this is simply how most guys today think about sex. A stage Orange man will objectify women whether he learns game or not.
</p>

<p>
	Russell Brand used to be heroin addict. So, yeah, people grow.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's "locker room talk"? Honestly, lots of guys talk that way behind closed doors. That's excessive Orange mentality. It's just hidden.
</p>

<p>
	You have too appreciate that pickup brings up into the open what has been repressed and hidden for centuries. Stage Blue repressed sex so much for so long that stage Orange swings in the opposite direction. There is still a social stigma about being open about the reality of dating and sex. Dating can be ruthless. Not just from the man's side from the woman's side too. Women are not angels in all this. They too are constantly manipulating to meet their survival needs.

<p>
	You are unwittingly condemning men to stay losers.
</p>

<p>
	Become a charming man is not something that happens naturally for most guys due to poor social conditioning. Becoming a man takes work! Being shy, unsociable, self-conscious, meek, fearful, angry, bitter, lonely, needy, inarticulate, poor at physical touch, bad sense of humor, etc -- these are not natural. This is the result of bad upbringing and lack of training.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what source the man got his charm from. If he's charming, he's charming. That's real and girls respond accordingly because they don't care about the backstory of how he became charming.

				<p>
					You have to understand that attraction and sex are not a logical thing. All your logic and excuses will fly out the window as soon as the right guy shows up who knows how to push your buttons.
				</p>

				<p>
					The whole magic of game is that cuts through the logic that women use to stop themselves from having sex.
				</p>

				<p>
					It's possible to narrate to a woman every step of the game you're run on her, and she will still fall under its spell. Because its not logical. In fact, I've done just that as a technique. It still works. Attraction happens on a subconscious level. A guy charms his way into your pants. It's spooky.
				</p>
			</div>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			My experience of my sexuality differs from this. Though I could see how it would work on women who don't have a very strong intuition or boundaries or who are just lonely... which probably describes like 25% of women. So, it's a sizable enough minority to find a sexual partner as a man. But I don't think this is typical.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's certainly not logical. But usually the guy is someone I have either a platonic friendship with or an acquaintance¬†relationship to. And it isn't based on looks or any other specific trait. But the draw is curiosity about his energy at a distance. It's always the question of whether or not the guy is interested and the wondering of what's happening in his mind. So, it is introversion and nonchalance and lack of clear interest that attracts me along with his general energy.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not 25% of women. 100% of heterosexual women.
</p>

<p>
	What you describe in your 2nd paragraph: the vibe, the energy, the nonchalance... that's exactly what game is.
</p>

<p>
	You are thinking of game as a set of tricks men use to maniuplate women to sleep with them. But that's not real game, that's crap game. Real game is a man simply behaving in a strong, authentic, masculine way which generates a really charming vibe that girls cannot resist.
</p>

<p>
	The charm isn't fake, it's real! The woman gets attracted not because she is verbally tricked, but because the guy is actually being an awesome guy to his bones.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine your dream guy: strong, bold, charming, smooth, natural, funny, cool, exuding masculine vibe. That's what pickup trains a guy how to be. And once a guy becomes that way, every girl wants to marry him. The trick is, once a guy becomes that way he has so many options that he may not want to get married to any one girl. And thus a player is born.
</p>

<p>
	Despite what they say, girls love players. She¬†simply wants to lock him down for herself. That is the real issue. Girls struggle with players because they are hard to lock down.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, sex is a marketplace and girls do not want to admit that.
</p>

<title>Psychics: real vs. fake</title>

<p>
	Of course psychics are real.
</p>

<p>
	The doubt itself is silly if you have sufficient experience working with them.
</p>

<p>
	What's fake is the materialist denial of psychics. Materialism is a joke.

<p>
	It is far more radical than that.
</p>

<p>
	Truth includes static and dynamic, and an infinite number of other possibilities.
</p>

<p>
	It is Infinity.

<p>
	Infinity cannot be explained. Period.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is trying to explain it. All explanations are finite, relative, and incomplete.
</p>

<p>
	It's all pure imagination.

<p>
	They were definitely not memories but entirely unique mystical and nondual experiences with new genuine insights.

<p>
	Of course a prior history of psychedelics and so forth helped expand my mind and therefore made such experiences more possible.

	Many years ago, before I started Actualized or knew about awakening, once in a dream I accidentally became conscious of the infinity of consciousness. But I lacked the theoretical framework to understand the significance of that experience, so I sort of forgot about it.

	Yes, I know your pain very well. I have lost 100s of such girls out of sheer incompetence and weakness.

<p>
	How badly do you want to get good? That's the key question. As Zizek would say, are you willing to sell your mother into slavery to get good with girls? If not, your results will be mediocre. You need serious vision and drive here. You will have to work your ass off for it. Having sex with lots of hot women is not something that life just hands you on a silver platter. Becoming a highly attractive man is a huge makeover project. It involves making deep structural changes to your entire lifestyle and way of thinking.

<p>
	You have to understand that attraction and sex are not a logical thing. All your logic and excuses will fly out the window as soon as the right guy shows up who knows how to push your buttons.
</p>

<p>
	The whole magic of game is that cuts through the logic that women use to stop themselves from having sex.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible to narrate to a woman every step of the game you're run on her, and she will still fall under its spell. Because its not logical. In fact, I've done just that as a technique. It still works. Attraction happens on a subconscious level. A guy charms his way into your pants. It's spooky.

<p>
	There are pros and cons to both.

<p>
	I wasn't speaking to their safety. I was speaking to their efficacy. Although I have not really encountered any serious safety issues as long as you're not doing something stupid. And I should here note, lots of people do stupid things. So I can't speak to that. My personal standard is always extreme carefulness with any psychedelic substance.

<p>
	Eating raw foods definitely improves clarity of mind. The challenge is getting enough calories and doing all the prep work since you gotta make it all yourself. It's a huge volume of matter just to chew through. It's also very expensive.

<p>
	Yes, I've had extremely deep and powerful awakenings inside of dreams. They are as legit as any other. The problem is they fade pretty fast and it's harder to build a bridge between them and "real life".
</p>

<p>
	Still, a dream awakening is better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Try to translate it to real life.

<p>
	It takes a lot of study and practice and inner work to reach a point where you can apply Spiral Dynamics accurately.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a simple model, which is why it's so good.
</p>

<p>
	And it takes an even deeper understanding of epistemology and consciousness work to realize when to let go of Spiral Dynamics, or as I like to say, how to "hold a model loosely".
</p>

<p>
	You have to be able to use a model and be able to let it go on a dime. This is part of the epistemological work. All models are limited by definition and you have to develop such flexibility of mind that you can jump from one model to another the way a professional photographer switches lenses. And then you have to be able to "shoot raw", without any lenses at all.

			I've always had this little fantasy where I meet someone in a position like that, where they actually <em>are</em> the right person for me - and they <em>do</em> have integrity - it's something that they would <em>never</em> do or <em>ever</em> have done, and it somehow ends up working out.

	You need a lot of practice physically escalating on a girl in a noncreepy way. Learning how to touch her is crucial for success. Touching is so important. Start touching her with 3 seconds of meeting her and don't let up. Escalate your touching all throughout¬†the date.
</p>

<p>
	Google: "kino escalation ladder"
</p>

<p>
	You need¬†to learn kino
</p>

<p>
	You need to take every chance you can to touch her to make her comfortable with your touch. Start with playful, non-erotic touching, then ramp it up to the heavy stuff.
