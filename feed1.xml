It is not binary. I do not like it when people try to make it binary. To me it always comes in degrees and also with facets.
</p>

<p>
	What I have become conscious of goes beyond anything that I have ever heard any teacher teach. I don't care how masterful they claim to be. So I cannot listen to any teachers any more. Because there are levels of consciousness beyond all teachers and teachings. There are levels which cannot be spoken or taught in any way. And there is no method for reaching them.
</p>

<p>
	There is no higher authority than God. And you are it. So any authority figure you turn to is actually delusion. All gurus and masters are a thing you are hallucinating. You are truly the only guru in existence! So watch out who you give your power to.
</p>

<p>
	YOU ARE GOD! Whatever you imagine becomes true for you.

	That's not a fear. That's what I want! But you always come down.

<p>
	That used to be fear long time ago, when I first started tripping. But not any more because I always come back. And if I didn't, that would be fine too. There is no death.

			Fair enough. I personally have been vaping it and I found that it works very well for me. For vaping, it helps if you have done it once with a sitter or if you first start with lower doses. I have a sense that vaping would be even more powerful for you, so looking forward to your report.

<p>
	If I wanted more powerful I could just double my plugged dose.
</p>

<p>
	One of the beauties of plugging is that it gives you perfect dose control. There is no guesswork. The full dose gets delivered every time.

<p>
	I have died so many times by now that there is no fear or pain at all. It is a pure joy. I just relax and look forward to it. It's really the easiest thing in the world. But not if your ego isn't purified. Each trip purifies you more and more and more until very little resistance remains.

<p>
	He hasn't tried plugging though.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I will vape at some point. It's just unnecessary once you got plugging down. Which is why I haven't done it.
</p>

<p>
	Especially for ordinary people, plugging is ideal because it is so smooth and gentle. Vaping will traumatize many of you because you will end up accidentally vaping too much. Plugging is the more responsible method.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, you can plug as large a dose as you want. So lack of potency is not an issue. Plugging can also traumatize many of you if you're not careful. Just because it's smooth does not mean it isn't powerful as hell.

<p>
	So here are my results from testing & comparing 5-MeO-DMT HCl vs Oxalate vs freebase:
</p>

<p>
	I have tested them all using the plugging method.
</p>

<p>
	All 3 plug equally well and produce exactly the same quality of trip. The potency per scoop is roughly the same. Of course each substance has slightly different density, so the potency per scoop will vary between them. You can discover your perfect dose through some simple experimentation. Start with 1 microscoop, then dose 1.5 microscoops, then 2 microscoops, and so on until you find what suits you. For me the ideal dose is 1 to 2 microscoops. But that is just me.
</p>

<p>
	As far as dissolving, it works like this:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		HCl: easiest to dissolve. Dissolves in water within seconds. The substance will become perfectly dissolved.
	</li>
	<li>
		Freebase: pretty easy to dissolve by first adding 2 drops of ordinary cooking vinegar, stirring until fully dissolved, and only then adding your water. The substance will become perfectly dissolved.
	</li>
	<li>
		Oxalate: hardest to dissolve. Use hot water and stir it for several minutes. Eventually it will dissolve almost completely.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	So the bottom line is, no matter what form of 5-MeO-DMT you have, it will dissolve in water and work perfectly well for plugging. All of this has been tested and proven. If plugging isn't working for you, make sure you are plugging it properly. It's very important to only plug after emptying your bowels otherwise it may not work at all. If it still isn't working, then you have an immunity to this method/substance, the cause of which I do not know.
</p>

<p>
	My deepest trip ever actually came from plugging 1 microscope of freebase. It was unbelievably potent. I'm not sure if that was due to it being freebase or simply because I've already done so much 5-MeO-DMT in my life and other kinds of work. Each trip tends to build on the previous ones, taking it to the next level. There are at least dozens of levels, with each level being an order of magnitude above the previous one.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is not a substance you do once or twice. This is a substance you need to work 50+ times to get the full scope of it. Your first 10-20 trips are only the prequel to the main story.
</p>

<p>
	At least that's how it works for me. Your results may vary. Keep in mind that individual differences are real and can be significant. This work requires a lot of experimentation and exploration.
</p>

<p>
	Only take 5-MeO-DMT on a totally empty stomach. At least 3 hours of no food. Otherwise you will REALLY regret it.
</p>

You are making them up. I make no distinction between a psychedelic trip and "real life".
</p>

<p>
	What matters to me is realization of Truth. This realization is not a function of time.

<p>
	Realization is realization. It happens at the moment it happens. What happens afterward is another matter. In that moment there actually is no afterward because there is only the eternal NOW. Future is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	You can realize that 2 x 2 = 4. You can also forget that realization. Then you can re-realize. And so on.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to experience what the Buddha (probably) experienced and then know it.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in the end we cannot know with 100% certainty what the Buddha experienced or realized. It was not necessarily the highest level. But if we give him the benefit of the doubt, let's assume it was the highest level. You can experience it too.
</p>

<p>
	You actually ARE the Buddha.

<p>
	All this talk of brains is ultimately wrong. The brain is literally a hallucination and you cannot explain the causes because reality is uncaused, amechanical, and totally direct.
</p>

<p>
	The cause of everything is YOU! You imagine everything into being. Including your brain, 5-MeO-DMT, lobsters, and Leo.
</p>

<p>
	At the highest levels of consciousness there is just you imagining the whole world into being. The end.
</p>

<p>
	Do not try to shoehorn enlightenment into a scientific scheme. Science is a hallucination too.

<p>
	Yes.
</p>

<p>
	It's too radical to explain.
</p>

<p>
	There is no person. It is locked onto the one and only God. The problem is that you think you're a person with other people around you. All of that is imagination. You are imagining your own birth, personhood, and universe.

That is irrelevant at the moment of realization.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something isn't permanent does not make it any less important to one's growth.
</p>

<p>
	And you never come back quite the same. It changes you. Just like a meditation retreat. It does not solve all problems at once. Nor is anyone claiming that.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful with how you set your expectations. The psychedelic path is a unique path. It does not have to align with any other path, nor meet the milestones of any other path. It does not have to fit the 10 Ox Herding pics or anything else. You can leap straight to total enlightenment in 5 minutes. And then jump back down. And that's okay. It is what it is.

</blockquote>

<p>
	There is much more to this work than simply realizing Absolute Truth. That is important but you need many other minor teachings as well, which I offer. Not everything is about enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Not just 5-MeO. Other psychedelics and also meditation, self-inquiry, contemplation, and study. All that adds up to be larger tham the sum of its parts.
</p>

<p>
	But of course 5-MeO is the ultimate, if you can handle it. It is not for newbies. It requires a significant foundation to appreciate. Other psychedelics are better for newbies, yet still very powerful and truth-revealing.

<p>
	This is not a free for all. This is a spiritual classroom. I am the teacher here. This is my teaching platform. If you don't like it, you can go follow some other teacher or start your own platform.
</p>

<p>
	I learn a lot from my students, but I am not in a student position within my own school in the way that you are. Our relationship is not symmetrical here. You are being led and I am in the leadership position. If you disagree with my leadership then don't follow me. As the leader I am not infallible. But I must still make the final call. That's how leadership works.
</p>

<p>
	It becomes problematic and pathological when you try to have it both ways: on the one hand you want to be led, on the other hand you want to lead the leader. It is a mistake to go into a spiritual school and try to lead the leader as a student.  You can give feedback, but only up to a certain point. If you reach a point where your feedback becomes constant disagreement with the leader, then it is your duty to leave and go off on your own or find a new person to follow.
</p>

<p>
	All of this should be common sense and go without saying. But apparently some folks here need it said.
</p>

<p>
	Consider this: If Christ himself descended from Heaven and started to teach you, you would find a 1001 ways to disagree with him and challenge his leadership. Because that's what the ego-mind does. Either that, or it worships. Both are problematic.

A symbol is, by definition, a thing which tries to not be itself. So every symbol is a lie. That's the whole utility of symbols.
</p>

<p>
	The map is not the territory.
</p>

<p>
	Because the map is part of the territory.
</p>

<p>
	Truth must be totally direct. There cannot be any intermediate process to it. No thought, no brain, no perception, no reason, no symbol. Because all of that is itself part of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is the Absolute Infinite set. The super-set of all sub-sets. Truth is simply Being. Whatever is, is the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth cannot be spoken or pointed to. Because even the pointer is itself part of the Truth which you are trying to grasp. In fact, YOU are Truth you're trying to grasp. Truth cannot be grasped because whatever you try to grasp it with, it itself. So the only way to "grasp" the Truth is to BE it.
</p>

<p>
	A knife blade cannot cut itself, the eye cannot see itself, a finger cannot point to itself. Because they just ARE!
</p>

<p>
	This is the self-reference problem. See my video on: The Metaphysical Implications Of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Grasping The Illusory Nature Of Thought

	Saying you are too busy to take 5-MeO-DMT is what's silly. You got nothing better to do.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just about getting home. It's about exploring your home deeper. There are rooms in your home you never knew existed.
</p>

<p>
	Well, the impossible is possible. Discover for yourselves. I am just a messenger.

<p>
	Sure. It is impossible to take every thing someone suggests to you without discrimination. There are literally 1000s of research chemicals which almost no human being has ever taken. And some of them can be very nasty. I am not gonna ever try them all.
</p>

<p>
	But to refuse to try 5-MeO-DMT given its well-documented track record is quite foolish. I don't care how enlightened you are. This substance is pure magic. This is the actual Holy Grail in powdered form. And yet most people criticize and ridicule it. It's quite sad really. God presents itself to you in powdered form and you reject him. Why? For some silly reason?

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, that is not what QM says. What it says is: it does not have a position or velocity. It's not merely that our equipment is not good enough to measure it. It's that all measurement itself is relative and constructive. Positions, velocities, and even individual particles do not have an individual distinct objective reality. They are artifacts of the kinds of questions you pose to the world. If you change your questions you will get different answers.
</p>

<p>
	The world is not made out of individual particles as though a castle built of Lego bricks. This is a silly, childish idea which has been long disproven by mainstream science.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot ground reality whatsoever. Not in particles, not in strings, not in mathematics, not in positions, not in 3D space, not in time, not in velocities, not in objects, not in the brain, not in the Big Bang, not in evolution, not in science, not in logic, not in anything.
</p>

<p>
	It is groundless and absolutely infinite.

<p>
	Any form you say is fundamental, isn't.

	QM hit its face against this brick wall.

<p>
	Total omniscience simply cannot be explained in any way. In that moement you are conscious of how you designed the entire universe.

<p>
	It is God's total omniscience. It goes way beyond knowledge. It is the whole universe.

<p>
	Even if you meet a person you will still not know their degree of enlightenment.

<p>
	I have always said that talking about other people's enlightenment is speculative.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless, speculate you will. Some of you here speculate poorly.

They are not. Since there is no one to say what is nothing and what is something, they become identical.
</p>

<p>
	Reality cannot know whether it is something or nothing. So it is both at once.

<p>
	Some degree of realization of no-self.
</p>

<p>
	The attachment with being exclusively identified with the body must be broken.
</p>

<p>
	This is usually called stream-entry in Buddhism or kensho in Zen.
</p>

<p>
	There are much much deeper levels.
</p>

<p>
	Total omniscience is possible. I recently peaked into total omnisicence. It's so fucking radical.

<p>
	Full bliss? Lol
</p>

<p>
	You expect an enlightened master to always be bubbly for you? You will be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not limited to any one emotional state. Most enlightened masters look so ordinary and normal that you would never know they were enlightened, like a cat sitting on a windowsill. It does not need to satisfy any of your expectations. It's just sitting and being.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Baseline human awareness is not high enough to notice the Eternity of NOW. Human consciousness is deliberately time-bound to aid your survival.
</p>

<p>
	Eternity will only become noticable through practices or psychedelics. But Eternity is always the case. It is always NOW, NOW, NOW. Every temporal experience is actually eternal and has existed forever. But you aren't noticing it.
</p>

<p>
	You must realize that you are inside the Absolute at all times. The relative is actually the Absolute when looked at deeply enough.

<p>
	None of that comes anywhere close to 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Many Western enlightened masters have taken LSD. But LSD ain't good enough.
</p>

<p>
	Shinzen probably is open enough. But I would worry it might kill him. Him's pretty old.
</p>

<p>
	A full-on 5-MeO breakthrough is a terrifying thing. It will give you a panic attack.

<p>

<p>
	I offered it to Ralston. He refused, ridiculing me.

<p>
	Closedmindness is a hell of an obstacle to this work. A person with 40 years experience is also a know-it-all in his own mind.

	You need to find a unique and underserved need in the marketplace and invent a creative and effective solution for it, providing people with massive value.
</p>

<p>
	That is the heart of business. Everything else is distraction. What you eat and when you wake up is irrelevant. Business is a very concrete thing. Try not to muddy that with a bunch of cute self-help ideas or philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	"How can I add massive value to the world??" << that should be your top question when thinking about biz. If you're not adding real concrete massive value, you will not succeed.

		</p>

		<p>
			Most importantly, you mention in your video you can have certain experiences like out of body experiences, and you said “you won’t know what to do” .. so then what do you do during one? how do I know how to act or what to do?
		</p>

<p>
	Just wing it. You've can only figure stuff out like this by living through it.

<p>
	Your mind is very strong. Even after a terrifying experience you will return to homeostasis quite fast. A week later you will be back to normal in most cases.
</p>

<p>
	Your body and mind have automatic healing mechanisms. You're not some fragile vase.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Did I say that? If so, it was just a metaphor. Don't take it literally.
</p>

<p>
	This technique is not a replacement for meditation. Rather where it shines is in dredging up latent emotional baggage, which meditation does only very slowly.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation's primary purpose is not dredging up emotional baggage. You can spend years meditating, and become a good meditator, but you may still carry deep emotional baggage.

<title>Difference between being god before and after the death of the body</title>

Since your body is totally infinite and omnipresent. The human body is no more you than a brick wall. I was looking at a brick wall the other night and I could not tell the wall apart from my body. The wall is as much my body as my body.
</p>

<p>
	Being immortal is not about living forever through time. It is realizing that each moment is eternal already and that there is nowhere else for God to go. God cannot go anywhere because God is everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	You will not become enlightened. Rather enlightenment will reveal that your birth was just an idea, a story. The story of you will be erased. What will remain is omnipresent consciousness, which is God. Your perceptual field will be radically recontextualized and realized to be the body of God.
</p>

<p>
	You are not understanding just how radical enlightenment/God/no-self is! It's so radical you cannot imagine it, and it does not fit that materialistic paradigm you're using. That whole paradigm of a physical world will be wiped out at the moment of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	There never was a self.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

There is a clear biological stake people have in their offspring. Their progeny is in effect their own fucking cell!! They love themselves................! Now, this affection is no way near as strong from the other end, meaning the offspring's love for the parent doesn't even come anywhere close. Basically the children are part of the parents' bodies but not the other way around!! However, metaphysically speaking, sperm and egg might be all part of a big false narrative and in that case ALL the above goes out the window!!!

<p>
	What you have yet to realize is that the entire universe is your body, every grain of sand on every beach of every planet is your child.
</p>

<p>
	Not figuratively. Literally!
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing which is not your direct offspring.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize that, you will understand Absolute Love.
</p>

<p>
	Limiting yourself to your body is the grand illusion which we are here to overcome.
</p>

<p>
	This is the larger reality to which you are being pointed to.
</p>

<p>
	Discover Absolute Love and you will become a better parent too.

Lest your love be put to the test. Life can put you through some brutal tests. Many parents would break.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you love your child very much under all conditions. That's still such a narrow love. What about the other 1 billion children on this planet? Why don't you love them too?

<p>
	This is false.
</p>

<p>
	There is no suffering in manifestation other than what you add to it. If you cannot find lasting peace right now, you will never find it.
</p>

<p>
	You will not find nirvana anywhere but right here. Your job is to realize that this here and now is nirvana. Don't go looking for nirvana somewhere else or at some future point in time. Those stories are the thing keeping you from realizing nirvana.
</p>

<p>
	Nirvana is Truth, and Truth is NOW, NOW, NOW.

<p>
	Learning does not require blindly believing things. If you were serious, you'd be here to learn. But your cup is full and you're here to double down on your existing worldview, which is the opposite of the purpose of my teachings.
</p>

<p>
	If you do not want to learn from me, then you should not be here.
</p>

<p>
	Learning from me does not require blind belief. But it does require an open mind and a willingness to lay aside your existing worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Your choice of username betrayed your ideological position from day one. You are just here acting out a materialist program, like a robot. You are not questioning yourself but instead fighting externally.

Just in various forms. Sometimes twisted ones.
</p>

<p>
	Is a parent's love genuine love? Yes, but it is still quite narrow and conditional. There are many things your child can do which will make you stop loving it.
</p>

<p>
	And certainly not all parents love their children. Some parents are much better at it than others. But even the best parents still don't know what universal unconditional love is. They know love only within that narrow context of their child.
</p>

<p>
	Wait till you experience God's infinite universal unconditional love. Then you'll understand why I say that parental love (although good) is like a drop compared to an ocean.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I agree that parenting can be a big growing opportunity. But it will not deliver you to Absolute Love. That requires spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	What's really amazing is when you realize that murderers, thieves, and genocidal dictators are all acting out of love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is as diverse as all the objects in the universe.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I say that things I say is because I am trying to point you towards discovering Absolute Love -- a thing which you have not yet discovered.
</p>

<p>
	Past life regression is a common hypnosis technique. You could try that and see if anything interesting comes up. There's no guarantees.
</p>

<p>
	Other than that, hardcore yoga would be your best bet.
</p>

<p>
	Once you realize consciousness is all things, you'll understand that you/it will live through all possible points of view.
</p>

<p>
	Large doses of psychedelics also help. If you mega-dose some mushrooms you will see some crazy shit that will be totally out of this world. Be careful what you wish for. This is no joke. You are not ready to know such things.

<p>
	I grew up in a dysfunctional family. Not as dysfunctional as yours, but still.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing to do is move out and become as independent as possible. From there you can start collecting the pieces.
</p>

<p>
	Don't feel bad about leaving them. At your age you gotta learn to survive independently of them. This will also make you feel powerful rather than a victim.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry too much. You can overcome and heal all that childhood crap. It will take work, but it can be done for sure and you will later be grateful for that it taught you.

</p>

<p>
	I would recommend 1) distancing yourself from your family, limiting your contact with them at least for now, and 2) going to therapy to talk all this out. You don't want to keep traumatic stuff bottled up inside. You gotta talk it out so you get perspective and distance on it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics might also be very helpful, although also painful as they will force you to confront uncomfortable things. But in the end it will be healing. They can show you true love.
</p>

<p>
	If you live with your family your #1 priority should be to get a job and move out. That alone will help a lot.
</p>

			how do you know this is true though if you haven't had the experience of a zen master practicing for 40 years? I'm not saying you're wrong or even right but consider the qualities someone might have developed if they have been practicing intelligently and disciplined for 40 years. There may be a piece of the puzzle one has there that allows them to see things in a different way than others wont due to lack of experience and discipline.

<p>
	Some things in life you can only intuit. Not everything is absolute knowledge. We deal with a lot of uncertainties in this work because we never have perfect information. We cannot crawl into a person's head to know how awake they are. But we nevertheless have to make some assessments of it in order to determine who is worth learning from.
</p>

<p>
	I have interacted with and interviewed masters with 40 years of experience. And I see gaps in their understanding of reality/God. I feel like I have become conscious of some things they have not. Of course this is a grey area. It involves some guesswork.
</p>

<p>
	No doubt 40 years of discipline is a powerful thing and comes with many benefits which you could not get any other way. But it does not guarantee the highest levels of consciousness or understanding.

			What do you think of of the issue that by reading about all this stuff the psychedelics will just dig it out of your memory and bring it to the front. So how can you ever be sure that its an insight into the absolute and not just some random stuff that you then project the non-dual theory on?
		</p>

		<p>
			Isnt this the same thing that the materialist does, that he looks around the world and interprets and explains everything though his materialist model which in turn makes this model seem more and more true?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That sounds like it would be a big problem but in practice it just isn't because the psychedelic takes you so far beyond mental conceptual stuff.
</p>

<p>
	When you actually become infinite, it will be no theory.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics create a change in one's state of consciousness. This is very different from constructing models or doing analysis.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is absolute. It is not a memory or a projection. It cannot be doubted.

There are insights, there are states, and there is your baseline level of consciousness. All of them can be affected.
</p>

<p>
	You certainly cannot maintain a peak 5-MeO-DMT state because you would barely be able to walk. But it changes you even though you drop down. The sense of self is expended beyond your body.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, do both is the suggestion.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	No, you will not be anywhere close to that conscious. You will be lucky to get a few glimpses. But the value of the work is not just in getting glimpses. There's a lot more lessons than just enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Most of Peter's apprentices are not enlightened at all, not to even speak of deep enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Which is not to say anything negative about his programs. They are great. But you are grossly underestimating the amount of work it takes to awaken that deeply. I have watched his apprentices struggling and struggling and failing and failing to grasp what they are or what reality is.
</p>

<p>
	Not to brag, but I have awoken deeper than any of Peter's apprentices who I have met. And that is thanks to 5-MeO-DMT. Such degrees of consciousness would take you 40 years of work to attain.
</p>

<p>
	Total omniscience is possible. But you won't get that through any kind of apprenticeship program.
</p>

<p>
	Still, I recommend his programs. It's not the program's fault you are so asleep <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	If you're not using 5-MeO-DMT you're looking at 10, 20, 30, 40 years of work to reach the highest levels. The reality is, you will probably never even know you missed the highest levels because you will be so far away from them even after 40 years of work. Unless if you are supernaturally gifted. And that assumes you're working your ass off on this work, not just half-assing it the way most people do.
</p>

<p>
	It's still worth doing the work. So don't get discouraged. Just don't ignore the most powerful and direct tool there is for awakening. It would be negligent to do so.
</p>

<p>
	You will not understand Peter's full depth without psychedelic assistance, I can promise you that.
</p>

<p>
	None of this is to discourage you. Just the opposite, it just shows you how deep this work goes. So get excited! You have a lot of room for growth.
</p>

But you'd need massive, massive enlightenment for that.
</p>

<p>
	At the very center of the onion is God. If you fully become God, you will become a walking, talking vehicle for God's Love on Earth. Literally. You will walk around radiating God's Love to the whole world. Very few people get this far.
</p>

<p>
	You won't just be a vehicle for God, you will actually be the one true God. At this point your life is totally selfless and devoted to the betterment of all of living beings. Your love for the world will be infinite and you will be in paradise all the time. You will need nothing because you have become everything.

<p>
	The certification itself is basically irrelevant. What you really care about is finding the best program which teaches you how to be great coach and the business aspects of coaching.
</p>

<p>
	IPEC is the program I completed. It's quite good. It taught me valuable skills which I would not have learned any other way.
</p>

<p>
	Can't speak about any others since I only have experience with that one.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I have very little info about it.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like a decent spiritual community. Keep in mind that any community will be somewhat cult-like. But I don't think Isha is too bad. Although I don't know. The trick with real cults is that they hide their activities behind fake pleasant fronts. But from what I can sense about Sadhguru he is too responsible to allow Isha to be a proper cult. I don't think he would stand for it. After Sadhguru dies, then I would expect some serious problems to hit Isha as his followers wrestle for power with no authoritative voice like Sadhguru to guide them.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with building large organizations is that once the founder dies, it will easily get co-opted by devils and turned into a machine for devilry. That's one of the reasons I keep Actualized.org small.

According to my research, this is the case. Could be wrong. Just going off those who seem to be reputable chemists on the clearnet.

<p>
	You cannot extract 5-MeO-DMT from plants, which is how most N,N-DMT is made. Very few people synthesize N,N-DMT in a lab from scratch. It can be done but from what I know these methods are not readily known. And the precursor chemicals will be watched by government agencies who will arrest you for purchasing them.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bad idea to get involved with that.

The insights can be hard to make sense of.
</p>

<p>
	It helps very much to have a solid theoretical foundation in nonduality and spirituality beforehand. Which means reading lots of books and developing a theoretical framework. That helps me a lot. So when I trip and I see some new insight I can say, "Oh, hey, that's what that Zen master was talking about!" or, "Hey! That's what that yogi was talking about!"
</p>

<p>
	If you come into psychedelics with zero study, you will be so lost. You won't be able to make sense of it.
</p>

<p>
	Watching my videos should help a lot with this. People who trip need to watch my videos.
