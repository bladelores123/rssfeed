<p>
	Racism and reverse-racism are not equivalent. Likewise with feminism and toxic masculinity.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with false equivalency. It's a very popular form of self-deception these days.

	Hehe, enlightenment and love are identical.

<p>
	What you've truly longed for is a return to your true identity: as God

<p>
	Right now you are a devil. As a devil you suffer from the disconnection from God's Love. But you don't know how to stop being a devil. You're too scared to surrender your devilry. So you're caught in bind. On the one hand you want God and Love, on the other hand you cannot stand giving up your devilry.

<p>
	In other words, her and every other girl on the planet. LOL
</p>

<p>
	She's insecure that you'll leave her so she wants pretty stories about why she's special and why you'll never leave her.
</p>

<p>
	Of course don't tell her any of this, or she'll get upset. She doesn't want truth, she wants a fantasy. That's mostly what relationships are: mutually constructed fantasies of two people trying desperately to use one another to meet each others needs while desperately denying that this is what they're doing.
</p>

<p>
	Women don't like being complimented on their looks because they know that looks fade and there's always someone better looking around. They want to be complimented on unique personality traits.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta get more creative with your compliments.
</p>

<p>
	"I really like your pussy" is not a good compliment to a girl. Find unique things about her to compliment. Maybe even some of her flaws.

	Trump's wealth is fake. So unlike real billionaires, he probably actually needs the money to stay afloat.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is constantly losing money so he always needs new infusions.
</p>

<p>
	He lost $400 million of daddy's money.
</p>

<p>
	All his money is made from his brand name. So running for President was just a PR stunt to up his brand name.

</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately conservatives hate this idea. They want to punish such people because they are "evil-doers." It falls under their "law and order" dogma.
</p>

<p>
	They use this against liberals by saying, "Look, those crazy Communist liberals want to give heroin out in your neighborhood for free."

<p>
	It's confusing because it depends on how you define "you".

<p>
	What I meant in that video is that "Leo" is not in control. The control shifted from Leo to God in that moment.

<p>
	It's unlikely that they would get schizophrenia, multiple-personality disorder, or OCD because those all tend to be dysfunctions of the ego mind. To become enlightened in the first place the person would have to heal and transcend those dysfunctions.
</p>

<p>
	Alzheimer's is possible. It's basically just going to lower cognitive ability & memory.
</p>

<p>
	As you age you will lose some cognitive ability and memory no matter what. It's just a matter of degree. The peak for cognitive ability is about age 30. It's down hill from there.

	Control is a dualistic notion because it implies a controller and a controlled. In truth, the two are one.

<p>

<p>
	Put starkly, a "bad" thing is a thing which kills you. But once you're dead, how can anything be bad? If you cannot be harmed, bad cannot exist for you.
</p>

<p>
	Now the trick is becoming conscious that nothing can harm you. If you manage to crack that nut, you'll only see Goodness.
</p>

<p>
	God is that which cannot be harmed.
</p>

<p>
	How can a gun shoot itself? A gun can only shoot that which is not itself. If it turns out that there is nothing other to it, it cannot be harmed.

	Let's say I'm a kid in high school and I want to try some heroin to see if I like it. Under your ideal system, would I be able to go buy some legally from the government or from a pharmacy?
</p>

<p>
	If not, then there will be a black market and cartels.
</p>

<p>
	The problem I see with clinics currently is that they only cater to already addicted people, not to new customers.

			Osho would absolutely agree with me. He would say something along the lines of, you cannot fight something created by the mind (toxic masculinity) with something created by the mind (toxic feminism). Can only shine light on the darkness. Your not going to fix machismo by shunning machismo. Only by giving these men the love that they need and are lacking so much in this day and age, will toxic masculinity be healed.

<p>
	The difference is, toxic feminism is something your mind created.
</p>

<p>
	Feminism just seeks equal rights. Yet you perceive that as toxic because it threatens your identity.

<p>
	Definitely, definitely. Low consciousness politicians always use the most base survival threats to win elections.

<p>
	Toad venom is at least 3x to 5x less potent per mg. So be sure to factor that into your calculus.
</p>

<p>
	1 gram of synthetic is worth about 3-5 grams of toad venom.

<p>
	A special attachment is formed which feels irreplaceable, yet it is replaceable and there's nothing objectively more special about one person than another.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same as love for one's children. Your children seem special, but honestly, they are no more special than any hungry kid off the street. If you were truthful you'd admit it.
</p>

<p>
	The ego creates this massive bias for the purposes of its survival. It's the epitome of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	You need to lie to yourself that your children are special, otherwise there'd be no compelling reason to protect them from annihilation.

<p>
	So what? This doesn't contradict the law.
</p>

<p>
	When understanding such spiritual laws, you have to understand them holistically, not in this nitpicky way of yours. The law does not say that you can't have some accident befall you. Something else is being said.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than trying to debunk the law, try to understand what it is trying to communicate to you.

<p>
	I would add <strong>Universal Law #6:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Everything that happens is a manifestation of Love. No exceptions.
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot see how this is so, broaden your perspective until you see how it is so. Inability to see it demonstrates a narrowness of perspective.

I could meditate for 30 years and not come anywhere near the deepest realizations I've had on psychedelics. Maybe somebody could do it, but not me.

<p>
	When I look around at most enlightenment teachers, I find their teachings to be shallower than the things I've realized on psychedelics.

<p>
	But what I'm telling you is, awakenings can occur at any stage. They will then be filtered and understood through the lens of that stage.

<p>
	This notion of "full enlightenment" that you guys like to use is absurd. It's sloppy and creates many foolish conclusions.

			In China they have their own local Google -- 10 Cents, for instance. And other IT giants. And they do well, even though "it's China". How come? In Russia there's Yandex which is also succesful. In Israel there're many IT companies. All works and does so successfully. In all these countries, you imply, the society isn't as conscious and developed on the Spiral Dynamics Level as in the US. Then how does all that exist then and generates profits?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Are you seriously comparing a company like Yandex or Baidu to Google? They are not evem in the same ballpark.
</p>

<p>
	A company like Google simply could not exist in China or Russia.
</p>

<p>
	Google is a highly advanced, conscious company. You don't even realize. They put enormous effort and resources in retaining worldclass talent. Google goes way beyond generating a profit. It is a whole different paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Any fool can be successful, but only Google is Google.

		<p>
			I'd rather work in Thailand or Singapore or Turkey, for instance, where I can grab fresh fruits <strong>on the street</strong>, <strong>sold by individuals</strong>, for $0.5-1 USD and fresh prepared 1 liter of juice for 1-2 USD. In Singapore more expensive.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the US I'd have to go to supermarket and buy that for how much? 10 times more expensive, right? In a plastic container. The quality would worse becase it's sold in a supermarket and from a refrigerator, with, possibly, chemicals.
		</p>

		<p>
			Or even in India - they have great, cheap and heathy food.
		</p>

		<p>

<p>
	You grossly romanticize these 3rd world countries. No serious people want to live there because of how much they suck in ways you can't yet imagine. These countries are corrupt to hell, full of toxic chemicals, censorship, and many other problems. The food is cheap because it's toxic junk and no one wants to live there.
</p>

<p>
	If all you value is cheapness, then sure, those countries look appealing. But people who generate serious income have way higher standards.
</p>

<p>
	The development level of a country is directly related to the development level of a company like Google, which is an advanced stage Green company. It would never have arisen in China or India.

<p>
	Take a look at Osho. He was obsessed with materialistic luxury even though he was supposedly very enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Take a look a Zen monks during WWII. They supported fascism and Japanese nationalism, even though they were supposedly enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Being awake does not mean you have an advanced mind or an advanced value system.

</p>

<p>
	Many stage Blue yogis have an ethnocentric worldview. They could be very partial to Indian culture, holding it as superior to all other cultures. Even Sadhguru seems to not be immune to this trap to some degree.
</p>

<p>
	Oddly enough, you can be conscious of Universal Love but still be a racist or misogynist. Childhood attitudes tend to run deep and enlightenment will not necessarily transform them automatically.

<p>
	That's what psychedelics are for.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it won't last. You can't ever be a kid again. You know too much now.
</p>

<p>
	You also over-romanticize how great it was to be a kid. It wasn't as great as you remember because your mind filters out all the bad stuff.

	Not the ego. Mostly it resides in your bodily urges. Similar to food. Hunger does not reside in the ego. It is more fundamental. The body likes whatever it likes. Don't over think it.

	That's an illusion. You'll see.
</p>

<p>
	She is precisely replaceable. Not only that, but you WILL replace her.
</p>

<p>
	But for a short while you'll suffer. Because that's the nature of irrational attachment. Notice that when you put something up on a pedestal in your mind, you create your own suffering.
</p>

<p>
	The whole key to dating women is: Don't get attached to her AT ALL until at least you sleep with her. Any attachment you create before that will only create needless suffering and usually ends up ensuring you never sleep with her.
</p>

<p>
	All romantic love is pure illusion. It's as illusory as jerking off to a celebrity in your mind. Only here you're using a real person to jerk off into -- which allows you to fool yourself into thinking it is real. Nope. Still pure fantasy.

<p>
	Stay calm. Give it a few days. It will pass and you'll forget all about it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics don't last more than a day or two. Anything else is your own mind at work, perhaps shadow material arising. The substance is certainly long gone from your system.
</p>

<p>
	Not that I recommend it, but you could always distract yourself with a TV show or a video game after a bad trip. That can help to take the mind off it until the memories fade away. Memories of a trip significantly fade after 1 week and after a month it's hard to recall much at all.

	Las Vegas is a great city. Everything you need with none of the smog and traffic. And good weather most of the year except summer. Close to many national parks. Zero state income tax. The city itself is quite liberal.

<title>Drugs Legalization in Poor Countries</title>

<p>
	Most drugs are illegal because parents are terrified of their kids doing heroin, crack, cocaine, & meth. And to be fair, this is a legitimate concern. These drugs can be extremely destructive. I have an extended relative in Russia who's a life long heroin addict. He's spent a few years in prison and still does heroin. It's ruined his whole life and he's a huge drag on his family because he cannot maintain a job.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics got lumped in with all that.
</p>

<p>
	The issue of heroin, crack, cocaine, & meth is tricky. How should we regulate such drugs? Do we allow them to be sold at the pharmacy? Do we ban them, creating a black market? It's bad either way. Ideally we raise the quality of our society such that people never want to do those hard drugs. But that's going to take centuries of growth. In the meantime it will be a problem either way.
</p>

<p>
	People who get hooked on hard drugs usually don't have much of a life and little hope for a good future. They lack a positive life purpose to work towards. Society needs to provide people with more opportunities for success.
</p>

<p>
	One thing is clear though, psychedelics need to be legalized and actually put to use for helping those hooked on heroin, crack, cocaine, & meth. That's a no-brainer. It's proven to work.
</p>

<p>
	I've never snorted oxalate, but snorting HCl is quite unpleasant. The only thing that takes the edge off is the epic nature of the trip itself. The whole process is inferior to plugging.

	Get your blood work done. Check your thyroid and hormones. Many people have thyroid or hormone imbalances. Low energy is often associated with under-active thyroid.
</p>

<p>
	Of course cleaning up your diet is very important. If you eat shit you will feel like shit. Stop eating all wheat products and all junk food. Carb heavy foods make you extra sleepy.
</p>

<p>
	You should also do a urine test for heavy metal toxicity. Heavy metals like mercury and lead cause all sorts of energy problems. There are detox protocols for detoxing heavy metals if you have them.

<p>
	If we injected snake venom into your veins, you'd also lose some control.
</p>

<p>
	Physiology is more fundamental than your ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	More fundamentally, the whole notion of "control" is deeply dualistic and delusional.
</p>

<p>
	If there exists only one thing in the universe: the universe itself, who controls it? Who controls the universe?

<p>
	It already IS extremely appealing for corporations. Corporations are making a killing. They ain't going anywhere. These are empty threats. They only ship the lowest jobs overseas. Management lives here for a good reason.
</p>

<p>
	What you gotta see is that a popular country has enormous leverage over corporations. A popular country has what the corporations want most: 1) a big market of consumers, and 2) the top talent in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck running Google in China or Brazil. The world's best computer engineers don't want to live in China or Brazil when they could be living in the Bay Area. The best talent comes from high consciousness societies. This is not an accident. That's the whole point of a constructing a high consciousness society.

Seems to work fine for them.
</p>

<p>
	The problem in Brazil is massive corruption, lack of infrastructure, and low levels of Spiral development across the populace. Brazil has a lot of stage Red which makes progressive reforms very difficult.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Red will behave criminally regardless of drugs being legal or illegal.
</p>

<p>
	It's very easy to acquire drugs in Brazil if you want. So it's not like it is being stopped under current policy.

<p>
	I am not for isolation. Globalism will only grow larger.
</p>

<p>
	But people will want to live in the most developed and conscious countries. The whole point is to make America extremely appealing to live in -- much more appealing than now.
</p>

<p>
	Expecting American citizens to pay taxes is not isolationism. If you don't want to pay taxes, fine. Then surrender your citizenship. To not pay your fair share of taxes is literally leeching off your community. It is the most unpatriotic thing you could do. Basically it's treason.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if tax evasion was tried in court as treason.

<p>
	By your logic the US should not have child labor laws because it would be bad for companies and they would just move overseas and exploit children there.
</p>

<p>
	You are thinking about this all wrong. The point of these policies is to create a more healthy, conscious, loving society. This comes at the cost of maximization of profits and growth. This is a big shift in paradigm. A more conscious society will become more powerful than all other societies in the long term even if it doesn't maximize profits. Precisely BECAUSE it doesn't maximize profits!
</p>

<p>
	You cannot even begin to imagine how powerful America would become if we passed all these changes I propose. Consciousness and Love is the ultimate power.

<p>
	I don't see rich people moving overseas a problem.
</p>

<p>
	Rich people want to live in America and benefit from American real estate, schools, and society. They do not want to live in a 3rd world country. They don't want their children living in a 3rd world rat hole.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise, giant corporations want to be headquartered here. To do serious business here, they must be here.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, under current law, if you are a US citizen and you move to another country, you still owe the IRS income tax. If you want to escape US income tax, you have to renounce your citizenship.
</p>

<p>
	It's very easy to pass some laws that further tighten this. If a corporation over $1 billion wants to do business in the US, they must place a headquarters here.
</p>

<p>
	The Chinese do not allow any America company to work in China without partnering with a local Chinese company first.
</p>

<p>
	Silicon Valley is not going to pack their stuff and move overseas. They don't even want to move to Alabama, let alone overseas.
</p>

<p>
	See Russia or North Korea or Iraq for more modern examples of Red.

	Saddam Hussein is a great example.

<p>
	No it would not because people like to live in uncorrupted countries with great infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
	People in the US like to move to the most progressive states like California, Washington, New York. Why is it that no one dreams of moving to Alabama?

It's like having a discussion with a man-child. There's no historical understanding there of how government works. Just ravings about how evil government is.
</p>

<p>
	These positions are often held by young juvenile white males. It's a rebellious phase they grow through. Unfortunately some get stuck on it for life.

<p>
	Wind is not even necessary. Everything can be solar. Solar is the ultimate energy source because it is virtually unlimited. We just need more cells and batteries, which will naturally happen.
</p>

<p>
	We can install solar panels on every rooftop in the world. This is the future. Solar is only going to get cheaper and more efficient.

<p>
	Coal and nuclear is already going out of business. With a proper carbon tax, solar will become king.

<p>
	I explained it a lot in my video: What Is Love?
</p>

<p>
	And we'll certainly talk more about it in future episodes. But talking about it is also quite pointless. You cannot understand Love through talk. You must find it by doing the practices. You must open your heart.
</p>

<p>
	What good does it do for me to tell you that everything is love? It's as useless as telling people that they are God. Telling people doesn't work. They must awaken to it.

	Reading an explanation in a book doesn't help because that's just begging the question. That book then becomes your new dogma. You need to find a way to determine which books you can trust. You cannot do that based on my recommendations because do you not know if I am correct or not.

<p>
	The pursuit of truth must be independent of all human sources.

			See.. what i'm asking is not what is true. I'm asking what from religion is not just people hallucinating <span>🤭 or Interpreting stuff wrong.</span>

<p>
	That's very wide question. A whole book could be written about that because there is so much stuff religions say.
</p>

<p>
	God, for example, is not a dogma. But! For most religious people it is.
</p>

<p>
	Dogma is not just about true vs false, dogma is about how you hold it. If a perosn holds a true thing as a belief which he has no direct experience of, it's still a dogma.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you are absolutely sure the Earth is round, that's a dogma, even if the Earth turns out to be round once you look down on it from orbit.
</p>

<p>
	But if you have actually seen the round Earth with your own eyes, then it's not a dogma.
</p>

Most people have no idea what their values are so it takes digging.

			That's a valid point. Would you say that the only way for a society of 500 million people to live in total harmony is if everyone is stage yellow and beyond?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I doubt total harmony is possible. Total harmony is death. There will always be stuggle in life. That's the nature of survival. It's just a question of how much harmony and complexity a particular stage of cognitive development can sustain.
</p>

<p>
	China is mosty stage Blue and they have over 1 billion people. Of course they are an ecological disaster, but they do live in some degree of harmony as a society.

Or can someone become conscious of Absolute Love without knowing their true nature?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Absolute Love is idenetical to your true nature.
</p>

<p>
	There are facets to the Absolute. These facets can be realized in any order and at various levels of comprehensiveness.
</p>

<p>
	But don't be confused, all of these facets are identical to one another in the end. But even so, it is important to realize them individually. It is not enough to realize one facet and think you automatically understand all the rest, even though they are one in the end.
</p>
