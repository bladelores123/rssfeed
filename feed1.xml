<p>
	No. Like I said, certain kinds of concepts are very useful for avoiding traps. Green falls into many spiritual traps.
</p>

<p>
	Yellow is in a better position to pursue enlightenment than Green. Green is still way too tribal and Tier 1.
</p>

<p>
	You can pursue enlightenment at any stage.

		<p>
			So in that case if you can't actually experience the thing creating the thoughts then what would make you so sure it's not the brain cause you can't feel the brain either. that's where I'm having a problem with your notion of brains don't exist. 
		</p>

<p>
	There is no thing that creates thoughts. Thoughts arise within emptiness. Everything arises within emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot "experience" emptiness with the senses. But you can be conscious of it. Because it is consciousness. Emptiness is self-aware. That's what existence is.

<p>
	Well, if you don't want an LP, then why you taking the course?
</p>

<p>
	That's like enrolling in a business class and saying, "But I don't want to run a business."
</p>

<p>
	Don't do things just because I tell you. You must be intrinsically motivated to do them.
</p>

<p>
	Follow your passion. Not my words.

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	The exception being that you will need some degree of conceptual understanding to avoid the traps common to the spiritual path.
</p>

<p>
	Concepts are both your key out of the prison, and they are the prison itself.

<title>Having a healthy ego, is that even a thing?</title>

<p>
	A healthy ego is something like you see in Barack Obama. An unhealthy ego something like you see in Donald Trump.
</p>

<p>
	An unhelathy ego is very insecure, clingy, greedy, closed, manipulative, dishonest, and well... self-centered. A healthy ego is the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	Braden's work is a great way to move from unhealthy to healthy ego.
</p>

<p>
	But it will not lead to ego-transcendence. That requires deeper teachings.

<p>
	Alpha, although the deepest meditation for purposes of nonduality is not measured by a single wavelength but a phase sync of alpha and theta. You won't find an audio to do that one. You have to train your mind to sync the peaks of alpha and theta, which requires an EEG machine, which is too complicated to go into here.
</p>

<p>
	Theta beats are good for purifying trauma and shadow work.

<title>Question about biocentricism</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<p>
	Firstly, the universe does not exist inside a brain. The notion of "the brain" is itself part of the notion "the universe"! So the universe cannot exist inside a brain because that would be like saying the universe exists inside the universe, which is just silly.
</p>

<p>
	The universe exists as a hallucination, nowhere! Not in any brain. Reality occurs nowhere, nowhen. Reality is an impossible object.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, the past is a concept. There is no such thing as the past. There is only the eternal present which the ego-mind misinterprets as past and future because it is deluded. Everything in reality has already occurred, simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, with your talk about McDonalds, you are speaking about the relative domain, which is the domain of Maya, the domain inside the dream. Inside the dream you must play by the dream's rules. In this dream, the rules are: if you eat McDonalds (which is an illusion), your body (which is an illusion) will deteriorate (which is an illusion) and you will die (which is an illusion).
</p>

<p>
	When the only reality is illusion, illusions feel very "real" because you have no other point of reference.
</p>

<p>
	Your death feels like a very serious event precisely because your life is an illusion!
</p>

<p>

<title>No time/energy to do self actualizing work?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/23350-no-timeenergy-to-do-self-actualizing-work/?do=findComment&amp;comment=258348</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/8685-psyche_92/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="8685" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/8685-psyche_92/" rel="">@Psyche_92</a> Yes, this is a huge problem.
</p>

<p>
	What plan could you make to restructure your life so that you have significantly more time for self-actualization work?
</p>

<p>
	This will probably involve making some radical structural changes, like re-thinking your entire career. This will involve some tough choices. And that is precisely how growth happens: tough choices, strategy, and emotional labor. You must be strategic and position yourself long-term so that you have more free time. If that means you spend 2 years re-training yourself for a new job, for example, then that's what you must do.
</p>

<p>
	When I was in your shoes, I decided to quit my career and start my own business just so that I had the free time and money to do what I needed to do. It took me a 3-4 year detour to get my first business stabilized before I could really dig into my life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	Working 10 hours per day simply will not work. It's a terrible strategy that you must now figure a way out of. Not only does it preclude self-actualization work, it will destroy your health and well-being in the long-term.
</p>

<p>
	Work smarter, not harder.
</p>

<p>
	After years of strategically laying my groundwork I now have the freedom to not work for 10 years without any financial problems. That's what good strategy will yield. I could retire and go meditate for 1 year straight without any worries, come back, and still be richer than when I left. This situation did not happen by accident! I deliberately designed it this way because I realized a long time ago that freedom was the #1 variable to living the kind of life I envision. It's very hard to self-actualize when you are a wage slave.

<title>Would Be Grateful for Help with Stage Yellow Confusion</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/23352-would-be-grateful-for-help-with-stage-yellow-confusion/?do=findComment&amp;comment=258347</link>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/11689-treejeff/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="11689" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/11689-treejeff/" rel="">@TreeJeff</a> You basically got it right.
</p>

<p>
	The realities of real-world politics and government are extremely complex, messy, and difficult. When you go to apply Spiral Dynamics in the US political system, for example, all hell will break loose. All your lofty Yellow ideals will the tarred and feathered. You will be called a pedophile, a charlatan, and worse. And even if you succeed in getting elected President or Senator, or whatever, since you are not an absolute monarch, your power to change policy will be extremely limited because you have to work with all the other parties in power, who will not be at Yellow, and will look at you like a leper.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what color stage you are at, or even if you are totally enlightened like the Buddha himself, if you were President of the US you would have to make incredibly painful choices that would involve the deaths of hundreds or even thousands of people REGARDLESS of your choice! This would be true even for a fully enlightened Turquoise leader! This is the part about governance that laypeople do not understand: simply because of the scale of a country like the US -- 330 million people -- most decisions will result in deaths of tens, hundreds, or thousands. Just by deciding to remove regulations on car pollution, you will kill people. Just by deciding to fund an infrastructure program, you will kill people. And so on.
</p>

<p>
	A Yellow leader understands all this. So does a Turquoise leader. Yellow and Turquoise leaders are mature enough to understand that their actions will result in many deaths, which is why they would take their job very seriously and work very hard to make the best decisions possible. They would also know that their decisions could save tens of thousands of lives relative to a Tier 1 leader.
</p>

<p>
	Being Yellow, Turquoise, or enlightened does not mean you will be a flawless leader whose policies please everyone and hurt no one. People will get killed and hurt under the watch. They will even get killed and hurt by your highest ideals and most noble policy changes.
</p>

<p>
	Those are the harsh reality of governance. Which is precisely why we need highly conscious leaders in power, not people like Trump, who's actions will result in harm to millions as he approaches policy in an ignorant, simple-minded, and narcissistic manner.
</p>

<p>
	And BTW, the people will also hate you because they are at Blue, Orange, and Green, and you as Yellow will not satisfy their bloodthirsty tribal desires to attack the enemy color. So as Yellow, even if you succeed, at least 1/3rd of the country will think of you as a traitorous devil.
</p>

<p>
	Still want to be leader?
</p>

<p>
	I have warned you guys against idealized notions of enlightenment many times. You are setting yourselves up for disappointment and some rude awakenings with all this "true enlightenment is perfect" stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be surprised when you see your "truely enlightened" guru pissing in your soup.

This notion of "unconditionally loving" is a pipe dream. In practice, people are still people and they still have many petty issues, including shadow issues, bad habits, and cultural conditioning of which they are unconscious despite their enlightenment. And on top of all that, there is still development, which is a separate thing. You might be loving but undeveloped.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment does NOT make you a moral person. We have discussed this issue to death. Being a good person is a lot harder than enlightenment.

<p>
	A person can be truly enlightened, but undeveloped. And vice versa.

<p>
	Technically, enlightenment is accessible at any stage of the Spiral.

<title>Obama - The best example of yellow</title>

<p>
	In this video he sounds more Orange/Green to me than Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	The whole problem is that you precisely CANNOT agree on facts. There is no such thing as facts. All facts are dependent on your interpretation and stage of development.
</p>

<p>
	Every color lives in its own reality and has its own facts.
</p>

<p>
	Blue facts are not Orange facts are not Green facts are not Yellow facts are not Turquoise facts.
</p>

<p>
	 Without understanding this crucial point, the complexity of this problem will be underestimated, as Obama underestimates it.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue will not accept Orange & Green "facts". So what do you do then?
</p>

<p>
	How do you deal with a Blue person who believes black people have inferior IQ and Muslim people are terrorists?
</p>

<p>
	Designing with the entire Spiral in mind is no easy thing.

<p>
	My audience isn't only young. I've had people email me with testimonials who are in their 60's and even 70's who are finding their life purpose and self-actualizing. It's just the nature of YT that it skews towards a younger demo.
</p>

<p>
	Some of the Mods here are in their 40s and 50s.
</p>

<p>
	What difference does it make?
</p>

<p>
	A good insight is a good insight.
</p>

<p>
	And if you feel I am not addressing issues specific enough to 60 year olds, there are plenty of older gurus on YT you could follow.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, whatever age you are, you cannot change it. So might as well accept it and just get to work self-actualizing. What else is there to do in life?
</p>

You can have nondual states at low levels of mental development. You can be a devout Blue Christian who has nondual experiences and interprets them as Christ consciousness but it still ethocentric and highly partial to Christianity, denoucing Buddhism and Islam as devil worship.
</p>

<p>
	To be able to integrate lots of various worldviews and to be globalist vs enthocentric does NOT come automatically with nondual states. It takes great mental development to be able to stand outside your cultural biases and programming.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you become fully enlightened, your mind will still be filled with cultural programming and biases. And it will not automatically understand all the other traditions in the world without study. You can be enlightened and yet still totally ignorant of Islam or Hinduism or science, and how they all interconnect.
</p>

<p>
	If Jesus was alive today, he might not look too kindly upon Buddhism or Islam.
</p>

<p>
	If you were raised Christian, you will probably have a strong preference to interpret enlightenment in a way that's favorable to that tradition. There will still be subtle bias. Just like if you were raised in a scientific household, you will be biased towards scientific explanations of enlightenment. You will talk about neuroscience and evolution and so on.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out. These are all traps!
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment alone will NOT make you Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	It wasn't even really a decision. My #1 goal as a living being has always simply been to understand what reality is. It is not even a deliberate goal I set. It is more like a deep natural curiosity about life. And from there, when I heard about enlightenment, it was just naturally the most important thing to pursue. There is not even a choice for me whether to pursue it or not. There's only the question of: How fast, how seriously? And via which method?
</p>

<p>
	You pursue it despite fears and inhibitions. Don't wait for them to disappear.
</p>

<p>
	It has never even crossed my mind that I will not pursue enlightenment. To me that would be like throwing away the greatest gift in the universe.
</p>

<p>
	Just start doing Kriya yoga everyday and psychedelics. The rest should take care of itself.
</p>

<title>Does character ever change?</title>

<p>
	Character becomes more and more purified and authentic.
</p>

<p>
	Because most people have been so brainwashed by culture, their true character has become so corrupted and obscured that just through lots of purification it can appear as though the character changed a lot, when really all that happened was a polishing of this diamond in the rough.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine an ancient archeological object which is covered in 5 layers of grime and rust. Once you strip all that crap away, the original object will finally be revealed. And it could look very different than you first imagined. But also, the shape is still basically the same.

</p>

<p>
	Xrays, airplanes, electromagnetism, computers, radiation, wireless communication -- all of this would have been considered paranormal 500 years ago. You materialists are blind to how your mind is shifting the goal posts and taking reality for granted.
</p>

<p>
	The distinction between natural and supernatural phenomena is a fiction your own mind constructed. Everything is supernatural.
</p>

<p>
	The statistical evidence of ESP is extraordinary in its volume.
</p>

<p>
	If you're quoting Carl Sagan or Sam Harris, you really haven't seriously investigated the epistemic and metaphysical foundations of the science and rationalism which you believe in so blindly. You're doing religion 2.0.
</p>

<p>
	Rationality in the hands of a fool is a dangerous thing.

<p>
	Experience does not actually exist. What you presently call "my experience" is actually Absolute Infinity. But the ego cannot see this because it believes that you were actually born. The ego is misinterpreting being as experience because of its selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is a giant ball of concepts which includes the concept "me", "my life", "my experience", etc. All of that falls away with the collapse of the ego such that only raw being remains. Life ceases to belong to you. You realize that your birth is just an idea. It never actually happened. You were not born physically, you are born conceptually.
</p>

<p>
	"I was born physically" << that's your conceptual birth!

<p>
	The hard scientific statistical data for paranormal phenomena is beyond doubt. The problem is, no materialist wants to take it seriously, so the data falls on deaf ears.
</p>

<p>
	The bottleneck isn't lack of evidence, it's lack of openmindedness.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is too uncomfortable for materialist to stomach, as it would spell doom for materialism. So they just stick their head in the sand. Just like religious folks do about evolution. Same old game replayed in new ways. Nothing original or surprising about it. This is paradigm lock.

<p>
	Being is prior to knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	Turns out that knowledge is actually impossible.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot know anything because the thing you are using to accomplish the knowing is itself unknowable.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're trying to use a knife to cut itself.

			Still, enlightenment isn't going to bring me anything worthwhile, and will cost me everything. To put my dilemma into context, I've sacrificed relationships, career aspirations, all kinds of sensual pleasure (sex, food, partying), hobbies, the list goes on. I might as well end up spending my life staring at a wall. And for what? So I can release the need for my life to have meaning? So I don't have to deal with the downs of life? Sounds like a wholesale rejection of life to me. I got into self-actualisation because I wanted to live my life to the full, to make the most of it. This is basically the opposite, isn't it?

	"I", "I", "I", "I"....

<p>
	Every time you write the word "I", it's a lie.

<p>
	"But I need..." << LIE!
</p>

<p>
	"But I just think..." << LIE!

	"But I will have to sacrifice..." << LIE!

</p>

<p>
	The question is: how deep was your awakening really?
</p>

<p>
	The early awakenings tend to not be deep.
</p>

<p>
	At the deepest levels, not only the self, but reality itself will collapse.

There are many solutions available.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, mastering financial independence is challenging. But it's also highly worthwhile and an exciting opportunity for growth.
</p>

<p>
	I was in your shoes 10 years ago. I got fired from my first job in 1 day. Then a month later I found a much better job. And a year later I quit even that job and started my own biz and worked for myself for 10 years. Those first 5 years of doing biz were really exciting and scary times. Without that, Actualized.org would never have been possible.
</p>

<p>
	So keep the hope and really work the problem.

<p>
	Get a job and move out. Until then, you're in a coping holding pattern.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to break free of your family and forge your own life. Then you can set all the rules and values.
</p>

<p>
	In your early 20's the #1 priority should be to master making a living for yourself so you are not anyone's slave, including not your boss's slave.

<title>Why morality isn't a mere concept</title>

<p>
	Here's a simple thought experiment for you moralists:
</p>

<p>
	If we program a robot with a rule which says: "Do not kill robots" does that make this rule have any objective validity? If we program the robot to feel guilty for killing a robot, does that make it any more objective?
</p>

<p>
	What if we program another robot with the opposite rule? Which one of them is right? Based on who's criteria?
</p>

<p>
	Hey, ya'll, I need your help!
</p>

<p>
	I want to create a comprehensive list of video examples of prototypical stage Turquoise thinking.
</p>

<p>
	This is meant to be an educational tool for people learning about Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	So towards that end, scour Youtube and find all the videos you can which exhibit stage Turquoise thinking. Try to find videos which are short and sweet. The more diversity we can display here, the better. Try to find examples from various cultures.
</p>

<p>
	We will create a mega-thread like this for every stage in the Spiral, from Red to Turquoise. But here, let's just focus on Turquoise. Each week I will start a new mega-thread topic for the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	Do not start a political debate in this thread! It is not our goal here to defend our personal political positions or to judge any stage, but simply to compile examples.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for your help! I'm excited to see what kind of juicy stuff you dig up. Try to be selective with your choices.
</p>

<p>
	This can turn into a really cool list.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			The colloquial meaning of "True" is something like "in accordance with my experience of reality". This is obviously a grossly facile concetualization.
		</p>

		<p>
			What "Truth" means, in a strict sense, has been a central point of contention among philosophers for millenia, for good reason. "Truth" seems  to to be one of those truely acaleptic concepts, without any plausible consensus-conceptualization. 
		</p>

		<p>
			A few uncontroversial (and insipid) statements about truth:
		</p>

		<p>
			Some pedantic teutologies like "Every apple is an apple" and "1 = 1" seems incontestably true.
		</p>

		<p>
			A cartesian contention of the type "subjective experiences exists" seems incontestably true.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then there's socially constructed, definitional truths of the type "two" is defined as "the sum of one pluss one" => It is true that "1 + 1 = 2" within the context of this edifice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Organons like the laws of logic are mostly assumed to be true, but are occationally challenged.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any deeper/more interesting claims about truth thruth tends to be fraught with speculative assumptions, contrived definitions poorly maping onto the concept of "Truth" or just plain old sophistry.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Be careful with all of these Western philosophical notions of truth. They are not Truth with capital T.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to see Truth with a capital T, just silently look around the room you're in right now. You're looking at Truth. But you're not fully conscious of just what it is yet because ego it taking this room as "my experience", which is a subtle conceptualization still.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is exactly what's right in front of you. Train your awareness right on it and hold it there for a long time without moving. Just silently observe the Truth. Connect with the mystery of existence.
</p>

<p>
	Your body is made of Truth, the floor is made of Truth, the coffee table is made of Truth, etc. The question is, what the hell is it? It ain't molecules or atoms. It ain't even experience. What is it?
</p>

	In this work you are not after a "picture of reality" you are after pure reality itself, which means all picture must be discarded.
</p>

<p>
	If you want pictures of reality, go study science. Inquiry is not about pictures. It's about BEING reality.
</p>

<p>
	This notion you have of "reality" has to go. It's just a concept. Deconstruct it. What is this thing you call "reality"? Notice it's just an idea. What you see in your direct experience is prior to your notions of "reality".
</p>

<p>
	Strip all knowing from the present moment until you are just left sitting in your room with no idea what anything is. Even remove the idea that you are alive, sitting in a room. Or that were ever born. Strip it all off! Try to get to pure raw sensation without any ideas or images of what it is. Don't worry about missing out on reality. Everything that is true is independent of interpretation or images in the mind.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is, you do not know what anything is. Period. Try to get your mind to see this. Don't just think it, experience this not-knowing.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest reasons you are stuck is because you have an image of "an external reality" in your mind. You are taking this image to be reality when it is not. This image must go.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possiblity that there is no such thing as external reality in the same way that there is no such thing as Santa Claus.

<title>The 5-MeO-DMT Mega-Thread</title>

You would need to be an organic chemist with tens of thousands of dollars of lab equipment to extract it successfully. It is a very delicate molecule. It seems easier to synthesize than to extract. And you'd need to be a good chemist to synthesize it too, with costly lab equipment.
</p>

<p>
	Also, 5-MeO is not really a motivational tool. It will likely have the exact opposite effect: it will show you that your entire life is a meaningless lie. Although discovering God was very motivating for me. But for many people it would be more terrifying than motivating.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be better off starting with something like LSD and see how you handle that. You could do years of work just with LSD.

<p>
	That is super-typical of Blue thinking. It's not even ugly from their perspective because they really believe in the whole good guys vs bad guys narrative. And of course, we are always the good guys so we can do no wrong.
</p>

<p>
	The lack of compassion comes from lack of exposure to the "bad guys".
</p>

<p>
	Excellent example!

<title>What is truth?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Under this premise, your face does not exist unless you are looking at it. And even when you are looking at it in a mirror, it still is not "yours" or "a face" because those are concepts, not direct experience. Notice that under this premise even the notion of "Truth" is not real but conceptual. Notice further than even the notion "real" isn't real!
</p>

<p>
	The first most important distinction to make is between concept/thought & actual experience.
</p>

<p>
	But then inquire further.
</p>

<p>
	By deconstructing your web of materialistic beliefs your experience will ultimately become recontextualized into Absolute Being.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute in none other than what is in your direct experience right now once you strip off all the concepts. But there are a lot of concepts to strip off. Way more than you can presently imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will help you see the Truth directly. Which will then help self-inquiry and deconstruction.
</p>

<p>
	Truth cannot be spoken because it is the the sum total of everything that is the case. You could say that Truth is the physical substrate of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with trying to conceptualize or imagine Truth. All concepts and images take you away from Truth or Being.
</p>

<p>
	That's probably because your mental image of Green is too caricatured, too stereotypical. By which I mean you're thinking of Green as some pot-smoking hippie wearing Native American feather earrings and a peace symbol necklace. That kind of person probably is Green, but that's not the only version of Green that exists.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a set of values, not some stereotypical hippie image.
</p>

<p>
	My political value set is very Green. I very much care about equality, egalitarianism, and the excesses of capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	I'm also very big into relativity. My notions of relativity are more extreme than most post-modernist academics.
</p>

<p>
	I just don't wear my Green on my sleeves, and being a lone-wolf type of guy, I don't participate in any kind of mob mentality or group activities which many Green people indulge in. Even during group meditation retreats I never meditate with the group. I meditate alone.
</p>

<p>
	I've had a Green value set ever since I was like 10 years old. I never really cared about money, I cared more about peace and art.

			2. There is no such thing as "post-rationalist", sure it's sexy statement, but it does not exist, everything is logical , and I am talking about Logic in very broad sense , I am not referring to Formal Logic or Mathematics, so I am talking about reason, you can't argue against reason because you need reason to argue in the first place, if you say logic is bad because , for example : Gödel's incompleteness theorems , you are using reason to think about Godel's theorem as an example of anti-logic or something. Realizing limits of logic is logical and reasonable so reason is the foundation of everything.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There definitely is such a thing as post-rational. You just haven't gotten there yet.
</p>

<p>
	What you are saying is still within the Aristotelian linear logical paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The point of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is that it cannot be understood via logic. It is only understandable via intuition. You think you are using logic when really you are using intuition. You cannot encapsulate Truth mechanically. Or in other words: all logic relies on intuition.
</p>

<p>
	But even that aside, there is something even deeper than Godel's theorems. Yes, Godel's work is still largely within the rationalist paradigm, however, that's just the departure point.
</p>

<p>
	The point of post-rationalism is that you stop using reason entirely, you stop arguing, you stop proving, you stop communicating, you stop thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Reason is not the foundation of anything. Reason is just word-games. The foundations of reality have nothing to do with human reason.

			Reason or Logic does not imply materialism or Scientism, of course science can't answer everything and matter may not exist, but you need Logic to understand all of this.  
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, you don't need logic to understand all this.
</p>

<p>
	And also, post-rational doesn't mean you stop using logic forever. It means you are capable of transcending logic when appropriate. Post-rational people are not irrational, nor do they reject all rationality. They are just able to go beyond it and they are aware of its limits.

<title>Are You Saying Reality is Subjective or Objective Idealism?</title>

<p>
	Subjective vs objective is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is nondual.
</p>

<p>
	Anything you could say about nonduality would be false, as all thought and speech is based on dualistic divisions like subjective vs objective, real vs unreal, existence vs non-existence, big vs small, matter vs mind, dual vs nondual, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Truth escapes all attempts to encapulate it.

<p>
	Love is being itself. Like the physical building blocks of reality.
</p>

<p>
	But this cannot be seen while through the cloud of smog of the ego.
</p>

<p>
	You have to die to see that all is love. Ego is incapable of such love. Only with death does it come.

</p>

<p>
	Mystical experiences are nice, but you need to go deeper, beyond experience to Truth itself, which is not an experience or a state.
</p>

<p>
	There are many depths to how awakened you can be. So always keep boring deeper and deeper.
</p>

<p>
	For an awakening to stick, the illusion of self needs to be thoroughly decontructed. It's very common to keep falling back into the illusion because you still haven't fully deconstructed it.

<p>
	There are a lot of great cutting-edge physics and science lectures available on Youtube these days, so I thought it would be nice if we started to pool the best ones.
</p>

<p>
	Please think twice before posting a science video here. We want really good videos which demonstrate high Yellow/Turquoise holistic science. Find videos which are really big picture or have some larger metaphysical, epistemic, or spiritual implications. I'm thinking of stuff akin to the work of visionary scientists like Einstein, Niels Bohr, David Bohm, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff that is post-materialist, post-rationalist. Stuff that's outside the box and really captures the imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Of course we shouldn't expect these scientists to really fathom nonduality. Most of them will still be materialists and still stuck in their models. But still, they will often say interesting tidbits which dovetail with nonduality.
</p>

<title>Are humans philosophical zombies?</title>

<p>
	Don't take Western philosophy too seriously. All of Western philosophy is basically delusion.
</p>

<p>
	There is not such thing as no consciousness. Only consciousness exists.
</p>

<p>
	If there were zombies, they would be made out of consciousness.
