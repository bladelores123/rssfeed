	The ego hates equality when it is on the benefiting end of an inequality.
</p>

<p>
	Any move towards equality will be perceived as unfair by the ego who stood to benefit from the inequality.

<p>
	That is selfishness 101.

<p>
	If you take away a slaveowner's slaves, from his POV, he's losing something. And that's perceived as unfair.

			Leo, just because your past includes getting away from the image of the nerd and the 4chan troll, doesnt mean you have to constantly demonize them and act as like they are just pathetic man-children who cant get their act together. There is a real reason more and more men feel disenfranchised and completely helpless. Many of them were never given any help and even told the opposite of what is true about girls. Many of them did not grow up with a father and therefore suffer under completely one-sided, overly sensitive and overly nurturing parenting. They were given no proper tools whatsoever to be a successful man, I dont blame them for feeling anger. They have no connections to society whatsoever, thats why they dont care to shoot it up.

<p>
	This is a legit problem. But it has little to do with feminism.

	You could blame video games. Video games certainly have a lot more to do with it than feminism. Why don't you target video games instead?

<p>
	Traditional roles were not erased by feminists. Those traditional roles were never sustainable to begin with because they were built upon collective mental fictions and norms. Those norms had to break down with rise of various technological advancements.

	You also underestimate how stiffing and limiting those roles were. People got sick of fitting into such narrow and artificial roles.

<p>
	If you really care about unity, then stop parroting this ideology and go read some books on feminism with an open mind.
</p>

<p>
	You need to step outside your male perspective and look at society from the POV of women. Which is precisely what you won't want to do. And this is what's creating your perceived division. If you would see the world from the POV of women, your projection of division would cease and unity would result. You would also become happier and you'd be more successful with relating to women.

	Remember, women in America could not have a line of credit from the bank until the 1970's. Just think about that!

<p>
	Stage Blue can be extremely genuine in its devotion. That isn't the problem. The problem is that they cannot recognize that their devotional path is just one out of many others and not the best. This leads to a monomaniacal devotion which never doubts itself, where the ends justify any wicked means.
</p>

<p>
	You are not yet properly understanding stage Blue. Study up on it.

When we talk about Absolute Love we are not talking about what you'd normally think. This existential Love is a much deeper notion than just human feelings, emotions, moods, personal likes, or some positive orientation towards certain objects.
</p>

<p>
	Love is the very physical substrate of reality. So think of it this way: reality is not made out of atoms or matter, reality is made out of Love. Once you understand that, you can see how even someone like Hitler is made out of pure Love. It's not that I personally have to love Hitler. It's that Hitler is literally carved out of Love. Love is his physics, we might say. The atoms don't care if Hitler kills people or is nice to people. Likewise, existential Love doesn't care if Hitler is a mass murder.
</p>

<p>
	In this sense, hate is literally made out of Love. In the same way that a scientist would tell you that hate is made out of atoms.
</p>

<p>
	Existential Love can behave in different ways: it can smile, it can laugh, it can be nice, it can say sweet words, it can kiss you on the head, or it can murder you and boil your skull for dinner.
</p>

<p>
	You may object to the murdering or boiling, but Love is so strong it doesn't care about your human squeamishness and aversions.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When you recommend psycho-analysis to supplement this work, that's exactly why I recommend psychedelics. Just like psycho-analysis the psychedelic's function is not primary to enlighten you but to clear out lesser blockages, shadow issues, and to show you what is getting in way of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	The benefit of psychedelics is that it's faster, cheaper, more direct than months of talk therapy, and gives awakenings as well. But of course for those who cannot access psychedelics, I can see the value of psycho-analysis.
</p>

<p>
	I've not done formal psycho-analysis but I'd guess 3-12 months of psycho-analysis = 1-3 psychedelic trips. The cost savings would also be very significant.
</p>

<p>
	I've noticed that most people who take psychedelics don't have very deep awakenings on them because first the psychedelic must clear out psychological baggage (AKA, psychoanalysis). The existential insights require a purified mind and heart. The deep existential insights tend to come in later trips, after the mind has been purified a bit of its human baggage.
</p>

<p>
	Just a useful insight I thought I'd share with you guys.
</p>

<p>
	The oversight I made in the past is that I tended to think of the psychedelic purely as a gateway to nondual states. But that's only half of their function. The other half is the psycho-analytic resolution of psychological baggage.
</p>

	I found that when you start this journey it tends to be quite neurotic and not very effective. But at the same time, you can only start where you're at, so neurotic practice is better than no practice at all.
</p>

<p>
	You problems could be answered with a couple of deep psychedelic trips, where you would face the real existential root of your dysfunctions and let them go. Then you could proceed with a more organic spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	The value of the psychedelic is not so much in that it enlightens you, but that it clearly shows you what is preventing you from awakening, what is holding you back. Otherwise you could waste years chasing your tail in circles.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest challenges of the spiritual path is what we get in our own way. We all have unique ways of getting in our own way. Psychedelics help you understand your unique ways of getting in your own way so you can stop doing it. It tends to not be enough to just intellectually know how you get in your own way. You need a deep mystical experience of it to learn the lesson and change your ways.
</p>

<p>
	Intellectual efforting here just tends to be very slow and needlessly ineffective compared to a few psychedelic trips which will just bombard you with all the answers in a way that no book, therapist, or guru could.
</p>

<p>
	Really, once you learn how to properly use psychedelics, you will never need a teacher or book. The most powerful answers are in your trips. Everything else is weak sauce that literally wastes years of time and thousands of dollars in money.
</p>

<p>
	Love as an absolute has no opposite. In the same way that existence has no opposite. Non-existence is just an existent idea. Hate is a relative aspect of absolute Love.

		<p>
			After a little research I found that although they are a linear progression his 'advanced courses' vary greatly. SG mentions several times that the first of his 3 advanced courses are for people who want to enhance their wellbeing (Bhava Spandana). Only the last course (Samyama) is meant for a seeker aka the real deal.
		</p>

			Did the interviewee complete Samyama? Or only some of the earlier advanced courses?

<p>
	I don't remember what he completed.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sure Sadhguru has some very advanced students who are deeply enlightened. But that's probably pretty rare given how mainstream Isha has become. Most people doing it are dabblers who don't even know what enlightenment means. They are doing it for personal health benefits or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	Overall I don't have any problem with Sadhguru's teachings. I'm just not the type who will ever follow a single guru.

			I believe that the main problem of the Israeli left is blaming Netanyahu for destroying the country, and not taking any responsibility. So many Israelis are so focused on him, and no one is really looking for a real deep solution for both sides.
		</p>

		<p>
			Leo, it is very much like you said in your conciseness politics mini-series. Each side (Israeli right and left) is self-biased and no one goes within to find whats really needs to be done. The Israeli left is so stuck on a victim position, it might be the reason the country is so stuck in deeply-blue orange state.        But at the same time, the country is only 70 years old and most of the right wingers came to here in the 50s from eastern states while they were really into red-blue position - So I believe we’re really progressing into more and more green. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't know much about the Israeli left, so I can't speak to those internal politics. I'm more looking at Israel as an outsider and criticizing it from an outsider's perspective. From an outsider's international perspective is seems that Israel's conservative party has hijacked the country and behaves unfairly towards Palestinians by trying to make a two state solution impossible with sneaky settles. I see this is a right-wing collective egotism which lack empathy for Palestinians.
</p>

<p>
	So my only point is that just devilry should be called out and not encouraged (the way the American right-wing likes to do).

<p>
	It's not a matter of belief. You are God, you are One, and you are all things. It's not that I'm talking to myself, it's that you're talking to yourself. If it seem like you're talking to me that's because you've adopted the belief in separate human beings.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness is a radical thing.

	I hear what you're saying. But I just wonder, when the Nazi's were coming to power in the 30's, what would you have proposed?
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that when you negotiate with fundamentalists they take and take and take and give nothing in return.
</p>

<p>
	I'm curious how you would negotiate with conservatives in America. Obama tried to appease them and it didn't work. They still smeared him as a socialist and undermined him at every turn.
</p>

<p>
	How would you deal with Trump and his evangelical base? You think they are going to negotiate with you and give any ground to stage Green? Would you advocate not to put pressure on the migrant concentration camps at the US border & on Trump?
</p>

<p>
	Vocal outrage can be an effective tool for social evolution as most people are complacent and unaware of what's really happening in society. The outrage can make people aware of the issue.
</p>

<p>
	I have read Elza Maalouf's book.
</p>

<p>
	I am really curious how you negotiate with people who precisely do not want rise above their worldview? Sometimes I feel like Integral Theory is too naive and idealistic about how ruthless politics can be.
</p>

<p>
	What do you consider the solution to Trump? Is it better to elect a centrist Democrat or a far left one like Bernie Sanders who will put pressure on the corporate domination of US politics and drive hard towards Green?
</p>

<p>
	I feel like Obama's approach towards the conservatives was somewhat stage Yellow, yet it did not work out so well because the conservatives just took advantage of of his moderation and willingness to compromise.
</p>

<p>
	When one side is acting like a devil, what do you do according to Spiral Dynamics? Because the devil is certainly clever enough to take advantage of a moderate Spiral Dynamics approach.

	There is no such line because everything is relative.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, 150 years ago millions of people believed they had the right to own slaves.
</p>

<p>
	That's relativity.
</p>

<p>
	What's even crazier is that since you are all beings, you were one of them! So your judgment of slaveowners is itself self-bias! How do we get everyone in the world to acknowledge that he/she owned slaves at one point?
</p>

<p>
	LOL, good luck with that one.

<p>
	Our Statue of Liberty says, "Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free..." yet we hold asylum seekers in concentration camps right this minute.
</p>

<p>
	Zionism may have good intentions, but the practical result of such an ideology results in putting Jews first, above all others. Which is problematic.
</p>

<p>
	I know there are many Jews who don't support the right-wing Israeli government. Good for them. Be more vocal.

<p>
	The body is a hallucination, just like everything else.
</p>

<p>
	There is no fundamental difference between your body and your thoughts -- if you are conscious enough.
</p>

<p>
	The body is actually being willed into existence by Universal Mind. God's Will made manifest creates every cell in your body.
</p>

<p>
	The body is made out of Infinite Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But none of this will make a lick of sense unless you're in a nondual state of consciousness. So go do some psychedelics or Kriya yoga or whatever.

<p>
	Of course the leadership can change, but Israeli politics has been heavily dominated by Zionists for a long time, just as right now American politics is heavily dominated by nationalists.
</p>

<p>
	It's like blaming America for the Iraq War even though many Americans were against it. But as a national we deserve to be blamed for allowing such things to happen in our name.

Rich people all know each other. All you gotta do is convert one of them and then they will do the work of converting the rest. Similar to how Christianity took over the Roman Empire with the conversion of Emperor Constantine.

It will be less than you think.
</p>

<p>
	Farmers use fertilizer and crop rotation for a reason.
</p>

<p>
	You can't just keep growing plants on a plot of land forever. If only life was so easy.

<p>
	There's some groupthink here, but no it cannot get out of hand because I control it and I have no interest in using it for such purposes. There's not really an organization here, just people posting random stuff.
</p>

<p>
	"The Family" has a deliberate mission to spread their ideology. They are basically doing covert missionary work at a geopolitical level.
</p>

<p>
	Funny enough, I had actually considered a similar plan. What if we took the world's top 500 richest and most powerful people and took them through a full course of 5-MeO-DMT? Giving them legit awakenings. That could transform the entire world overnight. But it could also lead to a lot of devilry so I'm not foolish enough to try that. It's not a good idea to force spirituality on people.

Really, to me, i am an angel, sometimes i try to ask myself, where am i deluding myself, where am i being evil, but no concrete answers come and everything seems hollow. But when i ask about others, tons of answer comes about other's self bias, evilness and on and on.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that's precisely that challenge of evil. Eradicating evil is so hard because one cannot see it in oneself.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone is quick to see the self-biases of others but not oneself. And thus the Greater Jihad degrades into the Lesser Jihad.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is an important point which needs to be underscored.
</p>

<p>
	The devil does most of his work in a collective. A collective allows for the near total masking of self-bias, since if you manage to surround yourself with 1000 people who share your self-bias, you will look out at the world and it will seem like you have no self-bias because your self-biases are perfectly reflected back at you. This is why people in conformist groups do some really evil shit. The collective absolves them of responsibility. It's like becoming a minnow in a school of fish. No one minnow controls the entire school. They all just go with the flow until they drive themselves off the cliff.
</p>

<p>
	Collective spirituality is a very dangerous game. It's almost guaranteed to be co-opted by the devil.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I don't grow Actualized.org into an actual organization with staff.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can't conquer the devil through criticism. The devil is conquered through love.
</p>

<p>
	But it is important to expose the devil's machinations to the light of awareness, to bring it into public light. That's a very important function in society that we need more of.

<p>
	Yes, I've tried it.
</p>

<p>
	To me Kriya pranayama seems more potent so I do that instead.
</p>

<p>
	I get the sense that Sadhguru doesn't share his most potent techniques because his program is designed to be extremely mainstream and he doesn't want to freak out poor grannies with epic existential mindfuckery.
</p>

<p>
	To me, the most important aspect of yoga is the pranayama spinal breathing. Without that, it feels like weak sauce to me and I don't want to waste my time with weak sauce. I want something that will rival 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	When I do pranayama to me it feels powerful. So that's what I focus on most.
</p>

<p>
	But I'm no expert at yoga. I just follow my intuition.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Ridicule and mockery can be good.
</p>

<p>
	Comedy is a great weapon against stupidity, hypocrisy, and authoritarianism.
</p>

<p>
	Treating aggressively ignorant people seriously plays into their game.
</p>

<p>
	Or just systematically deconstructing their ignorance and making them look like the obvious fools they are. A fool should be made to feel embarrassed for flaunting his foolishness publicly.
</p>

<p>
	You know why women are attracted to men with a good sense of humor? Because it's an honest signal of power. In a small tribe, when someone gets too egotistical, the other males will use humor and mockery to cut his ego to pieces and make him look like a fool. Humor is actually a powerful weapon and you gotta be smart to know how to use it well.
</p>

<p>
	One thing you should not do is engage aggressive ignorance in serious debate. There can be no productive conversation with a person with an aggressively closed mind.
</p>

<p>
	Another approach that's possible is demonstration of love.
</p>

	You make some good points, but don't lose hope. Mankind and nature is more resilient than you think. A few degrees of higher temp will certainly not kill off mankind. And new technologies will allow future generations to rehabilitate the planet.

	Things might get bad for the next 100 years. But they should get much better after that.

	Remember, evolution is always moving towards higher consciousness and higher love. It will not fail. Not in the long run. There is a higher intelligence at work.

<p>
	Of course they are totally ignorant of what they are really doing. They have no idea how the devil works through them. They have no consciousness of self-survival, self-agenda, or self-bias. The ego is designed to do all of these survival manipulations automatically below the radar of one's awareness. It's only by doing a lot of the kind of work that we do here at Actualized.org that you start to see the sneaky nature of your ego.
</p>

<p>
	From an ego's POV, everything it does is for the greatest good. The ego creates justification and stories to make everything look good, truthful, and innocent. The ego is good by definition. How can that be? Because the ego said so and there was no one to question it. This is precisely self-bias in action. The person is not aware of his self-bias, and neither is an organization like this Family. They truly believe they are doing God's work and that if everyone on Earth became a follower of Jesus the Earth would be saved. This looks plausible from their POV because they don't care about the POVs of other people nor do they care about religious freedoms of others. "Jesus + nothing".
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it works just like with Hitler. Hitler thought he was going the greatest good for his people.
</p>

<p>
	The whole tragedy of stage Blue is that it simply cannot see outside its own paradigm. It's absolutely paradigm locked and it's in denial about it.
</p>

<p>
	But don't forget, you do this too. It's easy to see others doing this sneaky shit and get outraged, but your own mind does this sort of stuff every day in ways you don't yet realize. After all, don't you believe you're a good person? Why is that?
</p>

<p>
	If everyone is such a good person why is there so much cruelty in the world?
</p>

<p>
	There is actually not such thing as conscious evil. All evil is unconscious, even though it may be very strategic like in this documentary. Even the leader does not really understand what he is doing. He has fooled himself into thinking he's spreading the will of God. But actually he's spreading his ego.
</p>

<p>
	This documentary is a textbook example of "spiritual ego". That's how bad it can get. Which is why it's so important for us to study such things in detail. Lest we become like that ourselves.
</p>

Everyone needs to see this documentary. Those sneaky fucks.
</p>

<p>
	The cleverness of devilry always amazes me. It's like God is an infinitely sneaky fox. Always finding new ways to outfox himself.
</p>

<p>
	The best kind of devilry cloaks itself in the name of God and goodness. It's so audaciously selfish that it manages to go full-circle and fly under the radar. Until it gets exposed by the light of awareness.
</p>

<p>
	The reason stage Blue can be so dangerous is because it has no doubt whatsoever that whatever its doing is God's will and for the good of all. But in reality it's a Trojan horse for the ego's survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	"Jesus + Nothing" of course means that if you practice any spirituality other than theirs, you'll be made nothing.

<p>
	From what little I know there's a lot of stage Purple tribal and clan warfare going on there due to the power vacuum.
</p>

<p>
	Someone will have to unify all those tribes under one national banner and get them to stop fighting. But of course they will fight to resist such unification.

<p>
	Of course I agree that not masturbating should be more powerful. But also, don't torture yourself too much.

<p>
	The backslide is never going to take you back to where you began. It's not like you can backslide to 1st grade arithmetic. You forgot a lot of math from high school, but you ain't back to grade 1. There is always some stuff you can't forgrt even if you wanted to. And it's always easier to relearn what you forgot than learning it the first time.
</p>

<p>
	The first time is the hardest.

<p>
	Haha, this is just a basic physics question.
</p>

<p>
	The Earth shrinks every time you send objects into outer space. If you send a trillion pounds of books to outer space, the mass of the Earth will decrease by a trillion pounds. Eventually the Earth would become so small that it could no longer hold a tree or a rocket. But you'd be dead long before that happened.
</p>

<p>
	Plants leech matter from the Earth. They don't get it out of thin air.

<p>
	Of course Islam, like any religion, is all over the Spiral. But also highly centered around Blue. You'd have to look at it on a local regional level if you are serious about understanding it.
</p>

<p>
	Sam Harris does not understand this. He tends to lump all of Islam together as bad and barbaric. He conflates the content of Islam with various stages of development.

<p>
	My ex-girlfriend was from HK. HK people consider themselves very different from mainland Chinese. HK is basically like its own country with a unique culture. Or at least it was.
</p>

<p>
	HK culture is much more Western due to a century of British rule. And the Hong Kongers like it that way.

<p>
	UBI is actually a quasi-libertarian thing. Many technocrats and libertarian types propose the UBI as a replacement for all the welfare systems. Which is very problematic.
</p>

<p>
	There are good and there are bad ways to do UBI. If UBI is proposed as a replacement for all social benefit programs, that's very problematic.

<p>
	That's the trick, libertarians don't really think much about how others struggle. They assume that everyone in the world is as comfy and privileged as them.
</p>

<p>
	When you live in a peaceful white suburban neighborhood with nice streets, clean water, good grocery stores, in the wealthiest country on the planet, life seems easy and all you could ask for is more personal freedom. The libertarian does not consider what life is like for a disabled single mother working two minimum wage jobs because her parents were drug addicts and sexually molested her and didn't have enough money to send her to private school and university. Such cases are not part of the libertarian reality.

<p>
	In practice, when anarchy and chaos run amok what's required is a strong dictator who will rule with an iron fist to get everyone to shut up and get in line and stop being devils.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically to achieve this the dictator must himself be the biggest devil to rule them all.
</p>

<p>
	Qaddafi was such a guy.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that such political problems are so complex and tricky that there often aren't pleasant solutions.
</p>

<p>
	This makes you appreciate the functional role that dictators play. They are not merely evil bad guys. They are necessary at a certain stage of development.

<p>
	Formlessness is not separate from form or human experience.
</p>

<p>
	You need to go further and realize that form and formlessness are one.

<p>
	This. Now. Here. Is. It.

<p>
	It is all possible states and non-states alike. But from certain states it is easier to "see".

<p>
	This is just a belief. No different than when a Christian believes that the Earth is 5000 years old.

<p>
	Question all your assumptions. Where did you get this belief about brains and sense organs and biological creatures? Notice that all of it is hearsay from other people. You do not find any of this in direct experience.

	What more do you want? Do those things more rigorously rather that looking for new stuff to do.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you went to the best buffet in town, surrounded by food, and you log onto a food forum and ask the people there, "Guys, I'm at this buffet, but tell me how to increase my chances of finding more food."
</p>

<p>
	This work is not about more flashy stuff, it's about going deeper with the basics.

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is not a quality, it is all qualities and their negation simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity & God are not concepts. Of course they are concepts, but those concepts point to something prior to concept. In the same way that Australia is a concept BUT there is also the actual land which the word "Australia" points to.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, concepts themselves are part of Infinity, otherwise they could to occur.

<p>
	Because you aren't aware that you are me.
</p>

<p>
	You are implicitly assuming that there is a you and a me (these two beings). But there isn't. And you don't understand that yet. You acknowledge the possibility that you and I are one, but you are only doing this at the level of concept. You aren't doing it actually. If you did it actually you would experience a death of yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment at the level of concept is not enlightenment, it is theory. You must go from theory to actuality.
</p>

<p>
	Come to a point where there is actually no difference between me and you. Not in theory, but ACTUALLY!
</p>

<p>
	This requires a change in your state of consciousness. You cannot do it through thinking.

<p>
	I wouldn't think of kundalini complications as being dark. It's just various sorts of energetic unlocking & processing.
</p>

<p>
	An energetic block doesn't have to be dark to be uncomfortable, frustrating, or troubling.
</p>

<p>
	So you can practice being loving, but an energetic upheaval can still get ya.

	Then again, for some people there might be a dark aspect to kundalini. There's a lot of variety to how these things can unfold. Some people report experiencing demons and other weird stuff. Personally that's foreign to my experiences but I think it's possible for some.
</p>

<p>
	I've never had a demonic experience in 70+ trips. I'm not sure what causes it. I guess demons don't like me <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />

<p>
	This is false. You can have direct experience of and genuine insight into the nature of death, afterlife, and pre-life.
</p>

<p>
	Of course people concoct all sorts of theories, but there are also some people who actually know through direct experience and mystical insight.

	Cancer of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that people who hold these ideologies have almost no historical understanding of how government works, nor do they have any understanding of human psychology.
</p>

<p>
	It's simply ignorance, naivete, and arrogance rolled into one.
</p>

<p>
	You'll notice that no country in the history of the Earth has ever been libertarian or anarchist. Because it doesn't work to meet the needs of the people, so it would never be tolerated. You'd have to be a fool to even begin implementing it because you would quickly be kicked out or killed.
</p>

<p>
	Try to imagine a libertarian or anarchist going to Russia or China and promoting their agenda. LOL

<p>
	Your mistake is sitting there thinking about all this with your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Instead, you must do the practices.
</p>

<p>
	All your rationalizing is just a waste of time. You will never figure it out that way.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get somewhere, go do psychedelics, or Kriya yoga, or mindfulness meditation. Do it seriously and rigorously, like it's the most important pursuit in your life, more important than money, sex, entertainment, or comfort.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot understand the things I teach without doing serious practices. It's just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	Do, or do not. Speculation and theorizing will get you nowhere.
</p>

<p>
	Common sense should tell you that there must be a heavy, heavy cost to awakening, otherwise everyone would be awake.

<p>
	Self/other is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	You are imagining all beings, including yourself. Living beings have no reality whatsoever. This includes you.
</p>

<p>
	When this is realized, you will be totally alone in the universe. No one can help you, no one can tell you whether you've gone insane. No one can comfort you. Other than yourself.
</p>

<p>
	At this point the notion of reality entirely collapses. You are no long able to distinguish what is real or unreal because there is no difference. Your entire life collapses into oblivion and you find yourself dead yet still somehow conscious.

	I stand corrected in that Rumi did not found Sufism itself but he founded the Mevlevi order and the famous whirling dervishes meditation dance:

	Rumi did a lot to popularize Sufism.

<p>
	It's a powerful kundalini activator for some people. The energy it activates can get stuck in various ways and lead to all sorts of spiritual emergencies. Not to mention that any kind of technique which rapidly builds up mindfulness and elevates consciousness can cause people to freak out. The ego-mind tends to resist such efforts in many different kinds of sneaky ways. It can trigger sleepless, anxiety, anger, restlessness, tension, cravings, visions, hallucinations, paranormal phenomena, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You should read up on the dangers of activating kundalini before you start yoga. I have some books on my book list about it. You don't want to be caught unawares.
</p>

<p>
	Basically all the stuff I talked about in my The Dark Side Of Meditation video, but even worse.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear, it's not guaranteed that bad stuff will happen. It's just a possibility.
</p>

<p>
	It also depends on how deep you go with it. If it takes you all the way to enlightenment you can certainly expect all the freakiness that comes with awakening, including the Dark Night of The Soul. Awakening is not all rainbows and daffodils. Some egos have serious freak outs.

<p>
	Rumi was a one in a billion enlightened master. And he started his own sect: Sufism, which most mainstream Muslims reject.
