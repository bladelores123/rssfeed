	That's what good game looks like. It doesn't just charm women, it charms all humans.
</p>

<p>
	It feels totally effortless and natural. There is nothing creepy or scripted about it. It's like improvisational art.

	That cannot possibly happen because all survival is relative.
</p>

<p>
	You're not appreciating the depth of this problem.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot EVER be such as thing as perfect goodness within the relative domain of form because perfect Goodness is only available to Infinite Consciousness, which is formless.
</p>

<p>
	If an organism could simply be programmed to act good, God would have already done that. God made organisms selfish precisely because it was necessary for their survival.

<p>
	Dude, chill out. Using the n-word will get you banned here.
</p>

<p>
	You seem to be way overcompensating for something.
</p>

<p>
	Racist is a valid concept -- within certain relativistic limits -- and serves a function in stopping racism -- which is a real phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the label racist can be overused. But splitting hairs over the concept of racism just strikes me as gratuitous.
</p>

<p>
	There are plenty of legit racists in the world, and calling them out on it is fair.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Bingo! That's it. It's as simple as that.
</p>

<p>
	It's even reflected in your username.
</p>

<p>
	You will have to do deep inner work to heal, forgive, and release that trauma. Then you will be able to be more intimate with men.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a problem of lack of sexual skill. It's an inner game problem due to your molestation.
</p>

<p>
	Your best bet is working with a spiritual healer/coach to release your trauma, rather than watching sex technique videos.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is not about mechanical technique. It's about your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you can't cum is because you were molested and now you're not able to fully surrender to the man. You probably have a deep fear of intimacy and vulnerability because you had to put up emotional armor to protect yourself against the hurt and shame of being molested by a family member.

			I read the following description of sexual frustration by a guy with a very high sex drive on reddit. I assumed that it was similar for you. I always thought that a guy sex drive could be evaluated by the number of time he can cum in a day. I guess it's more nuanced than that.

			"Never-ending feeling of being horny. Talking from when I wake up, to when I go to bed, with the most intense times being right after I wake up and again before I fall asleep (being in a bed maybe?). It's a constant nagging sensation that just will not go away. Anything will make me horny. A look from a pretty girl, a bit of skin, really anything involving a nice-looking girl and I'm rock hard. It's subsided a bit as I move into my later-20s, but when I was younger I would get hard all the time over virtually nothing. A look, a laugh, a bra strap. Anything. It's a never-ending sensation of biological deprivation, a thirst you can't quench. And it can fuck with your head after a while.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I've never had a constant insatiable horniness like this guy is describing.
</p>

<p>
	I'm regularly horny, but I can also please myself and get on with work or whatever. If I want to, I can focus on work for a week at a time and forget all about sex.
</p>

<p>
	I get most horny during solo meditation retreats.

<p>
	Yes, if you push him on it, as a philosophical level he will acknowledge relativity. But then he will go back to calling half the country fascist.
</p>

<p>
	It's an interesting dynamic.
</p>

<p>
	Relativity is an extremely deep topic. It can be realized at mild levels or at extremely deep levels, or anything in between. Mostly people's understanding and appreciation of relativity is skin deep and purely theoretical.

			Youre right, but in a sense, the problem still remains and was not solved.  The same conflict exists just in a different form.  We've done everything to continually escalate with Iran.  We've committed actual acts of war against them even assassinating their lead general as he waged a war against ISIS in Iraq.  The show continues on even today top officials still constantly push regime change in Iran.  And it all of this all  started back from the coup in 1953.

<p>
	Of course right-wing US policy towards Iran has been disastrous.

<p>
	Being Purple and Red does not mean one has to carry an AK-47 or want to kill Americans.
</p>

<p>
	Most Purple and Red people are relatively peaceful and decent. They are just very tribal, fundamentalist religious, and uneducated.

	This is not the real Middle East. This is the rich kids from the Middle East. The cream of the crop. You gotta go to the rural parts of the Middle East to really see the depth of the problem. You gotta go to the Mississippi of the Middle East. It won't be Blue/Orange.

<p>
	Most guys are really turned on my femininity. So anything you can do to amp up your expression of femininity will drive them nuts. Just by acting up your femininity in bed this will make the sex 10x hotter. Acting up femininity is stuff like sweet talk, gentleness, moaning, squirming, going into heat, being submissive, etc.

	You just need to find the right guy and get turned on in the right ways.

<p>
	You can have a deep vaginal orgasm without even any physical touch.

<p>
	Russell Brand isn't a skill. It's his natural disposition. He's off-the-charts extroverted and charismatic. An introverted guy is never going to be able match that.

<p>
	Sam has a lot of experience and wisdom when it comes to politics.
</p>

<p>
	What I admire about him is his no-nonsense groundedness. If you ignore the fun half of the show, then you can clearly see Sam's expertise and wisdom. But people like to skip the serious first half of the show to get to the fun half -- where, yeah -- he makes a lot of fun of people. It's fun but shallow. But it draws people in to the serious half.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with overly young pundits is that they simply lack the maturity and experience and wisdom. People in their 20's and 30's are simply too immature to do solid, grounded political analysis. They are still too utopian.
</p>

<p>
	Guys like Vaush, Kyle, etc. are still too young, too edgy, too immature, etc. They need to ripen into their 40's and 50's to really get good I think.
</p>

			The US played a major role in the long term destabilization of the region.  The US overthrew a democratically elected leader in Iran during the 1953 Iranian coup and installed an American friendly dictator who then signed a large fraction of Iranian oil fields over the Americans.  That planted the beginnings of the now well known hatred west, which festered for 25 years until it lead to civil war where the American installed Shah was overthrown by a theocratic regime. It's interesting because the country was generally fairly prosperous and in fact was largely being westernized in the 20 years after the 1953 Coup.  In this case, a CIA coup, worked to create a sort of Islamic conservative backlash which led to the Iranian Revolution 25 years later.

</p>

<p>
	But, I still think that Iran would have had a conservative backlash regardless. There is no way that Iran would have been able to sustain some thriving liberal socialist democracy. It's not developed enough for that. There is still way too much religious fundamentalism there, and the US is the not the cause of that.
</p>

<p>
	The US is merely exploiting such things for its own gain. Like a hyena picking at a crippled animal. The hyena did not take down the animal. The animal broke its own leg. Of course this does not excuse the US's exploitative behavior.
</p>

<p>
	And if the US has not taken out Saddam, he and Iran would still be at each others throats.
</p>

<p>
	It's really hard to say whether taking out Saddam was a net positive or negative in the very long run. In the short run it was bad.
</p>

<p>
	The limit of your morality is set by the limit of your consciousness, selflessness, and capacity to love.
</p>

<p>
	The bottleneck is not morality. It's consciousness, selflessness, and love.

			The problem with this kind of categorization is that it is very black and white. It assumes that the human psyche is not a paradox of two opposing forces but either or.

<p>
	This is an important point. I agree with this.
</p>

<p>
	The human psyche is far too complex to simply fall into 4 categories like: "sociopath", "psychopath", "narcissist", and "normie". It's a complex blend of thousands of variables which no psychologist fully understands.
</p>

<p>
	Yet still, some people are just straight up flaming narcissists.

<p>
	It's important, but the cost of Arabs selling so much oil is that Americans will interfere with their affairs. You can't have one without the other.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not proper to say, "Well, if only the West didn't interfere with the Arabs they would be thriving democracies." No they wouldn't. They would be ruthless monarchs living in the middle ages. The West has accelerated Middle Eastern development despite the obvious exploitation. The West has also accelerated the East's development despite the obvious exploitation.

	"Steal like an artist."

<p>

<p>
	Intimation is natural. It's how humans learn. The secret is to steal like an artist. By which is meant: intimate from dozens and even hundreds of obscure sources until you develop a style of your own.
</p>

<p>
	Intimation is only bad when you imitate the most obvious mainstream stuff. This is just creative laziness.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I imitate self-help professionals, but I will never imitate Tony Robbins or Eckhart Tolle, because they are too obvious. I imitate people no one knows about. And I imitate dozens of them. This way my creative gene pool is diverse rather than inbred.

<title>Relativity always implied</title>

<p>
	Since most people are absolutists and don't understand or appreciate relativity, they will interpret your language as absolutist.
</p>

<p>
	When most people say, "Fascists are stupid or evil" they don't mean it relativistically, they mean it absolutely. Which is a big problem.
</p>

<p>
	I do the same thing as you. I always implicitly mean everything I say is relativistic, but because that's too long-winded to explain every time, I often make statements which sound absolutist and which people misunderstand as me being absolutist.
</p>

<p>
	So, for example, when I say libertarians are stupid, I of course mean it relativistically. But people think I mean it absolutely.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to avoid this problem because you'd have to constantly qualify everything you say and an absolutist wouldn't appreciate your qualifications anyway because they reject relativity to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to this is to teach relativity early in and all throughout school. Our culture itself does not understand relativity yet.
</p>

	It can't fundamentally be blamed on the US.
</p>

<p>
	Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, etc would all still be Purple/Red countries even if the US stayed out of their affairs entirely.

<p>
	If the US didn't invade Iraq, Saddam and his psychopathic sons would still be in power.

			Leo's latest video about Why something rather than nothing got my mind all twisted up. 
		</p>

		<p>
			There is no distinction between nothing and something and there are no boundaries, everything is in perfect symmetry. Everything in infinite. Then why is the universe always describe as infinite love? Why not infinite hate? Is there no distinction between love and hate? I guess not since everything is nothing, you, me, god, universe, love, are all the same...nothing. But why then does no one talk about the universe as infinite hate? If everything is truly infinite and symmetrical, it should include everything right? Why then is god/the universe described as being infinite love? why not infinite hate too? why not infinite comedy? Or is that just it, there is no distinction or boundary between anything? everything is just nothing?
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm confused but this topic is super interesting to think about reality in this way. Loved the video.

<p>
	Love is an Absolute. Yet you are thinking of it dualistically, as though it has an opposite.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Love is simply the realization that there is literally no difference between any two things. When this is realized, Love becomes infinite and incorporates all possible opposites and dualities, leaving perfect Oneness.
</p>

<p>
	This Oneness is Love. If you think about what Love actually means, it means an acceptance and embrace of a thing. So what would happen if you accepted, embraced, and fell in love with everything in the universe to equal degree, without any bias whatsoever? You'd get Absolute Love, or Oneness.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Love is so all-embracing that is embraces hate and love equally. Because it literally is incapable of distinguishing them. When you can't distinguish hate vs love or good vs evil, the result is not neutrality, the result is Absolute Love or Absolute Good. Love conquers hate and evil by fully embracing it and realizing it to be a sub-set of Love, and therefore identical to Love itself.
</p>

<p>
	God literally cannot see bad or evil. So for God these things do not exist.
</p>

	Libertarians will deny that a dictator has anything to do with libertarianism. They will just claim: "We oppose all involuntary use of force."
</p>

<p>
	But of course, when a power vacuum is created by dismantling the state, a dictator is exactly what you'll get.
</p>

<p>
	A dictator technically is not libertarian, it's authoritarian. But this just proves the point that a libertarian state cannot exist. It will quickly turn into a monopoly of force.

<p>
	The difference is that 99.9% of people think theft should be illegal, while less than 30% think abortion should be.
</p>

<p>
	Society can survive just fine with abortion being legal. Society cannot survive with theft being legal.

			banning abortion would clearly reduce the number of abortions, as opposed to making it happen illegally, because then less women would be in the position where they need to do it as they would know it's illegal (or has some kind of punishment attached to it - a punishment to HELP prevent having to do an abortion).

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	By this logic no law would ever get broken.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is that banning abortion has been tried and women still do it when it is illegal. Because most people think it should be legal.
</p>

<p>
	Overwhelming majority of people think it should be legal, so in a democracy abortion will be legal. You hold a minority opinion on this, and as people evolve out of Blue to Orange, Green, and Yellow they become more tolerant of abortion, not less, so you're on the losing side of history.

<title>Fear of Intimacy &amp; Premature Ejaculation?</title>

<p>
	Have you tried deepening intimacy without sex? How do you react to that? Any resistance?
</p>

<p>
	For example, with your gf, you could try being sexually intimate with her without taking your pants off. Pleasure her and go deep with the intimacy, but don't let her touch you.
</p>

<p>
	Get creative with it. There is so much cool stuff you can do to build intimacy without sticking your dick in her.
</p>

	I'd like to make a thread that shares and explores exotic cultures around the world, in the spirit of raising our openmindedness to and appreciation of the rich cultural diversity beyond standard vanilla Western culture. There are many great examples to be shared.

<p>
	Stuff like this:

<p>
	Solid Blue of course, but I'm actually pleasantly surprised at his accommodating attitude towards atheists. He doesn't treat them as devils, like some deep Blue folks might. He is surprisingly tolerant of them. I guess because the Soviet Union created so many atheists that his Blue worldview has to accommodate that as part of its survival function.

			China has done this type of human gene editing on twin girls and it was super controversial in the scientific community. Yet they are continuing on as we speak. They are likely editing to produce the fittest beings, according to their standards of “fit”. It’s pretty straightforward for single gene traits, yet it gets much more complicated for multi gene traits like intelligence.

<p>
	Being = non-symbolic state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It's not strictly a prerequisite but it sure helps.
</p>

<p>
	With a psychedelic you can be conscious of Nothingness while also thinking and using the mind. But sober, it helps to silence the mind in order the realize Nothingness. Although later you will realize that mind itself is Nothingness, and so having thoughts is not really any different than Being or Nothingness. But this is an advanced stage one has to reach through lots of awakenings.

<p>
	Well, where else do you find the past but always in your present imagination??
</p>

<p>
	Take a close look at what "past" really is.
</p>

<p>
	If we wiped your memory, isn't it obvious that you would cease to have a past? It wouldn't merely be that you could not longer remember your past. No! Your past would literally not exist. Because your past is created now. If you stop creating it, it will stop existing. Much like when you close your eyes the room ceases to exist.

	Not a fan of Jimmy Dore, but this is a great interview and Rick Doblin is awesome.
</p>

<p>
	Good for Jimmy.
</p>

<p>
	Rick Doblin is a great example of how you take hippie ideas and make them practical in the real world. A pragmatic stage Green hippie.
</p>

<p>
	Those of you who are sad on Trump and think that society isn't progressing. Here's why you're wrong. Progress is still happening behind the scenes every year regardless of Trump's nonsense.

	That's what witchcraft has always been about. That was simply demonized by the Catholic church and other mainstream religions such that our culture still misunderstands it today.

<p>
	I've done that before. It can work so well.
</p>

<p>
	It's especially effective when the girl calls you out for being a player or if she knows anything about pickup.
</p>

<p>
	She will still get attracted even if she logically doesn't want to. Because the logic of your words make no difference to attraction. What matters is the structure, not the content of what you say.
</p>

<p>
	If you are funny and confident, you can tell her that you are going to kill her family, and she will giggle and get attracted. It's all about the delivery.

<p>
	Yes, improving your masculine frame is the key.
</p>

<p>
	One of the best ways to do it is by lots of experience with hot girls.

<p>
	Girl, there are many amazing therapists out there. Stop settling for mediocrity. You deserve to find one you're excited about working with. It doesn't have to be pulling teeth.
</p>

<p>
	I would recommend you also consider spiritual and psychic healer types. You can find them on Yelp. They will be far more conscious, developed, inuitive, and empathetic than a traditional therapist. And cheaper too.
</p>

<p>
	When I work with a high intuitive spiritual healer/coach, she tells me my problem as soon as walk through her door, before I even sit down.
</p>

<p>
	Healers who know what they are doing don't need 3 minutes to think or process. They give you instant answers.
</p>

<p>
	Go to Yelp and search: "psychic healing counseling coaching"
</p>

<p>
	How you use sex is a great honest signal of your level of consciousness and development.
</p>

<p>
	The less conscious you are, the more dysfunctional and degenerate your sex will be, and vice versa.

You get attracted to the psychopath first, and only later you start to logically think it through after you've slept with him. And by then it's too late cause you're in love with him.
</p>

<p>
	I notice you ladies on here like to analyze and do logic about what you want in a man, or what you find attractive, but all of that logic is useless in real life because your attraction is NEVER triggered by logic. The logic is something you come up with while sitting at the computer.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that.

			The reason why I'm so pessimistic is that we have some severe issues mostly relating to the long standing problem of income inequality, which is has been badly exacerbated and quickly in a short  period of time.  It actually blows my mind that in an honest analysis of our economic situation Trump couldn't have gone in a more incorrect direction.  He took off some of the post 2008 regulation, which allowed the banking system to over leverage itself.   He increased the deficit in the worst possible way, corporate tax cuts, which the corporations then used the money to enrich themselves and institutions through stock buy backs.  And he used the market as is own personal ponzi pump and dump scheme.  And much much more.

I’ve been to the club with a couple good looking folk who were athletic and built. We were all beginners and we had virtually no experience with game. Yet one female straight up walked to one of the guys and started grinding on him. They didn’t even say a word.

</p>

<p>
	And even the hottest jock cannot get laid unless he is out socializing with hot women.
</p>

<p>
	Simply going to the gym will NOT get you laid. It's actually a waste of time. All the muscles you're trying to build are to appease your own insecure ego, not to attract the girl.

<p>
	Haha! That won't work! If that worked, that's what I would tell you to do.
</p>

<p>
	What you misunderstand is that women aren't attracted by looks, they are attracted by a strong masculine persona, which you cannot fake through any external material modifications.
</p>

<p>
	See, you are trying to trick women into being attracted to the weak guy that you are, and you think that will work. And what I'm telling you is that won't work, and you should attract them legitimately by actually turning yourself into a strong masculine persona.
</p>

<p>
	But you want to cheat women. You think it will work. Well, good luck.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter how good you look, if your game sucks, you will not get good women.

	Your existence is a tautological necessity. It never depends on any statistical material conditions.
</p>

<p>
	Your chances of existing are 100%! Since here you are!

	Since you are here, you can't not not be here.

<p>
	There are many material reasons when you look at it from a statistical, collective perspective.
</p>

<p>
	But the nice thing about being a self is that you don't need to look at yourself from that perspective. As a self you can do many things which are otherwise statistically or collectively impossible or improbable.
</p>

<p>
	So, for example, the statistical, collective chance of your enlightenment is less than 1 in 10 million. But if you seriously want to become enlightened your chance is 100%. Becoming a millionaire is statistically far more likely than getting enlightened. And yet here we are talking about doing both.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry about how the game is rigged. Go be massively creative and you will overcome all the odds and rigging.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing stopping you from using your creative mind to invent some new gadget, product, service, or art which will generate $1 million in value.
</p>

<p>
	You could go write a popular song which will earn you more than $1 million. A single song! All you gotta do is invent it. A single fucking song! And yet here you are whining and playing victim.
</p>

<p>
	If you'd put as much energy into being creative as most people do in playing victim, you'd solve all your money problems.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not blaming or judging you. I'm just pointing out that you're creatively fucking lazy.
</p>

It remains to be seen though if this truly leads to America's downfall or to some revival.
</p>

<p>
	Although, given how radicalized the American right-wing has gotten, it doesn't look good.
</p>

<p>
	Trump has a 45% approval rating right now, which is just shameful.

<p>
	The schools I went to in Southern California were already basically at stage Green. I got taught sex-ed in 5th grade in the 1996. So Green is already happening in progressive school districts.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org teachings are more Yellow/Turquoise, which is a much trickier thing.

It’s really hard to have such a level of confidence in these kinds of environments. Is there some level of delusion involved or false bravado?

	Attracting the hottest women requires being like ice. And they will shit-test you to test your iceyness and detachment. If you fail the shit-tests -- if she can break your poise -- she will immediately lose interest.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is this: you will only be able to keep a girl who you can be icey with. If she can de-center you, you won't be able to keep her. If she is the prize and not you, you won't be able to keep her. You must be the prize.
</p>

<p>
	You can increase your cool by lots of experience dealing with shit-tests and rejection. It's also important to raise your entitlement to have the hottest girl. You must feel like you're fully entitled to it. MASSIVE ENTITLEMENT. Like you are a king. This means slaying all your insecurities.
</p>

<p>
	Hot girls are attracted to massive confidence and huge balls. You need to be the most confident guy in the room. Not through fakery. But actually.
</p>

<p>
	The hottest girls are basically attracted to sociopaths, narcissists, bosses, and ruthless scumbags.
</p>

	It's all YOU baby.

<p>
	The real question is, how do you accept anything less than Infinity?
