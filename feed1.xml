<p>
	Yup
</p>

<p>
	Everything is precisely backwards.
</p>

<p>
	God's Love is a tricky business. It cannot be biased the way you want it to be. God must love viruses as much as it loves humans.

<p>
	The right has its self-improvement ways. It's usually either mainstream religion or something like Jordan Peterson.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't expect it to be anything brilliant or cutting edge. It's gonna be conformist, traditional, and materialistic.
</p>

<p>
	Everything I teach is about questioning social dogmas, so by definition this will not sit well with right-wingers. They are not interested in deconstructing culture, they are interested in defending it. That's either whole MO.

			It‚Äôs like we‚Äôre being told something else in school and the reality is completely different. I was told you have to verbally ask a woman every time you do something.
		</p>

		<p>
			But here you are saying something else. That it‚Äôs okay to¬†touch and kiss under certain circumstances depending on her mood and setting. We, as men, are getting mixed messages from movies, songs, media, school, You, and friends.¬†
		</p>

		<p>
			<b>It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre saying, you can do it, probably need to do it, but it‚Äôs also kind of against the law and a taboo. As I understand this.</b>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	As with many other domains, school left you totally unperpared to handle the realities of dating and sex.
</p>

<p>
	School does not teach those realities at all.
</p>

<p>
	Dating and sexuality is highly context sensitive and implicit. It is also so tied in with survival that it must be tightly regulated by the powerful because they want to fuck the best people themselves. So they will tell you one thing but then actually do the opposite themselves in their own private sex lives.
</p>

<p>
	Harsh truths about sex are like harsh truths about spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Flirting, playful touching, and being a good salesmen are not against the law. It's not even taboo. It happens in nightclubs and bars everywhere in the world and is generally considered acceptable. But talking openly about it is often unacceptable, especially in the MeToo era.
</p>

<p>
	Do some guys take the flirting and touching overboard into rapey territory? Sure! Some do. But you can also do it in a decent manner. Go flirt with some girls. No problem. Never force yourself on her if she isn't smiling while you do it. Her facial experssion tells you everything. If she's laughing and smiling and looking deep in your eyes, you can basically rip¬†off her panties and do whatever you want. But as soon as her smile turns into a frown, that's when you stop. The key is to ATTRACT and CHARM her. This is very different than force.
</p>

<p>
	If it was truly unnecessary we would be able to easily eliminate it. But it's not so easy. So maybe it's more necessary than you imagine?

<p>
	But that's exactly what mankind has done for a million years. It's in your blood. You will do it when required or pay another to do it.
</p>

<p>
	We live in a complex economy where it's not feasible to do every detail of life yourself. A lot of ugly stuff is hidden within the vast complexity of the economy. And yet you cannot avoid the economy. Oil and gas might be killing the planet, but our economy cannot survive without it.

<p>
	I thought maybe I could try healing it and stopping it. But the more conscious I got, the more I realized it is Love and doesn't need my stopping it.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes to take away an obstacle is a disservice, weakening the student. Don't wish for life to be easier, wish for yourself to be stronger.
</p>

<p>
	This corona shit is just something mankind has to grapple with to reach the next level of evolution and love. You can't make all viruses disappear, more will come.¬†We must rebuild society to function better for more people.

<p>
	No

<p>
	You are not going to survive an Alaskan winter on fruits and vegetables.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to survive on vegan if you have certain health conditions.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to survive on raw vegan if you don't have enough money.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	The reason people eat what they eat is because that's what allows them to survive. Of course this can be changed, but not always. And survival is a much more complex affair than merely meeting your calorie needs.

<p>
	You can make an artform out of using toilet paper. The depth of any activity is as deep as you make it. You are creating the meaning behind it. So as long as you're able to trick yourself into thinking it's meaningful, it will appear meaningful to you.

	I never said that. Useful is whatever fits your survival agenda, which could be anything.

<p>
	In the end my opinion about any given activity is irrelevant. If you enjoy it and value in it, then do it.

	Shooting a ball into a hole is about as shallow as life gets. But hey! Maybe I'm the crazy one.

<p>
	Lol, pickup in the MeToo era is gonna be seriously misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with dating hot women is that they actually like be dominated. But good luck explaining that to a MeToo audience.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I am not advocating sexual assault or rape, but most of these Reddit people calling pickup "sexual assault" are doing a disservice to the term "sexual assault." Stuff that goes on at a strip club or night club is very different than stuff that goes on at work, for example. In a night club it is appropriate to touch women in sexual ways while obviously not at work. People go to nightclubs in order to let loose and be sexual. That doesn't justify rape or actual assault, but squeezing a girl's butt in a playful way at a nightclub is not assault. Many women expect to be manipulated into sex. It's not like you go up to a woman and ask her, "Hi there. Shall we have sex tonight? Yes or No?" That's not how dating works. The woman is going to play coy and she is going to make dumb excuses and make the guy chase her. That is the mating ritual.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if she ever gives you a hard "NO!", then you stop. But short of that, the guy is allowed to keep pressuring her because she will play games. It's not that big a problem. She should know if she wants sex or not. And if she doesn't, she should state so clearly and the guy should stop and things are fine.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest distinction between pickup and MeToo is that the MeToo sexual abuse cases often involve positions of authority at work, where a boss exploits his female staff. This is very different than two strangers flirting and hooking up at a nightclub or bar.¬† The situation is a lot more fair and balanced at the nightclub. The girl is free to reject the guy at any time with little consequence or threat to her. Flirting and even a bit of groping and kissing at a club is not sexual assault, it's business as usual. But at work, that's a big problem because the girl has no option to leave and the boss has too much leverage over her.
</p>

<p>
	All of life is imagined by God, so of course past lives are too. The entire past is. God has no life and no past unless it imagines one.
</p>

<p>
	This I have been directly conscious of.
</p>

<p>
	If some spiritual teacher is talking about past lives, that's your clue that they are not fully Awake. There is no life or past at all at the highest level of Consciousness.

<p>
	Yes. Since Consciousness is Unlimited, it is 100% in perfect communication with itself at all times, unless it chooses not to be.
</p>

<p>
	And even modern science validates this. If a flea jumps on a planet 100 million light years away, the rest of the universe knows about it instantly, although it might take millions of years for the light and gravity waves of that event to fully propagate through space and time. A flea jumping 100 million light years away affects every other point in the universe. Reality could not function without 100% perfect self-communication.

<title>Are green people really cognetively superior to blue people?</title>

<p>
	There are many levels to Green. Many people's Green runs only skin deep, as beliefs and ideology. It's like a Green veneer. It takes a lot of inner work to reach solid Green. You can't reach solid Green merely through adopting liberal beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	Few Democrats are solid Green. They are mostly Orange with a Green veneer. But most people don't know any better. So we get this wolf in sheep's clothing effect -- as seen with the corporate Dems.
</p>

<p>
	Never forget, there are always devils around who will try to convince the world that they are one color when they are actually a few colors lower. This makes understanding Spiral Dynamics a bit tricky. You have to really develop a keen eye.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Trump seems Orange, but he's got a solid Red foundation with a bunch of Orange veneer. And it fools A LOT of smart people, not to mention the dumb ones. So watch out for fakers.
</p>

<p>
	To be at solid Green requires not just beliefs but an opening of the heart. You have to really empathize with other beings around the world. This cannot be faked. It's an honest signal. And yes, good education in a highly developed society can help you to open your heart. Good education is not merely book-smarts.

<p>
	The one reality is the sum total of all the lenses/perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	Appearance¬†IS reality.
</p>

<p>
	Wahtever you are imagining becomes true for you. Because you are God, creating yourself.
</p>

<p>
	So if God wants to create a Mormon, he imagines himself being a Mormon for 80 years. And thus a Mormon is made. Until it is unmade. Which is why a Mormon must insist that he's real and not just something God imagines. To be a "Mormon" requires the denial that Mormons are imaginary. Now replace Mormon with scientist or human. That's why everyone is in denial about God, especially the religous and scientific folk.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you imagine the internet right now. If you stopped imagining it, you'd realize you are communicating with me right now directly, telepathically. Since I am just a fragment inside your own mind. But you need to deny that because you are attached to the idea of an external objective reality.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Environment is a huge factor.
</p>

<p>
	Yes! Just the mere fact of being born in a developed part of society makes you more developed. If you were born in the Congo or the Amazon rainforest, you would certainly be less developed. Because humans are not merely individual brains. We are a herd species with hive minds. You cannot survive as an individual at all.
</p>

<p>
	So-called Western values do have some advantages. In developed countries people are taught how to think more independently and skeptically. The education systems of each color are very different. A stage Blue Islamic school is not the same as a stage Green Montessori school. The first one indoctrinates, the second one teaches students how to think for themselves. Of course it's not perfect, Green can still have lots of indoctrination, but it's way better than Blue, which basically just enslaves your mind.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of educational development is about infrastructure, which is both physical and intellectual. It takes thousands¬†of years of intellectual infrastructure to produce high quality thinkers. This is not an individual accomplishment. You can't have an Einstein without the entire system that created him.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I can definitely confirm this is false.
</p>

<p>
	Personal sensitivity is a huge factor. You can easily validate this yourself by reading trip reports and tripping with a wide variety of friends. Your friends will react in very different ways to the same dose.
</p>

<p>
	At this point I have taken so much 5-MeO-DMT that I don't take any more. It's become too powerful for me. So not only does sensitively vary from person to person, it will change for you over time as you go deeper with each trip. So be careful. You will become more sensitive after some deep breakthroughs.

<p>
	Actually he has. Green is able to think more perspectivally, independently, relativistically, more compassionately than Blue. The Blue mind in some cases literally cannot compute Green's way of thinking, while Green can compute Blue. Although Green can struggle to understand Blue's inability to compute.
</p>

<p>
	This does NOT make Green superior in any absolute sense, but yes, relatively superior at the cognitive level.
</p>

<p>
	If you just compare a stage Blue thinker to a stage Green thinker, it's like a Toyota Corolla vs a BMW.
</p>

<p>
	Compare someone like Ben Shapiro vs Sam Seder. Totally different caliber of thinking. But that doesn't make Sam Seder always right or superior as a living being. There are much higher levels.

So there is no choice from God's POV. The only things God allows are Truth/Love because that what God IS.
</p>

<p>
	God is Absolute Perfection precisely because God is unconditional Love.
</p>

<p>
	But your ego-mind cannot understand this because it is stuck judging every bit of reality because you fear death. That's the illusion of survival. You're stuck in survival consciousness while God is not.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to this is radically raising your state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Choice does not exist. God is Absolute Love. Period. Nothing but Love exists. All else is misperception, which itself is also Absolute Love!
</p>

	Yes it does. Because that's how God's Goodness works. The "bad" is precisely there because it creates a higher Good.

	It doesn't matter if he does or does not reconcile with her. Her work is to forgive him and his work is forgive himself.

<p>
	No justice is needed.

			His friend Julien Blanc had a huge media scandal in 2014 where he was accused of rape as well. If you spent maybe an hour or 2 watching his content before it happened, you'd find out he actually teaches to take it slow, be able to take a step back, not make a girl uncomfortable etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			What RSD did to Todd Valentine was questionable but trust me, they are not rapists.

		<p>

<p>
	I stand by my points not only if all of them are rapists, but also murders. The judgment is your projection. That's the deep realization you must see if you want to reach the highest levels of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Or don't. It's fine either way.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not going to force you to love.

<p>
	You can find some artistry in sports. But that's not what the professional sports industry is designed to cater to. It is a business built on tribalism.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, you are free to do sports. I was merely explaining why you won't find a lot of high consciousness people in sports. That is all.
</p>

<p>
	You can turn rapid hot-dog eating into an art and compare it to Mozart. But don't be surprised when you don't find the highest grade of consciousness in your colleagues. And don't be surprised when it wrecks your body and you can't do it any more.
</p>

<p>
	A display of mastery is a rather Orange level thing. A true master doesn't need to strut around like a cock.

			Leo what are some ways in which I can move the prana upwards. I have the kriya yoga book from your book list and I can already feel the chi but it's very hard to move it upwards to have a kundalini awakening.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Those ways are some of the fastest, but still takes time.
</p>

<p>
	You can always do the techniques twice or even three times as much per day. But also, be careful what you wish for. Slow and steady is usually better than too much too fast.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga requires patience and steady discipline.

</p>

<p>
	In the end, out of all the potential things there are to do in this world, are you seriously going to devote your whole life to being good a throwing or hitting a ball?
</p>

<p>
	Do you see how shallow that is in the grande scheme of things? Once you see that -- which takes some higher consciousness -- then you're not likely to get seduced by that illusion.
</p>

<p>
	But, of course, you're free to do as you like. I'm just explaining why you're not going to find a lot of highly conscious people in sports. Sports is an industry designed for cavemen, not sages.

<p>
	Vegan diet does not work for all people.
</p>

<p>
	So there is the "need".
</p>

<p>
	Judgment of meat-eating is, in a sense, a worse offense than the meat-eating itself. Because by rejecting meat-eaters you reject yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same problem as judging criminals or terrorists. It seems reasonable and justified, but it rots your mind and soul and keeps you from the highest levels of consciousness and love.
</p>

<p>
	Vegans don't appreciate the spiritual complexities of this issue. They like to think from their own POV, which is ironic considering how they care about the POV of animals. But what about the POV humans?

	Yes, most people will need to send out many applications because most jobs are simply not the right fit and you won't know that ahead of time without applying and interviewing.

</p>

<p>
	If you can't see the value of the above video, regardless of whether¬†Owen is a rapist or a murderer, then you're missing something.
</p>

<p>
	People are not good or bad. People are morally complex. Often their bad parts are redeemed by their good parts.
</p>

<p>
	Owen is a very complex guy. He has a troubled and¬†criminal past. Which is what will make his final transformation so inspiring if he pulls it off. He knows all this and it fuels him.

<p>
	No, you can't stop those things through argument. In fact, if you argue about that, you'll likely spur it on.
</p>

<p>
	Try to distinguish between discussion/advice/logic vs argumentation.
</p>

<p>
	Logically explaining the consequences of someone's action to them CAN help them to rethink their behaviors. But not argumentation.

<p>
	It could develop your writing skills.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see how it will get you any closer to the publishing industry, as that's more of a sales/marketing/biz domain.
</p>

<p>
	Being a writer is TOTALLY different from being a publisher.
</p>

<p>
	Decide clearly on what you actually want. Do you want to write amazing books or do you want sell/publish the books of other people?
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be great writer, you will never achieve that merely through a degree. You must be writing non-stop in your own free time. That's how true writing skills are developed. Plan to invest 10,000 hours in writing on your own time for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be a publisher, look into degrees about marketing and biz.

<p>
	In general, you shouldn't major in a thing unless you can see yourself working many years in that field.
</p>

<p>
	Are you going to be working in math or engineering for at least 10 years? Philosophy? Then don't bother. You don't have time to waste on that shit. Time is too precious.
</p>

<p>
	Find the thing you can work 10 years in at least.

	You can always ask directly: "What would your ideal candidate look like?" Then try to actually fit that.
</p>

<p>
	You can also ask, "Do you have any hesitations hiring me? What are they? Let me address them and show you why I'm the best you'll find for this position."

</p>

<p>
	If you had the proper skills, resume, interview process, and presentation -- you'd get the job.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it from the employer's POV: as an employer you would NEVER hire a person based on random draw or luck. Why would you play dice with your business? That'd be foolish. You're always looking to hire the best person that is available at a reasonable price. You are screening out people who aren't the best fit.
</p>

<p>
	Employers NEVER pick candidates by throwing around darts. Employers are looking for every specific markers, so getting hired is about knowing those markers and nail them. Each job has different markers, requiring a customized approach.
</p>

<p>
	As with most of the realizations we talk about, it's not a binary. It's not merely a matter of getting it or not. It's a question of how deeply do you get it?
</p>

<p>
	If you ask the average person off the street whether people look at the world through different lenses, he would say, "YES! Of course! Duh!"
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean he has even begun to understand the ramifications of what that means. Does he understand that there is no reality independent of the lens one is looking through? Does he understand that terrorism, rape, and incest are relative lenses? Does he understand that physical reality is a relative lens?
</p>

<p>
	Not unless he's Yellow or above. And even then, he still doesn't understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	Truth cannot be argued or argued with.
</p>

<p>
	The more one argues, the less truth one understands.
</p>

<p>
	Have you noticed that the most argumentative people are the most false?
</p>

<p>
	And the most truthful people are the least argumentative?
</p>

<p>
	Why is that? How do you explain that?

</p>

<p>
	The greatest power is not to demand everyone be squeaky clean but to love everyone despite all their devilry. The bigger the devil, the greater your opportunity to demonstrate your love.
</p>

<p>
	When you require people not to be devils, that's actually coming from lack of total self-acceptance. The devil cannot be avoided, the devil must be accepted as your self.

<p>
	I doubt there was any awakening here at all.
</p>

<p>
	How is medication gonna awaken you?
</p>

<p>
	Way too much jumping to conclusions here. Such overly generalized statements can be dangerous because none of know what this user is really describing. The user himself might not know.
</p>

<p>
	This work requires precision and clarity. If you are facing a spiritual problem, please describe it extra clearly and carefully so there's no ambiguity and we can give you clear answers.

<p>
	That could be a very convenient defense mechanism for your ego.
</p>

<p>
	Criticism and judgment are red-flags for ignorance and falsehood. When you in possession of Truth, you don't judge or criticize much, you appreciate even ignorant people.

<p>
	What do you mean when you say "spiritual awakening"?
</p>

<p>
	And what does this have to do with meditation, meds, and mental hospitals?
</p>

<p>
	Be careful making such broad general statements. They are easily misunderstood, even by yourself, let alone others.
</p>

<p>
	What is your mental health history prior to meditation?
</p>

<title>Sharing my path: RASA, Depression, Psychedelics, Ashram, Romantic Love</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/47071-sharing-my-path-rasa-depression-psychedelics-ashram-romantic-love/?do=findComment&amp;comment=596104</link>

<p>
	Be careful with RASA, shaktipat, and this whole Ramaji gang. They are not deeply Awake and following them too closely will lead to delusions. Not to mention that they harbor dogmas and ignorance against psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you reach "1000", that's still a joke compared to true Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You should not rely on a guru to Awaken you. Ultimately it will not work. Which is not to say you shouldn't experiment and try various techniques. For those of you for whom RASA has helped, great. But just know, there's much more beyond RASA.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Anything is possible. But my thyroid disease was diagnosed over 10 years ago, before I started Actualized.org
</p>

<p>
	So be careful about jumping to conclusions. Such health issues can be very complex and involve many independent variables.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I don't feel that psychedelics affect my thyroid one way or another. But of course you never know how some new chemical might affect your body in unknown ways. That is true of all medication, supplements, and even food.
</p>

<p>
	That human is you.
</p>

<p>
	Stop being lazy and expecting others to prove your own nature to you.
</p>

<p>
	You are Infinite Consciousness, which means you are capable of Total Omniscience and infinite telepathic ability. But it takes serious work. This isn't for dabblers or naysayers.
</p>

<p>
	Intellectual honesty is good. But it doesn't make you right.
</p>

<p>
	Once you completely deconstruct materialism, telepathy becomes quite a reasonable possibility. QM shows us that two particles can communicate instantly across cosmic spacial distances. That's a tiny clue that Consciousness is not seperated from itself in any fundamental way. Consciousness can know all¬†parts of itself instantly. That's what Absolute means.

I would say take a psychedelic and let is show you some things. That then gives you some idea of what you're working towards.
</p>

<p>
	It's really hard to work towards something when you have no clue what it looks like.
</p>

<p>
	For me the biggest value of psychedelics is that they showed the possibilities of developing one's consciousness which I could not imagine in my wildest dreams otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people meditate and self-inquire, but they have no clue what they're really missing, what the full potential is. And so it's hard for them to be serious about it.

			I suppose the underlying question I‚Äôm mostly asking is how do I know I‚Äôm on the right path? How do I know who the right teacher is? And who can I trust ? I can‚Äôt trust myself? I can‚Äôt trust anyone else? How do I know that looking for truth will not lead me to greater delusion?¬†

<p>
	That is the whole problem in a nutshell. There is no easy answer here. It requires a serious commitment to personal investigation while keeping a very open mind and being willing to change directions and admit mistakes.
</p>

<p>
	In the end you are the TRUTH, so you cannot have anyone else get it for you. But of course many people can¬†assist in your awakening process. Sometimes the assistance will be deeply counter-intuitive: the teachers who mislead you the most might be exactly what you needed to ultimately Awaken.
</p>

<p>
	There are many ways to Awaken. A brutal approach is not necessary unless you feel that's what you need.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I find a loving approach works better for me. You may discover the same. Sometimes the harder you push the less it works. So learning surrender can be¬†crucial.
</p>

<p>
	When in doubt, listen to your heart. Listen to love over fear.
</p>

<p>
	You will never go wrong with Love because Love is Truth. One day you will understand. But probably not for a while.

<title>Three Card Tarot Readings (Non-Psychic)</title>

<p>
	Guys, watch how easily you are willing to surrender your authority and responsibility for self-reflection to someone else.
</p>

<p>
	If you're serious about growing up, ponder whether doing so is a good idea.
</p>

<p>
	No disrespect to Emerald. But this can turn into a disservice for people. You must learn to stand up on your own two feet rather than asking an online stranger what your life purpose should be, etc.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know any of this is correct? Are you willing to stake your life on it?
</p>

<p>
	If you're just doing this to have fun, okay. But some people here look way too eager to have a stranger give them marching orders for life, which is not in the spirit of self-actualization. It is critical that you learn to listen to your heart and trust yourself more than any Tarot card.
</p>

<p>
	God is speaking through your heart. Why the fuck aren't you listening?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Pretty much everyone needs those things unless you are going to become a full-time monk.
</p>

<p>
	So it's a question of whether you want to be a householder or a monk. There's no right answer. It's all about what you want.
</p>

<p>
	At an age so young, you've got plenty of time to build up a decent life for yourself (over the next 10 years let's say) and then you can abandon it later if you want to go hardcore monk. Or you can have that householder life established and waiting for you after you return from your spiritual quest.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming a monk at 19 is too extreme for most people. That would only be if you know for sure that your destiny is to be a full-time hardcore Buddha. But it even took The Buddha til 27 to leave his household and till 30-something to reach enlightenment.

<p>
	Seems hard to deny that.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying you should do it. Just saying it's a possibility.
</p>

<p>
	I would not be talking about it unless I had been thrust into it, and had to seriously evaluate where this is a place I want to go. Not a thing you want to stumble into by accident.

<p>
	The problem with mahasamadhi is that it doesn't really lend itself to documentation. If you're doing it, you will not give a damn about this world. You are basically choosing to destroy the dream world in favor of pure Infinity. So there will be no one to benefit from your documentation. Not to mention it's hard to post a video of yourself killing yourself. YouTube would shut it down.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I think I reached a point with 5-MeO-DMT in which a mahasamadhi might be possible -- if one really wanted to push for it.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is unproven.
</p>

<p>
	It took me about 80 trips. The mind becomes so indifferent to all differences that it seems to mirror Sadhguru's descriptions of what mahasamadhi requires: a totally equanimus mind which does not differentiate between anything and does not want to differentiate between anything. This is Love in its purest form.

<p>
	Maybe, but that's not what I understand currently. I understand it to be permanent pure Infinity/Love, and that's the end. The dream world is transcended and realized to never have existed.
</p>

<p>
	The way to escape the dream world is to realize that its only function was to teach you that reality is LOVE. Once this is fully recognized, that's it! The function of the dream world has been achieved. It was only a staging ground for the ultimate self-realization. Everything is Absolute Infinity. Period. This level of consciousness gives you complete omniscience. At which point you know yourself so completely that you are done. There cannot be anything more. You are Totally ONE, forever.

<title>Leo saying sadhguru is not awake</title>

<p>
	About Sadhguru, I will say this. After studying him a bit closer, and in light of my recent awakenings, I think he's more awake than I originally thought. I think he's a masterful teacher and yogi.
</p>

<p>
	Given the tricky business of trying to guess another teachers' degree of awakeness, I will refrain from making definitive statements and instead just caution you guys not to take it for granted that your favorite teacher/guru is at the highest level. Be skeptical, but also open-minded and fair -- and acknowledge excellence where you see it.
</p>

<p>
	There is much valuable stuff you can learn from Sadhguru. I would not want to denigrate his work. But also keep in mind that there may be higher levels. How would you know? You see? That's the key point. The trick is to learn from teachers without getting stuck with their limits. Of course this applies to me as well.
</p>

	That would be the point of becoming a Bodhisattva.
</p>

<p>
	It does feel pretty selfish to just leave everyone behind without helping them.
</p>

<p>
	I think most of you guys should stay away from Mahasamadhi. Don't even think about it. It's only a thing the most radical spiritual seekers should consider when they reach that level. Most people just want some basic satori or God-realization and embodiment.

<p>
	That's the thing. Once you become conscious enough, teaching people becomes pointless since they are just you.

<p>

<p>
	By definition Mahasamadhi means your body drops dead at the moment of total realization.
</p>

<p>
	Technically speaking though, your body does not drop dead. Rather, you become so Conscious that you realize that your body and world never even existed. And finally you decide to stop imagining them. And so everything ends. This is DEATH.

<p>
	For me it is both. It helps a lot to do the same psychedelic over and over again. And it helps to do various ones at times, so that you get a better contrast and appreciation for their differences. It should all build on itself. At least it did for me.

<p>
	That's the mindfuck. There is no outsiders perspective. You are imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	Once you realize this. All others disappear as if they never existed -- because they never did!
</p>

<p>
	You are Absolute. That means it's just you and your imagination imagining shit.

			How would that be different to the events that happened to Ramana, Eckhart, Sean Webb, Francis Lucille¬†etc? ¬†
		</p>

		<p>
			Take this excerpt from Francis Lucille for example:
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>I was sitting in silence, meditating in my living room with two friends. It was too early to fix dinner, our next activity. Having nothing to do, expecting nothing, I was available. My mind was free of dynamism, my body relaxed and sensitive, although I could feel some discomfort in my back and in my neck.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>After some time, one of my friends unexpectedly began to chant a traditional incantation in Sanskrit, the Gayatri Mantra. The sacred syllables entered mysteriously in resonance with my silent presence which seemed to become intensely alive. I felt a deep longing in me, but at the same time a resistance was preventing me from living the current situation to the fullest, from responding with all my being to this invitation from the now, and from merging with it. As the attraction toward the beauty heralded by the chant increased, so did the resistance, revealing itself as a growing fear that transformed into an intense terror.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>At this point, I felt that my death was imminent, and that this horrendous event would surely be triggered by any further letting go on my behalf, by any further welcoming of that beauty. I had reached a crucial point in my life. As a result of my spiritual search, the world and its objects had lost their attraction. I didn‚Äôt really expect anything substantial from them. I was exclusively in love with the Absolute, and this love gave me the boldness to jump into the great void of death, to die for the sake of that beauty, now so close, that beauty which was calling me beyond the Sanskrit words.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>As a result of this abandon, the intense terror which had been holding me instantaneously released its grip and changed into a flow of bodily sensations and thoughts which rapidly converged toward a single thought, the I-thought, just as the roots and the branches of a tree converge toward its single trunk. In an almost simultaneous apperception, the personal entity with which I was identifying revealed itself in its totality. I saw its superstructure, the thoughts originating from the I-concept and its infrastructure, the traces of my fears and desires at the physical level. Now the entire tree was contemplated by an impersonal eye, and both the superstructure of thoughts and the infrastructure of bodily sensations rapidly vanished, leaving the I-thought alone in the field of consciousness. For a few moments, the pure I-thought seemed to vacillate, just as the flame of an oil lamp running out of fuel, then vanished.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>At that precise moment, the immortal background of Presence revealed itself in all its splendor.</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			<i>-</i>
		</p>

		<p>
			So according to you this kind of ‚Äòfinal‚Äô awakening is just a joke, am I right? Sorry for hacking away at you with this but I have to in order to clarify things for myself.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not a joke. That's pretty good. Sounds like Nirvakalpa samadhi.
</p>

<p>
	To me though, that's still not God-realization and not Love-realization, so not the highest level.
</p>

<p>
	But find out for yourself. I'm just putting questions in your mind.

		<p>
			Does you research confirm this too?

		<p>
			Seems too crazy. Samadhi it supposed to show there's no duality. When you "come back" you are just imagining yourself¬† again to be a human.
		</p>

		<p>
			But this mahasamadhi seems to say you can end the imagination for ever. Wtf?
		</p>

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	Life and reality both are imaginary. To become fully conscious is to exit the game of life entirely into eternal Love. Not for the faint of heart.

<p>
	I don't consider Ken Wilber Awake. Hard to explain why I know that.
</p>

<p>
	If you read Ken's memoirs, seems like he still suffers and deals with a lot of human BS.
</p>

<p>
	Part of the trick is how you define "suffering". People like to use different definitions.

It needs to become a consistent process that keeps deepening itself with every trip. Similar to meditation.
</p>

<p>
	20, 40, 60, 100 trips, each one taking you deeper. Of course, these trips must be carefully spaced out so you have time to integrate the insights. Might take years.
</p>

<p>
	After 100 trips now, my depth of consciousness has become so profound that I fear if I take any more, I will simply leave my body into Infinity. It is nothing like what it was when I first began.
