<p>
	Everything is totally relative. You cannot ground reality in any thing.
</p>

<p>
	Any form you say is fundamental, isn't.
</p>

<p>
	QM hit its face against this brick wall.

		<p>
			Is it total transcendence of knowledge or is it the religious omniscience like knowing everything under the sun, like you were knowing my thoughts and having the same subjective experience of me, instantly knew whats the result of 1\84849593 instantly etc. at that time as well?
		</p>

<p>
	Total omniscience simply cannot be explained in any way. In that moement you are conscious of how you designed the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	It is God's total omniscience. It goes way beyond knowledge. It is the whole universe.

<p>
	Even if you meet a person you will still not know their degree of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	I have always said that talking about other people's enlightenment is speculative.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless, speculate you will. Some of you here speculate poorly.

They are not. Since there is no one to say what is nothing and what is something, they become identical.
</p>

<p>
	Reality cannot know whether it is something or nothing. So it is both at once.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Some degree of realization of no-self.
</p>

<p>
	The attachment with being exclusively identified with the body must be broken.
</p>

<p>
	This is usually called stream-entry in Buddhism or kensho in Zen.
</p>

<p>
	There are much much deeper levels.
</p>

<p>
	Total omniscience is possible. I recently peaked into total omnisicence. It's so fucking radical.

<p>
	Full bliss? Lol
</p>

<p>
	You expect an enlightened master to always be bubbly for you? You will be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not limited to any one emotional state. Most enlightened masters look so ordinary and normal that you would never know they were enlightened, like a cat sitting on a windowsill. It does not need to satisfy any of your expectations. It's just sitting and being.

	Well that is definitely true.

	Not sure why this would make you doubt his enlightenment.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Baseline human awareness is not high enough to notice the Eternity of NOW. Human consciousness is deliberately time-bound to aid your survival.
</p>

<p>
	Eternity will only become noticable through practices or psychedelics. But Eternity is always the case. It is always NOW, NOW, NOW. Every temporal experience is actually eternal and has existed forever. But you aren't noticing it.
</p>

<p>
	You must realize that you are inside the Absolute at all times. The relative is actually the Absolute when looked at deeply enough.

<p>
	None of that comes anywhere close to 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Many Western enlightened masters have taken LSD. But LSD ain't good enough.
</p>

<p>
	Shinzen probably is open enough. But I would worry it might kill him. Him's pretty old.
</p>

<p>
	A full-on 5-MeO breakthrough is a terrifying thing. It will give you a panic attack.

</p>

<p>
	God both created itself, and it has always existed. Because existence, creation, intelligence, being, will, truth, understanding, and love are all one.

			It would be interesting to get a zen mastery of 40 plus years of practice to take 5meo 20 times and see what he says, maybe then we would get our answer? Maybe Shinzen young as he is looking at finding a faster way to awakening. Tho I'm not sure he's as deeply awake as someone like sadguru

<p>
	The problem with offering an old man 5-MeO is that I don't wanna kill the poor guy.
</p>

<p>
	I offered it to Ralston. He refused, ridiculing me.

<p>
	Closedmindness is a hell of an obstacle to this work. A person with 40 years experience is also a know-it-all in his own mind.

	You need to find a unique and underserved need in the marketplace and invent a creative and effective solution for it, providing people with massive value.
</p>

<p>
	That is the heart of business. Everything else is distraction. What you eat and when you wake up is irrelevant. Business is a very concrete thing. Try not to muddy that with a bunch of cute self-help ideas or philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	"How can I add massive value to the world??" << that should be your top question when thinking about biz. If you're not adding real concrete massive value, you will not succeed.

	Your mind is very strong. Even after a terrifying experience you will return to homeostasis quite fast. A week later you will be back to normal in most cases.

<p>
	Did I say that? If so, it was just a metaphor. Don't take it literally.
</p>

<p>
	This technique is not a replacement for meditation. Rather where it shines is in dredging up latent emotional baggage, which meditation does only very slowly.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation's primary purpose is not dredging up emotional baggage. You can spend years meditating, and become a good meditator, but you may still carry deep emotional baggage.

Since your body is totally infinite and omnipresent. The human body is no more you than a brick wall. I was looking at a brick wall the other night and I could not tell the wall apart from my body. The wall is as much my body as my body.
</p>

<p>
	Being immortal is not about living forever through time. It is realizing that each moment is eternal already and that there is nowhere else for God to go. God cannot go anywhere because God is everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	You will not become enlightened. Rather enlightenment will reveal that your birth was just an idea, a story. The story of you will be erased. What will remain is omnipresent consciousness, which is God. Your perceptual field will be radically recontextualized and realized to be the body of God.
</p>

<p>
	You are not understanding just how radical enlightenment/God/no-self is! It's so radical you cannot imagine it, and it does not fit that materialistic paradigm you're using. That whole paradigm of a physical world will be wiped out at the moment of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	There never was a self.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!

There is a clear biological stake people have in their offspring. Their progeny is in effect their own fucking cell!! They love themselves................! Now, this affection is no way near as strong from the other end, meaning the offspring's love for the parent doesn't even come anywhere close. Basically the children are part of the parents' bodies but not the other way around!! However, metaphysically speaking, sperm and egg might be all part of a big false narrative and in that case ALL the above goes out the window!!!

	What you have yet to realize is that the entire universe is your body, every grain of sand on every beach of every planet is your child.
</p>

<p>
	Not figuratively. Literally!
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing which is not your direct offspring.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize that, you will understand Absolute Love.
</p>

<p>
	Limiting yourself to your body is the grand illusion which we are here to overcome.
</p>

<p>
	This is the larger reality to which you are being pointed to.
</p>

<p>
	Discover Absolute Love and you will become a better parent too.

<p>
	And even if you love your child very much under all conditions. That's still such a narrow love. What about the other 1 billion children on this planet? Why don't you love them too?

	Learning does not require blindly believing things. If you were serious, you'd be here to learn. But your cup is full and you're here to double down on your existing worldview, which is the opposite of the purpose of my teachings.
</p>

<p>
	If you do not want to learn from me, then you should not be here.
</p>

<p>
	Learning from me does not require blind belief. But it does require an open mind and a willingness to lay aside your existing worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Your choice of username betrayed your ideological position from day one. You are just here acting out a materialist program, like a robot. You are not questioning yourself but instead fighting externally.

Just in various forms. Sometimes twisted ones.
</p>

<p>
	Is a parent's love genuine love? Yes, but it is still quite narrow and conditional. There are many things your child can do which will make you stop loving it.
</p>

<p>
	And certainly not all parents love their children. Some parents are much better at it than others. But even the best parents still don't know what universal unconditional love is. They know love only within that narrow context of their child.
</p>

<p>
	Wait till you experience God's infinite universal unconditional love. Then you'll understand why I say that parental love (although good) is like a drop compared to an ocean.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I agree that parenting can be a big growing opportunity. But it will not deliver you to Absolute Love. That requires spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	What's really amazing is when you realize that murderers, thieves, and genocidal dictators are all acting out of love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is as diverse as all the objects in the universe.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I say that things I say is because I am trying to point you towards discovering Absolute Love -- a thing which you have not yet discovered.
</p>

<p>
	Past life regression is a common hypnosis technique. You could try that and see if anything interesting comes up. There's no guarantees.
</p>

<p>
	Other than that, hardcore yoga would be your best bet.
</p>

<p>
	Once you realize consciousness is all things, you'll understand that you/it will live through all possible points of view.
</p>

<p>
	Large doses of psychedelics also help. If you mega-dose some mushrooms you will see some crazy shit that will be totally out of this world. Be careful what you wish for. This is no joke. You are not ready to know such things.

<p>
	I grew up in a dysfunctional family. Not as dysfunctional as yours, but still.
</p>

<p>
	The most important thing to do is move out and become as independent as possible. From there you can start collecting the pieces.
</p>

<p>
	Don't feel bad about leaving them. At your age you gotta learn to survive independently of them. This will also make you feel powerful rather than a victim.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry too much. You can overcome and heal all that childhood crap. It will take work, but it can be done for sure and you will later be grateful for that it taught you.
</p>

<p>
	Hang in there for now. Do the best you can to break free. Create a practical plan for moving out and work that plan a bit each day.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I would recommend 1) distancing yourself from your family, limiting your contact with them at least for now, and 2) going to therapy to talk all this out. You don't want to keep traumatic stuff bottled up inside. You gotta talk it out so you get perspective and distance on it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics might also be very helpful, although also painful as they will force you to confront uncomfortable things. But in the end it will be healing. They can show you true love.
</p>

<p>
	If you live with your family your #1 priority should be to get a job and move out. That alone will help a lot.
</p>

			how do you know this is true though if you haven't had the experience of a zen master practicing for 40 years? I'm not saying you're wrong or even right but consider the qualities someone might have developed if they have been practicing intelligently and disciplined for 40 years. There may be a piece of the puzzle one has there that allows them to see things in a different way than others wont due to lack of experience and discipline.

<p>
	Some things in life you can only intuit. Not everything is absolute knowledge. We deal with a lot of uncertainties in this work because we never have perfect information. We cannot crawl into a person's head to know how awake they are. But we nevertheless have to make some assessments of it in order to determine who is worth learning from.
</p>

<p>
	I have interacted with and interviewed masters with 40 years of experience. And I see gaps in their understanding of reality/God. I feel like I have become conscious of some things they have not. Of course this is a grey area. It involves some guesswork.
</p>

<p>
	No doubt 40 years of discipline is a powerful thing and comes with many benefits which you could not get any other way. But it does not guarantee the highest levels of consciousness or understanding.

			What do you think of of the issue that by reading about all this stuff the psychedelics will just dig it out of your memory and bring it to the front. So how can you ever be sure that its an insight into the absolute and not just some random stuff that you then project the non-dual theory on?
		</p>

		<p>
			Isnt this the same thing that the materialist does, that he looks around the world and interprets and explains everything though his materialist model which in turn makes this model seem more and more true?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That sounds like it would be a big problem but in practice it just isn't because the psychedelic takes you so far beyond mental conceptual stuff.
</p>

<p>
	When you actually become infinite, it will be no theory.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics create a change in one's state of consciousness. This is very different from constructing models or doing analysis.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is absolute. It is not a memory or a projection. It cannot be doubted.

<title>Best Long Term Consciousness Retreats?</title>

There are insights, there are states, and there is your baseline level of consciousness. All of them can be affected.
</p>

<p>
	You certainly cannot maintain a peak 5-MeO-DMT state because you would barely be able to walk. But it changes you even though you drop down. The sense of self is expended beyond your body.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, do both is the suggestion.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	No, you will not be anywhere close to that conscious. You will be lucky to get a few glimpses. But the value of the work is not just in getting glimpses. There's a lot more lessons than just enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Most of Peter's apprentices are not enlightened at all, not to even speak of deep enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Which is not to say anything negative about his programs. They are great. But you are grossly underestimating the amount of work it takes to awaken that deeply. I have watched his apprentices struggling and struggling and failing and failing to grasp what they are or what reality is.
</p>

<p>
	Not to brag, but I have awoken deeper than any of Peter's apprentices who I have met. And that is thanks to 5-MeO-DMT. Such degrees of consciousness would take you 40 years of work to attain.
</p>

<p>
	Total omniscience is possible. But you won't get that through any kind of apprenticeship program.
</p>

<p>
	Still, I recommend his programs. It's not the program's fault you are so asleep <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	If you're not using 5-MeO-DMT you're looking at 10, 20, 30, 40 years of work to reach the highest levels. The reality is, you will probably never even know you missed the highest levels because you will be so far away from them even after 40 years of work. Unless if you are supernaturally gifted. And that assumes you're working your ass off on this work, not just half-assing it the way most people do.
</p>

<p>
	It's still worth doing the work. So don't get discouraged. Just don't ignore the most powerful and direct tool there is for awakening. It would be negligent to do so.
</p>

<p>
	You will not understand Peter's full depth without psychedelic assistance, I can promise you that.
</p>

<p>
	None of this is to discourage you. Just the opposite, it just shows you how deep this work goes. So get excited! You have a lot of room for growth.
</p>

But you'd need massive, massive enlightenment for that.
</p>

<p>
	At the very center of the onion is God. If you fully become God, you will become a walking, talking vehicle for God's Love on Earth. Literally. You will walk around radiating God's Love to the whole world. Very few people get this far.
</p>

<p>
	You won't just be a vehicle for God, you will actually be the one true God. At this point your life is totally selfless and devoted to the betterment of all of living beings. Your love for the world will be infinite and you will be in paradise all the time. You will need nothing because you have become everything.
</p>

<p>
	The certification itself is basically irrelevant. What you really care about is finding the best program which teaches you how to be great coach and the business aspects of coaching.
</p>

<p>
	IPEC is the program I completed. It's quite good. It taught me valuable skills which I would not have learned any other way.
</p>

<p>
	Can't speak about any others since I only have experience with that one.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I have very little info about it.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like a decent spiritual community. Keep in mind that any community will be somewhat cult-like. But I don't think Isha is too bad. Although I don't know. The trick with real cults is that they hide their activities behind fake pleasant fronts. But from what I can sense about Sadhguru he is too responsible to allow Isha to be a proper cult. I don't think he would stand for it. After Sadhguru dies, then I would expect some serious problems to hit Isha as his followers wrestle for power with no authoritative voice like Sadhguru to guide them.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with building large organizations is that once the founder dies, it will easily get co-opted by devils and turned into a machine for devilry. That's one of the reasons I keep Actualized.org small.

<p>
	You cannot extract 5-MeO-DMT from plants, which is how most N,N-DMT is made. Very few people synthesize N,N-DMT in a lab from scratch. It can be done but from what I know these methods are not readily known. And the precursor chemicals will be watched by government agencies who will arrest you for purchasing them.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bad idea to get involved with that.

The insights can be hard to make sense of.
</p>

<p>
	It helps very much to have a solid theoretical foundation in nonduality and spirituality beforehand. Which means reading lots of books and developing a theoretical framework. That helps me a lot. So when I trip and I see some new insight I can say, "Oh, hey, that's what that Zen master was talking about!" or, "Hey! That's what that yogi was talking about!"
</p>

<p>
	If you come into psychedelics with zero study, you will be so lost. You won't be able to make sense of it.
</p>

<p>
	Watching my videos should help a lot with this. People who trip need to watch my videos.
</p>

Your actually the reason I didn’t go about doing it already and try changing the world! You basically implied that if your not enlightened you’ll start a cult and to me that translated to if your an ego, you’ll basically be raising a cult! Bruv your actually the reason why I’ve been confused for like 5 months about this now. Ever since you showed me my hood upbringing was cultish and that’s the reason I saw the world as evil from that perspective

<p>
	Well, you also don't want to be so paranoid about that that you become paralyzed and don't help the world at all.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to be perfect to improve the world. That's too high a standard which few people can meet.
</p>

<p>
	Try to help the world as best as you can while being careful not to start a cult or do harm. That's all. Be very self-aware and open to feedback. Be careful with constructing or preaching ideologies. That's where a lot of harm can happen.

<title>The trickiness of Projection</title>

Thanks for taking the time to respond. How would you define projection then? I wouldn't doubt my understanding of it is flawed. Or perhaps you have a video on it I missed I could watch? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Projection is when you judge another for the very same thing which you yourself are doing. The judgment is an exteriorization of your own guilt and self-judgment. But by projecting this bad trait out onto some "other" you can avoid looking at it within yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The classic example is this:
</p>

<p>
	Let's say you were raised to believe that homosexuality is a sin for which you will get sent to hell. But you find yourself having mild homosexual urges. But you cannot admit this to yourself so instead to get angry at some flaming homosexual on TV. So you start to badmouth that homosexual and you vow to punch him in the face if you ever meet him in person. All of this is really just you denying your own homosexuality.
</p>

<p>
	Scientific studies show that men who hate homosexuals are more likely to be sexually aroused when they are shown naked photographs of men than those who do not hate homosexuals.
</p>

<p>
	Another example would be: If you're acting like a selfish devil and you start calling other people selfish devils, that's projection. Or if you're cheating on your taxes but you get angry that rich people don't pay enough taxes, that's projection.
</p>

<p>
	For example: Donald Trump will call any news he doesn't like Fake News when in fact he is the biggest purveyor of fake news. He will call people liars when he is the biggest liar there ever was. He will call investigations of him biased because he is the most biased President there ever was. He will complain about rigged elections because he himself was rigging the election.
</p>

<p>
	In general the ego wants to be as selfish as possible while denying that it is in fact being selfish at all (because this allows it to be even more selfish!) So the best way to do that is to divert attention way from its own selfishness by point out the selfishness of others. If everyone around me is so selfish, then I'm actually an angel. And that's precisely the self-image I want to have so that I can justify being more selfish. If I see myself as the least selfish person in the world, that suits me just great. Now I got a lot of selfishness to make up for <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> Now I can steal, rape, and kill without guilt.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This is too loose a definition of projection. Projection is a very specific thing. Not every statement is projection. By taking that sloppy stance you dilute the meaning of the term and actually normalize projection.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that I and others can always be wrong about things. I never say I'm perfect in my assessments of situations. When I call someone a devil usually it's not a projection but something that's quite obvious they're doing. Of course sometimes it could be a projection. But mostly it isn't.
</p>

<p>
	When you see that a child is behaving foolishly by playing with matches, that's not projection. That's your higher wisdom and experience warning you of an impending problem. It would be foolish of you to allow him to play with those matches. The problem there is legitimate, he cannot see it, but you can. There is a good reason we don't let kids play with matches.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of having wisdom is that you're able to accurately distinguish between foolish and wise actions. It's not always perfect. But you can get pretty damn good at it. That's why experience is so valuable. So when I call someone a devil, that's usually coming from a deep set of experience. I can see the epistemic traps that people are falling into which they are not able to see yet. Often because I have fallen into those traps myself in the past.

<p>
	It's always a matter of inching our way upward. We don't need to get rid of all ideology. We can start split-testing certain concrete policies immediately. For example we can easily split test legalization of marijuana. Reasonable people can agree to such an idea.
</p>

<p>
	We can even split-test the building of a Mexican border fence. Just put massive gates along the fence which we can open at any time to nullify the barrier.
</p>

<p>
	The point of doing a public split-test is so that after the test is done people agree to whatever the results are. It's a consensus building device.
</p>

<p>
	I never smoke it. Plugging is my fave method.
</p>

<p>
	Freebase can be converted to salt fairly easily or even just the freebase itself should be pluggable when dissolved in oil or something besides water. I have yet to validate the plugging of freebase. I'll have some news on that soon.
</p>

<p>
	The Glass Vapor Genie is good for vaping. Meth pipes also work of course, but they can be a bit hard to control. They can burn easily. The Glass Vapor Genie will work much better.

			the only way to solve the problem
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, there are many ways to solve problems and I was just giving one example of a possible Tier 2 solution. It's certainly not the only method I would use.
</p>

<p>
	Split-testing ideologies is really not that good because ideology itself is the problem. Ideally we would create an education system which teaches children so well about how ideology works that all ideology would be wiped out within a few generations. Of course this will never be allowed in practice.
</p>

<p>
	In the meantime, we have to work within the bounds of what people can handle. We can't reform society too quickly or it will backfire.
</p>

<p>
	It would be nice to have some objective ways of adjudicating public policy issues. Because right now it's just people spouting their opinions without any concern for what the effects of the policy are. For example, tax cuts are made without no concern about how they impact society or if the economy is actually made better or worse by them. We need a definitive answer as to which tax rate leads to highest consciousness. This is a scientific question, not an ideological one. If the optimal tax rate turns out to be 90%, that's what we should make it. If it turns out to be 10%, then that. The point is not to get attached to any specific policy but rather focus on maximizing consciousness for the majority of people. Whatever helps to push us in that direction is what we should all agree on.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in practice there will be tons of resistance, since people are selfish devils. But in the long-run higher consciousness always wins out.
</p>

<p>
	I am not suggesting we scientifically test entire ideologies. That's doesn't seem possible. Ideologies are not empirical by design. But what we can scientifically test is very narrow concrete policy proposals such as:
</p>

<p>
	A) End the drug war for 10 years, monitor social stats to see if crime rate and other indicators rises or falls.
</p>

<p>
	B) Restart the drug war for 10 years, monitor social stats to see if crime rate and other indicators rises of falls.
</p>

<p>
	Then pick the best one.
</p>

<p>
	My best guess is that option A would be much better than option B. But we don't know that for sure. We need to run a test and see. There may be unforeseen problems with ending the drug war. For example, maybe too many teens start doing heroin and we have massive overdose deaths.
</p>

<p>
	Countries could also run different tests at the same time and pool their results. So, for example, the UK could run this drug war test for 20 years while the USA is testing something else. Then we look at their results and use it to help shape our next policy choices. This would be the intelligent way to go about it. In this way we could crowd-source the evolution of government very quickly. Imagine 100 countries running such tests for 100 years! The end result would be a really smart and efficient government. Of course our currently government is nowhere smart enough to adopt such an approach. But one day it will be.
</p>

<p>
	The structure of the best government for maximizing consciousness is really a structural engineering problem. Some designs will be much better than others. The problem is that no one really knows what the best design is. This requires an evolutionary process to discover. Just like designing the best rocket.
</p>

<p>
	What we should all be able to ultimately agree upon is that maximizing consciousness and love is best for all life forms overall. Of course it would be bad for selfish unconscious devils, so they will be the ones who will try to stick a wrench in the works.
</p>

The elephant is the same, but each photograph can be quite different.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not a question of which photograph is true vs false. They all contain some part of the truth. Some photographs are more revealing than others. You would not understand much of what an elephant is if I showed you a photo 2 inches from its ass.

	I will smoke it at some point just for testing purposes, but I'm perfectly satisfied with plugging. The dose can be increase to any potency you can handle. Weakness of trips is not an issue for me. My trips are about as strong as I want them. Anything more would start to get problematic and potentially dangerous. The last trip I took was insanely powerful. Most people would freak out on a trip such as that. It's such a profound mindfuck I cannot even put it into words. Just when I think I've got all the mindfuck there could be, there's more.

</p>

<p>
	I like the metaphor of jailbreaking a smartphone. If you've ever tried to jailbreak it, the phone has anti-jailbreaking software which tries to block you from jailbreaking it. That's exactly how your mind is. Your mind has anti-jailbreaking mechanisms -- and they are way more sneaky and sophisticated than any iPhone. It takes a genius to break free.
</p>

<p>
	How do you jailbreak your own mind?
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this is a common problem. Tier 1 thinkers tend to be too simplistic and one-dimensional. They don't see systemic problems. That requires Tier 2 Yellow cognition. And even then it's tricky. We have to admit that we don't always know how complex systems will behave. Which is why a scientific approach to public policy is so important. We need to split test solutions and track actual results.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine the following approach:
</p>

<p>
	Democrats propose change A to the education system.
</p>

<p>
	Republicans propose change B to the education system.
</p>

<p>
	A coin is tossed to see which change we split test first. We try it out for 10 years and we track the results with a non-partisan committee of scientists. Then we implement the other change and track those results for 10 years. Then at the 20 years mark we look at the data and select whichever produced the best results. Citizens could also be allowed to vote on which produced the best results. Once this process is complete we settle the issue forever and move on to other issues.
</p>

<p>
	In this way we don't keep rehashing issues like abortion rights, taxes, marijuana, immigration, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Of course partisan & ideological people will not want to agree to such a system because their ideology does not want to be tested in the court of real-world experience. That's the whole point of an ideology. It's held true come-what-may.
</p>

	My contribution is to make people aware of the problems and the solutions. To get them thinking properly. To install the proper mind OS. That's how philosophers and intellectuals contribute to advances in government.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I'm not gonna run for office. That's not my role. My role is intellectual, visionary, and inspirational.
</p>

<p>
	I would not make a good politician. I've said too many crazy things and I'm not really a people person.

<p>
	The real problems are systemic and much bigger picture than that.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some basic problems:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Improving education to make it more conscious
	</li>
	<li>
		Reducing waste on military-industrial complex
	</li>
	<li>
		Making it easier for all people to vote without discrimination
	</li>
	<li>
		Eliminating corporate lobbying and money corrupting politics
	</li>
	<li>
		Retraining the police so they don't shoot unarmed black folks
	</li>
	<li>
		Protecting the environment from destruction and toxic pollution
	</li>
	<li>
		Ending the drug war and for-profit prison system
	</li>
	<li>
		Regulating the banks so they don't crash the economy
	</li>
	<li>
		Regulating giant monopolistic companies like Amazon from dominating everyone else
	</li>
	<li>
		Making medical care affordable for everyone
	</li>
	<li>
		Making college affordable for everyone without massive debt
	</li>
	<li>
		Redistributing wealth so we have a thriving middle class, not a handful of billionaires
	</li>
	<li>
		Putting workers on all the boards of major corporations
	</li>
	<li>
		Helping young teens find their life purposes & train them for passion jobs
	</li>
	<li>
		Helping train people to start small businesses & giving them funding
	</li>
	<li>
		Funding for scientific & medical research
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving basic infrastructure like road, bridges, airports, schools
	</li>
	<li>
		Massive push for green energy
	</li>
	<li>
		Allowing people to vote for directly on propositions at the federal level the way they can at the state level
	</li>
	<li>
		Public funding of all elections
	</li>
	<li>
		Strengthening people's ability to unionize
	</li>
	<li>
		Regulating the giant telcoms
	</li>
	<li>
		Giving Constitutional protections to whistlerblowers like Ed Snowden
	</li>
	<li>
		Increasing government transparency across the board
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Stuff like that
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that we're trying to structure society in a way which enables more people to meet their basic needs and pursue higher consciousness without a lot of obstacles. How should society be restructured to facilitate that? How do we get as many people up the Spiral as fast as possible?
</p>

<p>
	See, most people don't even understand that the goal of government should be CONSCIOUSNESS! If we could just get people to realize that, half our problems would be solved. But of course they will NOT agree! They will resist. Because most people's goal is to use government for advancing their own egoic agenda. That's when the shitstorm ensues.
</p>

If you just spend a little time checking out her content on youtube you can clearly see that she has psychological issues, she spent 13 years in an abusive cult before she escaped. You don't just leave a cult like that and have no issues, There are lots of allegations against her. If you just spend a small bit time doing research on her you can see she is a Fake. she has all the spiritual lingo to impress but she probably learned all of this when she was in her cult. She might not have Cult yet but its heading that way or maybe its already happening. These Types of Fake spiritual teachers are very dangerous because they can confuse people and lead them off the path and can cause a lot of damage.

	I have spent enough time listening to libertarians debating their talking points to the point where I don't feel I need to hear any more. I got it.
</p>

<p>
	But if you haven't, sure, it might be worthwhile to do so just to see how foolish it is.
</p>

<p>
	While you're at it you can study Nazi ideology, Communist ideology, alt-right ideology, and many more. There is value in studying foolish philosophies. But at some point you gotta let it all go because there's bigger fish to fry and real work to do, and life is short.

	It's just that once you're aware of enough things, you quickly sort the wheat from the chaff and don't waste your time entertaining silly things.
</p>

<p>
	There are too many foolish ideologies in the world to debate them all seriously.
</p>

<p>
	You are welcome to believe whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	My interest is in talking about conscious politics, which is at a completely different level than typical political discussions. But it is not neutral and it does not tolerate nonsense or devilry.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, people expect consciousness to be neutral towards their foolishness and devliry. But it isn't. Consciousness shreds through bullshit. So if your position has bullshit it in it, you may feel like you're being treated unfairly.
</p>

<p>
	I don't have all the answers, but I have better answers than libertarians, that's for sure.

<p>
	Just one look at how foolish libertarian presidential candidates here in the US are tells you all you need to know. You can their videos on their conventions on Youtube. It's good for a night of laughs.

<p>
	I once spent 12 hours straight binge-watching libertarian videos through the whole night until 6 in the morning. It was so funny it was like 12 hours of the best comedy I've ever watched.

You can pick any random mantra and use it to meditate.
</p>

<p>
	Here, I'll give you a free mantra you can use which will be as good as any other:
</p>

<p>
	"rum lum da, rum lum da"
</p>

<p>
	There you go! Now repeat it mindfully a million times. That's all mantra meditation is.
</p>

<p>
	You will get better results with Kriya yoga and it's free.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's not entirely correct.
</p>

<p>
	Goodness beats out badness. Badness only arises when one isn't conscious enough and resists.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not just random. As you become more God-like and pure, the bad trips will become less and less frequent.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's important not to overdose or trip in the wrong settings. Taking 10 grams of mushrooms at a noisy music festival is a recipe for hell.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to trip is with small and moderate doses. Until you're very comfortable there.
</p>

<p>
	I have a feeling that 90% of all problematic trips could be eliminated simply by dosing lower and sitting in a quiet safe space free of people.
</p>

<p>
	Simply do not take high doses of anything. It's stupid and it will not grow you as much. Only take what you can handle.
</p>

<p>
	1-2g of mushrooms or 125ug of LSD is plenty for most people. Spend a couple of years working those doses and getting all the growth you can from them.
</p>

<p>
	People who take 5g of mushrooms or 400ug of LSD are being foolish. So of course they end up getting wrecked.
</p>

			I don't think you understand the philosophy behind libertarianism. Otherwise it would be blatantly obvious for any integral thinker to see the importance of implementing libertarian principles in good government
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Good government already assumes protections for individual liberties. You speak as if government is some kind of totalitarian enterprise. That's not good government at all.
</p>

<p>
	Good government delicately balances between individualism vs collectivism & freedom vs limitation. It does not take ideological or absolutist stances on either side.
</p>

<p>
	Individual liberties are only possible through mutually agreed upon and self-imposed limitations. For example, you are not free to own a nuclear weapon because if such a liberty were allowed then all humans would be dead, thus ending all liberties for everyone. You are also not free to discharge a firearm in an airplane for obvious reasons.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with the libertarian philosophy is that: A) it is purely a philosophy and disconnected from real life, and B) it is an ideological position of freedom absolutism. Absolutist positions do not work. They are a form of fundamentalism. Here you have a case of free market fundamentalism. So libertarianism is actually a kind of religion with all of the problems religions creates, just in a secular vein. If you notice the way in which libertarians defend themselves, it's very similar to how radical Muslims defend themselves. The mental gymnastics are similar.
</p>

You just gotta take them in stride and keep your eye on the ball -- your larger vision. Why can't you run your business from another location? Why can't you follow the code?
</p>

<p>
	This is an opportunity for you to take your business to the next level, make it more professional.
</p>

<p>
	Your anxiety is understandable, but it's also clouding your vision, so don't stew in it for too long.
</p>

<p>
	If you build your business properly it should not be so fragile to be tanked by one code violation.
</p>

<p>
	Even if this business ends up failing, remember, that's just valuable experience for building your next, even better business. So hang in there. When it becomes to business you gotta be persistent like a python strangling its prey.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, life will get really hard at times.
</p>

<p>
	Have you considered renting a small office? They can be very affordable.
</p>

<p>
	It seems some people have a serious immunity to it. Like it just fails to work on them.
</p>

<p>
	Very odd. Hope you guys can figure out why that is.
</p>

<p>
	You might need to try smoking/vaping it.

</p>

<p>
	Give it a week, you'll feel better. Let it pass.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like you were shown some deep truths which you were not ready to stomach so you resisted it. That's all material which must be worked through. That IS the real spiritual path.
</p>

<p>
	Before you reach the rainbows and butterflies you must face your inner demons.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms are a twisted and mischievous substance. Might want to try something more straightforward next time like AL-LAD. And lower your doses.
</p>

<p>
	The deeper question is, why would you care to escape it? The way your question is framed it assumes that escape is better than not-escape. But this is only true if you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	God escapes itself, then it returns to itself. Since it has nowhere to go, since it is in all places at once. Liberation is to realize that there is nowhere to go, nowhere to escape because all places are equally good. So long as you think that one place or state is better than another, you will suffer and seek to change your state. To be liberated is to be surrendered to whatever state happens to arise, seeing the perfection of them all. If you try to cling to any one state, including formlessness, it becomes a problem.
</p>

<p>
	You can't escape the totality of what you are.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, obviously, since that's basically what enlightenment is.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to sit and concentrate on nothingness for many thousands of hours. Or do decades of yoga.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga is basically a method for naturally producing 5-MeO-DMT or its equivalent. Dark room retreats are another method. Long fasts are another method. Shamanic breathing is another method.
</p>

<p>
	All these techniques are designed to change your state of consciousness.
