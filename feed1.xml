<p>
	Sexual repression always creates a shadow.
</p>

<p>
	This is the problem with moralization. It can never substitute for personal dev work or spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	A classic stage Blue problem.

<p>
	It couldn't be any other way. No true happiness is possible without awakening, so you will never attain it so long as the ego is alive.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a mistake. This is by design.
</p>

<p>
	What you intuit is that you need awakening. Your intuition is correct but you don't yet realize just how correct it is.
</p>

<p>
	You've been playing a losing game your whole life and now you're starting to suspect its a rigged game.
</p>

<p>
	To expect happiness without awakening is madness.

</blockquote>

<p>
	How do you explain anything at all?
</p>

<p>
	This is the crux of the problem. You are assuming it can/should be explained without realizing that BEING is prior to explanation and is irreducibly mystical. This one of the core mistakes of science.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to stop explaining and to start BEING.
</p>

<p>
	Explanation is a finite, second order thing. The nature of reality is such that all explanations must be incomplete.
</p>

<p>
	You are trying to symbolize Truth, which is impossible because Truth is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	You can BE the Truth, but you cannot know it.
</p>

<p>
	You can try forcing an explanation (as science does) but if you do that it automatically becomes incomplete and relative, not the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Past and future are concepts occurring in the now.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that the ego-mind is trying to understand how/what the now is, and to do so, it creates concepts.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind is busy trying to demystify the now, but in fact, the now is mystical and it is a wrong move to try to demystify it. In an attempt to demystify it, ideas like past and future get created, which lead to a false understanding.
</p>

<p>
	So the counter-intuitive move to surrender to the fact that the now is literally magic, without a past or future.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that past and future are posited because otherwise the mind just cannot accept the raw truth that the now is here all by itself. That would be too eerie, too woo-woo for the ego-mind.
</p>

He can be surprisingly openminded.
</p>

<p>
	As for his fanbase, that's another matter. Lots of Sam Harris and JP worshiping going on there. Lots of materialism, lots of atheism, lots of rationalism, lots of libertarians, lots of do-you-even-lift testosterone bros.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, Joe has a very broad audience. It's just the loud-mouth trolls who yell the loudest.

</p>

<p>
	Every stage is supposed to build on top of the ones before it.
</p>

<p>
	Pathology occurs when a new stage emerges and tries to suppress the lower stages. Which, of course, every stage tries to do.
</p>

<p>
	The key evolutionary developments of stage Green are acknowledgement of relativism, the impulse towards universal equality, and environmental consciousness. These are all good things which are necessary to soften Orange's cut-throat individualism and blind materialistic ambition. This is a much needed solution to Orange chaos.
</p>

<p>
	Each stage creates it own kind of chaos which the next stage then evolves to resolve.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to Blue chaos was Orange. The solution Orange chaos is Green. The solution to Green chaos is Yellow.

<p>
	I do it late at night. But that's probably not ideal for most people. I can't do it in the morning because my nose gets clogged in the morning.
</p>

<p>
	Time is not the the issue, it's about doing the various sets, however long that takes. Earlier in this thread I gave you a few routine stacks, from newbie to advanced. They usually take 30m to 1h 20m, depending on how many sets you're doing.

<p>
	I stopped conventional meditation. I just do Kriya instead + I randomly just sit and look around the room whenever I feel like it.
</p>

<p>
	After a few months of Kriya your mind should naturally start to calm down and you should start to feel like you're naturally meditating whenever you take a moment to just sit and be quiet. Meditation also becomes much more enjoyable.
</p>

<p>
	After Kriya, my meditation has become much more organic, less forced and artificial. I meditate when I'm taking a piss, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Because the yoga rewires the brain stem. It's more of a hardware fix than a software fix. It's more like a psychedelic in this regard.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that's one of the problems with his whole system. Same with Sam Harris.
</p>

<p>
	For JP, that comes from his Blue traditionalist Christian values. Christianity is traditionally very moralistic, which is a classic case of shooting their followers in the foot.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like JP cannot accept the deeper truth that all morality is a human invention and that to be truly Good you must abandon all moral ideologies. A truly conscious person does not moralize because he's conscious that evil literally does not exist and that ALL is Good so there is nothing to moralize about. Moralization is something the ego does. And you can clearly see Peterson falling into this trap with respect to the post-modernism, socialism, and stage Green as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	A classic Christian, stage Blue, conservative trap.
</p>

<p>
	The very reason that JP is fighting against post-modernism is because stage Green's relativism undermines all transitional notions of good vs evil. Which is correct! Those notions are human inventions! But JP does not want to bite that bullet and pass through post-modern nihilism to more advanced stages of morality, which are based on consciousness, not human ideas of good vs evil. JP feels that to admit to relativity is to open Pandora's box of chaos. Stage Blue fears chaos (stage Red). Which is why the subtitle of his book literally expresses his fear:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But this fear must be surrendered to, not fought against. Stage Green is not chaos, it's just a new, higher kind of order.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue creates rules to keep itself from sliding into chaos. Stage Blue becomes the anal-retentive rulekeeper stereotype, which leads to all sorts of neuroses (which are well-hidden from public view through suppression).
</p>

<p>
	JP has created a public identity out of fighting against chaos. Which is precisely just his own shadow.
</p>

<p>
	The profound irony is that JP hasn't cleaned his own room. Which is why he's acting out in public.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is a tricky beast. Especially the mind of an intellectual.
</p>

<p>
	"The better the model, the bigger the problem."
</p>

<p>
	Everything that's happening to JP is predicted by Spiral Dynamics, if one would just bother to study it closely. When it comes to people's behaviors and ideological positions, there's little new under the sun. There's nothing original about how conservatives behave or think. It's very robotic. Predictable like clockwork. In fact, they pride themselves on that.
</p>

			Isn't nothing the lack of direct awareness you currently do not perceive. For example the space behind the wall is not in your awareness, so nothing is behind the wall. When you walk behind it, then the place you formerly stood on doesn't exist in your awareness hence it being nothing.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	Nothing cannot be imagined. You are trying to imagine it. That's not it.
</p>

<p>
	The wall IS Nothing.
</p>

<p>
	The mind will never get this. This requires a radically altered state of consciousness. Your consciousness must dilate open. A few thousand hours of intense mediation will do it. Or some psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Reasoning it out will never work, so you might as well give that up.

<p>
	Form just means every tangible object or experience.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you've experienced in your life, from a cat to a car to a house to an idea to an emotion, is form.
</p>

<p>
	And formlessness is...

		<p>
			I assume consciousness/awareness is also included in the list.

		<p>
			Moojis comment to your reply would be: "What sees the experience? Even that experience is seen."

		<p>
			He say that no matter how nice the experience is, it's not "it". There's always someone/something which sees the seer.
		</p>

		<p>
			What's your take on that..?
		</p>

		<p>
			Or maybe I have misunderstood something. Maybe Mooji say that to push people towards the "thing" you mentioned, so people don't stop too early. And that would be the end station so to speak, final destination.

<p>
	Yes, consciousness is Nothingness. Which is why you can't grasp hold of it.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is not an experience. It is Absolute and Mooji don't matter at that point. You are Mooji talking to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Mooji was pointing you to Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	I am not enlightned but I have seen the Absolute many times at this point from a variety of angles, deeper than some teachers.
</p>

<p>
	I have seen the Heart Sutra's truth for myself, and it is true as fuck. Realizing the Heart Sutra is what you want.

<p>
	The Heart Sutra says it perfectly.
</p>

<p>
	The only trouble is becoming so insanely conscious to see it.

<p>
	It's right there under your nose. Don't go looking elsewhere. You are inside Nothingness at all times.

<p>
	How could everything be distinct from nothing? Nothing is nothing, so there is nothing to keep it from fusing with everything.
</p>

<p>
	No, I have not redefined the word. I am trying to show you that the distinction between something and nothing is in fact relative.
</p>

<p>
	The universe actually cannot tell the difference between something and nothing.

<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			I think you guys are just bending the word 'nothing'. What's the point with that? Is the point that it's a cool thing to say "everything is nothing" and "you are nothing"?
		</p>

		<p>
			You change the word 'nothing' to a half-assed 'nothing'. Let the word mean really really really nothing instead of half-assed nothing.

<p>
	No, you are not hearing what is being said.
</p>

<p>
	These are not word games. Nothing actually is identical to everything.
</p>

<p>
	Do not expect to understand this using your rational linear mind. This requires a deep enlightenment to grasp. We talking about the ultimate structure of all of existence here! Don't except this to be easy or logical.
</p>

<p>
	All your ideas of nothing are not nothing.
</p>

<p>
	The closest you can get to nothing is by looking around the room. That is actual nothing.
</p>

<p>
	---------
</p>

<p>
	Just trust my guidance on this one guys. Otherwise you will waste years looking in the wrong direction.
</p>

<p>
	I am pointing you straight at nothing. But it's extremely radically and the mind doesn't want to see it.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic to speed up the realization. This one's a doozy and will take you 20 years to realize sober.

<p>
	Something didn't emerge out of nothing. Rather, something and nothing are identical and indistinguishable.
</p>

<p>
	0 vs 1 is a distinction or a difference you're latching onto.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possibility that there is no difference between 0 and 1. Or in other words, there is only a difference between 0 and 1 if you say that there is, otherwise there isn't.
</p>

<p>
	Pause, look around the room, and notice that everything you see is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire life has been nothing, only you had mistaken it for something.
</p>

<p>
	All this time your mistake has been thinking that everything around you is something when it is in fact nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing looks precisely like the "physical universe". Nothing is NOT an empty hole like you have always imagined.

<p>
	"Physical" itself is a hollow, relative term. Really contemplate: What does "physical" even mean?
</p>

<p>
	Physical vs non-physical is a conceptual distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Even real vs unreal is a conceptual distinction.
</p>

<p>
	All distinctions are relative, and not the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	But it gets even weirder!
</p>

<p>
	Even the distinction between relative vs absolute is itself a conceptual distinction! Such that there can be no difference between something and nothing, form and formlessness, reality and illusion, enlightenment and non-enlightenment.

			Is there no possible way that there could have been a physical universe? In another reality perhaps let's say...

			I know this Current reality / existence is ALL THERE IS. nothing is outside of it. I'm just saying, is this the only way it could have been?

<p>
	This shows that you do NOT know what "ALL THERE IS" really means.
</p>

<p>
	ALL THERE IS....
</p>

<p>
	Think about that. That's everything!
</p>

<p>
	So what the hell are you talking about? What is more than ALL?
</p>

<p>
	ALL is an absolute. "More" is a relative term which does not apply to the ALL.
</p>

<p>
	ALL includes all other realities already.
</p>

<p>
	If you can think of something beyond the ALL, then your notion of the ALL wasn't actually the ALL.

<p>
	Tone is the least of JP problems.
</p>

<p>
	The deep structural issue is that he is programming his fans with stage Blue mentality, against Green. It stifles movement up the Spiral, which is what's necessary for people to find God. So he's shooting his own fans in the foot.

	If someone hits a castle made out of Legos with a hammer, the castle will break. So will your sense of self & life.
</p>

<p>
	What remains is no-self.
</p>

<p>
	You only exist as an idea. This idea will die and all that will remain is the universe.
</p>

<p>
	With a broken brain, you will not longer to able to say or think, "This is my life". And thus "you" will cease to exist as an ego. Sights, sounds, and feelings could still arise, but there would be nothing claiming ownership of them.
</p>

<p>
	No-self = True Self
</p>

<p>
	Where you go is, you die.
</p>

<p>
	You only exist now as an idea.
</p>

Consciousness is the only thing that you've ever encountered or can encounter. The rest is a conceptual framework you've invented within your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	"Physical objects" is a concept within consciousness. Take a look at what that really is.
</p>

<p>
	"But maybe there is still the possibility that reality can be physical" << that's a concept within consciousness!
</p>

<p>
	To discover that the materialist paradigm is wrong you must closely examine what "physical", "material", and "matter" really are in your direct experience. You must discover that they are concepts.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics also help a lot in this deconstruction.
</p>

<p>
	None of this is a matter of belief. You must sit down and ACTUALLY look at what is real in your direct experience. This is called contemplation or self-inquiry. The answers are inside you, if you would just bother to look. Don't look for arguments, look at what is ACTUALLY the case in your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is an illusion of course and nothing has any meaning already.
</p>

<p>
	The universe will never end though, it will just turn into a unity and fragment back into infinite multiplicity.
</p>

<p>
	Fun idea to contemplate: the beginning of the Big Bang and the end, heat death, are actually identical because you cannot distinguish them.
</p>

<p>
	Space and time are illusory human inventions. You can become conscious that they don't actually exist.

</p>

<p>
	God is precisely not a map or a meaning.
</p>

<p>
	Peterson's work is what keeps him from discovering God.
</p>

<p>
	His intuition is right that God is worth seeking. But he does not understand how to realize God because he's stuck in orthodox Christian notions of God, which are extremely misleading.
</p>

<p>
	And then his silly politics stems from that.
</p>

<p>
	Sit down and have an honest conversation with her about your intentions towards her. Tell her you like her a lot, but that you don't feel she's "the one". You can suggest that you could still keep seeing each other, if she still wants. But now she will know how you feel and she will have more realistic expectations.
</p>

<p>
	It will be heartbreaking for her, but it will better than stringing her along. And ultimately she should understand.
</p>

<p>
	The key thing is that you aren't leading her on with false expectations.

<p>
	Having sex outdoors in public is pretty hard and scary. Not to mention if this is your first time ever having sex.
</p>

<p>
	You should be much more comfortable in a secure indoor environment where you will not be interrupted or have to rush.
</p>

<p>
	Logistics, logistics, logistics. 70% of getting laid is planning out the night properly so that you two end up alone in a secure location.
</p>

<p>
	Also, do not get overly sexual with a girl unless you are ALREADY in a secure location. You must close the deal, otherwise she will often get too creeped out by the situation and not give you another shot. It's too awkward to get naked with someone but not have sex. And girls hate that kind of awkwardness.
</p>

<p>
	Next time, make sure you close. You, as the man, are responsible for planning things such that you can close.
</p>

You can find such people on online pickup forums.
</p>

<p>
	Approaching is one of those things which feels very difficult at first, but is actually a lot easier than your mind makes it out to be.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to learn to approach solo. It helps a lot to a few seasoned wing-men.
</p>

<p>
	You also need to find the right locations to do your approaching (mall, nightclub, cafe, etc). Some locations are much better than others.

<p>
	Yes, but he also drank quite a bit of ayahausca.
</p>

<p>
	I've discussed this issue with him in private at length. His consciousness of nonduality seems legit. As in: permanent nondual awareness.
</p>

<p>
	But he admits, and I agree, that his awakening was rather unusual and unique to him. Not a typical result.

<p>
	P.S. If you work on making yourself a great man, she will never want to leave you. In fact, being less possessive of her will make her love you more.
</p>

<p>
	It's like reverse psychology.
</p>

<p>
	If you are a weak man who isn't working on improving himself, then yes, she might leave you from something more exciting.
</p>

<p>
	She doesn't really want another girl, she wants more passion, excitement, adventure. So give her more of that. You want that too.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of a relationship is to grow and explore together. That's what keeps it from getting stale.

			<span>In your video about PUA you suggest to find a more authentic and non-technical approach to dating. So is it ok to learn the process of dating as you suggest in the quote? Or is it inauthentic and deceitful?</span>

<p>
	You can learn all the techniques and psychology behind attraction and relationships. That is not a problem. In fact, it's very important and women will ultimately appreciate it.
</p>

<p>
	The problem arises when you start to turn all of that into an ideology and identity, the way PUA culture does. Don't become that alpha-bro manwhore who runs around chasing women all the time and bragging about it.
</p>

<p>
	Attract women, but above all, be a good kind man. Don't become a manipulative used dick salesmen. Learn to develop deep relationships with those women you attract. Don't do it for the sex or the ego, do it for the growth opportunities.
</p>

<p>
	This is just the nature of online forums.
</p>

<p>
	98% of forum posts are supposed to be nonsense. The other 2% are the gold which makes wading through the 98% worthwhile.
</p>

<p>
	You just have to adjust your expectations for what forums are. A public forum is not an encyclopedia. If you want that, you got Wikipedia (which is awesome by the way).

<p>
	Everything is a hallucination at all times.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can delude yourself into believing all sorts of things using any kind of methods, so it's a rather moot point.
</p>

<p>
	It would be a delusion to assume that psychedelics increase your chances of delusion. You are at max delusion "sober". But, yes, you can still be deluded under psychedelics.

			I have the same problem, and I cannot wrap my mind around it either.
		</p>

		<p>
			Let's assume the materialist position, that an outside world exists and that a brain is generating consciousness:
		</p>

		<p>
			If that is true, every idea I have, every impression of reality I have, is nothing but an illusion created by the brain. Though the problem here is that this illusion includes all impressions and ideas of the brain I have as well! Everything I believe about reality is nothing but a belief, that is the very problem! If I believe that a brain exists, what exactly is happening? I have a thought of a brain, and that thought included that the thought of the brain is created by the brain. That means the thought of the brain cannot be the brain, no matter what thought I will have! Your mind should be absolutely blown at this point, but let's continue. If my thought about the brain is not the brain itself then what the hell is the brain? Any thought I will ever have about the brain can impossibly be the brain. By definition the brain is creating the ideas, so how could the ideas be the same as the brain?
		</p>

		<p>
			It gets even worse! The brain is made of atoms, but atoms are nothing but an idea in my head as well! If atoms are what is creating my experience, then clearly the idea of atoms that I have are not the atoms, because the atoms are what is generating the idea! What is going on?!
		</p>

		<p>
			It goes further:
		</p>

		<p>
			Every idea I have about anything is happening in my consciousness, right? It's also true that any experience I have at all is happening in my consciousness as well! But my ideas about consciousness and experiences itself are experiences and ideas themselves! They clearly are not consciousness, but how is it possible that I can even have a thought about consciousness? Why can I think about anything, and what does thinking about anything even mean?
		</p>

		<p>
			At this point I am utterly confused. It seems like it's the limit of the mind, but the problem is that the limit of the mind is just another idea in the mind! This goes on and on!
		</p>

		<p>
			It's like I am generating a fatal error in my own programming. Can you see it too?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes! Very good!
</p>

<p>
	What you are starting to catch onto there is that everything you call reality is a conceptual fabrication. If you keep questioning deeper you will evetually realize that "physical reality" itself is just an idea, "my birth" is also just an idea, "my life" is also just an idea, "other people" is also just an idea. At which point reality will collapse and you die. That is awakening.
</p>

<p>
	After you peel back every layer of the onion what you will discover at the very center is Emptiness. That's the True Self.
</p>

			Perhaps, although what I think I am saying is that you are also within the drean using a substance that is a also in the dream (and therefore by your logic cannot be true).  Basically from within the dream you think you exited the dream but you have not.  btw other people have taken 5MEO and reported back on this very site with different experiences from yours.  So who's right?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The difference is I have ACTUALLY exited the dream and become the Absolute. You have not. So you are wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this may seem arrogant to you, but nevertheless, it is true. And there is no way you will know if I am right until you yourself awaken. At which point you will clearly know the Absolute Truth, but you will be unable to communicate it to anyone else, and you find yourself precisely in my shoes, trying to explain awakening to the unawakened, who just cannot get it because they deeply underestimate what reality is.

<p>
	All knowledge is non-trivial, involving serious risk and investment of resources. Which is why science takes hundreds of years to make progress, with many dead ends.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why you must choose how you invest your time very very wisely.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately you seem to lack that wisdom, which is a rather problematic catch-22.
</p>

<p>
	How do you convince a thirsty donkey to drink water if he keeps insisting the water is poison?
</p>

<p>
	And so the donkey, thinking he has avoided a great danger, will end up dying of thirst.

	Any ideas you have about 5-MeO are wrong. It's just that simple.

<p>
	And you never will. That's the point.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is not capable of getting this because it is the cause of the dream.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot speculate about spirituality. You must do the practices, whether than be 5-MeO or yoga or meditation, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to overcome a lack of direct experience with thinking. You see that?

	You keep making your misuse of skepticism about me. This issue has nothing to do with yoga or with me. It has to do with how you are misusing your mind, and then expecting others to prove things to you. This not how to seek truth.

<p>
	Leave Leo out of the conversation. Leo should not even enter your mind as you go about seeking truth. What I believe is totally irrelevant. What matters is that you start to contemplate and self-reflect about your own behaviors and beliefs.

	Believing me will advance you to truth. You must discover the validity of the guidance being given to you for yourself, through self-reflection and experimentation.

<p>
	No.
</p>

<p>
	You were given a far deeper lesson here. You were shown the limits of the Orange paradigm, but you insist on continuing to see the world from that level.
</p>

<p>
	You are being taught to open your mind.
</p>

<p>
	When you finally open your mind, you will stop demanding that people prove anything to you.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that your entire attitude is anti-scientific. True science is not about demanding proofs from people. True science is about openminded experimentation.

<title>It makes no sense to earn money/make a living</title>

<p>
	It's very important to figure out how you are going to offer value to the world.
</p>

<p>
	Your mistake is thinking of this as "work" or "making money". That's super shallow. You need to think of it as: "What is my art? What do I want to contribute to mankind?" The money follows from your passion.
</p>

<p>
	You will have to make a living in the world no matter what, so might as well do it on your terms.
</p>

<p>
	I make a living by doing what I love most. This was by deep design, not luck.
</p>

<p>
	You are inside a dream. All of your ideas about reality are fantasies inside this dream. Science and reason are fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Every objection or thought you have is fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Anything you type on that keyboard is fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Any ideas you have about 5-MeO are fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot escape this dream by thinking. Nor can you imagine what lies outside the dream.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO takes you out of the dream. You will not understand how it is possible, but it is.

<p>
	See video: True vs False Skepticism
</p>

<p>
	You so called "skeptics" are simply letting ego weaponize skepticism.
</p>

<p>
	Skepticism is great when done right. But in the hands of a fool, skepticism turns into an ideology and leads to stupidities like Flat Earthers, scientism, materialism, atheism, reductionism, behaviorism, logical positivism, rationalism, libertarianism, etc. Which is what is happening in this thread.
</p>

<p>
	Apply skepticism internally, to yourself, not externally at other people.
</p>

<p>
	Self-deception 101.
</p>

<p>
	You have been told precisely the fallacy in your approach, but you refuse to hear it.
</p>

<p>
	A person stuck in stage Orange will not be able to do yoga. The mind is just too locked into the materialist paradigm. Your level of development is too low. Try doing more ordinary self help for a few years. Then revisit the issue.
</p>

<p>
	Very few people are ready to learn what Actualized.org videos are teaching. This is not some shallow Jordan Peterson or Tony Robbins self-improvement. We are talking about the deconstruction of physical reality here. And your mind will not allow you to do that easily. You will have to work through many layers of self-deception mechanisims first. Of which skepticism is but one.
</p>

	No one is asking you to believe anything. You are being told to run a serious experiment.

<p>
	Yoga is an extremely advanced spiritual practice. It is not for closedminded stage Orange fools.

</p>

<p>
	Without consumerism, how would you get your food, clothes, electronics?
</p>

<p>
	Notice that Green depends on Orange foundations.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how you yourself had to grow through Orange. So how can you judge others for doing the same? It would be like judging a child for not being an adult.

<p>
	Yes and no.
</p>

<p>
	You can have multiple enlightenments, each one going deeper.
</p>

<p>
	It's a complex topic. There many facets of reality to become conscious of even though all of those facets ultimately unite into one. It's like you are groping an elephant in a dark room. You're groping it piece by piece. Then sometimes the lights turn on in the whole room for 1 second and you glimpse the entire thing. But it's still worthwhile to go back and grope the tail or the ear individually because there's a lot of nuance in each piece which you didn't get during that 1 second glimpse.
</p>

<p>
	And after lots of doing that, maybe at some point you will get to a stage where you can clearly see the whole elephant in its full glory.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is a self-negating self-negation.

<p>
	God is that.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to figure this out using the mind. It will not work. It is profoundly paradoxically. The mind cannot handle it.

<p>
	Psychedelics and/or yoga is the way to go about realizing this.

That's exactly correct. All experiences are in fact eternal. They have existed FOREVER. This very sentence you are reading has existed within Absolute Infinity for eternity. The mind is just overlooking this oh-so-obvious fact.
</p>

<p>
	Right now, look around the room you're in. You are looking at eternity in the flesh.

Say if you became hella enlightened right now(like for example Eckhart Tolle) how important would it be to do personal development? I feel like you would grow hugely from the enlightenment. And then the need for books wouldn’t really be a thing? Is studying personal development literature important?(say standard self help like tony Robbins, or maybe some sort of stage green or yellow self help?) or would you not need that since you are beyond all that? You have outgrown it all after you integrated the enlightenment? Maybe you have gone up to turqoise within a couple years? What is the importance of literature on personal development when you have a radical enlightenment? I’m just trying to get a big picture here.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It would still be important. Of course having a massive enlightenment will itself produce a huge shift in your development. But that will not be enough by itself. There will still be many things which you are unconscious of and many ways to improve your life. Your bad habits and shadow side will still largely remain unaddressed. You will still lack important skills and knowledge for succeeding in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment will not automatically put you at Turquoise. Turquoise requires additional work. Being a good human being also requires additional work. Fully embodying your enlightenment requires additional work. Becoming a good teacher requires additional work. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	And having one complete massive life-shattering enlightened is extremely rare. Chances are high you will fall back asleep after your first glimpse, or have some kind of ego-backlash.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, consciousness is basically the same as hyper-lucidity. You become so lucid you realize there is no difference between difference and sameness. You become conscious that the metaphysical distinctions underlying your entire sense of reality are all meaningless: self vs world, life vs death, real vs unreal, something vs nothing. All of these distinctions collapse and you are left in pure nonduality. Reality becomes indistinct. Your identity collapses to zero and expands to infinity simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
	At this level of lucidity, life as you know it is over. You have awoken from "life". You realize that your entire "life" was just a dream. You have died and awoken to realize that death is impossible because you are God. You are suspended in an infinite eternal state of Nirvana. You have achieved actual immortality. You realize that your true identity is an infinity singularity, which includes inside it every living creature that has ever existed or will exist. You are so lucid that you have 100% omniscient understanding of all of reality. You realize that you have created yourself using infinite intelligence and that nothing exists but yourself.
</p>

<p>
	This degree of consciousness cannot be imagined or believed. It is extremely radical. It defies all scientific or rational explanation.
</p>

<p>
	Real vs unreal is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality = all distinctions collapse into a unity. At this ultimate, Absolute level of consciousness, there is literally no difference between anything. There is not even a difference between real and unreal.
</p>

<p>
	Practically, you should make a distinction in your mind between level of consciousness vs level of development.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment work is about raising your level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Personal development is about raising your level of development and changing your life around.
</p>

<p>
	Both are very important.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity has no opposite. It is total. It already includes an infinite number of other realities.
</p>

<p>
	There is no "more" than Absolute Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Like so:

<p>
	Anything you can think of (and everything you can't) is already accounted for by Absolute Infinity.

<p>
	If this was strictly true, no human being could ever have become enlightened ever.
</p>

<p>
	But your point is valid practically-speaking for the vast majority of seekers.
</p>

<p>
	Hardcore seekers can accomplish enlightenment without any tutelage or theory. But if you are on this forum or watching my videos, that ain't you.

</p>

<p>
	That video is a nice attempt, but that approach will always fail.
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to have a scientific theory of everything because a theory is precisely not everything, and neither is science.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not a code or a language or an equation or a model of any kind.
</p>

<p>
	The only proper theory of everything is: Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	But that's not a theory. That's actual everything (and nothing) <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Any attempt to capture the Truth in symbols will always fail. The Truth cannot fit into any kind of box because the box itself is an infinitely small part of the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	What science is trying to do can only be achieved through spirituality. And it was already achieved 5000 years ago. The problem is, people still don't get it.
