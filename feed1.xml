<title>Is bitcoin Stage Orange?</title>

In that sense, Bitcoin could become a Green technology.
</p>

<p>
	But there is also a lot of currency manipulation and gambling that goes on with BItcoin. People mining for Bitcoin hoping become overnight millionaires. That is a very Orange phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	Bitcoin is similar to the internet as a whole: it has a huge democratizing influence, but with this democratization comes all kind of vulgarity, manipulation, and nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	On the one hand the internet gave us Wikipedia, on the other hand it gave us porn and 4chan. Technology almost always tends to be a mixed bag, requiring nuanced sorting of wheat from chaff and wise application.
</p>

<p>
	In the hands of a fool, any tool become dangerous. And every stage of the Spiral will try to use new technology to entrench and defend itself.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue terrorists will not hesitate to use stage Orange nuclear weapons if they can get their hands on them.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I find this statement rather absurd for a scientist to say.
</p>

<p>
	Mankind has ALWAYS been in denial about science/reality, including scientists themselves!
</p>

<p>
	Scientists themselves deny all new radical scientific discoveries.
</p>

<p>
	Perfect example of Orange's lack of epistemic nuance.

And not just on the cushion. They read and study scriptures too. And they learn from teaching.
</p>

<p>
	You're not just going to awaken in one fell swoop out of the blue and have life mastered.
</p>

<p>
	The process is both gradual and sudden.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual schools exist precisely because there is much to learn.

<p>
	To you it seems as though they aren't turned on by it because they follow your lead. So if all you lead them towards is shallow Orange sex, that's all they accept without even knowing what they're missing. And you cannot lead a woman to Green sex unless you are first comfortable being there yourself. When you give a woman Green sex, she will love you forever.

<p>
	I haven't really watched it, but Dr Phil feels Green to me.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all mainstream self-help shows are heavily monetized with an Orange biz model and place a strong emphasis on Orange achievement advice because that's what sells and what people crave.
</p>

<p>
	So even if Dr Phil himself is Green, the corporate execs running his show probably push him to go Orange a lot.

<p>
	Looks like a good primer.
</p>

<p>
	Watch my Derrida episode after you're done with this.
</p>

<p>
	I get the sense that most people still haven't understood the significance of what was said in the Derrida episode.
</p>

<p>
	And I have a really great book about Derrida in my book list. Highly recommend it if you want to understand post-modernism properly. And it's any easy and fun read! (Which is very rare for Derrida books.)

<title>Coming off social media for Green?</title>

<p>
	It's not that you cannot be Green within ditching social media. But if you're on social media, it will keep you from connecting with Being and nature and people.
</p>

<p>
	The very fact that you are afraid to leave social media because it is integral to your business/career is a huge sign that Orange has you by the balls. You are prioritizing success over other things and you're addicted to it.
</p>

<p>
	No one is saying you should never use social media. We're giving you suggestions for how to evolve to higher levels of consciousness. In the same way that you might tell a fat person to stop sitting on the couch. This does not mean you need to throw your couch into the dumpster and sit on a bed of nails.

<p>
	Disowning reality does not work.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of Spiral Dynamics is to help you OWN every stage. That can only happen when you understand that every stage is necessary to the functioning of the whole.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, even Nazi's are necessary. OWN it.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is you.

<p>
	Cause most people on YT and in the West are Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Of course many Green people watch me too.
</p>

<p>
	Fully overcoming Orange isn't easy cause it's the predominant culture of our time. Even much of personal dev is Orange.
</p>

<p>
	As my channel evolved over the last year or two, I've probably alienated many solid Orange people with my mystical talk. So maybe now I have more Green people. Who can say? The majority of viewers stay silent. The wisest, most Yellow viewers probably don't ever post a comment, which skews my understanding of my audience.

<p>
	He seems genuine, but you never really know with celebrities. What you see on TV is a sliver of their entire lives. And as an ex-addict, it's easy to backslide.

	He manages to run circles around conventionally-minded Orange/Green people, which is just delicious:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">

	</div>
</div>

<p>
	He's a really great example of social and emotional IQ, rather than logical IQ.
</p>

<p>
	That's what post-rationalism looks like.

	Seems very typical Orange to me. Don't underestimate how douchey and heartless Orange can be. That's standard Wallstreet mentality.

<p>
	Every color on the Spiral has its own version of political correctness:
</p>

<p>
	Blue PC = banning vulgarity, sex, porn, blasphemy, banning criticism of the church/civilization
</p>

<p>
	Orange PC = banning criticism of the evils of corporations
</p>

<p>
	Green PC = banning racist speech, hate speech, cruel speech, banning criticism of Green
</p>

<p>
	If you criticize Islam in Blue Saudi Arabia, they will kill you.
</p>

<p>
	If you expose the evils of factory farming in Orange America, they will sue you.
</p>

<p>
	If you call someone a racial slur in a Green organization, they will fire you.

I also think to accept  and tolerate the views of others makes green seem like a doormat and to Submit to a group or community is to be a sheep. Its also unsettling to learn that sjw snowflakes are actually more developed than me.

<p>
	Right, that's pretty much what I suspected.
</p>

<p>
	So what that tells me is, you're a typical young male in stage Orange who is still evolving and will eventually mature into Green.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing abnormal here. You have been very thoroughly conditioned by our heavily Orange culture.
</p>

<p>
	"Emotions as a weakness" is a very common idea these days with young men. It's part of Orange culture and trying to find your male identity. But as you mature as a male, you will soften and you will see the power of emotions.
</p>

<p>
	In your 20's, you still haven't found yourself as a persona. (Never mind enlightenment.) So one of the ways young males go about finding themselves is striving to fit the "alpha" ideal. Which requires a denial of emotions, femininity, softness, vulnerability, crying, caring, empathy, community, cooperation, love, relationship, etc.

<title>Recent Uptick In Trolling</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<p>
	We've been having an uptick in trolling and personal sniping on this forum recently, and I'm getting sick of reading it.
</p>

<p>
	This is a warning to all trolls: stop, or you will be banned.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Stop sniping at other members
	</li>
	<li>
		Stop creating purposefully inflammatory topics
	</li>
	<li>
		Stop defending and justifying yourself
	</li>
	<li>
		Stop acting like a jerk
	</li>
	<li>
		Stop acting like a cocky know-it-all
	</li>
	<li>
		Stop purposefully contradicting other members just to provoke them
	</li>
	<li>
		Stop speculating about things
	</li>
	<li>
		Stop blaming others for trolling or provoking you
	</li>
	<li>
		Stop telling other members what color on the Spiral they are (let them figure it out for themselves)
	</li>
	<li>
		Stop telling other members how wrong they are
	</li>
	<li>
		Stop telling other members how unconscious they are
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Your actions are souring this forum.
</p>

<p>
	Be an example of higher consciousness on this forum. If someone provokes you, do not attack back or take their bait or justify yourself, Just let it go. If the trolls persist we will ban them, so there's no need to justify yourself in response to trolls. Take the higher ground.
</p>

<p>
	Make your points without making it personal
</p>

<p>
	Be nice
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I suspect there are a lot of people (mostly autistic-type young males) in the world who feel like you, which is why speakers like JP, Sam Harris, Dave Rubin, Stephen Molyneux, Trump, etc. have cult followings.
</p>

<p>
	It would be interesting to learn more about how their followers really feel inside and why they get triggered by Green so much. Is it just a symptom of passing from Blue to Orange? Or is it something deeper like overabundance of testosterone, resentment towards women due to inability to get laid, lack of socialization due to an overly-digital lifestyle, autistic spectrum, etc?
</p>

			Another thing i've thought about is that people somehow values stage 'green, yellow and turquoise' as 'better than lower' psychees. Isn't that also something that comes along with the thinking of 'orange' in becoming better than other persons in some kind of way?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That tendency is very hard to overcome. The ego judges "high consciousness" as "better than" low consciousness. This is of course false. A truly conscious person knows that consciousness is not better than unconsciousness. All is one. There is no better or worse. Those are all relative judgments of the ego, which are very difficult to surrender in total.

	It's just a consequence of releasing these Spiral videos. After the series is over, it will pass and we will move on to other stuff.
</p>

<p>
	It's not possible to teach Spiral Dynamics to this audience without all this hoopla.
</p>

<p>
	At the end of the series, I'm gonna tell you:
</p>

<p>
	"Now, drop all of Spiral Dynamics. It isn't true."

<p>
	Guys, when you're posting videos, try to find short snippets which demonstrate the point in a minutes or two.
</p>

<p>
	Hour long videos aren't good for this list.
</p>

<p>
	We want to find examples which distill Orange down to its essence.

<p>
	Hey, ya'll, I need your help!
</p>

<p>
	I want to create a comprehensive list of video examples of prototypical stage Orange thinking.
</p>

<p>
	This is not meant to humiliate or demonize stage Orange. It's meant to be an educational tool for people learning about Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	So towards that end, scour Youtube and find all the videos you can which exhibit stage Orange thinking. Try to find videos which are short and sweet. The more diversity we can display here, the better. Try to find examples from various cultures: Europe, Middle East, Asia, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, Africa, South America, etc.
</p>

<p>
	We will create a mega-thread like this for every stage in the Spiral, from Red to Turquoise. But here, let's just focus on Orange. Each week I will start a new mega-thread topic for the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	Do not start a political debate in this thread! It is not our goal here to defend our personal political positions or to judge any stage, but simply to compile examples.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for your help! I'm excited to see what kind of juicy stuff you dig up. Try to be selective with your choices.
</p>

<p>
	This can turn into a really cool list.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Orange Examples:
</p>

<p>
	Each one tests for lots of various substances with a color-coded chart.

<p>
	I have not done Aya.
</p>

<p>
	But 5-MeO will feel very different from everything else. There's nothing quite like it.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is extremely lucid. It's like powdered lucidity.

<p>
	You can have deep ego death experiences on pretty much any decent psychedelic. I've had it on: mushrooms, LSD, 2CB, AL-LAD, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I've yet to take a psychedelic which did not cause ego-death in me at some point.
</p>

<p>
	It all depends on you and how deeply you're willing to go.

<p>
	Yes, it's pretty scary to die.

<p>

You are spreading misinformation of this forum.

<p>
	Avoid speculating until you've had some direct experiences of what is being talked about.

	Practice some humility.

	Form is formlessness, formlessness is form.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is one. It all exists eternally as oneness.

<p>
	You body is not other than oneness.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness + a body = twoness, which is a false duality. Erase every duality you hold until only oneness remains.

	It doesn't matter what you want or think.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is happening. It's the only thing happening. Here it is.
</p>

<p>
	You can either be conscious of it or not.
</p>

<p>
	You have no choice of not-existing. Not existing is impossible. So you're shit out of luck. That's immortality.
</p>

<p>
	Good and bad are just your opinions, which are irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	You're going to exist forever. So get used to it. Or don't. Doesn't matter.

</p>

<p>
	If you ever become deeply enlightened, you will probably outgrow the need for Spiral Dynamics. Not necessarily, but at the deepest levels of consciousness, you are so far beyond the mind that all of these models and teachings will become mere child's toys.
</p>

<p>
	All the concepts I teach are not to be clung to. They are stepping stones to mystical states of consciousness and forms of cosmic intelligence which cannot be spoken.
</p>

<p>
	The things I teach are not a Bible, but a disposable ladder. Where the ladder leads you will not know until you've climbed it.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Not straight to Yellow. The kid still has to learn and integrate the prior stages. But it will certainly be easier with Yellow parents.
</p>

<p>
	It's easier to learn calculus if both your parents are calculus professors. But it still won't be automatic. You'll have to work at it. Calculus is complex stuff which requires a foundation of more basic mathematics.
</p>

<p>
	Reaching stage Yellow requires lots of education, contemplation, and self-reflection. You're probably gonna have to read hundreds of books in your life to get there.

</p>

<p>
	Not every behavior is related to Spiral Dynamics. Every culture has its unique cultural customs. Japanese people are indoctrined not to litter. In Tokyo, it's taboo to even eat or drink while walking. If you walk down the street in Tokyo eating an icecream sandwhich, people will look at you like you're walking without pants.

Enlightenment is not directly correlated with Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, it becomes easier to awaken as one becomes Yellow and Turquoise. Because the mind becomes more open and the ego becomes less clingy and constricted.
</p>

<p>
	It's very hard for a stage Blue or Orange person to persue enlightenment. Almost impossible.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment starts to become more possible at Green.

	Blue doesn't need Yellow concepts. Blue already has a full suite of pre-made judgments that they were indoctrinated with from birth.

	Your culture and peer group tells you who the devils are.

<p>
	Blue has no idea that Yellow is even a thing. Or what a concept is.

<p>
	This is a general warning to all keyboard-jockeys here who like to spout off uneducated and contrarian opinions. This forum is a not a place for venting your ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	People who keep repeatedly spreading false information will get warnings and eventual bans.
</p>

<p>
	This is not CNN, where you get to say anything you like and get away with it as though "both sides are equally right".
</p>

<p>
	This post shows zero evidence that you have actually read or studied Spiral Dynamics. It's as though you are denying the theory of evolution without having bothered to study any of the scientific literature on the model.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to present an intelligent critique of Spiral Dynamics, that's fine. But first show us that you've actually bothered to study it. Spiral Dynamics is a very nuanced model that requires dozens of hours of careful study to understand. Tell us which books you've read on the subject. Tell us which courses you've taken. Show us you've understood the model first, rather than advancing an ideologically-based rejection.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't want to study Spiral Dynamics, that's perfectly fine. But then keep your opinions about it to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	"Better" is a relative notion.
</p>

<p>
	In the Absolute sense nothing is better than anything else.
</p>

<p>
	In the relative sense, it's better to live in a Green society than a Blue society for most people.
</p>

<p>
	Higher stages are less blindly selfish and egotistical than lower stage. Which generally makes for a "better" life. You would much rather live in Alabama than in the Congo.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to be a bloodthirsty psychopath, by all means, go ahead. See how that works out for you and your people.

			Can you explain how Zen monasticism is blue? I thought most of the western folks ending up there would have seen through materialism and be looking for something deeper in their lives. I guess I'm thinking of people that have become dissolutioned with their materialistic orange based societies and seeing that consumerism doesn't make them happy. Are they not training have love and acceptance of all, and being more tolerant of all others, and ultimately progress up the spiral??

<p>
	It tends to be very traditional and conservative.
</p>

<p>
	Of course not always. But you have to see Zen as more than just enlightenment. Zen is an entire tradition, like Hinduism is.
</p>

<p>
	Even though Zen and Hinduism can lead you to enlightenment, they are usually dogmatic and Blue in their value structure.

They do things because the scriptures say so, and they'd rather die than disobey and break their honor, but, don't you think that by a total surrender of your life to something, as those Monks do, they maybe do get enlightened?
		</p>

		<p>
			I know enlightenment isn't something directly implied by the spiral dynamics, but imagine they are deeply blue, and suddenly they realize the true nature of reality and that allows them to have a massive holistic view and understanding of everything, as the higher stages do. So maybe those monks are either very blue and become very turquoise from a moment to the next one...
		</p>

<p>
	I don't doubt their enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	You can be enlightened but your value system can still be very traditional and conservative.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment alone is not enough to take you to Turquoise. Enlightenment will not magically transform your value system to Yellow or Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not directly tracking one's progress towards enlightenment. That is not what the model was designed for.
</p>

	The 9/11 hijackers were also Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Which Blue Americans find very offensive when that's pointed out to them because it's too much truth for Blue to admit.
</p>

<p>
	Blue has to deny the atrocities of Blue in order to stay Blue. Blue has a good set of justifications for distinguishing itself from other forms of Blue which are obviously unhealthy.

	Marcus Aurelius' Meditations are Blue at it's healthiest.
</p>

<p>
	Although, Aurelius has been criticized by historians for exterminating Christians. Which is not at all surprising.

	Hacksaw Ridge is probably the most positive depiction of stage Blue you're gonna find:

<p>
	Not surprising, given Mel Gibson is a stage Blue kinda guy, so he glorifies Blue.

<p>
	Well... it's a broad generalization. I can't know for sure. But Blue is the type of person who would die in the call of duty for his country/people.
</p>

<p>
	Reminds of the movie Ladder 49, which was a stage Blue tearjerker:

Rather than speculating, sit down and contemplate: What is a thought? Where does it come from? Where does it go?
</p>

<p>
	The answers are all there in your direct experience. Asking us about it will not help you. It's distraction from the work you should be doing.
</p>

<p>
	The topic of thoughts or consciousness is not a theoretical one. Thoughts are happening in real-time for you right now! So look at them to see what they are. Don't think about thoughts. Observe thoughts happening.

Then the Jews will be hanged indiscriminately, and they will remain hanging until they stink; they will hang there as long as the principles of hygiene permit. As soon as they have been untied, the next batch will be strung up, and so on down the line, until the last Jew in Munich has been exterminated. Other cities will follow suit, precisely in this fashion, until all Germany has been completely cleansed of Jews."

	I don't even understand why you're on this forum. Consciousness is not for you.

<p>
	Nationalism is ego, plain and simple.

</p>

<p>
	Start a Kriya Yoga practice. It will help you enormously with embodiment.

			Does this really have any practical implications?

</blockquote>

<p>
	The practical implications are so enormous you cannot even being to fathom them, and they cannot be easily explained to a materialist such as yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Reality does not exist!
</p>

<p>
	You were never born!
</p>

<p>
	You invented every single problem in your life!
</p>

<p>
	Do you realize how significant that is?
</p>

<p>
	It seems like abstraction to you because all you're doing is holding idealism as an idea in your mind, while holding materialism as REALITY. But what you fail to see is that to truly realize idealism means that your entire notion of reality will crumble. You're not interested in having that happen, so you merely entertain idealism as an idea. And of course, an idea of enlightenment is a pure abstraction with no practice consequences for your life.
</p>

<p>
	It is as though you are a poor man on the street complaining: "But Leo! How is the idea of being a billionaire going to change my life? It's pure abstraction! How is that going to feed me? Ideas don't pay bills."
</p>

<p>
	You're right! The idea of being a billionaire will not feed you.
</p>

<p>
	But I am not talking about an idea of being a billionaire. I am talking about a cold hard billion dollars in your pocket. Not the idea of it, but the actual thing.
</p>

<p>
	Take some LSD and see for yourself what you're missing.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a very simple practical implication:
</p>

<p>
	An idealist is immortal and cannot die. A materialist will die.
</p>

<p>
	And there are thousands more practical consequences of idealism. Like the ability to heal yourself of serious physical diseases using your mind. Which a materialist cannot do.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well ask,
</p>

<p>
	"Why did the mirage in the desert allow the desert to exist?"
</p>

<p>
	Stop masturbating and go do some self-inquiry.

</p>

<p>
	You guys sure find clever ways to justify your dictatorial leaders.
</p>

<p>
	I have studied Hitler. He was the epitome of Blue. He was also zonked out of his mind on meth and other narcotics.
</p>

<p>
	If you give someone like Alex Jones absolute power, he becomes a Hitler-like character.

<p>
	No, I never said that.
</p>

<p>
	I knew since my teenage years that my worldview is not absolutely true.
</p>

<p>
	I explained this long ago in my epistemology episodes.
</p>

<p>
	When I speak of Absolute Infinity, don't confuse that with a worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing I have ever said is the Truth. Nor will it ever be. You guys still don't get that.
</p>

<p>
	Since the first Actualized video 5 years ago, I have never been under the impression that what I say is Truth. It only seems that way from your perspective. I make a clear distinction in my mind between concept and reality. Most of you guys don't, so you project that paradigm onto my speech and teachings, which is understandable, but it gives you an inaccurate sense of my worldview.
</p>

<p>
	My worldview is that all worldviews are false, including my worldview. This has been my worldview since I was about 18.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind uses science to back up whatever worldview it has, and rejects science in those areas where it contradicts the worldview.
</p>

<p>
	The name of the game is very simple: defend my worldview come what may, at any cost, because my worldview is absolutely true.
</p>

<p>
	The delicious irony is that science uses science & reason in exactly the same manner, creating a circular justification for itself.
