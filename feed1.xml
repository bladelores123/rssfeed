</p>

<p>
	That can be tricky.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to figure that out is to contemplate honestly in your journal.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: How To Contemplate Using A Journal
</p>

<p>
	You need to really lean on radical honesty. Before you contemplate start by saying, "Okay, I'm going to be radically honest now..."
</p>

<p>
	This isn't rocket science. You DO have the answers within. You just gotta squeeze yourself a bit to get them, like the last few drops of a lemon <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	Why are Jed McKenna fans such jerks?
</p>

<p>
	I keep seeing this over and over again.
</p>

<p>
	A Course In Miracles is actually a really advanced set of genuine nondual teachings. But you've need to have an open mind and integral approach to make sense of it. Not this black and white thinking you're doing.

<title>Bufo Alvarius Toad Venom % contents and tips? (5-MeO)</title>

</p>

<p>
	Vaporizing 5-MeO is a bit tricky. You'll probably burn it a few times before you get the technique down.
</p>

<p>
	Glass Vapor Genie is the best tool for vaporizing DMT.

<p>
	It's radical no matter what.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you watched all my videos and read all the books and you think you understand it, when it finally hits you, it will be so utterly radical, you will not believe it and your entire life will collapse and you will go, "WTF?????? NO WAY! NO WAY! NO WAY! OH MY FUCKING GOD! This cannot be true! It's too RADICAL!!! Have I gone insane??? Please, someone tell me I'm not insane. Oh, fuck, there is no one who can help me. I'm all alone..."
</p>

<p>
	It is a total mindfuck beyond anything you can imagine. And there is no way to escape the mindfuck of it. So learn to love getting skullfucked by God.

</p>

<p>
	Be careful with spreading gossip and rumors unless you have direct evidence.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, it's very possible for it to be cult. But the fact is you don't know unless you've personally experienced it.
</p>

<p>
	People call Actualized.org a cult all the time. When you're dealing with large groups of people, there will also be some disgruntled and crazy ones who just make shit up and try to demonize because they get triggered by spiritual teachings. I'm sure many people out there misunderstand Mooji. Then again, I would not be surprised if it turned out to be a cult. Both are possible.
</p>

<p>
	I will shoot a video about cult psychology coming soon.
</p>

<p>
	And, BTW, enlightenment and cults are not mutually exclusive. You can have two in one! It's a very popular formula.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I would also rigorously document the clinical and therapeutic benefits, so the government would have zero basis to claim that 5-MeO has no legit medical properties. It needs to be made clear that anyone who denies the effectiveness of 5-MeO is being unscientific.

	If you mean a computer simulation.
</p>

<p>
	No. Just no. That is not what reality is.
</p>

<p>
	That is just a popular idea because we live in the era of computers and people lack imagination.

<p>
	The truth is far more radical.

You cannot consume it any other way as the smoking burns off the other stuff in venom, which is what you want. Who knows what kind of nasty toxins are in that venom.
</p>

<p>
	From what I understand the Bufotinine will mostly burn off or get overshadowed by the 5-MeO so the % does not really matter. You'd just want to start with a really small dose and work your way up inch by inch. Smoked 5-MeO is extremely fast and hard-hitting.

	For fuck's sake, Google has the answer to every question humanly imaginable.
</p>

<p>
	If only you would stop being lazy.
</p>

<p>
	I read a news article yesterday about how a woman used Google to search for "how to kill a person without getting caught"
</p>

<p>
	She found her answer and killed her two babies through suffocation.
</p>

<p>
	That's how powerful Google is.
</p>

<p>
	Of course she got caught cause she should have used DuckDuckGo and Tor instead.

</p>

<p>
	The fact is, you don't want to be enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	All you're doing here is just wasting time playing ego games and fantasizing about enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	If you were serious, you wouldn't be asking obvious stupid questions, you'd be doing the work and we would not be hearing from you.

<p>
	Yes, the problem is that many people who say "all is one" have not ACTUALIZED that statement in their own life. They've taken it on as a talking point. It is not true in their direct experience of life. So actually they are lying to themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Doing spiritual work requires us to be honest about where we currently are. We have to stop and ask ourselves, "Is 'all is one' true for me?", and the answer will often be No.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not enlightened, it is a bad idea to go around talking and acting as if you were.
</p>

<p>
	If you have not directly experienced God, it is a bad idea to go around talking and thinking God exists. The truth is, for you, God does not exist.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	All of that is ego.
</p>

<p>
	That whole post is ego playing drama queen.
</p>

<p>
	You have not reached meaninglessness, because clearly you are creating a lot of negative meaning here.
</p>

<p>
	What is required is more consciousness. It's sort of like you've wounded the ego, not anywhere close to killing it, and now it's pissed off like an angry hornets nest.
</p>

<p>
	A little bit of consciousness is a dangerous thing, as they say.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is go back to the basic practices and ground yourself in high quality nondual theory and mindfulness work.
</p>

<p>
	You are trying to do this too fast. It does not work that way. There are many facets to consciousness work. When you try to jump ahead to the end before you are truly developed enough to handle it, you just create a massive ego backlash and nothing sticks.
</p>

<p>
	Ground yourself in core daily practices like meditation. Train yourself to do it consistently and with joy.
</p>

<p>
	Do not take Iboga by yourself, and unless you're a veteran of psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	You could seriously harm yourself otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're asking to play with a live hand grenade.

<p>
	No, that is not what I mean when I say that brain does not exist. I mean something far more radical. I also mean your body does not really exist.
</p>

<p>
	Nor does "the brain" serve the metaphysical role you believe it serves (the ground and source of existence).
</p>

<p>
	The brain is a part of the mind. There really isn't a brain because all there is, is mind.

<p>
	A) That's a really old video, prior to my various deep nondual insights like brains do not exist.
</p>

<p>
	B) "The brain" is a relative construct, a symbol within a network of symbols we use to make sense of the world. It has a certain relative meaning, in the same way that the word "country" has a certain relative meaning even though there is no such thing as "a country" in the world.

<p>
	This issue keeps coming up again and again and I keep telling you guys the same simple solution:
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics!
</p>

<p>
	Stop all the mental masturbating and go experience an altered state of consciousness. Then you will understand what this work is about. It's NOT what you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	It is like you're a child asking, "But what are the benefits of an orgasm? Logically explain to me why I should stick my penis inside a vagina."
</p>

<p>
	Do it and see what happens.

<p>
	125ug of LSD takes me into full God-mode. But this is not going to be the case for the average tripper. They would probably need to triple that dose to get a similar effect.
</p>

<p>
	Tolerance to psychedelics can vary quite significantly from person to person.
</p>

<p>
	And one's level of cognitive/metaphysical development plays an important role in how deeply you trip, from what I can tell.
</p>

<p>
	My trips are always extremely profound, beyond most trip reports. I'm not sure why this is. It feels like psychedelics were designed specifically for my brain/mind type.

<p>
	Meditation is about stilling the mind to an extreme degree.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation involves using the mind.

"The process" is DIRECT!
</p>

<p>
	The content IS the process! There is zero distance between rendering and the thing displayed.
</p>

<p>
	Because reality has infinite power, it does not require a computational process. There is no process. There is only the end result.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of reality as a computer simulation. It is NOT that. It is direct, instantaneous, magic.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing behind the scenes. What you see is all there is, so to speak. The problem is, your mind does not know how to make sense of reality this way. You are used to analyzing it conceptually into a linear chain of cause and effect. This is fantasy, not reality.

<p>
	Everything you see IS the experience of consciousness creating the dream.

<p>
	The mechanism of creation is not hidden behind the scenes somewhere. It is TOTALLY, RADICALLY direct! You are seeing God's creation process every second. You're just overlooking it because you're expecting something elsewhere. Your fantasy of God's creation process is obscuring awareness of God's actual creation process.

At least for now, until you find something better.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get too cute with stuff like: I'm going to master myself. Yes, of course you will. But you also want some tangible marketable skills which you can use to build a career around.
</p>

<p>
	When you commit to something like "I will master teaching" or "I will master writing" or "I will master speaking", that is a very powerful and actionable intention. It sets you on a solid and clear career path.
</p>

<p>
	When you say something like "I will master myself" I picture you 10 years from now living in your mom's basement sniffing your own farts. Because it's such a vague and abstract intention.
</p>

<p>
	What tangible things are you gonna offer the world once you've mastered you?
</p>

<p>
	The world is not gonna pay you to sit there basking in your own self-mastery.

</p>

<p>
	Which should be enough to get you seriously interested in reading books about LP and doing research.
</p>

<p>
	Do you want to live a passionate life?
</p>

<p>
	Yes?
</p>

<p>
	Then how can you not be passionate about reading a few books about how to create a passionate life???
</p>

<p>
	That's like wanting to be a millionaire but then saying, "Oh man... I don't want to read these books about becoming a millionaire."
</p>

<p>
	Think it through. Connect the dots.
</p>

<p>
	As I said in the Life Is A Maze video, you're in a maze whether you like it or not. So you might as well get curious and passionate about doing research to figure this maze out. You got something more important to do?
</p>

<p>
	To be successful at life you gotta love learning about how life works. Why don't you love learning about life?
</p>

<p>
	Living up to your highest ideals is very challenging. Only very serious students of consciousness work can do it.
</p>

<p>
	And even then, it is also very important to learn to drop your ideals, as they are ultimately imaginary and stand in the way of full acceptance of reality.
</p>

<p>
	I will talk more about the downsides of having high ideals in the future.

</p>

<p>
	You are a like an arrogant freshman who thinks he knows more than the professor teaching the class, trying to school the professor. It's just naive arrogance.
</p>

<p>
	I am pointing you to things you have clearly not become conscious of yet. I'm not here trying to brainwash you into my dogma. You just haven't done enough inner work or research to understand the complexity of these issues yet.
</p>

<p>
	This is not personal, or a debate. You just need to be willing to learn and explore new perspectives. That is all. There is no need to get defensive. I am here to help you. You are not being asked to believe anything here on blind faith. You are being invited to inquire deeply and openmindedly into the true nature of what meaning, value, and morality are. Not what you think they are. Not what you want them to be. But what they ACTUALLY are: constructions of your mind.

</p>

<p>
	Which is what I was pointing out to you.
</p>

<p>
	But you keep clinging to morality as truth without being open to other possibilities. So they conversation is useless. You hold morality as an unquestionable dogma. That is the issue here.
</p>

<p>
	Love is a facet of Absolute Being. It's not a moral issue but an existential one. You're conflating love and morality.

<p>
	Hallucination is a very specific word which has a precise definition: "An appearance without substance. A purely mental phenomena which does not correspond with any external objective thing." That's reality.

What you are intuiting the is infinity nature of reality. That's because it really is infinite. Which means that you will never pin down the Truth with finite symbols or thoughts. Cause/effect is a linear, dualistic, finite scheme which cannot get at the whole of reality. It can only get at finite, limited pieces of reality. It will always be just a partial map, never the whole territory.
</p>

<p>
	The territory is truly infinite, nonlinear, and non-causal.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you can have a direct insight that every object in your room has an infinite chain of causes leading to its creation. I once become conscious that my Apple laptop power cord was created by an infinite chain of causes. What a mindfuck that was. To this day I cannot look at my power cord the same way again.
</p>

<p>
	Every object in your room has actually existed for eternity.

<title>Problems Only Being Within The Mind</title>

How you feel about a situation is definitely created by the way your mind evaluates or interprets it. And this you can definitely change with lots of consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	You may not be able to change how your son behaves. But that does not matter because the key is to change how you feel about how he behaves.
</p>

<p>
	If you were more grounded in yourself your sons action's -- as bad as they might be -- would not bother you nearly as much, and you would also be more resourceful at finding an external solution, like for example, helping him to pinpoint the root cause of his problems.
</p>

<p>
	What consciousness will teach you is to let go of control and to surrender and accept terrible things gracefully.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that you can always control every bad thing in life is foolish. It just cannot happen because fundamentally the ego is not in control of anything. Control is one of the chief illusions which consciousness work tackles. You have to learn to accept things more. Counter-intuitively, this will make you more powerful, not less.
</p>

<p>
	One = Many
</p>

<p>
	Many = One
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute reincarnates infinitely as EVERYTHING. That's nonduality. Not only that, you are ALL beings at all times right now! You just aren't conscious of it. There is no need to wait for an afterlife as you are ALL beings already right now.
</p>

<p>
	There is nowhere in the universe you can go where you are already not. You are the whole shebang!

<p>
	The purpose of most businesses is never about helping people, it is about maximizing profit.
</p>

<p>
	So of course! Maximizing profit at the expense of others is the go-to strategy for becoming wealthy.
</p>

<p>
	This is the very definition of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	But it doesn't have to be that way. It's possible to run a conscious business that doesn't prioritize profit. Of course this means less profit. Which is why so few people choose this path.

</p>

<p>
	That is what most people do.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem with it is, it's fundamentally based on falsehood, which requires that you enter a cycle of self-denial which then creates lots of suffering and stifles your ability to be a conscious and loving human being.
</p>

<p>
	To be truly moral, you must surrender morality.
</p>

<p>
	Is it threatening to your way of life? Of course, which is why almost nobody does it. Takes massive courage and lots of inner work. But it is worth it.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive solution is to surrender your way of life.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12390-sagemodeaustin/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="12390" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12390-sagemodeaustin/" rel="">@SageModeAustin</a> You should draw a distinction between inherent objective value vs having personal preferences.
</p>

<p>
	Absolutely-speaking, everything has equal value.
</p>

<p>
	Relatively-speaking, some things have more survival value to you than other things. Value is a relative notion. A thing has instrumental value to you precisely because it helps the ego survive.
</p>

<p>
	You can be conscious that all human beings have equal Absolute value, but you can still be selective about who you hang out with. For example, even though a murder has the same Absolute value as a non-murder, it would be foolish and even dangerous to make friends with a bunch of murders.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make is that they then take the extra step of demonizing murders and denying that they have equal Absolute value.
</p>

<p>
	So, you can be very selective about who you choose to sleep with, but it would be a mistake to demonize and judge those women who you don't want to sleep with. Just be honest and admit to yourself, "I don't want to sleep with that person. But this does not diminish that person in any way. They can still be a good person even though I don't find them sexually attractive."
</p>

<p>
	The mistake that guys like you make is that they think like this: "That women is ugly to me, therefore she is a low, worthless human being." This is a narcissistic evaluation. You are saying that just because a person doesn't fit your survival agenda that they are somehow inherently flawed or lower. When the truth is, she just doesn't fit your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Also realize that when you call anything in reality "ugly" you are actually disowning that aspect of reality, of yourself. Because the truth is, that ugly thing you hate is actually, literally, metaphysically, your very self. So you are placing yourself in an adversarial relationship with reality, with yourself! Which is the very definition of neurosis.
</p>

<p>
	When you call a thing "ugly" you are failing to become conscious of its inherent beauty. The beauty is there no matter what. But you are failing to see it because you are being too self-centered.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to live in a non-judgmental way.
</p>

<p>
	The irony of chasing hot girls is that the karma of it always comes back to bite you in the ass and make you suffer. Just by thinking, "Oooooo... look at this hot girl, so much better than that ugly fat girl" you are causing your own misery without realizing it. When you lose that hot girl, it will hurt all the more.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying you should sleep with girls you aren't attracted to. But you might want to reconsider the way you objectify women and use them to gratify your most base, most low consciousness desires in a purely materialistic fashion. Maybe rather than basing your attraction purely on looks, you give more weight to her personality and her level of consciousness, and you focus more on how you can give her love rather than how she can please you.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason a hot girl has value to you is because you crave her. And yes, it is possible to let go of craving. The trick is convincing your ego to do it.
</p>

<p>
	Careful, it is a cult-like organization.
</p>

<p>
	You can find non-cult-like forms of meditation or yoga which are just as effective if not more effective, and without the cult ideology.
</p>

<p>
	Many cults have legit spiritual techniques that they offer to newbies, but they are still manipulative cults.

<p>
	The downside of hardwiring anything is that you then become inflexible in a rapidly changing environment.
</p>

<p>
	The most effective survival strategy is not mechanical, but highly intelligent, fluid, and conscious.

</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not a model for diagnosing or understanding legit mental disorders. So watch out. Spiral Dynamics is based on "normal" or "average" people.

<title>How To Stop Creating Physical Pain?</title>

</p>

<p>
	The reason spiritual traditions all over the world use suffering as spiritual practice is because it awakens the mind, while pleasure and comfort usually dulls the mind into unconsciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Same idea as cold showers.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is often done is a dysfunction, pathological, moralistic manner, which is the opposite of consciousness.

	The forum software is a very complex piece of code and it can only do certain things. It is not possible to modify the code willy-nilly.
</p>

<p>
	Editing of posts is deliberately disabled after 48 hours because people abuse the editing feature to stealth-change their posts.

<p>
	Depends of course on the particular skill. There are so many!
</p>

<p>
	Lynda.com is great for all sorts of technical computer skills.
</p>

<p>
	You can pretty reliably create a six-figure income just from mastering a handful of the skills on Lynda.com

Rather, you are being invited to become conscious of how you are creating suffering. That is all.
</p>

<p>
	Don't turn consciousness work into some sort of normative morality guilt trip.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to do anything. If you want to kill yourself, you are free to do so. There are no shoulds here. It's a question of how you want to live life.
</p>

<p>
	It would be pretty stupid to live life kicking yourself in the nuts everyday. But of course you are free to do so.
</p>

<p>
	Just think about how stupid what you are saying is.
</p>

<p>
	If you had to power to stop your own suffering, you would do so without hesitation.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like you live a cushy life without having suffered deeply. One day, you will face suffering so deep you will rethink your compacent position about it.
</p>

<p>
	You have no good sense yet how deep humans can suffer.
</p>

<p>
	Let's see how you will feel after you get into a car crash and half your face burns off in the fire. At which point you post your whiney victim story here and we will respond with: "How is this any different than joy? Why is suffering bad?"
</p>

<p>
	Then you will rethink your position.
</p>

<p>
	The ego loves to talk shit and act aloof while it is safe and comfy. But then, as soon as it gets a scratch, it cries and whines about how life is terrible and unfair.
</p>

<p>
	No, enlightenment is not like another other activity or distraction. There is being inside the Matrix and then there is being outside the Matrix.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea yet how radically different enlightenment is from anything you've ever done.
</p>

<p>
	If you like sufferring, you can continue to suffer. But the truth is, you hate sufferring and would be much happier if you could deconstruct it.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic and see for yourself why consciousness is desirable.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	What is the point of your investing?

<p>
	Also, keep in mind that just because something qualifies as a life purpose doesn't mean it should be YOUR life purpose. Your LP needs to fit you like a glove.

<title>How To Stop Creating Physical Pain?</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Strong Determination Sitting is a good way to work on consciousness of pain.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't easy to do, but try to sit for so long that you get to the point where the excruciating pain of your sit turns into pleasure. It's a very distinct inflection point that happens during long, serious sits.
</p>

<p>
	As you sit there in pain for an hour or more, you have ample time to contemplate: What is pain? What is suffering?
</p>

<p>
	With pain and suffering it's very important to try to contemplate it WHILE IT IS HAPPENING, not after the fact. This cuts through speculation and theorizing.
</p>

<p>
	My guess is, you'd have to be pretty deeply enlightened to be able to deconstruct pain in the way Ralston talks about. Because so long as the ego is intact it will bitch and whine and moan and resist too much. A deep surrender is required.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston is talking about super-human levels of consciousness. So don't be discouraged if you can't get it fast.
</p>

<p>
	It might be easier to do this using a much simpler image, like a red triangle or white circle or the yin-yang.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, these might bore you, but if you get bored easily then that's precisely what you must work through. Boredom is the ego-mind's resistance to truth and higher consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Boredom is not easy to work through, but therein lies the spiritual purification.
</p>

<title>The Nature of Perceptions</title>

What you presently think of as perception will eventually -- at high levels of consciousness -- get recontextualized into Absolute being.
</p>

<p>
	Perception only appears to exist because the ego is co-opting Absolute being as its own "perceptions".
</p>

<p>
	In truth, you are not perceiving anything. Absolute Infinity is being itself but because you believe you were born, you are misinterpreting Absolute being as "my perceptions of reality".
</p>

<p>
	Without a belief in a separate self, there is no perception. The notion of perception carries with it a hidden implicit metaphysics: subject/object (duality). When you become really conscious, this duality collapses and you realize that perception was never taking place. Absolute being was taking place.
</p>

<p>
	This may sound like a semantic word game, but I assure you its not. It's a very radical and palpable shift in consciousness. You will feel it like getting struck with a lightning bolt. Your whole sense of reality will flip inside out as your consciousness up-shifts from relative perception to Absolute being. Visually, nothing may change, but your understanding of what you thought your visual field was will radically change.

<p>
	And on top of that, use drug testing kits to verify your substance is a genuine indole.
</p>

<p>
	Be especially suspicious of substances which don't look pure (brown, grey, yellow, pink, dirty-looking, chunky, etc.).

<p>
	As far as interpreting imagery goes, the human mind can only understand reality via images and symbols. That's what understanding is regardless of whether it is scientific or spiritual understanding, literal or poetic. There really isn't a difference between literal and poetic understanding. So the mind, especially during a trip, will use whatever images it can to understand the vast complexity of reality. All sorts of strange symbols and images can arise, and they are all relative to that mind's intellectual framework. Truth and wisdom will be communicated in whatever way works FOR THAT MIND. To a Christian mind it might be the face of Jesus, to a Hindu mind it might be the face of Vishnu, to an atheist mind it might be a mathematical formula or a logical axiom, etc.
</p>

<p>
	All of it is just arbitrary symbols which only have meaning relatively, WITHIN the framework of that person's mind. It's like a language, which only makes sense and has meaning to those people who speak the language. To an outsider, it is just noise.
</p>

<p>
	Of course dissociatives can be used for accessing profound mystical states.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is, they tend to be physically harmful to the body, and also addictive.
</p>

<p>
	Ketamine can become very addictive and prolonged usages destroys the kidneys I believe. Which is why I do not recommend them. Why take those risks when you can have mindblowing mystical experiences on totally safe and non-addictive substances like LSD, mushrooms, or DMT?
</p>

<p>
	After a 5-MeO breakthrough, even small doses of LSD or mushrooms will be fully nondual, infinite experiences.
</p>

<p>
	I don't need more than 125ug of LSD to take to me to full God-mode.
</p>

<p>
	With so many safe psychedelics to explore, I would leave dissociatives for last on the list, after you've explored 2C-B, DMT, 5-MeO, MDMA, mushrooms, etc.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, once you try 5-MeO, you will not want anything else. It is a psychedelic in a league of its own. It makes LSD seem like a toy (and LSD is no toy).
</p>

<title>Is becoming socially withdrawn a part of the Self-actualization journey?</title>

<p>
	There are healthy and unhealthy ways to be socially withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
	In the healthy version, you desire isolation so that you can focus on working on your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Many sages have socially withdrawn themselves to high degrees that would seem unhealthy to most people. But they were just hardcore in their practices. This isn't strictly necessary, but it may be for some people for some period of time until they finish their work.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, there is only the one Self, so all those other people are none other than you. So whether you are with people or not, you are still always alone.
</p>

<p>
	There is no problem being alone as long as you enjoy it and you are not becoming more and more depressed or mentally unstable.
</p>

<title>Vanity and Spiral Dynamics</title>

</p>

<p>
	When contemplating this stuff, you must probe beneath the stories and excuses like, "My Dad caused this", or "It was because of my childhood" and get to the root of why you are still attached to it. Attachments like this are always rooted in your survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	So what do you fear will happen to you if you let go of vanity and appearance?
</p>

<p>
	What would happen if you became ugly and everyone thought you were a cheap nasty whore?
</p>

<p>
	How would that hurt your ego/survival? Why are you giving people that power over you?
</p>

<p>
	What is vanity/appearance REALLY giving you? Love? Happiness? Success? Self-esteem?
</p>

<p>
	Hint: it's giving you something positive, otherwise you wouldn't keep doing it.
</p>

<p>
	What if your self-esteem was completely independent of your appearance? What would be bad about that? What if you were ugly and yet you still loved yourself just as much as when you were pretty?
</p>

<p>
	Sit down and really contemplate all that in a brutally honesty manner.
</p>

<p>
	Also, get very specific and clear about what you mean by "vanity" and "appearance", as these are very vague notions.
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness and Infinity are identical. So this Nothingness is infinitely intelligent. That's what you are intuiting but not yet fully grasping.

<title>The mechanism of creating distinctions</title>

</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, reality cannot have a substance because there is nothing within reality which can be used to as a ground, and no one to arbitrate between any truth claim.
</p>

<p>
	Being cannot know itself precisely because it is itself. Or rather, being can come to know that being is fundamentally groundless and therefore mystical.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be a ground other than emptiness because any other ground would itself be in need of another ground, and so on, ad infinitum.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, the ground vs not-ground is also a distinction.
</p>

<p>
	Here we have reached the end of language. Anything said about the Ultimate Ground (The Groundless Ground) must be self-negating because the ultimate nature of reality is nondual, but all language works by creating dualities (distinctions). So anything we could say or think about the Absolute will be dualistic, which is the opposite of what it is. But... also not the opposite! (See how I have to negate my own words when talking about it?) Because to say anything about it is to give it a specific, distinct quality. But the Absolute is unbounded, infinite. But... also it is bounded and finite! (Again, I have to negate any quality I attribute to it).
</p>

<p>
	This is why Zen is so Zen. The Truth breaks logic and language alike because the Truth is infinite while logic and language are finite.

</p>

<p>
	DO NOT think about what suffering is. OBSERVE what suffering is in your direct experience!
</p>

<p>
	You suffer every day. The next time you suffer, OBSERVE it, and contemplate what you are observing.
</p>

<p>
	Avoid speculating or philosophizing about suffering. You don't need to speculate about it, it's RIGHT THERE every day in your life!
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Not only is it there, you are creating it! Another good question to contemplate is: Why did I create this suffering? Again, avoid speculation. Stick as closely to direct experience as possible.

<p>
	Like I said, I've tried those scales and they never gave me consistent results.
</p>

<p>
	Microscoops are better.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a scale is 0.001g does not mean it can actually measure out 10mg precisely. Most of these scales will barely even register a 10mg dose. It will read as zero on the scale many times. These scales assume you're weighting a fairly heavy object to begin with, like 100mg, then it will give you 0.001g accuracy. But not on a 10mg sample.

</p>

<p>
	You can intuit and trust, but none of that it is direct consciousness of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to get lulled into a false sense of comfort with such trust. Billions of religious people do it every day, and it becomes a huge obstacle to awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Trust, but verify.
</p>

<p>
	That's where 5-MeO becomes very handy. It will show you where that trust fully leads.
</p>

<p>
	Right now it's sort of like you're saying, "Yeah, I trust that Japan is a real place. I've never been, but I trust it."
</p>

<p>
	Okay, that's better than distrusting Japan. But it's a whole nother thing to actually go to Japan and roam the streets of Tokyo. It would be a trap to trust in Japan so much that you never actually bother traveling there. None of your ideas about Japan can compare to actually being in Japan.

<p>
	Distinction is a very tricky issue because distinction is the very nature of being.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully understood what a distinction was, you would understand the ultimate nature of reality, and you would be deeply enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	<strong><u>Distinction is NOT a concept!</u></strong>
</p>

<p>
	Distinction is the "substance" of reality. And what then is the nature of a distinction? Nothing!
</p>

<p>
	Yes, paradox here is not a mistake. What you're starting to intuit is that reality has no substance. It's a set of distinct appearances which are actually just a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not made out of matter or atoms or energy. Reality is made out of distinctions!
</p>

<p>
	Creation is distinction. Without distinction you have pure formless Infinity. And with distinction, you also have pure Infinity! The formed side of Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Form is formlessness. Formlessness is form.
</p>

<p>
	Duality is none other than nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity contains an infinite number of distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	It's highly worthwhile to contemplate: What is a distinction?
</p>

<p>
	-------
</p>

<p>
	Mind vs not-mind = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Automatic vs not automatic = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness vs unconsciousness = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Real vs unreal = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Subjective vs objective = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Truth vs falsehood = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	Creation vs destruction = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	The universe vs me = a distinction
</p>

<p>
	------
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the substanceless substance within which all of these distinctions occur. Like an LCD screen on which images are rendered.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you've ever seen or thought or experienced is a distinction. Including existence itself.
</p>

<p>
	SD is a complex model which requires serious study and contemplation to understand fully.
</p>

<p>
	All of these issues you brought are up only apparent issue because you haven't fully understood the model yet and you are not quite properly interpreting history. For example America was not more Green in the 60's than today. That is confusing the hippie movement with the average level of the entire country. In the 60's America was heavy Blue/Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Atheists are not Blue, they are just stubbornly Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Each stage builds on all the prior ones, so there is no contradiction in a Green or even Turquoise person starting a business. Business takes place at every stage, just following different values.

<p>
	Not so what.
</p>

<p>
	More like: HOLY FUCKING FUCK!!!
</p>

<p>
	But you don't get this yet because you have no idea yet what "I'm God" really means. To you it's just an idea. Which of course is "so what?"

Those milligram scales are still way too imprecise. They cannot properly measure a 10gm dose. To them, 10mg to 20mg all feels the same. I have used several different milligram scales and they are all terrible.

<p>
	Consistency of powder is a non-issue if you're using the same batch. And even between batches is it not much of an issue unless you have totally difference sources.

	Sounds like you probably don't have a store account yet.

<p>
	Teachers have different styles. This is why its good to study hundreds of different perspectives. Each one will expose you to some new facet that the other ones didn't.
</p>

<p>
	Teachers place different emphasis on things due to their unique personality, cultural background, path through life, and even their gender or level of testosterone.
</p>

<p>
	Never expect one teacher to explain everything to you. It just isn't possible.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, finding a teacher who you resonant with perfectly is bad because then you will tend to blindly accept what he/she says without thinking for yourself or considering other sources.
</p>

<p>
	Focus more on grasping what is being taught in your direct experience rather than daydreaming about or judging the teacher.
</p>

<p>
	The teacher you resonate with very much depends on what your particular needs are at this moment in time. In a few years, as your needs change, so will your teachers -- if you don't commit yourself to worshiping just one.
</p>

<p>
	My teachings are definitely not complete, and definitely contain some mistakes and shadow. This is not a problem so long as you think for yourself, make use many sources, and do your reading. Just listening to me is not enough to succeed in this work.
</p>

<p>
	I'm actually surprised at how successful Jed's books have been.
</p>

<p>
	He sort of bucks the trend.
</p>

<p>
	Although of course most people reading his books have no idea what he's really pointing to, or ever do the practice he suggests. He sort of obscures the practice with all his smartassery and story-telling.
</p>

<p>
	Jed's work is sort of a cult classic.
</p>

The only thing is that you haven't really gone all the way yet. You got a small glimpse, but not the Full Monty.
</p>

<p>
	When plugging, it's very important to make sure that your bowels are empty, otherwise the substance will not absorb fully.
</p>

<p>
	Measuring 5-MeO using a micro-scoop is far superior than using a scale. Scales are just not sensitive enough. Get a micro-scoop on Amazon (like this: <a href="https://amzn.to/2oguKiE" rel="external nofollow">https://amzn.to/2oguKiE</a> ) and use the same micro-scoop each time so your doses are consistent.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you might need to smoke it to get the Full Monty. Or just increase your plugged dose.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, at high doses, it gets freaky.
</p>

<p>
	But having that Fully Monty breakthrough is paramount. Until then, you still don't understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	Doing it with Octavio should definitely get you a breakthrough. Smoking is MUCH more intense than plugging. Plugging is like a walk in the park compared to smoking it. With smoking, the ego should not be able to hold on or resist in any way.
</p>

<p>
	Because no one would buy it if it said, "You gotta do 10,000 hours of work".
</p>

<p>
	People want easy answers. That is what sells.
</p>

<p>
	The popularity of your product/service in the marketplace is directly proportional to how easy and effortless you make your solution sound.
</p>

<p>
	"Enlightenment In 15 Minutes" << That's the video every fool clicks on.
</p>

<p>
	The most serious teachers, who emphasize hard work, are the ones you'll never hear of because they are not mass market.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: The Deep Problem of Marketing.
</p>

<p>
	To sell enlightenment effectively, you gotta simplify it and dumb it down to the point that hardly anyone who listens to you will ever attain it.
</p>

<p>
	If a guru told you what enlightenment really is, no one would buy it.
</p>
