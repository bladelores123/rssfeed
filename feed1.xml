<p>
	That is the nature of all words. They all mean things.
</p>

<p>
	The very thing you dislike about the word "devilry" is the very thing I like about it and why I use it. It's provocative. It can be powerful to call a devil a devil to his face.
</p>

<p>
	When I call a viewer a devil, that has a certain affect on their psyche. It punches through the veil. A devil doesn't like being called out.

</p>

<p>
	There is no argument here.
</p>

<p>
	Every word is a category. How you draw your categories is relative to how you want to frame things.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you used the category Maya. Which is similar to the category of devilry.

<p>
	Now it's time to infect the world.
</p>

<p>
	Muahahahahah....
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty silly though to grow psilocybin via bacteria when you can just chemically synthesize kilograms of it in a lab in hours.
</p>

<p>
	Synthesizing psychedelics is so easy for scientists and medical companies.
</p>

<p>
	There exist ways of synthesizing DMT simply from stirring together basic chemical reagents in plastic tubs.

			Yes, but do you also think that blind selfishness and deception are utterly pure and the highest form of Consciousness and being? In a way I am asking you to abandon the framing of "Higher and Lower Consciousness".
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	All these terms and framings are relative. You can frame reality in a thousand different ways.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness and deception could be defined as opposites of Consciousness and Being.
</p>

<p>
	Or they could be integrated into a larger unity.
</p>

<p>
	It all depends on how you want to frame things.
</p>

<p>
	We make verbal and conceptual distinctions to do certain intellectual work. Lumping everything into one thing isn't always helpful.
</p>

<p>
	For example, telling someone that Trump is the purest, highest form of consciousness would be highly misleading. It's useful in this case to call Trump a devil.
</p>

			What I am trying to point to is that this is all within Worldness, God accepts all of Worldness. So the closer we get to Godness, if we were to frame it as a duality, would we not more and more come to see the utter Wisdom in all aspects of Isness, including suffering? Would we really call it devilry? Could we infact call it anything at all?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Which is why I said devil = God.
</p>

<p>
	Devilry is a relative term. You have to understand what it means in the context I use it in. I use this as a technical term in my overall framework to refer to acts of blind selfishness and deception.
</p>

<p>
	So when I say, "Trump is a devil" I mean a very specific thing.
</p>

<p>
	Reality has a devilish aspect to it. This is the aspect of trickery and illusion. So deny devilry is silly. Yet of course devilry is just an aspect of God in the big picture.

<p>
	Probably. Intrinsic motivation is the best kind.
</p>

<p>
	But also, being self-taught does not contradict school or education. I am self-taught precisely because I had a great formal education.
</p>

<p>
	Formal education primes the pump for self-teaching. The point of school is to teach you how to teach yourself and make you passionate about learning. Of course many schools are bad at doing this. But some succeed.
</p>

<p>
	Going to university does not contradict being self-taught. If you attend university properly you will turn it into a self-teaching program.

<p>
	Sure you can test it, but before a thing even deserves to be tested, you gotta at least explain how it should work in theory.

<p>
	If your plane cannot even fly in theory, testing it will not magically make it fly.

<p>
	Obviously not since this problem does not exist in Canada and in most other wealthy developed countries.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is not lack of doctors. The problem is the corporate greed and devilry of the US healthcare industry cartel.
</p>

<p>
	There is no reason why everyone in America cannot have decent healthcare. But the healthcare industry would have to make a lot less profit off sick people. There's your real bottleneck.
</p>

<p>
	And no amount of robots or AI will solve this problem. Be careful with your tech fantasies. Tech does not resolve fundamental problems of devilry, it makes them worse.

<title>Can creativity be &quot;damaged&quot;?</title>

<p>
	Creativity can be damaged in the following sense: if you feel creative urges yet you ignore them because of fear about practical matters like money, etc, and if you do that long enough, eventually you will lose your soul and turn into a zombie.
</p>

<p>
	You must act on your creative passions. In a sensible and non-reckless way.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			"If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you."
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:right;">
			-- Gospel of Thomas
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Why are you wasting a minute of your life doing anything which isn't your highest creative passion? Can you see how foolish and inefficient such action is? You are pissing millions of dollars of value down the drain this way. Your time should be your most precious commodity. Don't sell it to fools for pennies.

<p>
	That's the voice of God speaking to you, but you're refusing the call.
</p>

<p>
	You're acting too small. You need a much bigger vision. You need a big life purpose, not this wallowing is personal problems bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	God is telling you to make your life about something much bigger than you. But you're too scared so you just wallow around in your own smallness. You should be doing big things with your life. Why aren't you doing them? You could transform the whole world and yet you're just pissing your life away instead.

</ul>

<p>
	And do my LP Course. It's all about this.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you're depressed because you're not actualizing your full greatness. You could be a Christ or a Buddha. What are you waiting for??? Your spirituality is far too timid. Be more bold! Dare to touch people's hearts with your love.

<p>
	That's right, ego is superior at illusion, lying, and devilry. Which is precisely its function.
</p>

<p>
	You merge the two like so:
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be awakening without survival. So any rejection of survival is ultimately a rejection of God. So by rejecting the devil you reject God. Because the devil is God.
</p>

<p>
	Ego = God
</p>

<p>
	The circle is complete.

<p>
	Balance IS the key. But balance is not taking the mid-point of any given two positions.
</p>

<p>
	Balance can be radical at times.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you're considering slavery vs no slavery, the balanced position is not half-slavery, it is no slavery. The balanced position required a Civil War.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is being able to recognize the Civil War as an act of balance. Most people would be too myopic to see it as such.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the balanced position with regards to Trump is to put him on trial and send him to jail for any crimes he committed. Of course no Trump supporter would consider that balanced or fair. Yet that is the truth of it. The problem is that self-bias warps one's sense of balance, fairness, and truth.
</p>

<p>
	In truth nobody cares about balance or fairness or truth, they care about survival at any costs.
</p>

<p>
	From the ego's POV, "balance" is whatever serves the ego. But that isn't true balance, that's devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why Fox News used to call itself "Fair and Balanced"
</p>

<p>
	It's classic Orwellian devilry. They are precisely not fair and balanced which is why they seek to call themselves such. That's self-deception 101. Which is why likes to call himself "a stable genius". Precisely because he isn't that.
</p>

<p>
	An actual stable genius has no need to go around telling people he is a stable genius.
</p>

<p>
	Many private doctors in the US are booked for weeks or months at a time. Even with private plans you still often have to wait. The better the doctor the longer you usually have to wait.
</p>

<p>
	So the idea of immediate care is a myth. Especially for serious conditions.
</p>

<p>
	But also, having to wait 2 weeks is a small price to pay when the alternative might be that you get no coverage at all or you go into medical bankruptcy due to medical bills. Most conditions can wait a few weeks. Emergency rooms are available for urgent stuff.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course the whole point of any universal social service is that it will not be as good as the best private services. But that's a reasonable sacrifice for the greater good of allowing everyone in the country to get the service.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, if you have an elite private plan, a public plan will be a downgrade for you because 330 million people cannot all have an elite service -- by definition. What you must realize though is that your personal survival is not the only issue here. Yes, in a society you have to make a personal sacrifices so that others can have some benefit too.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, if you're super rich higher taxes are bad for you personally. But living in a society requires thinking about bigger issues than just your personal gain.
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally, you have to share your resources in a society. That's what society is. This is what conservatives and libertarians don't understand here. What's required is a paradigm shift where you're not merely thinking about what is maximally beneficial to you and your family, but what is good for society as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	Just because it's good for you and your family to have a giant monopoly which earns you billions of dollars doesn't mean it's good for society. In a sense, you are leeching off society but calling it your own labor.
</p>

<p>
	What needs to be acknowledged is how much a well-functioning society enables your success. Human success does not happen outside of a society. If you were born in the wrong society you would be a slave. Don't forget that. Your elite healthcare plan is not some entitlement you deserve. It's a function of how society is structured, of which you were a lucky beneficially. You could have easily wound up on the losing end of the structure.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you had to wait 3 years to go to a doctor because you couldn't afford it. Well, that happens to people every day.
</p>

	Just do the investigation and be open to whatever may come.
</p>

<p>
	You don't know how it will go or what the rules are. You'll figure it out by doing it, not by asking me for answers.
</p>

	Be careful just off-loading the problem onto some magical AI or robots. AI and robots are not going to magically solve our problems. They will create as many new problems are they solve.

<p>
	If robots ever get good enough to replace teachers, humans will be in trouble.
</p>

<p>
	At that point, what is the point of educating humans? Just replace humans with robots.

<title>A funny policy proposal // Asynchronous voting</title>

<p>
	Lots of problems with this model.
</p>

<p>
	How would a new political candidate ever get noticed? Voting would be reduced to a perfunctory process which few people would get engaged in. It would be hard to build a consensus for anything new progressive policy proposal.
</p>

<p>
	It's important that we have national debates and conversations about which direction the country should go in. At least election cycles allow for that. Clear cut election cycles make people more engaged I think. Otherwise everything will get muddled and luke-warm. It will be hard to even know who's in office.
</p>

<p>
	It would be better to just make voting day a national holiday.

<title>A Model for Free Global Education (Massively Online)</title>

<p>
	In practice this isn't good enough. There are many online universities already. But most of them are crap. Education involves a lot more than reading books or watching videos. There is a social engagement aspect to it which you cannot replicate online. And just the fact of showing up to a physical classroom is important for motivation.
</p>

<p>
	You can't just sit behind a computer for 12 years watching videos and clicking buttons. This kind of education will produce an army of incel trolls.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org works because it's supplemental. It already assumes you've go a solid base of education to build on top of. And even so, this work would be 10x more powerful in person. But I'm not about to run a physical university for thousands of people, so videos are good enough for the stuff I teach. But even so, most people who watch me are not serious students. They just watch videos randomly and get little results. You can't compare watching videos to a serious in-classroom education. Although of course the content of my videos is more powerful than any university curriculum. The videos are good for me because they allow me to reach a lot more people than I otherwise could. But the downside is my videos will only work on those people who are serious, self-motivated, and self-disciplined. Also the stuff I teach wouldn't be acceptable in any institutional setting, so online is good for that.
</p>

<p>
	Online is a great learning platform, but only for those who are already serious about learning.
</p>

<p>
	I could not be where I am today without the great in-classroom education I got as a teen.
</p>

<p>
	Before we deal with the problem of evolving education to the next level we first have to deal with the more basic problem of providing everyone with education.
</p>

<p>
	Actually, herding billions of children into classrooms is necessary. At least at this point in our evolution. It's got some downsides, but don't forget the massive upsides.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to criticize education. But how would you make it better? And remember, your solution must scale to billions of children. So some fantasy of having children running around in the grass doing whatever they want is not gonna fly. You'd need to design a system which scales to billions of students, is better than the current one, works within realistic budget constraints, and is politically acceptable to most parents. That is a very difficult design problem. Which is why we have the current system we have.

<title>CONFUSION: JP helpful for moving into yellow?</title>

<p>
	Just keep in mind that few people are solidly Green. Many people who lean Green in theory still have huge gaps in their development in practice. They are missing healthy aspects of Blue & Orange, and might have developed Blue and Orange shadows. So in this sense there can be value in learning from quality healthy Blue & Orange sources. This can help round out one's development.
</p>

<p>
	The danger is, if your Blue and Orange sources are impure or dysfunctional (which many of them are), you will tend to adopt their dysfunctions as your own.
</p>

<p>
	If you listen to JP enough you will likely adopt his dysfunctions, confusions, and shadow. He is not a pure source of wisdom. But you can learn from impure sources. You just have to extra careful.
</p>

<p>
	In fact the best way to learn from JP would be to study his impurity. But that is NOT how most people learn from JP.
</p>

<p>
	Studying impurity is an excellent learning technique. Too bad so few people know how to do it. Studying impurity requires being able to discern God from the devil. Which few people know how to do. If you were able to discern God from the devil, you probably wouldn't need to listen to JP.
</p>

	What Actualized.org teaches you is that you shouldn't see anything as bad.
</p>

<p>
	Or more precisely, realize that "badness" is a projection of your mind. If you think a thing is bad, it becomes bad from your POV.

You need to flirt with her in those 30 second periods every day. Make her laugh and smile. Try teasing her. Then you can ask for her number.
</p>

<p>
	The first girl I dated I met this way. Except I was the one coming and going while she worked at the reception desk. She actually started to flirt with me in those 30 second windows. After two weeks of flirting I asked for her number, she happily gave it, and we went on a restaurant date.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there's no guarantee she will be open to your flirting. Or she just might have a boyfriend or husband already. Check for the wedding ring first. Then just flirt with her assuming she doesn't have a bf.

<p>
	Those aren't healthy fears. You got some toxic beliefs to drop.
</p>

<p>
	Women do not blackmail men for sleeping with them. LOL
</p>

<p>
	You are projecting your own twisted mind onto women.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you sleep with a woman enough it will get serious and she will want some commitment from you. The mistake is trying to avoid that. Rather embrace it. Or then don't sleep with her more than a few times.

<p>
	Nothing is ever wrong. But everything has consequences.
</p>

<p>
	All attachment will bring suffering. Everything that goes up must come down.
</p>

<p>
	But you can't really learn that lesson without living through it. So knock yourself out with romantic infatuation and see where it gets you.
</p>

<p>
	You'd have to be exceptionally wise and spiritually gifted to transcend such things without touching them.

</p>

<p>
	Also mind your biases and ideology.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a forum for arguing about ideology. This is a forum about reflecting on and letting go of one's ideology.
</p>

<p>
	If you keep posting with an ideological tone, you will end up banned.

<p>
	1) By having free universal care there will be far less need of emergency rooms. Right now emergency rooms are overworked because people can't afford basic preventative care. If your condition is not an emergency they can just tell you to see your doctor the next week.
</p>

<p>
	2) Leaving is not enough, you'd have to renounce your US citizenship. If you want to renouce it, go ahead. But then you forego the benefits of being an American and in a sense you literally have betrayed your own country for money. Some will do that, but most won't because they are too attached to living and doing biz in the US.

	3) Your same argument could be made for public schools. Yet schooling is the one thing that keeps humanity out of barbarism. Free college also includes vocational training programs. So if you want to get training to become a pumbler or whatever, that's covered. So free college is not just for nerds or intellectuals. No one is talking about making Harvard free. Only public universities would be free. Private ones would still cost a lot. But they would now have to compete on cost with good free public schools like UCLA, UC Berkeley, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to establish a nice baseline standard for all citizens, so nobody gets totally fucked for life, the way it happens now.

<p>
	You're not getting it.
</p>

<p>
	The how is that there is no how.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying it's impossible to know how.
</p>

<p>
	I'm saying it's possible to know exactly how, and that how is magic.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to understand any of this without some reality-shattering awakenings. Psychedelics are your best chance to understand what is being said. You are not going to understand it in your current state of consciousness.

	All that's required is for people to go out and vote.

<p>
	There's a good chance Biden will crash by the time primary voting happens. Most people are not paying attention yet. Warren and Bernie both have good chances of beating Biden.

<p>
	This is exactly how democracy should work. Lots of good candidates to choose from.

<p>
	Ironically your awakening is incomplete so long as you are trying to escape experience.

	There is a rare condition which causes some people not feel pain. Such people end up dead before adulthood.
</p>

<p>
	Pain is there to keep you from doing stupid stuff which would ruin your body. If God didn't invent pain, you'd be long since dead.

<p>
	It's a good video. Makes some good points.
</p>

<p>
	I wonder though how bad a nuclear meltdown can get, and how bad a leak of nuclear waste can be once we have a 1000x more nuclear plants.
</p>

<p>
	Chernobyl and Fukushima might be the tip of the iceberg. If some nuclear plant leaks all of its waste into the ocean, how bad would that be?

<p>
	Of course vaccines were good for mankind overall. I don't think anyone disputes that.
</p>

<p>
	The question is, how do we make them even better?
</p>

<p>
	Yes, gasoline cars were very helpful for mankind.
</p>

<p>
	But now it's time to upgrade to electric cars which should come with less harmful side effects.
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem is, even if vaccines save 10 million lives for every 1 life they destroy, if you're the mother or father of a child who will get destroyed, you're not gonna take it quietly. Statistics are no consolation when your luck runs out.
</p>

<p>
	I don't understand why all-organic vaccines can't be produced. Do we really need mercury in there? Or is that just some cost-cutting measure?
</p>

	Self-transcendence is just the final step in Maslow's pyramid. One step above self-actualization.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make self-actualization and self-transcendence at odds with one another. They work together.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, to fully actualize yourself you must fully transcend yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The first half of this journey you spend actualizing your human self.
</p>

<p>
	The second half of this journey you spend actualizing your God Self.
</p>

<p>
	#1 leads to #2. And then #2 undoes #1. It's hard to undo #1 until you do #1. Most people need a lot more work doing #1 before they can even entertain #2.

<p>
	How could God not be curious about itself?
</p>

<p>
	God is too amazing and too mysterious to not be curious about itself.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you went to sleep in your bed and then magically woke up the next day on an alien planet. You would naturally be extremely curious to explore it. You wouldn't wake up and be like, "Oh, it's just some alien planet. Boring! I'm going back to sleep." Instead you'd say, "OMG! WTF is this? Let's look around. This is amazing stuff!"

<title>The fear of being surpassed intellectually</title>

<p>
	That's a very good insight about your fear.
</p>

		<p>
			For each new insight, I feel like I'm growing and seeing things more clearly. So I feel like I can never get enough. The hunger is insatiable. But at the same time, there's this fear of not doing it. And that makes me wonder what lies on the other side. It could be growth, or it could be stagnation. It seems like I just have to take the plunge in order to find out.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But you must take it deeper. What is it about your identity which allows this fear to have any teeth at all for you?
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you've somehow made intellect an significant part of your identity (of who you think you are). So you fear losing that sense of intellectual self.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate that. Try to get more clear about it.
</p>

<p>
	And of course you know the ultimate solution here will be to surrender that intellectual self. You must bite the bullet that you will have no intellectual advantage over anyone else. At first you will resist accepting this because it will feel like a serious loss of meaning. You will feel like your life will become worse as a result. It will feel empty. But that emptiness is Truth. That emptiness is the True Self which you are avoiding. That emptiness leads to liberation.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, a big part of waking up is surrendering meaning. Especially those things in life you find most meaningful, which for you probably means the meaning which comes with intellectual pursuits and knowledge acquisition. Notice that knowledge acquisition is a subtle form of greediness and materialism. Like the businessman hoards money the intellectual hoards ideas and insights.
</p>

<p>
	Hoarding of ideas and insights must ultimately be surrendered to attain the final liberation. Because your truest Self is more empty and insubstantial than an insight or a piece of knowledge.
</p>

<p>
	Of course don't make the mistake of demonizing or rejecting insight. Just don't build an identity out of it. That's all.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment makes you realize that genetics is a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	But relatively speaking, basically everything causes epigenetic change. So that doesn't mean much.

	Hehe, after the deep topics we cover here and with psychedelics, therapy will seem like child's play.
</p>

<p>
	The only way it could work is if you find a REALLY good therapist, not the typical hack.

<title>How to conquer fear of death on psychedelics?</title>

<p>
	Obviously you guys are still too afraid.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is conquered by facing it.
</p>

<p>
	See my recent videos on fear.
</p>

<p>
	You got a lot more tripping to do and inner work to do before your mind is ready to surrender. You're in just the early stages of this work. So just keep chipping away at it.
</p>

<p>
	Try to not think of it as death so much. Death is not real. Reframe it as waking up to yourself as God. This will make it less scary.
</p>

<p>
	If you watch Part 2 you will see I said exactly that: all fear is fear of one self. Which is to say, all fear is fear of one's own mind.
</p>

<p>
	All those "external" things you fear are your own mind which you have disowned.

	Kriya yoga is good for this. It's less mental and more physical.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try using binural beats as training wheels to build yourself up.

	Philippines is a very stage Blue country. Stage Blue is too traditional and conformist to understand homosexuality. Stage Blue is very sexually repressed.

	You guys will argue about the issue for 50 years until you finally accept it as normal, just like all modern 1st world countries have done. And when you grand children look back on it, they will wonder what all the fuss was about.

<p>
	I don't have any formal practice right now. I just live life and try to be conscious.
</p>

<p>
	But this is not good advice to follow for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	Your practice will change depending on where you are in your path. So be careful comparing yourself to others. Find what you need right now.

	Nonduality is not a belief.

<p>
	Bad trips on DMT are no different really than good trips. A bad trip is nothing more than the tripper getting scared of his own shadow. If you take too much DMT too fast you will scare yourself, of course.

		<p>
			Hello.
		</p>

		<p>
			After 18 months of self-actualization which includes <em>meditation on a daily basis, reading, writing, mindfulness</em> and so forth, I still have a <u>deep</u> inner resistance when it comes to studying and trying to memorize facts.
		</p>

		<p>
			What I find strange is the fact that I can meditate pretty well and I can stay in the present moment for a long time without resistance. I have to admit that it was hard to reach this point where I can meditate everywhere, even at my work which is a pretty randy place.
		</p>

		<p>
			What bothers me is the feeling that I'll never be able to achieve a pleasant state (meaning a state of flow) when I'm studying the things that seem interesting to me.
		</p>

		<p>
			I want to be able to enjoy studying without resistance because it's very important for me to be a life-long learner. How can I become a good communicator if I'm not able to process and assimilate information very well?
		</p>

		<p>
			How many of you do have this inner resistance when studying?
		</p>

		<p>
			How many of you lack motivation when it comes to learning new stuff?
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm almost at a point of desperation and I mean that.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any suggestions to achieve a state of flow when I need to learn new information?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are getting in your own way. Your own ideals of being a good learner is precisely the thing which is tripping you up here. You are not allowing yourself to fully immerse in the flow of learning because you're too busy trying to live up to the image in your mind of being a good learner. This imagine creates all sorts of artificial requirements like memorization and other formalities which you then resist.
</p>

<p>
	Try learning in a less structured or rigid way. If you really enjoy learning, just do it. Learn in a joyful way without worrying about how that has to look. Perhaps memorization is not necessary at all. Perhaps finishing every book from cover to cover is not necessary either. Perhaps there are totally new ways to learn which you are not even allowing yourself to explore because you've got some rigid image in your mind of what learning has to look like. For example, maybe real learning might look like taking a vacation to another country and going to a bar for drinks with some new people you met, rather than sitting at home memorizing a book. Perhaps real learning is taking psychedelics in the middle of the jungle.
</p>

<p>
	As you go deeper into self-actualization work you have to find ways of doing it which feel organic and natural to you. It can't be like following some check list of mechanical rules.
</p>

<p>
	Telling yourself that "I must watch more self-help videos" will create resistance since its such a forced way of doing things.
</p>

<p>
	You must learn to listen more to your feelings rather than to your shoulds & rules. Your feeling tell you what you need to do when. But this requires getting attuned to hearing their subtle cues. For example in your case now your feelings are telling you that your method of learn is too artificial and forced, which is why you're frustrated.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I forced you to have sex every day and if you didn't have sex at the times I wanted you to, in the exact ways I wanted you to, I would give you a strong electric shock. This would quickly take all the joy out of sex. After a few months of this you'd start to hate the idea of sex.

<p>
	The democrats HAVE found ground and they have made a ton of serious policy proposals. Trump has no serious policy proposals other than anti-immigrant ones.

<p>
	Don't be making false equivalencies.

<p>
	The democrats have some of the best and most progressive candidates running in the history of the US. What more do you want? George Washington to crawl out of his grave and join the democratic debates? As soon as he learns about Trump he would crawl back into his grave and stay there.
</p>

<p>
	If people are stupid enough to vote for Trump a second time, nothing can save us. That ain't the democrats fault.

	How do you know? What if it is?

<p>
	What if your body is imaginary? How would you tell the difference if all you've ever experienced your whole life has been imagination?

<p>
	What if the very thing you think is real has always just been something you've been imagining to be real?
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine a thing to be real, does that mean it is real? Or is it still imaginary?
</p>

<p>
	How would you distinguish between you imagining something to be real vs it actually being real?

	It's not a challenge. I have always recommended moderate dosing of psychedelics.

I saw a while ago you betting someone that Bernie would win the election, and I feel silly for saying this but this is what I've been basing the last few months of my political analysis around.

<p>
	It's certainly possible that Warren steals his votes.
</p>

<p>
	I see a big problem with Warren and Bernie splitting the progressive votes, giving Biden the nomination.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind that it's too early right now. Polls don't mean much yet.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie will win the election against Trump. But will he even get to face Trump? That's a big IF. Biden and Warren are both stronger than I hoped in the polls.
</p>

<p>
	When I endorsed Bernie I didn't even know Biden would run. I was hoping he wouldn't. Biden really has no business running in this election. He's clearly just doing it because he's got nothing better to do.

<p>
	The desire to manipulate reality to suit yourself is the very definition of ego.
</p>

<p>
	But also, you are able to bend many rules as you become more conscious. You just have to appreciate that your personal human desires are not what governs the universe. There is a deep intelligence to how everything is arranged, so think twice before imposing your human ideas on how the universe should be.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe one day you'll discover that everything is perfect exactly how it is and that nothing needs to be manipulated. Imagine that! What a concept!

<p>
	You're highly unlikely to start a million dollar startup if it's not something you love. You will quit long before reaching your first million.

			As I said before, he promised to help the Native American community in Grassy Narrows, deal with the problem of Mercury poisoning while he was campaigning. But he hasn't done anything of the sort. 
		</p>

		<p>
			And when a Native Canadian confronted him about it at a high dollar fundraiser and talked about people's children being poisoned and not having anything to drink, he sarcastically deflected and made a joke and thanked her for her donation which brought jeers and laughter in the rest of the room.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, he's very big on cultural appropriation. Like, every time he visits a different country, he wears a very costume-y depiction of that culture. It's actually quite comical to see how campy he makes it.

	I wouldn't call that racist. Politics is tricky and many politicians aren't able to keep their promises for reasons other than racism.
</p>

<p>
	Wearing costumes when abroad is fairly typical for leaders.
</p>

<p>
	Racism is a pretty serious charge that requires solid evidence.
