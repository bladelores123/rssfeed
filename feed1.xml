<p>
	I have no idea. I have not heard anything negative. I assumed Charlie was happy with it. But who knows.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, his Orange audience will turn on him if he goes too far into Turquoise/mysticism. They will eat him alive. So these types of interview could earn him some backlash. Anyone who associates with my ideas too much will face backlash from normies: "How dare you invite his lunatic to your show! I trusted you."

	You answered your own question.

<p>
	Selfish people hold political positions which serve them personally the most.

<p>
	That's only one factor. Another factor is that they are selfish and self-biased, which means they vote only based on what personally serves them.
</p>

<p>
	A stage Orange person's worldview is commonly all about unchecked capitalism. The more she benefits from unchecked capitalism and materialism the more that worldview will feel true and real.
</p>

<p>
	Jenner is entitled and materialistic as fuck. Of course she doesn't care about helping poor people by deconstructing capitalism. Her entire run for gov is just a personal publicity stunt, like Kanye West and Trump. That's how these people operate. They don't give a fuck about actually doing good governance. To them this job is a way to be famous and grift off the fame.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course Infinite Self-Understanding.
</p>

<p>
	I would say the biggest thing is that your consciousness becomes "Absolutized". By which I mean, everything you are conscious of is seen as existing absolutely and eternally. For example, right now as I type this and look at my hands, I know for a fact that my hands are Absolute. My hands exist for Eternity. My hands are God's hands. I exist Eternally and I will never die.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't claim to be above Jesus. I am Jesus and everything else in the Universe.
</p>

<p>
	When you fully awaken you will realize that performing miracles is unnecessary because that assumes reality isn't already perfect. If you assume for a minute that reality as you see it is and has always been absolutely perfect, then the idea that you should interfere with the flow of reality in order to manipulate it with miracles can be seen as a delusion. It's ego who thinks that miracles ought to be performed because ego is unable to see that what is already the case is perfect. Ego actually believes it can improve reality, which is pure hogwash. You can't make reality any more perfect than God has. This is the core arrogance and delusion of the ego. The ego wants powers to manipulate reality to suit itself. But God-realization is the death of that ego. The ego does not end up with special powers. The ego is killed so deeply that it never even existed.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, actually you're very wrong about that.
</p>

<p>
	If you actually became infinitely conscious you would realize that making the state permanent is an egoic desire and that you do not want the state to be permanent precisely because God-mode is so boring. You didn't become a human by accident. You decided to become a human because it was in the higher Good and because you are playing an Eternal game of hide and seek.
</p>

<p>
	You think you want infinite power, but once you get it, you will realize that existence becomes totally meaningless and pointless. And thus you will decide to lower your state of consciousness -- to fall asleep -- so that you could struggle to awaken again.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot awaken without falling asleep. And God cannot be all-powerful unless it is capable of putting itself to sleep. God definitely puts itself to sleep and this is not a fault or error within God. It is the very structure of what God is. God is an infinite dreamer. God is not just the highest state of consciousness, God is all lower states of consciousness too!
</p>

<p>
	Your idea is to lock God down into the highest state of consciousness. But this is precisely a mistake which would limit Infinite Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is you do not understand what you're asking for because you are not infinitely consciousness. If you dislike the lower states, you misunderstand God. You are not understanding the depth of the Love because your ego is still biased and selfish. You only want the highest love, not the lowest. But Absolute LOVE must include the lowest.

	I don't even know if I want to at this rate because there is no benefit in it for me when people are so set on misunderstanding what is said.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a projection nightmare.
</p>

<p>
	These ideas will only make sense to the right audience. I cannot take a room full of clueless, closedminded materialists and convince them of anything spiritual. To attempt such feats is an exercise in stupidity and demeaning to my intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	That's what's called casting pearls before swine.

			let the conversation simply go wherever it goes.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's exactly what makes a conversation confusing.
</p>

<p>
	If I let the conversation just go anywhere, nothing would be understood at all. Letting someone pepper you with random questions about God is a recipe for disaster.
</p>

<p>
	Let me try to pepper you with random rapid-fire questions like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Does God exist?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do you know?
	</li>
	<li>
		But what if you're deluded?
	</li>
	<li>
		But what if you're hallucinating?
	</li>
	<li>
		Prove it to me
	</li>
	<li>
		But science says there is no God
	</li>
	<li>
		But science says your enlightenment experiences are just brain activity
	</li>
	<li>
		If God exists, why did the Holocaust happen?
	</li>
	<li>
		What if truth is just pragmatism?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These questions cannot just be asked casually in conversation.
</p>

<p>
	You can't be like, "Relax, just have a casual conversation, bro. Don't worry about anything."
</p>

<p>
	And then be like, "Bro! You didn't explain God in a slam-dunk way like you do in a 3 hr prepared lecture."
</p>

<p>
	A casual conversation meanders and explains little.
</p>

<p>
	If anything I'm getting criticized for being too casual. I was just having a pleasant conversation with Charlie. I was not trying to build a rock solid case for anything. This was not some logical proof I was constructing. He asked me random questions and I answered them with awareness to how my answers would trigger normie defenses. I was not nervous or tense at all. These kind of talks are very easy for me personally. The problem is that a casual convo will not explain Truth to any normie listening in.
</p>

<p>
	If you ask me for a random example of a scientific paradigm change, and I respond with Einstein, this will tell you nothing about why science is fundamentally misguided.
</p>

			<strong>The first law of survival is NOT breathing.</strong> Our bodies allows us to run away from predators and to quickly react to immediate dangers without breathing for a very short time using ATP (our anaerobic system), which is more important to saving our lives and our immediate safety (1st law) than physiological needs (such as food, water, or <strong>breathing</strong>). That is why IMMEDIATE SAFETY (amygdala hijack) is the 1st sub-law of the first law of social fabrics. Eventually, breathing, water, and other physiological needs become essential to LIFE, but not to its <u>immediate</u> safety.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, that assumes you've already got enough air to hold you over. Which means you were breathing to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	But anyway, there's not much point splitting hairs about this. These low level needs are obvious and no one is disputing them. And their precise order is irrelevant since your body handles that stuff for you automatically anyway. It knows the order you need when. The order is gonna be contextual too. You are not going to drink water if you know there's a crocodile right where you drink.

	When Ramana Maharshi got cancer his followers tried to get doctors to come look at him to heal him. His response was something along the lines of: "Who cares? It's just a body."
</p>

<p>
	When you are that awake you literally don't give a fuck about anything. No condition of life is better than any other.
</p>

<p>
	An fully awakened person cannot die. He is conscious forever, regardless of what happens to his body. So losing the body makes no difference.

<p>
	That's the catch-22 of this business.
</p>

<p>
	On the one hand you guys want me out there talking to people on normie shows.
</p>

<p>
	Then when those normies fail to understand anything or run amok, then you say: Look what you did, Leo!
</p>

<p>
	Pick what you want: 1) Do you want normies to know about God, or 2) Do you not?
</p>

<p>
	If you want normies to know about God, then realize that they will fuck it up badly, as they have for the last 2000 years. Or if you don't, then stop telling me that I should go on Joe Rogan and such.
</p>

<p>
	How do you imagine Joe Rogan fans will react to what I teach? They will think I'm insane and they will blame Rogan for having me on. That's how normies react to Truth. I can't fix that. There is no way to make Actualized.org a mainstream accepted teaching. That expectation deeply misunderstands the depth of the epistemic quagmire society is in.
</p>

<p>
	God cannot be mainstreamed. Not unless you completely pervert it into falsehood.

<p>
	There are many degrees of awakening and consciousness. Consciousness can expand or contract without any limitations. How do you think you got unwoke in the first place? If consciousness could not contract, you could not awaken because you'd already be woke and spirituality would not exist since you would be fully conscious that you're God at all times. You also could not be human. You can only be ignorant of things because your consciousness is contracted. Uncontracted consciousness is absolutely omniscient. If you are not aware of how you created every hair on your ass, your consciousness must be contracted. Since you create everything.
</p>

<p>
	Do you honestly think that God does not know how it created the hairs on your ass? If no, you're underestimating God. If yes, then you've separated yourself from God.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not omniscient you are not fully conscious. It's just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	That is not possible because without addressing the confusions and defense mechanisms it will not penetrate the mind.

<p>
	It may feel that way to you, but if you listen to the entire thing, I answered all his questions. It just took some time.

<p>
	If you ask me a question like, "What are the problems of science?" or "How important were psychedelics in your life?", there is no quick way to answer that such that a normie would get it.

			I noticed that you were a lot less explanatory and in depth in this interview than in your usual videos.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Because it is impossible. Charlie would not know what questions to ask in what order to get something like one of my videos.
</p>

<p>
	This is why I rarely do conversations with people. The interviewer does not know the depth of what he is asking. We waste most of the time clearing up confusions and defense mechanisms. To get a conversation as substantial as one of my videos the interviewer would need have a depth of consciousness and knowledge that I have. Such people nearly do not exist. And if they do, they don't have massive YT channels or general audiences.
</p>

<p>
	There is a fundamental limitation in explaining these topics to a general, causal stage Orange audience. No amount of skill can overcome that limitation. The best that can be done is a bit better. But it will never be some homerun that leads to some profound awakening. Conversation is not suited to this work. Which is why I generally avoid it. If I want to explain something serious, having a person asking me question is actually an obstacle.
</p>

<p>
	My videos are as dense and direct as things can get short of a book. Any conversation I have will be less dense because it will meander around and devolve into an infinite chain of follow up question.
</p>

<p>
	Conversations are not lectures. They are just random questions. Imagine trying to learn calculus with little mathematical experience by asking random questions for 2 hours. It's impossible. It would all sound like word salad and woo-woo.
</p>

<p>
	I have spent more time studying these issues than you spent years learning mathematics. And you still suck at math.
</p>

<p>
	And I consider Charlie a good stage Yellow interviewer. Just imagine how bad it would get if I was speaking to a defensive Tier 1 person like Richard Dawkins. It would get real bad. And that's exactly as it should be, because the interviewer and his audience are playing a game of defending their constructions of reality.
</p>

<p>
	What is not understood by people is that a conversation is never a genuine inquiry into truth. Truth cannot be reached via conversation, ever. Because the person you are talking to does not even exist but in your own mind.
</p>

<p>
	If you were conscious of the truth you would not be having a conversation in the first place. Conversations are for entertainment, not truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you expect my podcast appearances to deliver you some epic deep understanding, you should drop that fantasy now because it won't happen. The format does not allow that. If you want some deep understanding of anything I talk about you'll need 10 hrs minimum. Just to understand Spiral Dynamics takes at least 20 hours of study. And that's way easier to understand than something like science or God.
</p>

<p>
	My only frustration is not enough time.
</p>

<p>
	I enjoyed the conversation. These kind of conversations are very easy for me. The problem is dumbing it down to a level the audience can follow. Dumbing it down in the right way takes a lot of skill and I still need to get better at that.

<p>
	The problem is that the questions Charlie asked were so deep it would require a 5 hr conversation.
</p>

<p>
	Something like deconstructing science just cannot be done in 60 minutes because there are too many defense mechanisms to address.
</p>

<p>
	Deconstructing science would take at least 5 hrs. And we talked about a lot more topics than that.
</p>

<p>
	Each topic Charlie asked about is a 5 hr conversation.
</p>

<p>
	This is the difficulty of talking about this stuff in a casual way to a general audience who has zero foundation in metaphysics or epistemology. It is like trying to explain calculus to an audience who never even learned arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
	Charlie's audience is gonna be very stage Orange so they will be extremely skeptical of anyone who questions science. That is a huge red flag in their mind. Because if science can be deconstructed their whole reality collapses and that is totally unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why my videos are so long.
</p>

			i posted this on another thread but it makes way more sense here
		</p>

		<p>
			you have no idea what infinite existence, or 'complete God-realization' truly is
		</p>

		<p>
			how could you possibly ever know when it's 'complete'
		</p>

		<p>
			you've experienced a microscopic degree of self-awareness of infinite existence (and i mean micro-fucking-scopic), but you have no idea how deep infinite existence really goes, or even what it actually is
		</p>

		<p>
			there's estimated to be 10,000 stars for every grain of sand on earth, or for a better analogy 100 billion - 200 billion galaxies, and you've just experienced the strongest psychedelic on 1 tiny planet out of all these galaxies, but think of all the psychedelics that could exist, or what other species that could have developed who may have a much better understanding due to the nature of their species, or the different conditions in which they could have developed over time
		</p>

		<p>
			we have no idea how aware of the source they could have become, because there are an infinite number of conditions that we do not know that could have enabled them to have greater self-awareness of it
		</p>

		<p>
			when you did those 13 5-MeO trips, you experienced a microscopic degree of self-awareness of infinite existence, and then when you did the 30 trips, you experienced a microscopic degree more self-awareness, but you still have no idea of how deeply self-aware of infinite existence you could become
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>the fact that there's a disparity at all is all the evidence you need to tell you that you don't know</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			your glimpses of self-transcendence don't mean you have any idea of what's really going on, and anyone on this forum who thinks they do really doesn't appreciate the infinity of infinity, and is deceiving themselves in thinking they do
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	You don't understand.
</p>

<p>
	All of that is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	I became Infinitely Conscious. Which means I become absolutely conscious of everything. That's what it means to be God.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not conscious how you designed the whole universe, you aren't really awake.
</p>

<p>
	What I am talking about is beyond anything your mind can fathom and beyond anything any spiritual teaching has told you.
</p>

<p>
	My idea of what's going on is 100% Absolute. I am trying to guide you to that, most of you refuse to listen.
</p>

	Sounds like your mental stability is lacking. In which case dail back the psychedelics.

<p>
	Psychedelics require very solid mental stability or they become dangerous.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I've had many different kinds and degrees of awakening using different methods.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT certainly helps. But even that by itself is not enough. It took me over 130 awakenings to reach what I would call complete God-realization. Once you reach this point it's very easy to see who is not God-realized. Most spiritual teachers are not God-realized. This especially includes all the Buddhists, neo-Advaitans, every meditation teacher, and every New Ager. None of it is deep enough. Not even in the same ballpark.

<p>
	I became totally omniscient. I became completely conscious of how I create reality.
</p>

<p>
	This is not anything the human mind can comprehend or reason about. And it is beyond anything possible to achieve with meditation, Buddhism, self-inquiry, or anything like that.
</p>

<p>
	Even nonduality is not omniscience. It is way less.

</p>

<p>
	You need to get serious about epistemology and stop believing anyone. Don't believe me either.
</p>

<p>
	Seeking truth is not a matter of belief. And you will NEVER get truth from human words. The problem is that you want to get to the truth through words, whether the Bible or mine. And none of that will work.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to reach truth, you must question everything until your mind collapses.

<p>
	Goodness is the realization that there is no difference between anything.
</p>

<p>
	You fail to understand rape and murder because you have actually convinced yourself that there is a difference between life and death, pleasure and suffering.
</p>

<p>
	These differences are imaginary. When you realize this, you will realize Absolute Good.
</p>

<p>
	When you surrender all biases, literally nothing can be bad.
</p>

<p>
	"Badness" IS bias.

	Even if you are acting evil, you're still doing it out of a twisted sense of what is good.
</p>

<p>
	The problem isn't that some people are good and some are evil. The problem is that good is relativistic, which leads to some fucked up scenarios where someone like Hitler is actually doing good from his twisted worldview.
</p>

<p>
	This is a problem of perspective.
</p>

<p>
	But also you should note that Hitler was often nice in person, had good manners, and even loved his dog and so on. If Hitler saw an old German lady struggling to cross the road, and there was no one else around, he would probably gladly help her across just to feel good about himself.
</p>

<p>
	Another example: a mass shooter thinks he's doing good for the world by shooting people. If your worldview is one in which you see mankind as evil and cancerous, shooting them suddenly becomes good.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly some people are more positive vs negative via genetic predisposition and brain chemistry. Some people are prone to depression, nihilism, self-hatred, etc. But these are all twisted up forms of consciousness. Such consciousness can be rehabilitated or straightened out. But it tends to be very labor intensive.

<title>Not investing into stock market</title>

<p>
	I don't want people to invest in things just because I do. Investing requires very careful thinking and strategy.
</p>

<p>
	But I don't think BitCoin is a bad investment, fundamentally. The problem is that people have hyped it up so much lately that you have to be careful not to have it crash on your head.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be extremely careful buying anything that is hyped up and at its peak. That's a very reliable way of losing money. You want to be first into an investment, not last.
</p>

<p>
	But who knows? BitCoin may well reach a $10 trillion market cap.
</p>

<p>
	Investing for me is also a lot easier/less risky because I have money to lose. Many of you guys don't. I would not invest my only $10,000 in something like BitCoin. But if you have $500k in cash and a decent salary, maybe you could place $100k in BitCoin.
</p>

<p>
	I tend to be a very conservative investor.
</p>

You are God imaging the world.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the most effective way. It's very hard to reach God-consciousness through meditation. If you want to do it that way, you'll have to do it very hardcore, like a full-time job. And even then there's no guarantees.
</p>

<p>
	Ween yourself off your meds and experiment with low dose psychedelics. That would be the quickest way for you to get a glimpse.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously don't do psychedelics if you are mentally unstable.
</p>

<p>
	We are done with Connor's antics on this forum. Do not post his stuff here any more.
</p>

<p>
	It is an immature and harmful disgrace to genuine spiritual work. This is all the stuff I warn about with Zen devilry. It is not a good example to follow and it gives spirituality a bad image.
</p>

<p>
	I have tried to reason with Connor about this but he refuses to listen and doubles down on his antics. No more of that shit here.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not a license to act like madman. Just remember that for when you awaken and get ideas to act out like a jackass.

<p>
	Because survival requires being a jerk sometimes. And mostly all you care about is survival so you like people who are capable of what you care about most.
</p>

<p>
	But also don't get it lopsided. As much as people love jerks, they love sweetness even more. Which is why gurus and cults fool you the most with sweetness and love bombing.
</p>

<p>
	In the end what you're most attracted to is Love. Which is why love is the most alluring bait in a trap.

<p>
	If that happened then a pig did not run in front of you.

<p>
	That is still a state of consciousness, just a hazy one, and what you're conscious of is different/less clear than otherwise. In that case, what exists is hazy stuff. There may be parts of a tree there, or maybe not. Depends on how hazy it is. Maybe the tree exists there more like a vague sense of treeness or thingness rather than a sharp picture of a tree.

<p>
	For me one meal a day is too little and creates energy/thermal problems. That's how my metabolism is. Yours is probably different.
</p>

<p>
	I do best on two meals a day.
</p>

<p>
	Stop following diets in the abstract sense and find what works for you specifically. Nothing matters unless it works FOR YOU. Whether it works for others is irrelevant.

<p>
	There are few situations in which you're not conscious of your visual field. So your example is highly artificial. You're basically describing blindness. For a blind person colors don't exist. Obviously.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	The entire visual field is consciousness. EVERYTHING is consciousness. Consciousness is not just what you see in your mind's eye.
</p>

<p>
	In the case above, both the tree and the ice cream is what exists. The tree is what you see. The ice cream is what you see in your mind's eye: it is a thought of ice cream. Here you must distinguish between an ice cream held in your hand vs the thought of ice cream.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference in existence between a physical object and a thought of a physical object -- they both exist equally. But thoughts and physical objects behave differently. It is their difference in behavior that tricks you.

<p>
	That's how style is. You can't please everyone. Spicy things are polarizing, making some people hate it and others love it. I'm a somewhat polarizing guy. I don't want to make milquetoast content that makes your grandma pleased. My content has added drama and flair to make it interesting. And I enjoy being provocative.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, I'm never angry at you. Mostly I'm baffled by the stupidity and laziness of people. I am in constant disbelief at how much the average person takes life/reality for granted, and therefore it's hard for me to respect such a person. So I tend to look down on such people and sometimes I rant and rebuke from that perspective, but I'm never too serious about it. Half the time it's done tongue -in-cheek.
</p>

<p>
	When I rant at you, it's because you're not being serious enough about reality. That's mostly where I'm coming from. To earn my respect you have to be serious.

<p>
	And that is what makes classical chess inferior.
</p>

<p>
	The essence of chess is pure strategy and wit. In the ideal chess game no move is made from memory or prior calculation. The ideal chess game would wipe your memory of all prior chess games between games.
</p>

<p>
	People are sheep and they just play whatever games they are given without every thinking deeply about how to improve the game and accentuate its essence. Classical chess is not as great as it could be. The game could be made way more interesting if people were less dogmatic about it.
</p>

<p>
	Even in chess, lack of openmindedness is a problem.

<p>
	I'm not rude per se, I just have low interest in human bullshit.

<p>
	I'm not your mommy. I'm not gonna play social games with you. I'm here to deliver ideas, nothing more.

	If you want someone to coddle you, you can find plenty of those kind of teachers around. My teachings are meant to be edgy and brutal. That's my style. At least for now. Maybe in the future it will soften up.

<p>
	Vitamin D deficiency is the most common supplement/vitamin deficiency people have.
</p>

<p>
	Vitamin D is also one of the most important vitamins for overall health and immune function.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be a fool not to test for it and take it.

</p>

<p>
	If you want a good way to handicap yourself in chess games, make sure you play Fischer Random Chess:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fischer_random_chess</a>
</p>

<p>
	Basically any chess game that is not Fischer Random Chess is bullshit and not true chess -- since mostly it tests your memorization of opening moves. Which a monkey could do if trained enough hours.
</p>

<p>
	Fischer Random Chess is where a real man proves himself.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. The best way to win at Meta Chess is to stab your opponent in the heart with a knife. If he's a true meta thinker he will appreciate the irony. Gotta think outside the box <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<title>Objection over 'does a water bottle exist when i leave the room'</title>

<p>
	All you have to do to know what is true is to look at what is literally true in your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	It's that simple.
</p>

<p>
	Things are exactly what they are, not what you think they are. Stop thinking that things are somehow other than what you see.
</p>

<p>
	The chief delusion of man is thinking things are somehow more than they appear. Appearance is exact. Meanwhile your mind is full of shit.
</p>

<p>
	If you see half a bottle, that's what exists: half a fucking bottle. If you don't see a bottle, that's what exists: no bottle. Stop thinking there's anything more.

<p>
	I wish I could give you some easy normie technique. Unfortunately I think the only way is to Awaken. Deeply awaken until you actually become Infinity. You need to actually break through in consciousness to that Infinity state and bask in it. The more you bask in it the more it will dissolve your samskaras, limited identifications, attachments, and impurities.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately this requires HARDCORE spiritual practice. An hour per day is not going to cut it.
</p>

<p>
	A more normie technique I've been toying with is simply just visualizing yourself every day as being the entire Universe, as being Everything. I think that if you do that every day for months and years it should start to rewire your old human self image to align with that of God. But I don't think this alone will be enough unless you also do it very hardcore, many hours per day, like a kind of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	The plain truth is that I've always been kind of a jerk, and as I become more conscious and more authentic I can be even more jerk-like because I care less about what others want me to be.
</p>

<p>
	The nice thing about waking up is that it trims off all the social pretense. Some people are just jerks. Not everyone is gonna be a carebear. To equate that with consciousness is silly.
</p>

<p>
	I will be exactly how I feel like and I don't care if you like it. If you want me to be sweet to you, that's your problem. My work has nothing to do with me being sweet or likeable.
</p>

<p>
	My authentic personality is just no-bullshit, blunt like hammer, straight to business.

<p>
	That's like asking why some people smoke crack or jump out of air planes or go to war or use condoms.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is a very sophisticated business. It is not merely biological reproduction of offspring.
</p>

<p>
	They don't necessarily choose to be gay as a survival strategy, rather they are born with gay desires and their survival includes satisfying those desires.

	I have never liked politeness. It's fake and it lulls you into buying bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	Gurus say polite things to you and you get intoxicated with their sweetness.

<p>
	If I was sweeter it would just make you bigger sheep.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Deep awakening will make you more authentic, secure, charismatic, masculine, feminine, and playful. It will dissolve much fear too. Which is very effective for pickup.
</p>

<p>
	But it will not give you technical skills nor experience with women -- which is also very important for results. For example, you will still not know how to escalate, handle logistics, or close.
</p>

<p>
	If you think pickup is difficult and scary, awakening is way more difficult and scary. If you can't muster the balls to approach a girl, you won't be awakening any time soon.
</p>

<title>New Video: Is Masculine / Feminine also a construct?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/65227-new-video-is-masculine-feminine-also-a-construct/?do=findComment&amp;comment=892458</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Beyond all social construction are constructions of Consciousness itself.
</p>

<p>
	Feminine and masculine are imaginings of Consciousness, similar to how pain, time, space, birth, death, and memories are. This is a much deeper level of construction than social construction. A human ego does not have access to these levels of construction and therefore takes them as "reality". The ego simply defines as "real" that which is outside its control, while assuming that its sphere of control is all that's possible.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, every form is held and constructed by Consciousness. This includes all social constructions like money, gender, math, science, atoms, etc. Social construction is a small sub-set of Consciousness holding forms. Talking about social construction is really just a poor substitute for those who are not conscious enough to be aware of how Consciousness holds all forms.
</p>

<p>
	If you could grasp how Consciousness holds forms -- this would be the key that answers everything. To put it simply, Consciousness dreams up any forms it wants: time, space, money, gender, atoms, science, numbers, words, people, etc. and then it holds them. Until it drops them.
</p>

<p>
	Humans have something like masculine and feminine orientations.
</p>

<p>
	But to essentialize masculine and feminine and treat them as though they apply across the universe is not correct I think. Some spiritual folk love to do that. As if consciousness is limited to such a narrow dichotomy.
</p>

<p>
	A rock is not masculine nor feminine and an alien could be some other thing altogether.

<p>
	Fairness and balance are far more naunced issues than you want to believe.
</p>

<p>
	Genuine fairness is exactly what is aimed at. But getting there requires corrective measures and address past inequalities.
</p>

<p>
	You are not being intelligent about this because your mind is biased. When you resist and begurdge every corrective measure it betrays your lack of interest in genuine fairness.

<p>
	Cultural beauty norms are.

<p>

<p>
	When you fully awaken you will realize that absolutely everything is infinitely and equally beautiful. You will discover Absolute Beauty and it will make you feel so stupid for not seeing it sooner.

Last time I watched he said he went from materialsm to dualism as his metaphysical position and ranted about that for an hour. He does have some open conversations from time to time, maybe you can get him to a next step :^)

<title>Objection over 'does a water bottle exist when i leave the room'</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/65220-objection-over-does-a-water-bottle-exist-when-i-leave-the-room/?do=findComment&amp;comment=891942</link>

<p>
	You're just confused about your own notions of existence and perception and self.
</p>

<p>
	Existence doesn't have a definition. It is what is. It's the only thing there is. And it cannot be defined because a definition itself must exist to do any work.
</p>

<p>
	The bottle exists because you imagine it does, whether you are in the room or not you imagine it, thereby creating it.
</p>

<p>
	You are imagining there is a universe outside your house. And that's how it feels to you.
</p>

<p>
	If you became more conscious you would instantly realize that you are imagining objects existing outside your field of view, like the Earth.
</p>

<title>Lofty ideas about the relativity of identity -Leo video</title>

<p>
	All Goodness in life hinges on exquisite balance. This is true of change and not-change alike. Too much change is dangerous and so is too little. How do you tell exactly how much change is best? Through consciousness and selflessness. The more conscious you are, the more selfless you are, the more exquisitely intelligent your balance becomes.
</p>

<p>
	Everything I say requires a deep, organic conscious intelligence. Otherwise it becomes evil.
</p>

<p>
	God is infinitely intelligent balance. The whole Universe is balanced on the thinest razer's edge.
</p>

<p>
	Your flipping around ignores historical context and is a doubling down on your petiness.
</p>

<p>
	Women have been suppressed for much of human history. And the only reason they aren't so much in America today is due to 100 years of vocal feminist action.
</p>

<p>
	So the situation is not at all symmetrical as you would feign.
</p>

<p>
	The majority of women around the world are discriminated against and suppressed still. When you realize this maybe you'll start to sing a different tune.
</p>

<p>
	Take a look at how entitled you are.

<p>
	I criticize Zen and Christianity and JP at times. But I don't hold a strawman of Zen or Christianity. I have always acknowledged the core validity of those teachings. Christianity just happens to be exceptionally corrupt.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I said that Zen is all just intellectual ideas that do not lead to truth. That would be akin to what Sadhguru said about Vedanta.
</p>

<p>
	Criticizing stuff is not the same as strawmanning it. I can also present a steelman case for JP and conservativism.

<p>
	Again, why are you so insecure that you begrudge treating women a bit better?
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you say, it always comes back to that.
</p>

<p>
	It's just pettiness. If you were secure you would not mind if women were treated a bit better. Ironically you've weaponized "equality" as an extension of your insecurity and smallness.
</p>

<p>
	When a secure person gets overcharged 5 cents, he lets it go. When an insecure person gets overcharged 5 cents, he starts a crusade for "fairness".

<p>
	Those ideas of freedom can apply to something like DMT entities or aliens.
</p>

<p>
	Freedom requires massive consciousness and responsibility. Your average libertarian is not even emotionally mature enough to take responsibility for racism, sexism, or capitalistic exploitation. He can't even take responsibility for paying taxes, for fuck's sake. This is not freedom, this is a child whining about not getting his candy.

</p>

<p>
	What is the genuine good intent behind feminism? What is the spirit of feminism? That's what you should contemplate deeply and grasp. Once you grasp that, then you can do some deconstruction and critique of its excesses, keeping in mind that nearly all social movements have excesses. If you don't like the excesses of feminism how about the excesses of toxic masculinity and patriarchy? Don't just conveniently forget about those.
</p>

<p>
	Make a distinction between criticizing feminism from below vs from above. The kind of stuff JP does is from below. He has not integrated it properly and is therefore reacting against his own shadow on behalf of his fan base.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, notice when you are reacting to shit like an animal, and stop it.
</p>

<p>
	A) Stop listening to JP.
</p>

<p>
	B) Go read some feminist books.
</p>

<p>
	C) Check your biases.
</p>

<p>
	Feminism is about about women overtaking them. Feminism is about women being treated on par with men.
</p>

<p>
	Women were not allowed to get a bank loan until the 1970s without a man's permission.
</p>

<p>
	Just think about that.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you so insecure that you are bothered by women getting a little bit better treatment?
</p>

<p>
	I have also said I am open to investing in stocks.
</p>

<p>
	What I am against is daytrading and using stocks as a get rich quick scheme.
</p>

<p>
	For me stocks are a good inflation hedge. Since the gov is printing so much cash I feel somewhat justified placing my cash in stocks. I don't like my savings just being eaten away.

<p>
	Yes, it can be dangerous if you spiral downward into madness by yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But don't forget, being social can be very dangerous as you spiral downward into collective madness.
</p>

<p>
	People. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't.

<p>
	He is badly misleading his audience about what Vedanta is.

<p>

<p>
	All of that could be the case, and none of that equals gender.
</p>

<p>
	As I told you earlier but you refused to consider for even a minute: "your dick and my vagina" is a set of distinctions you invented. My dick is as much yours as your vagina. There is no line between them. You just choose to imagine that line.
</p>

<p>
	You -- Preety -- have 3.5 billion dicks that you have disowned so that you could call yourself a woman.
</p>

<p>
	How many dicks do you think God has? And who do you think you are?

<title>Is gender a social construct?</title>

<p>
	That begs the question since you project those categories.
</p>

<p>
	The question is prior to the categories. You can't ask the question and then assume the categories are true. The question is asking you to consider whether the categories are mind-constructed. You are not doing that. You're just assuming they are not.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	Again, you are begging the question.
</p>

<p>
	If gender is a social construct, then gender is not needed to produce offspring.
</p>

<p>
	"Leo" is my socially constructed name. If Leo is erased, that does not mean I cannot produce offspring.

<p>
	Again, begging the question.
</p>

<p>
	By "identify" what you really mean is "invent" or "project".
</p>

<p>
	Even "parent" is an invention. You could look at the situation and conclude that the Earth is the parent.

<p>
	Is there?
</p>

<p>
	That's your projection. Animals do not understand such things.
</p>

<p>
	Acting out in ways YOU have classified as male-female does not make an animal male or female.
</p>

<p>
	As always, YOU are the one drawing these definitions as part of how you construct your reality.
</p>

<p>
	YOU do it, but then deny you did it so that it can feel more real for you.
</p>

<p>
	There's not even such a fucking thing as an "animal". You invented "animal" in order to make yourself feel "human".
</p>

<p>
	You invented the line between you and an animal, you and a male/female, you and everything else. You and your lines are bullshit. When you gotta realize that? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Go look at a dick or vagina on your phone. Then realize that is your dick and your vagina equally. Both are literally yours. You are the one who imagines that a dick on your phone is not you. And this imagination is the ego.
</p>

<p>
	You see? Somewhere in your early childhood you bought into the silly idea that a dick must be attached to your body in order for it to be yours. You never questioned how absurd that idea was. You just accepted it like a gullible fool. It never occurred to you that every dick on the planet is yours.

<title>Sadhguru's view on Advaita Vedanta</title>

<p>
	It's just a mockery of Vedanta that could only impress someone dumb enough to hang on Sadhguru's every word -- which most of his followers do.
</p>

<p>
	Of course those lashes are Maya. That's the point.
</p>

<p>
	Vedanta is not a belief system. It is a path towards realization of Maya and then liberation from it. If you aren't liberated from it then your embodiment and consciousness is weak and you have not actualized Vedanta. This is not Vedanta's fault.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru's characterization of Vedanta is very uncharitable. It would be like if I characterized Sahdguru's teachings as a cult of bending oneself into pretzels.
</p>

<p>
	You can save money by buying used cameras and mics on eBay or craigslist.
</p>

<p>
	You definitely need a good external mic.
</p>

<p>
	The nice thing about this equipment is that you can always resell it if you don't end up needing it. It holds its value pretty well.
</p>

<p>
	You can find some real deals on heavily used/refurbished gear if you wait around and shop around.

</p>

<p>
	The entire self-help section is filled with books by others helping themselves by helping you by teaching you how you can help yourself by helping others help themselves to help others help themselves by helping others. <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<p>
	Your question would make a lot more sense if you asked: Can you be happy and not fully enlightened?
</p>

<p>
	If you can't be happy with full enlightenment then you truly are fucked and there is no God.

<p>
	I think that if you grasp it deeply enough you can say it has a limit. It's infinitely empty and you've sorta plumbed the depths of it to the point where there's nothing more to do with it because it has no qualities whatsoever. So it's rather simple at that point.
</p>

<p>
	But still, many people have not grasped it deeply enough. Most people have glimpses of it.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it like the difference between counting down from a random number to zero vs counting up from a random number to infinity. It's easier to count down to zero because zero is the bottom floor. But there is no upper floor. Zero has that sort of special quality to it of being so empty that you can't get any less than zero. So you could say that zero is a natural limit. Whereas counting upward has no natural limit.

			From here, it <em>does</em> in fact seem (though I could be wrong) that emptiness both has a limit, and is alone associated with what most refer to as “enlightenment” — once it’s absolutely clear that every-thing is unfathomable, has no existence as a thing in itself, etc... AND the mind is steady enough to “never forget it...” I don’t really see a “further,”
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In that direction, by your own framing of the situation, yes, there is "no further".
</p>

<p>
	But there is further in the upward direction. If you poo-poo the upward direction, then yes, you're done. Or stuck.
</p>

<p>
	And if you choose to define that as "full enlightenment" then you are fully enlightened by your own self-imposed definition.

		</p>

		<p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Both directions are important and valid.
</p>

<p>
	My only point is, don't invalidate the upward direction. Even though I like the upward direction more than the downward I don't invalidate the downward. The whole thing must come full-circle in the end. You could say some of us are traversing the circle upward and some of us downward, and we debate each other as we cross paths about which direction is better.
</p>

<p>
	Some spiritual schools, like Zen/Vedanta, have a bias towards traversing the circle downward. While some spiritual schools, like Christianity, Hinduism, or psychonauts, have a bias towards traversing the circle upward. The upward schools tend to talk about Love and God more, and they tend to be more mystical and otherworldly. But of course this is a gross over-simplification. You can traverse both ways and gain the benefits of both. Assuming you're openminded. And most spiritual people aren't.

<title>The More Consious I become the more sensitive I become about others suffering</title>

<p>
	For me, caring about the suffering of others is sorta getting old. Most people don't even care about their own suffering enough to do anything about it.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox of suffering is: if you care too much about it, you thereby exacerbate it.
</p>

<p>
	Caring about the suffering of others is important.
</p>

<p>
	But also, not caring about the suffering of others is important.
</p>

<p>
	That's not a typo.
</p>

<p>
	If you are the type of person who cares too much, you need to start not-caring more. And vice-versa.
</p>

<p>
	And while you're at it, stop caring about your own suffering.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/21379-the0self/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="21379" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/21379-the0self/" rel="">@The0Self</a> The way I conceive of it, awakening has one axis with two directions: the emptiness direction and the God-consciousness direction. You can move up or down. Down is emptiness, up is Infinite God Consciousness. But even the emptiness direction has degrees of realizing emptiness. And the God consciousness direction basically goes to infinite levels higher.
</p>

<p>
	And of course these two direction are not really two, they are one. God Consciousness IS emptiness, but it's also so much more than that.
</p>

<p>
	To me the realization of emptiness is peanuts compared to Infinite God Consciousness. Infinite God Consciousness is what you really want. Emptiness is cool but sorta meh. To stop at emptiness and proclaim it king is a big mistake in my book.
</p>

<p>
	I've experienced emptiness and Infinity many times. And Infinity is way superior. And although Infinity is emptiness, your classic gurus are not infinitely consciousness. Not even close. Like not even 1%. Emptiness is way easier than Infinity. So to stop at emptiness is to set the bar low whereas Infinity sets the bar infinitely high.
</p>

<p>
	Of course emptiness cannot really have levels to it. It's just infinitely empty. But just because you are empty does not mean you are infinitely conscious of yourself as God. You probably don't even realize what God is. You can have some degree of awakening but still fundamentally not realize what God is. To realize God in its fullness requires going up the axis, not down. This is why Buddhists and Neo-Advaitans can sit there and deny God with a straight face. They've gone all the way down, but not all the way up. And they have no clue what they're missing because they think they've made it.
</p>

<p>
	This shit is very tricky. Much trickier than any guru admits.
</p>

<p>
	In my book it is not enough to hollow out the ego-mind and just reside in emptiness. You must actually enter a state of Infinite God Consciousness. This is a state of Total Omniscience. This is God proper. How to achieve this state stably is the fundamental problem. Yes, it is a state. And you are definitely missing this state. You are not even 0.0001% to this state even if you think you are enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Totally emptying your mind is not the same thing as making your mind Infinite. Classic enlightenment teachers have a bias towards the former while poo-pooing the latter. But the latter is superior in my experience.
</p>

<p>
	God is not only no-mind. God is Infinite Mind.
</p>

<p>
	And if you're missing LOVE, it's because you've emptied your mind too much and got stuck there in nihilism. Try going up instead of down.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	P.S. Infinite Consciousness is way more than mere insights. At it highest levels Infinite Consciousness is the complete interconnection of every bit of consciousness in existence into a single infinitely interconnected and all-knowing point of singularity. You are not merely having insights about infinity at that point. YOU ARE INFINITY.

<p>
	There are levels of comprehension of Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	If you've only had one level of awakening, you have no idea how much you're missing.
</p>

<p>
	You are missing as much after your first awakening as you were before your first awakening.

<p>
	Denying states is so stupid because you can drink a bottle of vodka and obviously change your state.
</p>

<p>
	All states are Absolute Truth, but that doesn't mean there are no states or that states are not important.
</p>

<p>
	You are ALWAYS in some state. You cannot ever escape states. What you can do is not care about which state you are in, but this too is rather stupid because your state matters.
</p>

<p>
	People who say state doesn't matter are saying so from a highly functional state which they totally take for granted.
</p>

<p>
	Whether you chase states or not, your state is still absolutely crucial for life.
</p>

<p>
	Again, all states are Absolute Truth, but few states are highly functional or deeply self-aware.
</p>

<p>
	The state of psychosis is Absolute Truth, but you don't want to be in that state.
</p>

<p>
	If Anna Brown was in a psychotic state, she would not be awake. To say that it doesn't matter is so absurd that it boggles the mind. If that doesn't matter then nothing matters to you -- in which case there is nothing further to discuss.

<p>
	The best way to stay safe is to measure your doses carefully and keep them low to moderate. Do not do high doses.
</p>

<p>
	Risk increases exponentially with dose. 2x the dose, 4x the risk. 4x the dose, 16x the risk.

<p>
	I like being a higher achiever. And I often worked more than 40 hrs per week. But it has to be carefully balanced out against the higher things in life. It shouldn't become a lifestyle nor its own end. You can do it for short bursts when something important needs to be completed.

	Yes, that's how it looks, and all the DMT vapor crystallizes on all that glass and you lose 50% of your dose on the glass. Then you gotta chase it down the pipe with the torch like an idiot and it ends up burning too.

<p>
	Nothing in life is absolutely safe.

	You could choke on a fish bone tomorrow.

<p>
	Psychedelics carry inherent dangers and risks that you cannot eliminate.

<p>
	Absurd logic which assumes that such things scale linearly. They don't. Many studies have been done and show that productivity does not continue to scale after 40+ hours/wk. In fact, you start making costly mistakes and then burn out.
</p>

<p>
	This is a good example of how dumb and illogical stage Orange logic can be.
</p>

<p>
	Not to even mention that high achievement is a pointless goal because it does not produce happiness, consciousness, truth, or love -- which are the real goal.
</p>

<p>
	Landing a man on Mars will not make Elon Musk any happier. Nor will it make mankind any happier. It's a rather shallow flex goal. It's just a sci-fi version of the rat-race designed to appeal to nerds who are so spiritually bankrupt they know nothing better.

Purely. No crazy, wacky, psychedelic-y visuals.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	God is everything, so crazy, wacky, psychedelic-y visuals are not excluded and in no way interfere or contradict becoming God. God is that.
</p>

<p>
	God is there with visuals or without. God is never not present. Every visual is it, but it is not limited to any visual.
</p>

<p>
	Don't poo-poo the visuals. The visuals can be a very profound and effective mode of communication and comprehension. Although never strictly necessary. It's icing on the nondual cake.
</p>

<p>
	Do not make the mistake of thinking that nonduality or awakening requires no visuals.
</p>

<p>
	A TV is a TV regardless of what it displays, or even whether it displays anything at all. But you are making the simple mistake of thinking that you cannot be conscious of the TV while it is displaying a movie. Of course you can. In fact, that's the point: to be conscious that the movie is the TV while it is playing. Otherwise you're lost in the illusion.
</p>

<p>
	So rather than rejecting visuals, embrace them and see right through them without getting hypnotized by them.
</p>

<title>Solipsism</title>

<p>
	This work is not about speculation or guesswork, it's about becoming exactly conscious of what is true.
</p>

<p>
	What are you? What is reality? What is another? What is consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	These are not questions to speculate about. Become directly conscious of what these things are until no more doubt or questions remain.
</p>

<p>
	If you are speculating about solipsism then you are clearly not conscious of what "other" is. Nor are you conscious of what "self" is.
</p>

<p>
	Stop presuming stuff and become conscious of Infinity.
</p>

	Never had a problem burning DMT in an oil pipe. It does not burn if done gently. Why would freebase burn?

<p>
	Hard to say because I take many small tokes. I never blast a full dose.
</p>

<p>
	I put in maybe 15-20mg and vape it like 5-10 times until the pipe becomes empty. By that point I am so conscious it feels like insanity.

	The biggest problem with DMT is how short it lasts.

		</p>

		<p>
			You know that all language, thinking and statements are only partly true, and cannot directly "be" absolutes. When you say things like in this thread, what is the motive behind it? By which standards do you choose what way you express your own experience? Are you trying to form your statements to be as "useful" as possible, even when you know they cannot capture actual "truth"?
		</p>

<p>
	You have to factor in the relativity of language into anything being said.

	Ego is actually a state of consciousness. Consciousness imagines itself to be a "someone". A human. A living creature. A thing that is conscious . A thing that has experiences. We might call this the egoic or materialistic state of consciousness. Changing that state of consciousness is necessary for the illusion of ego to dissolve.
</p>

<p>
	It is as if you were a child playing a game of cowboys and Indians, and you are imagining yourself as a cowboy. Is the cowboy real? It's a role that's being played, a mask being worn. You feel like a cowboy because you keep imagining that you are one. Until you stop imagining it. Ego is not a thing, it's an imaginary role you've adopted.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you might imagine yourself to be a woman. But right now you're imagining yourself to be a man. Except you tell yourself that you actually ARE a man, whereas being a woman would be imaginary to you. But both are imaginary. What is a man? A man is not a physical object. A man is a role you've adopted.

			I am here to tell you that that happened to me. And you were a critical part of that process. And when infinite Love imbued my body in Joy in those periods of higher consciousness, I do say "HOLY F**K!" And as such, seeing that part of the video had me cry as well because your reward was me feeling that...and I did feel it...thanks to you... <3 (teared up just as I typed this lol).

<p>
	The idea that things have consciousness is ego.
</p>

<p>
	That's how ego stays alive.
</p>

<p>
	Be ware of this most sneaky self-deception.
