<p>
	"Nothing matters" is an incomplete teaching. If nothing matters, everything matters.

You see, given a choice.... who would you trust..... me...or God? All these discussions ultimately come downÂ a Â simpleÂ question in my opinion... whether we believe in God or not. If the spirit is regenerated there is the understanding that we become part of God....yes. This must not be confused with the thought that we are God however.

<p>
	No, you're not getting it. Sorry.
</p>

<p>
	You are stuck in denial. Because you lack the necessary direct experience that you are God.

			From my understanding, although this stuff is difficult to get your head around....we are not God. We have a body...we have a soul (the YOU)... and we can have a regenerated spirit (The i am).

<p>
	But many health issues have to do with lack of consciousness, lying, self-hatred, fear, emotional blockages, false worldviews, overthinking, stress, emotional abuse, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Anything which can help elevate consciousness can help with healing too.
</p>

<p>
	Many people have healed themselves with psychedelics. To ignore or deny the healing properties of psychedelics is to rob many people of a life-saving tool.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening and healing go hand in hand because most health issues result from corrupt consciousness.

<p>
	The debates were pretty good this election cycle. There were so many of them that lots of issues got covered and things were pretty clearly laid out. There's no confusing who stands for what unless you didn't watch them.
</p>

<p>
	A debate with 10 people cannot ever be deep. The format has its limits and must work within that. No one is going to watch a 5 hour debate about technical policy details.
</p>

<p>
	Stop expecting some sort of perfection from democracy. It's a system. It is what it is. It's working okay. Constantly bashing it isn't a solution.

<title>Can Trump winning again would help the progressive movement more than having Biden?Â </title>

<p>
	Nah, too much 3 dimensional chess. A Trump win should be avoided as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Biden is not as bad as progressives make him out to be. He would still move the country forward.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, much of the stuff Bernie wants to pass would never pass the Congress anyway.
</p>

<p>
	Will Biden dismantle the whole capitalism neoliberal system? Hell no, but that's not gonna happen even under Bernie. That system is way too entrenched and people are not ready to give it up.
</p>

<p>
	We gotta take small wins.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump gets a 2nd term he will appoint 2 far right Supreme Court justices which will be a horrible blow for generations to come. That alone makes Biden worthwhile. Trump can do things in the 2nd term which will take generations to undo. So it's a poor move to try to help progressives by not voting for Biden. You will live to regret that. If Biden beats Bernie, accept it and vote for Biden vs Trump with the same enthusiasm you would have had for Bernie vs Trump. Never take for granted how much worse things could be than Biden.

			If I had to posit a guess, it would be because cubism, expressionism etc. was a reaction of the stuffy formalism of the stage Blue society it came form, and was used to express things like individualism, self-identity, one's own passion, the absurdity of excessive formalism such that was found in classical art, and so on. It's not really Green because it's not expressing feelings of love, humanity, ecology, etc and its not Turquoise because it wasn't really about mystical insights and oneness, although it may have had some Green elements to it.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a good explanation.
</p>

<p>
	If you studied art history you know most of Western art since Christ was about religious propaganda and displays of civilizational power. Portraits of kings, etc. That was stage Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Then came Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Picasso, Abstract Expressionism, Andy Warhol, etc. which threw that stage Blue paradigm in the trash in favor of individualistic artistic expression, materialism, breaking conventions, etc. Stage Green didn't really exist back then.

Better just drop it and smoke some 5meo. Problem solved. Too fat? You donâ€™t need to workout. Just use 5meo. It will heal all illnesses once you realise your god by miraculously zapping away your body fat. Give me a break.

<p>
	You canÂ start with any of those basic practices.
</p>

<p>
	I said 5-MeO-DMT if you really want to awaken now. But you have a long way to go before that.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't reduce my teachings down to such simple-minded black vs white drivel. I gave you lots of nuance which you don't want to hear.

<p>
	That's why you're the student and not the teacher.
</p>

<p>
	This work is very nuanced and tricky. It's best to stay humble until you get your legs before you go criticizing. Criticizism doesn't bother me. The problem is your criticism comes from a deep lack of experience and expertise, so it's largely a waste of time. Nothing personal. But you are just using all this criticism to avoid doing the actual work within yourself.

<p>
	Absolutely not.
</p>

<p>
	Only you baby. There's nothing in the universe but you.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't confuse God from some image or idea. Images and ideas will always come short of God itself.
</p>

<p>
	If you ever encounter something you think is other than God, expand your notion of God until it includes that thing. Ad infinitium. That is the true God.

I feel like you could ease the pedalÂ and stop compressing your development. You could develop other aspects of yourself like your physical body with ashtanga yoga since ultimately everything is being transmitted through your body. Make the antenna more durable.Â Slow down the pace of the psychedelic use and integrate over a period of 10Â years rather than 2. Ultimately you are still in a limited human form, perhaps you should embrace it.

<p>
	Worry about your own development and let me work on mine.

<title>Does Spiral Dynamics debunk historical materialism?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The material IS the spiritual, just in unrecognized form.
</p>

<p>
	SD and historical materialism both point at the same thing: most people need to meet their basic needs before they can evolve higher. Material needs like food, clean water, shelter, schools, police, healthcare, decent neighborhoods, decent courts, roads, and other infrastructure is crucial for further evolution.
</p>

<p>
	The sooner you satisfy the material, the sooner you can transcend it to the spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	It makes no sense to ask someone to meditate when he is being chased by the mafia or his children have no school to go to.
</p>

<p>
	Historical materialism is correct, but it fails to properly account for the highest levels of evolution which occur once the material needs are all met. Historical materialism reaches stage Green and cannot see above that to Tier 2. That's why SD is more powerful. It accounts for higher levels.
</p>

<p>
	You are everything that has every occurred or could ever occur. You are your creation.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not reached by dabblers. You underestimate how serious this work is.

<p>
	Serious spirituality is not without risks. You have to want it more than you want to live. Which explains why it is rare.

</p>

<p>
	Keep going deeper. You've only just begun. Don't increase your dose. Just do more trips and contemplate the shit out of each one until clarity is reached. Each trip will thus take you deeper and deeper. Until one day you reach total realization of yourself as God: creator of the Universe.

<p>
	Many of my trips are so good that's what maked them so challenging.
</p>

<p>
	You'll understamd once you have a breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all fear is an illusion. Once you realize that, that makes tripping easier.
</p>

<p>
	The fear isÂ just those aspects of the ego-self which require purification, until one day you transcend all fear and enter Paradise.
</p>

<p>
	Total awakening is the complete absence of fear because you are so conscious that you see all things as yourself, and God cannot fear itself. It makes no sense to fear Love.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is what keeps you locked in ego, seperated from God's Love.

<p>
	When you realize you are God, you also realize everyone is God, but you also realize thatÂ they have no clue that they are GodÂ and your heart breaks at the thought of how to communicate it to them such that they could realize it.
</p>

<p>
	The tragedy of God is that it's so good it is denied by almost all precisely because it sounds too good to be true. Yet it is nothing but Absolute Truth. How could Absolute Truth be denied? The mind finds a million ways.

			Gotta disagree here. Poll after poll has shown, that when people are asked about which issues they support, they overwhelmingly come out in favor of the so-called Â´progressiveÂ´ agenda: Universal health care, gun control, no endless wars,Â legalizingÂ marijuana, etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But that's not how people vote. People do not vote on policy, they vote using their gut which follows their level of development. People vote based on the candidates personality and vibe more than policy.
</p>

<p>
	On paper, yes, people like many progressive policies, but they are also scared of change and they vote like sheep in a herd. They do not carefully evaluate things and they are not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to make Green happen.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to say you want Med4All in a poll. It's a lot harder when you realize your taxes might go up, and you might have to sacrifice your current doctor to make it happen, and you might have to vote against your own family, friends, and church group.
</p>

<p>
	It's like if you polled people in Iraq whether they want to live in a rich democractic country. They would all say yes. But when you tell them they have to surrender fundamentalist Islam and clan warfare and petty corruption, they will not be able to do it because they haven't developed that high yet. Good stuff comes at a cost. It isn't free. If you want to live in a democracy there areÂ certain sacrifices that must be made, like tolerating your neighbhor who has a different religionÂ than you. Or not killing gays for being gay. You'd think such sacrifices are not a big deal, but they are a big deal to many traditional people. People are scared of change. People are scared of selflessness. Most people treats politics and life as an arms race, looking to gain the most advantage for themselves rather than doing what is best for the collective. People's fear , hate, and selfishness overpowers their love, hope, and selflessness. It's easy to say you want love, but will you actually follow through when your survival is threatened? Will you lay down your fear and judgment? Most won't. People want love but aren't willing to pay the cost to get it.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck convincing a mother of 3 who works in accounting for the health insurance industry to support Med4All when it means that she will likely lose herÂ job andÂ her kids will notÂ get the toys they want for Xmas.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just evil corporations at work here. The "evil corporations" are supported by many middle class folks because it pays their bills. "The establishment" is made out of ordinary citizens, not some special race of evil reptile people.
</p>

<p>
	How do you convince ordinary citizens to sacrifice for the greater good? << That is the root problem here.
</p>

<p>
	And also, how do you get them to stop thinking and acting like herd animals? In a herd, even if one sheep develops a mind of its own, very soon it will be peer pressured by theÂ herd toÂ fall back in line. The herd feels comfy with Biden. Policies be damned.

<p>
	It's not rigged against Bernie,Â theÂ majority of the country is simply not educated or developed enough to vote for Green.
</p>

<p>
	In a democracy, not the best candidates wins, but the one who best matches the development level of the people. That what we're seeing. That's also why Trump won.
</p>

<p>
	The simple fact is, Americans are pretty damnÂ ignorant, so you shouldn't expect them to all of the sudden elect amazing people. That has never been the case.
</p>

<p>
	What Bernie supporters and progrrssives need to understand is that they are in a bubble. The majority of the Americans are not progressive, they are moderate. "The establishment" is not just the corporations, media, and Washington, it is most of the citizens as well. The media is establishment precisely because that's what most people pay to watch, not because the media is somehow overriding the will of the people. The will of the people is just not very bright and the media reflects that. The establishment IS the people. That's what progessives are in denial about.
</p>

<p>
	I see a lot of progressives in denial about thier own biases, projecting their progressive bias on the media and estblaishment. When a progressive calls theÂ media biased, the truth is, the progressive is biased but cannot see it, so the only option is to blame the media.
</p>

<p>
	Joe Biden didn't win because of a rigged media. He won becauseÂ that's where most people are at. And that's a very difficult thing for progressives to admit. Progressives need to admit that most people are not progrssives. This is a more realistic starting point rather than assuming that a majority of people are progressives but some evil "establishment" is holding them back. That gets into fantastical conspiracy theory territory which fails toÂ properly identify the problem and take responsibility for it.

<title>Biden has come back</title>

<p>
	I don't really see Bernie winning it now.Â Most of the country is still not developed enough to see Bernie's appeal, hence Biden is what a majority can agree on.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that most of the US is not a solid stageÂ Green. So it's really hard for solid Green to get elected.
</p>

<p>
	Before someone like Bernie can win, voters have to grow up (or die). Most would rather die than grow up. So here we are.

<p>
	You are not going to be able to extract 5-MeO-DMT from grass. N,N-DMT maybe, if you're a good chemist with equipment.
</p>

<p>
	Not worth it. Much easier to get synthetic.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You can use a volcano like device or even create your own vape pen carts. Just avoid toxic oils that will ruin your lungs. Use pure turpenes inside of oil.
</p>

<p>
	Both methods work excellently and can be used with basically any powedered psychedelics, including 5-MeO-DMT. You can made a 5-MeO-DMT vape pen. But watch out, even one puff is very intense. Plugging is still superior for 5-MeO-DMT. If N,N-DMT plugged, I would plug it.

<p>
	Solipsism is not awakening. The mistake is thinking that what I'm talking about is solipism when I never made such a claim.
</p>

<p>
	The mind desperately wants some way to understand awakening so it grabs at every philosophical system is can: solipsism, nihilism, panpsychism, Buddhism,Â etc. And all of that is not awakening.

	The notion that you have a brain is itself the maze of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	To escape the maze is to realize it never existed other than in your imagination.

	When you think, "This is caused by the brain", that's you trapping yourself in the maze. The maze of materialism.

<p>
	That's exactly what's happening. But evolution takes time. We are smack dab in the middle of it.
</p>

<p>
	People take evolution for granted, thinking it's something that happened a million years ago. No. It's happening right now, via you.

			firstly, only something â€˜other than godâ€™ would need to proclaim itself as being god. Why would god need to say â€˜Iâ€™m godâ€™,.. I mean... should I write it in my resume now that Iâ€™m enlightened? Do I get a free parking spot at selected restaurants that says â€˜reserved for godâ€™?
		</p>

		<p>
			Secondly, If youâ€™re proclaiming that you are god, you can only say that to god. I mean thinkÂ about it, why would you need to say â€˜I am godâ€™ and by the way, I wonâ€™t even say that youâ€™re speaking to yourself, because thatâ€™s another trap the ego likes to hide in, but it just simply implies that you consider the person youâ€™re proclaiming it to something other than god. Such energy can only perpetuate arrogance and entitlement, which are sticking points of ego, not enlightenment.
		</p>

		<p>
			tldr: saying â€˜I am godâ€™ is the most unenlightened thing you can ever say

<p>
	You are speaking nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	You haven't realized what it means to be God. You are playing games.
</p>

<p>
	When you finally realize you are God, you will shout it from the top of your lungs. And all of your logic will fly out the window.
</p>

<p>
	You need to say "I am God" precisely because you're not conscious that you are. False humility is not a virtue here.

	Vaped some moderate doses of N,N-DMT. To me it feels very similar to a low dose of 5-MeO-DMT. Very similar headspace, but 5-MeO-DMT is a lot more potent. 5x to 10x more potent.

	Yup, it's brutal. Which is why alcohol exists.
</p>

<p>
	Without alcohol, the Earth's population would be 75% less.
</p>

<p>
	When doing approaches it's crucial to build up momentum. The first 5 approaches of the night are just a warm up. After the first 5, everything becomes much easier. After 15 approaches in one night, each next approach becomes effortless. Then the next night you gotta start all over again from zero.

<p>
	Depends on many factors.
</p>

<p>
	The very notion of enlightenment as temporary or permement is dualistic and untennable since time is imaginary. From God's POV it makes noÂ difference if you awaken for 1 minute or 100 years. As a human you may not like only being awake for 1 minute, but that's not God's problem.
</p>

<p>
	You are only as conscious as your current state of consciousness. It couldÂ change any second.
</p>

<p>
	There are states of awakening soÂ high that you could not function as a human from such a state. You could not walk or eat because you'd be too conscious. Life is impossible in such states. So in practice awakening gets tuned down to functional levels or the person would soon die. The highest states are temporary for such practical reasons.
</p>

<p>
	It is not practical to have your car's gas pedal permanently pressed down at max.

Can we create one in which I reverse time and become 10 years old?Â Are the possibilities truly endless or can our stream of conciousness only be altered in specific ways? Are there limits to what a psychedelic can do?

<p>
	Consciousness is unlimited.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to create any new psychedelics. The ones which exist are more than enough to blow your mind.

IÂ can get lost in conceptualisation because the mind doesnâ€™t want to turn inwards. Abandoning all concepts and ideas is necessary then to become concious of what conciousness is. This is what marks theÂ transition from stage yellow to turquoise. As I long as I continue to distract myself on this forum by trying to understand awakening and conciousness the farther I get away from The Truth. The next step for me is to do the practices and stop distracting myself on this forum.Â

<p>
	Don't fret too much. All this intellectualization is part of your path.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, eventually you will transcend it all.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not Â straight path from A to B. It's a twisted path from A to Z with a bunch of stuff in between.
</p>

<p>
	You are struggling to realize you ate God. It doesn't make sense to your human mind how it is possible that you could be God. But keep at it and one day you will awaken. Psychedelics help enormously.

One the number 0-9 are the truly indifferent Â numbersÂ once you get to 10 your just combining these numbers its doesnâ€™t seem like its diversely infinite its like using the power of unlimited space to basically repeat forever i mean yeah in a sense if you count up they all be different in a way but they also be very simularÂ 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, each number is unique.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to use 0-9, you could invent a new symbol for each number.
</p>

<p>
	We use 0-9 because it's easier than havingÂ to invent and memorize a million symbols.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing special about 0-9. It's just a social convention.
</p>

<p>
	11 is as unique as 1 or 2.

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics isn't really a measure of consciousness, it's a measure of mental development. Ultimately this is a minor and existentially insigificant thing. Awakening does not map to Spiral Dynamics at all. SD is just a handy model for understanding average humans.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the sense of awakening in a totally different league.
</p>

<p>
	Look around you. Can you point to anything which isn't consciousness? Try.

			I understand that. But please describe "fully conscious." It's a misnomer. The Dial is infinite, and your consciousness of God deepens and broadens all the time. At what point do you say, "now you're fully conscious."? I'm baffled that something you recently described as a complex set of dials has now been reduced to a binary on/off. From my experience and others, it's clear that the dial analogy is much more accurate.Â 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It is an infinite dial, but there are points on the dial where God awakens to itself as God.
</p>

<p>
	God realization is a distinct event. Either it is, or is not occuring. This point delineates awakeness vs asleepness. But even so, there are many degrees to God's self-awareness. Hence many levels of awakeness.
</p>

<p>
	Almost no one has reached the highest levels. Not even your favorite enlightened teachers. I consider most of them asleep.

<p>
	No because creation is endless. God itself cannot ever reach its own end because it has no beginning or end.
</p>

<p>
	You can count up the natural numbers forever without ever repeating one. Give it a try.

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	There is only your mind.
</p>

<p>
	But your mind is identical to the whole world and other people.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine the entire universe because you are God pretending to be human. You are one. There cannot be anything outside of you.
</p>

<p>
	All outsides are inside your mind.

<p>
	Kambo will make you vomit your guts out.
</p>

<p>
	But that can be healing.
</p>

<p>
	You can use the search function to find some old threads about peoples' experiences with it.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't expect it to heal serious things like Alzheimers. But it might heal you at the mental/spiritual level, helping you shed some ego.
</p>

<p>
	Kambo is not a psychedelic at all. It is a poison. It's basically like deliberately getting bit by aÂ snake just for the experience.
</p>

<p>
	When you are being aware that you are human, you are actually misunderstanding what you are. You are imagining that you are human, in the same way that you could imagine that you are a kangaroo. But that doesn't make you a kangaroo. Only in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you are God. But you are too busy imagining you are human to notice this. The human obscures the God like clouds the sun.

<p>
	As you do more of this work you will become more compassionate with regards to the needless suffering of others.
</p>

<p>
	You need a heart awakening to really start to care about people. Most peoples' hearts are so closed and all they care about is themselves. But you cannot create a well-functioning and healthy community that way.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a family in which no one cared about the others. It would be a toxic disaster.

</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean you can't be passionate about your LP.
</p>

<p>
	But also, if you're first starting to become conscious of the existential Emptiness of life, that will likely rob you of motivation and make you depressed for a short period of time until you integrate it and the ego gets over it.
</p>

<p>
	A sense of meaninglessness and loss is a common egoic reaction to deep consciousness work. It will pass once you go deeper. It is one of the many threshold guardians which guard the deepest Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Trust that your sense of passion will come back even stronger once you fully awaken. But also be open to your passions changing and evolving. Maybe your passion for your current work will die completely but that's because some new greater passion with take its place. Be open to that.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, the ego will go through a period of mourning its own death. Just like it does with the death of a loved one. There is a period of resistance, emotional upheaval, depression, then acceptance, letting go, and moving on.
</p>

<p>
	Of course authoritarianism exists precisely because it works.
</p>

<p>
	But it only works up to a certain point.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness it stops working and becomes counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	So yes, at certain (low) levels of consciousness you have to be a dick to be successful.
</p>

<p>
	But at the highest levels of consciousness being a dick will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Not understanding that there are different levels of consciousness and that your followers have different levels of consciousness and different systems of values will make this guy's analysis and interviews incomplete.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different leadership styles which correspond to consciousness and values levels. Not to mention that you someone cannot escape being a dick if they are stuck in a certain level of consciousness. The leader himself has to grow massively to stop being authoritarian and yet remain effective. This is not easy to do for most people. Which is why its so rare and authoritarianism and abuse of power is so common.
