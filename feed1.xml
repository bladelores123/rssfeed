Cooking food is baked into our DNA. It's not something we just do nowadays. We've been doing it since before we were even homo sapiens. Likewise for things like wearing furs. Your body is bald precisely because it adapted to wearing clothing.

<title>Question regarding living in a “non-neurotic state of being or consciousness</title>

If you are not addicted to sex, how do you know when to have sex?
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the solution to these issues. The more conscious you become the more wholesome your actions become overall, the more you act in alignment with wisdom and intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Balance is a function of wisdom and consciousness.

	Focus on developing your strengths.

<p>
	If you are a visionary big picture thinker, that is far more valuable than bean-counting. Stop trying to get the bean-counters' approval.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This just doesn't square with the facts.
</p>

<p>
	Humans have successfully adapted to cold environs for 100,000s of years. In fact, cold climates are more ideal for the growth of civilization, which is why the most developed countries are from the north, generally speaking.
</p>

<p>
	Eskimos are well adpated to living in Alaska and Nepalese have specially adapted lungs for living in the high altitudes. They can climb Mt Everest without oxygen tanks when most white people need to use oxygen tanks.
</p>

<p>
	And of course our skin colors have fully adapted to the climate we hail from.
</p>

<p>
	Evolution adapts fast. It's always adapting, even today.
</p>

<p>
	Humans and technology go hand in hand. These two cannot be treated seperately. Technology is a huge part of our evolution. We have adapted to cooked meat, fire, clothing, etc. long ago.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, we lived through the ice age and ate all the mammoths (probably). If you hail from Europe, eating mammoths is in your DNA.

	Humans are more diverse than a single other species because we adapted to live all over the world.
</p>

<p>
	Humans who survived in Alaska didn't do it on fruit.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's exactly the solution.
</p>

<p>
	Go be around people of various races and cultures until you stop seeing them as other or weird.
</p>

<p>
	Racism is very simple: it happens because people get stuck in a small circle of those who look like them and think like them. If everyone traveled around the world and interacted with people of all races and cultures, racism would disappear in a few generations.
</p>

<p>
	People deliberately segment themselves into like-minded enclaves in order to avoid expanding their sense of self and realizing their oneness with all beings.
</p>

<p>
	This is why people in major cities are less racist than those who live in the countryside. Because in a big city you are forced to interact with those who are different than you, but in the countryside you're living among your own kind, living in a racial/ethnic bubble.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, stopping wanting to cling to your own kind enough though that is what's more comfortable for your ego-mind.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	My point is not about politics. It's about the attachments you're exhibiting. You are missing the point of what I said to you, because you're stuck on matters of content.
</p>

<p>
	I let people know about pundits' fallacies in a non-attached way, conscious of the relativity of my perspective. That is the crucial difference. You are on here pushing an agenda every week. It's a question of attachment vs detachment for your own perspective.

Let it go. The way you comment is not in the spirit of our work here. Free your mind of that shit.
</p>

<p>
	All this political stuff you must hold very loosely, otherwise it turns into just another ideology. The content of your ideology is irrelevant, what matters is that your mind is stuck on it.
</p>

<p>
	Our work here is not to find better content to cling to, but to go meta and become conscious of the relativity of all content held. When you become conscious of this, you stop judging and blaming people.

<p>
	There is no how.
</p>

<p>
	Your looking for a how is the dualistic mistake.

<p>
	You are engaged in the process of asking what the Earth stands upon? Elephants. And what do the elephants stand upon? A turtle. And so on...
</p>

<p>
	This entire pursuit of elephants and turtles is misguided. There is just the Earth! No elephants or turtles. No how. 100% direct. Nothing is hidden. You need to realize that and stop chasing your tail.

<p>
	Lol, that is his fundamental mistake.
</p>

<p>
	He's running away from himself with his philosophical work. And it's obvious just by looking at his neurotic ticks when he speaks.
</p>

<p>
	This is the problem with academic philosophy. All brains, no consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is that there is no difference between inside and outside. But if Zizek would turn within, he'd discover God. Which is a problem for him, since he's an avowed atheist/materialist. So he keeps looking outside, forever lost in his own mind.

No explanation will work because all explanations are dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	So try all you want, but you will always fail. The only solution is to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why Zen masters do not answer your questions. Because all your questions are misguided attempts by the ego-mind to maintain its dualistic delusional reality.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to this problem exists on a new plane of consciousness from the one you're currently at. You will not be able to reason your way to that new plane.

<p>
	Oh God I love these libertarian videos:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VcqPFR1DxCc?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	Just goes to show how stuck the mind can get in stage Orange ideologies.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that a human can survive independent of society is a complete fiction. There has never been such a time in 300,000 years of human history. Less developed government means MORE dependence, not less. In tribal cultures humans are totally dependent on the tribe. No one is a lone libertarian wolf there.
</p>

<p>
	Even chimpanzees cannot survive on their own without a tribe.

	I'm a lone wolf type guy so I avoid these issues simply by keep to myself and following my life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	If someone is being an ass to you, leave their company. If it's a boss or coworker, then that's more challenging but that's basically turning into workplace harassment. You should be able to speak to HR about that and get them to stop. If it's a friend, change friends. If it's a family member, move away from your family or confront them about it. If it's happening at school, just ignore the person and stay away from them.

</p>

<p>
	There is a structural difference between the two. A stage Green person has no desire to be a fascist. They have outgrown that. They have a desire to support others who are different than them.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, sometimes a Green person might get upset or act foolish, but they will not create a fascist government.
</p>

<p>
	TYT is never going to lead to fascism, but Fox News could. Of course TYT can still be biased and lead to other lesser problems. CNN would also never lead to fascism because they are above that.

<p>
	Keep in mind that things have evolved a lot since Da Vinci's time.
</p>

<p>
	Today to succeed you must be more specialized. You can't be an architect, a painter, an engineer, and a writer because you will be out-competed by others who specialize in just one thing.
</p>

<p>
	Back in Da Vinci's time fields like engineering, architecture, etc. were not as developed or deep as they are today. It will take you 10 years of study just to become a decent engineer. And now you need work experience, licenses, certifications, etc.
</p>

<p>
	So you can certainly be a polymath in the casual sense of studying lots of topics, but you ain't gonna master them all enough to make a career out of. Pick your career field more carefully. Even something like Engineering is far too broad. You need to pick what kind of engineer you want to be.
</p>

<p>
	Competition is a lot more fierce today. So many amazing specialists to compete against. And it's a global marketplace. In Da Vinci's time the marketplace was a single city of 300,000 people, most of whom were peasants who couldn't read.

<p>
	I would prefer to go vegetarian for ethical reasons if it didn't disrupt my life too much.
</p>

<p>
	Of course taste of the food is a factor. Meat probably tastes better to me. But that could be retrained.
</p>

<p>
	But for example, I don't like eating fruit all the time. It becomes too sugary and gross. I don't know how people pull that off for long periods of time even if it gives them enough energy. My body doesn't tolerate a fruit only diet.

	It's not true acceptance if in the back of your mind you're accepting it only so that you can avoid facing it.
</p>

<p>
	"I accept that I have gay desires as long as that means I won't ever have any gay sex" << that's not acceptance!
</p>

<p>
	True acceptance would be: "It's okay if the only kind of sex I have in my life from now on is gay sex."
</p>

<p>
	Acceptance requires that you face the thing you don't want to face. Not hypothetically, but actually. That doesn't mean you actually have to have sex with a man, but you do have to face and accept the prospect of it until the point where it doesn't bother you.
</p>

			However it seems "impossible" with linear time thinking. In high levels of consciousness this type of time perception changes radically enough that you can see clearly what you said? Or is just an explanation/analogy what you are saying?

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yeah, what I'm saying is impossible to imagine from your current state of consciousness. You'd need a radical change of state.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, time and even cause & effect collapse in nonduality such that the impossible becomes possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can clearly recognize that you are the entire universe happening all at once. This is nondual awakening. No, it's not any analogy or explanation. You are the whole universe happening as we speak.
</p>

<p>
	Just as one example, I once became conscious that I wrote every book mankind has ever created. Not only did I write all the books in the universe, I am all of them too. The pages of every book is made out of my consciousness. And this goes for everything in the universe. I am everything that could ever possibly be. All of this is direct absolute truth. Not explanation or thinking or theory. It is not even perception. It is more true than perception and more true than mathematics.

			This mother/father stuff is the focus of psychology because child development is additive - new layers/functions are built on top of the old ones.<br />
			If child's needs aren't addressed by the parents, it will learn to satisfy them unconsciously by adopting coping mechanisms that will last a lifetime unless addressed. That is where the sex part comes in - these unconscious behaviors usually come bunched up with sex because it is an "adult" form of love.

<p>
	Sure, but it's all overblown.

<p>
	Your mother and father and sex are not that important.

<p>
	Unless your mother or father molested you, it's not a big deal.

<p>
	The ultimate truth is that male and female are both just aspects of your infinite self. You can have male and female orgasms. Both masculine and feminine energies are running through you and you will become most powerful once you integrate them both and experience life from both POVs.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine how powerful you would be if you were totally comfortable with your sexuality no matter what it was. That is true strength.
</p>

<p>
	To worry or fear about being gay is weakness.
</p>

<p>
	This is why Self-Love is the ultimate strength. It requires total fearlessness. So this is great opportunity for you to train yourself to be strong. A strong man is able to have sex with another man. A weak man is not. Your culture has this all backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Dude, look at the silliness of your position.
</p>

<p>
	If you desire to be fucked, that's YOUR DESIRE, YOUR WANT. The problem is that you are denying your own wants. The solution is to accept your own wants. It is your right to deny your own wants or embrace them.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I came to you and said I want to eat ice cream. But I don't want ice cream. I hate ice cream. Don't I have a right to hate ice cream? I'm so unlucky to want ice cream.
</p>

<p>
	You would call me insane.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is simply that your culture has brainwashed you to believe that men aren't supposed to enjoy getting fucked. But all that is, is cultural brainwashing. You must question your own cultural norms and assumptions until you realize that they are completely arbitrary, groundless, and even dysfunctional, as in this case. Your culture tells you that men shouldn't enjoy getting fucked, yet the truth is that many men in your culture enjoy it. So what is the point of following a culture which is so clearly untruthful? You'd have to be crazy to buy into such a culture. Then again, you were brainwashed into it from birth, so it feels like it shouldn't be questioned.

<p>
	You are all bodies, all beings, all things.
</p>

<p>
	If you woke up as a kangaroo tomorrow, you'd still be asking, "Why this kangaroo? Why not something else?" And so it would go until you went through every being and ended up right where you are right now. Someone has to be in your shoes. So here you are! Actually, no one is in your shoes. No one is in everyone's shoes, looking through everyone's eyes.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, since you are the only being in existence, you have to be in all places at once. So you are in this place right now. Every place is as important as any other.

</p>

<p>
	If your friends are stage Orange/Green or Green, it should be okay. But low Orange and below will be a problem. Blue will be a big problem.
</p>

<p>
	Homosexuals basically don't exist in Blue cultures. Because they are demonized and even killed if they come forward. Blue forces a repression of homosexuality. It's a total denial.

<p>
	I'm no expert on it, but the whole theme of interpreting human actions as a desire for sex, sexual organs, hidden perverted sexual desires, and all the mother/father stuff is just way too overblown.
</p>

<p>
	A being's actions are not primarily about sex, they are about self-survival. Sex is a tiny part of that. Psychoanalysis doesn't understand this and of course it doesn't understand spirituality, self-transcendence, nonduality, epistemology, or metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	Freud projected his own sexual perversions onto the world and saw in the world a reflection of his own neurotic shadow self. But just because Freud was that way doesn't mean we all are that way. In fact most of us are not.
</p>

<p>
	I don't find Freud's theories useful for personal development or self-transcendence. There are much better frameworks. Most self-help frameworks are better. Go grab any random book in the self-help isle of the bookstore and you will get better and more useful advice for improving your life than by reading Freud. Any book on my book list will be far better.
</p>

<title>Overcoming stage green ego</title>

<p>
	I agree we need to distinguish between progressives and neoliberals/centrists.
</p>

<p>
	But how it's done is also important. It's important to recognize that lots of people are neoliberals and centrist liberals because that is their level of development. You can't brow-beat them into becoming progressives. Almost by definition progressives are the rarest ones on the political spectrum.
</p>

<p>
	So while it's important to not confuse a neoliberal for a progressive, attacking neoliberals and centrist Dems is problematic because you just can't convert all Dems into progressives. There needs to be coalition and some mutual acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	My problem with Jimmy Dore is that I feel he's too aggressive. It's like red meat for progressives but it won't work to build a coalition. Being a rabid dog is not a good way to go. Bernie is very progressive but he's not so rabid and obnoxious about it, which allows him to attract people who normally wouldn't call themselves progressives or socialists or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	A very important principle for you to learn is that of meeting people where they're at. This will come up for you over and over again in life if you're going to be an advanced human. A lot of people will not be as advanced as you, and your solution to that cannot be to obnoxiously attack or "otherize" them.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that these are all your brothers and sisters. That is the real challenge. It would be so much easier if we could otherize half the population and lock them up in Montana. But we can't.
</p>

<p>
	Unconditional Love definitely has a feeling to it, too.
</p>

<p>
	You're simply missing a mystical experience of Love. Try contemplating what love is on a psychedelic. You're disconnected from Being, and thinking about love in the abstract is not going to be enough to reconnect you. You need a direct experience to jolt you awake.
</p>

<p>
	You might also want to optimize your brain health, mental health, nutrition, energy, etc. to make sure that some chemical imbalance or energetic block is not obstructing you. Get blood work done. Check for vitamin deficiencies, heavy metal toxicity, etc. Dial in your health because it is the foundation for everything else.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you have too much lead or mercury in your brain, you may not be able to feel love the way you otherwise could.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't feel anything, that shows me some deeper underlying chemical or health issue. Or possibly some energetic blockage. That is not normal. Start researching your symptoms.
</p>

<p>
	If you're practicing Sedona Method, you gotta let go 100s and 1000s of times.
</p>

<p>
	You don't just let go once and you're done. It's more like meditation, where you get go of one thought, but then it comes back and you keep letting it go 1000 times.
</p>

<title>Self-love video applied to quitting an addiction</title>

<p>
	That's not the issue.
</p>

<p>
	The point is: feel love for yourself either way.
</p>

<p>
	Don't THINK about love but actually FEEL love for yourself and your addictive situation. The way a loving mother might if you told her you're addicted to weed. That doesn't mean she wants you doing more weed. But she would lovingly empathize for the challenging situation you find yourself in. Do that, but to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Separate the love from your plans to fix the problem. Love first, fix later. As guys we tend to skip immediately to the fixing phase, skipping the love and acceptance phase.
</p>

<p>
	And if you slip and do more weed even though you intended to stop. Love yourself for that failure too.
</p>

<p>
	Red Pill is a toxic, garbage ideology. No more Red Pill on this forum. I expect you guys to be above such things.
</p>

<p>
	Watch my videos about the problems with ideology, survival, and self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	To free your mind you must avoid all self-biased ideologies.

<p>
	This is silly.
</p>

<p>
	There is still a big excess of masculine energy in government and positions of power. We are nowhere near a healthy balanced point.
</p>

<p>
	Again, this is a conflation of stage Green with stage Red. The worry that stage Green will become fascistic is totally overblown. The bigger worry is actual stage Red & Blue fascism -- which is still a real force around the world.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be wise enough to pick the right things to worry about. Worrying about excess Green is like worrying about the women's bathroom on the Titanic while it is sinking. Your worry is misdirected.

<p>
	1) It's an excellent teaching
</p>

<p>
	2) If you still have no clue how to let go, you haven't really been listening. The teaching is super, super simple.
</p>

<p>
	There is no method for letting go. You just let go. That is the method. Simple. But it requires practice. Stop looking for intellectual explanations. Just do it.

<p>
	You can cycle practices throughout the year, to keep things fresh and yet not overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
	The point of trying lots of practices is to find those small handful which you will commit to. And also to have ones in the back pocket for when your life takes a turn in the future and you are in need of some specific one. These practices will be useful throughout the rest of your time at different points.

<p>
	I think what everyone overlooks is the simple fact that people have different nutritional needs. There is no one best diet in the abstract. The question is always: What is the best diet <u>FOR ME</u>? And that you can only discover through trial and error.
</p>

<p>
	There are many factors at play: your genetics, geography, climate, your budget, your health conditions, your level of development, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I have found that vegetarian does not work well for me. It doesn't give me the energy that I need to function well. But it would be a mistake to apply my conclusion to all other people. My conclusion is for me.

<title>Is a world Government even possible?</title>

<p>
	Obviously systems would need to be put in place such that there is no chance of a tyrant controlling the world government. There needs to be robust system of checks and balances and a robust impeachment process for any high level leaders. There need to be independent ethics boards with power to investigate and also to remove corrupt leaders.
</p>

<p>
	Basically we need a World Constitutional Convention as we had in America back at its founding where all the countries agree on a set of rules and norms for how the world government will function, with a set of checks and balances to make sure it is protected against devirly and manipulation.
</p>

<p>
	All of this will happen, but probably not in our lifetimes. Citizens aren't developed enough yet to see the wisdom in such a system. People are too xenophobic, prideful, and nationalistic still. A world government can only work when a large amount of citizens have a global identity. People would have to stop seeing themselves as Chinese, Hindu, Jew, American, Japanese, German, Christian, Muslim, etc. and just see themselves humans.
</p>

<p>
	I was going to but hesitated because I have a feeling it's gonna be a nasty come-up.
</p>

<p>
	Why go through nastiness when there are so many other substances that go down smoothly?
</p>

<p>
	But if was going to do mescaline I would definitely go pure synthetic.
</p>

<p>
	The cactus is there as a last resort if you've got no other choice.

<p>
	Synthetic is going to dose a lot more accurately.

	Energetic and paranormal aspects of spirituality. Things like reiki, healing, psychics, siddhis, etc. I know they are real but I don't understand how they work.

<p>
	Serious mental health issues like schizophrenia, psychosis, and other such mental "disorders", treating suicidal people, treating clinically depressed people, etc. Which is why I avoid those issues in my work.

	Our current system is insanely inefficient. We lost $2-3 trillion in the Iraq war alone.

<p>
	Military spending is the single greatest waste of human resources. That is trillions of dollars going to fund devilry.

	Sadhguru has a lot of good teachings. Just don't look up to him on politics. Politics is not no his field of mastery.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that even the best teachers are only good within their domain of mastery. Not across the board on all topics.

If it works for you, then be happy with that. People will naturally be closedminded and skeptical about psychic methods.

<p>
	Your best shot at glimpsing enlightenment is to patiently work to solve your mental health issues, ween off meds, and then take a psychedelic. You will see what enlightenment is.

	If you think the progressive movement isn't woke enough for you, you're out of luck in this lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	By fighting with progressives you end up helping the conservative devils who don't give a damn about minorities for the most part.
</p>

<p>
	Don't overthink politics. When you have a choice between A, B, and C -- pick the most progressive one and be satisfied. The system can only evolve so fast.
</p>

<p>
	Today's candidates are the best and most progressive ever. We are lucky to have them. Don't forget how bad things have been in the recent past.

<p>
	Just accept it and move on with pursuing what your heart is calling you to do. Deal with the obstacles and problems as they arise. If your parents refuse to help you in following your heart, then follow it anyway without their help.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let following your heart be negotiable. You can't succeed at something your heart isn't into.
</p>

<p>
	This whole thing about psychics being frauds is way overblown.
</p>

<p>
	It's mostly an excuse made by materialists because they do not want to admit that psychic abilities are real.
</p>

<p>
	First you must admit that psychic abilities are real. Then we can acknowledge that a few people are frauds and avoid them.

<p>
	No, you can become conscious that you are not inside a simulation.
</p>

<p>
	Your reasoning is assuming dualities which you could transcend and be free off.

<p>
	Awakening comes with surrendering the ego-mind's insistence on control. It is the ego-mind which wants to manipulate reality. The ego-mind cannot be allowed to do whatever it wants as that would become hell.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if Bin Laden could materialize a nuclear bomb with his mind.
</p>

<p>
	Such power can only be allowed to the most selfless and loving. And infinite power can only be allowed to a completely selfless being -- the Godhead. Having form automatically limits your power. The cost of infinite power is total formlessness and total selflessness to the point where no one can even know you exist.

	Maybe. But there were other things they said which cross-validated.

<p>
	Overall I was impressed.
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty clear that they aren't speaking from some memorized script but that they are getting intuitive visions as they work with you. Stuff pops up for them in real-time. It's not like they sat down and studied a book which said: "Okay, if this guy walks in complaining about his thyroid, you tell him he was choked in a past life. And if he walks in with a back ache, you tell him he broke his back in a past life."
</p>

<p>
	You have to give these folks some credit. They are not idiots.

<p>
	See my video about Division vs Unity. That's the issue you're bringing up here.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is a constant tug of war between division and unification. Neither one is good or bad by itself. Societies unify, divide, unify, divide, unify, divide.... at higher and higher orders. There must be a delicate balance between the two or things get ugly. That's life. Embrace this oscillatory process because it is an existential feature of how reality generates itself.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, culture is important in order to create a sense of social unity. But it can also easily get out of hand and become toxic and too monocultural. Culture by itself is not inherently good or bad. There are healthy and unhealthy cultures. Distinguish between the two. Too much of a good thing becomes a bad thing.
</p>

<p>
	Also, your framing of our civilization as losing its purpose with the downfall of Christianity, that's a very limited view. Western civilization existed long before Christianity and will continue to exist long after. You are right though that we've had a flourishing of multiculturalism and a breakdown of the traditional Christian monoculture which used to unify the West. This was a necessary evolutionary step as we moved from Spiral stage Blue to Orange and beyond.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget how vicious, cruel, corrupt, and oppressive the Christian monoculture was. They burned witches at the stake. Today I can go find a witch on Yelp and hire her for her healing and psychic services. It's much better today.
</p>
