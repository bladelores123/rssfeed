<p>
	Yes but then how do you handle a situation where an atheist comes into the temple and starts teaching atheism and nihilism?
</p>

<p>
	It is tricky to handle that because you're damned if you kick him out and damned if you don't.
</p>

<p>
	And that's precisely the problem of how do you handle ignorance? It's not easy. You cannot escape fragmention in the relative world. You can be super enlightened but fragmentation will still happen to you. It will be thrust upon you. As God you are doomed to forever keep dividing yourself.
</p>

<p>
	People will attack you just for speaking the truth.

<p>
	After enough trips you realize that your whole life is one long trip, so the distinction disappears.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference really between being high and sober other than that you are much more conscious of your full capacities when high.
</p>

<p>
	God and Love are always present. It's just a question of how disconnected one is from it.

<p>
	Yes, it is very hard.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it does point to deeper systemic economic problems which need to be reformed.
</p>

<p>
	But, it can still be done. Success requires a lot of trial and error and persistence. Remember, you only need one thing to pan out. All those courses have laid some foundation. Now you're ready to pounce on some new opportunity.
</p>

<p>
	Success in business requires being opportunistic and creative. You can't just copy what everyone else is doing. You must always be on the lookout for your niche. Always be thinking about how you can provide massive value to the world.

			Have you considered that all this talk about love and fireworks is result of taking psychodelics and don't have much to do with enlightement which is simply what is ? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Love is simply what is.
</p>

<p>
	If you are a serious student of spiritual texts and teachings, you know that the best of them talk about love. It has nothing to do with fireworks or psychedelics. Psychedelics simply show you your deepest nature -- if you have the courage to look at yourself in your rawest form.
</p>

<p>
	The reason some of guys have a hard time buying this whole love business it because you're still thinking of reality from the materialist paradigm. This paradigm can extremely subtle, such that even people who have an awakening or two -- such as Sam Harris -- still have not transcended it. According to materialism, the universe must be neutral, impersonal, and devoid of any sentimentality. This is a hyper-logical, hyper-masculine, reductionistic way of understanding reality. And it is untrue.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is Love. It is not dumb matter or energy or even "simply what is". What is, is LOVE! And why it is, is LOVE!
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to underestimate God's goodness. That is the key mistake here. God is not neutral as you might assume.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but also be careful not to develop a blaming victim complex on this issue. If you want a passionate job, you can work to create one based around your LP. It's challenging but worthwhile. Become a massive value provider, a powerful creator.

<p>
	The point of such abilities, besides the pure understanding of them, is to move mankind to greater self-realization.
</p>

<p>
	Altering the illusion is totally unnecessary. And yet if you could move more people to realize love, that would be the highest motivation, and you would do whatever is in your power towards that end.

<p>
	Yup, that accords with my own experiences with psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	At some point, after enough trips, you'll work through all of your personal psychological baggage and all that will remain are deeper and deeper levels of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	There is no one to heal because everything is Perfection. And, yet, the world is badly in need of healing. That's the paradox.
</p>

<p>
	Being a healer also does not require being a shaman or using psychedelics. The are many ways to heal the world. Just by talking to people about awakening is already healing the world. Just by raising your children well, that is helping to heal the world.

</p>

<p>
	It's said by some yogis that you need like 10,000 pranayamas to enter a deep samadhi effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
	I don't recall the exact number. It's mentioned in one of the books.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this number should not be taken too literally. It will differ for each person. But it gives you a rough idea of how many pranayamas you're aiming for. So do a shitload of them.

	You can look at an apple and see it as an apple.
</p>

<p>
	Or you can look at an apple and see it as not an apple.
</p>

<p>
	In both cases there is a round, red shape visible. But how you interpret that shape is very significant.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at an apple while letting go of your idea that it is an apple. Just stare at it in silence.

<p>
	So what? Big deal. If you can register a car, you can register a gun.
</p>

<p>
	How come I have to register my business with the IRS but not an arsenal of 20 assault rifles? It's absurd.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse registration with a ban on guns.
</p>

<p>
	Illegal guns will always exist, but requiring registration of all new firearm purchases would help eliminate young teens from buying up guns for their sprees. Many of these mass shooters purchased a firearm within weeks or months of their spree.

			Still not sure what they mean by gun show loop holes.  Anyone with an FFL license does a back ground check on every gun sale, does not matter if it is at a gun show, a store, or private.  I think this term was made up because it sounds like it means something but it really means absolutely nothing.

<p>
	Currently you can go to a gun show and buy a gun from a private party without any background check or waiting period whatsoever. It's absurd.
</p>

<p>
	These gun shows a very problematic. Back in the 90's I was once at a gun show where they were selling flamethrowers, grenades, body armor, and all sorts of other shady stuff. That particular gun show had to be closed because of how much illegal stuff was sold there. I'm sure that kind of stuff still goes on around the country. It's not hard to go to a gun show and purchase a firing pin which will turn your semi-auto AR-15 into a fully-auto.
</p>

<p>
	I have family members who were able to purchase grenade launchers at gun shows.

<p>
	No, just do it as long as humanly possible.
</p>

<p>
	It's very important that when you do your whole routine, that it be natural and organic. Don't waste too much mental energy criticizing yourself, timing things, analyzing yourself, etc. You must enter a flow state. The whole thing must become silky smooth and effortless. Let go of any self-conscious thoughts and just follow your heart.

<p>
	Because if I don't explicitly use such examples people will not understand that torture is Love. The ego will make exceptions to unconditional love, treating "evil" things as evidence that Love isn't unconditional. The fact is, anything which seems like it's not love is a lack of holistic consciousness and a judgment of the ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	When something happens to you in life which you hate, and you want to say, "But that's not love, that's evil." Be aware that in that moment, your vision is clouded by self-bias. You hate that thing because it conflicts with your survival agenda, not because it isn't Love.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There are many ways to corrupt even the highest of spiritual teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful to distinguish Advaita from Neo-Advaita. Neo-Advaita is a watered-down Western version which is popular nowadays on Youtube and elsewhere online because it is so simple and easy, but which grossly oversimplifies what enlightenment is. Neo-Advaita is dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all spiritual teachings get corrupted on a regular basis and very few people truly understand the full depth of the highest teachings. They stop far short because the methods they use are not very effective and they have no other way of knowing what they are missing. This is precisely where psychedelics become indispensable. Psychedelics can show you new aspects of awakening which you would have probably missed.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you've reached the end, chances are you're fooling yourself. So just be careful. Don't hesitate to dig deeper.
</p>

<p>
	The irony here is that there's not real contradiction. It's just a matter of depth and comprehensiveness of understanding.

<p>
	Just do the best you can, even if it's less than 90. The idea being that you will improve over time so it's not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
	Holding your breath to 90 is quite hard when you're holding all the 3 locks. Your body will get very tense and burn through more oxygen than usual.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Conventional human love, like romantic love, or love for your family, is like the tip of an infinite iceberg. You are conscious enough to realize love for only certain objects which serve your ego's survival. But once the ego is fully dissolved you realize that conventional human love was merely the tip of the iceberg. Then you realize that EVERYTHING is love.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest love you have for your family is the love God has for all of its creation. You as a limited human feel a tiny portion of that universal unconditional love. Most of the time you are disconnected from it because you are disconnected from yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	If you were fully conscious that you are God, your love would be infinite and totally unconditional. You would not even be able to think of anything other than love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is an Absolute and has no opposite. Feeling love is not necessary for Love to be at work. Love is at work even if you are torturing a puppy.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing you can do to shake God's love. You can be the most evil, egotistical, deluded person of all time, and God will still love you.
</p>

<p>
	Love is everything that has ever "physically" occurred, that you have ever known, seen, or felt. Love is every "physical" object.
</p>

<p>
	Love is Nothing.

	Actually, I have decided to unlock this thread so those of you who wish to vent can do so here. I imagine many will want to do so.
</p>

<p>
	If you have objections to the truth of God and Love, air your doubts and grievances with me now because going forward, God and Love will be the teaching. This is not something we can just sweep under the rug.
</p>

<p>
	Speak now or forever hold your peace.

	This attitude is overly-simplistic, overly-reductionistic, & misses a giant swath of the spiritual terrain.
</p>

<p>
	To teach spirituality and not teach the metaphysical nature of Love is incorrect not only from the standpoint of doing your students a disservice, but also from the standpoint of Truth itself.
</p>

<p>
	By shutting off your mind through self-inquiry, you've disconnected yourself from the very source and purpose of existence and awakening: LOVE. Love is not an emotion or feeling. Love is identical to Truth.
</p>

<p>
	This is the danger of Neo-Advaita and Neo-Buddhism as commonly taught in the West today. The nuances and depth of awakening is lost, reduced to a binary flatland.
</p>

<p>
	I have interacted with many enlightened masters. I was once told of the following case: A modern day Buddhist came to an enlightenment self-inquiry intensive, inquirying into the question of What am I? After a few days of intense inquiry he had an awakening to Absolute Love. But he immediately rejected the awakening as inauthentic because his Buddhist dogma led them to believe that Love is not a real thing. He was trapped in looking for Nothingness. This is a mistake. The Love is right there, yet you deny it.
</p>

<p>
	We are not really in disagreement here. There are just aspects of the Absolute you have not yet become conscious of because you've over-reduced it.
</p>

<p>
	I understand that some of you guys will disagree with me. But I can only lead you as best as I know how. Whether you want to follow is up to you. Nothing said here should be taken as dogma. Discover the many facets of the Absolute for yourself. Directly! Through no human source.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I have no problem with you guys doing psychoanalysis. My only point was that psychedelics will take you deeper than any talk-therapy will. But of course you're welcome to use them both. I support the use of multiple tools.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Here's the bare minimum that I would propose:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Federal background checks on all firearm sales
	</li>
	<li>
		Closing the gun show loop holes on private sales
	</li>
	<li>
		Ban of high capacity magazines
	</li>
	<li>
		Ban of bump stocks & other such mods
	</li>
	<li>
		Ban of body armor and armor piercing rounds
	</li>
	<li>
		Red flag laws
	</li>
	<li>
		Serious training and licensing in order to buy a gun at all. Like the DMV but for guns.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ban open-carry of firearms in public places
	</li>
	<li>
		Mandatory locks for all firearms
	</li>
	<li>
		Legal liability if someone accesses your gun to shoot a person when it wasn't properly locked
	</li>
	<li>
		Federal database of all firearms purchased and some kind of limits on people amassing arsenals.
	</li>
	<li>
		Waiting periods to buy firearms. A week or more.
	</li>
	<li>
		Ban mentally ill people or domestic abusers from owning firearms.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	All of this is totally reasonable and supported by the majority of Americans and even responsible gun owners.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this will not prevent all mass shootings. But it's a good idea to have these protections in place.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	This requires raising awareness of oneself through self-reflection, contemplation, inquiry, meditation, disciplined practices, etc.

It exists as a concept.
</p>

<p>
	In the same way that Santa Claus exists conceptually.
</p>

<p>
	Which is you say, the human self is imaginary. You are imagining that you were born. This a story you tell yourself to create a sense of self.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: just because you have a thought about something -- like Santa Claus living on Mars -- doesn't mean that thought refers to anything in the real world.
</p>

<p>
	So the question is: why you assume that body is "yours"? Why isn't that body the universe's?
</p>

<p>
	See, you've confused the universe and yourself. Or to put it more accurately: the universe believes it is a human. In the Absolute sense, there is only the universe believing it is a human. The universe is trying to act human to convince itself that it is human. But it's just the universe. The human part is imaginary.

	Unfortunately this is no minor disagreement. This goes against the core of my highest teaching.
</p>

<p>
	My highest teaching is:
</p>

<p>
	1) You are God
</p>

<p>
	2) Truth = Love
</p>

<p>
	This is what I am guiding you guys to realize.
</p>

<p>
	I don't want this teaching corrupted or made shallow with neo-Advaita or Buddhism or some Jed McKenna silliness.
</p>

<p>
	What I teach is distinct from all that.

<p>
	No. This is delusion.
</p>

<p>
	You need to access nondual states of consciousness to really grow. You have not even begun human growth until you've had your first mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't mean that all spirituality boils down to chasing mystical experiences, but you need some first hand experience of samadhi states.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not inclined to be spiritual then go watch some cartoons or whatever.

</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem with people is that they are so lazy and complacent they have zero mystical experience. They do not even know this domain exists. So they have no will to meditate seriously.
</p>

<p>
	I find that spiritually adept folks do not appreciate how unspiritual average folks are. Just keep that in mind. Because you walked this path sober you have an highly unusual degree of baseline awareness, wisdom, and motivation -- which 99% of people do not have.

<p>
	You are wrong.
</p>

<p>
	You have simply not awoken to what God or Love are.
</p>

<p>
	Emptiness is, ironically, just one facet of a much deeper thing which you have yet to access. You have not accessed it because self-inquiry is not a very effective tool to get there. And these various Buddhist and Neo-advaitan approaches which are popular today are fundamentally dogmatic and shallow. The realization of Emptiness and No-self is just the beginning of this work, which you have mistaken for the end.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not conscious that you are God and that you are imagining all of physical reality, your awakening is skin deep. And if you are not conscious that Truth and Love are identical, again, your awakening is skin deep.
</p>

<p>
	Everything I say here on this matter I have personally verified and become directly conscious of. And so have others before me.
</p>

<p>
	I have told you guys many times, you don't understand how deep this goes.
</p>

<p>
	If you do not want to follow my teachings to God and Love, then this is not the right place for you. This is not something I will compromise on. There is enough ignorance around here as it is to have to deal with supposedly awake people who deny God and Love. You can fool yourself, but you ain't foolin me.
</p>

<p>
	God's eye is watching you.
</p>

<p>
	You are being guided here to something far deeper than you yet understand. If you doubt that, by all means, do your own thing or follow some other teacher.
</p>

	That could happen. But the psychedelic helps to purify the mind, body, and heart. It's an incremental process of purification.

			It sounds like you only say it to be nice to those people that refuse to do them out of prejudice and fear, and to not make it sound like we need "drugs" to do this work. When in reality we are collectively in such a low state of consciousness that without psychedelics most of us are just gonna bang our heads against the wall for decades with little to show for it, and without even realizing we ain't getting anywhere.

<p>
	1) Things are under the universe's control. But luckily you are the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	2) Death is something you're imagining right now.
</p>

<p>
	3) Yes, you can break the chains of past and future by realizing that past and future are something you are imagining right now.
</p>

<p>
	Advanced alien beings might not have much of a government.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I don't imagine DMT machine elves have giant bureaucracies and empires. LOL. Although who knows?

Regression occurs when survival is severely threatened, but it should bounce back once the survival threat is handled.
</p>

<p>
	For an individual regression might happen if your business or marriage suddenly collapses.
</p>

<p>
	For a society regression might happen if there is a nuclear war or an economic depression.
</p>

<p>
	It also depends on how well established you are in a stage. If you're deep established regression will be much less likely than if you are just at the entry point of a stage.
</p>

<p>
	But generally speaking, a stage Yellow person is never going to regress to a stage Blue fundamentalist.
</p>

<p>
	This is an independent factor from Sprial Dynamics. I would call it a type, similar to masculine/feminine or personality types. A type should theoretically exist at any stage. But some types might be too limited to rise to the highest stages in practice. I doubt you can have a stage Yellow clinically retarded person.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that SD is a model which tracks averages. It will not address all the weird edge-cases of the human psyche. There are some serious freaks of nature who must be considered uniquely.

<p>
	Hard to say. He's definitely a very intelligent, highly developed stage Green at least. Probably some shades of Yellow, but also probably held back by the lack of knowing Spiral Dynamics and what Yellow even is.
</p>

<p>
	To really get into solid Yellow it's extremely important to learn Spiral Dynamics so one can explicitly see the whole Spiral at work in society.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Do you have any sense of whether it's possible to materialize a physical object through pure Will? Like a marble or a coin? And what is it that prevents this?
</p>

<p>
	I'm still trying to figure out the precise connection between Will and physical manifestation. I know that God's Will manifests all of physical reality, but I'm not clear why I don't have access to change it, since I am God -- what prevents this access?
</p>

<p>
	Any insights on that?
</p>

<p>
	And have you had any experience tapping into and shifting collective consciousness? Like the consciousness of the entire human species? Healing the species as a whole, for example.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	1) Were you born with paranormal abilities? Did you have them from a very early age? If not, how did you develop them?
</p>

<p>
	2) Do you believe that everyone can develop them? How do you account for the fact that most people have no paranormal experiences while paranormally gifted folks do?
</p>

<p>
	3) How do you understand the relationship between awakening and the paranormal? Clearly you can have one without the other. But also, how are they related?
</p>

<p>
	4) Why are some people so much more paranormally gifted than others?
</p>

<p>
	5) What is your understanding of psychic healing? How does it work? What makes it work? Why is it not always 100% effective? What is required to develop this ability to an effective level?
</p>

<p>
	6) List which paranormal abilities you've been able to personally validate and which ones not.
</p>

<p>
	But DPT is easier to find since its not explicitly banned in most countries.

<p>
	Psychedics are not required.
</p>

<p>
	However, I must be honest with you guys. Most of you are so lost in your minds and so unserious about doing concentration practices and/or yoga, that you will never grasp the deepest things I talk about without psychedelics. The psychedelics are recommended because you are not motivated enough to do the manual legwork.
</p>

<p>
	If you refuse the psychedelic path, you must work your ass off doing concentration practices and yoga.
</p>

<p>
	This dabbling bullshit does not work and you will waste years of time.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is the most hardcore pursuit that man can undertake. Start treating it as such. It will be worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Or just forget about spirituality and do basic self-help. You need to be very clear with your intent. What do you want? Do you really want Truth? If you do you should be willing to sell your mother into slavery to get it.
</p>

<p>
	It could, but I advise against such tactics as it will one day get you into hot water. People often redose too soon and end up getting in way over their head.

	If you want serious answers to such questions then your best bet is to ask them on psychedilcs.
</p>

<p>
	Verbal answers will simply not help you.

</p>

<p>
	The distinction between self/other is imaginary. So there are no individuals.
</p>

<p>
	This requires awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, LSD was showing you that. But you are not taking the contemplation seriously enough. Ask all your doubts when you are on LSD.

			Thanks for explaining, some of the things I already know. Yet, according to what we are taught here, tribes create dualities, it creates ego. The teaching of actualized.org contradicts that.

<p>
	Nothing is good or bad. It's all relative. There are healthy and unhealthy aspects to tribes. The unhealthy aspect is that they tend to go to war with each other due to an "us vs them" worldview.

<p>
	Your logic here is so warped I don't even know where to begin.
</p>

<p>
	Why is it that self-inquiry or meditation cannot do the simplest thing like teach you to play the violin?
</p>

<p>
	Do you see how absurd your logic is?
</p>

<p>
	1) Existential realizations have nothing to do with technical skill at manipulating the dream world. You are smart enough to know this.
</p>

<p>
	2) No therapist will teach you how to play a violin. This example is just absurd. It does a disservice to serious therapists to promise such results from therapy.

<p>
	Objective reality is all your imagination. Whatever God imagines is reality. If God imagines a chemical system, that chemical system will behave precisely how God imagines it behaves.

<p>
	It would be wise of you to actually watch my videos and to be on this forum to learn and not just teach, because your awakening and understanding of what reality is, is still surface level.
</p>

<p>
	You are not conscious yet of God or Love, and many other important facets of the Absolute. Nor have you had a psychedelic breakthrough, given the arguments you make.
</p>

<p>
	You are hallucinating this entire conversation. You are hallucinating your therapist. You are hallucinating chemistry. And you are even hallucinating psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	But you are NOT hallucinating God. You ARE God. The one who is hallucinating.
</p>

<p>
	All of your memories of having ever done psychotherapy are a hallucination. You're imagining it RIGHT NOW! Which is why it feels true. It's true because you (GOD) say it is.

People can have very different "brain chemistries" -- for lack of a better word, which is why people disagree so much about spiritual matters. It's not so simple as people merely being wrong or deluded. People are experiencing different territories and processing those territories in very different ways.
</p>

<p>
	Because there is no such thing as "the human brain". Each human brain/mind is unique. There can be a lot of overlap, but also a lot of divergence.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is way more complex than people make it out to be. It's easy to overlook this complexity when one sticks to a single orthodox school or teaching. But when you explore all schools, all teachings, all the edge cases, you start to see that it's not simple at all and there is no one path or single dimension to spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than thinking of spirituality as a single axis, think of it as a 3 dimensional volume. And even that might be oversimplifying it.
</p>

			Yes of course, but it's real to me now. And there in lies the dilemma. Can't surrender to death if the will to live is stronger. It may be obvious that there is no death from the other side of Awakening, but from this side it's still real and terrifying.

<p>
	How often does one breathe in insects that this is a problem??
</p>

<p>
	Although, funny story, when I was a kid on vacation in Mexico, as I was playing with my GameBoy a moth flew straight into my ear and got stuck there. It was buzzing around in there. Had to find a doctor to get it out.

<p>
	It's not right to compare them with MDMA. I don't experience much elevation in heart rate from 5-MeO-DMT or DPT.
</p>

<p>
	But of course taking them daily is overkill. No one is going to take those substances for more than a few days in a row. It just gets too intense. The most I've done was 13 days in a row, and it's just way more nonduality than a human could want.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I think that's generally true, but this notion of "absolute" is quite problematic because in practice you can be in a state of little to no self-involvement and yet not be conscious of important facets of reality. I prefer to think of these as somewhat independent variables, with both being desirable and both being synergistic. Insight helps overcome defilements, and overcoming defilements helps attain deeper insight into the metaphysics of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Historically it just seems pretty clear that there were gurus and masters who have had very deep metaphysical insight yet still plenty of defilements.

<p>
	That's simply explained by the fact that you identified strongly with your cat but not your relatives.
</p>

<p>
	When you own a small cat it feels like your baby and so you feel much more responsible for it.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, the meaning you assign to objects and people is purely relative and imaginary. So if you get attached to a coffee table, you will mourn its loss.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	Insight is the thing that allows you to even know what a defilement is. And insight is what gets you free of defilement.
</p>

<p>
	Desire for more insight certainly can become neurotic if you turn it into a rat race sorta thing. But it don't have to be that way.
</p>

<p>
	Make a distinction between healthy and unhealthy pursuit of truth and understanding.

<p>
	LOL
</p>

<p>
	You know not what you speak.
</p>

<p>
	When psycho-analysis allows you to contact machine elves and communicate with them through multiple dimensions of  symbolism and telepathy, or to get direct downloads from the mind of God, or to pull demonic spirits out of a patient's body, then let's talk. Playing violins is kindergarten stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You do not understand how psychedelics work.
</p>

<p>
	You do not even know what symbols truly are until you do some heavy tripping.
</p>

<p>
	To say that psychedelics are a "just a chemical" is a silly as saying that therapy is just a chemical. Everything is chemicals by that logic, including all symbols and your therapist. That therapist is just a soup of chemicals. This sort of selective, reductionist logic is a telltale sign of self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	I never said therapy doesn't work. Of course it works. But psychedelics work 1000x faster.
</p>

I was a hivemind I rather kill humans because that's a lot of food. If a was a lone ant I won't care cuz ants can't care.
