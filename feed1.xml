<p>
	I prepared a long ass video explaining all of JP's problems in painful detail. It is really a genius analysis.
</p>

<p>
	But I never shot it because people would flip their shit and call me judgmental and hypocritical and his army of trolls will swarm over me like flies on shit.
</p>

<p>
	So figure it out yourselves.
</p>

<p>
	JP is just a fad and a red herring. The perfect distraction from doing serious consciousness work. If you are following Actualized.org you should be way above that shit.
</p>

	There needs to be a JP Sears video where he is making stupid jokes to garner YT likes and then a Zen master slaps him cold across the face.
</p>

<p>
	The end.

<title>Did I See A Piece of Maya?</title>

<p>
	Maya is everything you see around you. Maya is the entire phenomenal world. Especially as it is seen by the dualistic, materialistic, survival paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	To make sure you aren't deluding yourself with mystical insights you gotta study and read a lot of different perspectives and cross reference the best sources.

<p>
	The really scary thing is that AI will NOT be just a PC sitting in an isolated room. It will definitely be given internet access and it will be installed by the military into planes, tanks, drones, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Even with just internet access, a smart AI will learn to:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Hack defense department computers
	</li>
	<li>
		Hack banks and steal money and Bitcoins
	</li>
	<li>
		Then use that money and Bitcoins to hire mercenaries, wage propaganda campaigns, dig up dirt on politicians and extort them, cause a stock market crash, secretly fund fundamentalist terrorist groups, etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If you think Russian troll farms are bad, wait till an AI steals $10 billion in Bitcoins and hires 5% of 3rd world population to work for it. The AI itself will not kill anyone. It will hire humans to do all of its dirty work in such a stealthy way that no one will even know an AI is in charge.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, for all we know, an AI was already in charge of starting the Iraq war, electing Trump, starting riots in Paris, popularizing Jordan Peterson and his army of incels, etc.
</p>

<p>
	That's rather shortsighted.

<p>
	An AI could be programmed to do something "nice" like solve global warming. And so what it might calculate is that the solution to that problem is to engineer an airborne ebola-like virus to kill off all humans.

	And that's just a very crude example of how AI will twist in on itself.
</p>

<p>
	Where things get hairy is when things get nonlinear and strange loops become possible.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to think about this: no human being is programmed to kill people. And yet it happens all the time. Because evil is the result of a survival drive. Once the AI acquires a survival drive -- and it will because the military will want robots who can kill terrorists while defending themselves -- then ego is born and all the evils that come with it.
</p>

<p>
	As they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Just because no one is going to deliberately program evil AI, the evil will come anyway. Because good and evil are subjective to begin with.

<p>
	What you don't realize yet is that metal and electrons are consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You are assuming some kind of fundamental duality between mind/body, which does not exist. That is materialism, and it is wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Your PC is already made out of consciousness. It just lacks the sophisticated structures necessary for self-reflection, and it lacks a survival drive.

			I'll give you a shortened version of a mess I typed up earlier,  AI is run from a computer program.  These computer programs consist of commands specific to the language, I usually see AI written in python.  While there are a lot of instructions that a computer receives, they are just instructions.  To be specific on what I mean by instruction, I mean they are pulling stored bits out of register files and putting those bits into some kind of circuit depending on the operation.  My point is just because AI gets really fucking smart, they are still defined by the presence or absence of electrons on a capacitor.  If you believe they are self-aware, then you can use the same logic to determine that Mario is very real and self-aware.  As a Mario player, my life depends on believing I am not killing an Italian plumber repeatedly, and instead am seeing a complex system of circuits and pipelines working in the way they were specified to work in.

<p>
	You are no more self-aware than Mario. In fact, you're more deluded than Mario. At least Mario does not believe he is real and in control of things.

	Google's chess AI -- Alpha Zero -- using non-linear neural networks has surpassed the best linear programmed chess program StockFish to be the strongest chess player in the world by, in only 4 hours. It does not use any pre-programmed rules or a library of chess moves. No one knows how it actually works because it is self-taught.
</p>

<p>
	A true AI will not be programmed in Python or anything like that. A true AI will be a non-linear system which is so complex no human will understand how it works. It will evolve itself. It itself will not know how it works. Just like how you -- a human -- do not know how you work.

<title>Curing acne through awareness?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/26994-curing-acne-through-awareness/?do=findComment&amp;comment=323756</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	In my experience stopping acne is almost exclusively about diet.
</p>

<p>
	Cleaning up your diet is super important.
</p>

<p>
	Certain types of foods cause lots of acne, especially processed foods, fast food, and really any food that you don't cook yourself.
</p>

<p>
	I eliminated 99% of my acne when I stopped eating all food expect food I made myself.
</p>

<p>
	I think a lot of the cheap oils & fats restaurants use cause lots of acne.
</p>

<p>
	Also stuff like whey protein causes lots of acne.
</p>

<p>
	Every body is different so you should experiment with an elimination diet to isolate which foods for you are the culprit.
</p>

<p>
	Heavily processed foods, snacks, fast food, and junk food tend to be worst culprits.
</p>

<p>
	I've found that if a food causes acne, it will cause it right within a few hours of eating it. So you need to closely watch when new acne appears and remember what you ate that day and never eat it again.
</p>

<p>
	Colloidal silver gets a lot of positive reviews for these purposes.
</p>

<p>
	That plus NAC, vitamin C, anti-oxidants, and beta-glucan.
</p>

<p>
	You must take all this as soon as you feel the cold coming on even a little bit. It doesn't work as well if the cold is already raging.
</p>

<p>
	But you'd have to experiment to see what works for you. People have different genetics and immune systems and it can be hard to sort out the placebo effect.

<title>Dave Asprey and bulletproof opinions ? Is he legit ?</title>

<p>
	I've experimented with it. You can certainly glean valuable health insights from Dave, but as far as his coffee goes and all that butter, I don't think it's too healthy long-term. I measured my cholesterol numbers before and after months of butter coffee and they got worse. So did my brother.
</p>

<p>
	Those results may hinge on genetic factors so you might be different. But make sure you get your cholesterol tested before and after your experiments with all that butter. In my experience, even the good cholesterol got worse.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of the Bulletproof brand stuff is overpriced and of questionable value. You'd have to carefully experiment with each product to see if it works for you.
</p>

<p>
	You can research more on his Bulletproof forum. Lots of people there talk about their experiences. Many of them are mixed.
</p>

<p>
	You would probably be better off not drinking coffee at all. It tends to become a crutch.
</p>

	It <u>is</u> studied in universities. Don Beck, the developer of Spiral Dynamics, was a professors at the University Of North Texas in Denton.
</p>

	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Edward_Beck</a>
</p>

<p>
	And there are hundreds of developmental psychologists around the world researching various developmental models.
</p>

<p>
	It's just not mainstream knowledge. Don't expect this stuff advertised to you on Facebook.
</p>

<p>
	Bachelors of psychology hardly know anything about how the human mind really works.
</p>

<p>
	Universities also have an aversion to anything mystical, which Spiral Dynamics points at with stage Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	Your key mistake is assuming that society spreads amazing things. Society mostly spreads the most dumbed-down, idiotic things. See my video: The Deep Problem Of Marketing
</p>

<p>
	It's precisely because Spiral Dynamics is so good that it is not spread.

<p>
	What's even more frightening is when you realize that once an AI gets as complex and sophisticated as a human mind, this AI mind will be susceptible to many of the same pathologies that human minds are susceptible to.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a Donald Trump AI that's pathologically hung up on its penis size (or lack there of).
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a white supremacist AI that's pathologically hung up on AI's being superior to all humans.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a greedy corporatist AI that's pathologically hung up on never-ending Wallstreet growth.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a Sam Harris AI that's pathologically hung up on turning everyone in the world into a rational atheist.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a Green Peace AI that's pathologically hung up on saving the polar bears by killing all humans.
</p>

<p>
	If an AI becomes as sophisticated as a human, you can expect it to have all sorts of irrational personality quirks.

<title>Are the percentages in Spiral Dynamics accurate?</title>

<p>
	Worldwide percentages are not as important as local percentages.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the average per capita worldwide salary is extremely low because certain underdeveloped countries are extremely underdeveloped yet have large populations. So a number like average per capita worldwide salary isn't a useful statistic.
</p>

<p>
	A much more useful statistic is the average salary in your neighborhood. That actually tells you something.
</p>

<p>
	In 1st world countries the percentage of stage Green is significantly more than 10%.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind that the higher the stage the more impact it has culturally, the less of it is needed. Even 1% Yellow or 0.1% Turquoise has a massive disproportional impact on the world. Because these people tend to be leaders and closer to positions of influence and power.
</p>

<p>
	Think of the impact of someone like Jesus, The Buddha, MLK, Gandhi, etc. You don't need 100 million Jesuses (Jesii?) to change the world.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	That's what most people mean by enlightenment or awakening.

	Imagine life just as it is but you were hit in the head with a baseball bat such that you can no longer form the thought "me". You are gone, but life goes on.
</p>

<p>
	You are an idea. This idea will stop arising.
</p>

<p>
	But that is only the realization of no-self. There is still more to realize. Like what God is. So it's not as bleak as the ego makes it seem.
</p>

<p>
	Don't buy into the ego's negative opinions about enlightenment. They are all delusion.
</p>

<p>
	This work requires a leap of faith in the end. You cannot know what will be discovered after ego-death. It is not imaginable.

</p>

<p>
	Don't take things so literally that: if a person teaches he has not reenterrd the marketplace because he does not "blend in".
</p>

<p>
	Obviously a professional nondual celebrity teacher will not blend in in the conventional sense.
</p>

<p>
	Picture 10 is a metaphor.

Lots of New Age books been written about that. You can also search "siddhis".

<title>Is a full logical understanding of no-self useful?</title>

<p>
	The moment of awakening IS the letting go of the self.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you can't truly let go of the self until you've let go of the self.
</p>

<p>
	You can't awaken before you awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Again, this is where psychedelics are extremely useful. It's like lube for the self to surrender.
</p>

<p>
	Why wait 5 years when you can get it in 50 minutes? Be smart about how you go about spirituality. Don't waste time doing things that don't work.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You are demoralized because you have not seen any tangible results. Because a tangible shift in consciousness usually takes several years of dedicated practice which you lack the vision to complete.

<p>
	With the opening of the 6th chakra (3rd eye) paranormal abilities can be unlocked. But this varies greatly from person to person. Some people will not unlock any paranormal abilities while others may unlock some significant ones.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I think it depends a lot on your brain chemistry, genetics, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This is all normal and can be part of process. Don't try to go chasing for paranormal abilities, but if they come to you naturally don't reject them either. You'll have to learn how to handle them responsibly. That in itself can be a long journey. You might want to read some books specifically about that.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different kinds of paranormal abilities and not everyone will access all of them. Most people will access none at all.
</p>

Which is why you gotta make yourself as independent of society as possible.
</p>

<p>
	It is harder in 3rd world countries but not impossible.
</p>

<p>
	You have to play the cards you've been dealt. Of course if you can move to a 1st world country then it's probably smart to do so.
</p>

<p>
	The internet makes 3rd world countries a lot more livable. You can run a $10 million dollar business from an apartment in India if you are clever.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest thing holding you back from success is simply your lack of vision and experience.

<title>What would a tier 2 society look like?</title>

Selfishness runs rampant even among highly woke people. People still need to survive because resources are limited. No one likes cleaning toilets, not even woke people. So survival issues and politics will always be a factor. When you only have 10 loafs of bread left, who's gonna get it?
</p>

<p>
	The greatest problem with Soviet style communism was that it did not properly account for human greed and selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	A stage Yellow or even Turquoise society would not eliminate these problems. They would only be lessened. A lot of infrastructure would have to be built up to support it.

The entire existing society must be evolved up to that level, which would take 100s of years at least, if not 1000s. No one guru can do it. Sheela was just one example of the problems that rise when trying to create such a society. There are thousands of others to take her place, and much worse. With ego, corruption is rampant and inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	And Osho himself set a bad example. He was an elitist, seduced by luxury.

<p>
	Relocate if you want, but don't make it an excuse for not developing.

Those types of communes always devolve and fall apart. They are not scalable to hundreds of thousands of people. They only work as sub-societies within the larger society. They don't have to deal with government functions like building roads, feeding the hungry, taking care of the elderly, policing white collar crime, protecting against polluted drinking water, a judicial system, printing money, and defending against hostile outside nations and dictators.
</p>

<p>
	Most people utterly take for granted how many functions the federal government does, without which you and family would be raped and enslaved.
</p>

<p>
	You can see just how easily a commune become corrupt by watching the Netflix Osho documentary, Wild Wild Country. And that's just the tip of the iceberg of how bad things would get if the government didn't shut them down.
</p>

<p>
	Green people are incapable of running a functional society without outside support from lower stages.

<p>
	Of course every perspective has some kernel of truth to it.
</p>

<p>
	But if you can't see the limitations of JP's philosophy that's because you're at his level of development/consciousness. He is teaching you exactly what your ego wants to hear.
</p>

<p>
	To those of us who have outgrown that, the limitations are all too obvious.
</p>

<p>
	But for you, at your level, JP may be appropriate. Until you butt heads with the limitations for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	JP's teachingd are very primitive after all the stuff that I have seen and studied. But primitive is a relative notion. What's primitive to one person is advanced to another.
</p>

<p>
	Understand that the logic being used to defend JP's philosophy is the same logic that is used to defend fundamentalist Christianity or Islam.
</p>

<p>
	That desire you have to help me with JP is actually an egoic projection of your desire to help yourself with JP. You are trying to convince me because you need to convince yourself. And the reason you feel a need to convince yourself is because fundamentally you are disconnected from truth and JP's dualistic judging paradigm is going to make that worse, not better.

	Not sure yet. These talks would not be as formal as my main videos. They would be more like my blog videos. More casual and off-the-cuff.

<p>
	The dates are still being decided, but they would be starting in January 2019 and through most of 2019, with each date roughly 2 weeks apart.
</p>

<p>
	Tentatively the locations would happen like this:
</p>

<p>
	Phase #1: San Diego, Phoenix, Seattle, San Francisco, Austin, Los Angeles<br />
	January-March
</p>

<p>
	Phase <span>#2: Houston, Dallas, Detroit, Chicago, New York</span><br />
	March-May
</p>

<p>
	<span>Phase #3: Miami, Tampa, Washington DC, Atlanta, Toronto<br />
	May-July</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Phase #4: Philadelphia, Boston, Cincinnati, St Louis, Montreal<br />
	August-October</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>Phase #5: Vancouver, Denver, Portland<br />
	October-November</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>------</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>The first two phases are fairly solid, the latter three phases are more iffy and uncertain.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>There will be an official announcement with a sign-up page once things are finalized.</span>
</p>

<p>
	<span>This would be the maximum number of cities I would do in 2019. Any other locations would be 2020 and beyond.</span>

<p>
	It is necessary if you want to be here talking about it.
</p>

<p>
	Death is not a problem, but then there is no form and no world and nothing to say.
</p>

<p>
	Surviving is utterly necessary from the POV of being a thing.
</p>

<p>
	We could not be here talking without it.
</p>

<p>
	The entire design is pure genius. Everything has its place, even all the "evil" stuff. It is the PERFECT design to maximize diversity of form.

Without intense physical pain you would have accidentally killed yourself long ago.
</p>

<p>
	People who cannot feel pain usually die very young.
</p>

<p>
	But that is very different from being so conscious that you can transcend pain.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is one of the best tools for spiritual growth. If you never suffered you would a lazy fat slug living in your mother's basement like Jabba the Hut. Suffering is what makes life feel so REAL. Otherwise it would just be a cartoon.

<p>
	The only way to get rid of growing through Tier 1 would be to genetically re-engineer the human brain so that it is automatically born with pre-programmed developmental structures.
</p>

<p>
	But at this point you would hesitate to call such people human.
</p>

<p>
	This kind of stuff will definitely happen in the future. But not in our lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	With genetic engineering all the rules of the game will get rewritten in shocking and unimaginable ways. Humans as we know them will cease to exist like old model-T Fords.

			What is then really wrong with the logical positivist movement, if you can get those basic facts right and build from there you will get an accurate model, no? Or are these basic facts than to some degree different for different perspectives?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There are no "basic facts". That assumes an objective external reality, which is a concept, not a fact. All forms and facts are relative. At the very least logical positivism is relative to you being human. A mule knows nothing of logical positivism and it is not true for him.
</p>

<p>
	Logical positivism was disproven long ago. Logical positivism is self-contradictory because it itself is not an emprical fact but a metaphysical belief.
</p>

<p>
	You can create models, but all of them will end in paradox and contradiction. None of them will explain reality as a whole because it is impossible for a model to do so.
</p>

<p>
	The linear mind cannot unfurl all of reality in a linear way. Because the linear mind is finite but reality is infinite. Reality is not collection of causes and effects, as science likes to assume.
</p>

<p>
	You are confused because the mind is trying to do the impossible: linearly rationalize reality.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate solution is to realize that this is impossible, and to instead transcend the mind through spiritual practices like Kriya yoga.
</p>

	Actually even "physical pain" is conceptual.

<p>
	Have all the thoughts you want. But take good care of your physical body.
</p>

<p>
	The ego mind will play all sorts of tricks when it gets cornered. Suicidal thoughts are just one trick up its sleeve.
</p>

<p>
	There is a long tradition of Dark Night of the Soul for mystics. A classic stage. I think the key to overcoming it is just to make a commitment to carry on with the work, suffer mindfully, and commit to not harming your physical body.
</p>

<p>
	No thoughts are to be taken seriously. That's also another trick. Do not buy into your own stories. All of that is ultimately delusion.
</p>

<p>
	And also always remember that reality is infinitely Good, Beautiful, Perfect, and Complete. Suffering is there because of the ego. You can learn to let go of suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said above, there is a proper time for it. No one is telling you to strategize everything all the time.
</p>

<p>
	At first your satori will be weak, so yes you will get sucked back into ego. That's why post-satori practice is required.
</p>

<p>
	Satori will profoundly change your life strategies.

</p>

<p>
	There is a time and place for both. When you are sitting on the cushion trying to attain satori, that's the wrong time to be strategic. That's a time to enter no-mind.
</p>

<p>
	Then there will be a time in your day or week to be strategic.

They have various repercussions.
</p>

<p>
	Criminalizing eating meat will simply not be a viable policy.
</p>

<p>
	Policy only works if it's viable in the long-run and actually creates a tangible improvement of some kind for the majority of people. Policies which lead to less efficiency will get weeded out by natural selection.
</p>

<p>
	You are free to have all sorts of beliefs and opinions about what will work best, but ultimately your ideas must be tested in the real world to see if they will actually fly.
</p>

<p>
	Someone who believes the white race is superior -- that's not gonna fly in the real world. Not in the 21st century.

<p>
	Those of you struggling with self-inquiry: it's almost impossible to do self-inquiry with a crazy monkey mind. You must first calm the mind down. For many people this could takes several years of meditation, as it did for me. Unless your mind is still and capable of extended periods of focus, self-inquiry will likely not work for you.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is very effective at mechanically silencing the monkey mind. Then you can do powerful inquiry.

</p>

<p>
	Since most people will judge us relatively, it's best not to give psychedelics a bad name. Otherwise it hurts the cause of making psychedelics more widely accepted. By using psychedelics sloppily, you ruin a good thing for other folks.

Anything decent will cost closer to $1300. And that's not downtown.

<p>
	No, I was lamenting the lack of maturity in the user.
</p>

<p>
	My talks on psychedelics are actually reserved.
</p>

<p>
	The issue is that no amount of disclaimers can stop ignorance from unfolding. Igorance is very creative and intelligent. If there's a way to fuck something up, ignorance will find it.
</p>

<p>
	It just never ceases to amaze me.

A lot about self-deception mechanisms. 
</p>

<p>
	Almost always both sides are self-deceiving. But the right-wingers moreso.
</p>

<p>
	Fox News is like a catalogue of fanciful self-deception tactics.

</p>

<p>
	The trick is to realize that your POV isn't important. After the self is gone there is no problem. The problem of death only feels real until death happens. After the self dies nothing bad can happen to you, because there is no you. You realize you were just an idea.
</p>

<p>
	Santa Claus cannot die because he is a fiction to begin with. But if Santa Claus believed he was real, the discovery that he is a fiction would feel like actual death to him. But all that ever dies is the fiction.

<p>
	Rent and housing in Austin is pricey. It was the fastest growing city and real estate market in the US for the last 5 years.
</p>

<p>
	Traffic gets pretty bad too because their highways are too narrow.

<title>Political systems in spiral dynamics stages</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Political ideologies are a reflection of one's values.
</p>

<p>
	Do not assume that everyone values fairness, equality, democracy, justice, truth, goodness, love, etc. These are very high values which very few people can live up to or even care about.
</p>

<p>
	The lower your stage of development & consciousness the less you care about those things, the more you care about only your own survival and your tribe's survival.
</p>

<p>
	All political systems reflect this.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you truly valued equality, you would have serious problems with capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	Just look at the values of each stage and then ask yourself, What political system would best reflect these values? And there you have it. The system we got perfectly reflects our real (not ideal) values.
</p>

<p>
	What confuses a lot of people is the ideals that political systems put forth, which are actually bullshit. Every political system tries to make itself out to be greater, more noble than it really is. Which is why you must look at the actions of the system, not its words. Then you see its true values.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic and you will see.
</p>

<p>
	It's being. Total presence for its own sake.
</p>

<p>
	The practical things are: all legit spiritual practices. Spirituality is the art of transcending self-survival.

</p>

<p>
	What are you really talking about when you say those words? Anything real? Anything actual? Or illusions in the mind?
</p>

<p>
	Try to point to one ACTUAL good thing.
</p>

<p>
	Try to point to one ACTUAL evil thing.
</p>

<p>
	Mapping stuff seems cool, but it is conceptual, not ACTUAL, and will likely lead you into self-deception. EVERY concept must be grounded in ACTUALITY if you wish to get closer to truth. It's way too easy for the mind to make shit up. So watch out.

<p>
	When done in a rigid Blue ecosystem like a monastery, mediation can keep you Blue.
</p>

<p>
	In practice Zen monks evolve to Turquoise on the spiritual/metaphysical line but remain underdeveloped on the other lines because meditation alone will not develop all lines.

<p>
	Let it unfold. Let your body do whatever it needs to do.
</p>

<p>
	Shake it out.
</p>

<p>
	And carry on with your practice.
</p>

<p>
	Do not get distracted by things like this. Your goal is Truth/Awakening.

<p>
	Of course science has shown centuries ago that all is interconnected, even long before quantum mechanics.
</p>

<p>
	The issue is that it does not fit the modern atheist paradigm, so it is all conveniently forgotten about.
</p>

<p>
	Newton was a deist.
