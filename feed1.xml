<p>
	Well, of course that's the case. But I wasn't even going to that absolute level.

<p>
	Femininity still uses mind. It just uses it in different ways. Feminine mind, masculine mind, kangaroo mind, alien mind.

<p>
	Indeed

<p>
	We need to move towards one person, one vote, and seriously raise taxes on the wealthy and giant corporations, and break up monopolies, and ban lobbying, and publicly finance elections.

<p>
	These basic changes would solve most of the problems.

<p>
	The name of their game is to be very right-wing but make it look tempered and reasonable.
</p>

<p>
	Sort of like how George W Bush was a "compassionate conservative". Almost every right winger has to draw a line between themselves and Nazis because it's just too blatantly hypocritical to be aligned with Nazis. And frankly, most of today's conservatives are more evolved than Nazis so they aren't wrong to draw that line.

<p>
	They don't conflate that. They separate themselves from the far-right. As gross as Prager is, even he would denounce Nazis and holocaust deniers and racism (I hope).

	To be fair, his analysis is pretty sloppy.

<p>
	I'm starting to regret linking to him the more I watch his stuff. He's conflating all conservatives with fascists, which is just dumb. Classic Green trap. Find a better source.

	Well, to be fair, by this logic cops shouldn't stop DUIs and all medicine should be sold over-the-counter.
</p>

<p>
	Government has always controlled what you can put in your body. Altering one's chemistry is dangerous stuff when done by fools.
</p>

<p>
	And we certainly need leaders. As a leader himself, it's funny how Hancock doesn't understand the importance of conscious leadership.

<p>
	Wait till you realize that reality has infinite resolution.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that your visual field has infinite resolution. There are no pixels, contrary to what science told you.

<p>
	A brilliant example of how stage Blue/Orange (Bolton) got duped by stage Red (Trump).
</p>

<p>
	Bolton thought Trump was Orange, only to discover that Trump was actually Red.
</p>

<p>
	This is where the power of Spiral Dynamics really shines. Once you know it, you'll never get duped like this.

</p>

<p>
	And they aren't wrong for doing that, per se. Most conservatives are not holocaust deniers or white supremacists.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that both sides make fine distinctions of their side and almost no distinction among the other side. To a conservative, all progressives are radical Maoist communists. To a progressive, all conservatives are fascist, racist, neo-Nazis. And thus nothing gets resolved.

	It makes no difference what sensation you focus on. I use visual examples because most of us are highly visual creatures and our visual fidelity is highest.

	Plenty of Zen masters got enlightened by focusing on sound. Sound can be an excellent meditation target. As can bodily sensations like pressure or breathing.

			but then there's a new discovery saying that if you repeat the word "banana" 100 times, it will somehow affect your basal ganglia, which is responsible for habits, and all of your bad habits will be gone (a VERY absurd example, which is not true at all <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />) I just want to get my point across that people will believe it more when it is backed by proof of the brain.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In this case the only way you'll know if it's true is if you do the action and test it for yourself. Say banana 100 times and see what happens.
</p>

<p>
	Without doing that, notice, all you have a belief. The science could turn out to be false. This happens often.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, we can talk about brains as long as we remember that we are talking about a relative, imaginary construct of the mind. We can talk about conceptual stuff but the key is not to get lost in our concepts and start confusing them for reality.
</p>

<p>
	Again, you have to be extremely careful with how your mind weaves strong imaginary narratives such as: "To optimize my sleep I must change the brain and the brain is a real organ, etc." << all that is relative stuff.
</p>

<p>
	"The brain" is a conceptual narrative which grounds your entire sense of reality. Which is why it's so difficult for your to shake free of it. You see, you've hinged your very life on it. So this puts you in an existential bind. If you question the brain too much, you will lose a piece of yourself. Some part of you will die. And you don't want to die.
</p>

<p>
	To you, reality comes from the brain.
</p>

<p>
	To a Muslim, reality comes from Allah.
</p>

<p>
	To a kid, Christmas gifts come from Santa Clause.
</p>

<p>
	All these are imaginary constructs to which we grow attached and which are difficult to let go of because they are so fundamental to our worldview. If Santa Clause is imaginary, where do gifts come from? The kid is confused. He does not yet know the true origin. That takes work to discover.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You might be surprised to learn that most elites don't identify as being elites. "Elites" is a notion that normies invented in many ways.
</p>

<p>
	I don't wake up every morning thinking to myself, "I'm an elite". But some normie might think of me as an elite if he sees my bank account. Often times an "elite" is just a passionate, hard working person doing his best to help the world as he sees fit.

		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	The fundamental problem I have with conspiracy theories is that they misunderstand the motivations of people. They tend to ascribe evil motives to people without recognizing that all humans, be they normie or elite, are acting out of what they think is best for the world.
</p>

<p>
	What needs to be understood is that when a normie wakes up in the morning and goes to work, he thinks he's doing something good. And when an elite wakes up in the morning and goes to work, he thinks he's doing something good.

	But how did his family get it to begin with?
</p>

<p>
	Of course later generations can free-load off the wealth of their ancestors. And in such cases the wealth quickly gets lost. Trump lost daddy's $400 mil. He would be richer if he just put all that money into a bank CD.

<p>
	Well... don't ask me. Look at what is true.

<p>
	You can optimize your sleep without needing to appeal to some metaphysical notion of a brain. In the same way that you can eat a banana without needing to bring to mind the atoms which you imagine it is made of.
</p>

<p>
	Chimpanzees have been eating bananas for a million years without knowing anything about atoms. You can read about atoms, but don't confuse atoms for a banana. Atoms are imaginary. And just because atoms are imaginary does mean that you cannot now optimize how you eat bananas.

<p>
	You are supposed to think: "Is that psychologist in the room with me? No? Then he's imaginary! And so is his bullshit scientific explanation."
</p>

<p>
	You are going to have to seriously question the foundations of science here. Science is not true as you were led to believe. Science contains some partial and relative truths, but it cannot grasp Absolute Truth, Consciousness, or existential questions. Science cannot ever tell you what you are. This is a meta-scientific question. Science cannot tell you what anything is in the absolute sense. Science can only make relative comparisons between things. Science cannot ever get at the thing itself.
</p>

<p>
	For example, science cannot tell you what red is, or what a chair is, or what matter is, or what energy is, or what time is, or what a number is. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that science has never given you a bottom line answer about what ANYTHING is! Start to wonder why that is.
</p>

			Ok, these last days I kept on doing the self inquiry about who I really am and I keep on coming back to the brain. The one who generates the thought, the one who processes the information, the one who's aware of everything. I can not pin point directly which part of the brain I am, but I consider all of it to work together and makes up who I am because if for instance, let's say the amygdala is taken away, then some emotions will also be gone, but I will still be there. If someone shoots me in the brain then Im gone.

<p>
	Dude! Cut the shit.
</p>

<p>
	There is no brain in your direct experience. You've never seen your brain. Notice that.
</p>

<p>
	This work is 100% about sticking to what is present in your direct experience. If it's not in your direct experience it does not exist. That means the back of your head does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	You need to be ruthless here about noticing what is actually present in direct experience vs whatever your mind is imagining.
</p>

<p>
	You are imagining your brain right now. Notice this. This is not a theory. This is literally what is happening in your experience. Take your finger and point at the brain and notice if the pointer is pointing to nothing.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what your mind is saying, you must look strictly at what exists in direct experience. The mind is constantly imagining all sorts of fantasies. You must not fall prey to them.
</p>

<p>
	Is your mother in the room with you right now? No? Then she does not exist. That's what is literally true. The rest is fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	The whole trick here is to not believe your own lying mind. Your own mind is constantly lying to you because it is constructing reality. You have to catch the mind in the act of construction, and stop it. Otherwise you will forever be living in a self-constructed fantasy while thinking you are looking at reality.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously. This is true by definition.
</p>

<p>
	The thing you have to take into account, though, is whether maybe they deserve that power. The reality is that some people are much better leaders than most, and are much more visionary, talented, capable, educated, hard working, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying that Bill Gates deserves $100 billion because he worked a billion times harder than his employees. But you have to admit, Bill Gates is an exceptional leader and visionary who accomplished things that very few normies could. So of course he has more wealth and power than a normie.
</p>

<p>
	And I would offer the following point which most populists will find hard to swallow: Bill Gates is more developed than the average person and he actually uses his wealth and power in a more responsible way than a normie would. If you give $100 billion to a normie they will get corrupted by it and use it for all sorts of selfishness and evil. I think most normies don't appreciate how evil Bill Gates could be if he really wanted to with that amount of wealth and power. Bill Gates is an exceptionally developed person relative to the national average.

<p>
	To some degree. But largely what normies believe is not so much dictated by elites as it a function of collective cultural forces which are beyond the control of any one individual elite, or even a well organized group of elites.
</p>

<p>
	And also, elites themselves do not control what elites believe. Elites themselves are products of their culture which they are nearly powerless to stop.
</p>

<p>
	The boundary between elites and normies is not so clear-cut.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, but this is a generic problem of the mind which will not be fixed by dethroning elites. A mob of normies could be even more cult-like because it has no sensible leadership.
</p>

<p>
	In many situations a small group of highly educated and talented elites is far preferable to a mob of ignorant normies. Which is precisely why elites have a lot of power. You have to wonder, how did they get it to begin with? They got it because they were more effective than a mob of normies.
</p>

<p>
	A small team of 10 highly exceptional and ambitious people is superior in effectiveness to a mob of 100,000 mediocre people. To distribute power evenly across those 100,000 people could actually create a disaster.

	How to get a girlfriend:
</p>

<p>
	Step 0: Stop fucking whining and making excuses.
</p>

<p>
	Step 1: GO OUT and talk to girls in real life. And keep fucking doing it regularly.
</p>

<p>
	Step 2: Snuggle after sex.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Also works: become a successful leader who offers massive value to the world, and girls will come to you begging. This is actually the most powerful way. But most guys are too lazy and incompetent to do it.

<p>
	This is just not true. You see it that way because you lean conservative and so that's part of your mind's confirmation bias.
</p>

<p>
	Plenty of radical lefties get censored too. In fact, in any given society, radical lefties are more censored than right wingers because the right wingers are aligned with the status quo while radical lefties risk the threat of upsetting the status quo and getting killed for it.
</p>

<p>
	History is full of radical lefties getting killed for their progressive ideas and values, and getting censored.
</p>

<p>
	As but one example, in American history, socialism has been demonized and censored A LOT over the last 70 years.
</p>

<p>
	Progressives are routinely kicked off the air on mainstream media channels like CNN and MSNBC. News anchors who were strongly against the Iraq War, for example, were routinely fired at MSNBC because their views were bad for business. There is a lot of incentive for businesses to censor progressives because progressives often challenge the business's drive for unchecked profit.

	In all areas of life, fit-ness is key. Things which do not fit together cannot work in the long-term. Screen harder for fit on the front end. You should be screening girls harder for what you want.

<p>
	Worrying about it isn't going to solve the problem.
</p>

<p>
	If you're serious, start independently contemplating life. You will never reach quality understanding without thinking tons of things through deeply for yourself in your own free time.
</p>

<p>
	True understanding requires going above and beyond anything that any human can tell you.

	The trick with Green is that it's easy for young people to start parroting the Green value system without themselves being solidly at a Green stage of development. They are Green in a shallow, immature way. Often as an ideology, not as a stage of development. I've discovered that there's a big difference between lite, immature Green vs solid, mature Green.

			What I'm aware of is most guysÂ are actually what my 2nd girlfriend wanted. The are usually super dirty, love oral sex and super horny and masculine. Most girls want this too. But I'm different. I tend to value intimacy, spiritual connection, emotional connection, love, romance, caringness, "experiencing her soul", etc. During sex. I like to take things super slow, super relaxed and chilled, super deep emotionally, make her cry, make her feel really loved, make her feel really cared for. And the pleasure adds to that. My favourite part of the porn section is the 'romantic' section. The dirty section turns me off.
		</p>

		<p>
			It doesnt feel right to try and be more horny, dirty, if its not who I authentically am. yet at the same time most of society are horny and dirty and not like me. So how do I go about satisfying the general population? Given 'the cards I've been dealt with', I'm gonna ask the age old question, how do I fit in when it comes to sex?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is a quality problem.
</p>

<p>
	The intimate kind of sex you offer is gonna be very powerful once you find the right girl who can appreciate it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't fit in, find a girl who fits what you're dishing out. Then magic will happen.
</p>

<p>
	What you're offering is actually something many girls dream about but can never get from a normal guy. So this raises your value.
</p>

<p>
	Probably the #1 complaint girls have about guys is that they aren't intimate enough. Because most guys fear intimacy. Intimacy requires higher development and consciousness than dirty sex does. Although ideally you weave the two together.

	It's gonna happen, which is why you gotta pace yourself well, for the long-haul. Treat psychedelics as a marathon, not a sprint. Space out your work over years. If you try to bull your way through with psychedelics you will burn yourself out.

	Saying that Krystal Ball works with fascists is too much. Vaush is doing himself a disservice by being so uncharitable.
</p>

<p>
	Krystal simply has a populist ideology. She's obviously not sympathetic to fascists.
</p>

<p>
	Both sides are mischaracterizing each other.

What do you think of this new nation?

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not a new nation. It's just some folks staging a social experiment which will soon peter out.
</p>

<p>
	There is no serous threat from it.
</p>

<p>
	The normal protests around the country will have way more lasting impact on reform than this CHAZ thing.
</p>

<p>
	Progressives need to be careful not to freak out conservatives too much with extreme examples. It makes the conservatives more paranoid and discredits the intelligence of progressivism.
</p>

<p>
	I think the biggest challenge for progressives to accept that society simply cannot evolve as fast as they want it to, because at least 50% of the population leans towards the familiarity and comfort of traditional systems. Society can only evolve as fast the lower 50% can evolve.
</p>

<p>
	Counter-intuitively, when you are so eager to change a system that you propose radical changes, this ends up making the changes impossible to implement and leads to the system not changing. Changes need to be progressive-leaning but still tolerable to normies. It's a difficult balance to strike. It's sort of like as a kid, trying to convince your parents to buy you a new toy. If you ask for the best, most expensive toy in the store, you will go home with nothing.

<p>
	This is a good look at the problems with Krystal and Sagaar's Rising show:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tSscmRbAiLQ?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	I don't agree with the bad motives that Vaush ascribes to Krystal and Sagaar, but he does make some good points about how they over-emphasize populism and ascribe conspiratorial motives to corporations and elites.
</p>

<p>
	I see this popular trend of blaming everything on corporations and "elites", which fails to understand the true depth of the problem. Corporations and elites are often more developed than the ignorant populist masses how demonize them.
</p>

<p>
	Populism is turning into a toxic ideology. Just pointing this out to those of you who are jumping on the populism bandwagon.
</p>

<p>
	What Vaush and Krystal and Sagaar all don't understand is that corporations don't just act out of a desire for money. Corporations are evolving too! A corporation like Amazon, Facebook, or Google has many stage Green employees who will stage an uprising if the leadership isn't supportive for progressive Green causes. And also, the leadership of these corporations also tends to be progressive. For example, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook is himself gay, so obviously he's gonna want Apple to be supportive of gay rights. That's not corporate pandering, that's actually corporate evolution. A company as evolved as Apple cannot be anti gay because many of their loyal customers are stage Green.

	Conservatives are having a field-day with this CHAZ thing. But their critiques are from below, not above.
</p>

<p>
	This CHAZ thing makes conservatives feel like their position is intelligent.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that the bulk of the conservative play-book is to seize on any extreme example of liberalism, blow it totally out of proportion, and then fear-monger about it as if moving in that direction will be the end of the world.
</p>

<p>
	This is FoxNews' bread and butter. The demonization of Green by latching on to the most extreme, fringe examples. There's no desire to understand the Green POV. Because if it was truly understood, one would realize it's more conscious and humane than Blue or Orange.

<p>
	There is no baseline. It's bottomless and empty. Whatever is happening in your experience right now is the totality of what is.
</p>

<p>
	Without hallucination, there isn't any form. Objective reality is just a consistent kind of hallucination.

<p>
	Consensus is something you're also imagining, since you imagine all others too.

<p>
	Just be aware that pickup people have an extremely skewed and self-biased perspective on dating/marriage/relationships. A very immature perspective.
</p>

<p>
	You can learn things from the pickup perspective, but it can also rot your mind if you're not careful.

<p>
	That's not what was implied.

<p>
	Don't confuse who one would have a baby with vs being around females.
</p>

<p>
	Love does not mean that you will have a baby with any random person. Sexual preferences are a highly personal thing. That's all my message was pointing out. It's okay if your sexual preferences are very specific.

			But any kind of shooting should be legitimate in terms of self defense. The obligation to punish for an offense lies with the court. Police are merely handlers and catchers.

<p>
	But the point is, piloting can be done by a computer. Policing cannot.
</p>

<p>
	That analogy fundamentally misunderstands the challenges of policing. It cannot be done algorithmically. And the pilot's life is not in danger by the passengers. The pilot wants to not fly into mountains precisely because it aligns with his survival. A cop being nice to criminals is dangerous to his survival.
</p>

<p>
	If drunk people broke into the cockpit on a regular basis, pilots would shoot them.

	As a culture a consensus will grow about the limitations of Blue and Orange, opening up to a Green worldview and value set.
</p>

<p>
	This is already happening, as we see in the news. Racism, for example, is becoming impossible to maintain in public without shame. Endless capitalism is starting to be questioned and shamed too.

<p>
	Pretty soon the Wall Street types will be ashamed of their work as their peers start to see them as devils.

<p>
	Stop assuming any of that requires a brain. It occurs in the current moment as phenomena. It occurs in your consciousness, obviously, since that's where you find it.
</p>

<p>
	A video game character can do all those things without a brain.

	What you should be wondering is how some pink colors can think, learn, meditate, remember, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is not in the brain, the brain is in your mind. And mind is nowhere, nohow, and nothing.

<p>
	That's why globalism is so important and inevitable. Governments and democracy will need to interconnect more deeply between nations. The boundaries between nations will have to blur to the point where eventually Earth will look like a United States -- where the boundaries between states are pretty soft and unimportant.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this will take centuries to accomplish because people are so xenophobic, closedminded, nationalistic, and selfish. But a more integrated global government will create huge synergies, efficiencies, and far greater equality.
</p>

<p>
	True democracy cannot exist on this planet until it makes little difference which nation you are born into, in terms of your opportunity and rights. We are very far from this ideal. Many systems need to change for this to happen.

<p>
	A simple way to explain it is like this:
</p>

<p>
	If you cut open the skull of a video game character, you will see a "brain" there (if the designers programmed it that way). But that thing is not at all what is controlling the video game world. Perception in a video game is NOT coming from the avatar's brain or body. The brain/body is just part of the entire simulation which does not hinge on any one part within that simulation.

	Science certainly has biases in it. Biases at the epistemic level, metaphysical level, and then at social and cultural levels.

	Weinstein doesn't understand the relativity of science and materialism. Therefore he doesn't understand Post-Modernism and why it is challenging STEM.
</p>

<p>
	The epistemology and metaphysics of STEM needs to be questioned and deconstructed, and you're not going to stop that from happening no matter how hard you try. This is fundamentally what people like JP, Weinstein, Sam Harris, etc. do not understand.
</p>

<p>
	STEM and academia will never get shut down. They are just being questioned.

<p>
	Because you're not in a position to appreciate the depth of the questions you're asking.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious you will need to spend years and perhaps decades carefully contemplating and deconstructing all this.
</p>

<p>
	You are basically asking, "How does reality happen at all?" and the answer to that question is so radical that if you knew it, it would kill you.
</p>

<p>
	Watch more of my videos and contemplate them deeply. Nobody is going to give you these answers. You must have major awakenings to understand.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is playing a game with you. It is imagining reality, and it will do everything in its power to make sure you never become aware that you are constructing reality, because otherwise reality will disappear. Your very life hinges on it.

			I'm not sure if you guys will accept this story and IÂ certainly <strong>don't </strong>promote such behavior, but I just have an itch to tell someone how I feel for a change.
		</p>

		<p>
			Letting go was always something very hard for me. I am always tense and rigid, overthinking and anxious. I am neither comfortable alone, nor when around people.
		</p>

		<p>
			When out with a group, I was alwaysÂ the quiet one who couldn't hold a conversation and wouldn'tÂ speak unless asked something. I have always been more inside my own head than anywhere else.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have a mortal fear of beautiful girls and every time someone I liked showed an interest in me, I either ignored her or actedÂ like a complete douche (and no, that doesn't make girls like you more). One very interesting thing I noticed is how very long it can take before a girlÂ loses interest in a rigid, awkward ball of insecurities like me. These creatures are persistent, aren't they...
		</p>

		<p>
			I was strictly against drinking and clubbing.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've always thought that "such shallow and spiritually-empty activities are not for me".
		</p>

		<p>
			Also me: binging on tons of porn, porn and more porn.
		</p>

		<p>
			Such a cretin, I know.
		</p>

		<p>
			At one point I realized in how much of a tangle I've gotten myself. I was tired, I just wanted to let go.
		</p>

		<p>
			And so I grew curious - what would happen if I just went out there?
		</p>

		<p>
			We sat to drink with some friendsÂ and I steadilyÂ began realizing how easy it actually is to let go. Easiest thing in the world, in fact.
		</p>

		<p>
			Yet why wasn't I able to pull it off while sober?
		</p>

		<p>
			Then we went to the club.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>I danced.Â  For like, 4Â hours.</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Holy shit did that feel good! My whole life I've beenÂ a stiff stick. The only dance moves I knew were nervous gestures. When around people I always felt sort of paralyzed, uncomfortable inside my own body. But last night I lost myself into the loud music and the colorful lights. I surrendered completely. I was perfectly aligned with the present moment and allowed myself to be carried away by it.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've never felt so free. I sensed my karma shedding.Â I learned from this experience and I will make my best to embody such carefree-ness to my day-to-day sober life.
		</p>

		<p>
			I would never substitute such hedonism for an actual spiritual discipline, of course. I will certainly do it again, but I'll always perceive it as a stepping stone towards something deeper.
		</p>

		<p>
			My message with all this, I guess, is: Have the courage to open your mind and try out things you've never even imagined yourselfÂ doing, but also be careful. And above all - let go.
		</p>

		<p>
			Thank you for reading this random story. I appreciate all opinions and criticisms.
		</p>

		<p>
			Love you all and good luck with everything!

<p>
	There's yourÂ answer in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that no care enough to actually know things. So hardly anyone knows anything. The mind is simply closed.
</p>

<p>
	My only secret has been total openmindedness and desire to know. It sounds simple yet only one in a billion people does it.

<p>
	If you actually cared enough you would be the wisest person in the world. But you don't care enough.

			But if someone cuts my skull open there will be a brain, right? How am "I" able to think if there was no brain? I have also had a minor accident at the gym and nearly every single I experience pain, if I didn't have a brain, how am I able to process pain? How are we able to learn things if there was no brain? Sorry for so many questions, but that statement "there is no brain at all" is a total mind fuck. Obviously, I'm not going to cut my skull open to see if I really have a brain cause I'll probably be dead (the lowercase self)Â <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" /> but we saw surgeons cutting skulls open of a human being and he/she in fact has a brain.Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			What are you suggesting what is in our skull if not a brain?Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			I really hope that I don't come across as hostile and trying to prove you wrong, that's not what I'm doing at all...I'm really interested in this and have watched many many of your videos and have also started meditating 25 minutes every single morning for the last week. Actually been meditating since 3-4 years, but haven't taken it seriously to the enlightenment level like recently. Also, been doing self inquiry as well. But again, your statement that we don't have a brain is a real mind fuck and sounds hmm...I mean, it has been proven that we have brains... we have blood that is running in our body, right? or is that also not real? Be honest with me Leo, if someone dissected your skull right now, there would be a brain right? Let's just say we really don't have a brain, then how are we able to process things and gain knowledge and all of that?Â 
		</p>

<p>
	See my video: Why Brains Do Not Exist
</p>

<p>
	If you cut open the skull you will see some pink stuff in there. Which is color, not really a brain. Your "brain" is made out of color. So what is color? Do not make the naive mistake of thinking that color is something which happens in the brain. NO! Brain happens in color.
</p>

<p>
	Your notion of "brain" is highly metaphysically loaded. By that term you don't just mean color, you use it as an anchor for your entire reality. This anchor needs to be deconstructed to see that it is nothing more than some color, not different than the colors your floor is made of.

			First of all, thank you Leo for taking your time to answer me personally, I feel honored!Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			Secondly, there are days where I think that I have got it when I'm totally detached from my thoughts and I'm just being aware of them, just observing and not being subjective. Since all of this is still new, I have to CONVINCEÂ myself that I'm not my brain because my entire life I thought I was because everything is being processed in the brain (that was my belief) isn't the awareness happening in the brain though, Leo? Also, a state is happening from the brain as well, no? As you can see, my theme revolvesÂ around the brain and I have identified myself with it. I mean, there are a lot of parts in the brain, like amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, etc. and all of them have their specific purpose and so all of that makes up who "I" am. Perhaps awareness is also happening in one of the parts of the brain? Can it be possible? Like the thoughts is happening in one part of the brain (I'm assuming, can't be entirely sure) perhaps awareness is happening in one part or all of the parts combined together?Â

<p>
	Right... you are trapped in the materialist myth of brains and physical objects. It is good to question and deconstruct that. But that's only the begining.
</p>

<p>
	There is no brain at all. The brain is just a story you invented to explain the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	Thoughts don't happen in a brain. The brain is a thought. Take a close look at what "my brain" really is and where it came from. Deconstruct it. Raw experience is not happening inside of any thing.

	You are EVERYTHING. The entire field of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with your ideas of Nothingness. Whatever ideas you have of it are not it.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not about becoming convinced of something. Awakening is not a logical conclusion or a belief. It is a new state of consciousness. You need to access a new state, rather than trying to convince yourself from within your current state.

Some trips requires weeks or months of integration while others don't. There are so many factors. You gotta be patient and intuitive about it. Don't re-trip too soon if you're still not done processing the previous trip.

<p>
	Of course that's a nice ideal. But the reality is that if you want every cop to have several years of training then you're gonna have to double or triple their budgets.

<p>
	The more rigorous your process, the fewer people will become cops and the more pay they will demand.

<p>
	Just because you can access a certain high state of consciousness thru meditation or yoga does not mean that you can access the full range of states that consciousness is capable of. You will miss 99% of possible states that way, and as a result your understanding of consciousness will be limited.
</p>

<p>
	There is no substitute for states. States are all there is. There are states which you cannot even imagine and which cannot be described in language or even stored in human memory once you've been there.

Obviously enlightenment is possible without psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	But enlightenment does not give you access to anywhere near the full range of states that consciousness is capable of. An enlightened person cannot access what DMT or salvia can give one access to, for example.

This is some bullshit invented by online trolls and keyboard jockeys.
</p>

<p>
	Go out, meet women, date, and follow your life purpose. Stop caring what meme-y label some fool uses to define you. To even seriously consider such ideas a "SIMP" is already an insult to your consciousness and humanity.

<p>
	It's not that it's fluid, it's just that you're not aware of it deeply enough yet.
</p>

<p>
	It takes years of self-observation work to start to become aware of one's own personality. This is counter-intuitive because you probably expect that since the personality is yours that you should have full awareness of it. But of course that can't be the case without a lot of self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
	You don't know what your face looks like precisely because you're too close to it.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Meditation still has enormous value because you cannot be hopped up on psychedelics all the time. Psychedelics should be done rarely. Like 1-5% of your life. The other 95%+ of the time you will be sober and you'll want to boost your sober state with manual techniques like meditation or yoga.
</p>

<p>
	Regardless, you need to develop the ability to just sit and do nothing for 60 minutes straight, and to concentrate your mind for 60 mins straight. These are crucial skills to develop for anyone doing self-actualization.

<p>

<p>
	I can confirm that it is certainly impossible.
</p>

<p>
	You ain't gonna reach a salvia or DPT state even after 40 years of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics states are so intense, powerful, and diverse that you will never access all of them without pumping your brain full of new chemicals.
</p>

<p>
	Through meditation perhaps you can access 1% of the full range of psychedelic states.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't make meditation bad. It's still an important practice. But don't fool yourself into thinking you'll access a DMT, DPT, or saliva breakthrough via meditation. You will not. Also, don't confuse ego-death, samadhi, and awakening with the full range of possible states of consciousness. The range of states that consciousness can take is astounding in its diversity and intensity.

<p>
	I took the 16personalities one and long time ago I had a professional evaluation done. Both results came out the same. It's very accurate for me.
</p>

<p>
	But you're not me.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes it takes a while for your personality to mature and for you to really start to understand yourself before this test becomes meaningful. Especially if you're young.
</p>

<p>
	You can try other tests too. There's hundreds of them.
</p>

<p>
	You can also try to do the process backwards. Rather than taking a test, just read descriptions of all 16 personality types until you find which one resonates with you the most. I find this more accurate than answering silly ambiguous questions.
</p>

<title>Resources For INTP's</title>

<p>
	I found this online course specifically for INTPs & INTJs:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://personalityhacker.com/intx" rel="external nofollow">https://personalityhacker.com/intx</a>
</p>

<p>
	Can't speak to whether it's worth it or not, but seems promising.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Seems like us INTPs have a unique challenge with awakening & meditation because we love to use our minds so much. It's harder for us to shut down our minds because we are so creative and philosophical.
</p>

<p>
	Since many of us here are INTPs I thought it would be useful to start a collection of resources for this personality type.
</p>

<p>
	If there is high demand, we can do the same for some other popular types.

<p>
	It's amusing how shocked people are by Trump's behavior when it is classic stage Red stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Trump behaves that way. He's a stage Red con artist,Â the republicans fell for it and the adults in tbe room can't make sense of how anyone can be that way or fall for it.

People are capable of changing and outgrowing their past. The criminal already served his time. No need to punish him further after that unless you want him to stay a criminal -- which will come back to bite you.

<p>
	That would be an example of doing it irresponsibly.

<p>
	Not to mention that that comes off as desperate, needy, creepy, and dysfunctional. You would never send someone you hardly know sexual messages or pictures. That is analogous to whipping your dick out at a bar.

<p>
	Then there will be entire bot-nets hired to dislike and take down content.

<p>
	The YT algorithm actually counts dislikes as a boost to the video's popularity and visibility. Go take a look at the dislike ratio on a Justin Beiber video.

	It's okay to date people you meet from your job. You just have to do it carefully and responsibly. It is possible to abuse it, but not every instance is automatically abusive.

<p>
	The problem is that whoever polices Facebook will be doing it from some stage of the Spiral, which will piss off the rest of the Spiral below Yellow. It's a game that can't be won.
</p>

<p>
	3 billion people are not all gonna agree on howÂ to police Facebook. Each faction will feel it is being oppressed or biased against.

<p>
	Awakening on camera is a challenge because it reinforces a sense of other and gets one in one's head. It becomes a distraction from going deep within.
</p>

<p>
	At some point he's gonna have to realize that he is talking to himself and that there's no one here but him to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Best of luck to him. Not easy stuff. Hopefully he isn't doing it for the views and attention.

	Awakening comes in many degrees. He may have some mild, early version of it. Obviously he will need years to mature and this is his process.

<p>
	Sitting with the suffering, feeling it mindfully, rather than trying to escape it, avoid it, hide it, distract from it, or numb it out.
</p>

<p>
	And contemplating the root of your suffering.

	Why you putting such a negative frame on it?

<p>
	Even if everyone is hurt that doesn't mean anything bad. It presents even more of an opportunity for you to grow yourself into a loving conscious being and to help heal others by leading by example with your love.

<p>
	I like Scarborough because he has a nice character arc. He used to be very Blue and then Orange and now he's starting to see the light of Green, but he's still got plenty of Orange and Blue left.
</p>

<p>
	His development is a microcosm of American culture's arc. The pendulum is starting to swing Green but it's not fully Green yet and it doesn't fully understand what's going on at the meta level with all the various stages, so it gets self-righteous (as Joe does above) without realizing the true complexity of issues that Facebook and Zuckerberg face.
</p>

<p>
	Blaming Zuckerberg for Facebook is a cute move, but it's don't really grasp the depth of problems we face.
</p>

<p>
	But Joe is an example of an evolved and reasonable conservative.
</p>

<p>
	Anyhow... I love to see all this evolution happening! We live in rapidly evolving times!

<p>
	It is genuine FOR HIM. It's his way.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that the process of awakening, if actually filmed, will look very different -- much more messy and incoherent -- than some interview with Eckhart Tolle or Osho 30 years after the fact.
</p>

<p>
	Now that we have YouTube, more and more awakening processes will be filmed in real-time. And they will not look pretty or be grounded like some enlightened master sitting on a pedestal. It's gonna look a lot more "real". By which I mean, you're going to see the ego-mind acting out and airing its delusions. That is real. That's part of the process. Especially for young and immature people.

<p>
	It's foolish to compare cities and rural areas because they present very different governing challenges.
</p>

<p>
	Governing a giant, interconnected city like Chicago is much more challenging than governing some rural country town like Midland Texas. Giants cities are highly diverse culturally. Small towns are mono-cultures. Simplistic policies may work well in Midland Texas but they will not scale at all to a city like Chicago.
</p>

<p>
	Taking into account complexity, diversity, and scale is crucial. Of course these are notions far beyond the heads of most right-wingers.
</p>

<p>
	And if you want to play the blame game, liberal cities are far economically successful than small conservative country towns. Most of American's economic power and taxes come from big diverse complex liberal cities. It's no accident that all the biggest cities are liberal. They have to be in order to handle the diversity and not rip themselves apart. This one point shows that liberalism is a more evolved version of conservativism.
</p>

<p>
	If Midland Texas ever reaches the population size, diversity, and complexity of Chicago, it will become as liberal as Chicago.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "real" justice. There are various forms of it depending on your level of consciousness and development.
</p>

<p>
	Blue justice is very real and important. It is stern law and order type of justice. It's more masculine in flavor. A lot of the court and legal system is from stage Blue. Police. Military. etc.
</p>

<p>
	Green justice is more hippie and feminine in flavor. It's softer, more compassionate, less authoritarian, less punishing.
</p>

<p>
	Conservative justice vs liberal justice.

<p>
	Nope, sorry, you won't become a kangaroo.
</p>

<p>
	I was giving you a cute example to illustrate a larger abstract point. That doesn't mean you will turn a kangaroo.

If you actually ever do turn into a kangaroo that will be the most horrific experience of your life and it will leave you traumatized for months.
</p>

<p>
	Get serious about the consequences of what you're asking.
</p>

<p>
	If you could push a button right now and turn into a kangaroo, pushing that button would be scarier than putting a loaded gun in your mouth. This is not a game. This is not some cartoon where you turn into a kangaroo and it's all fun and games.

			I have a story on that topic.
		</p>

		<p>
			Last year I was training on a bike on one particular track, and I was like going extra hard coming back home. Saying:Â God, give me strength, the power to ride faster, I wantÂ more speed. I did it many times, always in the same place. And this year I went to ride this track once, but on my new e-bikeÂ that rides 50 km/h no problem, and I was like: "shit, my wish has been granted, just not in superhuman strength, but better equipment".

		<p>
			God works in mysterious ways.Â <img alt="xD" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/laugh.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/laugh@2x.png 2x" title="xD" width="20" />
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	When I was in full God-mode one time, I looked at a candle on my countertop and said, "Okay, let's make this thing levitate." And I tried to do the whole Jedi force levitate thing on it. Then I instantly realized, "Wait! Why am I being such an idiot?" and I just picked it up with my hand and smiled as I realize that this is how God levitates a candle. And I just laughed at how obvious it was.
</p>

<p>
	People are always looking for God in some miraculous event while overlooking the fact that EVERYTHING is a fucking miracle already.
</p>

<p>
	The way God magically eliminates hunger is by grilling a burger and then eating it. THAT is the miracle!

<title>Paradox: Infinite Love Vs The Cruelty of Survival</title>

</p>

<p>
	Of course selfishness is inherent to surviving as a finite self. That's the whole problem of existence! If you are attached to a finite form and to life, you must be selfish to succeed in that. And the reason you are selfish is because you love life and you love your ego-self.
</p>

<p>
	But this is not just some random shit that God threw into the soup for fun. The whole point of life is for selfish things to realize the joy and wonder of selflessness. Selflessness requires conscious realization. And for conscious realization of selflessness requires that you start out as selfish.
</p>

<p>
	Since reality is ultimately nondual, selfishness must equal selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way, if God could push a button right now and end all cruelty in the universe, would you happily agree to it? Yes? But that would mean that God would have to destroy all life, including you. Are you cool with that? See? So God is letting you hang around here and be cruel out of Love for you. Because you are too selfish to accept the end of cruelty. And God is too selfless to force you to be selfless. You must come to God at your own comfort level.
</p>

			Here's anÂ interesting theory about what Connor might be trying to pull off right now. So in his video below, Connor talks about (from 6:15 - 9:15)Â how Jesus was enlightened and basically faked his resurrection as an epic magic trickÂ to convince the masses into believingÂ that he was divine. Connor also draws a lot of parallels between himself and Jesus in another video titled 'The Truth' and referencesÂ Jesus' big magic trick again there. So the big questions is... is it reasonable to infer that Connor is following Jesus'sÂ playbook right now, as he described in his earlier videos? Maybe he's actually being fed through the window in his bathroom throughout the livestream fast. Connor clearly credits Jesus's resurrection stunt as being pivotal to the spread of Christianity, sees himself as Jesus, and has no qualms about lying if it results in more people awakening.Â So why wouldn't he do this? I could be completely wrong of course, but I think it's worth noting this because it almost seems as ifÂ Connor alluded to a master plan in his earlier videos.

<p>
	That can work, but there's a limit to how much you can bull your way through life.
</p>

<p>
	The key ingredient is CONSCIOUSNESS. The more consciously you do things, the more you will learn and grow from them.
</p>

<p>
	If you just mechanically put yourself into punishing situations that can backfire and it will certainly hit a glass ceiling.
</p>

<p>
	Pushing your comfort zone is important, but it must be done carefully, strategically, and not mechanically.
</p>

<p>
	Surrendering is an advanced teaching which most people are not able to understand or do. Usually it takes years or decades of struggle and growth to finally learn the wisdom and power of surrender. Some stage Orange macho alpha bro is not gonna appreciate surrender yet.

<p>
	YOU ARE GOD!
</p>

<p>
	God's consciousness is so high that it understands that whatever is happening is the best way it could be. Since God is Love, it can't help but love itself.
</p>

<p>
	The whole key here is for you to realize that no better reality is possible. The best reality possible has already been created. Here it is. The only problem is that you need infinite consciousness to appreciate it. Counter-intuitively, if rape didn't exist, that wouldn't be the best reality possible. It would be a worse reality. Any reality you imagine which is different than the current reality will be a worse reality. You just aren't intelligent enough to understand that because your vision is finite.

	Go vote for conscious leaders!
</p>

<p>
	That's how this works.
</p>

<p>
	People like to talk and whine but then fail to vote consciously.
</p>

<p>
	Hopefully these protests will get folks horny to vote.

			Beautiful analogy. Yes. And this explains "synchronicities" and so on.Â <br />
			<br />
			The Universe is One. It's all-knowing, all-intelligent, all-powerful, omniscient.Â <br />
			So naturally, the Universe can communicate with itself in many - infinite -Â ways, human minds simply cannot understand.<br />
			<br />
			For example, the Universe may know exactly what "Bob" needs to read on this forum in this very moment in order for him to progress towards his awakening. So he is shown <em>that</em> (as a comment by "Alice"). It seems coincidental, but nothing isÂ coincidental;Â everything is happening out of and because of: Intelligent Love = Your True Self = Me = God = Consciousness = Absolute Infinity.<br />
			<br />
			Ultimately, what is happening on this forum -- just as in the whole universe -- is one Self (God) talking and doing things to Itself ...Â <em>The Infinite Dance of The SelfÂ  ...Â </em>The Self has of course splitted Itself up into infinite many 'seemingly separate selves'... just for kicks... but they are ultimately all Absolute Oneness.

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	It's like playing an MMO game and realizing one day that you are not the player avatar but the entire server which generates all the avatars. The server is obviously one and contains all the seemingly-separate avatars.
</p>

<p>
	Just consider, every forum post and forum user on this website is obviously located on a single server which "knows" all the data more intimately than any one of us individual users can. In this sense the server is omniscient and all-powerful. The Universe as a whole works in a similar way.

<p>
	Expect mass protests in China a la Hong Kong and USA sometime in the next 10-20 years.
</p>

<p>
	As China viciously cracks down on them, the protests will grow stronger and gain more moral power.

<p>
	For me it works the opposite: the psychedelic integrates everything into a single unity, such that all the voices of humans I've ever heard are recognized to be projections of my own mind.
</p>

<p>
	It literally feels like my mind has imagined all humans as NPCs in my personal drama.

<p>
	Yes, I'm fully aware of the present material reality. I don't leave anywhere. I become more HERE than normal. But the HERE is recontexualized as God/Infinity/Love.

ItÂ became so terrifyingÂ that I needed all strength I hadÂ to stop it. But in retroperspective this could just have been a normal step/hurdle that everyone has to pass at some point smoking 5-meo. I do not want to believe that I went deeper than youÂ so if possibleÂ please tell me that this supernova thing is a regular awakening you alreadyÂ passed on yourÂ way to enlightenment and that there are much higher awakenings to achieve!

<p>
	I have no idea what level of consciousness you reached. Only you can know that.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe in this case you should lay off the 5-MeO and double-down on manual practices. 5-MeO can only take you so far.
</p>

<p>
	Endlessly hitting the pipe is not sustainable.
