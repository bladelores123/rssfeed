<p>
	It certainly helps, especially when starting out. If only as emotional support and accountability.
</p>

<p>
	Might as well have fun doing it. It tends to be more fun with wings.

<title>Leo, what do you mean by Cause and Effect is a total illusion?</title>

Yes, for survival (illusion) cause and effect is great.
</p>

<p>
	But at the level of Absolute Consciousness, cause & effect are a total illusion. This cannot be thought about. You must enter a totally nondual, Absolute state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Cause/effect = duality
</p>

<p>
	If reality is ONE, how can it be caused or be an effect? You must have two parts for cause & effect to be viable. So within duality there is cause & effect but within nonduality there is not.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to phrase it is: cause & effect is relative.
</p>

	He was a con man for most of his life. It's just that power corrupts and makes all personal defects 100x worse.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that Trump has manipulated his media image from the very beginning. His whole public image is a thin lie. He's neither successful, nor powerful, nor a good negotiator, nor a good businessman, etc. It's all bullshit spun by his ego.
</p>

<p>
	Also with age ego can get worse. The devil gets absorbed in his own devilry until he is too far gone. Alex Jones is a good example of this.
</p>

<p>
	I agree that Trump is serving his function for the greater ultimate good, in a twisted sort of way. We need someone to show up how ugly Orange can be.

			The US however, elected Donald Trump. There is a huge part of America, especially rural America that works their asses off for little money and they look down the road and see someone on welfare and the person on welfare is doing quite comparably well as they are. This causes intense hate for welfare and taxes. These people will cause riots before they submit to a socialist system, not understanding that it would benefit them more than just about anyone else. They look at the rich with worship, they dream to be that someday. They buy lottery tickets to entertain the fantasy.

		<p>
			The work that you teach, the work that we are doing is the only solution to this problem. Obama caused a lot of ego backlash. Obama caused Trump.
		</p>

		<p>
			Politics and tax reform needs to come after the hearts of the people have been changed. Giving much attention to politics is putting the cart before the horse right now.

<p>
	Be careful with such stereotypes.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that the majority of Americans voted against Trump! Technically Trump represents a minority of the country. Not only that, but most people voting for Trump were duped by his con game. The media did a really bad job informing voters of Trump's true nature prior to the election. Most people voting for him thought he was a successful business guy at stage Orange, when in fact he is closer to stage Red. America is not that regressive. Most Americans are conscious enough to see that Trump behaves like a devil. Even conservatives see this.
</p>

<p>
	Politics, government, and culture are always evolving. We are in a transition period from Orange to Green. It's going to be a bit rocky but we'll make it. Just because there is ego backlash doesn't mean we give up hope and stop evolving. The ego will always bitching and moaning. We don't let that deter us.
</p>

<p>
	The American political system is very corrupt and does not accurately represent the will of the people. Democracy is being undermined by money and ego. The majority of Americans are for policies like Medicare For All, Free College, ending wars, net neutrality, etc. It's just that corporate interests exert a corrupting influence on elections. In the future this will all change and money in politics will be outlawed.
</p>

<p>
	The hearts of the people are not so bad. It's the corporate influence which is heartless. This is a function of stage Orange materialism running amok. We will grow out it in time. 2020 might be a pivotal election cycle -- the beginning of the end for Orange domination. We'll see.

	It's not about handing out money. It's about correcting systemic inequalities. The system is rigged by wealthy and powerful egos. The ego never plays fair. The money is a compensating force against centuries of systemic rigging.

			One thing about psychedelics is they can take a mind-body into insanity zones. I’ve never wanted to eat or kill people while tripping, yet I’ve been to other insanity zones and that experience has given me a better understanding why people may want to do things that appear to be insane.

<p>
	Right, which shows you the connection between brain chemistry, mind state, and behavior.
</p>

<p>
	What psychedelics reveal is just how many different kinds of states of consciousness there are. Not just a dozen, but millions of radically different states. Various people can be in those various states depending on their brain chemistry, genetics, etc. Some people are stuck in an insane state and that is their reality.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is that some states are far more conducive to awakening and spiritual practice than other states. If your brain is in the right state, waking up is effortlessly easy. Other the other hand, if your brain in the wrong state, nothing you do will wake you up. State is absolutely critical for this work.

			Here, let’s say that there is a correlation between race and IQ. That does not mean genetics has anything to do with it. That is an assumption. The correlation could be spurious or there could be an underlying cause. Perhaps genetics, environment or a combination of both.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	If blacks in America received $30 trillion dollars in reparations for slavery (which is just one estimate of the damage done during slavery), the IQ gap would disappear. That's my empirical claim. It could be tested. But of course the whole point is that no one wants to test it. The whole point of the IQ race debate is to deny that blacks are economically abused. The ego wants to blame it on their "inferior genetics", rap music, drugs, sex, black culture, laziness, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The economic unfairness is deliberately overlooked. Because it's too true to admit! It's too much responsibility. What white ego wants to admit that blacks in America incurred $30 trillion dollars worth of abuse? It's too outrageous to admit.
</p>

<p>
	The amazing thing is that blacks have as high an IQ as they do, given the amount of abuse they incurred. A 10 point IQ difference is very small given the historical context and their economic situation.
</p>

<p>
	Hell, one easy way to remove the black IQ gap is to simply change the way we fund public schools. Make all our public schools evenly funded rather than basing the funding off local real estate taxes. This would equalize funding for school in regions with low real estate values. This one change alone could equalize the IQ gap. But no one wants to implement it because it means whites will lose their best schools.
</p>

<p>
	See, blaming genetics is very convenient because then it means we don't have to make any tough policy changes. The ego abuses a victim out of selfishness, then it blame the victim's genetics. This way the ego can feel righteous and superior while it keeps behaving like the selfish devil that it is. The whole purpose of the ego is to prevent honest self-reflection. The devil cannot look himself in the mirror, so he covers up all the mirrors.

<p>
	There is some truth to this.
</p>

<p>
	But it's important to teach stage Blue & Orange memes in a healthy, non-pathological, non-exclusionary way.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Jordan Peterson teaches these memes but he laces them with his toxic, judgmental, ethnocentric, dualistic shadow -- which then rubs off on his students.

<p>
	You must actually sit down and contemplate through these issues to understand how your mind works. Believing me is next to useless. Sit down with a journal and contemplate questions like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is reason?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is evidence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is data?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is interpretation?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is science?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is truth?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is knowledge?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do we know anything?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do I know I can trust my own mind?
	</li>
	<li>
		What if my mind is lying to me?
	</li>
	<li>
		How is my perspective biased?
	</li>
	<li>
		Where did my beliefs come from?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why do I believe the things I believe?
	</li>
	<li>
		If I don't know anything, how should I act?
	</li>
	<li>
		etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	See my video: How To Contemplate Using A Journal
</p>

<p>
	All the answers are inside you. But you have to sit down and dig them out.

<p>
	Yes, it definitely does. But I was sensitive to psychedelics even before 5-MeO. 5-MeO just took my sensitivity through the roof.

			No way lol. I don't know if that would be liberating or depressing, sounds like a weird combination of both.. This must mean that all forms of self consciousness are deluded and therefore causing massive amounts of unhappiness for no reason. People are trying to protect and enhance a self that doesn't even exist through the opinions of others who also don't exist.

<p>
	There is good reason for unhappiness and delusion though. It keeps you alive.
</p>

<p>
	If all delusion was removed tomorrow, society would collapse into anarchy and cannibalism.
</p>

<p>
	You can remove delusion within yourself, but doing it across all of society is unworkable at this point in human evolution. Society is like a house of cards held together with snot (delusion). If you insist too much on cleaning up all the snot, it will all fall apart. So the snot must be cleaned up very carefully and gradually to prevent catastrophic collapse.

<p>
	That only pushes the question back one step.
</p>

<p>
	The question is, why do most people not want to be?
</p>

<p>
	Want, after all, is not a free thing. Your wants are determined by your genetics, environment, and other factors outside your control.
</p>

<p>
	Why do some people want to eat people? Why do some people want to murder people?

<p>
	Every ideological bubble feels self-consistent and "reasonable". As long as you stay inside the bubble and don't go venturing outside.
</p>

<p>
	To create your own reality-bubble all you need to do is exclude, deny, and judge alternative perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	If you notice, Trump is a master at this. He's totally living in his own realty-bubble and you can see how he manipulates himself every day in order to exclude anything that would contradict his bubble. This is extremely dangerous when one has a lot of power.
</p>

<p>
	This is why we make a deep study of epistemology. So that we become self-aware of how our own mind constructs reality-bubbles.

<p>
	What must be deeply understood is that reason serves ego. Reason is NOT a function of truth or facts. Reason is designed to justify whatever serves the ego.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of the alt-right and these genetic IQ debates, a stage Blue/Orange ego is working backwards from its conclusion that European civilization must be superior. (Notice how convenient is it that these egos happen to be European! What a shocker <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> ) So they turn to "science" and "genetics" to solidify that fantasy in their own minds.
</p>

<p>
	That's what all this is really about. It has nothing to do with truth, facts, actual intelligence, or reality.
</p>

<p>
	What all of the alt-right boils down to is identity politics. They are trying to preserve their white male European identity in the face of a culture, society, era which is forcing us to adopt more global and inclusive identities. Their egos are scared of adopting a wider, more inclusive sense of self. That's all. The rest is just their justification games. "Science" and "reason" is used in these games because it lends an air of authority and truthfulness. After all, "How can one be wrong with science on one's side? Science is just objective facts, man! Facts don't care about your feelings. The data doesn't lie." LOL
</p>

<p>
	In reality there is no such thing as "data". There's ego cherry-picking & interpreting data to boost its survival.
</p>

<p>
	See, the devil always cloaks himself in a veneer of "truth".
</p>

<p>
	WinterNight is not boasting about it. He's very humble. Watch your projections.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with saying you are enlightened if you in fact are. All it means is that you are conscious of your true nature. That is not an egoic boast, unless you make it so.
</p>

<p>
	Of course plenty of folks on this forum claim to be enlightened when in fact they are not, or their enlightenment is very shallow. But some folks here are genuinely enlightened. Sometimes it's hard to sort the wheat from the chaff because communicating via forum doesn't give enough information in many cases. Although even via a forum, it's still quite clear who is spiritually mature and who isn't. You can tell just from the tone of their posts and their attitude. One of the hallmarks of a spiritually mature person is that he is unreactive and non-judgmental.

<p>
	Lol, she was on the brink of suicide and suffered for YEARS! You are dismissing all that "work".
</p>

<p>
	Yes, if you drive yourself nuts to the brink of suicide and then finally the ego happens to collapse by some fluke instead of you actually killing yourself, the brain can then rewire itself. But it wasn't really quick. It was a process years in the making. It's like an explosion that was building up for years, and then one day it all burst.
</p>

<p>
	And even so, these kinds of cases are extremely rare. They might as well not exist. This is not a reliable strategy for awakening.

			Plus, from (1), your points are true, but it’s just so rare to find relatives enlightened at the same time. 90% of those gifted teachers do not have enlightened relatives. Doesn’t that say something about the correlation between enlightened teachers having gifted genes.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You make an interesting point. But I still think there is a physiological component to spiritual giftedness. It's just damn rare.
</p>

<p>
	How do you explain that many of the most awakened people experienced their awakenings very early in life, often when they are 12 years old, 18 years old, etc. How do you explain people who do one meditation retreat or self-inquire for a few weeks and become enlightened? That is extremely rare and atypical. An average person cannot do that. Otherwise a large percentage of the population would be enlightened, but they just aren't and can't.
</p>

<p>
	More broadly-speaking, how do you explain that less than 0.00001% of humans wake up? This cannot be explained simply by lack of effort. Even within people who do hardcore spiritual practice, STILL, less than 1% deeply awaken. Again, this is not merely due to lack of effort.
</p>

<p>
	There is a deep connection between one's effort in this work and one's spiritual intuition. Why are some people much more spiritually attuned than others? Why are some people totally spiritually clueless? Lack of effort is not enough to explain it because one's willingness to exert effort is directly proportional to one's initial spiritual attunement.
</p>

<p>
	So my claim is that the people who wake up are the ones who start out in life already highly spiritually attuned. Poor upbringing and environment can obscure this attunement, requiring some decades of life experience for the person to realize that they even have this spiritual attunement.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with spiritual attunement is that most people who have it take it completely for granted. They don't know what life is like without it because they've always had it, and they assume everyone else has it too. But most people don't. It's sort of like having a very high IQ or being very tall. You don't even realize that most people are not that way.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I am 6'2". It took me 30 years to realize that not everyone is that tall. To me, being tall feels totally normal. I don't even know what it means to be short. It took me 30 years to realize that the world is designed for short people: hotel showers, all chairs and sofas and benches, airplane seats, sinks, toilets, urinals, jackets, pants, cars, etc. I can't sit comfortably on most chairs because they are designed for short people and I only realized that a few years ago! I didn't realize it because I assumed that all people are the same.

	But your shadow is that which you think you are not.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you think you are an honest person, your shadow is liars. What you must integrate are liars, by realizing you are them.

<p>
	It's hard to say.
</p>

<p>
	I think it's a combination of: genetics, my philosphical mind, years of contemplating deep philosophical matters, my relentless curiosity about nature, my relative lack of emotional obstacles, my good heart, my emotional maturity, self inquiry, and my past breakthroughs on 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation does not feel like it was an important factor for me with respect to tripping.

<p>
	Basically any of the practices I've ever talked about.
</p>

<p>
	Any kind of personal dev work or spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation is huge.
</p>

<p>
	And just master your life overall. Stop being a child.

</p>

<p>
	What Stefan is doing is devilry and ego. And he is misleading a great many people, building a cult.
</p>

<p>
	It's a total bastardization of philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	But he is too ignorant and too arrogant to understand this. He has trapped himself inside his own mind.

		</p>

		<p>
			1) If those sages were genetically gifted why aren’t their siblings and parents also spirituality gifted, after all they have the closest resembling genes. Sadhguru was the youngest of thirteen children, yet I hear none of his other siblings are gurus. His parents? Ramana had a brother, what about him? Was he also gifted spiritually?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, even siblings are genetically diverse.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, the genetic factor is still only one factor. Hard training is also required. Sadhguru did yoga from a very early age. Genetics alone is not enough in most cases. All that genetics do is make it easier, not easy.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, witchcraft seems to have some heritable aspects. Children of witches are more likely to have paranormal abilities from my understanding.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			2) Overall, talking about the link between the neural system and awakening leaves a huge problem. What about spontaneous awakening that happened in the past many times. Those took only a few moments, and yet left a permanent awakening experience and a radical new state of consciousness. How did the entire neural system rewire itself in only a matter of a few moments? Because the person often goes from an unconscious depressed, hugely egoic person to an enlightened master in a couple of minutes. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't see any contradiction here. The cases you're describing are extremely rare and they could be explained by the mind web going through a catastrophic collapse and then reconfiguring itself.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, all deep awakening is sudden. But also gradual.
</p>

<p>
	Virtually no one becomes a enlightened master in a couple of minutes. This is pure fantasy. Eckhart Tolle, after his egoic collapse, spent 2 years sitting on a park bench. That was 2 solid years of his brain integrating his breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	The opposite of what you say is true: all enlightened masters that I know spent 10,000+ hours to become a master. And that was on top of their spiritual giftedness!
</p>

<p>
	On top of all this there could additional factors like karma, soul, past-lives, etc. It's way more complex than people think.
</p>

<p>
	Stefan is mistaking genetics with terrible economic inequality and culture.
</p>

<p>
	The IQ difference between whites and blacks is not a genetic problem, it's a social, political, and economic problem. If blacks were not economically and culturally oppressed, their IQ scores would rise by at least as much as their IQ difference between whites and blacks.
</p>

<p>
	The IQ is a very poor measure. IQ tests are culturally biased and they do not accurately measure intelligence, nor is intelligence or IQ a fixed genetic trait like eye color.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot change your eye color but you can change your intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to provide blacks and everyone else in the country with free high quality education. Then human intelligence will shoot through the roof.
</p>

<p>
	It is ironic that people who cite the IQ test are themselves not exhibiting any great intelligence.

	African tribes give Iboga to teens. That's some hardcore drug. If a teen can handle Iboga he can handle anything.
</p>

<p>
	Of course some of them probably die.

<p>
	Spiritual growth is not for the cowardly. That said, don't be foolish about it either. I don't recommend psychedelics unless you have a mature mind.

<p>
	What matters is not your physical age but the maturity of your mind.

<p>
	Well, I told you guys very early on that I am going to change in big ways and that if you don't grow with me by doing the practices I will lose you in the dust.
</p>

<p>
	You have only seen 1% of my full potential and even less of your own.

<p>
	The paradox is that caring about other people can also become an obstacle. Women especially can develop an ego out of playing a "selfless" helper role.
</p>

<p>
	So you gotta strike a delicate balance.
</p>

<p>
	This whole process is a delicate balancing act. Too much to any one side results in pathology and getting stuck.

<p>
	Seems very likely.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it should be possible to take two brains/minds and merge them into one superbrain/supermind, resulting is some freaky stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a species in which every member's nervous system is interconnected with each other into a literal hive mind. That should produce some interesting new emergent stuff that cannot even be imagined.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute itself will never change. But the extent to which it understands itself, the extent to which is sees the interconnectedness of all form, should vary dramatically.
</p>

<p>
	The formless does not get more complex, but the form does. And since form and formless are one, to be totally omniscient will require a full integration of all form across all time. Which no human being can do no matter how enlightened they get.
</p>

<p>
	To put it another way, you do not fully understand what God is until you have experienced and integrated all form.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox of awakening is that it is Absolute, but it is not total. There are infinite degrees of totality because form extends forever. So you can keep realizing more and more of yourself forever without end. And that's exactly what evolution is doing.
</p>

<p>
	You are being far too flippant and one-dimensional. What you're exhibiting here is an absolutist pathology of awakening. A form of Zen devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Life is multiple-dimensional, infinite, and complex. There's way more to this work than you hold.

<p>
	What is silly is that you think you've reached some kind of end.

<p>
	Yes, and this is a complex and multi-dimensional thing. There is a LOT of subtle self-obsessed crap even after your first awakening.
</p>

<p>
	But also, realization is not just about becoming aware that you are nothing. It's also becoming aware that you are everything, and then realizing how God works through everything. So there are a lot of gems to be mined here.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org is a full-spectrum teaching. We are not merely interested in realizing nothingness here. We are interested in all dimensions of life and how they intersect with that Nothingness. That Nothingness turns out to be identical to every domain of life.
</p>

<p>
	How do you structure your life and society as a whole to align with your realization of Nothingness? How do you help elevate and awaken the whole world in an effective and non-pathological manner? These are the types of issues we're interested in here. We are interested in understanding what everything is and how everything interconnects. Which is a much broader scope than most spiritual teachings.
</p>

<p>
	I have taken a break from yoga and even meditation lately.
</p>

<p>
	My spirituality is becoming more organic and natural to the point where I am surrendering my rigid practices.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that the ultimate goal is for your entire life to become one seamless act of meditation, creativity, and love. You become God-like.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I still have a lot of work left. This is just a phase I'm going through, trying new stuff to see what works best.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, my mind is gradually becoming more and more quiet, making it easier to be in a semi-meditative state all the time, or at least especially when sitting down.

The question is - is this a sustainable way to become your highest self? 
			</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's true, we love shortcuts. Then again, not all shortcuts are automatically bad. The whole point of human society is to invent technological shortcuts for stuff that used to be impossible or really difficult. A car is a shortcut for walking to work. A farm is a shortcut for hunting migratory packs of animals. etc.
</p>

<p>
	Is it sustainable? I don't know. The research is still pending. What were are doing here with Actualized.org is on the cutting edge of human knowledge and technology. There is both risk and reward for being on the cutting edge. The discoveries we make, our children will take for granted as obvious. But right now it is not obvious.
</p>

<p>
	I would not recommend taking modafinil every day for months on end. Use it occasionally and stop if you feel like it's becoming a crutch. I don't use it much. Sometimes I just forget to take it for weeks at a time. I can function without it. But sometimes its a nice boost to my creative or meditative work.
</p>

<p>
	As of this writing I have not taken modafinil for over a month. Simply forgot it even existed. So to me it has no addictive quality at all. If I felt it had an addictive quality, I could probably not take it at all and I definitely would not recommend it publicly. My standard for recommending stuff publicly is that it must be non-addictive. For example, I do not recommend ketamine because it has some addictive qualities.
</p>

<p>
	I think modafinil can be very helpful to people who are new to this work. After years of meditation and so forth, you will probably outgrow it. Some people really struggle with ADHD, for example, and it's not just in their head. ADHD can cripple one's ability to self-actualize, which is a great shame. So it's nice if we have some tools for helping people to combat that.
</p>

<p>
	I don't think they change brain type.
</p>

<p>
	I think they can change how the brain is wired, which is very significant. Not sure about brain chemistry since there's no way I can measure that.
</p>

<p>
	Subjectively it feels like the last 13 5-MeO trips have significantly changed how my brain works in a permanent way. It's subtle, but also significant. I am not the same person I was a few months ago. But also, I'm not totally different either. It seems pretty clear to me that if I do another 50 trips, I will be permanently changed after that. My consciousness will be much more expanded at the very least. Perhaps even a more radical change could result. I suspect that at some point the brain/mind will totally collapse and reconfigure itself to function at a much higher level. Permanent superhuman levels seem within reach but I have not verified it yet. It's going to take a lot of tripping and serious integration work. And won't be easy.

</p>

<p>
	You can think of it as "lack of resistance" but that's just one facet of it, and it's still a concept you're holding.
</p>

<p>
	ACTUAL Love is something you must become conscious of. There is no way around that. It's like the color red. You cannot reduce it to anything else. You must actually look at red to know what it is.
</p>

<p>
	The reason my descriptions are not landing with you, or don't seem useful to you, is because you are not in the right state of consciousness. It's like I'm describing an orgasm to someone who's never had one. So it falls on deaf ears.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe try some mushrooms, LSD, or MDMA.
</p>

<p>
	Realizing Absolute Love is an epic, life-transforming experience. It's about as radical as getting abducted by an alien. You can't really believe it until it's happening to you, and then it's so real it cannot be denied or doubted.
</p>

	Epigenetics is real and valid. But it does not mean you can change it without limits. The limits are very tight, as they must be, to ensure you don't kill yourself.

		<p>
			It's said that after realization, you realize it was always already the case, so you we're enlightened at birth and after and now.

<p>
	This topic goes way beyond realization.
</p>

<p>
	And what I'm saying is that there is no such thing as one "realization". That's an abstraction. In fact, each realization is unique, with a unique depth, breadth, level of embodiment, and corresponding state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And none of this contradicts Oneness or the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that realization does not happen in isolation. It is always intermixed with mind and brain. With one's state of development, with one's body, with one's energetic system, etc. The realization is happening through a unique human body and mind. So no two realizations are identical even though the Absolute is one.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is always the case, but one's awareness and understanding of the Absolute varies a great deal. Case in point, a mule does not understand the Absolute even though the Absolute is there in the mule. A mule is not aware of God, even though it is God.
</p>

<p>
	We are not saying that a human cannot change or grow in certain ways. But there are hard limits on what you can change. And it's also a question of how much work is involved in changing. Maybe you could change yourself, but it will take a lot of work, whereas some people are already born that way.

	You cannot teach a mule arithmetic no matter how hard you try.
</p>

<p>
	To deny this leads to gross errors, unworkable solutions, frustration, and even evil.
</p>

<p>
	Acknowledging the uniqueness and individuality of each human is very important to build a well-functioning society. You cannot treat everyone as an abstraction. Some people have very different needs.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Why People Seem Crazy
</p>

<p>
	It's one of my most important videos if you want to understand humanity.

</p>

<p>
	If physiology was irrelevant, then there would be no difference between humans and chimpanzees. Our DNA is 99% the same, yet that 1% difference makes a HUGE difference in capabilities. These differences are not just between species, they are within each species as well. That's how evolution works. There is diversity. There is no such thing as "a human" or "a chimpanzee". Each one is unique. With unique strengths and weaknesses.
</p>

<p>
	It could not be otherwise.

<p>
	It is not victim mindset to say that a gorilla has more strength than a human. A gorilla could rip the arms out of man's sockets and a rattlesnake can see in infrared whereas you cannot. A woman can give birth, a man cannot.
</p>

<p>
	This is just acknowledging that an organism's capabilities are related to its physiology and genetics. It's a very obvious fact which many tend to overlook because they love the idea that all people are equal. Well, all people may deserve equal civil rights, but they are not equal in capability. Not even close. Some people cannot add two numbers together. Some people cannot read a book. Some people cannot see the color red. Some people cannot walk. Some people are covered in hair from head to toe. Some people hallucinate flying monkeys. Some people are psychopaths. Some people are witches. Some people have telepathic abilities. Some people have an amazing sense of smell, like a dog. Some people have perfect pitch. Some people have super-human visualization abilities, like Nikola Tesla.

			What I hear this guy describing in this interview is kinda what I hear from you with all your awakenings with 5-MeO but he’s having this just naturally. He’s describing literally <i><u>thousands</u></i> of deeper and deeper states of consciousness without any sort of external leverage like a guru, teacher, or psychedelic. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yup, this certainly happens.
</p>

<p>
	People generally do not appreciate how much difference there can be between brains. Some brains are able to access spiritual dimensions 1000x more efficiently than others.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that evolution naturally selects for human brains to favor survival and fitting into society rather than witchcraft. As we know, tens of thousands of witches and mystics (the most spiritually gifted humans) were demonized and executed. Witches are demonized in basically all cultures around the world.

			These cases like Sadhguru, Ramana Maharshi, even Ralston who describes his staggering amount of work (the talent aka inherent capacity still has to be there in order to be actualized)... I personally have a hard time finding relating to these people because it’s like relating to a human fantasy in most cases. It’s like being a good runner but comparing yourself to the world record holder in the marathon. I thinks it’s tricky because these people don’t seem extrodinary so it seems like “well yeah I should be able to do this then.” These people are not your average no-self level enlightened people.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Absolutely! Do not even try to compare yourself to the likes of Sadhguru, Ramana, or Ralston. That is a recipe for depression. That would be like comparing your lifting ability to a forklift.
</p>

<p>
	It is imperative that you walk your own unique spiritual path, not some guru's path. Your path must match your strengths and capacities.
</p>

			Nonetheless, I do find these cases who have these abilities absolutely fascinating because it’s shows what’s actually possible for a human being (whether it comes naturally or not) and sparks there curiosity for how dee human potential and understanding goes.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, appreciate freakish levels of excellence and consciousness in the same way you might appreciate freakish levels of musical skill or artistic skill. Don't expect everyone to be a Mozart, a Picasso, an Einstein, or a Da Vinci. These were gifted, genius people. They did not achieve it merely through hard work, although they did often work hard.
</p>

<p>
	At the same time, don't make victim-like excuses for why you cannot awaken. Don't think like this, "Oh well, I'm not as gifted as Sadhguru so I will never awaken." No! You can still awaken. It will just take more work.
</p>

<p>
	This also explains why psychedelics play such an important role. They allow people to access states of consciousness which the best gurus access naturally and effortlessly. The psychedelic levels the playing field. It's like taking a pill that would match your chess-playing abilities to Gary Kasporov. Then you can experience what it's like to play chess at a world-class level. You get to see what the guru sees. This allows you to understand the guru much better because now there is a set of common reference experiences between you two. And of course this motivates you to do the work because you see the amazing potential of the work which you would otherwise never see.
</p>

<p>
	LSD can definitely produce ego-death. At 125ug I get it basically every time.
</p>

<p>
	Every substance I've tried has produced ego-death for me at some point.
</p>

<p>
	Of course your results may vary.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is definitely the best for it. It's like pure ego-death in powdered form.

<p>
	Absolutely. In fact, I'd bet that the majority of enlightened people got there mostly due to their giftedness. It's just SO much easier that way. It's like being naturally high on psychedelics all the time.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to how the best weightlifters will be naturally selected for high testosterone. Those with naturally low testosterone simply won't be able to compete against them.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why many of the best gurus make the path sound easier than it actually is. It was easy for them. Yet it will be virtually impossible for ordinary folk.
</p>

<p>
	This is the kind of stuff gurus rarely admit. Because you cannot know this stuff from sitting on a meditation cushion. To know this requires broad psychological research which most gurus dismiss because it is not 1st person experience.
</p>

<p>
	Different brains have very different capabilities. It's not merely a matter of degree, it's also a different in kind. Some brains can access states and phenomena which other brains just cannot.

<p>
	This is not true, but at your level of consciousness and development it is true for you.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing about enlightenment work suggests you should not have relationships. If anything, your relationships will deepen. But at the same time you will not need them to be happy. So you'll get the best of both.
</p>

<p>
	What you're not realizing yet is that you ARE always alone, existentially speaking. Self/other is a conceptual distinction you are creating. All those "others" you think you're relating to are actually projections of your Self. No amount of relating will resolve your existential aloneness. That's something you must face head-on.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry, aloneness is not a problem. But if you feel like you need to connect with people, do so. What I'm talking about is more advanced than that. Many people here first just need to learn how to create relationships.

<p>
	Of course being more honest and authentic is a great spiritual practice.

<p>
	When you do 5-MeO properly, you will not need or want anything more.
</p>

<p>
	It is the pot of gold at the end of the psychedelic rainbow.

<p>
	No, it would actually make you more meditative and focused. Modafinil quiets the mind, but simultaneously makes it hyper-creative. Thoughts slow down but become more powerful and intuitive. Similar to a mild psychedelic.

<p>
	They are not at odds with one another. Those "crazy" spiritual experiences facilitate the ego's dissolution.
</p>

<p>
	Besides which, the ego's dissolution is not the only game in town.
</p>

<p>
	If you hold the "sober" state as more real than a "crazy" high state, that's an anchor point which needs deconstructing. The value of shifting states is that it helps to free oneself of states. But also keep in mind that whatever state you are in, that state is defining and limiting your understanding of reality. There are things you can understanding in a crazy high state which you cannot understand in a sober state. So to put a sober state as superior or more "natural" than a high state is incorrect. It's a bias. This is not to say one should get attached to high states either. The point is to be open to experiencing life from various kinds of states without demonizing them.
</p>

<p>
	People get trapped chasing states.
</p>

<p>
	But people also get trapped demonizing states and proclaiming that their state is the best and that other states are useless.

<p>
	That was said to contrast it with stage Green's mob/communal mentality.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Yellow is a more independent thinker.
</p>

<p>
	For example, stage Green might love the idea of living in a Hippie commune. Stage Yellow will not care much for that because stage Yellow has transcended that and would rather be more independent. Of course this is a gross-generalization. Nothing strictly prevents a stage Yellow person from being part of a commune for a while.

			My main point is that if you take a child and show irrational beliefs into them and never teach them to think rationally, then it's maltreatment.

<p>
	If you were skeptical and questioned yourself, you'd realize that you yourself are an irrational belief which was indoctrinated from an early age, and that "problems" are also a belief, are not real, but a fiction constructed by your mind.
</p>

<p>
	So you are like that kid believing in Santa Claus (problems) and we are telling you to let it go. Be skeptical of problems and question whether they are real. Question your judgment of religion and reality.

<p>
	Can you see how your judgment destroys true exploration, open-mindedness, and spirituality?
</p>

<p>
	How can you be truly spiritual when you hate religion?
</p>

<p>
	True spirituality is acceptance and love of whatever is.
</p>

<p>
	By hating on religion you block yourself from being able to explore it openmindedly.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire problem with religion is grounded in ego. See? And the whole point of spirituality is to become conscious of how your ego distorts reality. But you're overlooking all that because of your hatred for religion.
</p>

<p>
	You are falling into the trap of the lesser Jihad. Just like how Islamic terrorists do. So you have more in common with Islamic terrorists than with the Buddha. To become a Buddha you must drop all judgment.

<p>
	You are the placing this expectation on science.
</p>

<p>
	You are also placing an expectation on models that they must be 100% accurate.
</p>

<p>
	The issue isn't whether science will express Absolute Truth. The issue is, how does Absolute Truth/Infinite Intelligence work through science to generate scientific discoveries and models. A model is not supposed to be 100% accurate. That's not the issue. The issue is, how come you can understand anything about nature at all? Even with only 50% accuracy. That is still an amazing feat. And it's deeply connected to Infinite Intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Science is, after all, an expression of Absolute Truth. Constructions of the human mind are still God's handy-work.
</p>

<p>
	How is it possible that science can produce a chemical which induces enlightenment? (And it can). What more could you want from science?

</p>

<p>
	Children are indoctrinated in every culture at stages Orange and Green too.
</p>

<p>
	The core issue here is that you resist loving child abuse. You hate child abuse. That's understandable, but it is a deluded and false position. Since child abuse is a part of reality, you are just denying what is true.
</p>

<p>
	All judgments of reality are delusion. No exceptions. Your job is to love reality without exceptions. Notice how this threatens your ego. You refuse to do it. Because you are a devil.

		<p>
			So what is the unhealthy part of green that yellow transcends? It seems to me that if you don’t want to have relationships out of love it’s like stage orange. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Green has several limiting features which are important to transcend:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Mob mentality
	</li>
	<li>
		Over-emphasis of connection, feelings, and relationship to the exclusion of facts, higher realities, and results
	</li>
	<li>
		New Agey, air-fairy thinking; overly upotian and naive rather than realistic, grounded, pragmatic.
	</li>
	<li>
		Green arrogance (thinking that Green is the most evolved stage)
	</li>
	<li>
		Excessive relativism, to the point of denying the importance of hierarchies and higher values
	</li>
	<li>
		A naive sort of love and sense of justice/fairness which doesn't fully appreciate the complexity of government, life, war, politics, relationships, business, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Demonization of stage Orange
	</li>
	<li>
		Lots of judgment still
	</li>
	<li>
		Under-appreciation of the dangers of stage Red
	</li>
	<li>
		Shallow, flaky forms of spirituality
	</li>
	<li>
		Lack of awareness of and appreciation of the necessity of the entire Spiral
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Stage Yellow people have MORE capacity for love, not less. Their love is more grounded and realistic than the overly-idealistic love of Green.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Can you see how your hatred for religion is really just hatred of reality, and therefore hatred of yourself? Which is precisely what you don't like about religion. So you're hating on haters.
</p>

<p>
	Adding evil on top of evil does not create Good, it only compounds the evil.
</p>

<p>
	You have turned religion into your shadow.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to transcend this issue, apply love to religious people. Stop seeing them as separate from you. Stop judging them.
</p>

<p>
	It would be helpful if you studied religion more and developed a deep understanding of why religion exists.
</p>

<p>
	Let me reframe your question from a fundamentalist religious person's POV:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Christian: How long will it take until all Muslims are dead?
	</li>
	<li>
		Nazi Aryan: How long will it take until all Jew are dead?
	</li>
	<li>
		Muslim: How long will it take until all infidels are dead?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That is what you're doing.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than dreaming of destroying stuff, how about you learn to accept reality as it is?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The movement of your hand is not at all the same as understanding Einstein's General Relativity and being able to predict the existence of a black hole 100 years before it is photographed.
</p>

<p>
	You are underappreciating the degree of intelligence and understanding that goes into science. It is not so mechanical, and you cannot seperate it from truth in the way that you are trying to do.
</p>

<p>
	You are creating a duality between science and truth. There is a profound connection between metaphysics and epistemology.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is far more nuanced and profound, and no bit of forum explanation is going to do it justice.
</p>

<p>
	You take understanding for granted. Genuine understanding is possible. This is a very amazing thing!
</p>

<p>
	How is it that a dumb simplification can predict a black hole?
</p>

<p>
	All of this must be deeply contemplated, not replied to with dismissive answers.
</p>

<p>
	Without properly understanding this issue science and spirituality will not be integrated but fragmented from each other. In the future, mankind will integrate the two.
</p>

<p>
	What is the connection between science, truth, and understanding?
</p>

<p>
	You cannot just dismiss all science as delusion, since there is no fundamental division between science and spiritual inquiry. Spirituality is the science of spirit, you might say.

	There's a pretty massive difference between 10ug of LSD and 125ug of LSD.
</p>

<p>
	Or 0.5g of mushrooms and 4g of mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Or 15mg of 5-MeO and 30mg of 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	Doubling a psychedelic dose more than quadruples the effects.

He's interested in going as deep as possible and telling the truth like it is with no filter, weather people like it or not, similar to J. Krishnamurti. It's more so Spira, Tolle, Watts, Mooji, Sadhguru etc... that are to spread it wide as possible within peoples limited understanding, and thus heightening their level of awareness. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I try to go wide and teach to ordinary people. I don't see myself as the deepest. I see myself as a bridge-builder, helping people to interconnect various parts of reality. At least that's my role for now. It might change in the future.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Sadhguru does not give a fuck about helping you understand how science and spirituality interconnect. I do.
</p>

<p>
	What is the connection between Western science & spirituality? << That's a really good question to contemplate.

			Okay, I see. But in instances where god is speaking words to/at someone, surely they would realise that it was themselves if the experience where true?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, surely not. Duality is a tricky beast. In this case they are getting close to Truth but they still haven't realized that self/other is a duality which must collapse. Despite that, they can still glean some nugget of truth from that experience, like the sense of Divine Love. That sense of Divine Love might then inspire the person to be more selfless and to practice more yoga until finally they realize one day that self = other and that self = God. Then their realization will be complete.
</p>

<p>
	My point is, you should allow people a path towards the Absolute without cutting them down at intermediate stages. It's very demotivating and confusing for a spiritual seeker to realize something like Divine Love only to have a callous person tell them something like, "That's all ego delusion."
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if your child came home from 1st grade and showed you the A+ he got on his homework and you responded with, "So what? That's all horse shit. Where is your college diploma? Talk to me when you get your diploma."
</p>

<p>
	It's not realistic to expect everyone to become a Buddha without a lengthy spiritual path. We should allow people to walk their paths, being patient with them and helping them out without cutting them down.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	What I'm telling you is that the situation is more nuanced than that. Mystical experiences -- even if they are not full-blown enlightenment -- are not pure ego or delusion. They can be valuable, truthful, and healing. So don't be so quick to dismiss them.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is not 100% Absolute Truth does not mean it should be dismissed. Much of what we deal with in this work is various degrees of half-truths. That is okay. We shouldn't expect perfection from humans.
