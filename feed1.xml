<title>Vedanta Thread Shouldn't Have Been Locked</title>

<p>
	It wasn't a discussion of Vedanta, it was framed as a nonduality war and devolved into that.
</p>

<p>
	Threads which split hairs over unspeakable truths are not helpful, they just folks riled up and defensive as folks talk past one another.
</p>

<p>
	5 blind men and the elephant syndrome.
</p>

<p>
	It's literally a debate about nothing.
</p>

			But even if you become deeply enlightened, let's say like Ralston. Why can't you get access to do the creation aspect of God? Like materializing things through will, you think? Or you probably can, but do you think that is on the deepest levels of enlightenment? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, you DO get some access. You have some access to it even now. You've been using God's creative aspect your whole life. What do you think your mind is? Don't take your mind for granted. It is a powerful creative force.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, there are still limits because that's what it means to be human. You cannot just grow wings and fly off into the sunset. Because God has imagined a rule-bound world. That is what your current state of consciousness entails. If you were to radically change your state you could grow wings and fly away. Which you can do in your dreams, for example. But you tell yourself that that doesn't count. Well, that's your mistake right there. You are imagining that dreams and reality are two different things. They aren't. They are just different states of consciousness.

	Why is it that I have no problem with microscoops? The right dose every time.
</p>

<p>
	The volume of your substance is not going to change day to day. Just use totally flat scoops and it's very consistent.
</p>

<p>
	Scooping also reduces spills and waste.

<p>
	You could not stay alive long at such levels of consciousness. It is not practical because you do not care what happens to your body.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason humans have very limited levels of consciousness: it's not so practical otherwise. You could not accomplish work or raise a family and thus the species would go extinct.
</p>

<p>
	To live as a human is to be in a limited state. Human = limit. Unlimited is what you are when you stop being human.

	Yang is popular amoung young naive tech savvy stage Orange males.
</p>

<p>
	It's technophile pipedreams.
</p>

<p>
	It would be like if Elon Musk ran for president. His fanboys would be all over it, but they would not understand that Musk is not so advanced politically.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse tech stuff with serious reform of society.
</p>

<p>
	The Yang Gang is not stage Yellow, it's Orange. So watch out.
</p>

<p>
	Yang pushes all the right buttons of tech savvy stage Orange males. Notice that. That's why they like him so much. It's an unconscious response, not careful critical thinking.

<p>
	You're not getting it.
</p>

<p>
	MONEY is the hierarchy!
</p>

<p>
	Money means nothing without a hierarchy of wage slaves who will work for you to get your money.
</p>

<p>
	There is no escaping society other than through death.
</p>

<p>
	You can live alone in the woods but you will still be intimately tied into society regardless of how much money you have.
</p>

<p>
	If you watch Life Below Zero you see just how badly people who live alone in the remote Alaskan wilderness depend on society to save their ass. They could not live otherwise.

</p>

<p>
	You can't have it both ways: you can't stay yourself and radically change. It's one or the other. Being you means not being something else. And you are deeply committed to being you. You are not just a blank slate. Your biology has certain trade-offs. You can't just turn yourself into a kangaroo because then you would no longer be a human. By being born as a human you already made the choice to not be a kangaroo. That's what human birth is! That choice! So now you're stuck with it until you completely relinquish that choice (via "death").

You could hallucinate a person, have a conversation with him for 2 hours, only later to realize that he was just your own imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Datura is lethal so don't ever try it. But it's important to understand that such things are possible because physical reality is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	If you've taken high doses of psychedelics you have first hand experience of how your imagination can become reality.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't happen in conventional states of consciousness because it interferes with your survival.

<p>
	Stop assuming that the drug regulators are looking out for you. They looking out for their wallets and egos.

<p>
	Of course microscoop measurements are all relative per substance.
</p>

<p>
	What you do is start with a 1 scoop dose. See how that feels for you, then bump it up to 1.5 or 2 scoops next time.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this has to be done each time anew for each new substance.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are familiar with your substance, counting in terms of scoops rather than milligrams becomes easy and accurate.
</p>

<p>
	There are few substances that I have heard of where one 10mg microscoop will be way too much. Especially if you're plugging it.
</p>

<p>
	I have found milligram scales to be not sensitive enough. I can throw 10mg on the scale, then double that dose and it will still say 10mgs!
</p>

<p>
	A $1 dollar microscoop is easier and dare I say even more accurate.
</p>

<p>
	Scales are so overrated. Mircoscoops are the way to go when dosing tiny amounts.

</p>

<p>
	What I say does not contradict what you say.
</p>

<p>
	God is all form, and if all form disappears, God is the emptiness that remains. There is only one thing: God. It can take many forms or no form at all, and there is no difference between form and not-form unless you hold that there is.
</p>

<p>
	Way too much hairsplitting going on in this thread. It's a discussion about nothing.

<p>
	You are taking your life for granted. Not seeing all the love around you.
</p>

<p>
	Who is responsible for that but you? Who else can see the love for you but you?

<p>
	It's like you've lost your glasses and looking for them in anger while not realizing that they are on your face and you are looking through them right now!

	Locking this because it is dangerous and sets a bad example for others.
</p>

<p>
	This is egotiatical and not what Actualized.org is about.
</p>

<p>
	You can do whatever you want on your own but please don't give our work here a bad name, as this ruins psychedelics for others. We want to demonstrate responsible and safe use of psychedelics.

EVERYTHING is Brahman. Your nonduality is incomplete.
</p>

<p>
	If you have 2 things, that is duality!
</p>

<p>
	The distinction between Brahman and world is something Brahman (You) is imagining.
</p>

<p>
	All difference is God's imagination at work. So if you see a difference between things, you can be sure that you created that difference.
</p>

<p>
	It would be wise of you guys to listen to what is being said here.

	This will not fly at all.
</p>

<p>
	You need TOTAL superhuman focus to breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	You have not even begun the work yet. You are kidding yourself still.
</p>

<p>
	You can keep doing passive inquiry for 1000 years and not awaken. So be very realistic with yourself about how you are wasting your time. You have to be brutally honest with yourself about distrations.
</p>

<p>
	Make a clear distinct between when you are seriously inquiring vs just screwing around.

	We don't practice the occult here.

<p>
	Your real work should be to move on from Chris, let him be, and do consciousness work on yourself until you realize that death is an illusion.

<p>
	Communicating with the dead is not going to resolve your fundamental life issues. This takes some wisdom to see.

In the end you should be much more functional by being conscious.
</p>

<p>
	Of course shutting off the mind disrupts a lot of egoic survival schemes, goals, motivations, and manipulations.
</p>

<p>
	You're not realizing yet that the goal of spirituality is surrender of all reality and practicality. You cannot be liberated so long as you're worried about being practical.
</p>

<p>
	After awakening you can pick some of that practicality back up, but while you are working towards awakening the point is to surrender more and more of it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this interferes with becoming successful. But the point is that success is a never-ending cycle of suffering.
</p>

<p>
	But there's also nothing wrong with working on success if you feel you need to. Remember, plan out your life in chapters and phases. If you're young you might want to spend 5 or 10 years working on success before you go heavy into awakening work.
</p>

<p>
	So get clear about what you want and then pursue that decisively.

</p>

<p>
	That line of reasoning is precisely how the ego maintains itself. You must challenge that if you wish to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	The selfish one is you. You are so selfish you cannot even see your own reasoning as devilry.

<p>
	Only because you have barely started the process of awakening. It goes far beyond anything you can imagine. All of reality will collapse if you go deep enough. But you are too scared to go that deep. You are not willing to surrender your whole life yet.

</p>

<p>
	You have imagined absolutely everything about your life, including your birth, your parents, your memories, the Earth, the solar system, the 21st century, animals, trees, emotions, thoughts, science, fiction, your death, the past, the future, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And you are imagining right this moment that you are not imagining all of that but that it is "real".
</p>

<p>
	So you're manufacturing all of reality while being in denial about it.
</p>

<p>
	If you weren't doing this, you could not exist and there would be no world or other people. So you cannot stop doing it, lest you die.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is you were never born. You merely imagine you were.
</p>

<p>
	Understanding all of this would give you something akin to a psychotic breakdown. But it is called awakening. When you are fully awake, you can hardly understand how you ever believed you were born. Since birth is just imagination.
</p>

<p>
	You are God.

<p>
	Problems only occur within the relative domain, as a function of survival. They are important to solve, but only from the relative domain. From the Absolute nothing needs solving.
</p>

<p>
	The most powerful way of solving a problem is by realizing it's not even a problem.

<p>
	No, during the peak of the trip all these crazy synchronicities were noticed. I would describe it as miraculous.
</p>

<p>
	But only inside the trip. Outside the trip life appears ordinary.

<p>
	I have taken it on 3 consequential days and saw no tolerance.
</p>

<p>
	I'm assuming it works like DMT or 5-MeO-DMT, which have no tolerance. Which means you could take it multiple times per day. But I have not tired that. I strongly suspect it would work.
</p>

<p>
	It is not like mushrooms or LSD.

<p>
	What do you mean by debilitating?
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to say. You could try a small doses and get a feel for the vibrations to see if you are okay with them. For me it's no problem.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all psychedelics can be carefully tasted at very low doses. So there doesn't have to be any risk. You are the one who's in control of the risk. A wise person would always start with a threshold dose of a new substance, thus eliminating all potential risk. Even your grandma could handle a threshold dose of any substance.

<p>
	People mostly run into problems only when they dose too high too soon.

<p>
	Do not confuse absolute and relative matters.
</p>

<p>
	The context of this thread is a relative one about human societies, religion, etc. Within such a context, social science and developmental psychology (like Spiral Dynamics) is applicable and useful.
</p>

<p>
	The materialistic paradigm is a totally different context. The context there is the ultimate nature of reality, in which case it is incorrect. But the materialistic paradigm is great if you want to land a rover on Mars.
</p>

<p>
	Science isn't all wrong. It's just limited to certain contexts and it cannot address the ultimate metaphysical questions.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there is good science and bad science. Science which contradicts nonduality is bad science. Although even it can be useful in certain narrow situations like building a new iPhone.
</p>

<p>
	Who decide which science is good and which is bad? You do, of course! You are the ultimate arbiter of truth. Since you are God and you are imagining this whole game. Whatever you say is true and good will be true and good from your POV.

<p>
	I don't think so because what it means to be human is to be limited in specific ways. Humans are a very crude species. We are extremely limited compared to other possible beings.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, humans and ants are ultimately one. But that does not mean an ant can do calculus. From an ant's POV a human being can perform miracles.

<p>
	Your son, your letter, the universe, your life, and your death are all being imagined in the mind of God.

<p>
	Consciousness does not leave the body. The body is an imagination of infinite consciousness. Consciousness is what you really are, and it cannot go anywhere because it imagines all possible locations.

But in case he actually could do these things, then he probably did it similarly to how you described how imagination works. You said that - in an even deeper state of consciousness - you could probably turn your hand (with your imagination) into tentacles. That would be how Jesus turned water into wine. Then Jesus must have been incredibly deeply enlightened when this was his baseline consciousness. (except the ability to do these things doesn't necessarily require such a deep enlightenment but can also be attained for example through a kundalini awakening as a siddhi)
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that would be how.
</p>

<p>
	Extraordinary healing is definitely possible from everything I understand.
</p>

<p>
	There's an interesting possibility which people overlook about Jesus. Jesus may not have been a human being. So trying to replicate his results may simply be impossible for humans.

		</p>

		<p>
			If you become the Godhead and you start imagining healing yourself, can you actually see the changes happening or is it only a feeling? Maybe more radical than that would be a situation where a person is sitting next to you and sees your hand turn into a tentacle - do you think that's possible?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The person sitting next to you will cease to be person long before your hand turns into a tentacle.
</p>

<p>
	If you do large enough doses you could probably experience your hand as a tentacle, but then it will shift back. Like it could in a dream. Stop thinking of your dreams as unreal. They are as real as the physical world. So all that crazy stuff you are able to do in your dreams is God imagining new realities.

</blockquote>

<p>
	God is all there ever is. Everything is God at all times, but you are not aware of this fact because you are so busy imagining being human.
</p>

<p>
	To be human is to imagine you are human. This conflicts with being the Godhead. It's hard to be both at once. Your whole life is just God experiencing humanness. God is relentless about it. Becoming conscious of God does not help your survival, and you are so wrapped up in survival that you cannot help yourself. You do not know how to stop and you are scared to death of God. So you actively avoid God, Truth, and Love. Because it's too good for your human mind to handle.

			This seems to be a chicken and egg issue you've skirted over. Materialists are close minded because they haven't directly experienced the absolute, but those who have experienced the absolute and draw different conclusions are close minded because they are in the materialist paradigm. So what makes your direct experience worth more than the next's? Are your experiences not just as colored as theirs are?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is a big difference between nonduality and all models/theories about reality. They are not even in the same ballpark. It's not about drawing conclusions. Nonduality is Absolutely Absolute. It is not a function of a mind explaining things. Explanation itself becomes impossible at such levels.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who tries to advance a theory or model of reality is immediately wrong. It's obvious they do not understand that reality is Infinity and cannot be modeled in any way. They are not conscious of what God is. They are not conscious of how they are imagining all of reality, including all of their models.
</p>

<p>
	Those who have experienced the Absolute draw very similar conclusions to me.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful assuming that just because someone smoked some DMT and spoke to some aliens that they have experienced the Absolute. There are also many degrees of depth to the Absolute. Some people have only experienced the Absolute in a shallow way, without understanding its full ramifications for their worldview. It's not merely enough to take psychedelics, one has to deeply contemplate the right questions. Most DMT users are not contemplating anything because their trips are 5 minutes of utter chaos. For example, Joe Rogan talks about DMT a lot, but he does not understand the Absolute. Nor would I expect him to because he's not seriously investigating the substrate of reality. DMT is not a good substance for deep understanding because it's too fast acting.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality has a lot of detours, astral realms, and other weird things to it. But Absolute Consciousness trumps them all. It is the ultimate source of all possible realities. It is the Groundless Ground. It is God. It is infinity. You are God, you are infinity.

<p>
	Sounds right. 40mg of 5-MeO is a crazy dose.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, you can take many psychedelics at crazy high doses and experience crazy and impossible things. You just gotta be very careful. I deliberately do not take high doses. I take as much as I feel I can handle at the moment. This gradually grows me and allows me to handle more and more radical things. I proceed very cautiously. Where most people using psychedelics are like the rabbit, I am like the tortoise. I expect to discover many new things yet.

	Once you master plugging you'll never snort anything again. Plugging is silky smooth and painless. Snorting stuff is more harsh and the nasal drip distracts from the show.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I cannot speak for you.
</p>

<p>
	For me, it's similar to 5-MeO-DMT in that it creates a state of total nondual consciousness, but then I'm also able to use my mind to contemplate whatever interests me and guide the trip in that direction. It's got a vibratory body energy more so than 5-MeO and it's more visual like a low dose of mushrooms. At higher doses the visuals will become more serious. I did not get serious visuals at 50mg.
</p>

<p>
	It lasts almost exactly twice as long. Which is awesome for contemplating. 5-MeO never quite lasts long enough for me.
</p>

<p>
	For me 2C-B has a terrible heavy body load. I don't enjoy that. LSD also tends to make my body feel uncomfortably alien. I enjoy the body feel of DPT more. 5-MeO-DMT probably has the least body feel of them all for me, which is nice.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to definitely say that DPT is better than 5-MeO-DMT. I love them both. Both have something unique to offer. Both deserve to be at the top.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't know what parallel realities means. To me there is only one reality and one consciousness which imagines everything else.
</p>

<p>
	At moderate doses I could control it pretty well in a non-egotistical way. I could use my intention to guide me. That was nice. I could for example use my intention to heal myself or to contemplate a topic I was interested in.
</p>

<p>
	At higher doses I'd imagine you'd lose control and it would turn into insanity.
</p>

<p>
	I find that mushrooms can produces some delusional thoughts. But DPT is not like that for me. DPT is very true in my experience. When you are in the Absolute it is totally self-validating. It cannot have any external frames of reference. You just magically know that it's absolutely true. It is an understanding beyond ordinary human thoughts. It's like the understanding of God himself.

<p>
	I suspect that my DPT trips may be strongly influenced by prior 5-MeO-DMT breakthroughs. So basically all I get is pure nondual consciousness, not some occult hellscape.

<p>
	Interesting note: Stan Grof did testing of DPT for treatment of alcoholics back in the 50's and 60's. I can definitely see it working for addiction recovery and treatment of depression.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, if an anxious or depressed person takes DPT, they might be in for some hell as their negative mind might become realized.

	I have not tried it on account of its dangers.

<p>
	I assume it has some value. But from what I hear its too wild, chaotic, and nonsensical for our purposes.

	I can verify that musical enhancement is pretty awesome on this substance.

<p>
	And it also seems to trigger crazy synchronicities. It's almost spooky how magical those can be. And I'm not a big synchronicity guy.

	I have not experienced any darkness from it. Just pure God & Love.

	Interesting how that is. It seems to affect people very differently. It really unlocks the power of one's imagination, so whatever darkness exists in you may become manifest.

			Also there is a church in Manhattan called The Church of True Inner Light that use DPT as their main sacrament. I remember getting their info-pdf. Pretty weird stuff. They basically believe in a Christian doctrine and that DPT is"weird and scary" until you go in with the belief that Christianity is right then it reveils Christian themed visuals and atmosphere. So it seems it can be deceptive to people that are naive, imo. Even more than your average psych

	Yeah, I read about it. Seems like a wacky cult-like organization. But they sure did pick a great chemical to start a religion around <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	DPT will completely unlock one's imagination, so whatever religious imagery one believes in will become manifest. Or if you believe in pure nonduality, that will become manifest.
</p>

<p>
	On DPT I was actually able to integrate and understand all of the world's religious imagery simultaneously. It was an awesome degree of total integration which cannot be accomplished via ordinary thought. It was like a multi-dimensional integration and simultaneous understanding of all symbolic systems ever invented by mankind. All human symbolic understanding is relative and arbitrary. Yet all of it can also be meaningful to the one holding it.

<p>
	Just be ware that many of those negative trip reports can be very misleading. For me the experience is purely positive and pleasant.
</p>

<p>
	Dosages on PsychonautWiki seem to be pretty accurate. Rectal doses are similar to smoked dosages! Making it very potent.
</p>

<p>
	For me, rectal doses go like this:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Light: 20mg-30mg
	</li>
	<li>
		Medium: 30mg-40mg
	</li>
	<li>
		Heavy: 50mg+
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	But I'm pretty sensitive to all psychedelics, so you may need to dose higher.
</p>

<p>
	Your starting dose should be no higher than 20mg to get a feel for the body load and vibrations.
</p>

<p>
	With rectal administration the trip will start within 15 minutes, hit strong by 25 minutes, and last strongly until 2h30m. After effects tend to linger for quite a long time, at least a few more hours but you'll be out of the breakthrough zone by 2h30m.
</p>

<p>
	Be very cautious with anything above 50mg. It will melt your reality.
</p>

<p>
	DPT does not seem to come in any other form but HCl. The freebase version of DPT is oily and not suitable for storage from what I hear.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, and DPT HCl refuses to dissolve in water at all. You can still make a suspension, but the actual DPT particles will not dissolve. This isn't a problem per se. It absorbs into the body just the same. But emptying the oral syringe is a bit trickier because sometimes the particles tend to stay in the back of the syringe requiring a bit more effort to deliver the full dose.

And suffer through the hell of not getting what you want.
</p>

<p>
	There is no shortcut here. You're gonna have to suffer until that ego finally gives up and dies. The ego will not just give up its most important desires without massive struggle.
</p>

<p>
	To achieve this you're basically talking about giving up your entire life. It's harder than suicide. Which is why virtually no body does it.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is the very thing you've been avoiding your whole life: death.

<p>
	Salvia is not scheduled in the US. They sell salvia at local smoke shops in Vegas. You can buy it legally. At least you used to be able to. Not sure about how it is now in 2019.

<p>
	It's so backwards too, because salvia truly deserves to be regulated. It's a dangerous substance.

Reality is not a simulation, it is not digital, it is not some hyper-space DMT realm, and it is not occurring inside any brain.
</p>

<p>
	All of that is a subset of Infinite Consciousness. So watch out for people who smoke too much DMT. Their understanding is not ultimate no matter how many aliens they encounter or talk to.
</p>

<p>
	The author is still subtly attached to materialism and scientific modeling. Which is why he cannot understand the ultimate nondual level.

<p>
	Yes, but I am allowed to have my opinions and analysis of it.
</p>

<p>
	In fact I stated that I am adding onto the original model.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that they took this model from Clare Graves, then trademarked it.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if someone trademarked Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. And then blocked anyone from teaching it unless it was taught precisely as they wanted.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of science is to share models, innovate upon them, and point out their limitations.

</p>

<p>
	I was not even notified that the video was deleted.

<p>
	My guess is that one of the Spiral Dynamics founders filed the trademark complaint to take it down.
</p>

<p>
	He might do the same for all of my Spiral Dynamics videos. And YouTube gives me no mechanism for disputing it. They just delete the entire video without warning! It's absurd.
</p>

<p>
	It's BS because trademarks appear in video titles all the time. How many videos use trademark names like Star Wars, Disney, etc? Millions of them. That is fair use.
</p>

<p>
	I said eyes open!
</p>

<p>
	Open your eyes when you read <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Look, I'm just giving you my way. Your way may not be my way. Do whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	The fact that you consider the world of form "a dualistic distraction" is precisely why I'm telling you to keep your eyes open. So your visual field can be recontextualized into Nothing.
