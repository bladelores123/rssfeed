			if a child suffers horrific life long abuse by a parent and then later as an adult still has a strong reaction of pain to what happened, and even at times resents the parent, what is it that is also in the child?

<p>
	This is shadow work 101.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the child's mistake (now that's he's an adult) is to disown the fact that being abusive is not just a thing "others" do, but that he is also capable of it. By realizing that being abusive is also a part of him, he can integrate it and heal. Otherwise he will forever be resentful because he feels that abuse should not have happened to him because he would never do such a thing himself. But the truth is that he would do such a thing himself if he was placed in that situation.
</p>

<p>
	At an even deeper level he can become conscious that all the abuse that exists in the Universe is literally his own self.
</p>

<p>
	With deep enough consciousness you will realize that whoever abused you, was actually your own self! So you abused yourself. And when you realize that, you can forgive yourself, accept yourself, and heal.
</p>

<p>
	Try to fathom this: you literally ARE every rapist in the world who has ever lived. Rape is not something some "other" "bad guys" do. Rape itself is construction of your own Universal Mind. When you realize this, you stop disowning rape, and you accept yourself as a rapist (even if your human body has never raped anyone). It doesn't matter what your human avatar did or didn't do. Once you realize you are the whole Universe, anything that occurs in the Universe is part of you. Since your true identity is Infinity, that means you are a rapist.
</p>

<p>
	If you are God, and God is Everything, then God is rape, and you are rape.
</p>

<p>
	A bitter pill to swallow <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	But should you swallow it, you will become Whole.
</p>

<p>
	What parts of yourself are you disowning? Hint: everything that you consider "not-me".
</p>

	The simple fact is that mankind will not take climate issues seriously until they feel the burn of it personally. So we wait for that to happen. Suffering is the greatest teacher.

<p>
	If you want to do a critique of my work, go ahead. But actually do it. Don't do this pathetic "he's a cult leader" stuff. Actually state which of the things I say are false and why. The way you say "cult" shows that you don't even know what a cult is or how cult leaders operate. Maybe actually read some books about it on my book list, or watch my Cult Psychology videos.
</p>

<p>
	If I am so wrong, then the things I say should be very easy for you to deconstruct. If you were serious about truth-seeking you would not be here using ad hominem smears.
</p>

<p>
	This work has nothing to do with me. It does not hinge on me personally nor should anything I say be taken as a belief -- which I have repeatedly told you guys from day 1. If you cannot personally verify something I say, then it is not true.

<p>
	The point is that the world and life and society are not coming to any end. Not even close. A lot of Green folks portray climate change as if that were the case. Which is a frame that is both false and makes people depressed.
</p>

<p>
	Will some animals and humans get hurt in the process due to climate change. Absolutely. And that has always been the case with human evolution. How many buffalo were hurt in the conquest of America? How many natives?

	Conservatives are on the losing side of history most of the timeÂ so they have to make desperate moves to cling to the past.

<p>
	Sure, but there are millions of species, and new ecosystems will form, and even new species will arise.
</p>

<p>
	Again, it's all a matter of perspective.
</p>

<p>
	Ecosystems can be rebuilt. Species can even be reverse engineered.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, 99% of species eventually die out. The whole Earth is evolving and manmade climate change is plan of that evolution. Mankind is not some "unnatural" force.

<p>
	It's not a matter of me showing you some research paper. It's a matter of you using some big picture thinking.

<p>
	A 2 degree rise in climate is not the end of anything. The EarthÂ has been much hotterÂ than that before and life goes on.
</p>

<p>
	Environmental people are too close to the problem to see it in the grand scheme of things. They are stuck in a sort of mid-term thinking which leads to depression. You gotta take longer view. In the long view mankind will terraform the Earth to the perfect temperature.
</p>

<p>
	Listening to scientists without doing your own big picture thinking about their data is the trap here. Scientists are not big picture thinkers. They just robotically spew out data without any consideration of mankind's evolution.
</p>

<p>
	This is not to say we should not take action of climate change and polution. We should. And we are. But it's gonna take time, so be patient. You can't turn an oil tanker on a dime.

<p>
	If your worldview leads you to fear and depression, then obviously something is wrong with your worldview -- NOT with the world!
</p>

<p>
	The point of this work is to cut through the BS that is fear and depression. If this work is not making your happier, lighter, and more playful , you need to change your understanding of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Being fearful, frustrated, and sad is not a conscious or truthful state and it is not how we heal the world.

<p>
	Ego is a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Ego sits much deeper than thoughts, beliefs, or feelings. Which is why the ego doesn't go away simply if you stop thinking for a while.

<p>
	There are dozens of possible causes so there cannot be one solution. You must track down your root cause.
</p>

<p>
	For me, diet plays a big role. Some foods make it much worse, others much better.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely get an in-depth check up of your thyroid. It's a big factor.

<p>
	This is false. Fiber must be avoided at all costs as it feeds the SIBO, and SIBO inflames the gut, making it more leaky.

			Do you think itâs best to just go with the diet I feel best on? For my case it would be keto, but with people saying itâs a disaster long term, Iâm lost. Like do I go on a non-keto diet that I feel worse on relative to a keto diet, just toÂ <em>hopefullyÂ </em>save my long term health?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Just because it feels good doesn't make it healthy long-term.
</p>

<p>
	Do keto for now, fix your issues, then you can expand to healthier diets. You gotta find which plant foods you're sensitive too and avoid those while eating the good stuff you're not sensitive to.

<p>
	That's right, you shouldn't just trust such books. You must test against your own direct experience.

<p>
	You could try meat + low sugar veggies like leafy greens and maybe some low sugar fruits like berries.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a gut bacteria problem, sugary fruits and veggies will certainly make it worse. After you fix the gut bacteria, then you can go for a more veggie/fruit diet. But until then I would avoid them.
</p>

<p>
	If you have SIBO nearly any fruit or veggie will do more harm than good.
</p>

<p>
	Liver Rescue assumes you don't have SIBO or leaky gut. But it sounds like you do.

<p>
	Life coaching is usually not suitable for people under 25 because the ROI isn't there and they aren't mature enough to male use of it. It only makes sense to coach people who have good incomes and are serious about optimizing their results.
</p>

<p>
	You might consider tutoring as a way to make ends meet. You can tutor high school and college kids. The is much more practical.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that people usually only pay for practical things. It's very challenging to market impractical stuff with low ROI.

<p>
	Usually any sugar is consideredÂ breaking the fast. Small amounts of fat are more tolerated since you can still stay in ketosis.
</p>

<p>
	You'll want to research specifically about how diabetics handle fasting. Not sure.

<title>Should you Avoid MultiVitamins When Fasting?</title>

<p>
	You should not because:
</p>

<p>
	A) The whole point of a fast is to rest your digestive system as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	B) Vitamins taken on an empty stomach can lead to some nasty nausea.
</p>

<p>
	You can survive just fine a few weeks without vitamins.

<p>
	There are many degrees of quality to psychology. It can be done poorly, it can be done exceptionally.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that you cannot have an accurate understanding of psychology without personal experience jailbreaking your own mind, which requires excellent grasp of epistemology, metaphysics, and spirituality.

<p>
	That's a problem in the US too. My family doctor laughed at me when I asked him if I might have leaky gut. He say leaky gut is a myth that cannot exist.

<p>
	Idiot doctors are a dime a dozen. Except they usually charge you more than a dime for their terrible advice.
</p>

<p>
	Luckily you don't need their permission. You can order lab tests yourself. I order all my own lab work.

			3) You seem to recommend oils over grains as a calorieÂ source. Is this purely due to the autoimmune problems that whole grains often contribute towards? (In my own research, I have found some evidence that eating any extracted oils (e.g. olive oil, coconut oil, etc) is very bad for various aspects of health. I have experimented with this by cutting out all oils for multiple years, relying instead on whole grains as my main calorie source. Works fine for me now, but I am young.)

	I have since been doing more research and learning the importance of reducing oils.

<p>
	Whole grains seem to be healthier calorie source as long as you aren't sensitive or allergic to the grains. I would avoid gluten grains, for example. But something like quinoa seems healthier than oil.

	Brita filters and their ilk are junk. They will not filter out heavy metals properly.
</p>

<p>
	If your filter system doesn't not cost at least $250, it is junk. You cannot filter water properly too cheaply. Nor can your filter water properly with a single filter. A multi-stage system is necessary. 3-6 stages. 3 stages is the bare minimum.

<p>
	See my video: How To Shop For Healthy Food
</p>

<p>
	Your #1 priority should be to eliminate all processes foods and sugar.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you shop at Walmart, that's not so bad if you buy fruits and veggies. Don't buy anything in a box or anything with added sugars, or anything baked or anything with added vegetable oil.
</p>

<p>
	Waffles, pizza, cookies, baked goods, ice cream -- these are all highly processed and toxic foods that you should never eat again.

Just keep doing the work. Once you really understand you will no longer be asking me anything.

			These dated shamanic rituals carry a lot of risk when it comes to certain people and we need to develop a framework to keep people safe. Shamanic rituals are all good and sacred but we can always try to mitigate potential problems and make them safer.Â

<p>
	Yes, of course.
</p>

<p>
	But there is room for both. There will be shamanic stuff, and there will highly regulated, "official" medical type use of psychedelics. Going after shamanic practitioners is kinda silly in my view. They are just solo dudes. They will never be mainstream. If these PhD's want an "official" therapeutic system, then build it. Martin Ball is irrelevant to that goal.

	Truth should be pursued for its own sake.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't care about Truth, you really don't deserve awakening. And you will probably never get it. And even if you get some of it, you won't get all of it. And even then, you will bastardize it.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is more important than your happiness or whatever it might do for you.

<p>
	China will be forced to democratize.

<p>
	China will face all the same interal problems the US faces. It will take China some decades just to grow up into America's kind of problems.

	His confused. He keeps trying to crack the nut of God, but he cannot because of his attachments and paradigm. He's not willing to decostruct everything. He wants God yet he wants to maintain the civilizational traditions more.

<title>Psymposia pamphlets against Martin Ball</title>

<p>
	If her PhD was in physics, it would not be much better for purposes of discussing mystical practices.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is that Ball is engaging in mystical practices while these PhD's are discussing it in terms of "legal or therapeutic professional framework". This is like criticizing a dog for not adhering to legal frameworks. There is no legal framework for this shit. And there is not even a scientific one.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, I still don't really agree with Ball's approach. It's needlessly pushy in my opinion. That's the only real problem I see here. Never push a newbie to trip harder if he doesn't want to. It's important that the newbie take 100% responsibility to trip, so that he can never blame you for it. It must be his decision to go deeper. If the client does not give a definitive YES, don't give him any more 5-MeO. Pushing enlightenment on people is not good practice. It will backfire at some point.

<p>
	Of course the objective world and narrative world touch. What's he's missing is that reality is imaginary. Which is why they touch. The objective world is a dream. So is Christ. And JP is God.
</p>

<p>
	He's circling around the answer but will never put his finger on it because he's attached to science, objectivity, morality, meaning, realism, and Christianity.

So it will not cook as well as a proper $150 SS pan.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, SS pans can produce very nice sears. You just need to find the right temp. SS pans have a bit of a learning curve. But once you learn it, making dishes is very easy.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect an SS pan to be as non-stick as a Teflon or Ceramic pan. It never will be. But the pan can last you decades, unlike Teflon pans which you gotta change ever few years. So in the end, Teflon pans are actually more expensive.

<p>
	You can't really use the God word with a scientist because it instantly triggers all their defense mechanisms. The last thing a materialist scientist can admit is that there is a God. So if he knows that's what you're trying to convince him of, his mind will go into 100% denial mode. So it's better to refer to it as Consciousness or Infinity or Universe.

	The US will never be a one party state. Those kinds of tactics are only workable at lower levels of development where authoritarian methods are used.
</p>

<p>
	A one party state can only exist if it crushes all the other parties with force. And continues doing so chronically.

<p>
	I am a fan, but actually I very rarely use it.
</p>

<p>
	I think some of you guys get the wrong idea that I use it every day or every week. That's not the case.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that I don't use any substances chronically other than vitamins. Be careful not to create chronic consumption habits with chemicals.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, an occasional Modafinil is not a problem.
</p>

	Right after he sold it, he wrote a script for the new trilogy -- which Disney rejected -- and he got pissed. And he still does some work on the Mando show. So clearly he still has a passion for it.
</p>

<p>
	If I built a passion project like Star Wars, I would rather have it die than sell it off to Disney. What Disney is doing with Star Wars is worse than killing it. It would be like selling Actualized.org to Tai Lopez. I'd rather it just die.

<p>
	I think it would have been better for Lucas to just hire a great CEO and great directors and producers to take over LucasFilm, and he would only do some creative consulting as they take the reigns.

<title>Psymposia pamphlets against Martin Ball</title>

<p>
	Personally, when I trip sit someone, my policy is to stay completely silent and not interfere at all as much as I can stand.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard though. The ego really wants to interfere, get in there, and do stuff. But all that stuff is unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
	I try to only talk when the person wants me to talk. But it's not always easy to just sit silently.
</p>

<p>
	I think these shaman types get off on the idea that they are a vehicle for God and that their actions are important to the trip. So they get too proactive about it. Otherwise it would be hard for a shaman to justify his work/job. The shaman needs to bring his own personal touch to the process, put his own brand on it. Otherwise being a shaman would not be fun.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the other big mistake here is that 5-MeO-DMT should not be vaped, it should be plugged. Especially for newbie clients.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem with the show is that it is so transparently fan service. It's like the producers sat down at the table and ask, "Okay, how can we milk the original Star Wars fans in every way imaginable? Let's make a show solely about that!"
</p>

<p>
	The ending of season 2, with Luke, was so awful. Pure milking fan service. There is not a level too low that this show will not stoop to to milk the fans.
</p>

<p>
	The Star Wars universe has become so derivative. There's nothing original about it any more. Same old shit rehashed over and over again to milk rube fans. It's basically a form of abuse.

<p>
	That is pretty amazing.
</p>

<p>
	Lucas is certainly a more conscious guy than most Hollywood types.
</p>

<p>
	But still, did he really have to sell to Disney of all places? If there ever was a corporate devil, Disney would be it.

<p>
	Imagine if I sold Actualized.org to Disney.

<p>
	They make some valid points, but they are really punching down here. Martin Ball is basically a nobody. He's a solo shaman guy. He's not some legit established doctor or scientist, and the people who see him are hippies of his own ilk.
</p>

<p>
	This is not an issue I would spend any time worrying about. These "doctors" should be frying bigger fish, like the war on drugs. There is a sort of lack of priorities problem here. With all the shit going on in the world, Martin Ball is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	Credibility and authority is a very trick social game. Once you get into that game, you gotta be super careful because everyone will be looking to discredit you. You gotta suit their standards.
</p>

<p>
	Medicine, science, and academia are social reputation games. Your credibility in those fields matters way more than truth or depth of insight or consciousness.

<p>
	It's sort of funny to me how these "doctors" are deconstructing Martin Ball's practice line by line, as if they were combing through a legal document, when in fact Martin was just some hippie dude in hippie Oregon offering underground illegal shamanic work to other hippies.
</p>

<p>
	The things they say have some merit in that Martin Ball engages in what I consider some weird and unnecessary practices, but what the fuck does one expect when working with an underground hippie shaman doing illegal drugs? Of course it's not going to conform to some strict medical ethical codes. Lol
</p>

<p>
	These "doctors" might as well deconstruct how you and your buddy where sitting on the couch smoking weed and cracking jokes, but there was no consent from signed.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I think the biggest flaw in Martin's approach is that he is smoking the 5-MeO-DMT along with the client. It's much more responsible to trip sit sober. If he was sober he probably wouldn't be doing weird stuff. Two people tripping together can way out of hand as the insanity cross-multiplies.

<p>
	Him going to the dark side was not Episodes 1-3, it was selling to Disney.

	Imagine if the end of Star Wars was Luke selling the Rebel Alliance to the Emperor for $2 billion dollars and retiring in luxury.

<p>
	Don't get anything coated. It must be solid so nothing can scratch off.
</p>

<p>
	I mostly use bamboo cooking utensils. Very cheap and all-natural. Steel is great too.

	The core is aluminum. It is wrapped in steel. This should not be a problem. The steel is not merely a coating, it's a solid thick layer. No aluminum is getting through that steel.

	I was speaking assuming the conventional scientific paradigm. I was trying to use simple examples that meet the viewer where he's at, since this episode's goal was to use everyday examples to explain holism. This was not an episode about deconstructing the materialist paradigm.

<p>

<p>
	Just look at the reviews of the pan you linked. Look at how the coating scratches off in the pics. All ceramic coated pans scratch off like that. And where do you think that coating goes? In your food.

<p>
	You are dreaming up the universe, and humans too.
</p>

<p>
	You are not a human. You are God cosplaying a human.
</p>

<p>
	The true intent behind your question is this: could the universe exist without me?
</p>

<p>
	To which the answer is an obvious: NO!
</p>

<p>
	Since you created the universe.

	A lot of stuff you fry on a pan can simply be baked or steamed, which is much healthier and even less work. If you use foil, you don't even need to cleanÂ  anything.
</p>

<p>
	Charring food is not so healthy.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The urge to jump is precisely because you're so conscious you realize it makes absolutely no difference whether you jump or not. So why not jump? You want to jump just to prove to yourself that death isn't real and there is nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>
	Once, on a high dose of 5-MeO-DMT I got the urge to turn on the stove and press my hand on it, just to see that pain isn't real.
</p>

<p>
	So yeah, you do have to be careful. It is possible to do stupid and dangerous things on psychedelics. Psychedelics can eliminate all your normal inhibitions because they wipe out fear. Fear is basically what keeps you alive.

<p>
	No, it doesn't work like that. Such urges on psychedelics are brief. You will not go through all the hassle of going to your care just to get a key to jump out a window. By the time you walk to the your car you will forget you even cared about jumping.

You can't. You might just gag a bit. It's fine.
</p>

<p>
	Don't eat for at least 4 hours before tripping. Then you are safe. The stomach digests all its food within like 2-3 hours. Then it is empty.

<p>
	I get a strong urge to jump out the window on DMT. The love is so strong it literally makes you want to kill yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms not so much.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe you can bolt a simple padlock on the window and hide the key in your car. Just for peace of mind. Better safe than sorry. People sometimes to stupid things on high doses of psychedelics.

	Game A is rampant and inevitable, but each of us as individuals can take actions to minimize it.
</p>

<p>
	It's that simple. You can be less Game A-y.

<p>
	You don't follow me because I am a Wall Street or self-helpÂ grifter, you follow me because Actualized.org is in some small way above that shit.

Condoms break, slip, stuff leaks out, etc. It is foolish to expect all those stars to align for years and years. You've already rolled the dice many times and at some point you will roll snake eyes. Its just a matter of time.
</p>

<p>
	Given your age, everything I said is twice as relevant because at your age there's little chance you'll stay with him forever, even if there was no STD issue. You have to be realistic that relationships at that age are immature and tend to fizzle out rather quickly. Maybe if you were 40 years old and had no other options and you wanted to finally settle down you might have a case to make. But at 21?
</p>

<p>
	And living with herpes for the rest of your life from age 22 onward is really a bummer. The bulk of your sexual life is all ahead of you. Your prime years are 20-35. Don't squander it.

<p>
	A girl can tell me her perspective, but I don't need her advice for how to do what men do. She has no clue about that and will give bad advice. She does not understand the obstacles that men face in this domain and the pragmatics of the situation.

<p>
	A) Not necessarily. The whole point of socialism is to change that system.
</p>

<p>
	B) Even if there is an owner or a boss, that's not a problem per se. The problem is the systemic value extraction and exploitation. Owners and bosses deliberately conspire to squeeze hard working employees for value. Nothing is stopping Jeff Bezos from paying his employees double or triple. And they deserve it since they built that company. Bezos could still be ridiculously wealthy and Amazon could still be very profitable and successful even while paying x3 wages.

<p>
	It's a value extraction system. That value is generated by the lowest employees, then squeezed upwards and given to shareholders.
</p>

<p>
	That is the entire point of Wall Street.

This also seems contradictory.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The average Joe is hardworking, but does not generate much creative value. But even the most creative people who work for large companies get very little reward. Some average Joes are lazy, but they still do work and still deserve more pay. If they are super lazy then just pay them less.
</p>

<p>
	I believe that hardworking Joe should be paid more because his work is often very hard. Think of Amazon's lowest level employees who barely have enough time for pee breaks. And I believe the creative folks should also earn a lot more. Basically all workers should get paid way more while shareholders and executives should get way less.

<p>
	It's not just religion, it's the dogmatic mindset that religion instills in people.
</p>

<p>
	The problem in America is excessive stage Blue dogma the obstructs much-needed progress.
</p>

<p>
	Europeans are less enmeshed in that, thus they are more open to stage Green progressive governance.
</p>

<p>
	Christian fundamentalism has hijacked the minds of many Americans, making progressive politics nearly impossible. It's like trying to drag a mule up Mt Everest. So here we are.
</p>

<p>
	Europe is not perfect. They still have religion and stage Blue, just less so, and less powerful. Europe is more secular.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that religion does not work in isolation. Religion creates an entire worldview and paradigm that infects many other aspects of life: work, economics, healthcare, education, politics, etc. It all comes as one package such that when you try to get a person to question their ideas of abortion or capitalism or guns or education or immigrationÂ  -- they perceive it as an attack on their God. It's a giant tangled meme-complex, not just a few separate memes.

That is a sort of awakening in itself, hopefully when I realize no self through experience I do not trivialize life like they do, I donât think itâs a worthless perspective but itâs awful tough living in a dream just constantly telling the other dream people that they donât exist aha I feel like that is already implied but itâs a paradox and a mystery I guessÂ

<p>
	You can learn from anyone, but on this particular topic learning from women is just so unnecessary. It's like learning about makeup from men or learning hunting from a vegan.
</p>

<p>
	If women want to teach dating advice, let them teach it to women. Women do not really understand the specific sexual needs of men. Nor do they care.

<p>
	False. Every single psychic I visited was extremely confident in their abilities and suggestions. Too confidence. So confidence they often fooled me into their delusions.

<p>

<p>
	Trust me, if the pain gets high enough you will automatically surrender. Extreme pain actually destroys the ego. Pain is actually something that ego creates, so when the pain gets too high the ego cannot keep creating it any more.

<title>Trying to Escape my Job is Causing Suffering</title>

</p>

<p>
	If this was not the case, everyone would escape. But very few do.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically, to escape wage slavery requires working twice as hard as other people work.
</p>

<p>
	When I escaped my job I was working so hard, nonstop, days, nights, weekends, holidays -- it was so emotionally stressful I would just cry sometimes. It was extremely difficult. But here's the kicker: it was the best thing I ever did for myself.
</p>

<p>
	You get from life what you put into it.
</p>

<p>
	"Most men lead lives of quiet desperation."
</p>

<p>
	In the end it all boils down to what you're willing to put up with. You're willing to settle for a shitty life and boring job -- that's exactly what you'll get.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I would rather kill myself than work a boring job my whole life. Which is exactly why I was able to create an alternative for myself. I refused to settle. The pain of escaping wage slavery was high for me, but the pain of surrendering to a boring job was higher.
</p>

<p>
	This is nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	Sleeping with a guy who you definitely know has an STD is way more risking than sleeping with a random guy who has a tiny chance of having it.
</p>

<p>
	You are talking about 100% vs 10-20%. Anything is better than 100%. And you should not be fucking randos without a condom regardless. It's not like just because you've fucked a guy 20 times yet he has an STD, that the odds of you getting it diminish.

<p>
	Well, I understand your point. It's a sad situation. But also, is it really humane for him to infect you and other girls with it?
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with "idiot compassion". I know you have developed a soft spot for him, you love him, etc. But remember, romantic love tends to be a fickle thing. Chances are your relationship with him with end anyway in the next 5-10 years for other reasons. And then you'll be left single with herpes. That is not a good situation to put yourself in.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be so compassionate that you nail yourself to a cross. Also consider your own well-being. In fact, your health is more important than his desire for sex. At least it should be from your POV.
</p>

<p>
	Ditching him sounds harsh. But him knowingly giving you herpes sounds harsher.
</p>

<p>
	I understand you find yourself in an impossible situation. But nevertheless I think you should have higher standards and move on, as harsh as that sounds. He will understand. It's not like you're being a jerk here. You have the most legit reason ever for breaking a relationship. If you can't break a relationship over this, when can you?
</p>

<p>
	A healthy relationship should not involve you taking a bullet for him.
</p>

<p>
	What is your age? It would help to know that.

<p>
	Yeah, but Teflon is not some natural food product like sugar or chocolate. It is a chemical and if you research that specific chemical you will find that it is not some harmless thing to living organisms. Research that whole class of chemicals. It ain't good for ya.
</p>

<p>
	That Teflon also always scratches off over time and those flakes end up in your food. That can't be healthy. You are literally eating Teflon flakes like lead paint chips.

<p>
	Impossible to say because there are so many other variables at play with my health.
</p>

<p>
	It's not going to be something you feel immediately. Rather it might mean that 20 years from now you don't get cancer which you otherwise would have if you kept eating Teflon.
</p>

<p>
	It's just an unnecessary risk to take. You can easily use stainless steel pans for 95% of your cooking needs. The biggest problem with steel pans is that they suck for pancakes, crepes, and that sort of thing. But I don't eat those anyway. There may be ways to make those in the oven instead on parchment paper or silicone. There are many healthier methods of cooking than a frying pan which you should research, invest in, learn, and master.

</p>

<p>
	Be very careful believing such things. It's all hearsay.
</p>

<p>
	I went to 5 different psychics about my health issues and they all told be 5 different stories, all of them BS.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot simply trust a psychic.

	No, I'm saying the opposite. Employment is good because it usually involve genuine value creation.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The stealing has been abstracted by the system. It is systemic stealing. The point of the system is precisely to give you, the trader, plausible deniability. So that if anyone questions you, you can genuinelyÂ  say, "But I didn't break any laws. I just sold some paper to someone else who wanted to buy it. So how could that be evil?"
</p>

<p>
	You need to think holistically about how the whole Wall Street system works. The bottom line is this: If you earned a million dollars for clicking a few button on your computer, you obviously didn't work for it by creating any genuine stuff, therefore you must have stolen it from someone else who did.
</p>

<p>
	Where did that million come from? It came from exploitation of the labor of works of the company you invested into. That million really belongs to them. But you used the Wall Street system to separate it from them. So while you enjoy your million, some mother working at Walmart cannot afford to buy medicine for her sick child and he dies. But the system is designed such that you don't see that and don't care.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In a sense this is true. The difference is that I'm aware of that. And also the difference is that I worked hard for my money and it is not fair to me to have my money inflated. So I feel it is reasonable to hedge against inflation. You can say that's selfish, and you'd be right. It is. But life is selfish. I'm not just gonna sit by and watch my money deflate.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, we're all stuck in Game A to some degree. No matter how much you try to break out of Game A, you can't entirely avoid it. But you can at least not deliberately and gleefully double-down on Game A -- which is what stock get rich quick schemes do.

<p>
	Yes, and I'm okay with that. I also worked for money and when inflation happens someone else is getting a portion of my savings "for free" by eroding it.
</p>

<p>
	Some degree of competition is hard to avoid here. My point is to not participate in it too much. Participate in it as little as you can stomach.

</p>

<p>
	We want to create a society in which the hardest working people are most rewarded, not the opposite. A society in which clicking a few buttons earns you millions of dollars is not a healthy one.

<p>
	He's orbiting around the planet but has not yet landed.
</p>

<p>
	That's fine. It will take him many more trips and much more contemplation to really GET IT. Let him go at his own pace. He'll get it if he continue tripping and inquiring.

	Tony is geared toward stage Orange people. If you are just entering stage Orange then you will love Tony and he will be useful to you.
</p>

<p>
	But once you outgrow that, you should move on.
</p>

<p>
	Tony was useful to me in my stage Orange phase 12 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	Always remember, the most popular teachers are never the best. And he is the most popular. So that should tell you everything you need to know before you even buy his stuff.

<p>
	Food sticks more than a Teflon pan, but mostly it doesn't stick so bad. You just use some butter or oil and heat it proper. Don't put food into an unheated steel pan. Food tends to self-release as it cooks through.
</p>

<p>
	Cleaning steel pans is very easy. Pour some water in it. Let it stand a few hours and the food bits will scrub off easy with a brush.

<p>
	I make eggs in my steel pan all the time. Not a problem.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you are used to a Teflon pan nothing will be that easy or nonstick.
</p>

<p>
	Steal pan requires a bit more worl and care. But they also last a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	All pro chefs use stainless steel pans. There's just a bit of a learning curve. And they are 5x more expensive.

<p>
	All that is still finite.

<p>
	ThereÂ is only one actual INFINITY, of which all your conceptualizing about infintitiesÂ is a tiny part.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that INFINITY cannot be turned into a concept, which means the logical mind cannot ever grasp it. Which is why spiritual practices teach you to shut off your mind.

<p>
	Making that much is devilry and manipulation itself. The manipulation is built right into the market so that devils like you cans say, "See, I didn't steal from anyone." But actually, you did. Since you didn't generate any real value.
</p>

<p>
	That's capitalism. All the systems are unconsciously designed to steal value from people yet all the theives can tell themselves that didn't steal anything and thus sleep well at night.
</p>

<p>
	Your millions came from many working people losing what little they had. Your freedom costs 10-100 people to be wage slaves for life.

<p>
	How many Infinities can there be?
</p>

<p>
	ONE
</p>

<p>
	If you think there can be two Infinities, you weren't thinking of Infinity to beginÂ with.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that your idea of Infinity is actually finite, and thus not it.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to understand it is like this: How can there be two Gods? If God is the creator of everything, and you think there can be 2 or more of them, then which God created the other God? And what is the point of the 2nd one if the 1st one is more powerful than the 2nd, since it was first to exist.

<p>
	The key difference is that I do not use the stock market to make my money.
</p>

<p>
	It is a problem when you guys try to use the stock market as your method of getting rich.
</p>

<p>
	Stocks are fine for holding some savings and getting a 8% average annual return. The problem comes when you expect your stocks to give you 10x returns and make you rich.
</p>

<p>
	Make yourself rich, then put some of your riches into the market to avoid inflation.
