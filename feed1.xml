<title>100 mg of bufo alvarius secrtetion. (5-Meo-DMT)</title>

<p>
	100mg is not really enough to work with. That's like equivalent to 1-2 doses, but you will probably waste a few doses just testing and perfecting your vape method.
</p>

<p>
	You'll need more substance to do this properly, with multiple ramped up doses. It would be foolish to vape 100mg straight up. You'll want to build up to that gradually.
</p>

<p>
	It must be vaped.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Enough reading books! You must now actually do the inner work. Books are NOT inner work.
</p>

<p>
	Try some psychedelics and go visit some spiritual communities. There are many spiritual communities around if you just search.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, people get caught in their beliefs. But so do you. You're not out of the woods yet. Now you must move beyond the mind. Now the real work begins.
</p>

<p>
	It is the nature of this work that few people will understand you. But you can make a handful of friends who will be at your level.

So nothing more can be done to help.
</p>

<p>
	When you are ready to admit that everything you've be taught was a lie, then come back and let's talk.
</p>

<p>
	You have no interest in Truth. You are interested in defending your preexisting position. That won't cut it if you want to realize God.

<p>
	5-MeO is the most direct path towards God-realization. No other method is as fast or as clinically precise.

<p>
	15 mins is all it takes.

<p>
	The trick is handling it.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's hard to say because there are not just two experiences (psychedelic vs meditative) there are literally hundreds of different mystical experiences, states, insights, and realizations, and with various degrees of depth and breadth.
</p>

<p>
	The mystical terrain is sprawling. No one man has seen it all.
</p>

<p>
	The 5 blind men and the elephant is an important metaphor here.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelic experiences can be weak or deep. Meditative satori can be weak or deep. It all depends on how you're doing it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Synthesizing 5-MeO is very challenging. Some random guy is not going to know how to do it. He will more likely give you some random research chemical.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that there of dozens of analogue or similar substances which are far easier to source, like 5-MeO-MiPT, but are not at all the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	When you are getting 5-MeO-DMT you absolutely must verify the source through reliable user reviews. It must be clear that it's pure 5-MeO-DMT. Only professional high-grade labs make it. You cannot extract it in your basement like DMT.

</p>

<p>
	Like I keep saying, there's many layers to this thing. To realize that you are God is a very distinct realization and it's not the same as realizing Nothingness. Even though God of course is Nothingness. But that's not all there is to God.
</p>

<p>
	There are many distinct realizations to have here. Doubt and dispute me all you like, but I'm telling you how it is.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate: What is God?
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot in this.

<p>
	Consciousness is Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	And Nothingness is not other than Form.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to over-emphasize Nothingness to the exclusion of Form. That is only half-enlightenment. You must go full-circle to realize that Form and Formlessness are totally identical. That is the highest realization.

This is not a religion, nor an ideology, nor even a philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	Everything I say you must discover in your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	If you carefully look at what "good" and "bad" are in your direct experience you will notice that they are thoughts of your ego-mind. So you are literally creating them. This is not an opinion or a theory. Look and see how your own mind works.
</p>

<p>
	You must be curious enough to investigate your self's functioning. This is self-science.

<p>
	God has infinite free Will. It used its Will to design a universe in which individual agents like you also have some of it's free will. A human is like a mini-God. The more conscious you are the more free will you have.
</p>

<p>
	I will shoot a video about this soon. It's a bit tricky but also very very important to understand.

If you could do that, you'd already be enlightened. So obviously that cannot work.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is a radical shift in consciousness in which you realize that you were never born and that your whole life was a dream.
</p>

<p>
	You become so conscious that you awaken from life to realize it never happened and that you are actually formless, immortal, and God.
</p>

<p>
	This is outside the realm of any kind of experience you've ever had. It's beyond "experiencing" altogether. It's beyond "life" as you know it. It's a totally new thing. And yet, it's not located anywhere else but right here, right now. Which is what makes it so bafflingly paradoxical.
</p>

<p>
	What you're failing to account for in your reasoning is CONSCIOUSNESS! Your level of consciousness totally determines what you consider real, possible, and impossible. So there's just no way to get to enlightenment from where you presently are. And yet, it can still be done. It requires a radical leap in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	A good way to think of it is that you die and discover what lies on the other side of death. It's not anything you can imagine. It's a lot better than you can imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics make it much easier.
</p>

<title>This Week's Video Failed To Upload</title>

<p>
	The video was uploaded but Youtube refused to process it. Stuck at 95%. Which means it cannot be published.
</p>

<p>
	I'm traveling until Tuesday so I can't reupload it until then.
</p>

<p>
	So we'll just have to wait <img alt=":(" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/sad.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/sad@2x.png 2x" title=":(" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Never had this happen before in 5 years. There's probably a bug in the video file itself. Requiring a re-render and a re-upload.
</p>

<p>
	Now you must fend for yourself. May God help you.
</p>

	No. Look closer to home.

<p>
	JP's worldview and politics are what lead to global warming, unchecked capitalism, the Iraq War, dronestrikes, military industrial complex, Big Pharma, and coups like that currently being staged in Venezuela.
</p>

<p>
	It's basically Bush-era Neo-Con politics. That is right-wing politics which JP is basically defending.

<p>
	Post-modernism doesn't need to be defended. It just needs to understood and integrated.
</p>

<p>
	Most people suffer from lack of understanding of relativism. JP is denying the highly important truth of moral relativity. This is an error which will cost many lives.

<p>
	JP has not yet evolved to post-modernism. Not to mention post-post-modernism.

To know itself fully in all possible ways. To accomplish this God must live through an infinite number of creatures.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot know itself otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	For God to exist, it must be all things. So here you are.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	How could God know what mortality is unless it lived through mortality? To know a thing you must experience it.
</p>

<p>
	That's the genius of the design. You'd have to be crazy selfless to do it. To put yourself into a gas chamber, for example. That's exactly what God does.

<p>
	Can you write up how you make your tea? I thinks folks here might like that.
</p>

<p>
	Start a new thread about it.
</p>

<p>
	And if folks have other methods like alcohol extraction they can share that there as well. I'm curious how to do alcohol extraction. We need a step by step guide.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A) Correct understanding is not limited to experience. Duduction and intuiton are also possible.
</p>

<p>
	B) I have lots of experience with visualization and intention-setting, which is effectively the highest form of prayer.
</p>

<p>
	You might say I use prayer all the time. But it does not look like traditional Christian prayer.
</p>

<p>
	I basically use LoA to attract God to me. Of course I already know I am God, but what this does is make me more God-like, more pure in my thoughts, feelings, and actions.
</p>

<p>
	So this kind of prayer is a great way to deepen one's embodiment post-awakening. It gives you that "Passion of the Christ."
</p>

	What Trump does is get large loans and wastes them while creating a public image of having used them to make money. He manipulates the system to get more and more loans. So he's always playing with other people's money.
</p>

<p>
	It's a classic scam strategy. Which is why every US bank refuses to lend him money. Which is why he had go to Russia for loans. And the Russians are corrupt at fuck. Russia is a mafia state. They use him to launder billions of dollars out of Russia and into real estate.
</p>

<p>
	That's how real business is done son. This is no joke. The Russians don't fuck around. They are stone-cold raqueteers, crafty as the devil. Way craftier than Trump. He is their pawn.

			According to Bible there are some things that happened in the world that didn't even come into God's mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			"And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire unto Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin." - Jeremiah 32:35
		</p>

		<p>
			So at least the Bible is teaching clearly that everything that exists is not always God's will or his invention.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The Bible is the work of corrupt devils.
</p>

<p>
	Jesus did not write The Bible.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing which is not in God's mind. How can God be unlimited and all-powerful yet overlook some occurance? You make a mockery of God by thinking this way.
</p>

<p>
	EVERYTHING is God's design. Not one hair has been overlooked.
</p>

<p>
	God designed individuals to have a portion of its Will. So that you as an individual may experience what it's like to be a creator. God does not interfer with an individual's exercise of will. That would violate the whole design and purpose of life. God's will is that you act however you will. And so it is. If you will to act like a devil, God will love you no matter what. But other people may hate you. Thus what you call "evil" is pseudo-created. It only exists within people's judgments of you. And your own judgments of you. God does not judge. God is pure Love.
</p>

<p>
	An all-intelligent being will never judge itself. Because judgment is lack of understanding. To judge is to deny Truth, and God is Truth. Since God is all there is, if it were to judge anything in existence it would be judging itself, which would be falsehood and delusion.
</p>

<p>
	You would have God be deluded? Haha! No, friend, the delusion is with you.
</p>

<p>
	Judge not lest ye be judged.
</p>

God is bountiful.
</p>

<p>
	The clarity of your connection to God determines your ability to summon help. Most people are very, very disconnected so they get little help. You have to invite God's help, and most devils don't have enough wisdom to do that. They are too busy being devils. A devil will actually refuse God's help.
</p>

<p>
	Devils love to pray. But not listen.

<p>
	That's the kicker! Trump lost $400 million of Daddy's money. Trump is not a billionaire, was never a billionaire, and he does not know how to make money other than by conning you into thinking he's good at making money.
</p>

<p>
	Lol. The whole thing is a con from start to finish. Trump is a loser -- the very thing he hates most to admit. Even when he wins, he loses. Everything he touches gets lost.

	The devilry of your post is worse than the devilry of your manipulations. Not only did you manipulate the contest, you come here trying to manipulate this spiritual community. But we see right through your bullshit.

<p>
	Poor devil wants sympathy for this devilry. It's okay devil. God still loves you. Nothing you do will shake God's love for you.
</p>

<p>
	But as for your fellow human devils, they might eat you alive. Devils love to eat their own. Don't expect them to be as kind to you as God. Don't judge them when their hatred rains down on you. That's just your karma being served to you.
</p>

<p>
	You are judging yourself. The God in you sees the devil in you. Which is why you have a guilty conscience.

<p>
	Haha, YES, you're "wrong". All that is judgment and ego.
</p>

<p>
	You think God didn't invent everything you call evil? So you would call God evil?
</p>

<p>
	There is no evil. There is only your judgment. Whatever you believe becomes true, but only for you.
</p>

<p>
	Stop judging God. Stop thinking you know better than God.
</p>

<p>
	The psychopath is the one who judges. You see how you've got everything backwards? The evil you see is the evil your mind creates.
</p>

<p>
	So actually you are being a devil. A devil is one who judges God and calls Goodness evil. That's what you are doing. But of course you are not conscious enough to realize you are doing it. You think you are defending the Good by calling out evil. But that's precisely how you create evil.
</p>

<p>
	You have to realize that morality is a delusion. Nothing is right or wrong. You have complete freedom. But there are natural consequences to all actions -- which also are never right or wrong.
</p>

<p>
	All of this is very tough to swallow for religiously raised folks. What you have to understand is that religion has been corrupted by devilry from the very beginning. So everything you were taught about morality was actually the work of judgmental devils, who succeed in implanting a mind-virus into you which flips all truth upside-down. So actual Truth turns out to be the very opposite of what religion taught you about morality.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	The devil sure is sneaky! He's reading this right now and still he refuses to admit he's a devil. He is totally convinced he's an angel.
</p>

<p>
	Prayers for wanting to merge with God, or wanting to be universally loving, are not delusional. They can be very powerful.
</p>

<p>
	The worst form of prayer is the materialistic and dualistic kind, where you are begging for a father-figure God to give you materialistic stuff. That makes a mockery of prayer.

<p>
	The only way to conquer the desire for sex is to replace it with a desire for God.
</p>

<p>
	But even then, it's tricky. You must seriously purify your mind and body. You need nondual consciousness to do it.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15659-santerton/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="15659" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15659-santerton/" rel="">@santerton</a> For fucks sake, STOP WATCHING MGTOW. Period.
</p>

<p>
	And never visit 4chan ever again in your life.
</p>

<p>
	It's all toxic, dogmatic, egotistical, unconscious, devilsh garbage.
</p>

<p>
	It is not even worth debunking or arguing against. It's so false and wrong it's hopeless.
</p>

<p>
	MGTOW, RedPill, and Incels are the American equivalent of Al Qaeda Islamist radicalism. By ingesting their videos and discussions your mind is getting programmed with that mind-virus. That happens because as you watch and listen, it appeals to your desperate needy ego. Triggering all of your worst fears, hates, insecurities, and victim mentality.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get better with women, you can do so and have amazing loving sexy relationships. But it will take self-improvement and spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	Dating coaches are not liars. Dating coaches can teach you how to get really good with attracting women. I have interacted with dozens of dating coaches and their advice is top-notch for attraction. Not so good for relationships. For solid relationships you will need a more spiritual approach which you can layer on top of the attraction advice.
</p>

<p>
	Once you become spiritual and consciousness enough, sex will not even be important to you any more. You will be so deeply happy without sex that chasing women will be a joke.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is 1000x more enjoyable than any sex you will ever have. With that said, you can do both.
</p>

<p>
	Here's the practical solution for you: Stop sitting in your Mom's basement browsing toxic forums, and GO OUT and talk to real females. You will never get laid by sitting at home. It is not physically possible.
</p>

<p>
	See how simple the solution is? Yet you refuse to do it. Because it takes emotional labor to face your fears and grow yourself. You much prefer to sit at home and rant against how bad women are and how nothing can change.
</p>

<p>
	Rule #1 of all personal development: You must take 100% responsibility for your life, your beliefs, your feelings, your situation. No one is to blame.
</p>

<p>
	MGTOW is not a teaching. It's egotical, reactionary rantings driven by fear, hate, insecurity, selfishness, woundedness, and neediness. It's very similar to Hitler's rants against the Jews and communists.
</p>

<title>Is Sex a Need or a Desire?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/34615-is-sex-a-need-or-a-desire/?do=findComment&amp;comment=419147</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Need/desire is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	You are the one defining them. Whatever you say is a need becomes a need.
</p>

<p>
	Strictly speaking there is no need to do anything. You could just lay down and die. There is not even a need to live.
</p>

<p>
	Practically speaking, sex is one of the most powerful human drives. Good luck ignoring it. It's designed to be unignorable.
</p>

<p>
	By saying that sex is a need all we're saying is: it's a core biological drive which dominates human survival. It can be overcome, but not easily, and not through something as simplistic as NoFap. You might as well be practicing NoShit.
</p>

<title>MDMA Psychotherapy vs Regular Psychotherapy</title>

</p>

<p>
	You can either do psychedelics on your own and that itself is the therapy.
</p>

<p>
	Or you can consider doing psychedelics with a shaman like with Ayahuasca or toad venom or ibogaine clinics in Costa Rica, Canada, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Traditional talk therapy certainly works, but nothing compares to the therapeutic power of psychedelics. You don't need a therapist to administer it. The psychedelic is 100x wiser than any silly therapist. The therapist is more of a distraction than of help during a trip. The psychedelic will show you everything you need to know about yourself and your issues if you come to it with a genuine intention. All that's required is that you want to know the TRUTH about your issue. That's all. The psychedelic will show you all the answers, as much as you're willing to stomach.
</p>

<p>
	Just make sure you follow a proper tripping protocol. And start with small doses.
</p>

<p>
	It's very smart to take charge of your own mental and psychological issues. No one can really sort you out but you. Which is why traditional talk therapy is so gradual. The answers are all inside you, if you'd only sit down with a notepad and introspect.
</p>

<p>
	You can teach yourself how to diagnose and troubleshoot all of your own psychological problems.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you have the cash to burn, talk therapy could be good too. But you can't just rely on talk therapy to fix your life. Your life will require a lot deeper work to truly sort out. No talk therapist even understands how deep this work goes. So it's worth your time to learn how to self-help.
</p>

<title>How to stop panicking in altered states of consciousness?</title>

<p>
	If at first you don't succeed, try try again.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that simple. You try stuff until you improve and master it.
</p>

<p>
	Never judge your progress by a couple of attempts. It takes many attempts before you learn to surrender.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes it takes 50 attempts. Sometimes 100 attempts. This is how mastery is done. See my old video called: Mastery
</p>

<p>
	Shamanic breathing is not so hard. You can probably get good at it in 10-20 attempts.
</p>

<title>Is realizing God the most 'valuable' thing I can do?</title>

</p>

<p>
	The soul only has one function and desire: full realization and embodiment of God. That's all it wants and the only thing it is after. Everything else is scenery along the way.
</p>

<p>
	This is all that life is about. There is nothing else.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just about joy, there is literally nothing else to do but stall it out and deny it, or do it.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of vision and wisdom to actually do it though. Talking about it is all too easy. You have to get very clear that this is what you want.
</p>

	You are expecting too much. It's too early for that yet.
</p>

<p>
	Be happy with mid to high Green politicians.
</p>

<p>
	Politics is a very pragmatic sport. You can't be too idealistic about it. It's not about perfection, it's about gradual incremental improvements. The best you can get is the best you can get.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, society is still pretty damn good in America or Europe. Compared to how society was 500 years ago.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The ego-mind returns surprisingly soon. Like within 30 minutes you're back into standard ego operating mode. But of course shaken to your core. It's often a relief to return to ordinary life. But there is also a deep regret for losing that full-on God-consciousness because nothing in life will ever top that.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes the God-consciousness lingers for a few hours or even into the next day.
</p>

<p>
	The saddest part about 5-MeO is that you cannot be that high 24/7/365. Losing touch with God is one of the deepest pains. But as you awaken more, you will start to realize that God is present all the time, even if you're not on a peak. This takes a lot of tripping to start to realize.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is right here, right now, at all times. But only if you're awake enough to see it. It does zero good telling an unawakened newbie that enlightenment is right here, right now, at all times. He just cannot see it. He needs actual breakthroughs and mystical experiences to demonstrate it to himself. That's where the 5-MeO comes in so handy.
</p>

<p>
	After enough tripping, your whole life will start to feel like a trip. The materialist paradigm slowly gets snuffed out forever. I no longer experience myself as in a material world. The world gradually becomes self-luminous.
</p>

<p>
	Weed definitely can raise consciousness. It's been used by yogis in India for this purpose for thousands of years.
</p>

<p>
	Of course most people use it irresponsibly, just like they do with food, drink, sex, and pretty much everything else. Blame the user not the substance.
</p>

<p>
	It takes great care to use substances for spiritual growth. It's not for kids and fools.

	Seperation is illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Look at your hand. There are 5 fingers, but all the fingers are part of one hand. You are like one of those fingers which isn't realizing that it's also the entire hand. There is no boundary between a finger and a hand. Finger and hand ONE thing!

	Your heart is still closed. You still do not realize what Love is.
</p>

<p>
	Once you do that, it will soften you, and you will discover what life is really about, what God is really about.
</p>

<p>
	Intellect without Love is a barren desert.
</p>

<p>
	To transcend Yellow requires the greatest leap of all into the realm of the Absolute. You must have many mystical experiences which ultimately lead to the realization of God.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	So I was basically quoting that. Personally I have not been to see it for myself.
</p>

<p>
	Generally-speaking Northern Europe is starting to dip their toes into Yellow. But it's still very early. There are no solid Yellow governments yet. But they will probably emerge first in Northern Europe.
</p>

<p>
	This is rather technical stuff which requires some deep reading. It cannot be philosophized about casually.

<p>
	Yes, you are permanently changed. But the ego still returns. It's just more purified.
</p>

<p>
	The change is subtle but significant. Especially after a dozen trips. Those incremental changes add up to more than the sum of their parts.
</p>

<p>
	Basically it's no different than how it works with meditation retreats. One retreat will never totally change you. But the retreats add up over the years to something significant.

<p>
	There is Goodness as an Absolute. It's what you would do if you were totally selfless and unconditionally loving. It's literally what God is doing to design this whole show. It is a Good which has no opposite.
</p>

<p>
	What you can do if fully align your agenda with that of God. Then your will becomes God's Will. This would be the ultimate way to live, but right now it is totally out of your reality. First you must realize what God is.

	Of course I'm sure weed would open up my consciousness, but I have no attraction towards it for whatever reason.

<p>
	Of course, of course.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help you discover yourself. And since the Self is all that exists, through that you can discover anything of importance.

			You can abolish private property in a way by realizing that it is an illusion. But, the illusion seems practical.

		<p>
			On paper, I own a house in an apartment, but I don't feel that I own it. It takes only a few big mistakes to lose it. Ownership is an illusion but still practical. Even a low-consciousness person perceives the illusion of house ownership. When ownership is fragile, you realize its illusory nature. On paper, you own a house. In reality, you don't own a shit. You don't really own the money in your bank account, either. The government can lock your bank account any time. Maybe, not your bitcoin wallet.

		<p>
			To me, ownership and various economic concepts are just a game. But, it's a game that can make you go through a lot of pain.

<p>
	I mean abolishing private property in practice. So for example, if you start a business, the government will own it. If you buy a house, your local town/village will own a majority stake in it. That's true communism. And no one is seriously advocating for it.

<p>
	Perception, thought, and creation are not two.
</p>

<p>
	The universe is hell for devils because of how they perceive and how they think -- which is their creation.
</p>

<p>
	How you think about reality affects reality directly. By thinking of the world as a place where you exist, where others can harm you, and where one day you will die, you literally create your own hell.

	The leap from Stage Red to Blue was a major leap in human evolution.

<p>
	If anyone can find some links to the donation campaigns in Oregon and California, please post them here.
</p>

<p>
	Then I will post them on my blog for all to see.
</p>

<p>
	I wish I had known about this Denver campaign earlier so I could promote it.
</p>

<p>
	Jesus did not leave a shitstorm. He spread the word about God as best as he could in his era.
</p>

<p>
	You have to remember that people were basically barbarians and slaves back then. So for them, Christianity was cutting edge high tech stuff, like the iPhone of their time.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that 99% of people could not read back then. And there were no books!
</p>

<p>
	Also, stop taking the word "devil" literally. These are nuanced teachings which require a highly intuitive and figurative mind to properly decipher.
</p>

<p>
	See, this is what I mean by combining spirituality and politics.
</p>

<p>
	This is how society self-actualizes at the collective level.
</p>

<p>
	Conscious and engaged citizenry produces a better society.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe it's time to donate some coin to the Oregon campaign. They have a good shot at passing it with all those hippie Oregonians.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but Green is still not thinking about it systemically. Green is mostly doing it from her heart. That's all great, but it is not the kind of full-bore systemic thinking I described.
</p>

<p>
	Green is still looking at the situation from a personal agenda level, it just so happens that saving the Earth is now part of her personal agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Yellow and above is more impersonal. And yet still very personal! Tier 2 is more detached.
</p>

<p>
	I don't hate Orange. It's just limited.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I'm no fan of dogmatic Muslims. They can be extremely annoying.
</p>

<p>
	Blindly being right doesn't count for much. An atheist is still more developed than a Blue Muslim.
</p>

<p>
	We need more Green Muslims.

<title>How can Sadhguru initiate so many people into a non-dual experience at once?</title>

</p>

<p>
	It is critical in this work to stand on your own two feet. You must become totally self-guiding in the end, otherwise you have not realized your full Godhood. As God you can have no one to hold your hand. You must become your own authority.
</p>

<p>
	For this reason I do not agree with the path of devotion. To me it is not the highest path. It still has that subtle duality of me vs my guru. That must collapse.
</p>

<p>
	There is only one thing in the universe: YOU!
</p>

<p>
	It feels very good to not need any gurus. You take full ownership of your creation. Of course you can still learn from people. I learn from 100s of sources. I just keep a professional distance. I don't try to crawl up their holy ass hole.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like his approach. It's far too simplistic, black and white, and non-integral. It does not recognize that people are at very different stages of development. For a stage Red person, belief in Christ can be a positive life transforming event which moves him up to Blue, and it is legit spirituality, just not the highest level of nondual awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Nor do I think he has realized the deepest level of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Mindlessly destroying all beliefs not going to cut it. 
</p>

<p>
	I would much rather you follow Sadhguru than that guy.
</p>

<p>
	Just consider this: if humanity does not take climate change seriously over the next 20 years, there will be massive Purple, Red, and Blue casualities. Tens of millions of people will die, not to mention the irreversible environmental damage.
</p>

<p>
	Meanwhile JP is bitching about post-modernism.
</p>

<p>
	It's a total red herring. We got serious issues to deal with.

<p>
	How many times do I have to say that LP is not a selfish thing, it is the highest form of love and service to the world!
</p>

<p>
	You are turning a beautiful thing into a tool of the devil.
</p>

<p>
	You must align your purpose with the good of the world.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming a politician is not at all necessary to help the world. There are literally millions of opportunities to help the world every year. You just have to open your eyes and see how everything is interconnected.

<p>
	God created relationship so that the depth of your love could really be put to the test. It's easy to love the world when you're sitting alone in a cave because there are no fools or devils to deal with.
</p>

<p>
	Try being enlightened while running for president. Now there's a real test of your consciousness!
</p>

<p>
	Osho was an enlightened master, but his community was full of devilry.
