<p>
	Youtube is definitely broken. I'm finding it impossible to upload videos. Every upload succeeds on my end but fails to process on their end.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/5260978?hl=en" rel="external nofollow">https://support.google.com/youtube/thread/5260978?hl=en</a>
</p>

<p>
	I basically cannot upload videos any more unless they fix this.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't seem that they are even aware of the problem yet.

<p>
	If you could, you certianly couldn't explain how you do it via any conventional human paradigm of understanding.
</p>

<p>
	It would be a level of connection to God-consciousness beyond anything words could convey.
</p>

<p>
	I suspect it is possible. But only for exceptionally advanced yogis. You won't get there through self-inquiry.

<p>
	Accepting and making sense of it took a long time. It's too amazing to believe. You see it and then you wonder: did I really see that? Couldn't be because it's too good to be true. And yet you know it's absolutely true.

<p>
	The problem is that's poison to your body and mind. And you're squandering a good opportunity.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you go to Disneyland and rather than going on all the rides you lock yourself in the toilet.

<p>
	Technically there's no problem. But it's also a waste.

</p>

<p>
	I'm sorta semi-lucid but not 100% God-mode lucid. Which is what to me is the ultimate goal.
</p>

<p>
	Insight is important and good, peaks are good, but most importantly is the question of your minute to minute lucidity.
</p>

<p>
	I believe it's possible to be in full God-mode all the time.
</p>

<p>
	When you do 5-MeO it clearly shows you how unwoke you still are. It's a whole order of magnitude more wokeness than ordinary life. It's clear to me that such total wokeness is possible. And I certianly don't have that yet.

<title>Why can't spiritual work heal the shadow?</title>

<p>
	Sometimes it can. But meditation is usually more focused on hitting higher states of consciousness rather than addressing buried psychological baggage.
</p>

<p>
	There are many layers to your mind which root many of your personal problems which meditation is largely unconcerned with.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of Zen masters and enlightened masters can still have significant shadow.

		</p>

		<p>
			how do you accept your friends viewpoints, knowing that they are wrong. i've said a few things to my parents and its like talking to a brick wall, not that i expect any less ofcourse. but i'm starting to build up this energetic feeling that by the power of grace, everybody in the world finds out enlightenment is an actual thing and i can then point to my parents and say i fucking told you so! this is what i meant the whole time! even imagining the situation is giving me joy beyond belief as opposed to them thinking that i've personally been brainwashed and without logic, blindly accepting what others say like the fact i am god etc.. 
		</p>

		<p>
			like its obvious that you probably don't talk to them about how you see reality (those that don't know) not like fucking ralston lol, my real question is how do you tolerate what they say and be bothered to reply with an answer that you may know not to be true
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I mostly keep to myself. I'm not a very social person. I am happy rolling solo most of the time.
</p>

<p>
	A few intimate friends and lovers are no problem. Discussing with them is no problem usually.

<p>
	Because society makes it easy, herding you into it like a sheep.
</p>

<p>
	Now you are on your own.
</p>

<p>
	You can actually learn much faster and deeper as an adult. But no one will motivate you. It's all on you.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, since you are now trying to move beyond the center of gravity of your culture, they will actively drag you down and discourage you from trying.
</p>

<p>
	So it's all on you twice over.
</p>

<p>
	Plus you gotta pay your bills, so it's all on you thrice over.
</p>

<title>Tips for integrating a not so pleasant LSD experience ? [Trip report + questions]</title>

It's not merely a matter of belief. Belief is not what creates your body, for example, but your body IS a hallucination. So this process of creation is not as easy a beleiving whatever the hell you want and it appears.
</p>

<p>
	But if you are tripping on psychedelics they open your mind up so much that you can literally imagine a devil and see it materialize before your eyes. But this is not just belief. It's the machinery of Universal Mind which spawns physical reality. You cannot access this machinery easily in ordinary states of human conscious. Because your sense of reality must be maintained to maintain your human life. Your mind works very hard to create a solid sense of "reality" otherwise the game of human life would be up.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is pervasive due to the ego's survival function and your belief in death. Growing up is all about learning to master your fear and negative thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Yes and no. Since God is all God ultimately creates all. Since you are God, you create all, including your own suffering.
</p>

<p>
	That's the trickery of nonduality. All formulations of it never quite capture both sides of it.

<p>
	Since you are God, you are the only authority that exists. So whatever you hold as the case becomes your reality. If you think you deserve punishment, you will get. If you think some adult is your authority figure, that becomes your reality. If you think you are crazy, you become so.
</p>

<p>
	What the psychedelic ultimately shows you is that all of reality is your own projection. So be careful what you think or you just might get it. If you think scary thoughts you will get scary experiences. That's how people create their own living hells.
</p>

<p>
	Such "bad" trips as yours are all part of the journey. It was exactly what you needed at this time in your life. The next trip will be different if you've learn your lessons.
</p>

<p>
	Such "bad" trips are necessary to teach you the importance of respecting these powerful substances. The lesson is: these are not toys. So next time you will be much more careful with your protocol, attitude, and setting.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically practice can get in the way of spirituality in the same way that religious church rituals do.
</p>

<p>
	Yet at the same time, without serious practice you will not get very far.
</p>

<p>
	That's what makes this work so tricky. It's a catch-22.

	Except since you are God, you get to say what happens. You have God's Will running right through you.

	Creation does not have to be done out of lack. In fact, God created the whole universe not out lack but out of love.

<title>MBTI, Spiral Dynamics Connection?</title>

<p>
	This was explained in my last Spiral Dynamics video.
</p>

<p>
	No, you cannot map types to stages. Types are an independent axis. Just like how male/female cuts across all stages equally. Do not try to map males to Red or females to Green. Likewise with personality types.
</p>

<p>
	And stages and types are not the only axes. There is more. See my vid about that.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	If you are God, the question then becomes, what do you want to create? Because creation is the only game in town and there is no one but you to tell you what you should create, so whatever you decide is worthwhile to do, is what you as God will create. If you decide that nothing is worthwhile to create, that will be what you created.
</p>

<p>
	If you decide to be an angle, that's how God created angels. If you decide to be a devil, that's how God created devils. If you don't decide anything and just follow the path of least resistance, that's how God created devils. Being a devil is the default condition. Being an angle takes deliberate intention.
</p>

<p>
	And so the world is exactly as it is. A perfect inevitability.
</p>

<p>
	That is not what's being said.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation can reveal the emptiness of suffering but that doesn't help those who are not liberated. Which is why helping everyone awaken is a big goal of Buddhism and all spiritual traditions.
</p>

<p>
	The only way for the entire world to escape suffering is for the entire world to awaken together. That is exactly what evolution is moving towards: unity and love.

<title>why do you come back after you die</title>

<p>
	For the same reason people don't permanently die from a few samadhis during meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Your body/mind is not so fragile because its job is to survive at all costs. You are a survival machine which protects you against your own stupidities. The body cannot actually trust the ego to keep it alive, which is why it tortments the ego with pain, suffering, and desire. That's the body making sure the ego doesn't do something stupid that gets both of them killed.

</p>

<p>
	Ego can certainly co-opt God for it own devilish purposes. That does not negate God in any way though. God is still there.

<p>
	The biggest problem affecting the world is that people don't meditate.
</p>

<p>
	If every politician meditated and woke up, world hunger and poverty would be solved overnight.
</p>

<p>
	All material world problems are the result of lack of consciousness and unconditional love. If people were conscious that they are God's, there would not be war, theft, rape, murder, slavery, exploitation, corruption, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Look at Trump. The only thing that can cure him is meditation, which he will of course never do. So the world is as ugly as it is.
</p>

<p>
	What you don't understand yet is that all political problems are self-created by people like you. Once you realize that you will see how all these problems can be solved. You cannot solve these problems at the level of consciousness that created them.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying you should ignore poverty and war. Just the opposite, I am saying you should wake up and realize that you are contributing to them.
</p>

<p>
	Unconscious people are actually incapable of caring about ecology, poverty, inequality, and war. They only care about it when it serves their ego to do so. Thus nothing gets resolved because the care is not deep enough or all-inclusive enough. Egos resist equality because they are too threatened and scared by it. They are too busy hoarding resources for themsleves, thereby creating poverty, slavery, rape, genocide, and war.
</p>

<title>As GOD Why we can't creat any thing</title>

<p>
	Firstly, you CAN heal your body. Healing is an entire discipline. You can increase the heal rate of cancer through shear mind power. This has been proven by clinical science long ago. There exist clinics which teach how to heal cancer with mind power. And of course it works. Not 100%, but you'd be surprised how effective it can be.
</p>

<p>
	There also exist millions of psychic healers who can help heal you. The shit Jesus did is not merely a myth! An exceptionally conscious mystic will have psychic superpowers that you can hardly believe. Of course it's not 100% perfect. Don't try to formalize it. You can't formalize psychic abilities within a materialist paradigm because they are immaterial and superconscious.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, since you are God, and you can create anything out of thin air, you created this human life where you get to experience limitation. You created limitation for yourself. You just forgot. So until you wake up you will be puzzled. After you wake up you will understand that you did this to yourself precisely because you have infinite power.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, by becoming more conscious your ability to create using your mind will increase significantly. You will not get 100% freedom because for that you'd have to stop being human. To be human is to have certain limits. But right now you are nowhere near the limits of what the human mind/body can do.
</p>

<p>
	Do not underestimate the power of the mind. The entire universe is mind-stuff. You just don't know how to access it. Humans are a very crude and underdeveloped species. And you are a very crude and underdeveloped human. So there's your answer.
</p>

So all your ideas and ideals fly out the window. You can tell yourself you're fearless but when the floor beneath your feet disappears, you'll be in for surprises you could not anticipate or prepare for.
</p>

<p>
	Faith and love are of course great things to bring into the trip. But you never know how twisting things will get. Sometimes a trip just goes hairy for no apparent reason beyond your ability to control it.
</p>

<p>
	If you trip long enough you will get some very hairy trips. The key is to go with the flow and for fucks sake never resist them. Surrender to the hairiness. That alone with grow you a lot.

<p>
	Yeah, that's why self-employment is so hard and most people just cannot do it. Because it takes serious vision and self-discipline to be able to lead yourself. Most people are sheep who suck on the tit of society. They need a boss just to tell them when to wake up, otherwise they would become vegetables.
</p>

<p>
	The self-determined life is not the easy life. The easy life is working at Starbucks for 40 years and then retiring without a single dream or deep thought about life.
</p>

<p>
	You need to have a serous over-arching vision and purpose to your life if you're gonna go it alone. You need to be a fuckin boss on yourself.

	Being a successful musician is not just about musical skills. You also need marketing and business skills.
</p>

<p>
	It may be necessary to keep your dentistry gig for now. But eventually if dentistry is not your passion but music is, you want to transition to place where your music can support you. That might take some years and some clever business scheming. You'd need to build a brand of some kind.

	I don't really know what that means.

<p>
	Stick to the core principles of course. Flashy game is bad game. The best game is chill, friendly, and so natural it doesn't look like game at all.
</p>

<p>
	Seek to be totally natural, congruent, authentic, and humble. Natural, chill, and authentic works like magic.
</p>

<p>
	When you boil game down to its essence you'll discover it's just you being you to the hilt. But it takes A LOT of experience to reach that point.

<p>
	Nothing is ever right or wrong. It's a question of who you wish to be. And the consequences of your actions.
</p>

<p>
	Think twice before pissing into the wind.

	Great work!
</p>

<p>
	Except you won't really die. There is no such thing as death. Only the idea of you will die. The real YOU is immortal.
</p>

<p>
	You will jump off the cliff to your death only to realize that the canyon has no floor.

<p>
	Yes, but even if you take weeks apart the trips will still get deeper and deeper and deeper.
</p>

<p>
	It will mindfuck you either way.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful what you wish for. You are not ready to see the Full Monty. You can never be ready. It's far too radical and shocking. It will suckerpunch you. It can easily traumatize you.

<p>
	Because God is the greatest thing you can be. And people flock to be near it like moths to a flame.

<p>
	Of course not. Rather you generate a loving vision of your future. You imagine your highest future and feel that feeling. Then you go build it.

<p>
	You can't escape McDonalds by feeling shitty. You escape McDonalds by feeling inspiring about what you will create next.

	Use positive feeling as your launch fuel. Negative feeling is the devil sucking out your soul.

<p>
	Look at what JP demonstrates, not what he says. He says to take responsibility but then he makes a career out of blaming others for the world's problems: feminists, marxists, leftists, hippies, liberal professors, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Scapegoating 101
</p>

<p>
	Weak men use JP to blame women for their lack of sex and lack of manhood.
</p>

<p>
	JP does not yet realize what it means to pick up the cross of God.

<p>
	It requires LOTS of mindfulness practice.
</p>

<p>
	Consider taking a 10 day Vipasanna retreat. That will open your eyes to the power of body awareness in a way that you cannot presently imagine.
</p>

<p>
	You could spend the next 10 years just sitting on a couch and feeling your body. And you'd still not feel everything there is to feel there. The body is a very complex and subtle organic technology. It's more intelligent than any Western science can imagine. Every cell in your body has its own innate intelligence.

<p>
	Yes, you can claim to be a religious organization. But in this case, the money is not technically yours, it's the organization's. You can't use it for personal expenses. You must use it for organization business. If you pay yourself a salary you will get taxed on that.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a non-profit organization.
</p>

<p>
	I could claim Actualized.org as a religious organization. Because that's what it basically is. "Religous" here just means spiritual.

<p>
	You are the creator. You define what worth is. Whatever you say it is, it is for you.
</p>

<p>
	If you say nothing about it, it does not exist because you did not create it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	In the absolute sense, all being has zero worth. Which is identical to it having infinite worth.

<title>To All Struggling Males: Stop Playing Victim!</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/34866-to-all-struggling-males-stop-playing-victim/?do=findComment&amp;comment=424506</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I see a chronic problem on this sub-forum, which is young males who complain about lack of success with women and failing to take responsibility for their situation.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 rule of all growth and personal development is taking 100% responsibility for your situation. I know how hard that can be when you're struggling with women/sex. It feels very much like life is treating you unfairly and that it's the women's fault. Let me tell you right now: this is a total ILLUSION! It's not the women. It's not society. It's not post-modernists. It's not the Marxists. It's not the feminists. It's YOU!
</p>

<p>
	This is not me blaming you. This is simply how all personal development works. Whatever problem you have in life you must begin by getting honest with yourself how you created it. Sometimes this is difficult to accept. It's much easier to blame someone else, or even blame yourself (for being too ugly or too short or too introverted). I am not suggesting you blame yourself. Rather, take ownership of the fact that you are the creator of your life. Whatever is missing in your life, you can correct, but only if you stop blaming yourself and others.
</p>

<p>
	Be very mindful of how your ego-mind creates narratives which justify your sense of lack, brokenness, or inability to attract women. All of these narratives, justification, rationalizations, logic, "facts", scientific studies, proofs, etc are sneakily fabricated by your own mind! Your own mind is the enemy! Watch it like a hawk. Your mind will try to come up with reasons and excuses for why your life is unfair and how success with women is impossible. This is all horseshit! Do not believe your own mind here. Your mind is clouded by fear, insecurity, and neediness. That is totally normal and understandable, but you cannot resolve your problems from such a place. From such a place your problems will get worse as you start to blame the world and solidify your victim worldview with cherry-picked evidence, "science", and "logic". Be extra suspicious of "logic" and "science" here. There is nothing logical or scientific about your victim attitude or lack of success with women. It's purely about meeting the survival needs of your ego. Sex is a very powerful survival need which will drive your mind towards all manner of mental gymnastics to ensure that you get it, or at least feel better for not getting it.
</p>

<p>
	There's good news and bad news. The good news is: Your looks are NOT the problem! The bad news is: your personality, attitude, and mindset are terrible! The good news is, it's possible to change that. The bad news is, it won't be easy and you will resist it like the devil that you are.
</p>

<p>
	So what's the solution? Take ownership of your problem and commit to resolving it. For this you need faith and confidence in your ability to self-actualize. You must have enough hope and vision to see yourself get much better with attracting women. This is NOT a pipe dream or fuzzy thinking. The reality is that any man can become 100x better at attracting women if he really takes ownership of the matter. Yes, it takes serious work. But it's also highly worth it. Imagine that within 3 years you're able to attract pretty women and feel confident about yourself when it comes to dating. Isn't that worth the effort? It sure is. This is not a fantasy. I've done it, many men have done it, and so can you! Your looks are NOT the bottleneck, your mindset is.
</p>

<p>
	So what do you do after you've established this vision? You must do lots of research to educate yourself about how dating actually work (not how you think it works). Find videos, find books, buy online courses, hire a coach, take a bootcamp, take a workshop, etc. There are literally hundreds of excellent resources available online these days. Most of them are legit, not scams. Study them hard and then get into the field. Start talking to women. Start approaching women. Start flirting with women. Start being much more social.
</p>

<p>
	If you struggle attracting women I can tell you right now what your top problems are. It's not lack of money, looks, muscles, car, height, or dick size. Remember, attraction and dating is EXTREMELY counter-intuitive. It's works exactly the opposite of how you initially think.
</p>

<p>
	Your top problems are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		You live in your mancave and never go out! You must go out into social spaces where real women hang out.
	</li>
	<li>
		You spend WAY too much time online, indoors
	</li>
	<li>
		You spend WAY too much time on Youtube, Netflix, and playing video games
	</li>
	<li>
		You work too much
	</li>
	<li>
		You are never around cute single women
	</li>
	<li>
		You never start conversations with strangers
	</li>
	<li>
		You have terrible body language due to lack of experience
	</li>
	<li>
		You are not comfortable doing small-talk and being emotional and random in conversations
	</li>
	<li>
		You are far too logical
	</li>
	<li>
		You approach zero women on a regular basis
	</li>
	<li>
		You are terrified of approaching a women who you find attractive, talking yourself out of every approach
	</li>
	<li>
		You have terrible eye contact, you don't smile, and you don't project your voice properly
	</li>
	<li>
		You are crippled by fear and tongue-tied
	</li>
	<li>
		You are unable to start and sustain an interesting conversation with a human being
	</li>
	<li>
		You are disconnected from your body, your heart, your feelings, your emotions
	</li>
	<li>
		You have terrible self-image issues. You hate yourself, you hate how you look, you judge yourself way too harshly. You judge yourself just as harshly as you judge women.
	</li>
	<li>
		You have a bad sense of dress style and you don't groom yourself well
	</li>
	<li>
		You have no experience with physically touching women in a non-creepy way. You don't know how to rapidly physically escalate on a women without creeping her out.
	</li>
	<li>
		You don't know how women think or what they truly value in a man
	</li>
	<li>
		You don't know how to flirt and be authentic
	</li>
	<li>
		You are trying to be masculine in all the wrong ways -- fake masculinity
	</li>
	<li>
		You are needy, needy, needy
	</li>
	<li>
		You are terribly inexperienced
	</li>
	<li>
		You have no sense of passion or purpose in life, which robs you of confidence and masculine vitality
	</li>
	<li>
		Your attitude sucks: you whine, complain, bitch, moan, blame, and are so negative
	</li>
	<li>
		You think you understand life, reality, and how attraction works -- you don't!
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	So work on fixing all of that before you go blaming women. All of the above can be deliberately worked on and fixed.
</p>

<p>
	You need to learn how to be a real man. Being a real man has nothing to do with big muscles, big dick, or a fast car. A real man is grounded on the INSIDE. It's ALL about inner game! You need to cultivate that confidence. It doesn't come naturally. You must build it!
</p>

<p>
	80% of getting good with women is just actually being much more social. You need to deliberately re-structure your life so that you're automatically being more social. So that you're going out every weekend. So that you're bumping into new people constantly. So that you're making new friends all the time. This kind of re-structuring is very doable. You just have to be willing to change your lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
	And stop watching or listening to any of the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Jordan Peterson, MGTOW, RedPill, Incel material/forums/reddit
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	All of that is cancer of the mind. It's reinforcing your victim mindset and robbing you of your ability to change yourself.
</p>

<p>
	I've been where you are. I know it's tough. But hang in there, hold your vision, have hope, get to work, and things will dramatically improve for you. You will become a new person by the end of this journey and you will be so proud of yourself. You will become a real man, not some whiny JP fanboy.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 thing a real man does is take 100% responsibility for all his problems. A real man NEVER blames anyone, and certainly not women or feminism. A real man is a feminist. A real man fearlessly works on himself.
</p>

<p>
	So start right there! Start by fixing that.
</p>

Society rewards tons of "alpha" men. You can find thousands of examples which will blow your narrative out of the water.
</p>

<p>
	The meta problem here is that your ego is just spinning whatever kind of narratives suits it. There is no truth in such mental activities. This is not deep understanding of reality, life, gender, or society. It's ego games.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is constantly interpreting the world in such a way that you see precisely what most serves your ego and reinforces your existing worldview, no matter how fictitious it happens to be. Notice this. And go meta. Stop playing the game at that low level.
</p>

A stage Green Christian is exactly that. Foaming at the mouth Christians are not true Christians, they are fakes. So the irony is that Obama is a truer Christian than most Republicans.
</p>

<p>
	Did Obama dumb himself down a bit? Perhaps. I mean politics requires some degree of manipulating one's public image. That can't be avoided entirely.

<p>
	You are creating all of reality and your so-called physical body. But you are not aware of how.
</p>

<p>
	The more aware you become, the more stuff about yourself you will be able to change. Certainly you can change all the stuff you listed. Growing a third arm might be out of your human capacities. But you as God are imagining both your arms into being. There are just certain limits to being in our present human forms. Something has to stay constant to ground this life of yours until death. After death the limits drop away.

<title>The Myth of &quot;We Create Our Reality&quot; (Updated!)</title>

<p>
	You are God! You create EVERYTHING!
</p>

<p>
	It's merely a question of how conscious are you that you do so.
</p>

<p>
	Creation is not a simplistic thing. There are many layers to it. So it's not as simple as you imagining a unicorn and it materializes into the air.
</p>

<p>
	But consider the possibility that even that might be possible if you were sufficiently conscious of all the layers.

<p>
	Should and shouldn't don't exist. You are free to do whatever you want. But conscious beings care about their environment in the same way they care about not poisoning their bodies.

<p>

<p>
	Yes, it's possible.
</p>

<p>
	But realize that in the ultimate sense you and them are one.
</p>

<p>
	Whoever you are talking to in life, whether aliens, angles, or humans, you're really just talking to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind that it <u><strong>is</strong></u> possible to get wisdom and guidance from "others". If the wisdom rings true, might as well follow it. Just be careful taking the words of "others" on blind faith. You need to validate the wisdom in your direct experience, as with any teacher or teaching. Your personal experience is the ultimate authority.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't get too dependent on "others". Stand on your own two legs.
</p>

<p>
	From Kim's POV it does not even matter if Trump is truthworthy. Even if Trump is the nicest guy in the world, in 2-6 years he will be out of office and Kim will have to deal with a new US administration which will want to overthrown him if an overthrow is easily possible without killing millions of people. So Kim's incentive is to be able to kill millions of people in order to survive.
</p>

<p>
	The North Koreans are not stupid. They are very selfish. So the last thing they'll do is undermine their own survival odds.
</p>

<p>
	Kim handing over his nukes is like Trump handing over his taxes. Lol. Trump says he doesn't mind handing over his taxes, but he never will. It's just a ploy.

You're overlooking something.
</p>

<p>
	Environment is a relative term defined against the human self.
</p>

<p>
	By neglecting the environment people are precisely failing to realize that environment and self are one. Because they are convinced that environment is something "other" which they don't need to care about as long as their body is cared for. But the body cannot be cared for without caring for the environment.
</p>

<p>
	Unity and holism is the highest truth. Anything short of that leads to pathology.

<title>Confusion about non-duality</title>

<p>
	I will soon shoot a video on all that.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's a bit tricky.
</p>

<p>
	Will can be exercised without moral judgment. For example, if a child is playing with Legos, the child can choose what she wants to build. Anything she builds is perfect. There is no right or wrong or best or worst thing to build. But she still exercises will. Will is creation itself! Will is what's deciding what will be created.
</p>

<p>
	Try not to look at it as good or bad. Creation is done for its own sake, not because something is lacking. The creator doesn't need anything, it's just creating for the sheer joy of creation. You can train to live your life in such a matter. Then you create but you're detached from your creation.

			Why was it that Zen practitioners 400 years ago could successfully attain enlightenment an THEY didn't have a prepaid smartphone nor access to the video "Being a Zen Devil."?

</blockquote>

<p>
	You ignore that many of them did not. In fact most Zen practitioners never fully awaken. The failure rate is very high.
</p>

<p>
	And you ignore that many of them, even after they awoke, were still devils who abused, molested, raped, and even killed. Zen monasteries waged entire wars against each other, slaughtering monks by the hundreds.
</p>

<p>
	Having a satori is just the start. It is not mastery by any means. And without good teachings devilry is pretty much guaranteed.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, teachings about enlightenment are not enlightenment. But they can still be very useful for keeping you on the right track. By saying little about enlightenment the teacher leaves a lot of room for misinterpretation and falling into traps. While enlightenment cannot be described well with words, the traps can be.

<p>
	Intuition is your HIGHEST feeling. It is the voice of your soul/spirit.
</p>

<p>
	And don't discount feelings either! Feelings are faithful indicators of how things really are for you. Listen to your feelings more, not less. The problem is that you repress and judge your feelings too much. This is what gets you into trouble.
</p>

<p>
	Feel your feelings without reacting to them or overthinking them. Just feel for the sake of feeling, not as a means to some end.
</p>

<p>
	Ego and militancy go hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest egos cause the most violence, suffering, and death.
</p>

<p>
	Because ego is always in fear it must lash out at others. Ego is fundamentally insecure about itself. And Trump is the most insecure president we've ever had. So it's bound to manifest in ugly ways.
</p>

<p>
	Enemies only exist from an ego's POV. A conscious person has no enemies.

</p>

<p>
	But either path is valid. Sometimes you gotta be foolish for many years to realize what wisdom is.
</p>

<p>
	Given Tyson's starting point, his path was just right, for him. I wouldn't recommend it for most people though. Too painful. It's like punching yourself in the nuts over and over again just to learn not to do that.

</p>

<p>
	But also stick around for more advanced theory. You still have much advanced stuff to learn. Vipassana lone will not be enough. There are many important things Vipassana will not teach you. This not a critique of Vipassana. It's just one tool within a much larger framework. All tools have their limits.

			Just like you can't expect any Republican to change his mind by learning new facts, don't expect any one else to change theirs. If Trump denuclearizes North Korea neither Leo nor any other person who is deeply buried by his opinion will change his / their view.

<p>
	Don't confuse my degree of openmindedness and self-reflection with that of Republican.
</p>

<p>
	I have no problem re-evaluating my positions and changing them. I've changed my positions and worldview more than you can imagine.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump denuclearizes North Korea, I will acknowledge it and my understanding of him will change. I will have to admit that I underestimated him.
</p>

<p>
	But I wouldn't bet on that happening. There's higher odds of him starting WWIII.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way North Korea will give up its nukes given the US's penchant for regime change. Kim would be suicidal to do so. If he gives up his nukes the US will want to bomb and overthrow him like in Iran, Iraq, and Libya.
</p>

<p>
	Think about it, if you were a dictator and you had nukes, why would you ever give them up? Having them means you will never get invaded. The US cannot invade North Korea because they would nuke South Korea. So counter-intuitively those nukes are maintaining peace.
</p>

<p>
	North Korea having nukes is not as big a problem as people make it out to be. They would never use them aggressively because they know it would be suicidal. If North Korea ever used a nuke first, they would be nuked by the US until there was nothing left of North Korea. And they know this. North Korean nukes cannot even reach most of the US. So they are severely overpowered by the US. So all that having a few nukes does for North Korea is provide a nice obstacle to US invasion.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that the US is the aggressor, not North Korea. North Korea is practicing self-defense. Which is totally expected. What else can they do? They have to maintain their regime as any ego would do.
</p>

<p>
	I'm always open to being proven wrong. The above position is not ideological dogma. It's just my best analysis of the situation. Of course my analysis can be disproven in the future. You can't do better than your best analysis at any given point in time. Political analysis is never Absolute, it's probabilistic given so many unknown variables.
</p>

<title>Nothing is impossible?</title>

<p>
	God is both beyond it, but also IT.
</p>

<p>
	Who created possible and impossible? God!
</p>

<p>
	Anything which you can think of or experience is a creation. It had to be created or there would be nothing there. So if it was created, who created it? God/You did!
</p>

<p>
	And who created God? God created itself of course! How can God do that? Because God hasn't yet created possible or impossible, so it wasn't limited in any way. So it could do crazy mind-bending stuff like creating itself. That's what unlimitedness allows. It's TOTAL FREEDOM! A lack of all boundaries, definitions, or rules.
</p>

<p>
	God is not bound by rules because the rules had to be created by it. God is prior to all rules, but at the same time, God is all the rules! Because God is inseparable from its creation. Whatever God creates, it is being. God's creation is God's body, so to speak. Without this "body" God exists as pure formlessness. God's body is the whole universe. God's body is constantly morphing and changing, creating the illusion of movement and life.
</p>

	The forum software is very complex and it cannot simply be modified at will. It is what is it and we have little control over it.

<p>
	That is God being God.
</p>

<p>
	Everything, anything, and nothing is God being God. There is nowhere for God to disappear to because God is already nowhere and encompasses both appearance and disappearance.

<p>
	God has no opposite. Absolutes cannot have an opposite. That's what an Absolute is.

			I am here to develop myself, not get involved in researching each party and consequences each party might have on world, hoping that one day we will have enough people who know what they are doing and my vote will matter, if I will involve myself in each endeavor where I can make some effect I will have no time left to do what is more important and ultimately has more impacts on humanity as whole.

<p>
	Yes, that's is the myopia of your current level of development. As you develop higher you will reach a point where you will realize the deep interconnectedness of yourself and your community. And then such a dualistic attitude as you now hold will become untenable.
</p>

<p>
	There is still a fundamental selfishness to your position.
</p>

<p>
	To neglect your community is to neglect yourself, since you and other are one.
</p>

<p>
	But do as you like. I am not judging you, just making a prediction about where you growth can take you.
</p>

<p>
	I see that many of you folks here need a serious education in the connection between spirituality and politics. Spiritual work alone is not enough to make one politically wise. Especially not with the traditional non-integral spiritual schools like Zen, Vedanta, etc. This is a major spiritual pathology: neglecting ecological concerns for personal salvation. It's about as selfish as eating all the food on the life-raft while others are looking the other way.

<title>Questions about &quot;The Power Of Asking Questions&quot;</title>

The only question is whether you are creating consciously or unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
	To refuse the call of taking ownership of your godly creative capacity is a creation you create. If you choose to sit in your Mom's basement your whole life eating Cheetos and jerking off to anime, that's what you as God created. But you did so not aware that you could have created something else. And so in effect you created a devil of yourself.
