<p>
	That's like saying, what if a man and woman are the exactly same thing, expect the man has a dick.
</p>

<p>
	That's a pretty important difference.
</p>

<p>
	The awakened person realizes he is God. The derealized person does not.
</p>

<p>
	There is no glass between the awakened person and the world, the awakened person IS the whole world. And the awakened person has surrendered to it.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes it is. You just don't properly understand what survival is.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is NOT survival of the body or the species. Survival is about survival of the ego-mind. If you are an incel, THAT is what's being survived. The fact that you never gets laid is a plus in that case because it allows you to maintain an identity as an incel.
</p>

<p>
	The root reason why incels are incels is because they are too scared to let the incel part of them die. Which is what's necessary to get laid.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why incels spend so much time creating ideologies about how they are victims and how unfair life is and how bad women are. Without that ideology incels would die.
</p>

<p>
	That is definitely their goal.
</p>

<p>
	Once you have a monopoly you can jack up prices without fear of losing customers. That's the gameplan of every giant business.

</blockquote>

<p>
	A higher consciousness approach does not work on very low consciousness people.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you cannot play nice with a rabid dog. The dog needs to be restrained physically and kept at a safe distance.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise you cannot reason with someone like Hitler, you can only execute him.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise you cannot reason with today's Trumpist Republicans, you can only show the public how shameless they are and kick them out of office for a better set of people.
</p>

<p>
	Once a human starts to act like a monster, the best way to solve that problem is by showing the entire town his monstrous behavior. So they can know the truth and stop supporting him. So when Republicans cut healthcare, show that. When they act like bigots, show that. Show it all so the people can see how ugly it is.

</p>

<p>
	In some parts of the world this is still the case.
</p>

<p>
	This happens at a cultural level not only in gross ways but in many subtle ways. So even if in many cultures today women are allowed to have some independence, they are still often treated by men in power as pawns for their own gratification.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing new or surprising about this. A low consciousness ego will use everything around it as a pawn to further its survival regardless of the suffering inflicted on the pawn.

<p>
	Definitely not.
</p>

<p>
	All someones are products of imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Imagination does not belong to anyone nor does it take place via any physical mechanism. Imagination is grounded in nothing.
</p>

<p>
	How could there be a someone unless it was first imagined? There can't. Nothing can exist until it is imagined, because existence is none other than imagination. There cannot be anything outside of imagination because imagination is absolutely infinite.

<p>
	You are conflating absolute and relative truths.
</p>

<p>
	Realizing that the materialistic worldview is imaginary is crucial for awakening to Truth.
</p>

<p>
	And at a practical level the materialist paradigm seriously hinders scientific advancement.

<p>
	Clinical trials clearly show that you can increase the rate of fighting and healing cancer with visualization exercises in which you visualize your immune system killing the cancer cells. This is an effective technique that is supported by clinical data. People recover from illness faster when they visualize than when they don't.
</p>

<p>
	So in this sense you do have control of your immune system. Not to mention that you can control what you feed your body which greatly affects your immune system's ability to function.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the notion of "control" here is dualistic and relative. In the absolute sense the Universe controls itself.

<p>
	All difference is relative and imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	But survival is still ongoing. There is a difference relative to survival. Survival is a relative and imaginary activity. Yet if you don't do it, you can't be here to talk about. Every living being is stuck in this existential bind and the only escape is death or awakening.

<p>
	Pete is white Obama, with less experience.
</p>

<p>
	It's time to move beyond Obama's politics. It was okay in the post-Bush era, but new ideas are needed. Obama proved that the Republicans will not be reasoned with and they will not compromise. And that problem has only gotten worse. The only solution is to shame them out of office, which Bernie can do.

<p>
	Isness is.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is.
</p>

<p>
	You could say that is the observer. Just as long as you understand the observer and the observed are identical, and the observer exists but has no from or quality whatsoever.
</p>

<p>
	You could also say the observer is God. And God is nothing. But it is a nothing which exists.

<title>Explicit vs Implicit Understanding</title>

<p>
	It's easy to see that the mind is infinite simply because the mind can think an infinite number of different thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	The only limit is your lifespan. But even that is a thought-based limitation.
</p>

<p>
	It's infinite not because of nanotubes. It's infinite because you are God.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You're not getting it. Women's brains are genetically hardwired to be more intuitive.
</p>

<p>
	The male brain is less integrated and holistic than a female brain. The male brain is more autistic and left-hemisphere dominant while the female brain is more balanced, giving her access to more intuitive capacity of the right-hemisphere.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are exceptions. I'm speaking generally.
</p>

<p>
	This is one of reasons why witches are classically women. Women are not only more intuitive, they often have psychic abilities which is why women are more interested in stuff like astrology and psychic stuff. Of course not all women have psychic abilities, but I think a larger percentage of them do than men.
</p>

<p>
	This is not about teaching it to their sons.

<title>This Is Why Men Have Less SΕX Than Women</title>

<p>
	To be more helpful to you, women generally have less problems with being incels simply because women are more social creatures. These days it's all too easy for a man to lock himself in his mancave and spend most of his time online or playing video games. You just can't get laid that way. If you invested as much time into being social as you did into playing video games or hanging around online, you'd get laid way more.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 biggest thing you can do to increase your sex is to be social.
</p>

<p>
	It's that simple. But it requires you make structural changes to your way of life. Which of course no one wants to do.
</p>

<p>
	Try it. Make a goal to talk to 10 new people every day for 90 days. You'll be amazed at the opportunities that come your way. Not just sex but jobs, ideas, friendships, etc. Being social takes effort for many people, especially guys and introverts.
</p>

<p>
	If you're an introverted guy who spends all his time online, you will basically never get laid. So change that.
</p>

<p>
	Tesla had extraordinary visualization abilities.
</p>

<p>
	Tesla seemed like an abnormally conscious individual just by default. He was probably in a higher state of consciousness than most humans on a regular basis, even without special techniques.
</p>

<p>
	If you just go into solitude for days at a time without distraction, you can become very creative. No special techniques necessary. But you could also practice visualization techniques and train your focus. I get most creative on my solo meditation retreats. Tesla was very solitary and focused, so you might say he spent most of his life in a solo retreat.
</p>

<p>
	And of course there's psychedelics. Nothing will super-charge your mind like a psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	You manifest faster at higher consciousness because the limits of material reality literally melt away -- since "physical reality" is nothing more than a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	But in general don't think that you can emulate Tesla. He was a unique genius. You ain't him. Focus on being more you.
</p>

<p>
	When you get a serious disorder that traditional medicine cannot cure, you'll turn to alternative treatments too.
</p>

<p>
	You don't appreciate how serious these issues can be and how many disorders traditional medicine only makes worse.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to take your health for granted when you're young and it comes effortlessly to you.

<p>
	It can be clear without being explicit.
</p>

<p>
	Implicit does not mean to act like a selfish ass without taking into account her desire and agenda.
</p>

<p>
	It's very clear if a women is interested in having sex with you. It doesn't need to be spelled out.

<p>
	He is basically Bill Clinton again. He is not going to fight the corporatists hard like Bernie will.

<p>
	There is no magic external cure for awakening. You must sit your ass down and gaze inwards for long periods of time, in silence, without gimmickry. The ego mind loves gimmickry.

	You can download videos and sort them into two folders, New and Watched.
</p>

<p>
	There are probably also plugins for your web browser that let you add notes to a URL.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could even bookmark every watched video into its own Watched folder.

<p>
	What's not appreciated is that elections are messy. They never get 100% of the vote accurate. There is always some margin of error. This is compounded in caucauses because they are so messy and people-centered. This is not a computer chip lab. This is ordinary people behaving like herd animals. Yes, stuff will go wrong. Flipping a coin properly is not as easy as it seems if you've never done it before. You can flip a coin, it flys out of your hand, rolls on the floor, gets lodged sideways in a crack, and then what do you do??
</p>

<p>
	That is not rigging. That's just the system we got.
</p>

<p>
	Improvements to the system are also not easy to make. People yell about how flipping coins is so old fashioned and outdated, yet when they upgrade the system to be electronic and use apps, even more stuff goes wrong.
</p>

<p>
	You can't please someone who sits on a couch and righteously demands perfection.
</p>

<p>
	Go try to run a local election. See how challenging it is organize. See how many mistakes you make.
</p>

<p>
	Go try to build an app without bugs. See how far you get.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to bitch about stuff when you have zero experience building it. Building complex systems is always far more challenging than it seems.

<p>
	There is something in between panic and apathy.
</p>

<p>
	Panic is not as effective as consciousness. Panic tends to compound the problem.

<p>
	What you really mean to say is that we should be highly conscious and responsible.

			I've thought about this quite a bit the last month. And of course there is many layers to the symbolism of Christ and the crucifiction. But for me it represents the people and environment around "you". You let the environment and the people in your presence kill you. You interract with the world and it will destroy your sense of self. This can come of as so incredibly vicious and cruel at times that you start questioning how God can do this to you. You feel abandoned and violated but you still in your last ounce of faith trust the process and reality. Then you die. Then the resurrection happens.

<p>
	He will not enact ALL of his policies, nor is that necessary for success.

	America is inching towards Green every day in many ways all the time, even under Trump. You can't stop evolution. But with Bernie the evolution will happen faster and less people will suffer.

<p>
	Just don't forget that homeostasis is a double-edged sword that cuts both ways.
</p>

<p>
	Right now the status quo is what's keeping Trump from going full dictator.
</p>

<p>
	The status quo is not all bad, which is precisely why it's so powerful. It's powerful because its effective at getting you all of the current benefits you get.
</p>

<p>
	The status quo is what keeps you from being enslaved, cheated, raped, killed, etc.

<p>
	First of all, you have no idea if he actually murdered people. It's easy to smear innocent people as "terrorists" with no trial or proof. The USA labels innocent people are "terrorists" all the time. It's all too convenient.

<p>
	Secondly, even if he murdered people, he is still human and he is still God.

For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not the tax collectors also do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing that is remarkable? Do not the Gentiles also do the same? Therefore you be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect."

<p>
	They are part of the election.
</p>

<p>
	There are two elections:
</p>

<p>
	1) To pick who will be the one person to face off against Trump
</p>

<p>
	2) That person vs Trump
</p>

<p>
	It's very important to pick the best person to face Trump. Picking Hilary Clinton last time was what got Trump elected. If we pick a good person Trump should be easy to beat.

<p>
	Be careful with such justifications. You should be much more skeptical of any time anyone is called "a terrorist". This is one of the most abused labels and a tool of devilry.
</p>

<p>
	"A terrorist" is a human and a human is God.
</p>

<p>
	"Terrorism" is a relative notion. One nation's terrorist is another nation's hero.

<title>Example Of Going Against One's Team</title>

<p>
	This is a great example of challenging herd mentality and ideology. Imagine how challenging this was for his mind to do.
</p>

<p>
	It's great to see a handful of conservatives with integrity and courage.
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJJUc8K4LNA?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	It's important to remember that there ARE decent conservatives out there. They aren't all MAGA.
</p>

<p>
	It's problematic to hold the stereotype that all conservatives are bad or irredeemable. Always remember that there is no such thing as "a conservative". There is diversity within such broad categories.
</p>

<p>
	One of the dangers of the Trump phenomenon is that many decent conservatives are not given a voice. After Trump is gone it's important that there be a rebuilding of the conservative party into something with more integrity, because roughly half the country leans conservative and you will never get them to all become liberals. So either there will be a healthy expression of conservativism or an unhealthy one.
</p>

<p>
	It is in the best interest of Bernie supporters to understand this and support healthy expressions of conservativism. Because the alternative would be worse.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't have to be that way.
</p>

<p>
	You can build high quality relationships.
</p>

<p>
	No one is forcing you to do one night stands.
</p>

<p>
	And also understand that many women are into one night stands. Women who go to a nightclub are interested in sex. They are not there to play pattycakes.
</p>

<p>
	I met two gals who flew into Vegas with the desire to have sex with new guys every day of the week while they were here. After I slept with one of them, she didn't even want to see me the next day. She went looking for a new guy.
</p>

<p>
	Women are not such innocent creatures.
</p>

<p>
	And not all sex requires some deep commitment. I've had sex with women and then we both happily go our separate ways with no hard feelings.
</p>

			The absolute is merely hiding from itself in an illusion of seperateness. This is the absolute. If the absolute is the absolute how can it ever not be fully the absolute? How can there be a "you" that has the possibility of becoming the absolute, that isn't that already? Wouldn't that suggest that the absolute isn't absolute?

<p>
	Everything is the Absolute but there are many levels of being conscious of what the Absolute is.

<p>
	An ant is the Absolute but has very little consciousness of that fact due to its incarnation in that finite body. So the body one inhabits matters.

	Since you are hinged to the human body, for now, that imposes serious limits on your consciousness. Your consciousness can go infinite, but not so infinite that you lose your human form.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully became the Absolute you would cease having any form whatsoever and you would be all form. Then you couldn't be here asking these human questions.

<p>
	Yes, addition and subtraction are not possible from the Absolute perspective.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, there is no difference what you add or subtract because without self-bias it doesn't matter what is added or subtracted or neither since everything has equal value.
</p>

<p>
	What meaning can adding or subtracting money to your bank account have if a positive balance has equal value to a negative balance in your mind?
</p>

<p>
	Value itself is a product of self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	What is the value of the whole Universe?

	Of course it will feel unnatural at first. You keep practicing it until you can stare and talk at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	The nice thing about deep eye contact is that it's so powerful that much less needs to be said.
</p>

<p>
	I would focus less on being a chatterbox and more on transmitting seductive and sexual energy through your gaze.
</p>

<p>
	Also, slow down the rate of your speech. Slow and steady.

<p>
	I don't think the debates will matter at all. Trump is not going to gain any more supporters and he will not lose any current supporters either. So all a debate will do is entrench both sides.
</p>

<p>
	Trump may even refuse to do a debate. Although it might be too tempting for his ego to stay away from the spectacle.
</p>

<p>
	If spirituality is taking you away from actuality, you're doing it backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe trying pursuing actuality and you will find yourself being spiritual.

<title>What are some ways to deal with anger?</title>

<p>
	As soon as you feel anger, get directly underneath it by asking the question, "How have I been hurt here?"
</p>

<p>
	The anger is a false mask for hurt. Become conscious of the hurt and sit with it. Allow yourself to feel hurt.
</p>

<p>
	The crucial mistake is trying to be invulnerable. Be vulnerable. That is what's true. All finite forms are vulnerable.
</p>
