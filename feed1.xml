	Don't disparage knowledge. Knowledge is the first step, and it is an important step. But of course it is only the beginning. Proper knowledge will save your ass many times in the future.

<title>Anxious about teachings of MGTOW...</title>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15659-santerton/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="15659" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15659-santerton/" rel="">@santerton</a> For fucks sake, STOP WATCHING MGTOW. Period.
</p>

<p>
	And never visit 4chan ever again in your life.
</p>

<p>
	It's all toxic, dogmatic, egotistical, unconscious, devilsh garbage.
</p>

<p>
	It is not even worth debunking or arguing against. It's so false and wrong it's hopeless.
</p>

<p>
	MGTOW, RedPill, and Incels are the American equivalent of Al Qaeda Islamist radicalism. By ingesting their videos and discussions your mind is getting programmed with that mind-virus. That happens because as you watch and listen, it appeals to your desperate needy ego. Triggering all of your worst fears, hates, insecurities, and victim mentality.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get better with women, you can do so and have amazing loving sexy relationships. But it will take self-improvement and spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	Dating coaches are not liars. Dating coaches can teach you how to get really good with attracting women. I have interacted with dozens of dating coaches and their advice is top-notch for attraction. Not so good for relationships. For solid relationships you will need a more spiritual approach which you can layer on top of the attraction advice.
</p>

<p>
	Once you become spiritual and consciousness enough, sex will not even be important to you any more. You will be so deeply happy without sex that chasing women will be a joke.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is 1000x more enjoyable than any sex you will ever have. With that said, you can do both.
</p>

<p>
	Here's the practical solution for you: Stop sitting in your Mom's basement browsing toxic forums, and GO OUT and talk to real females. You will never get laid by sitting at home. It is not physically possible.
</p>

<p>
	See how simple the solution is? Yet you refuse to do it. Because it takes emotional labor to face your fears and grow yourself. You much prefer to sit at home and rant against how bad women are and how nothing can change.
</p>

<p>
	Rule #1 of all personal development: You must take 100% responsibility for your life, your beliefs, your feelings, your situation. No one is to blame.
</p>

<p>
	MGTOW is not a teaching. It's egotical, reactionary rantings driven by fear, hate, insecurity, selfishness, woundedness, and neediness. It's very similar to Hitler's rants against the Jews and communists.
</p>

<title>Is Sex a Need or a Desire?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/34615-is-sex-a-need-or-a-desire/?do=findComment&amp;comment=419147</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Need/desire is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	You are the one defining them. Whatever you say is a need becomes a need.
</p>

<p>
	Strictly speaking there is no need to do anything. You could just lay down and die. There is not even a need to live.
</p>

<p>
	Practically speaking, sex is one of the most powerful human drives. Good luck ignoring it. It's designed to be unignorable.
</p>

<p>
	By saying that sex is a need all we're saying is: it's a core biological drive which dominates human survival. It can be overcome, but not easily, and not through something as simplistic as NoFap. You might as well be practicing NoShit.
</p>

<title>MDMA Psychotherapy vs Regular Psychotherapy</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13755-patrick-lynam/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13755" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13755-patrick-lynam/" rel="">@Patrick Lynam</a> I'm not really sure anyone offers MDMA assisted therapy since MDMA is illegal in most countries and a serious therapist would not want to risk it.
</p>

<p>
	You can either do psychedelics on your own and that itself is the therapy.
</p>

<p>
	Or you can consider doing psychedelics with a shaman like with Ayahuasca or toad venom or ibogaine clinics in Costa Rica, Canada, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Traditional talk therapy certainly works, but nothing compares to the therapeutic power of psychedelics. You don't need a therapist to administer it. The psychedelic is 100x wiser than any silly therapist. The therapist is more of a distraction than of help during a trip. The psychedelic will show you everything you need to know about yourself and your issues if you come to it with a genuine intention. All that's required is that you want to know the TRUTH about your issue. That's all. The psychedelic will show you all the answers, as much as you're willing to stomach.
</p>

<p>
	Just make sure you follow a proper tripping protocol. And start with small doses.
</p>

<p>
	It's very smart to take charge of your own mental and psychological issues. No one can really sort you out but you. Which is why traditional talk therapy is so gradual. The answers are all inside you, if you'd only sit down with a notepad and introspect.
</p>

<p>
	You can teach yourself how to diagnose and troubleshoot all of your own psychological problems.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you have the cash to burn, talk therapy could be good too. But you can't just rely on talk therapy to fix your life. Your life will require a lot deeper work to truly sort out. No talk therapist even understands how deep this work goes. So it's worth your time to learn how to self-help.
</p>

<title>How to stop panicking in altered states of consciousness?</title>

<p>
	If at first you don't succeed, try try again.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that simple. You try stuff until you improve and master it.
</p>

<p>
	Never judge your progress by a couple of attempts. It takes many attempts before you learn to surrender.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes it takes 50 attempts. Sometimes 100 attempts. This is how mastery is done. See my old video called: Mastery
</p>

<p>
	Shamanic breathing is not so hard. You can probably get good at it in 10-20 attempts.

<title>Is realizing God the most 'valuable' thing I can do?</title>

</p>

<p>
	The soul only has one function and desire: full realization and embodiment of God. That's all it wants and the only thing it is after. Everything else is scenery along the way.
</p>

<p>
	This is all that life is about. There is nothing else.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just about joy, there is literally nothing else to do but stall it out and deny it, or do it.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of vision and wisdom to actually do it though. Talking about it is all too easy. You have to get very clear that this is what you want.
</p>

	You are expecting too much. It's too early for that yet.
</p>

<p>
	Be happy with mid to high Green politicians.
</p>

<p>
	Politics is a very pragmatic sport. You can't be too idealistic about it. It's not about perfection, it's about gradual incremental improvements. The best you can get is the best you can get.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, society is still pretty damn good in America or Europe. Compared to how society was 500 years ago.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The ego-mind returns surprisingly soon. Like within 30 minutes you're back into standard ego operating mode. But of course shaken to your core. It's often a relief to return to ordinary life. But there is also a deep regret for losing that full-on God-consciousness because nothing in life will ever top that.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes the God-consciousness lingers for a few hours or even into the next day.
</p>

<p>
	The saddest part about 5-MeO is that you cannot be that high 24/7/365. Losing touch with God is one of the deepest pains. But as you awaken more, you will start to realize that God is present all the time, even if you're not on a peak. This takes a lot of tripping to start to realize.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is right here, right now, at all times. But only if you're awake enough to see it. It does zero good telling an unawakened newbie that enlightenment is right here, right now, at all times. He just cannot see it. He needs actual breakthroughs and mystical experiences to demonstrate it to himself. That's where the 5-MeO comes in so handy.
</p>

<p>
	After enough tripping, your whole life will start to feel like a trip. The materialist paradigm slowly gets snuffed out forever. I no longer experience myself as in a material world. The world gradually becomes self-luminous.
</p>

<p>
	Weed definitely can raise consciousness. It's been used by yogis in India for this purpose for thousands of years.
</p>

<p>
	Of course most people use it irresponsibly, just like they do with food, drink, sex, and pretty much everything else. Blame the user not the substance.
</p>

<p>
	It takes great care to use substances for spiritual growth. It's not for kids and fools.

	Seperation is illusion.

<p>
	Look at your hand. There are 5 fingers, but all the fingers are part of one hand. You are like one of those fingers which isn't realizing that it's also the entire hand. There is no boundary between a finger and a hand. Finger and hand ONE thing!
</p>

<p>
	Now apply this logic to the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	The one giant Mind has an infinite number of virtual partitions, of which your ego-mind is one.

<title>How do I get rid of “unhealthy manifestations” of Spiral Dynamics stage Yellow?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Your heart is still closed. You still do not realize what Love is.
</p>

<p>
	Once you do that, it will soften you, and you will discover what life is really about, what God is really about.
</p>

<p>
	Intellect without Love is a barren desert.
</p>

<p>
	To transcend Yellow requires the greatest leap of all into the realm of the Absolute. You must have many mystical experiences which ultimately lead to the realization of God.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	So I was basically quoting that. Personally I have not been to see it for myself.
</p>

<p>
	Generally-speaking Northern Europe is starting to dip their toes into Yellow. But it's still very early. There are no solid Yellow governments yet. But they will probably emerge first in Northern Europe.
</p>

<p>
	This is rather technical stuff which requires some deep reading. It cannot be philosophized about casually.

<p>
	Yes, you are permanently changed. But the ego still returns. It's just more purified.
</p>

<p>
	The change is subtle but significant. Especially after a dozen trips. Those incremental changes add up to more than the sum of their parts.
</p>

<p>
	Basically it's no different than how it works with meditation retreats. One retreat will never totally change you. But the retreats add up over the years to something significant.

<p>
	There is Goodness as an Absolute. It's what you would do if you were totally selfless and unconditionally loving. It's literally what God is doing to design this whole show. It is a Good which has no opposite.
</p>

<p>
	What you can do if fully align your agenda with that of God. Then your will becomes God's Will. This would be the ultimate way to live, but right now it is totally out of your reality. First you must realize what God is.

<p>
	Psychedelics help you discover yourself. And since the Self is all that exists, through that you can discover anything of importance.

			You can abolish private property in a way by realizing that it is an illusion. But, the illusion seems practical.
		</p>

		<p>
			On paper, I own a house in an apartment, but I don't feel that I own it. It takes only a few big mistakes to lose it. Ownership is an illusion but still practical. Even a low-consciousness person perceives the illusion of house ownership. When ownership is fragile, you realize its illusory nature. On paper, you own a house. In reality, you don't own a shit. You don't really own the money in your bank account, either. The government can lock your bank account any time. Maybe, not your bitcoin wallet.
		</p>

		<p>
			To me, ownership and various economic concepts are just a game. But, it's a game that can make you go through a lot of pain.

<p>
	I mean abolishing private property in practice. So for example, if you start a business, the government will own it. If you buy a house, your local town/village will own a majority stake in it. That's true communism. And no one is seriously advocating for it.

<p>
	Perception, thought, and creation are not two.
</p>

<p>
	The universe is hell for devils because of how they perceive and how they think -- which is their creation.
</p>

<p>
	How you think about reality affects reality directly. By thinking of the world as a place where you exist, where others can harm you, and where one day you will die, you literally create your own hell.

</p>

<p>
	The leap from Stage Red to Blue was a major leap in human evolution.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is comparing to some hippie ideal spirituality, which is stage Green, which never existed until 100 years ago, and only on the shoulders of Blue.

<p>
	If anyone can find some links to the donation campaigns in Oregon and California, please post them here.
</p>

<p>
	Then I will post them on my blog for all to see.
</p>

<p>
	I wish I had known about this Denver campaign earlier so I could promote it.

<p>
	Jesus did not leave a shitstorm. He spread the word about God as best as he could in his era.
</p>

<p>
	You have to remember that people were basically barbarians and slaves back then. So for them, Christianity was cutting edge high tech stuff, like the iPhone of their time.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that 99% of people could not read back then. And there were no books!
</p>

<p>
	Also, stop taking the word "devil" literally. These are nuanced teachings which require a highly intuitive and figurative mind to properly decipher.
</p>

<p>
	See, this is what I mean by combining spirituality and politics.
</p>

<p>
	This is how society self-actualizes at the collective level.
</p>

<p>
	Conscious and engaged citizenry produces a better society.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe it's time to donate some coin to the Oregon campaign. They have a good shot at passing it with all those hippie Oregonians.

<p>
	Yes, but Green is still not thinking about it systemically. Green is mostly doing it from her heart. That's all great, but it is not the kind of full-bore systemic thinking I described.
</p>

<p>
	Green is still looking at the situation from a personal agenda level, it just so happens that saving the Earth is now part of her personal agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Yellow and above is more impersonal. And yet still very personal! Tier 2 is more detached.

	I don't hate Orange. It's just limited.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I'm no fan of dogmatic Muslims. They can be extremely annoying.
</p>

<p>
	Blindly being right doesn't count for much. An atheist is still more developed than a Blue Muslim.
</p>

<p>
	We need more Green Muslims.

</p>

<p>
	It is critical in this work to stand on your own two feet. You must become totally self-guiding in the end, otherwise you have not realized your full Godhood. As God you can have no one to hold your hand. You must become your own authority.
</p>

<p>
	For this reason I do not agree with the path of devotion. To me it is not the highest path. It still has that subtle duality of me vs my guru. That must collapse.
</p>

<p>
	There is only one thing in the universe: YOU!
</p>

<p>
	It feels very good to not need any gurus. You take full ownership of your creation. Of course you can still learn from people. I learn from 100s of sources. I just keep a professional distance. I don't try to crawl up their holy ass hole.

<p>
	I don't like his approach. It's far too simplistic, black and white, and non-integral. It does not recognize that people are at very different stages of development. For a stage Red person, belief in Christ can be a positive life transforming event which moves him up to Blue, and it is legit spirituality, just not the highest level of nondual awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Nor do I think he has realized the deepest level of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Mindlessly destroying all beliefs not going to cut it. 
</p>

<p>
	I would much rather you follow Sadhguru than that guy.

<p>
	Just consider this: if humanity does not take climate change seriously over the next 20 years, there will be massive Purple, Red, and Blue casualities. Tens of millions of people will die, not to mention the irreversible environmental damage.

<p>
	Meanwhile JP is bitching about post-modernism.

<p>

<p>
	How many times do I have to say that LP is not a selfish thing, it is the highest form of love and service to the world!
</p>

<p>
	You are turning a beautiful thing into a tool of the devil.
</p>

<p>
	You must align your purpose with the good of the world.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming a politician is not at all necessary to help the world. There are literally millions of opportunities to help the world every year. You just have to open your eyes and see how everything is interconnected.

	God created relationship so that the depth of your love could really be put to the test. It's easy to love the world when you're sitting alone in a cave because there are no fools or devils to deal with.
</p>

<p>
	Try being enlightened while running for president. Now there's a real test of your consciousness!
</p>

<p>
	Osho was an enlightened master, but his community was full of devilry.

<p>
	Sure, that's a possible path.
</p>

<p>
	But what I teach with Actualized.org is a DIY approach to life and spirituality. Be your own guru sorta thing. That's my bias.
</p>

<p>
	Do whatever you want. You will anyway.

<p>
	Everyone who is not conscious of what reality is, who he is, what God is, and how the mind works, is a devil.
</p>

<p>
	As long as you realize the above, hold whatever opinions you want.
</p>

<p>
	There are also many degrees of devilry. So it's not all the same. Most people are minor devils. A few are big fat devils, like Trump. When people have a big following, like JP, they will get more push back for their devilry because it has the potential to create many minor devils out of the sheep.
</p>

<p>
	The converse is also true. Angels who gather big followings will also get enormous push back because they will disturb the devil's plans. A big angel is of greater threat to society than the biggest fattest devils. Devils can mostly tolerate their own. What they cannot tolerate is brightly glowing angels.

Society can only function when its citizens are well-educated and conscious. If the most conscious people stick their head in the sand and only focus on making their own personal lives work consciously, then society will be seized by the most unconscious right-wing nationalist tyrants. That's how Hitler and WWII happens.
</p>

<p>
	As a human being you have to take responsibility for your role within a collective. Personal enlightenment is good but not good enough! Which is why enlightened masters become Bodhisattvas, to help elevate the rest of mankind. They are playing  a much bigger game than their own personal enlightenment. Personal enlightenment is a cake walk compared to enlightening society.
</p>

<p>
	If you are the whole universe, then you are also society. You cannot treat yourself as only an individual unit, only a personal human life. You are also the collective! The life of all beings is your responsibility. You are God after all. How can you neglect your creation? Are you really going to sit by and watch devilry prevail? No! You cannot. It is actually impossible. Love and consciousness will move you to towards the highest Good.
</p>

<p>
	To be fully conscious is to take responsibility for EVERYTHING to the point where you are willing to lay your life down for the greater Good. That is literally God's work. God did not design this wondrous creation through negligence or selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	No, there is politics at every stage of the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	By being ignorant of politics and world events you are putting yourself into the worst possible position and dooming society to remain unconscious.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot avoid politics any more than you can avoid metaphysics. You're already doing it. The only question is, how conscious is your politics?
</p>

<p>
	Sticking your head in the sand is precisely why our politics is so ugly.

<title>Can right wing politics even be high cosciousness</title>

</p>

<p>
	But when the left-wing gets totally out of hand, then right-wing politics will have some value.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if true communists take over the government and call for totally abolishing private property, then right-wing ideas will be an important countervailing force to bring things back into balance. But we are nowhere close to that yet in America. We basically have zero truly communist political leaders here. Not sure about how things are in Finland.
</p>

<p>
	The right-wing loves to portray moderate Democratic socialists like Bernie Sanders as radical communists. But that's just their fear reaction, not reality. Hell, they called Obama a Muslim socialist, LOL!
</p>

<p>
	People don't appreciate what true socialism is: it's the abolition of all private means of production. Almost not country has that and almost no leader calls for that. Because it's not practical. Even China and North Korea don't have true socialism.
</p>

<p>
	A highly conscious person will not be right-wing, but she will also be wary of the excesses and dogmas of the left-wing. Left-wing is predominately stage Green, and stage Green definitely has some important blind spots and limitations. You cannot have stage Green run amok without any countervailing force or there will be problems. But the right-wing tends to over-exaggerate this threat.
</p>

<p>
	Very good. That is a first small step.
</p>

<p>
	There will be many more steps in your journey. Hang in there and keep going deeper.

<p>
	Feeling low will pass. Keep your eye on the big picture.
</p>

<p>
	And don't forget to be kind to yourself and love yourself. Acknowledge the enormous progress you've made. Try to enjoy this whole process. Don't turn it into a grind or an obligation. Pursue Truth/Love/Consciousness joyfully!

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	That is so backwards. You are condemning all teachers of enlightenment as somehow inferior, when it is actually the opposite. They are exhibiting the highest Love, making sacrifices for you.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with not teaching or living in a cave. But there is also nothing wrong with teaching and living in a city. People have different callings and paths. There is no one superior path. You pick the path which most aligns with who you want to be. Don't expect everyone to follow the same path. Don't expect everyone to follow your path.

			I agree that finding the Inner guru is all it really takes to succeed in the spiritual path but beings like Sadhguru have also created huge waves of consciousness in this world. What is your honest opinion of him and have you ever thought of maybe getting guidance under a real guru such as him to boost your spiritual journey? I'm very curious to your opinion.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A) I have no problem with Sadhguru. He is clearly doing God's work in a masterful way.
</p>

<p>
	B) With that said, you can still easily gets bamboozled, not by him, but by your own mind's worshiping of him. It's precisely because he's so good that you will tend to become dependent on him as your spiritual daddy/authority, which would create a subtle duality in your consciousness and prevent you from thinking independently and walking your own unique path.
</p>

<p>
	C) I have gotten guidance under many real gurus. After I get my guidance I go my own way. I don't hang around to fawn over them, nor do I expect them to do my work for me. I also realize the partiality of any guru's teachings.
</p>

<p>
	The better the teacher, the greater the problem. See that?

	This has never been about the money. It's about helping people understand reality.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well ask, why didn't Jesus or Gandhi retire and live in a cabin in the woods?
</p>

<p>
	They had much higher callings.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse these callings for ego. That would be a big mistake. God does its work through conscious people. How else do you think Goodness happens?

	JP is a thing simply because most of American society is at stage Blue/Orange and refuses to evolve up into Green. So JP provides them the perfect justifications and rationalizations for why Blue/Orange is the best and why Green is evil and dangerous, so that people can feel comfortable not growing higher.
</p>

<p>
	JP is an anti-Green devil, and like all devils, he himself does not understand what he is doing or why he is doing it. He thinks he is doing good. But his ego is distorting the good that is in his heart, thus leading millions of people into devilry.
</p>

<p>
	This is a textbook example of how devilry works.

<p>
	Pentacostals and evangelicals do group spiritual experiences too. Clearly it works to some degree. But will it really make you deeply enlightened? That's the real question. Or will it make you worship Sadhguru?
</p>

<p>
	Take some mushrooms and you don't need Sadhguru or any guru.

<title>I don't want to put off spirituality to handle financial freedom</title>

<p>
	There is not one strategy, there are many
</p>

<p>
	You could focus on gaining financial security first and then go hog-wild on spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could do just the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	It really depends on what your heart wants and what you can handle. It can be very painful to force yourself to work on mundane financial stuff when you are itching to be creative or spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, if your financial situation collapses, that might force you into slave labor and out of your spiritual quest. Again, depending on who you are.
</p>

<p>
	The most spiritually gifted people will never be stopped by financial concerns. But that's not most people. You have to be realistic about what you're gonna be able to handle.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the most direct path to the highest human life, drop everything and go balls deep into spirituality. But that's very hardcore and too difficult for most people to pull off. Most people won't be able to handle it. Hence there are more gradual approaches.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I focused on locking in financial freedom first. But it was pretty painful, to be honest. I would not wish that kind of pain on anyone. But it sure beats being a wage slave.
</p>

<title>Are rural areas more conducive to spirituality?</title>

<p>
	It is easier to get enlightened out in nature than in a busy building full of people. There's a reason yogis meditate up in the mountains and forests. Nature has a tranquilizing effect on the mind.
</p>

<p>
	But don't make this an excuse. You can practice spirituality anywhere.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with rural areas is that the people there will be more closeminded and rednecky. Don't go telling them you're God, or they might hang you. City-folk are more tolerant and open, but more lost in the materialist race rat.
</p>

<title>No motivation for life purpose!!!?</title>

<p>
	You're missing the bigger picture. Your understanding of what life purpose is is far too small. Life purpose is not a materialistic thing, life purpose is the highest spiritual thing! Your spiritual love IS the source of your life purpose. Stop pitting spirituality and LP against each other.
</p>

<p>
	You just need to upgrade your LP to reflect your new spiritual values and orientation.
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose is an expression of your soul. It has nothing to do with money or career per se.
</p>

<p>
	How is your new spiritual awareness going to impact the world??? You're not here to sit around listening to birds chirp for 60 years. You are here to be a creator. What do you want to create?
</p>

<title>Guy Has Commitment Issues</title>

<p>
	This sounds like every man on Earth! Fear of commitment and intimacy.
</p>

<p>
	If he's not willing to give you the proper relationship you want, then move on to someone else. Trying to force a fit is going to turn out badly for both of you. You can't force a mule to drink water. He has to want it.
</p>

<p>
	You need to own your agenda more. Be clear with yourself and with him what you want. If this scares him off, then it was never going to work anyway. If he was really into you and was serious about relating with another human being, he shouldn't be scared off.
</p>

<p>
	You can't fix men. You gotta find a man who already shares your values. One of your values is relationship while it sounds like that's not one of his values.
</p>

<p>
	You need to decide for yourself, not against yourself. Don't bend over backwards for him. He needs to be clear about what he wants out of this. Relationship requires a conscious decision. Both parties have to be willing to invest time and energy into it. It can't be a casual after-thought like, "Okay, we'll try it, but if there is any inconvenience to me, I'm out." No! No! No! It cannot work that way.
</p>

<p>
	I have no desire to steal girls from anyone, nor do I even care much about dating or sex. It's just not a high priority once you become conscious enough.

<title>relative and absolute collapsable?</title>

</p>

<p>
	When you are in Absolute consciousness it's as if the relative never existed.
</p>

<p>
	When you are in relative consciousness then there's a clear difference between relative and Absolute. But that's because you're imagining the Absolute, you're not actually experiencing it.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of an Absolute is that it has no opposite. Opposites exist only in the relative domain.
</p>

<p>
	You need to distinguish between absolute vs Absolute. These are very different things. Absolute with a capital A is the actual thing itself, not an idea, word, or concept. Any time you think of the absolute you're thinking of the lowercase a absolute, not the uppercase A Absolute. Uppercase A Absolute cannot be thought at all nor can it be contrasted with the relative. Uppercase A Absolute is NOT the opposite of relative.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget the systemic, ecological, and societal aspects of food.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Yellow and Turquoise will not just care about their personal nutrition but nutrition as a global system. Which types of food should we be growing? How do we grow it in a sustainable way? What is the impact on global warming, the economy, developing countries, the rain forests, the coral reefs, children, etc. Which foods are most conducive toward elevating the consciousness of mankind? How does food intersect with education, business, government, science, spirituality, etc.?

<p>
	When traditional prayer works it's due to law of attraction and intention. Your intentions DO affect reality. Intention is very powrful when it is practiced consistently and consciously.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you intend with emotion and conviction will tend to become true. Because your will is a splinter off God's Will. You literally have the power of God within you. The more conscious you become the more of it you will be able to tap and manifest.
</p>

<p>
	It's not a miracle. It's because you are God, and reality is a giant Mind.
</p>

	Good stuff. Generally in the right direction towards Truth, you just need to trip a lot more and contemplate the results of your trips more. Each trip gives more clarity and raises further questions.

<p>
	It depends on what you mean by prayer. There is false and true prayer.
</p>

<p>
	False prayer is praying for God to give you stuff. This is dualistic and delusional. Although even it can work.
</p>

<p>
	True prayer is realizing that you are God and putting your heart into embodying the Truth. This can work wonders.
</p>

<p>
	Most people pray mechanically and dogmatically, not consciously and nondually.
</p>

<p>
	You have to wonder, if you were fully conscious that you are God, would you pray to yourself at that point? Prayer subtly implies that you think you are beneath God and separate from God.
</p>

<p>
	Then they are still not fully aware, they are only half-aware. The point of full awareness is that it makes devilry impossible. But there is much to become aware of, and many degrees of awareness, so it's easy for a devil to become half-aware and still act like a devil. Sometimes even more of a devil. Gaps in awareness are very common, which is where the devil lurks.
</p>

<p>
	In practice full awareness is very rare and difficult, so the devil always lurks around the corner.

It convinces itself that there's nothing to awaken to, and goes back to being a devil while telling itself that it is awake.
</p>

<p>
	You are not awake yet. So the most dangerous thing you can convince yourself of is that there's nothing to awaken to. That's wrong. There is lots to awaken to. So get to work!
</p>

<p>
	The seeking only stops AFTER your entire reality collapses and you are totally reborn.
</p>

<p>
	Don't burn your canoe before you crossed the river.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not futile. It is very real and palpable. Awakening is not part of the game. Yet also not separate from it.

<title>How to be aware of awareness?</title>

<p>
	The difficulty results from the fact that awareness is nothing. The mind cannot grasp it in the same way it can grasp a wall or tree or a thought.
</p>

<p>
	So by trying to become aware of awareness you are really trying to realize Nothingness/Emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's frusrating. There is no way around that. You are being asked to grasp the ungraspable.
</p>

<p>
	Through lots of practice the mind must become very still. That stillness of mind itself becomes the empty awareness of awareness. You. Are. It.
</p>

<p>
	Try focusing your mind on nothing in particular and just let it sit there. The more it sits there, the more Emptiness will dawn on you. Don't try to grasp it. Let it wash over you.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment within 10 minutes. No guru needed.
</p>

<p>
	But be careful what you wish for. Can you handle the Truth?

<p>
	We've heard all these get rich quick schemes before. Nothing new. It won't work as advertized. You cannot predict when awakening happens, or guarantee that it will ever happen.

</p>

<p>
	You cannot know Self without knowing Maya too.
</p>

<p>
	Not only is there depth but also breadth, and both are the Self, since Self is all.

<p>
	What is there to say? Yes, you can learn to astral project and visit other realities. Many books have been written about this explaining it all and how it is done. If you are serious about it buy those books and train to do it properly.
</p>

<p>
	But pursuing nonduality would be a better use of your time.

<title>Do women like to be treated like crap?</title>

<p>
	They are attracted to non-neediness. But that is very different than treating people like crap.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget about karma. How you treat others will come back to bite you.
</p>

<p>
	The more you manipulate people, the more deluded you are, the more you will suffer in life.
</p>

<p>
	Conscious & happy people do not manipulate others. By manipulating others you sell your soul to the devil.
</p>
