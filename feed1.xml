It's like having a discussion with a man-child. There's no historical understanding there of how government works. Just ravings about how evil government is.
</p>

<p>
	These positions are often held by young juvenile white males. It's a rebellious phase they grow through. Unfortunately some get stuck on it for life.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarianism is a cancer of the mind.

	The technology is already here and rapidly improving.

<p>
	With some government subsidies, this problem is very realistic to solve.
</p>

<p>
	Wind is not even necessary. Everything can be solar. Solar is the ultimate energy source because it is virtually unlimited. We just need more cells and batteries, which will naturally happen.
</p>

<p>
	We can install solar panels on every rooftop in the world. This is the future. Solar is only going to get cheaper and more efficient.
</p>

<p>
	Coal and nuclear is already going out of business. With a proper carbon tax, solar will become king.

<p>
	I explained it a lot in my video: What Is Love?
</p>

<p>
	And we'll certainly talk more about it in future episodes. But talking about it is also quite pointless. You cannot understand Love through talk. You must find it by doing the practices. You must open your heart.
</p>

<p>
	What good does it do for me to tell you that everything is love? It's as useless as telling people that they are God. Telling people doesn't work. They must awaken to it.

<p>
	What you're asking cannot really be explained. You gotta undertake a personal journey of validate various religious and scientific metaphysical claims.
</p>

<p>
	Reading an explanation in a book doesn't help because that's just begging the question. That book then becomes your new dogma. You need to find a way to determine which books you can trust. You cannot do that based on my recommendations because do you not know if I am correct or not.
</p>

<p>
	The pursuit of truth must be independent of all human sources.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's very wide question. A whole book could be written about that because there is so much stuff religions say.
</p>

<p>
	God, for example, is not a dogma. But! For most religious people it is.
</p>

<p>
	Dogma is not just about true vs false, dogma is about how you hold it. If a perosn holds a true thing as a belief which he has no direct experience of, it's still a dogma.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you are absolutely sure the Earth is round, that's a dogma, even if the Earth turns out to be round once you look down on it from orbit.
</p>

<p>
	But if you have actually seen the round Earth with your own eyes, then it's not a dogma.

<p>
	I doubt total harmony is possible. Total harmony is death. There will always be stuggle in life. That's the nature of survival. It's just a question of how much harmony and complexity a particular stage of cognitive development can sustain.
</p>

<p>
	China is mosty stage Blue and they have over 1 billion people. Of course they are an ecological disaster, but they do live in some degree of harmony as a society.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Absolute Love is idenetical to your true nature.
</p>

<p>
	There are facets to the Absolute. These facets can be realized in any order and at various levels of comprehensiveness.
</p>

<p>
	But don't be confused, all of these facets are identical to one another in the end. But even so, it is important to realize them individually. It is not enough to realize one facet and think you automatically understand all the rest, even though they are one in the end.

<p>
	WinterKnight is not conscious what love is. He has not had an awakening to Absloute Love.
</p>

<p>
	I keep telling you guys, this goes way deeper than you think. There are many facets to awakening and very few people have become conscious of all of them.
</p>

<p>
	Most of the people you look up to, who you think are fully awake, are not.
</p>

<p>
	This work is extremely, extremely tricky.

<p>
	Only by your own authority.

<p>
	That's the whole magic of reality. There isn't one! So there is no one in the universe to say what is real. So people make up all sorts of shit.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of reality is that there is no external source you can turn to for clear answers because due to nonduality, all sources are actually yourself.
</p>

<p>
	This was the point of my: How Authority Works video.
</p>

<p>
	People have various levels of awakening, and beyond that, their minds can interpret their awakenings in very different ways. People's brains also function differently, producing different realities.

	You have to take into account the scaling problem. It's easy to live in harmony with nature when you got 500 people. Now see how they behave as 500 million people. All hell breaks loose.

<title>Higher taxation of the rich, backfires.</title>

<p>
	Taxing rich people doesn't cripple their motivation. This is a myth.
</p>

<p>
	Money is an improper motivator in a conscious society. You would have our most creative people be prostitutes. This is an insult to turly creative people.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't assume wealthy people are the most creative people. Right now, the wealthiest people are often the best exploiters of society. Why should such exploitation be rewarded?

</blockquote>

<p>
	The smaller states are over-represented in the Senate. In fact this is one of our biggest problems. The least developed rural states have a majority strangle hold over the Senate which makes it impossible to pass progressive legislation.
</p>

<p>
	What the smaller rural states don't appreciate is just how much their boats are lifted by the largest and most progressive states like NY, California, Washington, etc. These states pay the bulk of taxes because they add massive economic value. Yet their votes are not worth as much.
</p>

<p>
	Votes should be allocated by people, not by state. Otherwise you have a backward democracy where the minority opinion actually rules the majority. Just think about it, why should a president with the minority of popular votes win while the one with the majority lose? It makes no sense. If the guy you voted for won the popular vote but lost the election, you'd rightly be upset. Especially if two such elections lead to disastrous policies like the Iraq War and the Trump administration. What makes all this particularly galling is that the most conscious candidates are actually winning the popular vote, but still losing the election!
</p>

<p>
	If California was properly represented under the principle of 1 person, 1 vote, America would be able to pass significantly more progressive legislation. Right now we have the least developed parts of the country cockblocking humane legislation.
</p>

<p>
	California, NY, and Washington lead the way on progressive legislation: clean air, clean energy, living wage, etc, etc. Alabama ain't putting forth the most conscious & loving policies.

			What do you all think of people like Matt Kahn? (especially you "awake" people on this forum) He seems to have a lot of contradictory information and states that since we are in the 5th dimension now, what worked in the past simply doesn't work anymore. He generally doesn't like a lot of the teachings like, the drop your story, the world is an illusion, there is no self. He says those are all stages that you need to wake up from quickly because they are <strong>not</strong> helpful. I understand the goal of self inquiry. But Matt Kahn says you come back to the body to fully be the character that you are, so all of this, "who is the one typing?", "there's no one there", although true, is NOT USEFUL.

	That's right, enlightenment is generally not useful. Enlightenment is the transcendence of survival, value, right/wrong, meaning, usefulness, etc.

And all of this through self love, which doesn't really seem to get talked about a lot here. Leo talks a lot about how enlightened people are humble. That's close, but how important is Self love in an enlightenment journey?

<p>
	That's also right. Love is ultimately where all this no-self business leads. Absolute Self Love is the end result of profound enlightenment.

	It doesn't contradict Self Love. These are two sides of the same coin. So don't turn this into a false choice. Realize no-self. Realize The Self. Realize God. Realize Love. Realize Infinity. Realize Nothingness. Then you will be ready to save the world.

<p>
	Yes, they are mostly Purple in their cognitive development.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be nuanced here and distinguish various developmental lines: moral, interpersonal, political, cognitive, spiritual, and so forth. While their spiritual line could be advanced, their other lines can be very low.
</p>

<p>
	Those tribes are not all rainbows and butterflies. They will rape you and boil your skull for dinner if you are from the wrong tribe. Tribal warfare is a notorious problem.

<p>
	No, I know that many of you are averse to psychedelics, so when I say practices, I mean all the traditional practices as well.

<p>
	I have given you guys lists of practices in the past.
</p>

<p>
	You also have to keep in mind that I share some extremely advanced insights on my blog and in my videos. Some of the things I talk about will not be understood hardly by anyone. And that's okay. Most people here are not really seriously interested in Truth or understanding, you're here for the smaller purpose of improving your life. So what that means is you will not access the deepest things I talk about, but you can still improve your life significantly.
</p>

<p>
	Accessing the deepest things I talk about will require something special -- whatever that means. But don't worry. Even if you only access 30% of what I talk about you will be in the top 0.1% of mankind.

<p>
	The future is not predetermined. The future will be whatever God decides it to be. Which means, whatever we decide it to be, since we are God. The unfolding of life IS the very mechanism by which God creates the future.
</p>

<p>
	This is it! God is deciding right NOW what the future will be! You are doing it!
</p>

<p>
	If you decide to pick your nose, that's what God decided. Until you pick your nose, God hasn't decided it.

<p>
	Of course they would disagree. That's them defending their survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	You know what though? If you tell slave-owners to give up their slaves, a funny thing happens: they disagree and complain that they are being treated unfairly.
</p>

<p>
	When you point out to a racist person that he is being racist, he starts to complain about reverse-racism and white genocide. That's what devils do.
</p>

<p>
	We do not let such devilry deter us from creating a more fair and conscious society.

<p>
	The problem with only talking about personal responsibility is that it becomes a blank check for selfishness. People take personal responsibility to maximize their profits & success by exploiting and manipulating the collective.
</p>

<p>
	The easiest road to wealth & success is by exploiting the collective. So of course that's what people do.

<p>
	This is not merely a question of insurance coverage, this is an issue of wealth redistribution.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental problem is that the entire healthcare industry's profit margins are way too high. They are artificially high because people's lives are being held hostage in the negotiation and people are negotiating with both hands tied behind their backs due to how the healthcare industry created a cartel.
</p>

<p>
	It would be like if me and a few of my rich friends bought up every source of fresh drinkable water in your state and then charged you 10x to have a drink. And when you complained about how unfair this system is, we'd invest $100 million dollars in a propaganda campaign to call you Communists.
</p>

<p>
	The government is the only organization which has the leverage to renegotiate the terms of the deal.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, doctors & executives will have to settle for earning less money so that more people can live. That's what this whole discussion is really about and no one wants to admit it. A bold politician must rise up who will say, point-blank: "You guys will earn less money, for the greater good. Sorry, not sorry." Bernie Sanders is one such politician.

	All physical manifestation whatsoever is a direct manifestation of God's Will, Intelligence, and Love for itself.
</p>

<p>
	Love is pure creativity and Absolute Freedom.

<p>
	When you die, you become Infinite Love. Unbounded, unlimited, formless, infinite. There is no difference between life or death, other than in your mind.

It is not at odds with science at all. In science you are required to write lengthy research papers just like in philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	Philosophy has nothing to do with lengthy answers. It's about discovering truth & wisdom through inquiry, and then embodying it in your life. How many words it takes is irrelevant.

<p>
	In the long term, yes, gun culture must change. But it's not just gun culture, it's also the alienation and various radical ideologies which much change.
</p>

<p>
	And also notice, in your slavery example, how much blood had to be spilled for that to change. Culture always changes, but not without a fight. Which is precisely what we're seeing today in the news. The transition from Blue/Orange to Green will involve violent resistance.

<p>
	It's not about words or semantics. There is a distinct facet to awakening that is the realization of Absolute Love. This is a facet that you simply have not yet become conscious of. You might be conscious of the Self, or of Truth, or of Infinite Consciousness, but you are not conscious that the Self and Truth and Consciousness are Love. Or that the purpose of all Creation is Love.
</p>

<p>
	That word Love rings hollow to your hears because you lack a reference experience for it. This can only be solved through a deep awakening into the existential nature of Love.
</p>

<p>
	What teachers? How about the guy in my signature. Ever read his work?

			Don't you think having so many guns on a private level is creating this problem? And as far as i know, most of the advance countries do not allow this in their own country.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, it is definitely creating a problem. But that's not the question. The question, how do you fix it?
</p>

<p>
	It's easy in other countries because you guys have never had a Wild West gun culture. It's like trying to ban pickup trucks in Europe. That would be very easy because they are basically non-existent. But how do you ban 300 million firearms?
</p>

<p>
	Just because you ban something does not mean people stop using it. If only it were so easy.
</p>

<p>
	To truly fix this problem requires changing the culture. Which is analogous to asking Japanese people to stop eating fish. Good luck with that. They won't even stop hunting whales. Because it's in their culture.
</p>

<p>
	By your attitude it is clear that you are not awake to what Love is.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate: What is Love? until it kills you, until you drown in it. Only then will your awakening be complete.

	They are not just going to skip from stage Blue to Green. They will go through all the mistakes and pathologies that America went through. But it will take them even longer because at least America had free speech, freedom of religion, and democratic elections from day 1. It will take China 50-100 years to sort that out.

<p>
	I doubt it would help. He's too far gone. His ego will probably co-op any mystical insights and make him an even bigger devil. After Hitler was nearly assassinated by a bomb blast, he rationalized it to himself that God saved his life so that he could fulfill his mission of exterminating the Jews. How do you cure someone like that? His mind was way too radicalized with ideology.
</p>

<p>
	If there was a practical way to save him, I'd be for it.

<p>
	China is not more spiritually advanced. China is stage Blue, just starting to move into Orange. They have massive growing pains ahead of them. China is becoming extremely materialistic and will face all the same problems America has been facing for the last 50 years. They have serious systemic corruption which will take them 50+ years to cleanse out.
</p>

<p>
	China will not be Green for another 50 years at least. They haven't even figured out how to let their people vote. America is far more developed and conscious than China. The Chinese are still ethnically cleansing certain provinces in western China.

It just doesn't make sense to pay that.
</p>

<p>
	The point of Medicare For All is that it would have the leverage necessary to significantly negotiate down the costs of healthcare. Right now the system is way more expensive than it needs to be because of the private health insurance middleman. This middleman makes a huge profit while providing very little value and actually adding negative value with all the byzantine paperwork.

	This is not a systemic solution.

	If your solution is have people save up money to pay for $100,000 surgeries and cancer treatments, that will result in the unnecessary deaths and suffering of millions of people.

	Don't then be surprised when some depressed, angry guy walks into a school and shoots your child in the face. All because that guy is pissed off that his child died of a cancer which he didn't have the money to treat.

	Don't forget, everything is connected in society. What goes around comes around. If you treat people like animals they will act like animals.

Folks with psychic abilities usually experience voices and things of that sort, which they can find overwhelming at first until they learn how to manage it.
</p>

<p>
	This is sorta the shaman's path. The important thing is not to misinterpret this as going crazy or as something that's wrong. You should try to see it as a blessing in disguise, a gift. But you'll have to go through some inner turmoil to fully realize how to make use of this gift for the greater good of mankind. It's a journey of self-discovery. You are discovering hidden aspects of yourself and reality. Don't expect to fit in with mainstream folks. Try to find some shamans or others with these kinds of psychic or paranormal abilities. They would be in the best position to guide you and give you advice. Personally I never experience that kind of stuff, but I know it's a real thing.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that you are developing schizophrenia. Rather your mind is opening up to new dimensions of reality which are not yet recognized by mainstream culture. Become curious about these new dimensions. They might be worth exploring.

<p>
	This is exactly what the right-wingers foresee and the reason they get so defensive and don't allow any gun laws whatsoever. They see it as a slippery slope which will eventually lead to the ban of even handguns.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest fear of right-wingers is that liberals will take away all their guns through a gradual series of bans.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, we have a 2nd Amendment here:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	So you cannot ban all firearms without a Constitutional Amendment, which requires 3/4ths of all states to agree. This is highly unrealistic.
</p>

<p>
	I propose a compromise where liberals guarantee that handguns and hunting rifles will not be banned, in return for sensible gun control. But see, right-wingers won't even agree to that because they will think it's just a ploy with further bans to come (as your strategy suggests).
</p>

<p>
	In the very long term (perhaps 100 years), I agree that many kinds of firearms will probably end up banned. But not without a fight. The right-wingers understand this, so they are already digging in their heels.
</p>

	Bernie will not be able to pass Medical For All with winning the Senate and also massive popular support from the people. His whole strategy is to lead a cultural movement to get it done. It won't be easy and he knows that. It needs to become a cultural movement along the lines of Civil Rights in the 60's.
</p>

<p>
	The health insurance industry will throw hundreds of millions of dollars to stop Bernie if he starts to get close. They will fight this thing to the bitter end. The devilry will get shameless because that industry will be fighting for its life like a cornered racoon.

<p>
	I actually don't see this as a big problem. We've already had weapons of mass destruction technology for a long time. It is very strictly regulated and so no citizens can realistically access it.
</p>

<p>
	You can't access rocket launchers, flame throwers, grenades, chemical weapons, land mines, etc. That stuff is so dangerous even the most extreme gun advocates are not foolish enough to suggest that people have a right to own rocket launchers.
</p>

<p>
	Really, the trickiest case is hand guns. Because on the one hand they are very reasonable to own. But on the other hand, they are still very lethal and can cause a mass shooting when in the wrong hands. How do you regulate that? That's a very tricky balance.
</p>

<p>
	I would like to see mandatory gun safety training courses for anyone who wants to own a firearm. Similar to getting a driver's license. But of course this still won't be enough to stop mass shootings.
</p>

It is simply unrealistic to get rid of them all.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically you cannot get rid of handguns, shotguns, and hunting rifles. And those alone are enough to create many mass shootings.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, we can have better background checks and ban assault rifles, but a handgun is enough to kill 10-20 people. Handguns are NOT going away.
</p>

<p>
	So this problem needs to be addressed at a deeper, cultural level.
</p>

<p>
	If only it was as simple as banning guns.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to understand is that American culture is big on hunting and guns. You have to take this into account. You can't just compare America to Europe or Japan because our cultures are different. Americans will not ban handguns. And even if we did, millions of people would just own them illegally because they would disagree with the spirit of the ban. It would be like banning weed or alcohol. You can't ban something which millions of people think is reasonable to own.
</p>

<p>
	Banning handguns would be as unrealistic as banning cars. Responsible gun owners will get understandably very upset when you penalize them for the actions of a handful of extremists. There are 10s of millions of responsible gun owners. Try to imagine how you'd feel if some kid shot up a school after playing Grand Theft Auto, so then we ban all Grand Theft Auto games. Millions of decent Grand Theft Auto players would be pissed because out of 10 million players there is bound to be one extremist.
</p>

<p>
	The reason the problem of mass shooting hasn't been resolved is because it's a very tricky problem.
</p>

<p>
	Even if the Democrats succeed in passing strict gun regulation, I still predict mass shootings will continue to happen. So what then? How do you solve that?
</p>

I looked at Japan and I was kind of surprised. 
		</p>

		<p>
			It's not like I think, that Japan is an undeveloped country, but it is indeed a very tricky one. I've spoken to many Japanese people and I have the feeling that they are trying to make everything look perfect, but their picture of perfection is very blue/orange. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I think that their collective ego is much stronger than in other countries, they are hiding so many things, they have issues with thinking independently. You can see how this causes them to have one of the highest suicide rates in the world.
		</p>

		<p>
			What do you think about this?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, that's mostly just classic stage Blue/Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Japan is very ethnically isolated and monocultural. They don't have much diversity. They tend to be either very old school and traditional, or modern and materialistic. They work themselves to death and they are extremely conformist. Stage Orange and stage Blue qualities.
</p>

<p>
	Japan might develop faster if they had more cultural and racial diversity. Without that diversity it becomes like inbreeding, an echo chamber of the same old ideas with not enough cross-pollination or people challenging the accepted paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Highly diverse places (like big cosmopolitan cities) are forced to be progressive and innovative. Which is why rural areas tend to be so backwards and deeply stage Blue. Stage Blue can only be maintained through lack of multiculturalism. Which is why conservatives tend to hate multiculturalism. They view it as an evil. Because they want to be monocultural. Multiculturalism makes them scared and uncomfortable because it threatens to erode their simplistic nationalist identities.
</p>

<p>
	Japanese culture values politeness over truth. This is problematic. And yeah, that leads to hiding serious issues under a fake veneer of politeness and deference.
</p>

<p>
	Their suicide rates demonstrate the limitations of unchecked materialism. If you run materialism to the hilt, what you'll get is depression and suicidal thoughts as you realize that no amount of material success leads to happiness, but you won't know any alternative (because materialism denies spirituality). So the only way out becomes suicide.
</p>

<p>
	Our materialist culture doesn't properly teach people that the solution to depression and suicide is genuine spiritual practice. So yes, suicide, alienation, and depression in materialistic cultures will skyrocket until the lesson is learned.

<title>Is Bernie Sander’s medicare for all plan really the most conscious?</title>

So it's only usable if I have a serious illness/surgery. And under this plan, my choice of doctors is extremely limited. My insurance does not cover my favorite doctors. I have to go to the worst doctors in town if I want insurance to cover it. Otherwise I'd need a much more expensive insurance plan.
</p>

<p>
	This makes preventative care very hard.
</p>

<p>
	The system is not designed to help sick people, it is designed to exploit the sick.

<p>
	It's not fantastic even if you have money.
</p>

<p>
	I am considered upper class. I buy my own health insurance. It still sucks. It's very expensive, deductibles are very high, and the paperwork is so complex and full of so many scams and loopholes that if I had a serious health issue it would be nightmare to deal with. I basically pay for it but never use it. I pay for all my medicine and basic doctors visits cash, out of pocket just to avoid dealing with all the limitations and hassles of my insurance.
</p>

<p>
	This winter I went for a couple of doctors visits for a common cold/flu. I was supposed to pay like $50 co-pays and that's it. Then 3 months later they send me a bill for $300 more that I supposedly owe them. Yet none of these costs/fees were told to me upfront. That's how the system is deliberately designed to work. No costs are fairly announced. The system is so byzantine and opaque by design so that they could charge you any ridiculous fees they want. No other industry works this way. It's totally corrupt and needs to be nuked from on high.
</p>

<p>
	And I'm not even talking about the thousands of people who die every year due to lack of coverage. But the hassles of dealing with all the paperwork alone is enough to warrant nuking the system. It's absurdly inefficient.
</p>

<p>
	Meanwhile in Canada you can just go to the doctor for a surgery and pay nothing out of pocket. And no absurd paperwork.
</p>

			You need to be extra careful if that's the way you're going to place your stones. There is a huge difference between relying on individual subjectivity and the struggle to build something based on consensual subjectivity. I don't intend to discuss this point here. I'm just saying that arguing that the scientific method arises from subjectivity won't quite cut it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Keep in mind that the most refined scientists do not confuse science with Truth. So if you say that to them as an attempt to wake them up to the spiritual dimension it won't even scratch their surface.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can't avoid the truth of the matter.
</p>

<p>
	What the scientist needs to realize is that all science is mediated through subjective experience and that it could not be otherwise. To skip over this point is the crux of problem. This is a giant epistemic oversight on their part.
</p>

<p>
	The subjectivity of science is the elephant in the room that no scientist wants to acknowledge.
</p>

<p>
	The very belief that science is objective is itself a subjective belief! Science is objective because one imagines it to be so.

<p>
	These shootings are an expected phenomena of a hyper materialistic society. As stage Orange runs its course, the limitations of Blue/Orange will become more and more apparent in the form of these kinds of ego backlashes. But this shines collective awareness on the problem, which will ultimately lead to its resolution and a transition into a stage Green society.
</p>

<p>
	Banning guns will not be enough to resolve this. What's necessary is to make society more fair and to provide more opportunities and social support for alienated people.
</p>

<p>
	It's an alienation problem. Alienated, nihilistic, depressed, angry, impoverished, poorly-socialized, and sexually frustrated people adopt radical and violent ideologies. Same as in the Middle East.
</p>

<p>
	As stage Orange becomes more and more excessive and unhealthy, alienation will increase, violence and radicalism will increase.
</p>

<p>
	When people lack a proper spiritual connection to life, they become hopeless and turn to drugs, sex, exploitation of others, and nationalist ideologies.
</p>

<p>
	This is why it's important to foster a sense of community and to help those who are in bad shape. Because if they are not helped, they will not simply suffer silently by themselves, they will lash out at the world. These shootings are really a cry for help. Society is failing not only the victims of these shootings, but the shooters especially. The shooters are lashing out because they don't have proper channels for getting the love they want in healthy ways.
</p>

<p>
	And of course Trump is pouring gasoline on this problem because he epitomizes toxic Orange while goading on Blue and demonizing Green.
</p>

<p>
	All advanced democracies except the US have public healthcare systems that work.

	Generally speaking, if mood goes up, it must come down. And since its all relative, you will perceive any drop in mood from its peak as a terrible thing.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind cannot evaluate absolute values of mood, only relative changes. So to jump from 50 to 100 and then back down to 50 is perceived the same as dropping from 50 to 0.

</p>

<p>
	Trump's wealth is a total con. But stage Orange doesn't care. To stage Orange, the appearance of wealth is as valid as actual wealth and it doesn't matter to stage Orange that his wealth was acquired through white collar crime and various kinds of exploitative schemes. Stage Orange just wants that golden toilet, damn the costs.
</p>

<p>
	To stage Orange, success = truth.
