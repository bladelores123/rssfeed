	Trump is rallying mindless people to gain power. That's all this is.

<p>
	Awakening is not a belief and cannot be embodied through any kind of actions or mental manipulations.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to understand awakening is to awaken. This requires a radical shift in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can help you quickly see how much you're missing.

<title>Asking girls before kissing them?</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13429-mada_/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13429" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13429-mada_/" rel="">@Mada_</a> There is no such need.
</p>

<p>
	All you need is to make direct eye contact and move your body/face within a foot of her's. If she doesn't hold eye contact or tries to lean away, she's not receptive. If she gives you puppy-dog eyes, then that's your green light.
</p>

<p>
	One final trick is to slowly brush her hair to the side with your fingers, and slowly run your fingers down her jaw line. If she flinches, she's not receptive and do not kiss her. If she maintains eye contact then she definitely wants to be kissed.
</p>

<p>
	Really, it's all about the eye contact. Look at her erotically in the eyes and hold it steady. If she maintains it, it's on boy!
</p>

<p>
	Another trick is if you go in for the kiss and she refuses it by leaning away. You brush it off as though nothing bad happened and try again 5-10 mins later. Keep trying even if she is resisting. Eventually she should relent.
</p>

<p>
	It's also important to time the moment. The mood has to be right. The best time to go for a kiss is after you've made her laugh. When she's in a good mood, she'll be much more receptive.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't make it a big deal. Don't make it some formal, stiff thing. The mood has to be light and casual so there is no nervousness or awkwardness about it.
</p>

<p>
	When you go for the kiss, decide on it and commit 100%. The worst thing you can do is be seconding-guessing yourself in your mind and half-assing it. Just assume that she wants it and that it will succeed. Don't be playing images of failure in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	If a girl is on a date with you, she's already agreed in her mind that she is willing to sleep with you. Otherwise she would have never agreed to the date in the first place. So all you gotta do is not be awkward or creepy.
</p>

<p>
	You need to build comfort and ease by doing lots of touching throughout the date. Then kissing is easy and natural. It is awkward and creepy when you go for half the date without a single touch. Get your hands around her body ASAP. You gotta be finding excuses to touch her all throughout the date. Tickle her and so forth in a playful way to break the ice.
</p>

<p>
	And finally, if you wanna use words, rather than asking, the better way is to declare it: "You look yummy. I feel like kissing you now." You must say it in a way where you are not fishing for her permission but stating your genuine desire and intention.
</p>

<p>
	If something is Absolute, it is everything and everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	So the funny thing is, there is nothing but the Absolute. You can't escape it or avoid it. You are enmeshed in it at all times no matter what is happening.

<p>
	No, actual Truth is not a concept, thought, idea, or perspective. It is what is.
</p>

<p>
	Conceptual truths are partial and never complete. Conceptual truths are relative and subjective.
</p>

<p>
	Don't assume that reality is logical.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No necessarily.
</p>

<p>
	First, access infinite intelligence, and then let's talk.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

			Sort of like when you think you want 2 different things, e.g. you want to live both an expressive life and a passive life of meditation. One might think that those are conflicting interests only if they didn't see that they are complementary truths. One wouldn't make much sense without the other, and thus they can not just coexist, but they actually create a richness in what would otherwise be a rather bland experience (only appreciation would be rather colourless, and only expressivity wouldn't be very worthwhile).
		</p>

		<p>
			It just seems to me that there is always an integration possible that includes two seemingly contradictory goals, in a manner that doesn't exclude anything (making it not a compromise, but a win-win situation).
		</p>

		<p>
			Since reality is completely logical (meaning any statementÂ can only be derived from a prior statements), doesn't that mean that complete falsehood is metaphysically impossible? I.e. regardless of how inclusive this statement is of other perspectives, it is still true relative to the goals ofÂ perspective that imagined them.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Your thinking is quite muddled here.
</p>

<p>
	Many of your assumptions are groundless. Awakening is not about integrating various human worldviews.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			As such, when you say thatÂ the goal of the devilÂ to spread ignorance, I interpret that as that their goal is toÂ raise confusion (muddying of the waters as you call it). Yet what I'm claiming is that for every attempt the devil makes to do this, it should be possible that to instead of fighting his claims through force (which is the very same process the devil uses right?), instead an integrationÂ with thisÂ truth is possible that creates a higher truth which isÂ inclusive of both truths, making it impossible for anyone listening to fight this truth because there is no logical denying it possible. The ultimate extrapolation of this would be a truth so all-inclusive that it includes everything that can ever be said, every story that can ever happen, etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There are far too many deluded worldviews on this planet to take them all seriously. You have limited time and attention. If you take every fool on this planet seriously, you will never awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Cut the shit and go straight for awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Access the Absolute Truth. Access Infinite Intelligence. It's possible. I've done it. Many others have too. There's nothing to debate here. You either do the practices or you are just clowningÂ around.
</p>

<p>
	That's what this entire thread is, clowning around.
</p>

<p>
	Many scans have been done, but it makes no real difference to you.

	The Majority Report and The Michael Brooks Show on YouTube does a good job of talking about Brazillian politics.
</p>

<p>
	Michael Brooks has been a champion of freeing Lula.
</p>

<p>
	The Intercept is a top notch journalist outfit which covers the corruption in Brazil. Check out videos by Glen Greenwald.
</p>

<p>
	Bolsonaro is def not good for Brazil.

<p>
	But honestly, it sounds to me like you're just making too big a deal out of it.
</p>

<p>
	A small to medium dose of 5-MeO should be fine.
</p>

<p>
	I find 5-MeO-DMT to be a very benign and straight-forward process. It's just like cranking up the consciousness dial in your head to 11. Relax and enjoy the pure consciousness. It might take a few trips to get comfortable with it.

<p>
	If I were to compromise with a materialist devil, I would only debase myself. It's the devil's strategy to get you to compromise with him. He will kick and scream to get you to take him seriously.

<p>
	Remember, all that a devil has to do to win is muddly the waters. That's the game here. The devil cannot win in actualityÂ because he is coming from falsehood. The devil wins by getting you distracted from Truth and Love.

<p>
	There is nothing but states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is the only thing that exists.
</p>

<p>
	To criticize something as a state of consciousness is just silly, since things can't be anything else.
</p>

<p>
	All criticism occurs within a state of consciousness. If you deny what I'm saying, that too is a state of consciousness. So there's no escaping consciousness. State of consciousness dictates physical reality, biology, and everything else. Your biology is just a state of consciousness. If your heart is beating right now, that's a state of consciousness you are in. Change the state and your heart will disappear like it never existed.

<p>
	It's good for you guys to see both the incredible bullshit of religion, and the incredible value of religion. That's the twisted paradox of it.
</p>

<p>
	Try to hold both views in your mind at the same time. It's good for stretching the mind.
</p>

<p>
	There is value in what Ralston and Sadhguru both have to say.

<p>
	With love, empathy, and compassion.
</p>

<p>
	Confront reality as it is. A big part of reality is that it can be ruthless and tragic. That's what makes it feel "real".
</p>

<p>
	Embrace the tragedy of it. That's part of its stark beauty.

	Go turn on the burner in your kitchen and try to stick your hand as close to it as you can.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	The trick is that if the mind imagines that something has meaning, then it does.
</p>

<p>
	So the irony is, people who deeply imagine Jesus can actually materialize Jesus. Of course the problem is that they then fool themselves into thinking that that's the only way.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine that Sanskrit is valuable, then it becomes so.
</p>

<p>
	If you imagine that Sanskrit is just some sounds, then it becomes so.
</p>

<p>
	The key is becoming conscious of how you're imagining all this. What are you giving meaning to?
</p>

<p>
	For example, Ralston gives meaning to martial arts. But is martial arts any less silly than going to a shrine? What is martial arts really? It's the silliest thing in the world if you think about it. Two monkeys fighting each other to be top monkey. Why?
</p>

<p>
	Then again, why do anything? So long as you're alive you gotta occupy your time somehow.
</p>

<p>
	Evil doesn't exist!
</p>

<p>
	Evil if what "you" -- an ego self -- has labeled stuff which threatens your existence as an ego self.
</p>

<p>
	Fortunately the ego-self is not real, so it cannot really be harmed. Harm is illusory. But it sure feels real from your POV. That's the power of ego. Ego imagines evil. This is the cost of being born. You can't be born without dying.

<p>
	You are confusing your ego self with God.
</p>

<p>
	God proper has no needs or lack.
</p>

<p>
	Any need or lack you feel is simply the human ego self striving to survive. As a human you have real needs to stay alive. So go ahead and satisfy some of them. Just don't get too lost in a never-ending quest of satisying survival needs as that is a road to hell.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you should go make some friends.
</p>

<p>
	But God properÂ is above such things.
</p>

<p>
	Turning inwards and facing loneliness is a good spiritual practice, but it's an advanced practice for people who are ready for such things. It's not a solution to socialization problems.

<p>
	It would be rather selfish to hoard all that love for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Think about this very simply in human terms: if you just won the lottery for infinite dollars, what would you do? You'd give it all away to your family and loved ones. Why? Because it's fucking infinite! You've got nothing you lose!
</p>

<p>
	How petty would you have to be to not share it?
</p>

<p>
	What is the point of being an all-powerful God if you cannot share your Beauty and Goodness with everyone?
</p>

<p>
	Can you think of anything better for God to do? What would you do if you were God? Seriously. Think about it. What would you do?
</p>

<p>
	In the end you will come to this one conclusion: there is nothing else for God to do but share its infinite love. There can be no higher purpose. Any other purpose would not be worthy of God.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, God has no needs. What would you do if you had absolutely no need or lack? You'd radiate Love!
</p>

</p>

<p>
	P.S. God IS bathing in Love for all of eternity. That bath is your experience. God loses nothing by creating you. You AREÂ God's Love!
</p>

<p>
	If you truly love yourself, why not touch yourself? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

	Because I recognize that all symbols are relative and arbitrary. They make sense within a given system. They have as much meaning as you give them.

<p>
	God inventsÂ and understands all symbols. And itsÂ understanding goes even deeper than anything symbols can depict.

<p>
	If you like my symbols, cool, but also don't take them too seriously, in the same way that you don't want to get too attached to a single language.

<p>
	No amount of psychedelics can help so long as the person maintains the context of "it's all just wackyÂ stuff happening in the brain." That materialist anchor must be challenged until it is realized that the brain was merely a conceptual fabrication.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it takes radical openmindedness to even take such a possibility seriously. It just does not occur to most people that their brain could be a hallucination. Let alone all of material reality, let alone their birth as a self.
</p>

<p>
	This is radical work we're doing here folks. The mindfuck of it is epic beyond description. It is twisted as fuck.

<p>
	There are many options.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering mindfully is a very direct path towards awakening, but it's hard to do precisely because it involves the thing you hate most: lots of suffering!
</p>

<p>
	Or you could do some other spiritual practice like meditation, yoga, psychedelics, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The following videos might help you:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		How To Deal With Strong Negative Emotions
	</li>
	<li>
		Awareness Alone Is Curative
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Psychedelics are a great way to learn about suffering.

</p>

<p>
	But see, you don't like that. You want to transcend suffering but stay an ego. That cannot happen. You have to completely surrender until you realize you were never born. At which point you become immortal.
</p>

<p>
	You die by realizing you were never born. That thing you think you are -- it's imaginary. Like Santa Claus. This must be directly realized. This realization is what we call awakening/enlightenment around here. It's like realizing that Santa Claus never existed. The only difference is that instead of Santa Claus, it's YOU!
</p>

<p>
	You cannot end suffering without awakening.
</p>

<p>
	This was the Buddha's great teaching.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you'll need to go even deeper than awakening. You'll need to also study and become deeply conscious of how survival dominates your entire life.

<p>
	To survive as a self! Suffering is the resistance of the self to dissolution.
</p>

<p>
	If you didn't suffer, you'd literally die and become God.
</p>

<p>
	<u><strong>Suffering is the activity you invented to keep yourself from merging with God!</strong></u>

<title>Why do we suffer when we donât really want to?</title>

<p>
	Suffering is survival.
</p>

<p>
	To stop suffering you'd have to transcend survival. But you don't know anything other than survival, so you're stuck.
</p>

<p>
	Even your desire to escape suffering is a form of survival, which of course just ends up creating more suffering.
</p>

<p>
	You are guys are not taking survival seriously enough as a topic. There is no more important topic to understand than survival.
</p>

<title>Reconciling Stage Green Productivity</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14265-clouffy/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14265" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14265-clouffy/" rel="">@clouffy</a> Green generally reduces the importance of productivity in favor of deepening relationships.
</p>

<p>
	This is not to say Green stops getting work done, but that macho desire to out-work all your competitors takes a back seat to building and enjoying relationships with human beings.
</p>

<p>
	So maybe rather than working overtime to publish 100 research papers, you devote more of your time to working one on one with your students and you become known as the most beloved professor by your students.
</p>

<p>
	Just an example.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, relationships can be powerful. Deep relationships can open many doors for you in life, so you may not have to work as hard.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, nothing wrong with work as long as it aligns with your values. Your work should be working towards embodying or spreading Green values. Then you'll be motivated. Instead of personal achievement and success, Green is more motivated to help people / environment.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I work a lot less than I used to when my center of gravity was Orange. Today I make a lot of time for chilling out, tripping, contemplation, and deepening my connection to God. This would be unthinkable to an Orange person. I still do work, but it happens more organically at a deeper level. There's less raw output, but more depth and enjoyment. I'm less neurotic about work. My sense of self is less identified with the quantity of work I do.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Hehe, that's a tough one. Academia is not generally open to that. Maybe you should reconsider being in academia. That's what I did. I have no desire to play their games.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, there certainly are ways to make it work.

</p>

<p>
	Of course Infinity includes both sentience and non-sentience, as that is a duality and a distinction which God imagines.
</p>

<p>
	God's plan is Love and Goodness. Awaken deeply to get the confirmation. Logic nor science will be sufficient. It is beyond communication or language.
</p>

<p>
	The confirmation of the most advanced things I teach is always: awakening. There cannot be any other way. You cannot use some dumb mechanical means to realize God's plan.

<p>
	Yes, prayer works, but you must be conscious that you are praying to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You also need to have a proper understanding of what "works" means in this context. Don't be praying for material stuff or the fulfillment of egoic needs. Pray for selflessness and unconditional love. Prayer for the end of your devilry.

<p>
	Of course you cannot just drop your POV. This takes decades of deconstructive work and numerous mystical experiences.

<p>
	In practice, less than 0.001% of the human population will ever discover the mind of God and cause of all Creation. Because they simply don't care enough to discover it.

<p>
	Amazingly numerical infinities have various sizes.
</p>

<p>
	Watch the video, Understanding Absolute Infinity - Part 2, where the work of Georg Cantor is explained.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity is not the same as a numerical infinity. Absolute Infinity doesn't have a size. It is simply reality itself.

<title>Is it true that this Universe wants the best for us?</title>

<p>
	The universe is not indifferent.
</p>

<p>
	But also the universe has much bigger plans than merely keeping every being physically safe.
</p>

<p>
	The universe prioritzes freedom above physical safety.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're not understanding it is because you're trying to understand the selfless mind of God using your selfish mind. That cannot work. Your view of death and suffering is biased by the ego's hatred and fear of both. God doesn't hate, so this is not part of God's ultimate design.
</p>

<p>
	To understand God you must stop hating and fearing things.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There are stages to moral, cognitive, and spiritual development. These stages are consistent across people around the world.
</p>

<p>
	Absolutistic worldviews are lower thanÂ relativistic ones. With development, an absolutistic person will evolve into a relativistic one, but not vice versa. No amount to growth will turn a relativistic person into an absolutist, or a systems thinker into a black and white thinker.
</p>

<p>
	These are not just my opinions. This is scientific research from within developmental psychology. Study it, if you care to understand.

The conservative value set is lower consciousness.Â A conservative'sÂ sense of self is denser and fear greater. A conservative's cognitive and moral development are objectively lower and less truthful.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with false equivalencies and splitting all issues down the middle.
</p>

<p>
	The mid point between slavery and anti-slavery is still backwards.
</p>

<p>
	None of this makes liberals immune to ignorance or self-deception. But relative to conservatives they are 1 stage higher.
</p>

<p>
	Note: remember, these are relative evaluations, not absolute. Spiral Dynamics is a relative model. But politics is a relative matter so it fits.

<p>
	I notice you guys still have not penetrated (excuse the pun) the issue of survival as talked about in myÂ 2 part survival series.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like using sex for pleasure is still survival! Survival is not just about making babies. Survival is about maintaining your self. The desire for intimacy, romance,Â and companionship is all survival.
</p>

<p>
	If a thing in life has any importance to you, you can be sure it's tied to your survival in some elaborate way.
</p>

<p>
	If a thing was irrelevant to your survival, you would not be talking about it, much less having a strong opinion about it.
</p>

<p>
	Opinions and emotions are survival.

<p>
	Realize this: one vs many it itself a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is one. Reality is many. It's both. There is no difference between the two. And there is a difference between the two. Depending on your POV.
</p>

<p>
	Is a dozen eggs one, or many?
</p>

<p>
	Notice the role of relativity in these kinds of questions.

<p>
	I am not stating my views. I am explaining how the culture holds sexuality.
</p>

<p>
	Of course my explanation is stage Blue/Orange because that's what our culture mostly is.
</p>

<p>
	If you wish to transcend this Blue/Orange stage we first need to be honest about it and understand it. Many people want to jump to stage Green love without fully understanding that sex & "love" are survival strategies. And then of course these same Green people end up having terrible relationships and much sex which ends in misery. That's because they fooled themselves into calling their selfish survival strategies "love".
</p>

<p>
	"love" is very tricky. The devil co-opts love so easily.

<p>
	It's not a matter of degrading or not. This is just how the sexual marketplace works for most humans. This is culture and survival.
</p>

<p>
	It does not have to be this way in the future. But today this is the cultural reality.
</p>

<p>
	When we talk about culture we are talking about averages and trends, so individual exceptions are expected. Just because you might not care about the cultural norms and values does not mean they don't exist.
</p>

<p>
	Most women want to settle down with a man who will be loyal to her. To deny this is silly. This desire to settle down with a man is a survival strategy.

<p>
	The shadow is simply all those aspects of the universe (self) which you have denied in order to maintain a limited human ego self. Yes, to fully embrace yourself as the whole universe you must now re-own those denied aspects of yourself. So that you may finally be complete. You must unify all the divisions your mind has created since your birth. For most people this is a difficult process because there is so much of the universe they have hated and demonized for so long. Now it must be admitted that all that hatred and demonetization was self-hatred and falsehood.

	See video: Understanding Absolute Infinity - Part 2 wherein is discussed Georg Cantor's set theory, which explains how multiple infinities work.
</p>

<p>
	There is an infinite number of different sizes of infinity. Which all adds up to one Absolute Infinity.

<p>
	Sure. Devilry tends to have many reasons, all of which boil down to survival and fear.

<title>Who's Interested In Conscious Politics?</title>

</p>

<p>
	I'm glad he's exploring Wilber's work, but Michael Brooks still doesn't understand the significance of Wilber's work and what Spiral Dynamics / developmental psychology means for politics.
</p>

<p>
	Michael is in high stage Green, but he's a bit too attached to Marxism, socialism, and the progressive movement to move into Tier 2. He's still operating at Tier 1 thinking. It's fine, but there's a higher level.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Michael makes valid critiques of the IDW and conservatives. But there are also important critiques of Marxism which he is missing. For example, one of the biggest critiques of Marx is his materialism. Materialism is false. Marx actually bastardized Hegel. Marx took Hegel's masterpiece philosophy -- which was idealist and quasi-nondual -- and lowered it by turning it materialistic and atheistic.
</p>

<p>
	A political philosophy based on materialism and atheism cannot possibly work in the long term. It will be fundamentally limited by misunderstanding the true metaphysics of reality.
</p>

<p>
	The whole trick with going to the highest levels of politics is being extremely careful not to get hung up on any pet ideology, whether Marxist, capitalist, or whatever. All ideology is limited and partial. Tier 2 politics is going beyond ideology.
</p>

<p>
	For Michael to move into Tier 2, he'd have to go through a painful process of dropping stage Green. This won't serve his immediate survival agenda as a political analyst.
</p>

<p>
	He's still a bit too intellectually arrogant to move into Tier 2. He'll need some mystical experiences to open him up and humble him.
</p>

			Can you explain this point?Â  Do you mean sex workers, rather than sluts.Â 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	What's to explain?
</p>

<p>
	Everyone knows that women who have lots of casual sex are shamed and looked down upon as sluts.
</p>

<p>
	Why does this happen?
</p>

<p>
	Because the woman's value within society is directly related to her locking down a loyal man. If a woman is unable to do this, society thinks there's something wrong with her, like she's broken.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all of this is silly in the absolute sense. But in the relative world of survival it's a big deal. A woman cannot be seen as a slut because then no man will want to lock her down. Which hurts her survival ability. A woman's survival is significantly increased by locking down a responsible man.
</p>

<p>
	A woman who sleeps around a lot cannot be trusted by her man because he can't be sure if their kid is actually his. Women need to reassure men that their children are the man's children and no one else's. This is why men tend to be controlling of women. The man needs to be sure his wife isn't sleeping around behind his back because it can cost him enormously if she does so. In the past, such transgressions were punishable by death in many parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
	When a child is born, women go out of their way to say, "Oh look, he looks just like Daddy!" as as a subtle way of reassuring her man that "Look, this is really your kid, not someone else's."
</p>

<p>
	Sex and relationships are all a sneaky game of survival and manipulation. Automatically so. You're not at all conscious of how or why you're doing it. Rather, it's doing you. You are a marionette to sex.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be so negative.
</p>

<p>
	Society is the most evolved right now than it's ever been in the last 5000 years. The 21st century is a great time to be alive.
</p>

<p>
	Stop worrying, awakening yourself, and go about joyfully awakening society even further.
</p>

<p>
	The world needs your love, hope, vision, and passion.

<p>
	I've found psychedelics to be the best way. What he's bumping up against in his trips is the root of all fear. With dozens more trips the psychedelics should help him see through the illusory nature of all fear and break through to the other side of fear, which is Infinite Self-Love and Self-Acceptance -- Paradise!

<p>
	Great work. That's some quality tripping.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually, as you trip more, you should conquer that sense of going mad and after that it won't be a big deal. You will be able to go even deeper into the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	You are not pure enough yet and your self-understanding is not deep enough yet. You have too much fear which needs to be faced, processed, and put to rest.
</p>

<p>
	Facing madness and facing death are two of the biggest obstacles. But once you conquer those, that's when the tripping gets really profound and life-changing. You need to get as much of your personal crap out of the way as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's imagination happening, creating a relative sense of space.
</p>

<p>
	You are using the mind to compare thing A to thing B and then taking that difference as space. But where is that "space" located? Nowhere. Nowhere is infinite, so it is everywhere, giving the illusion of space. But there is no elsewhere but HERE and NOW. All places are NOW yet nowhere, thus allowing an infinite number of hidden dimensions to reality. Since everywhere is nowhere, all beings can be tucked away inside it, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
	There can literally be an infinite number of universes taking place right on top of each other, so to speak. Since they are all nowhere. That's the beauty of nowhere: it is unlimited.
</p>
