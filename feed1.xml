<p>
	Treating all of mankind as a holon is not some crazy idea. All of mankind has one common ancestor. Basic evolutionary theory treats man as a holon regardless of what island they live on.

<p>
	Like I said, it's a matter of your perspective.
</p>

<p>
	I jump to relativity because it's a deep feature of all these problems and debates. Once you really grasp relativity you will stop this kind of silly hairsplitting. You'll just be at peace knowing it's all a matter of relative perspective.

<p>
	Grasp so deeply that it's all relative that your mind just shuts up and sits in silence.

	This is fake stuff that you will not sustain, and it is OBVIOUSLY done purely for the ego.

<p>
	What do you think all those tattoos are? Ego
</p>

<p>
	And that dude is on HGH and steroids to look that cut.
</p>

<p>
	Basically you can assume that every professional gym rat is on steroids. It's just a scam to sell you wannabes a fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Even Joe Rogan is on HGH and God knows what other drugs. It's all fake shit. The whole industry is designed to prey on insecure men's egos.
</p>

<p>
	Ego. Ego. Ego. Ego. Ego. That's what these people are posing for.
</p>

<p>
	They sell you these poses because you think it will make girls like you. But the truth is, deep down you hate yourself and you suck with girls for much deeper reasons.

<p>
	Of course that's the end goal. The challenge is how to get there. You cannot tell an inexperienced virgin to "just BE attractive".
</p>

<p>
	RSD has always taught to "just BE attractive", but they give you practical ways to work towards that if you suck. And almost all of us start out sucking real bad.
</p>

<p>
	When you are a newbie you gotta be a serious try-hard. It won't look natural. But over time it will become natural.

<p>
	Some parallels I supposed. Israel's strategy is to squeeze them out until they are left with nothing and its too late for them to get any land back. It's like a slow bulldozer strategy masked by public building projects. Like slowly building into your neighbor's land so when your neighbor notices its too late because you've already got a bunch of your stuff there and its too hard to move back.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if your neighbor had a deliberate strategy to take over your land by slowly planting more and more oak trees deeper into your territory while didn't have the power to cut any of the trees down. And finally he will plant the trees right under your house. You try to complain to the police but the police cannot do anything because "it's just trees".

	Possible, but not likely.

<p>
	And even if you do it, it probably won't be a deep realization.

<p>
	Of course he will not agree that his version of good is ego. But that's his ego talking.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that Good is an Absolute which cannot be defined and it has nothing to do with human ideas of what is good. Human ideas of what is good is ego.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Good is when you realize that even the Holocaust was good. And JP is not willing to go there. Whatever his ideas of good are, they will be limited and egoic. Absolute Good is an extremely radical thing that an ego cannot handle. Absolute Good is EVERTYHING: sex, money, family, and even murder.
</p>

<p>
	See, if I ask JP if Stalin is Absolute Good, he will say No! And he is wrong.

<p>
	I would challenge you on this. Your notion of constraint is too narrow and limited. Even uncontacted tribes are part of larger society -- even if they don't know it -- because larger society works around those tribes not to disturb them (or it disturbs them). An island is still part of an ecosystem and it won't stay an island forever.
</p>

<p>
	Again, this will be relative to how you wish to draw your boundaries and what kind of perspective you wish to take.

<p>
	This is a warning to anyone who is going to keep engaging in ideological or Game A activity in this thread: if you keep being obviously partisan and ideological, you will get banned.
</p>

<p>
	So watch what you post.
</p>

<p>
	If I see you embroiling people into a Game A debate, you'll be banned.
</p>

<p>
	If you are Israeli and have a horse in this race, think twice before unconsciously defending your country and watch your gaslighting.

<p>
	Game B does not mean both sides are equal or right.
</p>

<p>
	Israel is building internationally-recognized illegal settlements in decade's long effort to push out the Palestinians. This of course leads to outrage and violence. Israeli's long-term goal is ethnically cleanse the region of Palestinians through gradual resettlement until even a two-state solution is impossible. They don't want a two-state solution. They want to just slowly take over the land. This puts Palestinians in an impossible position which guarantees they will attack, which Isreal will then just use to demonize them and hasted the takeover of land. It's a very sneaky political game for land.

<p>
	Yeah, I see your point. You could frame it like that. That's basically one level of abstraction higher than money, sex, science, family, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Of course everything boils down to something like "good". But what JP does not understand is that his definition of good is actually evil. What he calls good is ego/survival. The ego defined "good" as whatever helps it survive. And survival is in a sense the one constant for all of life. But it is not the Absolute, survival is the greatest bias/illusion/delusion that keeps you from realizing God.
</p>

<p>
	Just because there are men living in uncontacted tribes does not in any way break the notion of men as a holon. A holon does not require physical contact.

	Again, folks, pay attention to how you are getting trapped in Tier 1 thinking, taking sides, and playing Game A rather than Game B.
</p>

<p>
	I expect a more elevated discourse from self-actualizers.

<p>
	Notice how your survival biases are skewing your politics in a selfish way.

	It's all about the defense mechanisms. As long as you don't trigger them you are okay, but as soon as you start triggering them his mind will close all the way down. Because it's not about truth for him, it's about his self-preservation.

	You can still use my work of course, but you have to be extra careful and picky about how to apply it and which parts apply to you.

<p>
	If you have a rare mental condition that only 1% of people have, how can you just expect someone like me to cater to you? I can't cater to every edge case that exists, there are too many of them.

<p>
	It can work but you have to be funny and confident about it. If you're just saying things in a needy and meek way to get her to like you, that will not work.
</p>

<p>
	The rule is: say things which YOU think are funny. Don't say things to impress her. Amuse yourself when you are with her.
</p>

			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A high value guy is not about how much money you have, it's how strong your personality is. If you are humorous and non-needy, you become a high value guy.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously if you work at Starbucks you should not be making jokes about working at Wall Mart. Find other jokes.

			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are not thinking deeply enough about attraction. You think some funny line will make her attracted. That's a mistake. That's not how it works. Attraction is a holistic feeling she gets by being exposed to a strong personality.
</p>

<p>
	There is no magic line or joke that will make her attracted.
</p>

<p>
	You can get attraction with some girls within 3 seconds just by how you look at her, without saying a word.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is more about your vibe than what you say. The words you say matter little. What matter is how you behave and carry yourself around her.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

				E.g > Yesterday I spoke to a cute staff in this shop, but I wasn't really actively intentionally flirting because I actually wanted to buy something, but I did lots of eye contact & I sort of made fun of myself saying but in a less obvious way saying "I'm a wannabe superhero guy" basically, & I noticed she sorted of laughed & smiled, I wonder if this is connected to what you were saying. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	If you can make her laugh, that's always a good thing. But also, do it in a way where you seem strong and powerful, rather than weak. She shouldn't be feeling sorry for you but respect you as a genuine man.

				But I'm confused as to wheter she'd be attracted because on the one hand I was making her laugh a lot & good eye contact but also being kinda needy I think, (Because I am) by talking too much to her for too long & probably sharing too much about myself, although maybe this isn't needy maybe it was natural I'm not sure. 
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

<p>
	Well, you need to cut out all signs of neediness while keeping the humor.

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>

		<ul>

				So could the making her laugh + making fun of myself outweigh the needy behaviours I exuded? As in can your positive characterists be enough to attract a girl in spite of something like being a bit neeedy?
			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You don't need to be perfect for a girl to get attracted or even sleep with you. It's just that the better you are the higher you percentages will be. Girls will give you some leeway. They don't require perfection from you, so relax.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Fake it till you make it. Don't grovel before girls. Act like you are the prize, not her.
</p>

<p>
	Act cocky.
</p>

<p>
	For example, a cocky line I love to use is, "Hey, has anyone ever told you how beautiful [pause] I am?"
</p>

			</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course you will be needy until you start getting lots of success. In the meantime just try to contain the worse manifestation of your neediness. It's okay to be needy on the inside for now. Just don't show it to her. Don't act desperate.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can think about her, but don't call or text her too much. Hold yourself back. Less is more.
</p>

<p>
	Work on suppressing all outer signs of your neediness. Inner neediness can only be cured by getting some results. But the girl does not know about your inner neediness, all she knows is what you express outwardly. So just hold your shit in.
</p>

<p>
	Download a metronome app for your phone.
</p>

<p>
	Turn on it on and follow every tick and tock with your mind. If your mind wanders, bring it back to the tick and tock. Keep doing that until your mind becomes focused and clear.
</p>

<p>
	Binural beats are also very good for just calming down a noising mind.

<p>
	That's a nice excuse to mask over the true reason's your doing it: to have a better self-image.
</p>

<p>
	You can develop some strength without bulging muscles. And you can get a satisfied feeling with moderate exercise. You don't need to be pushing giant weights.

<p>
	There is no evil. That is just your selfishness projected out onto the world. That's your shadow.
</p>

<p>
	Hamas is simply the equivalent of the Israeli military. It serves exactly the same function: self-defense of its people.

<p>
	I understand it at a high level. But I don't get myself involved with the nitty-gritty of dealing with it. How to deal with it is a complex and messy business which I have no interest in. Abnormal and dysfunctional psychology is a narrow specialization that requires lots of clinical experience to manage well. That's not my wheelhouse.

	Yes, of course. That's exactly what New Agers, psychics, healers, clairvoyants, mystics, and shamans do. Most of them are like that from birth, and they spend many years struggling with how to control, make sense of it, and put it to use.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The problem here is CONTEXT.
</p>

<p>
	Flashy game requires EXTREME CONTEXT AWARENESS.
</p>

<p>
	When you pull off a move like groping a girl's tits, you must be damn sure she is attracted to you, it is in a socially permissible place (like a nightclub), and you must do it in a non-creepy way.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of me doing that, I first ask her for verbal permission.
</p>

<p>
	"OMG! Your boobs are amazing! May I squeeze them?"
</p>

<p>
	She giggles and says, "Yes"
</p>

<p>
	Then you squeeze away.
</p>

<p>
	This is not nice guy behavior. This is boss behavior. If you can pull that off, you've got some serious skill. There is no way a creepy newbie can pull that off with a hot girl. That requires hundreds of hours of practice and attunement to her emotional state and the social context. You would never do such a thing at a cafe during the daytime.
</p>

<p>
	When you are very experienced with game, there's a lot of outrageous stuff you can get away with. But not as a creepy, awkward, inexperienced newbie. Situational awareness requires years of experience to dial in.
</p>

<p>
	Well-calibrated, non-creepy physical escalation is an art form.
</p>

Hence your reality is less solid and more spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	This is quite common.
</p>

<p>
	You basically have natural psychedelics in your head all the time. The anti-psychotics dampen that down, making you more grounded, like a normie.

<p>
	Pretty much. Why would you want bulging muscles? Only to feed your self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
	But exercise for health is not ego. But exercise for health will not give you bulging muscles. It will make you fit and lean.

			<br />
			<strong>Do you plan to make videos explaining more about how to navigate the psychedelic experience? </strong><br />
			<br />
			It would be helpful to know the best ways (or simply your best recommendation) to navigate things like:
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>-In a mushroom trip:</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			How to capture the change in music from what it was, to the immediate direct message, to you in particular, from God. (pre-transpersonal)<br />
			<br />
			When someone asks, "how you doin" and you get that endless pointless feeling like "chillin" is a melancholic lie.<br />
			<br />
			When life feels like a joke that you're the butt of.<br />
			<br />
			When your identity and survival seems like the ultimate mockery and death is the answer. (surrender?)
		</p>

		<p>
			Losing consciousness (or connection with the body/reality/visual/motor) or going to a grey identity-less static love-snow place, or having a "seizure"
		</p>

		<p>
			What to do when the experience becomes overwhelming, or the circumstances become less than ideal outside your control. (intruders, animals, accidents, realizing misuse mid-trip)
		</p>

		<p>
			How to emotionally or logically navigate urges like: "Are my parents okay? and should I call them right now?" ; "Am I physically dying?" ; "do I need EMS?" ; "Will anyone understand?" ; "Is this gutter-punk the devil?" ; "Why can't I find comfort without dying?" ; "Can I die without dying?" ; "Should I make myself vomit? Will it lessen this intense comeup?" and others.
		</p>

	Lol, how do you come up with this craziness?
</p>

<p>
	My mind doesn't work like that.

I often get an urge, but then hold myself back. It can be very tempting to intellectually rip someone apart. But if you're conscious and introspect for a second, you'll recognize it as ego.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why I've adopted a general policy of not debating anyone. I don't want to be lured into such egoic games. If you refuse to debate, you automatically win.

	Both are effectively ethnic cleansing, just at different scales.

<p>
	I wasn't talking about Yellow debates, I was talking about looking at debates from a Yellow stage yourself. If YOU don't bring the Yellow to the debate, you won't find it there.
</p>

<p>
	Debates are not a Yellow activity. Yellow people got better things to do than debate.

<title>Is Spiral Dynamics a strange loop?</title>

<p>
	It's not a strange loop, it's a SPIRAL! A spiral is a loop that keeps moving upward.
</p>

<p>
	Aubrey does all his trips with shamans in the rain forest. Of course he's gonna have that shamanic, tribal vibe. I see nothing special in that. Does that help him integrate stage Purple? I would bet. It's hard to learn Purple in the modern world, you really gotta go live in a remote tribe.

<title>Vaush's Discussion with Epoch Philosophy on the Merits of Debate Culture</title>

<p>
	I'd say the biggest value of debates is that they at least expose you to different worldviews, as opposed to just being in an echo-chamber. It can be revealing, for example, to see how a Nazi or a libertarian thinks. Seeing his thought process is valuable and useful as you learn epistemology. You can catch the epistemic mistakes and learn from them.
</p>

<p>
	Debates have to be watched from a stage Yellow, meta perspective. Most people fall into the trap of watching debates from a Tier 1 perspective of picking a side.
</p>

<p>
	If you're going to watch a debate, you should approach it like a scientist observes chimps in the wild. Don't become the chimp.
</p>

<p>
	There are no rules to this. You can't predict when it will happen.
</p>

<p>
	Most people will need 100+ awakenings I think because your psyche is just too impure to handle it. Each trip purifies your blockages a bit. And also, because you cannot integrate that much wisdom, insight, and understanding in just a few trips. You will probably need YEARS of integration work just to clear up your mind.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The practical answer is that if you have not done 100 breakthrough trips on various substances, you have no clue what consciousness really is.
</p>

<p>
	So very practically: set your goal to do 100 breakthrough trips at least. But pace it out slowly over years, with proper time to integrate everything. Go at a comfortable pace, but also, don't stop because you think you got it all. You have certainly not got it all.
</p>

<p>
	Do not fall into the Alan Watts trap of saying that "Once you get the message, hang up the phone." This is very bad advice. The psychedelic space is so deep, so rich, so complex -- that without 100 trips you're just like a baby taking your first steps. Don't try to rush this process. Make it a slow, patient life-long exploration and expansion process. You need to adopt a long-view rather than just hoping to get it over with. Enjoy it. Don't even think about reaching the end, just think about going deeper. Explore Yourself! And don't let anyone shame you for doing so. Explore Yourself so deeply that all your questions are answered. If you still have unanswered questions, you're not done. And if you have no unanswered questions, you're not asking enough questions.
</p>

<p>
	Stop worrying about being done. If it ever happens, it will happen on its own. Explore without any pressure on yourself to finish.
</p>

<title>Who Wants A 2-hr Jordy P Analysis Video?</title>

<p>
	JP does criticize extremism on the right. The problem is that he does not talk at all about the dangers of the normal right-wing. The problem is not merely the neo-Nazis and conspiracy theorists. The problem is that like 80% of the Republican party denies basic reality and facts and gaslights like crazy and have very regressive policies. And there is a rise of right-wing authoritarianism and nationalist movements all over the world. Yet JP is crying about SJWs.
</p>

<p>
	It's a mis-assessment of the real threats to democracy.
</p>

<p>
	SJWs did not threaten US democracy. The right-wing did. JP has to answer for how he got it so wrong. It's not the Post-Modernists who stormed the US Capitol, it's people who gravitate towards JP's stage Blue teachings and bitterness towards SJWs.
</p>

<p>
	JP exaggerates the threats of SJWs and ignores the very real threats of the right-wing: not the radicals, but even the more normal ones. For example, why does he appear on PragerU and FoxNews, both horrible and untruthful propaganda machines? This is not proper for a serious intellectual to do. He does not speak out against them nearly enough.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like PragerU, FoxNews, OAN, and NewsMax are arguably the most toxic and corrupting force in US politics. It's way worse than anything universities do. Yet you will not hear any of this listening to JP, you will hear about how bad SJWs are.

<p>
	If you actually bother to read Godel's dialogues and personal letters (which I did) you would learn that Godel was profoundly metaphysical and sharply criticized the non-metaphysical rationalists of his day as being mindless and clueless. Godel was a Platonist. Godel's thinking extended far beyond any strict logic proofs. But to a mindless rationalist only a strict logic proof of anything counts. They simply refuse to consider or think deeply about any implications by saying, "But it's not in the formal proof, so it's just woo-woo stuff".
</p>

<p>
	But the entire point of Godel's theorems was to prove that Truth cannot be captured by any proof!
</p>

<p>
	There are also more generalized proofs with Tarksi's Incomplete Theorem. But the rationalists have no interest in such things.
</p>

<p>
	They simply have no interest in connecting the dots, and as soon as they see someone connecting the dots they cry, "New Age mumbo jumbo!" and think they are being rational. This is exactly the kind of thinking Godel warned against.
</p>

	You don't need to retain it. Feelings come and go. Just the knowingness is enough. You don't need to be in a constant love high.

<p>
	It is not a matter of loving Hitler in the way you might love your children. It's a metaphysical matter of realizing that Hitler is part of Universal Love.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, don't make a shadow of anything.

<p>
	All that self-doubt and fear is totally normal. You need to paint hopeful visions for your future to inspire yourself. Stop wallowing in negative thoughts and reorient your mind towards those aspects of reality which make you feel love and inspiration. And keep doing that ever day without quitting.

<p>
	The solution is to get serious about life. Realize your life is short, so get to the hard work of living it passionately. You need to realign your life to fit your values. So hatch a plan and then get to work on it. Even a half-baked plan is better than no plan at all.
</p>

<p>
	That feeling is important. Don't try to suppress it, rather listen what it is telling you: "Hey! Silly human! Your life is out of alignment with your values. Warning! Warning!"

	For me it is more powerful than 5-MeO. Too powerful. Unbearable, suicidal levels of consciousness. Imagine a beauty so infinite it makes you want to kill yourself because you cannot stand to look at it.

He's another example of a Yellow Game B thinker who is at times openly hostile towards the excesses of Green, and I can't sense whether it's because he has a Green shadow or if he's just being his blunt bombastic self. Either way, I really enjoy his conversations as he comes off as some normal dude sitting on the porch shooting the shit but from a stage Yellow perspective.

<p>
	I have not heard of him before.

<p>
	The problem with hostility towards Green is that Green is our next stage for the next 50 years collectively. Is it wise to be hostile towards the next step mankind must take?

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The dictionary definition of omniscience is essentially correct.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is that your knowing is so profound that it cannot be put into words, nor logic, nor equations -- it is fully embodied at the material level. For example, you know your hands by HAVING hands, not by thinking about them. So it's closer to BEING than knowing some conceptual facts or scientific information.
</p>

<p>
	And the other trick to it is that the ego cannot control it -- as the materialist always desires to do. So you are omniscient but there is no ego who can manipulate this omniscience for personal gain. You won't be guessing any lottery numbers because the lottery and numbers themselves are obviously imaginary and silly.
</p>

<p>
	Furthermore, you are so conscious that things like "scientific facts" no longer exist. Nor will you necessarily be conscious of stuff like how many particles of sand exist on Earth, because at this level of consciousness you are aware that particles of sand and the Earth itself are just imaginings of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	You will be omniscient only of your bubble of consciousness -- because that's all there ever was. So this materialist idea of: "Well if you're omniscient why can't you read my mind?" won't work because you're too conscious for the existence of other minds.
</p>

<p>
	Omniscience is not very useful from the ego's POV. And there's a good reason for that. Once you become omniscient you will realize that reality has always been perfect and there is no need to change anything. The desire to "improve" reality via omniscience turns out to be nothing but materialist idiocy and ego fantasies. The design is already perfect. You just surrender to it. You do not start dicking around with it to suit yourself. And if you are so selfish as to desire to dick around with it, you will never access omniscience. The cost of admission is your desire to control or improve anything.
</p>

	You will laugh at how silly you were to be afraid of them.

<p>
	Stick to small doses.

<p>
	Unless you are stupid or have a mental illness, there is no reason to fear small doses.

<p>
	1g of mushrooms will not harm anyone.

<p>
	Mostly people get in trouble because they take way too much. 4g of mushrooms will shows you what madness feels like.

<p>
	Green can also be like that.
</p>

<p>
	Bret has a much better grasp of Green than, say, JP. I would place Bret higher than just Orange. I think he's Green in many ways. Just in a more sober and rational way.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Jamie is way beyond that. He is a student of Ken Wilber.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Wrong.
</p>

<p>
	1) You do not need to have any illness to not be able to flush out heavy metals. It varies by genetics but even a fully health person can fail to filter them out well. Your natural flush rate varies from as low as 40% to as high as 90%. This assumes you're healthy. If you are unhealthy your rate could be lower.
</p>

<p>
	2) Even if you genetics are perfect, you will still never flush out all heavy metals you consume, and they will accumulate in your brain and organs, and never leave. The only question is at what rate they accumulate. The more of them you consume the faster the rate. And once they enter your brain and organs there is no way to get them out other than serious detox protocols and also by eliminating further consumption.
</p>

<p>
	Heavy metals are never listed in the ingredients.
</p>

<p>
	You are getting too technical with your definition of experience. I am using it causually here, inclusive of Being.
</p>

<p>
	Experience = Being + ego.
</p>

<p>
	When ego is removed from the equation, experience is absolutized.
</p>

<p>
	Just different ways of saying it.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to absolutize your experience of life. Make your experience Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Exactly. You have multiple personality disorder and you keep reinforcing it with your dualistic logic.

<p>
	Multiple personality disorder does not mean there are actually many personalities. It means you are hallucinating all the personalities and tricking yourself into buying the illusion.

<p>
	What you see is all there ever is. Period. End of story.
</p>

<p>
	Your consciousness is Absolute. Nothing can be hidden from view.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is that it's too radical for you to accept.
</p>

<p>
	All objections to this are just a distraction created by the ego to weasel it's way out of accepting the obvious.
</p>

<p>
	You can keep creating distractions, or you can bite the bullet and realize you are God.
</p>

<p>
	Skepticism is not your friend here. Be ware the trap of skepticism.

<p>
	I am not saying his tears are fake. Of course he feels love and passion. Hitler felt love and passion. We all do.
</p>

<p>
	But the love is biased and limited by his level of consciousness, fear, and egoic construction.
</p>

<p>
	I mean that if JP truly opened his heart he would stop all railing against SJWs. He would laugh at himself and how silly and lacking in empathy he was.
</p>

<p>
	It is literally just a lack of understanding, consciousness, and love caused by a dense ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue has love. But stage Green has more love.

<p>
	Actually you got it backwards: 100% of all experiences are absolutely true.
</p>

<p>
	Since experience of any kind is Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you see Jesus, then you saw Jesus. Now, what you think that means is a whole nother matter. Jesus is imaginary, just like everything else.

<p>
	It is never enough to just do a psychedelic. What really matters is whether one is eager to deconstruct one's reality. And obviously JP is not eager to do that. So psychedelics will be threatening to such a mind.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are JP's kryptonite.

	You guys seem to really not get this: your highest intelligence will not come from social interactions, it will come solo, all alone. Socializing with people tends to make you dumber, not wiser.
</p>

<p>
	I've read literally over 100,000 comments of me and giving me feedback. So if you think I'm just locked into my own bubble, you're nuts. I take all feedback seriously from day 1.

<p>
	I didn't make anything personal. There is a profound absence of proper analysis of Jordan Peterson's teachings on YT. People from the left and right are both being deceived about him and are not being properly guided towards the highest understanding they could have of reality. That's where I come in. My only function in life is to help people understand. That's all I do. And it doesn't matter the subject or person or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	I held back from doing a JP video for 3 years because I didn't want it to look like I was just talking about him for clicks.
</p>

<p>
	I was very concerned about the stage Green shadow that JP fans were implicitly absorbing by watching his talks.

	That is one butt-hurt stage Orange ego writing that article.

<p>
	It's like he fell off a cliff and hit every branch of the stage Orange tree flat on his face.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This is such an absurd framing for 3 reasons:
</p>

<p>
	1) All spiritual work is gradual. You might as well argue, why would anyone ever want to go to a meditation retreat to only awaken part time?
</p>

<p>
	NOBODY awakens in one single shot. This is pure nonsense myths.
</p>

<p>
	2) Time is an illusion. So the idea that a psychedelic awakening is "impermanent" or "temporary" is purely a delusion of the ego-mind. A psychedelic awakening is Absolute, and the Absolute does not care how long it lasts in human time. A psychedelic awakening is timeless and Eternal, even if it only lasts "15 minutes" in human time. Stop conflating time with truth. 1 second is as true as 1 million years.
</p>

<p>
	3) To claim that psychedelic trips do not grow you is absurd and contradicts all the science on psychedelics.
</p>

	Especially protein powder. Protein powders can be straight up poison.
</p>

<p>
	All powders highly concentrate heavy metals and toxins.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine taking 50 gallons of milk and boiling it down to 1 lb of powder. That's a 50x increase in heavy metal concentration.

<p>
	I fully encourage you to listen to other spiritual teachers. I have no desire to monopolize your mind.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know who has equal amount of understanding and frankly I don't care. You should stop trying to equate people and just appreciate many diverse perspectives. You don't need some ultimate one perspective or teacher, what you need is many diverse sources which you will integrate into your own master understanding.

			The weird thing about autism is that you're not technically unable to<em> feel </em>empathy like a sociopath, you're just unable to understand why you should feel empathy in certain situations, because you can't read social cues very well. It also has to do with deficits in understanding theory of mind on a pure cognitive level. So feeling vs. understanding.

<title>How do you 'resolve' extreme dualities? How do you integrate polar opposites?</title>

<p>
	It is a foolish mistake to automatically assume the truth is the mid-point between any two given positions.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is required to adjudicate and resolve between such things with wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	A true decision requires you to cut off one possibility entirely from another. There is a deep power in saying NO to a thing. It is liberating.
</p>

<p>
	In your situation you should not look for the middle way, you should look for the right way. The right way is whichever aligns with your genuine passions and values.
</p>

<p>
	You lack clarity on your values -- that's what makes such decisions difficult. So clarify your values.
</p>

<p>
	You can also experiment with both forks of the road before making your final decision. You can live 1 year in a cave and you can spend 1 year chasing sex and money. And then see which one you like better.
</p>

<p>
	You also make a plan such as: I will work on business and sex for the next 5 years. Then I will retire to a cave for 2 years. Then I will return back to society and live as a householder and run a business.
</p>

	The problem with that is, then his audience already knows most of what I will say, and there is little point preaching to the chior. It's too easy to preach to the chior.

<p>
	Awakening is a total surrender to God's infinite intelligence. You stake your life on it. Instead of using ego to keep you safe, God keeps you safe.
</p>

<p>
	God has had your back this whole time, but you were too afraid to trust it. Silly devil.

<p>
	It's not about comparing me to anyone.
</p>

<p>
	It's about guiding you to the deepest consciousness possible. You will not reach the deepest consciousness using their weak sauce. I'm very serious about this. I don't give a rats ass about being better than those people. What I care about is you getting stuck at some nothingness or no-self state.

<p>
	Nonduality is not full God-realization. All paths do not lead to the same place.

<p>
	There exists a place of Infinite Consciousness. If you dare, I will meet you there.

<p>
	As I've told you, you must think for yourself, listen to your highest self, follow your heart, and customize life to you. 
</p>

<p>
	It's called SELF-actualization,
</p>

<p>
	Not LEO-actualization.
</p>

<p>
	Don't actualize me, actualize YOU!
</p>

<p>
	This requires a lot more courage than aping Leo like a blind chimp.
</p>

<p>
	When the finger points at the moon, don't look at the finger, look at the moon.
</p>

<p>
	Customize, customize, customize! If you don't care about truth, follow what you do care about. My LP Course is all about helping you find your top values, not my top values.

	Science is not innocent. It's full of bullshit and without its deconstruction you will never realize you are God.

<p>
	Every moment is Absolute and Eternal but this Eternity is always in motion.
</p>

<p>
	Eternal does not mean static or unchanging, it means outside of the illusion of time.
</p>

<p>
	My hands are moving but they are not moving in time, time is just a projection on top of them that is being imagined.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize the future and past are imaginary, the present moment is radically recontextualized as Absolute and undying.

	Ein Sof is Zen satori and Buddhist cessation. It's just Nothingness.

<p>
	Sam Harris would be the most difficult person to talk to by far. That rationalism, scientism, and atheism would be denser than a lead brick. He would be stubborn like a mule and his mind is so crafty and smart that he would have a perfect excuse for every point made. Deconstructing his mind would be impossible.
</p>

<p>
	A sharp rationality in the hands of the ego-mind is the most dangerous thing. It will try to out-lawyer you in ways you cannot imagine. I am not a magician in such matters. I expect people to want to open their minds, not to have to twist their nipple into it.
</p>

<p>
	The thing with Sam Harris is, if you can't out-logic him on his terms, you automatically lose. Because that's the whole game him and his entire audience is playing. If it isn't perfectly logical they will declare victory. My mind does not even work in such stupidly logical ways.
</p>

<p>
	For me to be logical is big step down in my intelligence.
</p>

	No, it's way more beautiful than that. It feels like the entire Universe is alive as you and constructing itself on-the-fly. It is not some static thing that exists in the past and pre-set in a boring stale way. It's alive and magical.

<p>
	You are Infinite Love. There's no need for compassion once you realize what you are and there is no one but yourself to be compassionate towards. So you just fall in love with yourself. Which is just to say you ARE Love.
</p>

<p>
	You feel Love so deeply it kills you. Death by Love.

<p>
	I elaborated it to Charlie. God is Love and all of its will goes towards creating Love. So even God does not really have free will, although it does but it was all given to Love. In the end you have no control over anything at all, you just surrender to Love.

<p>
	Yeah, well, those people aren't fully awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Compassion for other beings is what actually keeps you from the final awakening. There are no other beings, of course. It was just more illusion you created to act spiritual.

<p>
	My video is actually exceedingly generous to JP. I will probably get flack from progressives more than his fans.
</p>

<p>
	But who knows? You can never predict such things. People can react in all sorts of unexpected ways.
</p>

<p>
	I am often surprised by how people react to my videos.
</p>

<p>
	It's also not clear to me how open his fans are. How many of them are MAGA nutcases vs normal reasonable folk? Unknown.

<p>
	If I talk to him I would have to confront him on fundamental issues like Truth, Love, Consciousness, God, relativity, etc. This would threaten him very much and I have no idea how he would handle it and how I would handle the reactions.
</p>

<p>
	The conversation could easily devolve into a chain of endless defense mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
	And if I make him look bad, his fans will not be happy.
</p>

<p>
	And in the end, what's in it for me? Pissing people off does little for me. And I don't want to get embroiled in political battles. Talking to him makes me a political target. I don't want Actualized.org to become a political circus or part of the culture wars.

<p>
	Sadhguru, Spira, and Tolle don't say anything of substance. They just give vague allusions to things. I have no interest in such talk.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru, Spira, and Tolle have not taken on the task of deconstructing science or materialism for example, or explaining that you are God. My work is very different from such gurus. My work is much more technical and intellectual. I talk about complex models and metaphysics and epistemology and philosophy and politics, etc. Sadhguru tells stupid stories about Shankara and Pilai.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like Spira also has a very niche audience of hardcore nondualists who he preaches to. And to a general audience he says simple things like close your eyes and feel your awareness. I don't do that kind of stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Tolle does not go to a scientist and try to tell him that his entire worldview is a lie.
</p>

<p>
	Besides, these people are not even fully awake. They could not tell you what God is, and they never have.
</p>

<p>
	Well, I would think that more than 1% of folks comprehended my answers to Charlie. It wasn't exactly rocket science.
</p>

<p>
	Honestly, if one can't understand what I told Charlie, what is the point of following my work?
</p>

<p>
	If it's just a numbers game then the Charlie convo was a success. I would think at least 20% got it.
</p>

<p>
	So the question is, how many people have to get it for it to count as a success? If 1000 people watch Eckhart Tolle and 10 of them convert, does that mean Tolle did well? Can Tolle convert 500 of them?

	The only way to eat cheap is basically a lot of empty carbs/sugar.
</p>

<p>
	Veggies, fruits, meats, good oils are all expensive.

<p>
	YOU get embodiment because you are deep student of this work. Charlie's audience does not get embodiment. They wil just see a hippie.

<p>
	I once showed a video of Peter Ralston to a guy and told him, "Look this dude is really enlightened." And the guy said, "He looks insane." and that was the end of the conversation.

<p>
	I learned to be more direct and concrete with my responses and examples. My mind is very abstract and most people can't follow the abstractions. They need simple, simple examples -- which are harder for me to generate than abstractions. Generating crystal clear examples on the fly is not easy.
</p>

<p>
	In retrospect, if Charlie ever again asks me, "How do you know you are love? Isn't is just a memory?" I will ask him, "How do you know you were born? Isn't that just a memory? How do you know you have a mother? How do you know orgasms are real?"
</p>

<p>
	Two can play that game.
</p>

<p>
	See, responses like that would tighten up the conversation. But it's not so easy to whip out pithy responses like that which stop a silly question dead in the water. Generating such pithy responses is actually not a casual conversation, it's very laser targeted and premeditated. You have to anticipate how the question will place you into a long multi-threaded explanatory chain and cut it off at the root by flipping it back on the questioner. It is more like verbal combat.

<p>
	I have no idea. I have not heard anything negative. I assumed Charlie was happy with it. But who knows.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, his Orange audience will turn on him if he goes too far into Turquoise/mysticism. They will eat him alive. So these types of interview could earn him some backlash. Anyone who associates with my ideas too much will face backlash from normies: "How dare you invite his lunatic to your show! I trusted you."

	That's only one factor. Another factor is that they are selfish and self-biased, which means they vote only based on what personally serves them.

<p>
	A stage Orange person's worldview is commonly all about unchecked capitalism. The more she benefits from unchecked capitalism and materialism the more that worldview will feel true and real.

	Jenner is entitled and materialistic as fuck. Of course she doesn't care about helping poor people by deconstructing capitalism. Her entire run for gov is just a personal publicity stunt, like Kanye West and Trump. That's how these people operate. They don't give a fuck about actually doing good governance. To them this job is a way to be famous and grift off the fame.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course Infinite Self-Understanding.
</p>

<p>
	I would say the biggest thing is that your consciousness becomes "Absolutized". By which I mean, everything you are conscious of is seen as existing absolutely and eternally. For example, right now as I type this and look at my hands, I know for a fact that my hands are Absolute. My hands exist for Eternity. My hands are God's hands. I exist Eternally and I will never die.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't claim to be above Jesus. I am Jesus and everything else in the Universe.
</p>

<p>
	When you fully awaken you will realize that performing miracles is unnecessary because that assumes reality isn't already perfect. If you assume for a minute that reality as you see it is and has always been absolutely perfect, then the idea that you should interfere with the flow of reality in order to manipulate it with miracles can be seen as a delusion. It's ego who thinks that miracles ought to be performed because ego is unable to see that what is already the case is perfect. Ego actually believes it can improve reality, which is pure hogwash. You can't make reality any more perfect than God has. This is the core arrogance and delusion of the ego. The ego wants powers to manipulate reality to suit itself. But God-realization is the death of that ego. The ego does not end up with special powers. The ego is killed so deeply that it never even existed.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, actually you're very wrong about that.
</p>

<p>
	If you actually became infinitely conscious you would realize that making the state permanent is an egoic desire and that you do not want the state to be permanent precisely because God-mode is so boring. You didn't become a human by accident. You decided to become a human because it was in the higher Good and because you are playing an Eternal game of hide and seek.
</p>

<p>
	You think you want infinite power, but once you get it, you will realize that existence becomes totally meaningless and pointless. And thus you will decide to lower your state of consciousness -- to fall asleep -- so that you could struggle to awaken again.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot awaken without falling asleep. And God cannot be all-powerful unless it is capable of putting itself to sleep. God definitely puts itself to sleep and this is not a fault or error within God. It is the very structure of what God is. God is an infinite dreamer. God is not just the highest state of consciousness, God is all lower states of consciousness too!
</p>

<p>
	Your idea is to lock God down into the highest state of consciousness. But this is precisely a mistake which would limit Infinite Consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is you do not understand what you're asking for because you are not infinitely consciousness. If you dislike the lower states, you misunderstand God. You are not understanding the depth of the Love because your ego is still biased and selfish. You only want the highest love, not the lowest. But Absolute LOVE must include the lowest.

	These ideas will only make sense to the right audience. I cannot take a room full of clueless, closedminded materialists and convince them of anything spiritual. To attempt such feats is an exercise in stupidity and demeaning to my intelligence.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's exactly what makes a conversation confusing.
</p>

<p>
	If I let the conversation just go anywhere, nothing would be understood at all. Letting someone pepper you with random questions about God is a recipe for disaster.
</p>

<p>
	Let me try to pepper you with random rapid-fire questions like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Does God exist?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do you know?
	</li>
	<li>
		But what if you're deluded?
	</li>
	<li>
		But what if you're hallucinating?
	</li>
	<li>
		Prove it to me
	</li>
	<li>
		But science says there is no God
	</li>
	<li>
		But science says your enlightenment experiences are just brain activity
	</li>
	<li>
		If God exists, why did the Holocaust happen?
	</li>
	<li>
		What if truth is just pragmatism?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	These questions cannot just be asked casually in conversation.
</p>

<p>
	You can't be like, "Relax, just have a casual conversation, bro. Don't worry about anything."
</p>

<p>
	And then be like, "Bro! You didn't explain God in a slam-dunk way like you do in a 3 hr prepared lecture."
</p>

<p>
	A casual conversation meanders and explains little.
</p>

<p>
	If anything I'm getting criticized for being too casual. I was just having a pleasant conversation with Charlie. I was not trying to build a rock solid case for anything. This was not some logical proof I was constructing. He asked me random questions and I answered them with awareness to how my answers would trigger normie defenses. I was not nervous or tense at all. These kind of talks are very easy for me personally. The problem is that a casual convo will not explain Truth to any normie listening in.
</p>

<p>
	If you ask me for a random example of a scientific paradigm change, and I respond with Einstein, this will tell you nothing about why science is fundamentally misguided.
</p>

			<strong>The first law of survival is NOT breathing.</strong> Our bodies allows us to run away from predators and to quickly react to immediate dangers without breathing for a very short time using ATP (our anaerobic system), which is more important to saving our lives and our immediate safety (1st law) than physiological needs (such as food, water, or <strong>breathing</strong>). That is why IMMEDIATE SAFETY (amygdala hijack) is the 1st sub-law of the first law of social fabrics.

<p>
	Well, that assumes you've already got enough air to hold you over. Which means you were breathing to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	But anyway, there's not much point splitting hairs about this. These low level needs are obvious and no one is disputing them. And their precise order is irrelevant since your body handles that stuff for you automatically anyway. It knows the order you need when. The order is gonna be contextual too. You are not going to drink water if you know there's a crocodile right where you drink.

<p>
	When Ramana Maharshi got cancer his followers tried to get doctors to come look at him to heal him. His response was something along the lines of: "Who cares? It's just a body."
</p>

<p>
	When you are that awake you literally don't give a fuck about anything. No condition of life is better than any other.
</p>

<p>
	An fully awakened person cannot die. He is conscious forever, regardless of what happens to his body. So losing the body makes no difference.

<p>
	That's the catch-22 of this business.
</p>

<p>
	On the one hand you guys want me out there talking to people on normie shows.
</p>

<p>
	Then when those normies fail to understand anything or run amok, then you say: Look what you did, Leo!
</p>

<p>
	Pick what you want: 1) Do you want normies to know about God, or 2) Do you not?
</p>

<p>
	If you want normies to know about God, then realize that they will fuck it up badly, as they have for the last 2000 years. Or if you don't, then stop telling me that I should go on Joe Rogan and such.
</p>

	How do you imagine Joe Rogan fans will react to what I teach? They will think I'm insane and they will blame Rogan for having me on. That's how normies react to Truth. I can't fix that. There is no way to make Actualized.org a mainstream accepted teaching. That expectation deeply misunderstands the depth of the epistemic quagmire society is in.

<p>
	God cannot be mainstreamed. Not unless you completely pervert it into falsehood.

	"Becoming a madman" is just a fear you have that keeps you from realizing you're God.

<p>
	They all worked.

</blockquote>

<p>
	There are many degrees of awakening and consciousness. Consciousness can expand or contract without any limitations. How do you think you got unwoke in the first place? If consciousness could not contract, you could not awaken because you'd already be woke and spirituality would not exist since you would be fully conscious that you're God at all times. You also could not be human. You can only be ignorant of things because your consciousness is contracted. Uncontracted consciousness is absolutely omniscient. If you are not aware of how you created every hair on your ass, your consciousness must be contracted. Since you create everything.
</p>

<p>
	Do you honestly think that God does not know how it created the hairs on your ass? If no, you're underestimating God. If yes, then you've separated yourself from God.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not omniscient you are not fully conscious. It's just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	That is not possible because without addressing the confusions and defense mechanisms it will not penetrate the mind.

<p>
	It may feel that way to you, but if you listen to the entire thing, I answered all his questions. It just took some time.
</p>

<p>
	If you ask me a question like, "What are the problems of science?" or "How important were psychedelics in your life?", there is no quick way to answer that such that a normie would get it.

		<p>
			I noticed that you were a lot less explanatory and in depth in this interview than in your usual videos.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Because it is impossible. Charlie would not know what questions to ask in what order to get something like one of my videos.
</p>

<p>
	This is why I rarely do conversations with people. The interviewer does not know the depth of what he is asking. We waste most of the time clearing up confusions and defense mechanisms. To get a conversation as substantial as one of my videos the interviewer would need have a depth of consciousness and knowledge that I have. Such people nearly do not exist. And if they do, they don't have massive YT channels or general audiences.
</p>

<p>
	There is a fundamental limitation in explaining these topics to a general, causal stage Orange audience. No amount of skill can overcome that limitation. The best that can be done is a bit better. But it will never be some homerun that leads to some profound awakening. Conversation is not suited to this work. Which is why I generally avoid it. If I want to explain something serious, having a person asking me question is actually an obstacle.
</p>

<p>
	My videos are as dense and direct as things can get short of a book. Any conversation I have will be less dense because it will meander around and devolve into an infinite chain of follow up question.
</p>

<p>
	Conversations are not lectures. They are just random questions. Imagine trying to learn calculus with little mathematical experience by asking random questions for 2 hours. It's impossible. It would all sound like word salad and woo-woo.
</p>

<p>
	I have spent more time studying these issues than you spent years learning mathematics. And you still suck at math.
</p>

<p>
	And I consider Charlie a good stage Yellow interviewer. Just imagine how bad it would get if I was speaking to a defensive Tier 1 person like Richard Dawkins. It would get real bad. And that's exactly as it should be, because the interviewer and his audience are playing a game of defending their constructions of reality.
</p>

<p>
	What is not understood by people is that a conversation is never a genuine inquiry into truth. Truth cannot be reached via conversation, ever. Because the person you are talking to does not even exist but in your own mind.
</p>

<p>
	If you were conscious of the truth you would not be having a conversation in the first place. Conversations are for entertainment, not truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you expect my podcast appearances to deliver you some epic deep understanding, you should drop that fantasy now because it won't happen. The format does not allow that. If you want some deep understanding of anything I talk about you'll need 10 hrs minimum. Just to understand Spiral Dynamics takes at least 20 hours of study. And that's way easier to understand than something like science or God.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	My only frustration is not enough time.
</p>

<p>
	I enjoyed the conversation. These kind of conversations are very easy for me. The problem is dumbing it down to a level the audience can follow. Dumbing it down in the right way takes a lot of skill and I still need to get better at that.

<p>
	The problem is that the questions Charlie asked were so deep it would require a 5 hr conversation.
</p>

<p>
	Something like deconstructing science just cannot be done in 60 minutes because there are too many defense mechanisms to address.
</p>

<p>
	Deconstructing science would take at least 5 hrs. And we talked about a lot more topics than that.
</p>

<p>
	Each topic Charlie asked about is a 5 hr conversation.
</p>

<p>
	This is the difficulty of talking about this stuff in a casual way to a general audience who has zero foundation in metaphysics or epistemology. It is like trying to explain calculus to an audience who never even learned arithmetic.
</p>

<p>
	Charlie's audience is gonna be very stage Orange so they will be extremely skeptical of anyone who questions science. That is a huge red flag in their mind. Because if science can be deconstructed their whole reality collapses and that is totally unacceptable.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why my videos are so long.
</p>

		<p>
			i posted this on another thread but it makes way more sense here
		</p>

		<p>
			you have no idea what infinite existence, or 'complete God-realization' truly is
		</p>

		<p>
			how could you possibly ever know when it's 'complete'
		</p>

		<p>
			you've experienced a microscopic degree of self-awareness of infinite existence (and i mean micro-fucking-scopic), but you have no idea how deep infinite existence really goes, or even what it actually is
		</p>

		<p>
			there's estimated to be 10,000 stars for every grain of sand on earth, or for a better analogy 100 billion - 200 billion galaxies, and you've just experienced the strongest psychedelic on 1 tiny planet out of all these galaxies, but think of all the psychedelics that could exist, or what other species that could have developed who may have a much better understanding due to the nature of their species, or the different conditions in which they could have developed over time
		</p>

		<p>
			we have no idea how aware of the source they could have become, because there are an infinite number of conditions that we do not know that could have enabled them to have greater self-awareness of it
		</p>

		<p>
			when you did those 13 5-MeO trips, you experienced a microscopic degree of self-awareness of infinite existence, and then when you did the 30 trips, you experienced a microscopic degree more self-awareness, but you still have no idea of how deeply self-aware of infinite existence you could become
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>the fact that there's a disparity at all is all the evidence you need to tell you that you don't know</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			your glimpses of self-transcendence don't mean you have any idea of what's really going on, and anyone on this forum who thinks they do really doesn't appreciate the infinity of infinity, and is deceiving themselves in thinking they do
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You don't understand.
</p>

<p>
	All of that is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	I became Infinitely Conscious. Which means I become absolutely conscious of everything. That's what it means to be God.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not conscious how you designed the whole universe, you aren't really awake.
</p>

<p>
	What I am talking about is beyond anything your mind can fathom and beyond anything any spiritual teaching has told you.
</p>

<p>
	My idea of what's going on is 100% Absolute. I am trying to guide you to that, most of you refuse to listen.
