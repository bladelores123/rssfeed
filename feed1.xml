<p>
	You should get in the habit of asking any girl you're flirting with, "By the way, are you single?"
</p>

<p>
	One of my fave questions to ask early on. If she says no, move on to another girl. This will save you a lot of wasted effort.

	Your mistake was vaping it when you should have plugged it.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is a lot more gentle and smooth. Yet still incredibly powerful.

<p>
	I've done it before. Not worth it. Mostly a waste of time and brings bad karma.
</p>

<p>
	Most girls will not cheat on their bf/husband. Some will, but is that really the kind of girl you want?
</p>

<p>
	There are plenty of single girls around. Focus on win-win arrangements.

<p>
	Yup. Too much seriousness means that one is taking life too seriously, which means that one isn't aware it's a dream.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, humor can also be used to avoid Truth and becomes the mark of a fool.
</p>

<p>
	Zen Masters aren't known for their humor.

But also, there's no reason why LSD can't show you that you are God.
</p>

<p>
	LSD is a damn fine psychedelic. One of the tops.
</p>

<p>
	You might also consider DPT and/or 4-AcO-DMT. 4-AcO-DMT is powerful as fuck when plugged. Watch out!
</p>

<p>
	Of course 5-MeO-DMT is incredible and life-transforming.
</p>

<p>
	Each psychedelic has it's own amazing qualities. Sometimes its hard to choose. It's an over-abundance of awesomeness. We are very lucky to have so many tools at our disposal. It's almost like having sex with different people.

	I'm not going to answer that because once we go down that rabbit hole each answer will spawn 5 more questions. Effective neurofeedback training is too complex to explain here. It would require an entire course.

<p>
	Yes, that's what real Love looks like.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard for many people to stomach it.
</p>

<p>
	I've seen some pundits criticizing that hug. Like it's not right. That criticism comes from a frightened ego of course. True love terrifies a weak ego.

My hopeful guess is your feeling out a way to share it  such that it finds its way to dedicated seekers only but doesnt cause enough noise to get itself scheduled. I want to try 5-meo SO FREAKING BAD, or hell even regular dmt, Its basically impossible to find unless you make it yourself or risk a dark web order, and I'm getting about that desperate even though I'm clueless about chemistry lol. The idea of a unscheduled psychedelic as powerful as 5-meo is making my mouth water! 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There are plenty of lesser psychedelics which are easily available. Start with the classic ones and their analogues which are common and popular.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is unscheduled doesn't necessarily make it easier to get than classic scheduled stuff.

<p>
	The Truth undermines survival, so it will never be agreed upon. Your mind's job is to avoid Truth at all costs.
</p>

<p>
	Misunderstanding of Truth is not a bug, it's a feature upon which your entire life is hinges.
</p>

<p>
	To know the Truth is to become unhinged.

<p>
	Rationality and cognition itself is a bias.
</p>

<p>
	Even perception is biased.
</p>

<p>
	But cool infographic!
</p>

<p>
	The trick is being able to spot them within yourself as you're doing them.

<p>
	It shows you what true meditation feels like. Without the machine the mind wanders around far too much and tends to stray from that narrow groove which is true meditation.
</p>

<p>
	The machine experientially guides you into the groove and keeps you there. It is a state of total thoughtlessness. It's very tricky to stay in that state without the machine.
</p>

<p>
	Really, in the future, all meditation will be done with a machine because it's too ineffective otherwise. This is why most meditators don't go far. They are unable to hit that groove even after years of practice. It takes talent to hit that groove. A talent most people lack and don't even know they lack. Most meditators don't even know what this groove is that I'm talking about. But a machine with the right training program and show it to you in 15 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	It will probably take 50-100 years for cheap, powerful, yet user-friendly meditation machines to develop. Right now they don't exist.

<title>Questions About Living Life? - Ask Here</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/40423-questions-about-living-life-ask-here/?do=findComment&amp;comment=506940</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I am collecting questions that I might answer in future vlogs. The idea is to focus each vlog on one question about living life.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Make your questions clear and concise.
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't ask me personal questions about my life.
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't tell me your life story. Just ask your question.
	</li>
	<li>
		There's no guarantee that your question will be selected for a vlog or answered. Given my limited time I have to be selective.
	</li>
	<li>
		I would tend to pick questions that would interest lots of others viewers. So don't make your questions too personal. Such as, "Should I become an musician or a filmmaker?" or "How do I get girl X to fall in love with me?"
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't ask questions which are too technical, such as, "How do I do meditation technique X?"
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Examples of the kind of questions I'm looking for:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Is it worthwhile to go college?
	</li>
	<li>
		Should I major in something I enjoy or something which is practical & earns money?
	</li>
	<li>
		What should I be focused on developing in my early 20s?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do I overcome fear of failure when starting a business?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is required to succeed in business?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do I become successful?
	</li>
	<li>
		Do all intimate relationships end in failure or is it possible to make them work?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do I balance between pursuing a career vs pursuing enlightenment?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is the role of technology in self-actualization?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do I self-actualize if I'm living in an under-developed 3rd world country?
	</li>
	<li>
		Should I become a monk? Is this a viable life path?
	</li>
	<li>
		How important is money for self-actualization? What is the proper role of money?
	</li>
	<li>
		I seem to be stuck in a rut. How do I motivate myself to start doing the work?
	</li>
	<li>
		Can I ignore enlightenment entirely and just focus on success? What will be the result of that?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Okay, you get the idea. Ask away.
</p>

<p>
	What questions do you have about living life?
</p>

<p>
	That's probably just the sales pitch to get people interested.

<p>
	If you teach Spiral Dynamics purely as theory, no one will buy a ticket. People want tangible results.

<p>
	Definitely
</p>

<p>
	At this stage in your life it's very open-ended. This is a great thing because it presents so much opportunity. Yet it can be daunting and paralyzing because you don't know where to start. Lots of research is a much. Explore what's possible. Don't just copy me. There's so much more to expanding consciousness than what I demonstrate or teach.
</p>

<p>
	There are a million ways to help expand consciousness. Find your niche. Think outside the box.

<p>
	Learning how to relax your mind and body is important. Orgasm can only occur when you body is tense.
</p>

<p>
	Controlling your mind is important too. Your mental imagery contributes a lot to how excited you get. You gotta learn to pace yourself, go slow, enjoy, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Of course good foreplay is key too. Perfect your fingering technique. Consider using toys to stimulate her long before the actual act.

<title>Marxist ideas to help create a more conscious society?</title>

<p>
	There's a lot of value there, although also some dangers if turned into an ideology. The thing is, capitalism and neo-liberalism have also been turned into dangerous ideologies. So ideology is a danger all around and is not somehow limited to communists or radical Islamists as American conventional wisdom would have us believe (itself an ideology).
</p>

<p>
	Professor Richard Wolff is a good role-model of a modern Marxist:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6v-7ZMSY6bQ?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	He's not always right, but he's more right than many neo-liberals.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem with Marxism was that it was far too advanced and idealistic for its time. It showed up 200 years too early. It could not be implemented because the people implementing it were basically at the level of consciousness and development of totalitarians. So we got totalitarian versions of Marxism which were obviously disastrous. For Marxist ideals to prosper a robust democracy is necessary. Even the US democracy is not yet strong enough to carry it. The US is still not democratic enough.

	This YouTuber makes great vlogs of how he lives in mainland China.
</p>

<p>
	Check out his channel. It's really good. He's lived in China for a decade and even married a cute Chinese girl.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be surprised how life in China is really like.

</p>

<p>
	If you ever decided to do psychedelics you'd have to be very careful about it. Dosing very gradually.
</p>

<p>
	This path requires careful experimentation. Or don't do it at all if you're unable to do it carefully and patiently.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to hurt yourself if you do things recklessly.
</p>

<p>
	Ibogaine should only be done with the help of a professional. It is not an at-home substance.
</p>

<p>
	Hehehe, of course a girl will never text you first. Why would she?
</p>

<p>
	Your problem here is that you fundamentally misunderstand how girls works and how texting works.
</p>

<p>
	You as the guy are supposed to proactively pursue her until you win her over. She will resist until you win her over.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. You cannot build attraction via text. If you fail to attract her face-to-face, the texts will go nowhere.
</p>

<p>
	Flake rate for phone numbers is about 90%+. If you're getting phone numbers you need to have REALLY solid face-to-face game AND you need lots of numbers. Hundreds of them. A number means very little. Girls give out their number too easily, even if they have zero intention of dating you.
</p>

<p>
	Your volume is too low and the quality of your face-to-face interactions is too low, failing to be memorable or spark attraction.
</p>

<p>
	Try harder. Make yourself memorable when you approach girls. You need to reach a hook point after opening. The hook point is when you can see she's interested in you. It's a very clear shift in the interaction. Hook point usually takes 3 to 10 minutes to hit. You won't hit it with every girl simply because the chemistry isn't meant to be there with every girl.
</p>

<p>
	I haven't found any good books on that. Flirting cannot be learned logically. You must learn it by doing it in the field.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you find a book that explains it perfectly, you will still be unable to do it in front of a live girl. Because the key to flirting is spontaneity. It can't be premeditated or rehearsed.
</p>

<p>
	It's like golf. You can't learn golf by reading a book.

<p>
	It costs about $2000 total at the cheapest. The machine is only half the cost. The software, accessories, and training programs are as expensive as the machine.
</p>

<p>
	It's not very accessible to ordinary folks, which I why I don't discuss it much. It has a very steep learning curve. You have to be a tech wiz to learn to use it properly. It took me a couple months of serious work to learn to use it. It works great, but it's very difficult to scale that to the masses.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are much more scalable and will take you deeper.

	If you awaken you'll realize you already are living forever. No fancy scientific gadgets required.

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

		<p>
			Why is it that the Truth is only ever discovered at the individual level, but that it never percolates through to whole communities/societies?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Because you ARE the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Society is designed to maximize your survival. Which is the opposite of Truth. Without society you couldn't be here contemplating Truth. So literally your Truth seeking is resting on a necessary foundation of social devilry.
</p>

<p>
	The only one who can awaken is a devil. If you didn't start out as a devil there'd be nothing to do.
</p>

<p>
	If everyone was fully awake the game of life would be over. And then who would there be to admire the majesty of God? So it's a catch-22.
</p>

<p>
	It's like this: cops can only exist if criminals exist. If the cops ever succeed in eliminating all the criminals, the cops will starve to death and nothing will be left. This is the case with all dualities. One requires the other otherwise you got nothing.

<p>
	A hand cannot grasp itself.
</p>

<p>
	But it is itself.
</p>

<p>
	God knows itself by being everything that is. Isness & knowing collapse into one, as you'd expect if you assume nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	The reason it must be this way is because knowing is finite. So it cannot encapsulate infinity. By definition, infinity is that which cannot be encapsulated because it is endless and all encapsulations are part of the thing they are trying to encapsulate.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're trying to put all of reality into a cardboard box. But what you're not realizing is that the cardboard box you're using is part of reality itself. So to succeed in putting reality in that cardboard box you'd have to fit your cardboard box inside your cardboard box. Which is obviously impossible.
</p>

<p>
	This is what I call the self-reference problem.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why reality/Truth cannot be grasped with thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how attached you are to the idea that Truth cannot be love.
</p>

<p>
	This is a bias which will cloud your ability to inquire into the nature of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	You consistently advance a dogma against love. This is inappropriate in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Let that dogma go and be willing to experience Truth as whatever it might be.
</p>

<p>
	The quotes you cite and arguments you make a just serving that dogma. You're attached to the Truth fitting some way you need it to be. Don't argue with me. Just notice what I'm pointing out to you.

<p>
	Fastest way to move past it is to find a new girl.
</p>

<p>
	Since you're at a university you've got tons of new girls all around you. Start talking to them. Go to some parties or social events. That will take your mind off her.
</p>

<p>
	Once you're talking to new girls, you'll care less about the old one.
</p>

<p>
	See this as an opportunity. Since your old relationship was toxic, nothing good would have come from it, so might as well move on. Now you have a chance to find a girl who's better aligned with you. Same goes for her.
</p>

Some places are great for day game, others are terrible.
</p>

<p>
	But also, 100 approaches is so little. You need to be doing 1000s of approaches at night.
</p>

<p>
	How do you flirt? You learn that by doing lots more approaches. You are not going to learn to flirt with 100 approaches.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try doing social circle. Build up a social circle. Once it gets big enough, you will be introduced to new friends and new girls. This tends to work best if you're the socializing type.
</p>

<p>
	Some degree of that is probably normal and not a big deal.
</p>

<p>
	What is more of problem is if you're having regrets being in your current relationship. Maybe something isn't quite the right fit there.
</p>

<p>
	If it's a long relationship I would try to work it out.
</p>

<p>
	If it's a short relationship then maybe you two aren't a good match.
</p>

<p>
	There will always be some tensions between stages. But the tensions are less brutal and problematic as we go higher.
</p>

<p>
	The tension between Green and Yellow should not be too bad.

<p>
	Once you get to Yellow there's no much fighting left.
</p>

<p>
	Each stage up involves less and less fighting and demonizing.
</p>

<p>
	Getting everyone to stage Green is crucial because at that point there will be a lot more peace. Hippies and New Agers aren't known for shooting people.

<p>
	In this case a realistic path forward would involve you first working on commercial videos to build up your skills, experience, and reputation. Then you could branch off and start a company/service where you specifically target more artsy clients who can appreciate what you offer.
</p>

<p>
	When you start business you usually have to send some years cutting your teeth on commercial work.
</p>

<p>
	In fact many filmmakers began their careers working literally on TV commercials. Working on artsy projects is usually something you have to earn.
</p>

<p>
	There are niches for artsy work but you'll have to figure out who those clients would be and what kind of services they need.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't get too attached to your medium. You should be somewhat flexible about your medium. The medium should ultimately serve your highest impact. If your medium is too limiting, consider upgrading to something which more directly serves your impact statement. Why are you so attached to editing being the way for raising collective consciousness. There might be more direct ways of raising collective consciousness than splicing videos.
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe then you don't really care about raising collective consciousness? Maybe you care more about video? In which case you need to re-think your impact statement.
</p>

	P.S. Funny story, I was house shopping this weekend. At one house I met a real estate lady. She asked me what I do. I said I'm a Youtuber. She said, "OH! You know I just discovered this guy on YT I really like." And I thought to myself, "Oh no, here it comes..." And she said, "Do you know this guy Jordan Peterson? I really love his stuff! I just discovered him." I held my tongue and kept on walking. "Yeah... he's somethin...", I said.

			Could this be an explanation why some people seem to behave in higher levels of the spiral, and then suddenly act out?  As if they'd been hiding a more basic stage and then it lashes out?  Like a "closet" stage hidden since they sense it wouldn't be socially acceptable to be it?

<p>
	Well, I'd probably call that a shadow.
</p>

<p>
	It's common to have at least one color shadow. Common shadows are Green, Orange, or Blue. A shadow here would be one color which triggers you or you love to hate.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you can't stand religious people, that's a Blue shadow. If you can't stand greedy Wall Street types, that's an Orange shadow. If you can't stand hippies and SJWs, that's a Green shadow.

<p>
	That is the nature of all words. They all mean things.
</p>

<p>
	The very thing you dislike about the word "devilry" is the very thing I like about it and why I use it. It's provocative. It can be powerful to call a devil a devil to his face.
</p>

<p>
	When I call a viewer a devil, that has a certain affect on their psyche. It punches through the veil. A devil doesn't like being called out.

</p>

<p>
	There is no argument here.
</p>

<p>
	Every word is a category. How you draw your categories is relative to how you want to frame things.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you used the category Maya. Which is similar to the category of devilry.

	Now it's time to infect the world.
</p>

<p>
	Muahahahahah....
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty silly though to grow psilocybin via bacteria when you can just chemically synthesize kilograms of it in a lab in hours.
</p>

<p>
	Synthesizing psychedelics is so easy for scientists and medical companies.
</p>

<p>
	There exist ways of synthesizing DMT simply from stirring together basic chemical reagents in plastic tubs.

</blockquote>

<p>
	All these terms and framings are relative. You can frame reality in a thousand different ways.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness and deception could be defined as opposites of Consciousness and Being.
</p>

<p>
	Or they could be integrated into a larger unity.
</p>

<p>
	It all depends on how you want to frame things.
</p>

<p>
	We make verbal and conceptual distinctions to do certain intellectual work. Lumping everything into one thing isn't always helpful.
</p>

<p>
	For example, telling someone that Trump is the purest, highest form of consciousness would be highly misleading. It's useful in this case to call Trump a devil.

			What I am trying to point to is that this is all within Worldness, God accepts all of Worldness. So the closer we get to Godness, if we were to frame it as a duality, would we not more and more come to see the utter Wisdom in all aspects of Isness, including suffering? Would we really call it devilry? Could we infact call it anything at all?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Which is why I said devil = God.
</p>

<p>
	Devilry is a relative term. You have to understand what it means in the context I use it in. I use this as a technical term in my overall framework to refer to acts of blind selfishness and deception.
</p>

<p>
	So when I say, "Trump is a devil" I mean a very specific thing.
</p>

<p>
	Reality has a devilish aspect to it. This is the aspect of trickery and illusion. So deny devilry is silly. Yet of course devilry is just an aspect of God in the big picture.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Probably. Intrinsic motivation is the best kind.
</p>

<p>
	But also, being self-taught does not contradict school or education. I am self-taught precisely because I had a great formal education.
</p>

<p>
	Formal education primes the pump for self-teaching. The point of school is to teach you how to teach yourself and make you passionate about learning. Of course many schools are bad at doing this. But some succeed.
</p>

<p>
	Going to university does not contradict being self-taught. If you attend university properly you will turn it into a self-teaching program.

<p>
	Sure you can test it, but before a thing even deserves to be tested, you gotta at least explain how it should work in theory.
</p>

<p>
	If your plane cannot even fly in theory, testing it will not magically make it fly.

	That's exactly what I said.

<p>
	Now the question is, how does your philosophy actually look like when applied to real-world problems like healthcare, corporate lobbying, environmental regulation, taxation, immigration, foreign policy, economic policy, gun control, abortion, etc.?

<p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Obviously not since this problem does not exist in Canada and in most other wealthy developed countries.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is not lack of doctors. The problem is the corporate greed and devilry of the US healthcare industry cartel.
</p>

<p>
	There is no reason why everyone in America cannot have decent healthcare. But the healthcare industry would have to make a lot less profit off sick people. There's your real bottleneck.
</p>

<p>
	And no amount of robots or AI will solve this problem. Be careful with your tech fantasies. Tech does not resolve fundamental problems of devilry, it makes them worse.
</p>

<p>
	We are the bottleneck in that we are devils.

<title>Can creativity be &quot;damaged&quot;?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/40278-can-creativity-be-damaged/?do=findComment&amp;comment=505263</link>

<p>
	Creativity can be damaged in the following sense: if you feel creative urges yet you ignore them because of fear about practical matters like money, etc, and if you do that long enough, eventually you will lose your soul and turn into a zombie.
</p>

<p>
	You must act on your creative passions. In a sensible and non-reckless way.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			"If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you."
		</p>

		<p style="text-align:right;">
			-- Gospel of Thomas
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Why are you wasting a minute of your life doing anything which isn't your highest creative passion? Can you see how foolish and inefficient such action is? You are pissing millions of dollars of value down the drain this way. Your time should be your most precious commodity. Don't sell it to fools for pennies.
</p>

<p>
	That's the voice of God speaking to you, but you're refusing the call.
</p>

<p>
	You're acting too small. You need a much bigger vision. You need a big life purpose, not this wallowing is personal problems bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	God is telling you to make your life about something much bigger than you. But you're too scared so you just wallow around in your own smallness. You should be doing big things with your life. Why aren't you doing them? You could transform the whole world and yet you're just pissing your life away instead.
</p>

<p>
	See my videos:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		The Highest Hero's Journey
	</li>
	<li>
		How To Unleash Your Ambition
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	And do my LP Course. It's all about this.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you're depressed because you're not actualizing your full greatness. You could be a Christ or a Buddha. What are you waiting for??? Your spirituality is far too timid. Be more bold! Dare to touch people's hearts with your love.
</p>

<p>
	The people around you are sheep. Don't look to sheep for inspiration. Look to lions. Become a lion.

<p>
	That's right, ego is superior at illusion, lying, and devilry. Which is precisely its function.
</p>

<p>
	You merge the two like so:
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be awakening without survival. So any rejection of survival is ultimately a rejection of God. So by rejecting the devil you reject God. Because the devil is God.
</p>

<p>
	Ego = God
</p>

<p>
	The circle is complete.
