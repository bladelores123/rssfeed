	If the horror can be embraced, love becomes that much stronger.
</p>

<p>
	How weak would love be if it could not embrace horror? That is not true Love. Love can handle it all.

<p>
	You can find such a service but you should expect to spend more than $100. One session is not gonna be enough.
</p>

<p>
	If you value spirituality, you shouldn't be cheap with it. These people work hard so they deserve compensation.

<p>
	Just be careful that you don't make some poorly-researched rash decision. A big move like that requires lots of homework and research to make sure it's feasible.
</p>

<p>
	Business ideas need to be carefully tested to make sure they can fly. Never just blindly go all-in.

<title>Career in politics compatible with spirituality?</title>

<p>
	Sounds to me like your unique skillset, passion, and level of consciousness would go to waste in a standard political position.
</p>

<p>
	You can make a powerful political impact with spirituality. But it will probably be a much less orthodox path.
</p>

<p>
	Look to Gandhi as a role-model of what's possible. You don't have to work within the system. You can help mobilize people from outside government to care about things like corruption, Green values, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's compatible, but you're gonna have to design your own niche to make it work.

There are entire websites that cater to guys who like fat girls, skinny girls, tall girls, short girls, black girls, old girls, young girls, hairy girls, shaved girls, Asian girls, Muslim girls, Christian girls, even girls with dicks and a thousand other things.

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	Aloneness just means oneness. And oneness just means unity with everything.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that you're alone and separated. It's that you're are so merged and united with everything that there's nothing you're not intimately connected with.
</p>

<p>
	When you are having sex, two unite and become one. And this one is then alone (only logical). But this aloneness is really just as close as two can ever get: a total Unity. So there's nothing to worry about. Don't think of sex as aloneness. Think of it as unity.
</p>

<p>
	What you really seek your whole life is Unity. And now you are like the dog that finally caught its own tail, only to realize, "Hey! But this is just a closed loop! It's all me! Now I have nothing else to unite with! Boo-hoo..."
</p>

<p>
	But don't forget, you are now fully united, so you don't need anything else to unite with! The circle is complete. Enjoy <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like you've stuck your dick inside a nice warm vagina and then you say, "Oh man! This sucks! Now I have nowhere to stick my dick." You must realize that you've arrived! The chase is over.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, if you did a mind-meld with every living being in the universe, you'd be totally alone. How else could it be?

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To be fair, wanting to grow financially is still a form of growth (just a relatively low one). But hey, many people need to start low. Moving from Blue to Orange will often involve growing financially. Remember, financial growth is not simply about earning more cash. To really grow in this area usually requires some significant and serious mindset shifts. For example, for a person to go from working a 9-5 job to being a successful entrepreneur usually takes a lot of inner growth. It's not simply a matter of money. You have to start to think about the world and yourself differently.
</p>

<p>
	Starting a business is one of the best and most practical ways to grow yourself as a person, especially within Tier 1 of the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that many people who want more money do not even understand that money is a function of one's being. So when you ask them, "Do you want to grow as a person?" they don't make the connection between that and earning more money. They think they can just have lots of money while staying the same inside. Which would be disastrous even if it ever came to be.
</p>

<p>
	A powerful way to help people grow is to show them how things like money, sex, success, fame, a good relationship, a good family, good physical appearance, and happiness are best achieved through deep inner growth, not by chasing externals directly.
</p>

	So very practically you need to change your life around so that you have more socialization opportunities on a regular basis. The rest will mostly auto-correct.
</p>

<p>
	You can't get good at socializing if you're alone most of the time.
</p>

<p>
	There is no specific way that you must be when you socialize. You can basically be totally natural unless you're some kind of psycho, in which case you'll have to reign that in. Be chill, friendly, pleasant, playful, honest, expressive, and relaxed. That usually works best.
</p>

<p>
	You'll be amazed at how often people just accept you exactly for how you are. Perhaps the biggest mistake of learning to socialize is to try to act a certain way to please people or meet their expectations. Just be you. Not everyone will jive with you, but that doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
	Be comfortable in your own skin. Act with strangers the same way you'd act with close family. Assume everyone already knows each other. Don't try to act cool or impressive.
</p>

<p>
	As simple as all these things are, it can take years to learn. Especially if you've developed bad habits.
</p>

<p>
	That's a big if.
</p>

<p>
	And presence has many degrees. You can be 1000x more present than you are right now. And it's also a matter of consistency. Can you stay present for 1hr straight? If you could, you'd already be enlightened.

<p>
	Love isn't just something you value, Love is what you are.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to lose Love while you're so wrapped up in chasing sex.
</p>

<p>
	The thing you most want is the very thing you push away in your desperation to get it.
</p>

<p>
	But do whatever you gotta do to learn that lesson.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful to distinguish Love and sex/girls.

<p>
	The opposite is the real question: how can you have a relationship with anyone if you two are not one?
</p>

<p>
	A relationship is a kind of union.
</p>

<p>
	What you ultimately seek is Unity. So it's very fortunate that in fact everything is one.

And that's assuming they are doing some kind of active self-improvement work.
</p>

<p>
	Your time might be better spent helping other people who are eager to grow, rather than dragging a stubborn old mule up hill.
</p>

<p>
	A person cannot be forced to grow unless they are interested in growth.
</p>

<p>
	Before teaching someone, you might first want to ask them, "On a scale of 1 to 10, how interested are you in growing yourself as a human?"

<p>
	FYI, it takes most people 5 years to move up one stage. And that's assuming the person is doing some kind of personal development work. If they are just coasting through life, forget about it.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why changing people doesn't usually work.

<p>
	Sam Harris has seen the tip of the Ox's tail, but not the full Ox. In this case atheism can still be maintained.
</p>

<p>
	But if he ever saw the full Ox, he'd realize how wrong he was.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of seeing the Ox. To call someone awakened who's only seen the tip is very misleading.
</p>

<p>
	Realization of no-self is only the beginning. It's the least profound aspect of God.
</p>

<p>
	20 years of meditation means nothing. What matters is what insights one has reached.
</p>

	There are many practical problems with abolishing private ownership of businesses.
</p>

<p>
	Let's say you work for 5 years to start your business. Now it's successful. You want to hire a couple of low level employees. Do they now own part of your business? This would be quite problematic and unfair.

			Love is what's True. The void is the mechanism that allows God to forget what it is????

			To be honest I have never experienced God as Love, only as the void, and the void just gets more and more voidy. The world gets more and more hollogramish the more meditation that happens. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So it is hard for me to understand how the void is not True? The void is simply a mechanism for forgetting??? But isn't the fact that every object in the universe is hollow and made of nothingness True???

<p>
	No, it's not about belief. Intention is a separate matter.

<p>

			I started to notice this phenomena by watching responses of trip reports in the forum. A lot of trip reports in the past were seeing the void. As soon as Leo made videos about love, people all of a sudden were tripping and feeling absolute love. Which made me hypothesise that these facets were being influenced by the belief system and teachings that a particular person followed.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, the Absolute is Absolute. It's not relative as you assume.
</p>

<p>
	Once you see all the facets you will understand why people disagree about them. Because few have seen them all.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not a belief and it is not influenced by anything.
</p>

<p>
	Of course what you contemplate and set your intention for drives which facet will be revealed to you. So in this sense, yeah, if you go into a trip desiring to know about love, you will be shown love rather than something else.

</p>

<p>
	Common values are the most important factor for making relationships work. Spiral colors are different sets of values.

<p>
	I don't think Dems are interested in a centrist billionaire.
</p>

<p>
	Bloomberg has no base of support. The people who might support him already got Biden and Buttigeg, and the Warren and Sanders and Yang supporters will never accept Bloomberg.
</p>

<p>
	Bloomberg will not make any of the debates. He just wants to buy the election, which I think voters are too smart to tolerate. Bloomberg offers nothing new.

	The real problem here is that Bloomberg might simply use the Dems as a launching point for a 3rd party run, which could be a big problem in the general election. Seems like Bloomberg is not truly running to win the Dem primary but to set himself up as a 3rd party after the Dem is selected. There's just no way Bloomberg will overtake Bernie, Warren, or Biden. Biden may be a centrist but at least he's someone people can relate to. Bloomberg is gonna look like an elitist asshole. The Rust Belt is not going to vote for him.

<p>
	I think there's depth to any state of consciousness, and there is nothing but states of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There are states of consciousness so nondual you would not be able to walk straight. Seems hard to make such things permanent. Usually one's baseline state will be much lower than a possible peak.
</p>

<p>
	But ultimately I don't know. It's a tricky topic since you need reference points of what's possible, and those are hard to come by and even harder to communicate and share.

<p>
	Sahaja Samadhi is the end goal: a permanent state of nondual awareness 24/7 regardless of what you're doing.
</p>

<p>
	You don't access it, you are in nonduality at all times. That's the ideal. And ideally you don't get lured out of it by cravings and attachments.
</p>

<p>
	Accessing special states would be icing on that nondual cake.

<p>
	Sadhguru is not in a no man's land of no perception in his regular life. That might be a state he enters when he sits in deep meditation, not while he's driving his motorbike.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be nuanced here. There are many possible states of consciousness with psychedelics, not just some one state called "enlightenment".
</p>

<p>
	There are various kinds of samadhi states which have been catalogued by mystics and gurus throughout the ages.

<p>
	It is what it is. Arguing with people is largely a waste of time. If you care about truth you will sit down and do the work.
</p>

<p>
	Question what reason is. Study what post-rationality is. Don't take my word for it. I just don't have 10 years to explain to you all the limits of reason. It is your job to figure that out. I just give quick pointers. Under each pointer might lie 5 or 10 years of study and contemplation. So of course without doing that the pointer will mean very little to you.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse this work with any kind of proof. We're not in the business of proof or argumentation, we're in the business of self-reflection and exploration of how our minds work.
</p>

<p>
	The only way you can learn how your mind works is by studying how your mind works. Not by listening to arguments.
</p>

<p>
	Everything worth knowing can be found directly in your experience, so there is no need to argue about it. Observation work is necessary.

<p>
	This is really a discussion about feminism, and a lack of understanding of it's historical development and function in society.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to start a thread about understanding feminism, go for it. But let's get not derail this thread any further with debates about the validity of feminism.
</p>

<p>
	This threat for posting more Stage Green examples, positive and negative ones. Remember, to understand Stage Green is not the same as saying it is the end-all-be-all and that it doesn't have its problems and limits. There are much higher worldviews than Green. But to not understand Green is an obstacle to reaching those. Green's validity needs to be acknowledged to go higher.

<p>
	There are truths so much more advanced and more important than science that they make science look like a joke.
</p>

<p>
	If you could access such truth you would stop wasting your time reading science or trying to convince scientists of their blindness.
</p>

<p>
	It is mistake to ask spirituality to lower itself to the gross material domain of science.
</p>

<p>
	There is an endless list of technical problems to solve and solving them does not really improve the human condition.

<p>
	The cheif function of reason is to realize its own limitations and go beyond itself to vision-logic and then even further to pure consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Reason eats its own tail if you question it deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	At post-rational even the notion of argument falls apart. There is nothing to argue and no one to argue with but yourself.

<p>
	It's far more complex than that.

<p>
	America has pockets of Blue. Lots of it in the South, which is of course a geographical factor. Rural America is much less developed than urban America.

<p>
	No problem here at all.
</p>

<p>
	The rational is being criticized from post-rational. Post-rational still uses reason but recognizes its limits, whereas the rational does not recognize the limits of reason. Which is Sam Harris' biggest problem.

	Love is the not result of structure, but structure is the result of love.
</p>

<p>
	Life has a very specific structure which has a logic to it.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying one part of reality is better than another. I am saying the entire thing as a whole works to maximize love.
</p>

<p>
	You are overlooking the intelligence that went into the design. This intelligence wasn't just dicking around, telling itself that nothing matters and spawning monstrosities. It had a goal in mind: to maximize the sharing of love / God.

		</p>

		<p>
			What would you advise in such a case? Literally all those 20 minutes are spent sitting still and mind just wandering to all those places, which I know are the needs that I haven't satisfied yet. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I think that keeping at least 20 minutes of meditation habit is a good starting point, and the main focus must be on keeping the habit, no matter what.
		</p>

		<p>
			What do you suggest?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, firstly, 20 mins is the bare minimum. It usually takes 20 mins just to calm the mind. So you could meditate longer.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, part of meditation practice is training to quickly let things go. It's a skill.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, you could even practice a bit of meditation while around people. Mindfulness shouldn't end out the door of your house.

<title>Pseudoscience in Spirituality, Sadhguru</title>

<p>
	Sadhguru is basically talking about selective breeding and artifical selection, which is how we create different dog breeds and domesticated animals.
</p>

<p>
	But also, Samskaras are not just genetic. Family lineage has a huge cultural and memetic component. Things get passed down through culture, not just genes.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a giant family of goldsmiths, they will certain infect your mind with goldsmithing memes. Just like how a family history of sexual abuse is likely to pass on to the children. Not via genes but via parental abuse.
</p>

<p>
	To reduce Samskara to genetics is to misunderstand it.
</p>

<p>
	African Americans have a collective Samskara due to slavery, even though one's genes might not have slavery encoded into them.

<p>
	What?? No! Just go out and be social and share yourself freely. Why are you constructing this pathetic gloomy narrative?
</p>

<p>
	Go have fun. Then come back home and meditate your ass off. You can do both.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make your socializing too serious. A Buddha should be able to go out to a bar and drink some beers with some strangers and talk shit. Then return to his Buddhahood.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, life is long and you got plenty of time to space stuff out. You don't have to do it all at once.

<p>
	And all that black people could do was demand to be freed. And here we are.

	Nature is anything which occurs. So your point is moot. Feminism is as much "nature" as patriarchy is. So who's version of "nature" will prevail? That's what this whole debate is about.

<p>
	That's your opinion, and obviously many feminists disagree.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, both can be done at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	Asking women to "shut up and become more competent" before you give them respect is the very injustice and patriarchy which is in question. Why should women have to work extra hard to please you? Who are you to tell them what is right and what they must do in order to be treated as they feel is fair?
</p>

<p>
	Maybe when a person tells you that she is being treated unfairly you should take it seriously rather than telling her to work harder and be more competent? Just a crazy thought.

			I also think that you didn't understand what I meant when I said that structure is an illusion, so let me elaborate on that. If you look at a house from the outside, you could say that the house is over there and the structure of the house is that it has 4 rooms. But then go inside the house and now the house is something that's around you, and it doesn't have four rooms anymore because, now from your perspective, the house starts at the walls that surround you. Do you see now that structure is relative to your perspective? <em>Structure</em> is not an objective thing, <em>structure </em>is one of the pattern-matching functions of the human mind.

<p>
	This dream in which we're in has a very specific structure. It has specific physical laws, rules, things, matter, energy, people, etc. This structure is not random or accidental. It was designed by an infinite intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Now I ask you, Why did infinite intelligence select this structure? Why weren't you born with a dick on your forehead?
</p>

<p>
	Ever wonder about that?
</p>

<p>
	In the end you'll discover the answer is: To maximize love.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot be explained to you any further because you'd need a massive awakening to understand it. And that's not ever going to happen from reading my words.

	It's complicated. The restrictions are systemic, cultural, psychological, and sociological. Both men and women are involved without being conscious of it.

<p>
	This case is one example of what is meant by patriarchy.
</p>

<p>
	As a basic example, many video games don't even allow the player to create a female character AT ALL! You are just forced to be male! And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, Green isn't seeking to replace one inequality with an opposite one. Green simply asks for equality.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, in a patriarchy, the whole point is that women CANNOT do whatever they want about men because women have been denied positions of power.
</p>

<p>
	To make this example clear for you, women in Saudi Arabia cannot do whatever they want. Men actively prevent them.
</p>

<p>
	But you will say that America is not Saudi Arabia. True, it's more subtle in America, but it still exists. You just don't notice it because you're male and it doesn't even register on your radar because it is irrelevant to your ego's survival.

The point is that society & culture is dominated by certain sets of values which please one group of people while marginalizing another, and so of course the marginalized group will seek to equalize this situation.
</p>

<p>
	The problem she has is that women in video games are not depicted as women would depict themselves, but as objects for gratification for men. Which she views as unfair. And the reason this happens is because the video game developers are mostly young, immature men, so they depict women to please their own fantasies, not as women would depict themselves. If there were more women working in video games, video games would have a more fair and accurate depiction of women.
</p>

<p>
	Anyhow, don't get lost in the details. This is a thread about Stage Green, not women or video games. The details are irrelevant. What's important is that you see the structural inequality that Green sees.

<p>
	You are blaming individuals while refusing to acknowledge the systemic and collective aspects of this issue.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, self-esteem has an individual aspect, but it also has a collective and cultural aspect. Stage Green is about seeing collective aspects, which does not deny the individual aspects.
</p>

<p>
	If you really care to understand this issue, read some books on feminism to understand why feminism is needed in some areas.

<p>
	That's because you're looking at it from a Stage Orange, selfish perspective. As long as it makes your dick hard, you're good. But there are other concerns.
</p>

<p>
	For example, have you considered how such overly-sexualized depictions affect the self-esteem of young girls? What if you had a daughter and she grew up with self-esteem problems because her tits did not look like those of Tomb Raider? Then you, as the father, would have to deal with that.
</p>

<p>
	Sarkisian's point is not that all sexuality should be banned, but that things are overly-sexualized in ways which are designed to cater to men's desires, and that women are not fairly depicted as they really are, but as men want them to be for their sexual gratification.
</p>

<p>
	How would you feel if all video games were made to please the desires of butch lesbians? You wouldn't like it. How would you feel if all guys in video games were depicted with giant dicks, making your girlfriend ask you, "Why is your dick so small?"
</p>

<p>
	See, when the shoe is on the other foot, you start to cry and whine about how unfair things are. But when things are skewed in your favor, you think it's great and there is no problem.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying Sarkisian never goes too far. She's certainly stuck in unhealthy Green. But the problem is that you still don't understand her. Which is a problem not for her, but for you.
</p>

<p>
	Not a fair point when you take into account scale.
</p>

<p>
	It's a totally different challenge to provide 1+ billion people with toilets.
</p>

<p>
	Everybody overlooks the problems that come with scale. How to organize 1 billion people is a problem of epic proportions requiring a God-like intellect to solve.
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention that technology has advanced far beyond toilets.

<p>
	You should distinguish between a thing being true vs how others might use it to justify whatever devilry they want.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it is a general truism that men are physically stronger than women. But some devil could use this to justify raping women. Just because he does that does not undermine the original truth. Truth is always used by devils for selfish purposes. Clearly Sadhguru is not doing that. He's not justifying anything, he's explaining the notion of Samskara, which is a very powerful notion that would be worth your time studying and understanding. Samskara is not just genetics, it's broader and more profound than that.

<p>
	Hehe... yeah. That's exactly what high-consciousness teachings sound like. Because you are judging them from a low level of consciousness, lacking Sadhguru's decades of deep mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	To understand a sage you must access the states of consciousness he has accessed.

All of that is dependent on different starting conditions. What the conditions and who is advantaged or disadvantaged is irrelevant, since reality unfolds in chaotic and backward ways, with one part sloping up, another sloping down, and then many oscillations and reversals.
</p>

<p>
	The development of nations is not linear, it is chaotic.
</p>

<p>
	Europe had a tremendous amount of competition which lead to lots of development.
</p>

<p>
	The actual details of the history are not important. What's important is the general principle that in a chaotic system small differences in starting conditions lead to very different evolutionary paths.
</p>

<p>
	And the ultimate point is that it is foolish to blame anyone for these developmental paths. The paths are precisely whatever they are and no one is to blame (as Sam Harris likes to do). It is like blaming a 3rd grader for not yet being a 5th grader. Well, some people take longer to reach 5th grade. Rather than blaming them, help them along.

<p>
	And the whole GamerGate reaction against her is mostly grounded in stage Blue/Orange.
</p>

<p>
	GamerGate is a great example of how Tier 1 fights with itself, not able to understand each other. Each side feels self-righteous and therefore unable to learn from the other side.

<p>
	You'd have to study a lot of history and culture of the Middle East.
</p>

<p>
	The classic book: Gun, Germs, and Steel makes some interesting points about how geographical conditions shape development of nations and cultures.
</p>

<p>
	It's not exactly rocket science to suggest that geography plays an important role in how nations develop and survive.
</p>

<p>
	Arabian culture was highly tribal because survival in harsh desert climates is no easy business. That strong tribalism is evident even today.
</p>

<p>
	You can think of nations almost like species. Different bird species develop and survive in different ways depending on the geography they must survive in -- as Darwin discovered and catalogued. Well, same thing with nations. Some nations develop quickly because their environment demands it. Other nations develop slowly because their environment allows for it. Some species like crocodiles have not changed much in the last 50 million years while others like birds and primates had to evolve rapidly to adapt to new emerging environments. To reduce all this complexity to problematic passages within the Quran is rather silly. The Quran itself is a byproduct of this evolutionary process of survival.
</p>

<p>
	Islam is a religion uniquely suited to survival within the conditions where it arose. Unfortunately as the world becomes more globalized Islam has difficulty adapting to more modern times. But this problem is not unique to Islam. All religions face this problem to some extent. Fundamentalism is a reactionary movement against modernization and secularism. Fundamentalist movements exist within Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, etc. Fundamentalism is an ego backlash against modernity and post-modernity.
</p>

	In practice maintaining a harem requires a lot of lying and manipulating. The girls are never satisfied being in the harem long-term. Girls inevitably drop out and must be replaced with new ones. But it's easy for the guy to justify it to himself because he's getting laid so much.

	This work is full of dangers. Which is why so few people truly master it.

<p>
	You can go deeply by yourself. You don't need to crawl up someone's ass to go deep. RationalWiki doesn't need to blindly follow me. All they need to do is sit down and do the practices by themselves. It would also be a mistake for RationalWiki to only listen to my teachings. They should cross-reference my teachings with those of a 100 other gurus, yogis, mystics, philosophers, psychonauts, etc. to find the common ground.
</p>

<p>
	Working through this material carefully by yourself is the key. Nothing can be taken for granted, believed, or assumed.

<p>
	I have no serious criticisms of him. He knows his shit.
</p>

<p>
	He doesn't deny love. He talks quite a bit about Eros (his term of Love), and he says that the driving force behind all evolution is love. Which is correct in my view, although even that doesn't go far enough to underscore the importance of Love in all of Creation.
</p>

<p>
	He might not be as explicit about Infinite Love as I am, equating Love & Truth. But that's probably because he has not accessed some of the deepest insights I have accessed via psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	I think his understanding of reality would be deeper if he went deeply into psychedelics. But oh well. It's good enough. You can only ask so much of a guy. He has done several life-times-worth of amazing work.
</p>

<p>
	Ken is one of the greatest Western philosophers and intellectuals who has ever lived. We are lucky to be alive alongside him. It's sad that his health as deteriorated so quickly.

Really, the question becomes so internalized that it melt away and all you're left with is the raw present moment.
</p>

<p>
	Self-inquiry must take you out of your mind. If you're doing it as the level of mind, that's not going to do much. Out of your mind is the key. You must leave behind the verbal / logical domain.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics work by effortlessly taking you out of your mind.

<title>Spending $3000 on a Pick-Up Boot Camp - Good Idea?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/42510-spending-3000-on-a-pick-up-boot-camp-good-idea/?do=findComment&amp;comment=531556</link>

<p>
	A) You can certainly find cheaper trainings.
</p>

<p>
	B) You'd get a lot more value out of simply connecting with a few experienced wingmen in your city who can show you the ropes for free.
</p>

<p>
	Bootcamps can be a good way to get yourself in the game but the chief problem is that they are too short. Your results will not come from the bootcamp but from the daily follow-up work you do. The follow-up work is the most important part. Because every weekend needs to become your personal bootcamp.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate the importance of having just 1 or 2 experienced wingmen to go out with every weekend. This is HUGE! It's worth much more than a bootcamp in terms of results.
</p>

<p>
	But if you got the money to burn, a bootcamp can be a good way to jumpstart this whole process.
</p>

<p>
	I did a bootcamp for $2000, but I got a lot more value from finding great wingmen. I also had lots of money to burn, so $2000 was not a big deal to spend.
</p>

<p>
	You can find wingmen via online forums or by attending an RSD FreeTour in your city. Befriend everyone at the FreeTour. Get their phone numbers and start going out with them every night.
</p>

<p>
	All that a bootcamp really is, is some dude telling you to approach girls and forcing you to do it all night long. If you can discipline yourself to approach all night long, you don't really need a bootcamp. But of course this discipline is really hard for newbies, so you may need it.
</p>

<p>
	If we were doing a bootcamp, we would just walk into a club and I would point out random girls and force you to approach them. After you fail, I would just tell you to immediately approach the next girl. We would do this 20-50 times over 3-4 hours.
</p>

<title>Would an Enlightened Person be able to say no to heroin?</title>

<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Keep in mind that the Absolute is distinct from the structures of the mind/brain/self. Which means it's possible to awaken but still have addictions. Because addictions are baked into the structure of the mind/brain/self. Awakening itself does not necessarily change the mind/self. Which is why an awakened person can still smoke cigs, have a porn addiction, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can think of it this way: awakening disidentifies you from your mind. But the mind still continues to fire according to its lifetime of karma. If you spent a lifetime watching porn, your mind has been programmed with that habit, and awakening will not automatically remove all that. You will have to retrain your mind.
</p>

<p>
	This is why many awakened people are still flawed and still have bad habits and cravings.
</p>

<p>
	The mistaken assumption is that awakening will perfect the mind. This is simply untrue in practice. What perfects the mind is deliberate training, which many people neglect to do, especially after an awakening or two.
</p>

<p>
	Perfecting the mind is harder than awakening.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you could get many awakened people hooked on heroin. Because in truth they ain't that awake.
</p>

<p>
	YES! This is exactly what awakening is about.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not something you think. It's more felt. It's pure, raw experience. Ideally the mind is shut off or at least sidelined.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is nothing other than the present moment, observed intensely for what it is.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like this Kratom helped you enter a mild samadhi state. It's not an out of body experience, it's a nondual state of consciousness. Which is exactly what you want in this work. From this state you can now contemplate metaphysical questions and get profound answers -- not verbal answers but actual answers!

<p>
	This is such a fluke condition that you cannot apply it other mental disorders.
</p>

<p>
	Mental disorders are legion, and most of them will slow down your path to awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are also some "disorders" which are called disorders but really are not. Don't forget that "disorder" is relative notion.
</p>

<p>
	Many a foolish doctor would call enlightenment a "disorder", without realizing that being a doctor is the real disorder here.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't it funny how considering oneself to be a human is not considered a disorder? Talk about self-bias! Lol

<title>Criticism of Ken Wilber</title>

<p>
	Having read the criticisms in more depth, I want to underscore that many criticisms of Ken Wilber are foolish and that the bulk of his written work is as solid as can be.
</p>

<p>
	Minor criticisms like his support for Andrew Cohen, Adi Da, and his over-emphasis of the Mean Green Meme and his political prescriptions are all knit-picks compared to the bulk of his written work, which is solid, and which has little to do with those things.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get distracted by the politics surrounding the Integral Institute. Just focus on his written work, which is genius.
</p>

<p>
	And as always, don't expect any teacher to be perfect in their embodiment or conduct.
</p>

<p>
	The criticism's of Ken Wilber found on the following website, for example, are pure BS:

<title>Suicide for a good cause - Ego or Selflessness?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/42539-suicide-for-a-good-cause-ego-or-selflessness/?do=findComment&amp;comment=531487</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	It can be an act of selflessness. Think of Christ or Gandhi. You can basically sacrifice yourself for your life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	But this is still all part of the relative domain of life/death. From the Absolute perspective there is no one to die.
</p>

<p>
	But if you get it in your mind this idea of "I will sacrifice myself in the name of glory and I will go down in history as a good human being." << That's ego
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to create a self-righteous fantasy about sacrificing yourself. Rather, act as though you are not important at all.
</p>

<p>
	There is no sense is committing suicide for a good cause. No good cause requires your suicide. Rather just do your work and if you happen to get killed in the process by some haters, so be it. But if you actively try to be a martyr, that's ego.
</p>

<p>
	A true martyr never tries to be martyr. He's just doing his work and others react to it.
</p>

<p>
	If your life becomes selfless and has great impact on others, you will naturally develop haters who wish you harm.
</p>

	The whole point of the notion of a soul is that it persists between lifetimes as an intermediate structure between the human self and the Godhead.

</p>

<p>
	Anywhere it goes, it is nowhere and nothing.
</p>

<p>
	From the highest POV, there is no difference between the universe existing and it not.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, these are nuanced distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	Of course from the ultimate absolute level nothing can be distinct at all, at which point soul merges into the godhead.

When people refer to "individual soul", they refer to their ego, it's that simple. In other words, because there is no self, there is also no individual soul.

<p>
	No, soul is not the same as ego.
</p>

<p>
	These are naunced distinctions which require much spiritual experience to make.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't make too big of a deal about it. Just shoot for transcending all dualities.

How can you know that the thoughts you conjure up and the actions you take are independent from all the information you have taken in from other people and resources?

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course you cannot ever be totally independent of your sources and influences, but that is not really a problem.
</p>

<p>
	All that's important is that you don't follow others too closely and diversify your sources.
</p>

<p>
	Keep a healthy distance from your teachers/gurus. Learn from them but follow your own path.
</p>

<p>
	Don't go crawling up your teacher's butthole. Don't go live with them. Don't go work for them. Don't go sleep with them.
</p>

<p>
	This is just such obvious stuff. Yet people blindly do it and then act shocked when they get hurt.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, if you let your guru stick his dick inside you, you will regret it. That was your fault really for letting things get that far.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to maintain healthy boundaries.
</p>

			Are you denying the existence of individual souls? Are you telling us that everybody is the same God and there is no such thing as an individual Soul? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Depends on how you look at it.
</p>

<p>
	At the highest level of consciousness a soul is none other than God. So in this sense there is no soul. All souls are just partitions in the mind of God and made of nothing.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			If everybody is God, then how can God, that is perfect, be submissive to illusion? If the soul equals to God, then how can the individual Soul find itself subject to the limiting effects of illusion? Doesn't that lead to the conclusion that illusion is superior to God because it has the power to put God under illusion?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The answer to this set of questions must of course be riddled with paradox since we are now talking about the Absolute using dualiatic language.
</p>

<p>
	If God is unlimited, it must be unlimited in its ability to limit itself, otherwise it would not be unlimited. If God could not constrain itself inside an illusion if its own making, that would be a limit, which contradicts its unlimitedness. This God is so all-powerful it can fool itself. Illusion is not superior to God because God wills the illusion into existence, and also because there is no difference between illusion and reality, superior and inferior. All of these differences only exist in the mind of God and nowhere else.
</p>

<p>
	God IS the power of infinite illusion. Illuison IS creation! Illusion IS God's greatest power.
</p>

<p>
	If you just imagine an infinite mind, you can easily see that this mind can easily imagine being a finite thing, like a table or a kangaroo or a human. Just as you as a human adult can imagine yourself to be a child. It's easy to imagine something less than you, hard to imagine something greater than you. It's hard for a donkey to imagine God, but easy for God to imagine a donkey.

<p>
	My point is precisely: No!
</p>

<p>
	Blindly following even the best human being of all time will result in evil.
</p>

<p>
	Goodness is not a function of content, but structure. Conformity is the structure of evil.
</p>

<p>
	Blind following is what created mankind's greatest evils. The core problem is blindness. If you are blind, you will commit evil. Nothing can compensate for being blind. And no one can make you see but yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like fair criticism.
</p>

<p>
	What must be remembered is that self-bias, survival, self-deception, partialness, and incompleteness are unescapable aspects of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	The desire to follow Ken Wilber blindly rather than thinking independently for yourself is the crucial mistake. Trying to join and follow groups too closely is the key mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Why on Earth would anyone want to join some "integral institute" and follow the work of one man blindly?
</p>

<p>
	Everything must be thought through for yourself.
</p>
