	It can be negative, but it can also be healthy and positive. If you value improving your country for the benefit of all citizens, that's a good thing. If you turn it into nationalism, that's a toxic thing.
</p>

<p>
	I didn't want to exclude stage Blue people. Many of them value service to country/culture. Yes, it can become toxic, but doesn't have to.

	Because there are 1000x less helicopters than cars in that 100 mile area.
</p>

<p>
	Helicopters are an elite mode of transport, like how carriages used to be. If you are the only one driving around in a carriage because you're so rich only you can afford it, then yeah, you'll be very safe. Until everyone else gets a horse-less carriage.

			They're branching out into Spirituality now. I think in 5 years or so Tyler's videos will probably be a bit like the videos you now make tbh. I watched Tyler's latest video recently and its a trippy walk through the woods whilst it goes from day to night talking about karma and shit.
		</p>

		<p>
			To me it almost looks like he has seen your videos and want to do something like them in the coming years. I also get the feeling he might be inspired by the Conversations With God books and wants to use his fame/infamy to do good things in the future with his business. I could be wrong, its just the sense that I got watching his most recent video.<br />

<p>
	It is funny because I got the idea to start Actualized.org from watching Tyler's earliest videos. He was a sort of pioneer of early YouTube marketing.
</p>

<p>
	I even approached him in person back in 2012 to start a self-actualization channel but he was too into pickup back then to go all-in on personal development and spirituality. His plan was to exhaust pickup fully and then go all-in on personal dev. (Or so I think.)
</p>

<p>
	I think deep down he has a good heart and he would make an amazing warrior sage. But he's also got a really massive ego. Hard to tell how that will hash out. I wish him full God-realization. If he ever attains full God-realization he will become a powerful, powerful Bodhisattva and a source of light unto the world. But will it actually happen? That's the question.
</p>

<p>
	My guess is yes, but it will be an ordeal and take a long time.

			It must be really exhausting having to deal with creepy guys hitting on you all the time. In any case, no self-respecting woman would date some random guy who came up to her on the street. I think this article says it all:

<p>
	Men have been hitting on women since the dawn of time. It ain't about to stop. It's merely a question of: Will they do it skillfully or unskillfully?
</p>

<p>
	What's more disgusting is online incels who are too afraid to even talk to a woman, blame women, and then go shoot up an elementary school because they can't get laid. But of course even that is not disgusting. It's totally understandable.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate how strong the sex drive is in men. It will not just sit quietly. Either it will be channeled in a healthy way or an extremely unhealthy way. Men who can't figure out a healthy way of getting laid will create social disturbance, start wars and fascist movements. In this sense RSD is helping the world to avoid that.

	I know your struggle. But there's only so much time in the day to teach.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is a journey. You must struggle through it to get it, and then transcend it. Just begin with the mountains of material that's already on YT. You'll figure it out if you try. And enjoy the process. Don't make it just about the results.

		<p>
			Okay, I do agree with what you said here. However, there are a couple of issues I still have with learning good game.
		</p>

		<p>
			The first concern I have is that learning good game still might turn a guy into a stoic being who is forced to mask all of the pain of rejection and uncertainty he has to deal with on a constant basis. What if he reaches a certain point where he can no longer handle anymore rejection from women. Back when I approached hundreds of girls and tried connecting with countless girls on online dating websites and other social media platforms, I got to a point where I felt my self esteem and confident drop so much and I got so exhausted with having to pretend that I was okay with being constantly rejected. I felt so worthless and incredibly frustrated and indignant about dating. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There's always ways you can screw something up or make it into a dysfunction.
</p>

<p>
	You are taking rejection too personally because you're so desperate for success. Your neediness becomes its own hell.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta learn to date in a less needy way.  Go to the nightclub/bar and enjoy yourself for once. Enjoy being there. Enjoy talking to new people. Try not to make it a chore or something you do to get a score.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			The second concern I have has to do with working on my social skills. While it’s all sounds good that being a confident and masculine man is what makes you attractive to women, having strong masculinity and solid confidence isn’t actually enough to date and sleep with a great amount of the kind of women you want. Unfortunately, you need to also have a good level of social skills to achieve the results you truly desire with women. Yes, we all need to have at least an average level of social skills to properly get along with others at least at a normal functioning level, respect other people’s boundaries, acknowledge and comply with authority, read and understand non-verbal cues given by the person or people you’re talking to, act with at least a certain level of dignity, learn how to be kind/sympathetic/empathetic with others, etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, learning social skills is key. It's perhaps even more important and fundamental than dating itself. Your larger goal should be to learn how to socialize effortlessly. This comes with lots of practice. Simply by being more social you will attract lots of women automatically. The biggest reason for incels is that they simply aren't social enough. And Facebook and Reddit don't count as being social here.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			However, what about learning the techniques or methods to be more charismatic such as good story telling, humor/wit, being good at starting a conversation, transitioning conversation topics smoothly, having deep, meaningful conversations that invoke emotions in others, etc.? Wouldn’t learning and practicing all of those techniques eventually turn you into a people pleasing entertainer?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	These are all great things. Yes, master them all. No, learning those things will not turn you into a people pleasing entertainer. It will just make you much more magnetic and comfortable in conversation. You will also enjoy your conversations more, not just with women but with men and everyone.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are good at conversation, conversation becomes enjoyable for its own sake. Then you have the best of both worlds. Women and men will flock to you. Who doesn't love a good conversationalist/story-teller?
</p>

<p>
	Have you ever met a really good conversationalist who drew you in for hours?

	What devilry is this?!
</p>

<p>
	Of course "you" want a dark theme. Of course! Everywhere the light shines you want darkness.
</p>

<p>
	And are you satisfied with cloaking yourself in darkness? No! You must lure everyone else into your darkness to keep you company.
</p>

<p>
	And you expect to be thanked for this.

<p>
	Clever devil.

<p>
	I didn't create a miracle. But I was so conscious that I could literally change reality simply via infinite imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Like, I could imagine a drop of divine water falling on a sick person's head and healing or awakening him. Because at that level of consciousness it is totally clear that physical reality is just my imagination and I can imagine it any way I want.
</p>

<p>
	I understood how someone like Jesus could heal. He just imagined it.
</p>

<p>
	I'm still toying around with this stuff. Mastering it would take a lot of work.

<p>
	1) It can!
</p>

<p>
	2) Precisely because it is already happpening. Remember, if you ask for an apple, you will get an apple, not an orange. Right now you are so busy materializing apples yet you're asking why you don't have oranges.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is your current state of consciousness is far too low to allow you to change how you are materializing physical reality. If your state was 1,000,000 times higher, you could change that.
</p>

<p>
	I have been so conscious that miracles become possible. But this is not a state I can sustain (yet). It's utterly radical. You are not human any more at those levels of consciousness. People will preceive you as an alien. And they will come after you with pitchforks.
</p>

<p>
	This is dangerous territory, and ripe for abuse.
</p>

<p>
	If there is, I haven't reached it yet.
</p>

<p>
	I would define too much awakening as awakening so high that you are on the brink of leaving the physical avatar permanently. That's where I would draw the line.
</p>

<p>
	Although, if you ever reach that point, would you even care? The only reason to stay behind would be to help others awaken, or maybe if you had young kids.

<p>
	Because compassion. Compassion is never mandatory, but if you are conscious, it naturally comes when you see tragedy.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to care about millions of people who you don't even know exist.
</p>

<p>
	But of course in the absolute sense Kobe's life was no more important than an ant's. But humans are self-biased creatures. And killing a queen ant has an outsized impact on the other ants.
</p>

<p>
	If you think about it objectively, it really is amazing that Kobe got so famous and rich for throwing balls into baskets. That says a lot about what humanity values and our level of development. People don't like to question the obvious.

			Hey Leo, what do you think is the best way to pace yourself when doing all this personal development + Spiritual growth work? I'm pretty new to the forum and I'm quite astonished to read about all the things I don't know about its quite mind-boggling and it feels overwhelming. I'm currently meditating at least once a day for an hour or more and reading as much of the books on the booklist. I feel like slow in steady seems to be the way. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's almost impossible to answer that. Everyone's path is so unique. The most important thing is not to do what I tell you, but to go inside yourself, connect with your heart, and listen to what it tells you you should do next.
</p>

<p>
	You want to get good at leading yourself and following your own compass (intuiton and heart). You do this by going into solitude and quiet contemplation, and asking yourself powerful questions that open your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Reading those books and watching videos is a good launching off point. You need to arm yourself with quality information and ideas of what's possible and what's worthwhile to pursue. Don't be afraid to invest a few years just reading, watching, and taking notes. You need a decent vision of where you're headed and why.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, slow and steady is key. Be a tortoise not a hare.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The context of this thread was asking about how gender can be relative. So my response is to point people to the fact that absolutely everything is relative. That's what everything is, pure relativity.
</p>

<p>
	A deep contemplation of what relativity is, is crucial in this work. Maybe give that a try some day. You might be amazed at what you find <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	The difference between a kangaroo and a BMW is relative. Can you get a hit on that?

<title>Could learning game turn you into a people pleaser with low self-esteem?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44863-could-learning-game-turn-you-into-a-people-pleaser-with-low-self-esteem/?do=findComment&amp;comment=563890</link>

<p>
	There are right and wrong ways to learn game.
</p>

<p>
	If you're doing good game, your goal is to develop authenticity and inner strength. You're not trying to please the girl at all. If you go in trying to please the girl, that's bad game, and she will smell it and reject you. With good game you're not being fake to trick her into liking you, you're working on yourself as a many to burn off all your fear and weakness so that when she's talking to you, you actually are a highly attractive, strong, valuable man. And then she falls in love. She's not falling in love with a fake or a people-pleaser. If anything, game will make you icy and detached. You will stop caring what people think of you. And then your game will shoot through the roof because women find that so attractive.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, after your entire gaming journey is complete, what you'll discover is that nothing is more attractive than genuinely and FULLY being yourself. That's all game is. But when you start you are so self-conscious and so inauthentic that you have no idea what FULLY being yourself means. Game is a process of a many discovering himself. And then women get attracted like flies on shit.
</p>

<p>
	If you can just be 100% fully authentically yourself without an ounce of fear or embarrassment in front of a hot woman, that's all you need to sleep with her. It really is that simple. But it's also really hard to pull off if you're a socially awkward guy with little dating experience who secrete hates himself for all his flaws.
</p>

<p>
	All you need is to be able to walk up to a beautiful women, look her straight in the eyes like you want to fuck her, and then proceed to have a fun playful relaxed conversation, charged with a tinge of sexual energy. Easier said than done. Real game is about training yourself to be able to do that.
</p>

	RSD was one of the best back in the 2012ish era when I was big into it. Not sure about what they teach today since I haven't watched in a long while.
</p>

<p>
	Was it highly conscious? No. But it worked for getting good with the ladies.
</p>

<p>
	But there are many, many dating and attraction courses and teachers out there. I've studied dozens of different ones. Hard to remember them all. David DeAneglo is a classic. I studied Adam Lyons, David Wygant, Mystery Method (although it's super outdated), and a bunch more that I can't recall now.
</p>

<p>
	The basic theory is very simple: you go to a crowded place where there are many hot women, you see one, you muster the courage to approach her, and you start talking your mouth off. Smile, be playful, strong eye contact, have sexual intent, get good a touching her early without being creepy. Repeat 10,000 times. The rest is fine details. Roll with experienced wingmen who can show you the ropes in-person.

<p>
	Actualized.org can never go mainstream. Any politicians associated with me would be viciously smeared, so it's best to keep me away from them.
</p>

<p>
	Mainstream people are never going to accept the things I teach, so their only option will be to smear as a self-defense mechanism.
</p>

<p>
	When you're dealing with politics, you're dealing with appeals to people on a very low-brow, shallow level.
</p>

<p>
	Just look at the backlash Bernie got for Joe Rogan's endorsement. It will would be an order of magnitude worse with me because I say far more threatening things than Joe Rogan.
</p>

But that is an exception, not the norm. In most such cases the wounds will be carried to the grave.
</p>

<p>
	All karma can be overcome. But that's a very tall order for most folks to fill.
</p>

<p>
	And also, you must consider, How deeply were you indoctrinated into Christianity? There are many degrees of it. Some people got it real bad.
</p>

<p>
	Technically I was raised Orthodox Christian. But I got a very mild form of it, and I was too conscious from the get-go to buy that shit. The relativity of religion is too obvious after a certain point of consciousness. It's obviouy not possible for any one religion to be Truth to the exclusion of all the others. Just as it's obvious that English cannot be the truest language. There simply is no such thing.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who thinks Christianty is the truest relgion simply reveals their lack of study and contemplation of other religions. It's pure self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that only Jesus had the highest access to God is comically naive and goes against the very core of what God is -- ONENESS.
</p>

<p>
	It is devirly to claim that anyone has an exclusive or highest access to God.
</p>

<p>
	It is the oldest trick in the book to claim that one's religion is the highest. Children think this way.

<p>
	The Infinite Good is all things. You can't improve it because it is already the sum total of all possible improvements you could think of.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is always Perfect, but you don't see it that way because you are self-biased and are attached to things going your human way. If you surrendered your attachment to life, you would see Perfection everywhere.

	EXACTLY!

<p>
	I am not denying that you can experience the masculine or feminine, but all of that is relative.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this is the Absolute perspective, but that is what's missing here.
</p>

<p>
	You are still subtly trying to ground reality in that duality, which keeps you from going as deep as you could.
</p>

<p>
	There is a deeper level of understanding by transcending that.

<p>
	Sounds to me like in your case it's not just "some", it's a whole fucking truckload. Emotional problems easily manifest as physical problems. In such a case, treating them physically will not bring lasting relief.

<p>
	You're in luck. For females it should be easier because your sexuality is much more in the mind than of the physical act (like most guys).
</p>

<p>
	Via hypnosis I know it is possible to give females a male ejaculatory orgasm: where you imagine having a penis and using it to ejaculate.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of exotic types of orgasms are possible with females via hypnosis, but it usually requires a knowledgeable guy to lead it. Although if you really wanted to you could probably lead yourself. Unfortunately for you ladies there are very few men who you date who have this knowledge or even an interest in it.
</p>

<p>
	I took an entire course on sexual hypnosis.

<p>
	Not ready to reveal such things yet. I think it also varies from person to person. People react differently to the same substances, so it take exploration to find what will work for you.

<p>
	It's not a function of money. They are simply paradigm locked and do not fully understand how relativity works.
</p>

<p>
	They can't help it. Someone who was raised in a Christian household has been so deeply programmed by Christian symbolism from such an early age it's almost impossible to let that attachment go. It forms the kernel of the OS which runs that mind.
</p>

<p>
	Even if one of these Christians turns to Buddhism or explores the New Age, deep in their mind they will still have a resonance for Christian symbolism. Their mind has been imprinted with that karma.

<p>
	Psychedelics certainly help. There are some which are very erotic which are perfect for this. I got very close to having a female oragsm once. I don't doubt it's possible with more practice. But even if you aren't able to actually have one, just getting close is very powerful and healing as it integrates your feminine side.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise there are other methods like hypnosis and visualization.
</p>

<p>
	Visualization is an extremely powerful tool. You can visualize so hard that you can materialize a diety into your perceptual field. But of course this is not your regular visualization exercise. This is hardcore stuff that requires serious commitment and practice.
</p>

<p>
	I think every guy should try to have at least 1 female orgasm just to open his mind. And don't confuse female orgasm with anal sex. That's not what I'm talking about.
</p>

	Hehe... yes! Mind raped by God.

<p>
	Get used to it.
</p>

<p>
	This is why we keep saying you must integrate masculine and feminine. This is very important.
</p>

<p>
	As a male, try to actually experience what a female orgasm feels like and enjoy it. You have to get over this idea that you are a male. You are not male! You are God pretending to be male.

<p>
	That's not the real reason. You're not appreciating the relativity of perspective. From the Clinton's perspective they do good for the world. Of course that doesn't excuse some of the bad stuff they do, but they don't do it for money, they do it because they believe that's the kind of governance the world needs, AND it also makes them good money. Of course they aligned those two things in their worldview in a convenient manner. You can disagree with that since you're a progressive. But it's not as simple as doing stuff for money. And don't forget that the Clintons also did a lot of good stuff for the world. Governance is a tricky and dirty business. Don't expect people to have clean records.
</p>

<p>
	It's problematic to look back to the 90's and judge it by today's progressive standards. The Democratic party has evolved a lot. And that evolution sits on an older foundation which was the Clintons. Like it or not that's how progress happens.

<p>
	To be clear, a rock does not have gender unless you project it there.
</p>

<p>
	In truth nothing has gender. Gender is an imaginary category, as all categories are.
</p>

<p>
	If you find gender in a rock, you put it there.
</p>

<p>
	If you find gender in a human, you put it there.
</p>

<p>
	You put everything everywhere. Otherwise it couldn't exist. Because you are God.
</p>

<p>
	But this takes some SERIOUS consciousness to grasp. Nothing short of awakening will do.

	Maybe so, but that ain't fascism, that's corporatism -- a stage or two above.
</p>

<p>
	CNN does speak out against fascists like white supremacy movements. No CNN anchor would equivocate about that. They would call it beyond the pale. They would not spin to justify it, unlike Fox News. Fox News would find some way to defend it.

<p>
	So easy. Imagine an adult you hugging a sad suffering child you.
</p>

<p>
	And many other visualizations are possible. Like loving your entire life, body, and mind exactly as it is.

<p>
	Hangovers could be due to lack of nutrients for the brain. Fuel yourself up with antioxidants and other brain supplements after the trip. I've heard this can really help with MDMA hangovers, which means it should also work on all types of hangovers.

<p>
	This is when it's good to remember the relativity of reproduction. His biological offspring may be gone, but his impact on society won't be so easily erased.

	Note to all aspiring rich people: when you get rich, don't buy a helicopter.

	I am done replying to this thread.
</p>

<p>
	I have spoken the truth. Now it's on you to do the work to get it.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that these are extremely advanced teachings. Treat them with the respect and nuance they deserve. It will take the average person 10 to 20 years of serious inner work to fully fathom what was said in this thread. Sloppiness, laziness, and self-bias just won't cut it here.

<p>
	Two basic solutions to this problem:
</p>

<p>
	1) Practice Self-Love. Using visualization, give yourself the love that your wish your mother gave you. Give yourself unlimited love. Give yourself the love you which any woman or girlfriend would give you. Do this for 10 minutes every day for several months. It will make a big difference.
</p>

<p>
	2) Go attract some women and have sex with them. Get a girlfriend.
</p>

<p>
	After you do steps 1 & 2, your problem should be gone. If not, repeat steps 1 & 2.
</p>

<p>
	Politicians digging up dirt on opponents is par for the course.
</p>

<p>
	What's not okay though is if the dirt-digging discovers actual serious dirt.
</p>

<p>
	Like if your opponent discovers you murdered someone, well, that means you're disqualified from the job. It isn't really dirt if it's true that you murdered someone.
</p>

<p>
	The problems with Trump are not merely his sexual scandals and tabloid dirt. It's the fact that he's seriously corrupt as fuck.

You will not be able to self-actualized effectively if you are enmeshed in a regressive family situation. If you're a teen, it's okay. You can still do lots of inner work without making it known to people. But aim to move out and spread your wings.
</p>

<p>
	Most families are pretty barbaric, regressive, and dysfunctional. So don't worry too much about it. As a teen your job is to manage the best you can given that situation until you're able to move out. You still have a 60 years of growth ahead of you. You are already ahead of the curve just by knowing about self-actualization and spirituality.

<p>
	You need to research all the cures that have been found for ADHD.
</p>

<p>
	They are out there. Many of them. Do the research and get your health in order.
</p>

<p>
	If you have an underlying physical issue like heavy metal toxicity or some vitamin deficiency, no amount of meditation technique is going to overcome that. Meditation technique assumes you have a solid healthy body/brain/mind to work with.
</p>

<p>
	Don't just assume that ADHD is some genetic condition handed down to you by God. It's probably a consequence of improper lifestyle.

<p>
	You need to learn to set boundaries and communicate your values and boundaries to people rather than acting silent or passive aggressive.
</p>

<p>
	Better communication is crucial.
</p>

<p>
	People-pleasing is a common problem. It's worth taking the time to work that out in yourself. You don't want to live as a people-pleaser your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	Once you solve your people-pleasing, then you will be able to effectively communicate and enforce your values and boundaries with people, and you won't have to ignore them or suffering silently.

<p>
	By that silly logic you can also say:
</p>

<p>
	"Why not murder a few people? There are 8 billion people on the planet. It will have effectively 0 impact."
</p>

<p>
	"Why not rape a few people? There are 8 billion people on the planet. It will have effectively 0 impact."

<p>
	"Why not burn down a few houses? There are billions houses on the planet. It will have effectively 0 impact."
</p>

<p>
	"Why not shit in the street? It's only one shit out of billions. It will have effectively 0 impact."
</p>

<p>
	Any one thing has effectively zero impact in the universe. And yet your actions still matter.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	In practice, many US elections end up being very close. Most US elections are with 1%-5%. So your vote is not really lost in a seas of millions of others. Every election cycle we have recounts somewhere because the vote difference is so small. Sometimes by a thousand or less votes.
</p>

<p>
	Trump only won by about 70,000 votes in a few key areas.
</p>

<p>
	And local elections are even closer. They usually have under 100,000 votes total. 1000 votes is enough to make the difference in a local election. So your vote counts a lot more than you think.

<p>
	Most of them aren't celebrities so you won't hear about them.

</p>

<p>
	I would look for an energetic / psychic healer in your town who you can talk to. Try out several of them to find one you resonate with and go as often as you can. They usually cost: $70 - $150 / session.
</p>

<p>
	This is something you'll want another person to help you with. The worst thing for you is to be too isolated and not around high-consciousness people. You need someone who can help you shift your energy around and show you new perspectives on life.
</p>

<p>
	I would not rely too much on traditional medical professionals. They rarely understand the root issues of things. Clearly there is mental trauma that you're struggling with. Some drug is not going to magically fix it.
</p>

<p>
	I also recommend you get thorough bloodwork testing. Find out if there's anything missing. Also check for heavy metal toxicity via provoked urine testing. Heave metals in the brain can cause all sorts of problems like this. Get your health and nutrition in order. Do detox protocols. Liver detox, kidney detox, heavy metal detox, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And overall I just recommend you do A LOT of research into your condition. Search the web, buy books on this exact issue, read, take notes, find people who have successfully cured  themselves and copy what they did. Research is crucial. You need to understand this condition in and out. And not just what traditional medicine says. Look into all sorts of alternative medicine approaches.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry, not much advice I can offer besides this as I don't specialize in these kinds of issues.
</p>

<p>
	I would also add:
</p>

<p>
	1) Psychedelics might save your life
</p>

<p>
	2) Start practicing self-love immediately. You need to open your heart, live more from your heart not your head, and forgive yourself and fully accept and love yourself exactly as you are. See a psychic healer who can show you how to get out of your head and reside in your heart. The heart doesn't contain all those thoughts. Find some guided meditations which shift you into your heart and use those religiously.
</p>

<p>
	3) Neurofeedback brain training could also be very effective for such a condition. You can search for neurofeedback centers and specialists in your town. Every major town has them. A dozen of those sessions could cure you or at least reduce your suffering.
</p>

<p>
	4) Hypnosis might also be very effective. Look for hypnotherapists in your town.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness & insight

<p>
	Also, your message needs to FIT your audience. This is key. You can apply Spiral Dynamics here. If you're speaking to a stage Orange audience, a New Age vision of meeting God will only annoy them. However, a vision of success, personal improvement, science, technology, money, sex, business, big muscles, fast cars, big houses, luxury shopping -- that will excite them. Conversely, if you're talking to a group of hippies, a vision of fast cars and luxury shopping will fall flat on its face.

	The most important function of cooking is to kill parasites.
</p>

<p>
	Undeveloped tribes have massive parasite problems.
</p>

<p>
	People in the developed world do not appreciate how bad parasites can get because we've virtually wiped them out with cooked and processed foods.

<p>
	Imagine a foot long tape worm in your gut. That's what you get when you live off the land in some jungle.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, interpretations vary. Interpretations are not the Absolute itself. But also they are.
</p>

<p>
	The paradoxes here are unavoidable because the Absolute cannot be captured in any finite symbolic order, since the Absolute is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	When you are directly conscious of the Absolute, you become it. You are not interpreting it, thinking about it, or even looking at it. You and it become ONE. Then you can come back down into duality and do interpretations and analysis on it. But when you're doing that, you're again disconnected from it. Yet at the same time you cannot ever be disconnected from it because it is all things at all times.

<p>
	No!

<p>
	Truth = Absolute
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is singular and the same for everyone.

<p>
	And here's the mindfuck: there is nothing but Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as falsehood or untruth. Just different degrees of confusion about the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is so total that is includes within it all "falsehoods" because it is them.
</p>

<p>
	If anything I said in this thread confuses you or leaves you skeptical, you need to study nondual literature (see my book list for ideas). You're lacking a basic conceptual understanding of nonduality.

<p>
	God/Absolute is a tautology. There is no alternative to the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	How your mind interprets the Absolute can vary, but the Absolute itself, Truth itself, Oneness, is the same for everyone. Hence it's called Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute means it doesn't change under any circumstances.

	After that you ARE Love. You are already dead and there is nothing left to do but play. You are no longer in control. God is doing God.

You are in the eternal mind of God. Forever here in every moment. Infinity. The one and only Creator. Alone by yourself forever. Perfection, heaven, paradise.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I recognize that bhakti is one path out of many for some people. I recognize the relativity of all paths to awakening. The question is, do you?
</p>

<p>
	Personally it's a path I don't resonate with. Or, you could say I am doing bhakti yoga, but my deity is reality itself, not any one classic avatar. My devotion is to Truth and Consciousness in their pure, abstract, formless form.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to pray to elephant-man, knock yourself out.
</p>

<p>
	My only question for you at the end of all that will be: are you conscious that your elephant-man is imaginary and that you are God? If not, your path hasn't taken you all the way.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is this: if you spend years praying to elephant-man, when I tell you that your elephant-man is imaginary, you are very likely to get upset and angry and defensive because if it was imaginary, why did you spend all those years praying to it? And that's exactly my point.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than dicking around with elephant-man, why not cut straight to the chase: You are God imagining all of reality. There is no higher truth than this. Devote yourself to realizing that. And that will be the highest bhakti.
</p>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10453-moon777light/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="10453" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/10453-moon777light/" rel="">@moon777light</a> Good. That was a nice newbie intro. Your mind is still very chaotic and random, which is why you had all those wacky visions.
</p>

<p>
	As you do more, you must learn to focus your mind and contemplate the nature of reality rather than just going on joyride visions.
</p>

<p>
	Visions are fun, scary, and interesting, but what really matters is getting down to understanding what consciousness is, and what YOU are.
</p>

<p>
	So far you got a tiny taste of what consciousness can do: it is infinite imagination -- which is why you're able to have all those wacky visions. But you don't yet comprehend what consciousness in itself is and why it is here, or all of its many facets. You also probably don't understand how conscious in the trip connects with consciousness in "material reality". You have to build an intellectual bridge between your trips and "real life" until you realize that your "real life" is just another trip.
</p>

<p>
	Keep your future doses low. You have much more to learn at these lower doses. Mushrooms can be extremely challenging at the 4g range and above. At 4g+ your old life and reality will start to completely disappear and you will enter the phantasms of your mind. Since your mind is chaotic and impure and lacks nondual understanding, you will encounter all sorts of horrors of your own imagination and you will start to go insane. 2 grams is a good solid dose to do lots of work with without totally freaking yourself out.
</p>

<p>
	Try contemplating questions next time like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is consciousness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?

	The next time you trip, realize that whatever your mind imagines gets materialized. If you start to think of elephants you will see elephants on the carpet. Wonder why does this happen? It happens because you are God imagining the world and the psychedelic removes the shackles on Infinite Mind.

	Finally, turn your gaze directly inwards and ask, "What am I?!"

<title>Closing in Game</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44638-closing-in-game/?do=findComment&amp;comment=562521</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Closing is a very specific skill set.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to just date randomly and see what happens, go ahead. But you'll lose lots of girls. If you're okay with that, fine. But most guys would get very frustrated and want to construct an optimized skill set to deal with the repeated challenges.
</p>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4457-elisabeth/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="4457" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/4457-elisabeth/" rel="">@Elisabeth</a> I understand your disgust, but you also have to see the relativity of the situation. Dating for men and for women is very different. This advice doesn't make sense from a woman's perspective but it does from the man's. You have to appreciate how much rejection the man has to deal with. It's not like the man can only approach one girl and make it happen. He has to approach hundreds. That process by its very nature is mechanical and objectifying, not just of the woman but also for the man. Imagine approaching 100 people and getting rejected 95 times. What do you do? Imagine that out of 100 approaches you get 5 people to like you and agree to come home with you because it's the world's perfect match. A match made in heaven. But then 4 in 5 times the person's friends will come and drag them away and you will never speak to them again. What do you do when facing such odds?
</p>

<p>
	See, from the woman's POV none of this is noticed as a problem because you play the selector role and you don't have to do 100s of approaches. From your POV, one right approach is all it takes because you are on the receiving end of the approach. So from your selfish POV you think a guy should invest tons of energy into one approach. But from the guy's POV it's exactly the opposite. He can't invest any energy into any one approach because most of them fail.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the relativity in self-agenda here. If you say, "But what about true love?" Yeah, that's your female self-agenda. "True love" is defined differently for a female vs a male given their reproductive asymmetries.
</p>

<p>
	Neither side is right. It's relative. It's survival. It's selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	My advice was for men, not for women. Of course women are not going to like it because if dating advice is any good it, by definition, encroaches on the other gender's self-agenda. The man's agenda is to invest less energy into the woman, the woman's agenda is to have the man invest all his energy into her alone. At least initially until a serious relationship is formed. Then things can equalize somewhat.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I feel terrible when I eat heavy carbs. That's like the worst possible meal for me, even if it is all organic, whole, and vegan. A big load of carbs hitting my gut kills my consciousness for about 2 hours.
</p>

<p>
	If eat some smoked salmon or a burger on lettuce, my consciousness and energy is smooth and consistent.
</p>

<p>
	It's so noticeable I stay away from carbs like that.
</p>

<p>
	Green veggies and fruits don't create this problem for me, but they also have so little calories that I have to be eating them every 2 hours to stay energized and not hungry -- which is highly inconvenient and impractical.
</p>

The mind wants to make shit up in order to feel certain and secure, even if the thing is totally false.
</p>

<p>
	People who predict exact dates for when the world will end get even more convinced the world will end after their dates pass and nothing happens. The ego-mind loves to double-down on its ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	If the world didn't end in 2012, surely it will end in 2013. Surely in 2014. Okay, now it definitely has to end in 2015. Okay, no later than 2016 for sure this time.

<title>Spirituality for the chronically ill</title>

</p>

<p>
	Still, of course, that doesn't mean anything goes. Some stuff you simply may not be able to heal under your limited human powers. But you'd also be amazed at how much stuff can be healed. So it's worth a try.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you can't heal a thing, you might still be able to reduce the symptoms and suffering. You can find coping strategies too.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a serious health disorder, doing lots of research and experimentation is crucial.
</p>

<title>Do you need the help of a master/guru to face ultimate death?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44733-do-you-need-the-help-of-a-masterguru-to-face-ultimate-death/?do=findComment&amp;comment=562508</link>

<p>
	This is just basic logic:
</p>

<p>
	If awakening always required a guru or teacher, nobody would be awake, since there would never be that first person to wake up (for lack of a teacher).
</p>

<p>
	Clearly at least 1 person woke up without a guru/teacher. And if one can do it, more than one can do it.
</p>

<p>
	And of course, in practice, many people have woken up independently without teachers all over the world at different times in history.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, you may benefit greatly from good a guru/teacher. Awakening independently requires hardcore motivation and commitment which very few people have.
</p>

<title>Questions about self help and spirituality.</title>

Focus first on the ordinary stuff before you start grappling with the tricky spiritual metaphysical stuff.
</p>

<p>
	As far as your real-world experience goes, you believe you are a human who has emotions and thoughts, and you believe that humans are responsible for their actions. This is what's true for you. Yes or no?
</p>

<p>
	So be honest about where you're at.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what some guru says, what matters is what's true in your experience. Some guru could tell you that you are God, but that is not your experience so don't approach life using the guru's story. Approach life as it is for you.
</p>

<p>
	If some day you realize you are not a human, then things will change for you. But that's not something you should worry about now.
</p>

<p>
	Also, spirituality tells you that you are EVERYTHING, so of course you ARE your thoughts and emotions too. You're just not only those things. Spirituality requires taking responsibility for how you create your whole reality. So there's no contradiction. But start with the easy stuff like the sentence completions.
</p>

<p>
	A collapse of what system?
</p>

<p>
	Democracy? Capitalism? Earth?
</p>

<p>
	I don't see these collapsing. There will be downturns for sure, but overall I think we aren't doing too bad. 100 more years of development will correct many of the current imbalances.
</p>

<p>
	The tide on environmental responsibility is turning. Capitalism has already clearly hit its limit and more people are open to the next stage of economics which will be a capitalist/socialist hybrid. Democracy is a bit under threat by nationalism right now, but that will not stick. Democracy should only get more democratic in the long term.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest wrench in the werks would be a nuclear detonation I think. The rest we can manage.
