	He was a regional war hero, akin to George Washington.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine how Americans would react if George Washington was assassinated by Iran. That is the situation here. Even the most moderate Iranians will now be pissed off and driven to violence because this is a matter of pride and self-respect. No self-respecting nation can allow such abuse.
</p>

<p>
	When Iranian history books are written, Soleimani will go down as their George Washington, and now a martyr at the hands of an evil empire. A generation of children will grow up hating America.
</p>

<p>
	Killing him was the worst possible strategic blunder from America's POV. Iran is now united and empassioned.

<p>
	Every US general and secretary of defense is a war criminal by the US's own logic.
</p>

<p>
	Of course top military leaders mastermine the deaths of thousands of people. That is their job.
</p>

<p>
	By the US's own logic, all top US officials are justified to be assassinated for their military planning. That's how absurdly self-biased the position is.

<p>
	Stop listening to him period. His intellect is just garbage.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who takes the likes of him or Tucker Carlson seriously is just a joke. You cannot take anything they say seriously because it is so stunningly self-biased and intectually bankrupt.
</p>

<p>
	Some people are so banrkupt that even to listen to them or engage with them seriously is already a mistake. This pretty much goes for anyone at Fox News. It's self-biased propaganda.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be listening to and debating with someone who is pro-slavery.

	This was the greatest concern about Trump now come to fruition.
</p>

<p>
	The correct wording here is: the US assassinated Iranian top leader. But notice how US media doesn't phrase it that way due to self-bias.

	Buy the Kriya Yoga books and get to work, if you're serious. Don't wait around for others to do the work for you.

<p>
	It's a small factor but nothing worth worrying about.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, reverse racism is just racism. Racism doesn't only apply to white people. Anyone can be racist.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to use the notion of reverse racism to argue that nothing needs to be done about racism or that racism doesn't exist. Which is just hogwash.

<p>
	That's your strawman of what they say. They never actually say 90%. More like 25%. Which is about right.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, they demonize the right too much sometimes. How else could Green be?
</p>

<p>
	Racism is a serious issue which the country has not yet fully addressed. There's a lot of denial going around about it still. People like to think they are more developed than they actually are.

<p>
	Your issue is more basic than meditation. Meditation is not going to fix your neediness because you're not at a level of development yet where you can even take meditation seriously.
</p>

<p>
	The advice for you is: work on your isolation, learn to socialize, build social skills, develop friends, develop dating skills, have sex, and THEN meditation will help you reach higher levels.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation is not a shortcut for avoiding learning basic survival skills like dating, making money, proper diet, etc. Meditation is a rather advanced skill for people who have already become proficient at survival and want to reach the next level.
</p>

<p>
	Once you've had a bunch of sex and made a bunch of money, then you ask, "Okay, what's next?" That's where meditation starts to look appealing.

<p>
	Don't assume that. Most people here don't meditate or meditate so ineffectively that they might as well be watching TV.
</p>

<p>
	Serious meditation is a rare skill that very few people practice.
</p>

<p>
	And meditation takes years to pay off.

<p>
	If you put a stage Orange person in a Green environment, they are likely to not fit in and have falling out. Which is what happened.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not so simplistic as to say that if you put an Orange person into a higher environment he will automatically grow into it. Many people will have a backlash and entrench themselves in their old stage.
</p>

<p>
	If TYT hired a white supremacist, he would probably quit in short order and start his own white supremacy YT channel.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I think it describes his behavior very well.
</p>

<p>
	Since a solid Orange person is very much driven by personal success and profit, it makes a lot of sense that Rubin would dump TYT and its values to start his own show and make a big name for himself speaking out against liberals as a gay dude.
</p>

<p>
	It seems that Rubin's work at TYT was not based on deeply held Green values but a desire to make it in online media. Which is a very Orange thing. And that's exactly why he didn't fit in there and why he's doing his current show.
</p>

<p>
	He wasn't developed enough to last at TYT.
</p>

<p>
	This is easily evidenced by his last of understanding of Green values and his libertarianism.
</p>

<p>
	Yellow? Ha!
</p>

<p>
	He's stuck in Orange with a big Green shadow.
</p>

<p>
	He didn't see the limits of Green. Just as he started getting exposed to Green he couldn't handle it and doubled-down on Orange.
</p>

<p>
	He is criticizing Green from below, not above.

<p>
	Every story you construct will come crashing down on your head one day, because you are building castles in the sky.

	And to defend those stories you will of course become a devil. Because the truth is, they are all fictions you've invented to suit your ego's survival.

	JP carefully avoids serious discussions of policy. He's focused on culture wars to distract from real issues like corporate corruption, environmental destruction, military-industrial complex, gross income inequality, gerrymandering, voter suppression, suppression of unions, anti-trust violations, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Because in his world these are not important issues. His world revolves around silly happenings on college campuses. You can't make a good career out of talking about serous policy issues. It's much easier to make a career out of being a cultural warrior who wages a lesser Jihad.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental conservative position is that things are basically fine if we just return to the way things were and stop rocking the boat with progressive ideas. The need for structural reform isn't evident to them because they are busy defending the system to which they have hitched their identity.
</p>

<p>
	A Christian doesn't see a need to reform Christianity, he sees the evils of Islam instead.
</p>

<p>
	A scientists doesn't see a need to reform science, he sees the evils of religion instead.
</p>

<p>
	A democrat doesn't see a need to reform the democrat party, he sees the evils of republicans instead.
</p>

<p>
	This is classic self-deception: create a distraction by projecting the problem outward at some scapegoat. Meanwhile, no deep self-reflection is done and no real internal structure change is made -- which his exactly what the ego wants.
</p>

<p>
	JP doesn't want to seriously investigate the structural limitations of capitalism. So he scapegoats liberals as Neo-Marxists which creates a loud flashy sideshow that draws in a crowd of mouth-breathers who also have no interest in a deep analysis of capitalism. As that would actually require some mental and emotional labor. It would be scary and unsettling to admit that maybe you are part of a corrupt and mindless capitalist regime that perpetuates the needless suffering of millions. Especially if that regime earns you good money and feeds your children.

	Well, that's not gonna happen. Even the idea of a safe space is already ridiculed and demonized by the right-wing. And they are certainly incapable of non-judgment and non-criticism. As are most left-wingers.

	Yup, I get that too. Listening to aggressive ignorance really tests one's patience and compassion. That's the challenge of our work. How do you deal with people who are so closedminded and ignorant that they might be willing to kill you for speaking truth?

<p>
	Of course, otherwise it would have been resolved a thousand years ago. These are profound existential challenges of a cosmic order requiring millions of deaths to understand and transcend. This is life and death stuff we're dealing with. It doesn't get any more serious than this.
</p>

<p>
	And yet ironically it's all a joke in the end.
</p>

<p>
	We (God) are stuck in an existential bind of infinite proportion.

	Suffering sits deeper than belief.
</p>

<p>
	When the suffering gets strong enough, all your pretty beliefs will fly out the window. Then only consciousness can prevail. And even that will flag and wane for most people. Only training of consciousness can overcome that.

			Who cares if the suffering is imaginary when it feels real and causes me all this pain?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The point is precisely that if you were conscious that suffering is imaginary, it would stop being painful.
</p>

<p>
	But you're not conscious of that, so it is still painful for you.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between believing that suffering is imaginary vs actually being conscious of it at the moment of the torture. This work is not done at the level of belief.
</p>

<p>
	So you're right in that there is no point in believing that reality is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	But you're wrong in that that's not what I'm suggesting you to do. I'm suggesting you to become CONSCIOUS of it. Which is a totally different thing. You are not anywhere near being conscious of it yet. This seems like a word game because for you it IS only a word game. But I am telling you there is something beyond the word game which you are not yet aware of. If you ever go beyond the word game, that's where you'll feel the difference.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine becoming so conscious that you can no longer be physically killed. That's what we're talking about here. Obviously this cannot happen as a matter of belief. You must actually become physically unkillable. How is such a thing possible? Well, if you knew how, you'd already be immortal. So of course it won't make much sense from your current vantage point. You have to be willing to go radically outside the box of what you consider reality to be.
</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that your ego will try to keep all of these teachings safely at the level of word games. Because then the ego is never threatened. The challenge in this work is to make sure you're actually doing the work, not just thinking about it. Thinking about doing the work is not the same as doing the work. Talking about enlightenment is not enlightenment. Thinking about reality being an illusion is not the same as experiencing it as such in every moment.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between talking about having a million dollars vs actually having one million in cash in your closet.
</p>

		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	You are confusing two things: truth and what your ego wants. Spirituality in its purest form means more truth, whatever that entails. It might entail an early death (as in the case of Jesus) or a long life (as in the case of The Buddha). But truth is truth regardless of its consequences on the ego.
</p>

<p>
	The point is not that spirituality ultimately leads to less stability, the opposite is the case if you do it right. The problem is that there are many traps, many ways to screw it up along the way. And even if you tell people about all the traps, they will still not listen and fall into them.
</p>

<p>
	But also don't forget the many dangers of not doing this work. It's not as though your life will go smoothly if you avoid this work. The opposite is the case.

<title>Leo's Work Is Becoming Dangerous</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/43949-leos-work-is-becoming-dangerous/?do=findComment&amp;comment=552079</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The topics we deal with here are inherently dangerous and could not be otherwise since they involve undoing and transcending survival.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is very dangerous to the ego-mind. These dangers are not merely perceptual, they are also "actual", in the sense of physical danger. You can't do serious spiritual work and also complain, "But this can be dangerous". Of course! If it wasn't dangerous it wouldn't be worth doing. The whole point is that its dangerous and therefore rarely done well.
</p>

<p>
	This works requires enormous nuance, care, and intelligence. These are structural meta-qualities which cannot ever be codified in the form of content. Which means, no matter how many times a teacher says to be nuanced, careful, and intelligent, it will not help someone who is sloppy, careless, and ignorant. You cannot make a person intelligent by telling them to be intelligent. If things were so easy we wouldn't be here struggling with consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The danger of the work is exactly what makes it so appealing. There are stakes. Much like life. Otherwise it would just be armchair philosophy with no transformative power. Changing your life comes at a cost. You might change it for the worse.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, set priorities and pace things out in stages. If you pace things well, then yes.
</p>

<p>
	You need to think 10 years ahead.
</p>

<p>
	But if you just randomly try to do multiple things at once you'll probably not get anywhere on either front.
</p>

<p>
	Mastering a career or art takes so much work, dedication, and attention that you need to have a clear, singular vision for what you're trying to achieve. Then hit it every day for 5-10 years relentlessly.
</p>

<p>
	This is discussed in detail in my Life Purpose Course.

<p>
	That's your mistake right there. Instead, open yourself to embracing it and loving it as one facet of what you are.
</p>

<p>
	The point of all this work is to transcend fear, replacing it with love.

<p>
	That and a hundred other things. Your entire sense of self, your entire psyche is involved. Everything your psyche fears, hates, denies, desires, and worries about it is involved.

	The details aren't really important. It's just the sum total of all your attachments and impurities as an ego-mind.

<p>
	No, because they are not phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness itself transcends all contents of consciousness in the way that a TV screen is permanent even though the content it displays is impermanent.

<p>
	The mistake you're making here is thinking of enlightenment/consciousness as phenomena. They are not. That's the whole point. If they were phenomena they would not be worth pursuing.

<p>
	1) The mind is always changing.
</p>

<p>
	2) The mind will be gone forever with death. It only seems permanent because you're judging it exclusively from inside itself, inside the context of your life. Your mind is treating your life as an absolute standard next to which everything else is judged and understood. But this is precisely backwards. You life could end in a split second at any moment and nothing of it will remain.

	Well, that Void is a classic advanced meditation state. Totally healthy and fine.

<p>
	Of course it will be shocking for anyone the first time they encounter it. The ego-mind will perceive it as death.

<p>
	It's not that big of deal for me. Just don't do it more than once a day, and take some days off in between. A couple times a week seems to work best.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, having sex actually takes a lot more time and energy.
</p>

<p>
	As with most things, a lot depends on how you do it and how you frame it in your mind. For me there is no negative vibe associated with it. You can do it in healthy ways to rejuvenate yourself.

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13355-dean-walker/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="13355" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/13355-dean-walker/" rel="">@Dean Walker</a> Figuring all that out is the bulk of your path. We can't tell you want you want and in which order you want it. You have to introspect to get clear about what your priorities should be for the next 5 years, let's say. Usually you want to focus on one key area of life like: business/career/life purpose, relationships/family, health/fitness, spirituality/meditation, education, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can't do it all at once. You gotta prioritize what you're most engaged in working on, what you most need to advance to the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	As an example, my first business stage lasted about 3 years, basically full-time. Then my relationship/dating stage lasted 1-2 years almost full-time. Then my next life purpose/business stage lasted 6 years, almost full-time. My fitness stage lasted a few years, part-time, sprinkled within the stages above.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, life is long and if you're young you've got plenty of time to pace yourself and plan stuff out in stages. 3 years invested into X, 5 years invested into Y, 2 years invested in Z.
</p>

<p>
	If you are starting a new biz, I would recommend planning to invest 5 years into it. At least 3 years. Anything less than that I just don't see how you'll succeed. 3 years is barely enough time for something like that.
</p>

<p>
	Not all things require equal time. Something like biz will be one of the most time-intensive things in your life if you want to succeed at it. Competition is fierce and there is a never-ending amount of work. Since biz is such a massive time investment it's wise to be very clear what values your want your business to represent.
</p>

<p>
	No, depends on how powerful your will is.
</p>

<p>
	If you're talking about altering physical reality in a way which affects others, your will needs to be equally powerful. These are not levels of access that the universe grants to most people, for obvious reasons, since there is enormous potential for devilry. Only the most spiritual advanced people might be given such access. Which is why you don't see people walking through brick walls every day. The whole point of "physical reality" is so that ordinary beings could not change it willy-nilly. You won't want people being able to walk through the walls of your house while you're jerking off in there.

<p>
	I am not well enough informed on this issue to give an opinion.
</p>

<p>
	Indian politics is not my jam. If you study the principles of Conscious Politics as I laid them out in my 4 part series and also Spiral Dynamics, that should allow you to make sense of most political issues by yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you also need accurate facts about the on-the-ground situation. Which I don't have in this case.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking I know that Modi is Blue and pushing a Blue cultural agenda. But India is so under-developed that I would be less critical of such things than I would in America. America should know better. India, not yet.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically, oppression of minorities and even genocide in India is par for the course. They are not collectively developed yet to transcend that. They must learn the hard way, by causing great harm to themselves and facing the ugliness of their selfish actions.

	UBI is a good idea, but it is only the beginning of other much needed reform. UBI by itself will not fix the fundamental corruption at the heart of the system. The systemic corruption is worse than anyone understands or knows how to fix. The corruption is at an existential level.

<title>Trip report: Is the object I hallucinate real in physical sense?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/43928-trip-report-is-the-object-i-hallucinate-real-in-physical-sense/?do=findComment&amp;comment=551475</link>

<p>
	Hehehe.... All "physical reality" is a hallucination held stable in the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	But that's still not the end of the mindfuck. The mind of God is nothing at all. So the fan doesn't really exist even when you stick your hand in it.
</p>

<p>
	It's all absolutely nothing. Nothing has ever happened. You imagine it did.
</p>

<p>
	All being is a direct manifestation of Will. As you become more conscious your will is able to materialize physical objects. But this is not the ego's will, it is the Will of Infinite Mind. As thr ego-mind unravels you become Infinite Mind, completely unlimited.
</p>

<p>
	If you became totally selfless you would have enough Will to materialize the entire physical universe in the blink of an eye. Well, you already are doing it, which is how it is here, but you're not conscious of how you're doing or even that you are doing it.
</p>

<p>
	When you trip you get a tiny, tiny taste of how Will generates physical reality, which is why the visual field starts to warp and the things you think start to spawn "hallucinations". If you think of a devil hard enough, one will materialize.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, AA is a bit dogmatic and stage Blue-ish. It's not designed for advanced people, and that's fine for what it is. But there is so much more.
</p>

<p>
	It's just a question of where you're at and how high you want to go.
</p>

<p>
	You must be willing to outgrow your peers, your support structures, and even your teachers. This is what makes advanced growth so challenging: you have to transcend all invented social support structures (since they don't go high enough).
</p>

<p>
	Once you climb to the end of the ladder mankind has built for you, you must chop down some trees and build new rungs yourself. Those who always expect the ladder to be built for them by others won't go very high.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bit odd that Yang argues that we are not yet ready for Medicare For Fall while pushing UBI. Right now we have a wider concensus for Medicare For All than UBI. At least 50% of the public is asking for Medicare For All. Not many are asking for UBI.

So he's grasping for an explanation of the Absolute but his cognition is too rigid and non-relativistic to do it. So he dances around a lot without ever hitting the nail on the head. Because he himself is confused about it. But he knows he's stumbled onto something important, which is why he's quite adamant about it. But he's adamant in the wrong direction.
</p>

<p>
	He's sorely missing a theoretical framework of nonduality and Anekantavada, trapped in his moralistic Christian upbringing.

	He thinks soviet Communists and college kids who support Bernie Sanders and trans rights are the same.

<p>
	Someone who has integrated Green would clearly see the difference between those two. This is a classic right-wing trap.

<title>The correct way to self-love?</title>

<p>
	You're not quite seeing how radical Self-Love is.
</p>

<p>
	ANYTHING you do, is Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	If you murder your family, that is Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is unlimited and you cannot ever fail it. Develop the courage to stop judging yourself, others, and reality. That's true Self-Love. Anything less would be ego. Which is also Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	How would you act if you knew you were loved under all choices and circumstances? THAT is liberation. Anything less is slavery.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I don't like psychoanalysis. I think it's more deluded than true. There are certainly some bits of truth in it, but also plenty of nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	There are much better resources. You don't want to end up like Slavoj Zizek: academically brilliant, but spiritually dumb as a rock.

Rather than trying to avoid bad trips, your intention should be to go into each trip and accomplish some shadow work. Confront those parts of yourself which you don't want to confront. Sort out your psyche. Slowly work through all your lies, fears, traumas, low self-esteem, grudges, etc. until your mind is pure. Then you will be ready for metaphysical contemplation.

<p>
	Remember, this is a long-term game we're playing.
</p>

<p>
	Slow and steady wins the race. Don't treat self-actualization as a 1 year activity. Treat it like a life-long activity which you have no choice but to do. This should put things into proper perspective.
</p>

<p>
	It's like going to church. People who go to church never think to themselves, "How soon until all this church attendance is done? 3 years? What if I attend three times as much per week? Can I finish it in 1 year?"
</p>

<p>
	No! You go to church for life.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	That's how this problem is solved. Not by sitting around on your ass.
</p>

<p>
	Approaching is very scary if you try to start doing it solo. You basically won't have the balls to do it unless you see a wingman doing it first.
</p>

<p>
	Solo approaching is one of the hardest things to do at first. Your mind will do everything possible to make sure you don't do the approach. It's psychological warfare with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But also solo approaching is where boys become men.
</p>

<p>
	Looks certainly play a big part, more than pundits admit because it renders their punditry useless.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that people vote for very stupid and simple reasons. Which is not good for serious candidates like Bernie.

<p>
	In truth, yes, that's a good insight. But they like to pretend like he is the most progressive candidate out there. For example they will tout how much he is ahead of Bernie.
</p>

<p>
	Of course what they don't realize is that they support Yang not for his policies but for his style and resonance with their Spiral level, which is roughly midway between Orange and Green.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a deep stage. There is a big difference between mild Green and deep Green.

			My point was that winning Wisconsin was not necessarily Trumps strength but the Democrats weakness. Of course there will always be some 3rd party voters, but Steins votes quintupled from 2012 to 2016, which means that Democrats did lose some of their voters to the Green Party and it was not just the regular Green Turnout.

<p>
	All of that is explained simply by Hilary being an uninspiring and unlikable candidate. She's just not a very likable person and her policies were bland.
</p>

<p>
	Many people vote simply based on personality, likability, and overall vibe. They are not doing any sophisticated analysis of anything. It's all by gut feel. Hilary's gut feel was bad. I voted for her, but I wasn't excited about it. I think this was the case for most people who voted for her. Trump had excited fools voting for him.

	That questions seems to lead to the I AM realization. Who you are is pure I AMness.

<p>
	But going even deeper, who you are is God, the one and only being. Then the question becomes, what is God? What is the "substance" of God, so to speak?

	It's foolish to believe that 3rd party votes could be eliminated and put into the Dem or Rep buckets. There will always be 3rd party votes, so learn to live it with it. They are always there in every election, so this argument that they should go to one or the other major candidate to reverse a loss is silly. Clinton knew Green party members wouldn't vote for her. She should have had enough margin not to need such desperate grasping at straws. She was simply an uninspiring candidate and that is why she lost.

<p>
	Because the religion of science has take over the entire domain of truth-seeking and defined itself as anti-mystical.

<p>
	You can't teach someone what reality is when he insists that reality is material.

<p>
	Science has sold its soul to the devil of pragmatism.

			This was really what I was talking about, I simply wasn't aware at the time that the body's accuracy was <em>that</em> good. Of course, if you eat tasty food you will get that immediate gratification, but if you listen very deeply you will be able to intuit whether it is actually life-promoting. And that even when the mind is naïve of harmful substances in the food!

	LSD is so freaking powerful you don't need audios to produce samadhi or enlightenment. Just sit and contemplate, "What is consciousness?" or a similar question. In fact, the videos and audios are distracting you from that. Don't consume media on psychedelics. That's like watching porn while you're having sex.

<p>
	Crank up your dose and you will have a full awakening. Just be careful what you wish for.

	Just because a thing isn't explicitly on a ban list doesn't mean they will treat you kindly if they catch you with it. That's not how the law works. The law is rarely clear, simple, or black and white.

<p>
	Which is just another example of nonduality. It's too hard for governments to make absolute distinctions because all distinctions are fluid and ever-evolving.

<p>
	It's silly hairsplitting.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is oneness. Nonduality is oneness.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness is an absolute which includes manyness within it. True Oneness does not create a division between oneness and manyness, nor does it preclude such a division from being made by those minds who wish to make it. In other words, relativity. If you look at the world looking for oneness, you will see it. If you look at the world looking for manyness, you will see it. Because your mind creates the world you see.

<p>
	Well, that's a deep topic. But to me the therapist needs to have a deep grasp of consciousness and trans-personal psychology. They need to know how to think outside the box, not just blindly conform to some cookie-cutter psychoanalytical ideology. They need a metaphysical grasp of the ego, and some degree of personal transcendence of ego.
</p>

<p>
	Without the above, the therapist is basically corrupt and deluded. It then becomes like the blind leading the blind.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if Jordan Peterson was your therapist. God help you.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, it all depends on what your goals are. I am biased towards profound goals with this work. If your goals are more modest, like fixing some minor relationship problem or weight problem, then you don't need such a deeply grounded therapist. Some hack will do.
</p>

<p>
	But if you're going to be doing psychedelics, you're gonna be more conscious than your therapist and your existential issues will be above the therapist's head. In this case the therapist will drag you down into her own delusional materialist "reality". For example, you might tell your therapist that death isn't real or that you are God, and she will tell you you're crazy. But really, she is projecting her own delusion onto you. Because in this case she is the crazy one pretending to be sane. She's just not conscious enough to understand psychological work at such deep levels.
</p>

	If you find a really good therapist it can work. The trick here is finding a really good one. And of course the $$$.
</p>

<p>
	You could also do this with a good life coach.

	Just read my words more carefully. It's important notice what I didn't say as much as noticing what I did say.

<p>
	The nature of dating advice is dealing with generalizations. Otherwise we couldn't even assume she doesn't have a dick. Dating involves a lot of assumptions. Many, many things must be assumed to succeed in attracting a woman. First and foremost it must be assumed she wants to sleep with you -- which is a rather bold assumption.

Odds-makers aren't doing any deep political analysis. They are just conforming to past results.

<p>
	Go back to 2015 and find the Vegas odds on Trump winning. Case in point.
</p>

<p>
	Steve Bannon himself laughed off the idea of Trump's reelection. Serious Republicans privately understand the deep hole Trump has put them all in. He is digging all their graves. They are playing violin on the deck of a sinking Titanic.
