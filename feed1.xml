		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It all depends. There are many possibilities:
</p>

<p>
	1) The guru is just an abusive asshole and a fake.
</p>

<p>
	2) The guru is somewhat awakened but still full of egoic impurities, not having finished his development and mastery.
</p>

<p>
	3) The guru genuinely believes he's helping his students. Maybe he is helping, maybe not. This can vary.
</p>

<p>
	4) The guru is genuinely helping his students but his students take it personally, have an ego-backlash, and project a lot of their own shit on the guru. In this case the guru is totally fine, but the student is just not capable of handling the teachings. The student is in over his head and lashes out at the guru.
</p>

<p>
	5) The accusations are exaggerated or entirely false. The student may misunderstand what the guru was doing.
</p>

<p>
	6) There may simply be a misalignment between the guru's style and the student's style. Which could easily be solved by finding a different guru without disparaging the old guru.
</p>

<p>
	All the above can happen. Rarely are things black and white. Rarely is a guru a total fake.
</p>

<p>
	No, the whole point is that it is NOT miserable. Your mind constructs pain, suffering, and misery.
</p>

<p>
	You are not understanding how deep this work goes.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine being so conscious that someone could break your finger and it would not be miserable to you.
</p>

<p>
	That is the depth of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Now, how to actualize that is the trick. It ain't easy. But we can work towards it.

<p>
	That's not quite true. Some teachers and gurus are genuinely abusive, ill-informed, or corrupt.
</p>

<p>
	You do have to pick your teachers carefully. The wrong teacher could seriously screw you up. But just having the right teacher is also not sufficient because there are so many ways you could screw up and mis-apply the teachings.
</p>

<p>
	It's wise to cross-reference teachers and teachings to make sure you cover all possible blindspots and biases.

<p>
	There's predicable pattern that happens with students. First they fall in love with the teachings. Then after a while they fall out of love because they need to differentiate themselves to grow and become their own Self.
</p>

<p>
	It's very much like a teen leaving the nest and rebelling against his parents in order to forge his own identity.
</p>

<p>
	"Fuck you Dad! You don't get to tell me what to do any more!"
</p>

<p>
	Okay, son. Go do what you gotta do.
</p>

<p>
	I told you from the beginning not to rely on me as your only source. But you didn't listen.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard for people to get that I am completely irrelevant in this work. None of this is about me. I do not matter. The one making this about me, is you. Because you deny our own authority you need some daddy figure to project it onto.
</p>

<p>
	That's only 1000 approaches. Not nearly enough to get good. After 1000 approaches you will still mostly suck, but maybe you'll have a few lucky hookups.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to get good you should be doing 20 approaches per night. And it will takes you 3-5 years.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, getting really good isn't necessary.

<p>
	A) He's not a puppet. He's a useful idiot for Putin to manipulate.
</p>

<p>
	B) Trump does a bad job at everything. So no one should expect him to be some kind of studious puppet. It's like throwing a squirrel into a tea ceremony. Doing a bad job is its job.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This is an absurd false equivalency. Obama has no business interests in Russia and Obama has high integrity. Trump's entire career hinged on Russian money and Trump as zero integrity. Trump would not refuse Russian help if it was offered. In fact, it was offered, and he and his son were eager to accept it.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	"Collusion" is a misleading word. The collusion wasn't necessarily one where Trump and Putin sat in a room and actively hatched a plan to win the election (although even that is within the realm of possibility with Trump). More likely it was simply a tacit understanding that this serves both their best interests. The way Mafia does business is mostly tacitly. The boss doesn't need to tell his staff to kill someone or bring him money. Everyone understands what the game is. So no explicit collusion is necessary. In fact it's best to avoid it to reduce chances of being caught. That's how business is done at Stage Red. You're not going to find a paper trail.

			Racism is a tricky thing, and not really that straightforward IMO. It’s possible to be racist in some contexts and not in others. It’s why people can have friends of other races and then go home and complain about “other races ruining their country.” In this instance they see their friends as human and close relationships, but then see broad ethnic groups as just a vague idea that’s somehow bad for their civilisation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Its like how there’s a lot of Hispanic Trump voters who want a wall to keep Hispanic migrants out. They themselves might look like and even be related to these migrants, but due to a number of different cultural factors they end up identifying with the dominate, ethno-cultural group they inhabit (and some of the racist ideas this group holds.)
		</p>

		<p>
			So as for Stella’s father, I’d say it’s possible for him to both marry a Puerto Rican woman and hold discriminatory views against Native Americans. The contexts around each relationship are different, and it’s these relationships that her father’s ego can accept or not accept (marrying someone from a Hispanic US territory vs having his daughter date someone from a discriminated minority that also has a lot of social ills within its own community.)
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This!
</p>

<p>
	Marrying a Puerto Rican woman don't mean shit.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is clever enough to compartmentalize and make such justifications as part of its self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	"Look, I can't be a heartless rich person because I donate money to the poor once a year." Lol. The mind is masterful at such bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	A slave-owner might genuinely tell himself, "How can I be a racist when I have sex with my slaves? And I treat them so well!"
</p>

<p>
	The mind will never accept the label "racist" because it's far too ugly to admit that. So denial all the way to the grave.
</p>

			Ok, so because of this, you're saying the Russians wanted him so that he can do their bidding? And if so, how did they know or plan to get this reality talk show host to beat every Republican in the 2016 primary and know he would face off against Hillary Clinton all those years ago? And if they did know this and achieved it, why hasn't Trump done their bidding this entire time while he was in office?

<p>
	The Russians are just manipulators, exploiters, and opportunists. Of course they couldn't know Trump would win. They got a very lucky break.  But now that they got it, they will use it to their utmost.
</p>

<p>
	Trump HAS been extremely accomodating to Putin.
</p>

<p>
	Hillary was an existential threat to Putin. She would have plotted to undermine and overthrow him.

	Not really, because most people create unconsciously, so it's a stretch to say they "wanted" it. It was more like a default result that they never even thought about until after they got it.

<p>
	My best guess is that Russians got blackmail material on Trump and they backed many of his loans overseas. It's well known that Russians bankrolled Trump's entire business for decades. No one in the US gave him loans. Russians used Trump to launder money. That was Trump's entire lifeblood, selling stupidly overprices condos to Russian oligarchs and their friends.
</p>

<p>
	It wasn't proven because 1) Mueller's investigation was very limited. He did not look into Trump's finances or his past. Only the most recent activity, and 2) Trump and his goons obstructed what little investigation there was and destroyed evidence and documents.
</p>

<p>
	The Clintons are nowhere near as corrupt as Trump. And also it's a moot point since neither of them is President.
</p>

<p>
	No other President we've had comes close to Trump's level of corruption. Trump is in a class by himself.
</p>

<p>
	Change doesn't happen for much more profound reasons: because people aren't conscious enough to want it or handle it.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you have more than two parties doesn't automatically guarantee that good stuff will happen without resistance.
</p>

	There is no such clear line. Both happen. Evolution is both gradual and sudden.

	It all depends on the details of the situation. There's no simple rule for what is best.

<p>
	There will be less negative side effects from TYT than Jimmy Dore.
</p>

<p>
	Jimmy Dore is wrong on Russia. There is definitely a Trump-Russia connection, it's just not clear what that connection is. It's probably worse than anyone imagines. Maybe one day we will know. And maybe not, because not all things can be proven.

<p>
	Never give Trump the benefit of the doubt on such things. He's rotten to the core.
</p>

<p>
	Regardless, Jimmy Dore's whole style is dogmatic and will lead to problems if it is more widely adopted. Politics requires much more nuance. This is not conscious politics, it's foaming-at-the-mouth progressivism, which is no virtue.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's basically correct based on my current understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment cannot ultimately be permanent because otherwise you could not be born. Enlightenment had to be lost for you to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness oscilates between awake and asleep.
</p>

<p>
	However! Enlightenment is not limited to an incarnation. I've had total infinite consciousness where I became all things while still in my Leo incarnation. The two are not mutually exclusive.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening can cut through all things.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to distinguish desire of the soul vs desire of the ego.
</p>

<p>
	LoA works best when one is clear about this distinction and pursuing the cravings of the soul. Your soul only craves one thing: Love and reunion.

	That MLM stuff is a total bastardization of LoA.
</p>

<p>
	LoA does not mean that you will get what you want via a parasitic pyramid scheme. LoA requries being flexible about how things come to you. You have to be willing to drop the MLM to actualize your dreams.

	No, that's not what I said. I said you will live through all beings who haved lived. Hitler is someone who lived. And he is you. So you will experience being him. But this does not mean that you will experience some random variation of that where Hitler was born a midget.

<p>
	Ultimately you won't be able to do Self-Love without some deep awakenings and a transformation of your baseline state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You must do practices like Kriya yoga to purify your body and mind. Thinking about love is not gonna cut it.

	Do not look for definitions or theories. Do not create anything. Observe your judgments directly. Observe patiently. This is the way.

<p>
	It is precisely how it feels. Nothing more, nothing less.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to locate it in 3D space. Rather just feel it exactly as it feels. That's it. It's going to feel amorphous, vague, and mysterious. Keep your awareness right on top of that. Don't try to turn it into something concrete or visual. Pain is not visual. Its vagueness is part of what it is.

<title>Self-Love: Leo's take on Self-Esteem vs Nathaniel Brandon's</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/42935-self-love-leos-take-on-self-esteem-vs-nathaniel-brandons/?do=findComment&amp;comment=537220</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Self-Love is a very high-level abstraction. Brandon's self-esteem is more mundane and nitty-gritty because you cannot just tell people "self-love" and expect them to grow from that. They wouldn't know how to actualize it.
</p>

<p>
	Also, Brandon never realize how deep self-esteem goes because he never had the necessary mystical experiences to access Self or Love. So his work cannot take you to the highest God level. But it's still great for ordinary people who aren't advanced enough yet to reach God level.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that his work hinges on rasing one's awareness. AKA raising consciousness. But he never tells you what consciousness is. It's LOVE!
</p>

<p>
	If you're reading for depth -- which you should be -- nothing beats a paperback.
</p>

<p>
	But audios are good for when you're multitasking.
</p>

<p>
	And some of the most important books are not available in audio at all. Would be a shame to miss those out of laziness.

<p>
	Human morality is guided by a tiny connection to Absolute Goodness, which is then corrupted and hijacked by the ego-mind to further its survival.
</p>

<p>
	If Absolute Goodness is the sun, human morality is like a moth flying in circles around a candle flame.

<p>
	That's my point. You're not appreciating how pervasive survival is. Survival is always needed (if you care to survive, and you certainly do, otherwise you wouldn't care about being in a commune to begin with).
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be any kind of stabled formed experience without survival.
</p>

<p>
	Survival needs are what make a commune less than utopian.
</p>

<p>
	You can certainly find some decent high-consciousness communes, but they will still have many common social problems. Or even worse, they could be toxic cults behind the scenes.

<p>
	Guess again.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to escape social survival that easily.
</p>

<p>
	You already live in a commune. It's called society. It is messy and dirty precisely because that's what social survival looks like. Survival is a dirty business and not even awakened people are above it, assuming they care to survive.
</p>

<p>
	Any social arrangement is gonna get complicated very quickly. You have to be willing to play that game. If not, go live in a cabin in the woods, or just an apartment.
</p>

<p>
	The closest thing to utopia will be a cabin in the woods, far away from people. Assuming you are conscious enough to handle that.

It comes directly from the source itself, it is an expression of all possible dualites. It is Pure, and it is there. It is just as much a fascet of existence as Blueness is, and it is just as Absolute as Blueness is. It is not relative as much as Blue is not relative.

<p>
	Well sure, you're talking about absolute being now. This is very different from what people normally mean when they talk about morality and something being bad or wrong.

<title>Is it conscious politics to hold devils accountable?</title>

	Dude, if TYT is not progressive enough for you, you're shit out of luck in this life.
</p>

<p>
	Few people speak out against corruption as much as TYT.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you fight corruption doesn't mean you have to be a rabid dog about it. You can still be polite and respectful. Society has certain norms and standards which are wise to observe simply from a practical point.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you have a gripe with Albright doesn't mean everyone else must too.
</p>

<p>
	There are lots of ways to hold devils accountable. Don't expect people to do it your way. They will do their own way. If you want things done your way, you do it. Go interview Albright and call her a devil to her face. Let's see how far you get.
</p>

<p>
	That's precisely wrong. Right and wrong are FAR more socially constructed than anger or blueness. Which is obvious if you notice that no two humans agree on what is right and wrong, good or bad.
</p>

<p>
	To realize the relativity of good & bad does not even require awakening. It's a lot more obvious than that. A child can understand it using a bit of logic.

<p>
	The brain is part of your mind. Mind interacts with mind.
</p>

<p>
	With deep awakening, you will realize that your mind was never happening in the brain, your brain was happening in your mind. And then the brain part of your mind will simply shut off, like it never existed. Then you will be free of the illusion of physicality. You will become non-physical and immortal.

<p>
	I am very sensitive too. This is a huge plus. Saves you on wasted chems and takes your trips deeper.
</p>

<p>
	There is really no point talking about it. Do 100 trips and see what happens. A few trips is nothing. Contemplate in your trips. Don't get lost in chasing forms but rather focus on nondual insight and purification.

From the relative perspective there would be consequences you'd have to deal with.
</p>

<p>
	Your actions have natural consequences. So long as you accept those, nothing is wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but what's wrong with not telling the truth? That's a freedom you have. Tricking people is part of how life keeps on living.
</p>

<p>
	There exists no one in reality who can determine whether lying is wrong, other than you. So if you believe it is wrong, it is wrong, for you, because you imagine it to be so. But don't expect others to necessarily agree.

<title>Light Rays and Materialism</title>

<p>
	Video games use "light rays" too. Does that make them real? Does that mean light rays cause Mario's face to light up? Does that mean Mario exists outside the video game world?
</p>

<p>
	Your questions are being asked from within the Matrix, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
	What way would life have to be designed for you to say, "This life isn't real."?
</p>

<p>
	Can't you see that no matter how it was designed, since you have nothing else to compare it to, it can't seem anything but real for you.
</p>

<p>
	Consider this: if you were Mickey Mouse in a cartoon world, and you'd never experienced anything but that world, you'd think that it is real. You'd have no choice. It would be your baseline for everything. And what's more, if you ever got a glimpse of human life you'd say, "That's so unreal! Those humans are so limited."

<p>
	The point is, right and wrong are relative notions.
</p>

<p>
	There is no absolute right and wrong. But in the relative world -- relative to living a decent human life -- you should not kill people, because it will not end well for you. But again, this is all relative. If you want things to go badly for you as a human, by all means, go for it. You will either end up in jail or killed by the police. Maybe if you're extremely lucky you can get away with it, OJ style. But even then, you'll still live a miserable life. Don't forget, OJ still served 10 years in prison thanks to his criminality.
</p>

<p>
	This is where Understanding Relativism comes in. Watch that video and contemplate it deeply until you understand what relativity means.

<p>
	Blue Beings and whatnot do not contradict Self-Love, and since any kind of being is a form, it is still a subtle form of duality.
</p>

<p>
	I didn't say things "stop" at Self-Love. Self-Love is infinite. It's all that is. You can keep exploring the world of form forever. No matter what new forms you discover, it will all just be facets of your Self.
</p>

<p>
	So there's no real contradiction here. Just people talking about different facets and forms in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	There may be all sorts of beings in the universe. So what? None of it threatens or undermines nonduality.
</p>

			And at this point I am not sure if it was my mind playing games on me but basically what happened was I was shown “nothing”. And as I started to go there / allowing the experience of nothingness, a thought came up basically saying that if I chose to experience nothingness it would mean that I could never return. Because from nothingness, there is no way back. There is no way, no ego, no universe, no awareness, not even unawareness. Just nothing.
		</p>

		<p>
			So in that moment I convinced myself that if I decided to experience nothingness, the universe would just sort of collapse and everything would cease to exist. Obviously that sounds funny right now but that’s what it felt like in that moment.
		</p>

		<p>
			Later during the trip, I noticed that maybe two seemingly opposing truths can exist at the same time and that there is no way to grasp that using a “three dimensional” or linear way of thinking about it.
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe there are certain levels of truths.
		</p>

		<p>
			It appeared to me that yes, maybe “I am everything.” is an objective truth but that “I am.” is an even deeper truth. And therefore nothingness and “something” can happen without excluding the other.
		</p>

		<p>
			It also made me think about quantum mechanics (and I do not know a lot about this topic), that prior to being observed, a quantum system is not in any particular state. It’s in a superposition state that contains all the possible states at once. So first, it just “is”. Then it “is something” (when being observed).
		</p>

<p>
	Yes, this is precisely correct.
</p>

<p>
	Although there is an even deeper level where you realize that something and nothing are identical and there is nowhere else to go. You can't choose to experience Nothing because you're already experiencing Nothing all the time regardless of whatever you're experiencing or not-experiencing.
</p>

<p>
	That Nothing you encountered was The Void, The Godhead, Mu, or your Original Face as the Zen folks call it.
</p>

<p>
	There are of course much deeper levels of nonduality and more facets you can access with practice.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful taking such large doses and mixing substances. Lower your dose to 125ug of LSD and learn to contemplate.
</p>

			So what I'm gathering from everybody here is that my thoughts took control and led the trip into a spiral, i.e. I felt resistance and I thought fear, so my mind conjured up fearful images and thoughts that altered the course of the trip. Because at the start of it, I felt a little overwhelmed, but I wasn't necessarily in fear, just in awe of discovering what was a massive truth of reality that I had not yet experienced, and it slowly changed into a lot more morbid visions. Is this a good indication that there's a lot of shadow work that I need to do, that perhaps there are much underlying, deeply subconscious thoughts that I've not come to face until now? Or is it that I've not yet gotten to a point where I'm able to let go of my ego in order to objectively experience a trip? 
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	It wasn't even fear per se. Your mind just happened to drift off into images of blood and you did nothing to change it so it just got stuck in an echochamber of bloodly imagery. Then you got scared because what you imagined started to materialize before you and you were confused about how this was possible. You were terrified by the power of your own imagination and it didn't even occur to you to control it.
</p>

<p>
	This is all normal. You must learn that your imagination is very powerful, so be careful how you use it, or how you let it use you.
</p>

<p>
	You can avoid such trippy detours by giving your trips a strong intention. Guide your mind towards what you wish you contemplate so your trip isn't just a random dream.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to not get lost in the content of one's trips but rather to focua on going meta, contemplating the strucuture of consciousness. What I have been describing here is strucuture while your bloody stuff was content.
</p>

<p>
	Self-Love is an end in itself, and that is why it can keep people in line.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to reform a criminal is through Love, not hate. And the criminal must learn to love himself.
</p>

<p>
	When you love the world, do you need to be kept in line? Nope

<title>Self Love and The Practicality of It</title>

<p>
	Yes, practical teachings are still important. It's not enough to literally only have one teaching. The devil is in the details. People need help with implementation of high-level abstractions like Self-Love.

	To be fair, 5-MeO-DMT has a fairly high bodyload and can also cause nausea. A few times I came close to vomiting but what saved me was having a totally empty stomach.
</p>

<p>
	If you have even a bit of food in your stomach you will vomit it up on a deep trip.
</p>

<p>
	Of course we have backups, which is why the data loss would not be total. Otherwise the entire forum could be lost.
</p>

<p>
	Creating frequent forum backups wastes a lot of server resources.
