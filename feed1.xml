You can't really go wrong with that advice.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, never follow advice too literally. You must apply it with intelligence and contextual awareness.

	I shot a video but I was having some sinus troubles so it didn't come out to my liking and it will be re-shot, as it's an important new topic.
</p>

<p>
	I usually try to get a video ready by Sunday, but if I'm unhappy with how it turned out, I would rather re-shoot it than to release something just to maintain an artificial schedule.

Every trip is a stand-alone experience and you have no idea what future trips will entail. They will not unfold as you expect.

	He is talking about the difference between seeing the Ox and taming the Ox.
</p>

<p>
	But even aside from all of that, there is still another dimension: development.
</p>

<p>
	Full enlightenment does not guarantee development.

	That's like going to bench press 500 lbs, failing, and then saying, "I don't think I will exercise ever again in my life. Exercise is dangerous and nasty."
</p>

<p>
	No, it's just that you did it foolishly.
</p>

<p>
	See how the ego tricked you?
</p>

<p>
	The proper way would have been to take 20 1-tab trips spaced out over the course of 2 years. Then you would have seen growth. But instead you let your ego trick you.

<p>
	The surprising thing would be if they didn't exist in religious groups, since they are part of everywhere.

<p>
	The key is to really know your subject matter.
</p>

<p>
	So in fact there is lots of prep, but that prep is years of research behind the scenes until you know the topic like the back of your hand.

They will be working on and enjoying their results.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be successful you need a serious business and marketing strategy. Dicking around on YT or a forum is not gonna cut it.
</p>

<p>
	You need to get very serious about your work. Stop dicking around and go create something that offers massive value to the world, and do it smartly. Passion is no substitute for poor business strategy.

<p>
	3 years is more than enough to time to learn that you don't like something. Clearly you ain't passionate about that.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to eat shit for a long time to know you're passionate about some subject.
</p>

<p>
	What do you enjoy studying? What kind of projects excite you?

<p>
	Formless Tao is unchanging.
</p>

<p>
	Formed Tao is ever-changing.
</p>

<p>
	Formless Tao and Formed Tao are identical. But they can also be distinguished.
</p>

<p>
	Again, changing vs unchanging is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Tao vs non-Tao is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Mundane vs True Tao is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Tao is ALL.
</p>

<p>
	Just...
</p>

<p>
	Tao

</p>

<p>
	It sounds like you just need to do a lot more contemplation, meditation, yoga, self-inquiry, and basic development work. LSD is a catalyst for all that.
</p>

<p>
	Pouring fuel on a fire only works if there is already a fire.

You gotta keep in mind that the stuff you learn from me is extremely advanced stuff that takes years and decades to put in place. I share a very big picture of your potential, the downside of which is that it can seem impossible to achieve, so far away.
</p>

<p>
	This is sort of the curse of a lofty vision.
</p>

<p>
	Baby steps man. You are still super young and your whole life is ahead of you. You have plenty of time to create a great life.
</p>

<p>
	Focus now on building a vision and cultivating hope. You want to enjoy the process of assembling your life. It's fun. Don't make it a grind.

</p>

<p>
	Don't worry, this is just the first step. You don't need to resolve all your answers and get breakthroughs in 1 or 2 trips. You should have the attitude that you will trip 20+ times and in that time you will figure a lot of stuff out and have many breakthroughs.
</p>

<p>
	Try to avoid distracting yourself in future trips. Stay away from electronics and note-taking devices. Allow yourself to go fully into the trip. Stop anchoring yourself to your old reality.
</p>

<p>
	Do not place a bunch of goals and expectations on a trip. Your #1 goal when tripping should be to go wherever the trip takes you. Drop all expectations or needing it to show you certain things. Deep insights will come organically. Just relax, surrender, and be ready to explore. Metaphysical curiosity is all you really need.
</p>

<p>
	When you trip, try not to move around so much. Sit still with eyes open, upright, fully alert -- like a meditation retreat.
</p>

<p>
	No, I don't consider infinite intelligence the Akashic Records. Akashic Records are supposed to be a database of the universe's entire history. Infinite intelligence is devoid of content. It is pure and formless. You will not find any historical memories or events in it.
</p>

<p>
	High doses of psychedelics are probably good for accessing the Records. I have yet to verify that.
</p>

<p>
	Or it might require some psychic talent. I'm not very psychic.

How to you want your music to affect others? Therein lies the selfless part.

	Personally I have not accessed them. Yet. Then again, I haven't really tried. My focus has been going into other things.

	I'm still researching the best books on this issue.

	I agree he shares some good wisdom and insights. Many cult leaders share valuable insights.

<p>

Cults are often a mixture of both. It's a common mistake to assume that cults offer no valid spiritual insight. The issue is, spiritual insights via a video or book do not guarantee that the cult isn't a shit-show behind the scenes.
</p>

<p>
	Case in point: Osho's commune. Osho was a good teacher but a terrible community leader.
</p>

<p>
	Saying advanced stuff into a camera is very easy compared to running a high consciousness community. Narcissistic cult leaders are often exceptionally good at speaking, bullshitting, and putting up fake fronts. That is their Zone of Genius. So you can't take appearances too seriously. Look at their actions rather than their words.
</p>

<p>
	If the community leader is taking on multiple wives or asking for six figure donations or has a criminal history -- that's a HUGE red flag.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is a set of special physical and energetic techniques for rewiring your nervous system. It is supposed to be much more powerful than meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Kriya yoga is a bit like micro-dosing psychedelics.

Engineering work is usually pretty dry and routine.
</p>

<p>
	That's the major reason I switched my major from engineering to philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	Try looking at more artist careers like creative writing, design, film-making, fine art, etc. That's where you can really flex your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I love the imaginative nature of game design or storytelling.

<p>
	In practice it's hard to help the world when you are underdeveloped and struggling to meet your basic needs.
</p>

<p>
	The point of developing yourself is so that you can become a better tool for helping uplift the world.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't wait to be perfect before you help the world. You can work on both simultaneously. Help out in whichever ways you're able. Don't bite off more than you can chew.
</p>

<p>
	The greatest thing you will ever do for the world is to awaken yourself.

<p>
	That isn't the issue. The issue is, are you capable enough, resourceful enough, to solve the problem of feeding yourself? The food itself is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	If you struggle to feed yourself that is a serious red flag. It shows a lack of development, resourcefulness, discipline, and self-efficacy.

<p>
	Very common.
</p>

<p>
	Do not trust young spiritual leaders to run solid communities. Running a spiritual community requires enormous development, ethics, experience, wisdom, and maturity. Spiritual communities quickly devolve into sex cults if the leader isn't masterful in his self-control, ethics, and emotions.
</p>

<p>
	You can almost guarantee that spiritual communities lead by 20-30 year olds will devolve very quickly. They have no idea the challenges.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment alone is nowhere near enough to run successful spiritual community.

Failure is part of the learning process.
</p>

<p>
	Now you have a bit of a better sense of how difficult it is to pull off a solid meditation retreat. Especially solo. Its takes super-human levels of self-discipline and dedication.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you have to build up to it. Just like you cannot will yourself to bench press 300 lbs. It takes many months of ramping up to that.
</p>

<p>
	The value of something like Kriya yoga is that you can do it for 1hr per day and it will gradually strengthen you over the course of a year in a way which you would never be able to achieve with a week-long hardcore retreat. The reality is that it takes time to rewire the mind and build tolerance for meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you need a lot more daily practice. It also helps a lot to hit a point in your practice where you actually enjoy meditation. It's very hard to pull off a retreat if you're secretly hoping it stops. The key is to surrender to the whole process and try to enjoy the silence, solitude, and peace. But that probably won't happen your first few retreats.
</p>

<p>
	Just keep practicing and doing as much as you can. Remember, it's not all about quantity. The quality of your practice is far more important than quantity. Quantity without quality will not yield much results.
</p>

<p>
	Also be patient. You are young. You don't need to be enlightened tomorrow. It's okay if it takes 5 years of practice. You will still be ahead of everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Precisely because you want to.

<p>
	Stop holding life purpose as something that NEEDS to be done. It's not about need, it's about desire to play a game.
</p>

<p>
	There's no need for Mario run across the screen and avoid turtle shells. But if you WANT, it can be a fun game. No one is forcing you to play Mario. If you would rather sit in your mother's basement and stare at the wall, go right ahead.

<p>
	There is no such thing as "a reality". Reality is entangled with one's nervous system. Such that every living creature has a different reality. If there is an infinite number of possible ways to configure a nervous system, there are an infinite number of different realities. For example, in some realities the color red does not exist because of how the nervous system is structured. In other realities it is not possible to know that 5+5=10 because of how the nervous system is structured. For example, a donkey cannot realize that 5+5=10. It cannot have that insight. But a human can. And not all humans. Only those with a proper nervous system. A mentally disabled person cannot realize that 5+5=10.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine all the experiences and insights you are unable to have simply because your nervous system does not grant you access to them. Your nervous system is like a filter through which infinity is boiled down to a narrow limited finite set of experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics alter your nervous system, allowing you to access experiences and insights that would otherwise be impossible. Which is why they're so uniquely useful for metaphysical work.
</p>

<p>
	But independent of all the above, there is the Absolute Truth, which you have access to if you are normal healthy human being.
</p>

<p>
	That's better than nothing. Nothing wrong with those. You can strategically use that motivation to build a lot of necessary infrastructure in your life. Then you can move on to higher things.
</p>

<p>
	Do not feel bad about meeting lower survival needs. They are necessary in most cases. You've got to climb Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. If the higher needs don't motivate you just yet that's probably because you're so under-developed in the lower ones.
</p>

<p>
	If you are in your early 20's you need to focus on learning basic survival skills. Learn how to feed yourself independently. Then worry about spirituality. If you are incapable of feeding yourself, you have no hope of attaining enlightenment or other advanced stuff like that.
</p>

<p>
	It is what it is. Work on developing yourself. It doesn't matter what is happening around you really.
</p>

<p>
	Take extreme ownership of your development. Stop expecting other people or your community to build you a staircase to heaven. Build your own staircase.
</p>

<p>
	With all the books, videos, and resources available so easily today via the internet you have no excuse not to be at Turquoise. If you don't achieve it it's only due to one reason: you're being lazy and irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
	You already have all the information. Why aren't you taking action? Why aren't you building a million dollar business? Why aren't you meditating 3 hours per day? Why aren't you working on your life purpose? Why aren't you developing powerful relationships? Why aren't you eating healthy? Why aren't you doing yoga? Why aren't you doing solo retreats?
</p>

<p>
	Laziness
</p>

<p>
	There is no cure for laziness but to get to work.

			I've decided that I want to transcend some of my blue values to orange. For example, I value the following:

			-Law and Order
		</p>

		<p>
			-Good manners and decency
		</p>

<p>
	Well, you could sit down, contemplate what those things are and realize they all fabrications of your mind.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is justice?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is law?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is order?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is good manners?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is the afterlife?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Don't you find it odd that you value these things so highly yet you've never really wondered what they are or where they came from? Or if they're even real?
</p>

<p>
	How can you truly value these things if you don't know what they are?
</p>

<p>
	A big part of transcending Blue is starting to think critically for yourself and question everything that your culture taught you. Become skeptical of everything. Every belief must be questioned to death.

<p>
	Yes, it's very valuable.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't become a devotee of any one teacher. Every teacher and teaching has blindspots.
</p>

<p>
	You must be capable of exploring a wide variety of perspectives and teachings or you will get trapped.

<p>
	More trips are required to answer the questions this trip of yours raised.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, mushroom trips can be quite twisted and difficult to make sense of. Other psychedelics like LSD or 5-MeO-DMT are clearer.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to escape thought loops is to change your state or physical location. Just going into a different room can be enough to break out of a bad thought loop, or going outside, or eating a snack, or turning on some silly music and dancing around for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta learn to shift your state. Meditation is also very helpful. If you're good at meditation you should be able to just silence the mind and its thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	And when all else fails: just SURRENDER

<p>
	Self-inquiry is supposed to be a struggle. Of course you are doubtful and confused. That cannot be helped. The only thing that can ultimately clear up the confusion is awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You must do the inquiry and struggle through all the doubts and emotional issues which will inevitably arise.
</p>

<p>
	Awareness/emptiness isn't really felt, it is awared. We use the word "feeling" colloquially. Strictly speaking it is not a feeling. But feeling is much closer than thinking or imagining.

</p>

<p>
	Awareness is nothing. Nothing is not inner. It is omnipresent. It feels like its inner because that's what ego has done with it: appropriated it to construct a sense of self.
</p>

<p>
	As you do self inquiry that sense of emptiness will stop feeling like it is inside the head/body. It will spill out into the world.

Making a lot more practical than LSD or others. You don't need to be in a retreat setting. Just a comfortable undisturbed setting for 60 mins.

<p>
	Yes, that is prrcisely what awakening and spirituality is about: seeing through all illusions as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	At first your ability to see through illusions is weak. With practice it becomes so strong that you finally see through the illusion of death, time, space, and physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, everything is an illusion.

			Life Purpose is about driving yourself to make an impact in the world. But this can only work if you are stuck in the illusion of control. In reality, you have no control whatsoever. As soon as you realise this (Enlightenment), driving yourself is no longer a possibility. As soon as you become aware of non-doership, you can no longer drive yourself to do anything, because you have no control over anything at all.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Why are you making such groundless assumptions??
</p>

<p>
	Since there was no one in control to begin with, that means nothing is lost with enlightenment. No-control is not opposed to drive. Drive is done by the universe, not by the ego. The ego is just an offshoot of universal drive.
</p>

<p>
	After enlightenment your life purpose becomes a force of the universe -- just like it always was. Nothing changed. Only some egoic delusions of control were removed.
</p>

<p>
	You assume that life purpose is an egoic thing, but it does not have to be.

Your technique or dosage may just be off.

<p>
	B) HCl can be smoked too.

<p>
	C) HCl can be converted to freebase pretty easily from what folks say.

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is not a substance you want to give up on easily. Find a way to make it work. It will be worth it.

You will just require an above average dose.
</p>

<p>
	Throwing up is solved by taking it on a completely empty stomach.
</p>

<p>
	If snorting and plugging don't do it for ya, then smoking certainly should. But you'll have to learn how to properly vaporize it and lower your doses a lot.
</p>

<p>
	You have to experiment to find what your mild, medium, high, and breakthrough dosages are. 4 trials is really not enough in your case.
</p>

<p>
	It would help a lot if you had done other psychedelics and knew your overall tolerance level to stuff like LSD and mushrooms.

<p>
	There is no difference between the screen and all the stuff on the screen.
</p>

<p>
	You can differentiate them if you want but they are simultaneously one.
</p>

<p>
	If you are seeing the screen as one thing and the stuff on the screen as another thing, that is a duality. So just realize they are one.

	No statement can ever be absolutely true. All statements are dualistic and at best relatively and partially true.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth is not a statement or an idea. It is what is actual. The entire actual universe and much more!
</p>

<p>
	Some aspects of solipsism point at one or two facets of the Absolute Truth, but Absolute Truth is way more grand and radical than solipsism would have you believe.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is a much better term than solipsism.
</p>

<p>
	But it is true that you are the only thing that exists. But NOT in the way you imagine.
</p>

<title>Why not 'evil' things?</title>

With enlightenment these are seen through so there is much less need to do evil.
</p>

<p>
	good and evil are transcended into Good with a capital G. Without ego, everything becomes Good, not neutral as you might expect.
</p>

<p>
	Good and evil are not really equal and opposite. In truth there is no such thing as evil, leaving only Good.

<title>Self-Inquiry - Additional tips to find the real emptiness?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/29432-self-inquiry-additional-tips-to-find-the-real-emptiness/?do=findComment&amp;comment=340464</link>

<p>
	Yeah, this is the whole trick with self-inquiry: the mind refuses to stay with the emptiness because it needs some image to grasp.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you wrote is the noise of the mind. Look past all that towards the emptiness and just try to observe it without worry or mind noise. This takes lots of practice, focus, and patience.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this is Neti Neti. The emptiness cannot be found in the conventional sense of finding a physical object. Something radically new must click.
</p>

<p>
	What are you beneath all that mind noise and doubt? What is observing the noise? Stay on that with steadiness. Try to keep the mind very calm. You want to hit a silent observer state. Observe observation itself.
</p>

<p>
	You are observation itself. But what is observation?? Don't think the answer -- observe!
</p>

<p>
	You will definitely fall into the trap of intellectualizing emptiness over and over again thousands of times before you learn not to do that.
</p>

<p>
	Remember this is like a live scientific experiment. You are working in the labrabory of your own mind.
</p>

Those are relative.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to fit reality into a cause and effect paradigm is a big obstacle to spiritual understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is nonlinear.

Everything is 100% relative to the structure of one's nervous system, including the nervous system itself!
</p>

<p>
	Your nervous system restricts your access to what would otherwise be an infinite number of possible "realities" and insights.

You have to be willing to take that plunge into the unknown, ready to surrender everything, including everyone you love.

<p>
	You ain't gonna get it without hardcore spiritual practice or psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Go do a psychedelic retreat. Then you will get it. Because right now you ain't got anywhere close to Truth. You are lost inside a hallucination with no idea of how to escape.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are no joke. They are a crucial tool in the journey for ordinary people. The average person will NEVER grasp the depth of this work without psychedelics. Even people who meditate will still miss the depth of this work.
</p>

<p>
	It is worth your time and effort to do a retreat. Stop being lazy.

<p>
	Eliminate all wheat, rice, potatoes, and refined sugar from your diet and you'll lose weight easily.
</p>

<p>
	Also reduce your meal portion size by 20%-30%. You want to leave the dinner table with a slight feeling of emptiness in your stomach. Never stuff yourself full.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to starve. You can still eat delicious high energy foods like meat, oil, butter, and fat.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make this a diet. Make this a permanent change to how you eat food from now on.
