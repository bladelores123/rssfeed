	I did not assume you were.
</p>

<p>
	I am merely communicating to you guys that you are lazy. You do not really care about truth. You are here dicking around.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is a serious pursuit and it's clear simply by one's attitude who is serious about it and who is not.
</p>

<p>
	This is extremely advanced work we are doing, yet many of you treat it so sloppily. As if this is some CNN debate panel where one can just spew bullshit and opinions with impungity.
</p>

<p>
	You want to understand psychics? Go read 20 books written by psychics. Then let's talk. Show me you're serious.

			It's funny how each time someone says that science has often tested these so called paranormal phenomena and always found a rational explanation, defenders of the paranormal start to attack science as a whole, saying how the experiment was biased and flawed.

<p>
	No, you have it precisely backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Serious statistical studies have been conducted many times on paranormal phenomena by serious researchers, and the result is always the same: paranormal phenomena is proven beyond any reasonable doubt.
</p>

<p>
	But you have not read these studies because they are rejected by gatekeepers of academia because in their paradigm the paranormal is impossible so all research which proves it must be false.
</p>

<p>
	Science itself has proven the paranormal. This fact is simply denied and not advertized to you, so you don't know about it.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is that you speak surely of things you have not actually researched nor contemplated nor experienced. You are just spreading dogma without knowing what you are doing. You feel so certain, but you are actually wrong and you are too lazy and incurious to check that you are wrong.
</p>

<p>
	So here we are.

<p>
	The epistemic issues of science go far deeper than materialism.

	If only you knew how deeply I contemplated the nature of science.
</p>

<p>
	When I finish explaining science, your jaw will drop. Be patient.

<p>
	That's difficult.
</p>

<p>
	Although we have an inside joke about Christian girls in the pick up community. The more she professes to be a devout Christian the more of a slut she is <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Do not believe for a second that religious girls won't fuck on a dime. But of course overcoming some of that cultural programming can be a pain sometimes and may not be worth it. Do you really want to sleep with a stage Blue girl? Careful what you wish for.
</p>

<p>
	Make your life easy and look for girls who are comfortable with their sexuality.
</p>

<p>
	When you go to a bar/club the whole point is that the girls there are DTF. Anyone in a bar/club is fair game. They aren't there for intellectual stimulation.
</p>

<p>
	The best thing you can do for your game is move to a large city with lots of girls and good nightlife. You're not gonna get good with girls living in the countryside.

<title>No Mind and I Am Not My Body Experiences at Meditation Course</title>

<p>
	Sweet.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, the ego-mind will recoil in horror upon realization of the Void. It comes as a jolt of terror down to your bones. Existential horror.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is the biggest thing holding you back from God.
</p>

<p>
	If you're not doing psychedelics, retreats are crucial for awakening because the only way to match the power of a psychedelic is with days upon days of uninterrupted concentration/meditation. That's why you had your Void encounter on retreat. It's hard to get that kind of uninterrupted concentration at home.
</p>

<p>
	There will be no awakening without laser focused concentration for hours on end.
</p>

<p>
	Good work.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, it's best not to take your partners or friends with you because it creates a distraction. You don't want to be worrying about what he is thinking or feeling or what he's doing. That breaks your concentration.
</p>

<p>
	Next time, go solo. If he wants to do retreats, have him take a different one. Awakening is not a team sport.
</p>

<p>
	Simple. The people in academia are self-biased fools. Richard Dawkins style.
</p>

<p>
	Science has validated paranormal phenomena long ago beyond reasonable doubt. The studies and data are simply denied. They have to be, or else the entire credibility of materialist science crumbles.

<p>
	It was my debates with him about evolution and God which got me to start contemplating epistemology from which all of Actualized.org was spawned. By contemplating epistemology I got my philosophy degree in university.
</p>

<p>
	After a debate with Tiago and his dumb Christian friends, I would come home and contemplate the nature of human knowledge. I was baffled how such people could be Christians and believe the Earth was 5000 years old. It made no sense to me back then.
</p>

<p>
	I allude to this in one of my older videos on epistemology.
</p>

<p>
	The Mechanics of Belief, or was it The Ultimate Model of Human Knowledge?
</p>

<p>
	Can't recall.
</p>

<p>
	I wonder if he's still a Christian?

			That's it? So, you rarely if ever enjoyed the journey to achieving success with women? I mean, are you telling me that there's nothing I can do about dealing with the constant pain of rejection and failure, except just bare it all like a tragic victim? What if you feel began to feel suicidal and hopeless about dating, sex, and romance?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, I never said it was all suffering and pain. I said SOME nights. Other times it can fun, exciting, positive, etc. Overall it's an adventure. Don't think of it as some negative chore you must do.
</p>

<p>
	I don't understand why you need to feel suicidal about it. If you're doing the work, there's plenty of hope and no need for suicide. You will get laid if you go out enough. I guarantee it.

<p>
	I'm kidding (sorta). I know what you mean.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, of course it's possible to build loving relationships. But in order to do that you must first fully understand how deep survival goes. People often jump into things calling it "love" when really it's survival masquerading as love. Of course survival too is love. But that's not what you want. You want something higher. We can get to something higher, but we need to start with a solid foundation first.

<p>
	Those are technical words.
</p>

<p>
	All words are relative. You gotta learn how they are used within a certain paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Of course things are confusing to the ego-mind. That's the whole challenge of this work. It takes years to un-con-fuse things.

<p>
	Is it really so hard to understand what a devil is? Or what love is? Or what God is? These things can be explained to a child.

<p>
	If it is ever complete, yes, it will be a massive tome over 1000 pages.
</p>

<p>
	But it will also contain many colorful illustrations and diagrams.
</p>

<p>
	I have a few parts written and probably 1000 pages of outlines and notes.

<p>
	Figuring out how to organize it all into a linear sequence is the biggest challenge.

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	Both genders are looking to maximize survival of the ego-mind. Whatever that entails. Each ego-mind has it's own priorities and needs which it self-biasedly justifies as "authentic", "true", and "good". It's all illusions and devilry within devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is not about truth.
</p>

<p>
	A truthful relationship is a virtually non-existent thing. They are rarer than hen's teeth. You can create one, but it's nothing that happens automatically.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's important to distinguish attraction vs dating vs relationship.
</p>

<p>
	These are distinct phases. What I'm talking about here is mostly the first phase: attraction, without which nothing else is possible.
</p>

<p>
	Once the relationship begins for real (after a few times of sex), then things change.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend all guys practice what I call Conscious Relationship. Which is a huge topic which I won't explain here. Suffice it to say, you ladies would love it. It's everything you want out of a relationship and much more. It's the thing you wish pickup was because you're not concerned about the attraction phase much.
</p>

<p>
	I am by no means only about attraction and anti-relationship. I think there's lots of value in intimate relationship. But before we get there, we gotta bang <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> There's a certain order of operations to the mating game.

<p>
	Women are attracted to cocky guys. Stop listening to what women logically tell you they want.
</p>

<p>
	The ability to talk endlessly about yourself is crucial. That's what all extroverts know how to do to initiate and sustain conversation.
</p>

<p>
	It's not egotistical.
</p>

<p>
	"Today I blew out my tire. Then this happened. Then that happened." etc. That's how conversation is made.

<p>
	Yes, that's the catch-22 of it.
</p>

<p>
	How do you handle it? Same way you handle getting a job. You slowly build up experience through practice. Even if you are needy, it's not like 0% of women will sleep with you. There will still be 1 in 100 who will. You can also, like, keep your neediness suppressed for a while while you're with a girl. It's not like all of your inner demons need to be worn on your sleeve. She can't know you're needy unless you act needy in front of her.
</p>

<p>
	There is an element of fake it till you make it in this process. Same as with getting a job.

<p>
	Nonduality is not a model or a temporary experience.
</p>

<p>
	You're wasting time with this. Stop trying to model nonduality. This an absurdity by definition.

<p>
	You cannot have alternative versions of Truth. Truth is singular and absolute.

<p>
	You are not appreciating how radical this thing called "Truth" is. Your mind cannot hold it, it holds your mind.

<p>
	That's precisely the case.
</p>

<p>
	There is perfect balance between freedom and limitation.
</p>

<p>
	Maximization of Love is a meta thing. It's not just love, it's meta-Love. Meta-Love means that God doesn't force things to be loving, God's Love is too advanced for such brute force methods. God let's Love breathe. God creates space for all beings to co-create Love. That is True Love. That is Meta-Love. It's a Love that allows all beings to love according to their capacity.
</p>

<p>
	God's Love for Hitler allows Hitler the ability to express his love by killing 10 million people. If God forced Hitler to be a nice man that wouldn't be maximum Love. That would be selfishness.

<p>
	Match is part of the process.
</p>

<p>
	Of course not every woman will be a match with every man. That's all sorted out in the field.
</p>

<p>
	It's not like if a guy has game he can attract/sleep with 100% of women. About 33% of women will love him, 33% of women will hate him, and 33% of women will be indifferent.
</p>

<p>
	There's always an element of luck and personalities need to match up. That's why he chats with 10 women, 3 get attracted, 1 comes home.
</p>

<p>
	A highly attractive man is actually more polarizing. Some women will absolutely hate him. But those who like him will LOVE him.
</p>

<p>
	You also have to keep in mind that not all guys with game are the same. Each guys attracts a specific subset of female personality types. Because game is expressed differently through different personality types. Game is not a specific type of guy, it's general principles of attractiveness which are incarnated uniquely by each guy, attracting different kinds of women. For example, humor is going to vary from guy to guy. Guys can have very different senses and styles of humor. But learning the general principles of humor will help every guy, no matter what his style of humor is. And all girls love some style of humor. Humor can be dry, witty, intellectual, sexual, subdued, bold, sarcastic, self-deprecating, dark, physical, nerdy, etc.

<p>
	That's such a huge topic.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a few things quickly off the top of my head:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Laser eye contact
	</li>
	<li>
		Learning to create a genuine smile on a dime
	</li>
	<li>
		Firm, commanding tone of voice. Slowing down your rate of speech.
	</li>
	<li>
		Being relaxed and at ease in your body when talking
	</li>
	<li>
		Simply lots of socialization and conversation experience (doesn't even have to be with women).
	</li>
	<li>
		The stuff I talk about in my video: How To Be Funny
	</li>
	<li>
		The ability to talk about yourself endlessly.
	</li>
	<li>
		Dressing sharp. Get all of your clothing tailored for slim fit. Groom yourself well. Upgrade your whole wardrobe to be stylish. Develop a sense of style that suits you.
	</li>
	<li>
		The ability to be playful and laugh at yourself and life
	</li>
	<li>
		Handle your sexual neediness so that you aren't sexually needy
	</li>
	<li>
		Develop charisma -- I have a good book about charisma on my book list.
	</li>
	<li>
		Passion for life. You must be building an awesome life for yourself aside from girls/sex/relationship. The girl should be the least important part of your life. Your life should be so awesome that anyone who comes into contact with you would feel lucky. You must be in love with yourself and your life.
	</li>
	<li>
		Self-Love. Accept yourself as you are, completely. Be thrilled to be you. Treat yourself as God's gift to the world and to women.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>

<p>
	Of course most guys doing game are Orange, and some even Red. I've known guys who do game who are flat out rapists with pending legal cases against them. But this is rare. Most guys are Orange. Yes, many guys objectify women and sex. But you also have to understand, this is not a function of game itself, this is simply how most guys today think about sex. A stage Orange man will objectify women whether he learns game or not.
</p>

<p>
	Russell Brand used to be heroin addict. So, yeah, people grow.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's "locker room talk"? Honestly, lots of guys talk that way behind closed doors. That's excessive Orange mentality. It's just hidden.
</p>

<p>
	You have too appreciate that pickup brings up into the open what has been repressed and hidden for centuries. Stage Blue repressed sex so much for so long that stage Orange swings in the opposite direction. There is still a social stigma about being open about the reality of dating and sex. Dating can be ruthless. Not just from the man's side from the woman's side too. Women are not angels in all this. They too are constantly manipulating to meet their survival needs.

<p>
	You are unwittingly condemning men to stay losers.
</p>

<p>
	Become a charming man is not something that happens naturally for most guys due to poor social conditioning. Becoming a man takes work! Being shy, unsociable, self-conscious, meek, fearful, angry, bitter, lonely, needy, inarticulate, poor at physical touch, bad sense of humor, etc -- these are not natural. This is the result of bad upbringing and lack of training.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what source the man got his charm from. If he's charming, he's charming. That's real and girls respond accordingly because they don't care about the backstory of how he became charming.

					You have to understand that attraction and sex are not a logical thing. All your logic and excuses will fly out the window as soon as the right guy shows up who knows how to push your buttons.
				</p>

				<p>
					The whole magic of game is that cuts through the logic that women use to stop themselves from having sex.
				</p>

				<p>
					It's possible to narrate to a woman every step of the game you're run on her, and she will still fall under its spell. Because its not logical. In fact, I've done just that as a technique. It still works. Attraction happens on a subconscious level. A guy charms his way into your pants. It's spooky.
				</p>
			</div>
		</blockquote>

		<p>
			My experience of my sexuality differs from this. Though I could see how it would work on women who don't have a very strong intuition or boundaries or who are just lonely... which probably describes like 25% of women. So, it's a sizable enough minority to find a sexual partner as a man. But I don't think this is typical.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's certainly not logical. But usually the guy is someone I have either a platonic friendship with or an acquaintance relationship to. And it isn't based on looks or any other specific trait. But the draw is curiosity about his energy at a distance. It's always the question of whether or not the guy is interested and the wondering of what's happening in his mind. So, it is introversion and nonchalance and lack of clear interest that attracts me along with his general energy.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not 25% of women. 100% of heterosexual women.
</p>

<p>
	What you describe in your 2nd paragraph: the vibe, the energy, the nonchalance... that's exactly what game is.
</p>

<p>
	You are thinking of game as a set of tricks men use to maniuplate women to sleep with them. But that's not real game, that's crap game. Real game is a man simply behaving in a strong, authentic, masculine way which generates a really charming vibe that girls cannot resist.
</p>

<p>
	The charm isn't fake, it's real! The woman gets attracted not because she is verbally tricked, but because the guy is actually being an awesome guy to his bones.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine your dream guy: strong, bold, charming, smooth, natural, funny, cool, exuding masculine vibe. That's what pickup trains a guy how to be. And once a guy becomes that way, every girl wants to marry him. The trick is, once a guy becomes that way he has so many options that he may not want to get married to any one girl. And thus a player is born.
</p>

<p>
	Despite what they say, girls love players. She simply wants to lock him down for herself. That is the real issue. Girls struggle with players because they are hard to lock down.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, sex is a marketplace and girls do not want to admit that.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Palestinians have their own problems.
</p>

<p>
	But the US's role should have been to be a fair, neutral broker. But the Trump admin is incapable of neutrality.

<p>
	Yes, a long mushroom session can result in a headache. It passes in a day or so.

	You only strached the surface. The non-personal existential questions are when things get interesting.

<p>
	Of course psychics are real.
</p>

<p>
	The doubt itself is silly if you have sufficient experience working with them.
</p>

<p>
	What's fake is the materialist denial of psychics. Materialism is a joke.

<p>
	Truth includes static and dynamic, and an infinite number of other possibilities.

	They were definitely not memories but entirely unique mystical and nondual experiences with new genuine insights.

	Many years ago, before I started Actualized or knew about awakening, once in a dream I accidentally became conscious of the infinity of consciousness. But I lacked the theoretical framework to understand the significance of that experience, so I sort of forgot about it.
</p>

<p>
	If you think back about your whole lifetime of dreaming, maybe you can recall a few such moments.

<p>
	How badly do you want to get good? That's the key question. As Zizek would say, are you willing to sell your mother into slavery to get good with girls? If not, your results will be mediocre. You need serious vision and drive here. You will have to work your ass off for it. Having sex with lots of hot women is not something that life just hands you on a silver platter. Becoming a highly attractive man is a huge makeover project. It involves making deep structural changes to your entire lifestyle and way of thinking.

<p>
	You have to understand that attraction and sex are not a logical thing. All your logic and excuses will fly out the window as soon as the right guy shows up who knows how to push your buttons.
</p>

<p>
	The whole magic of game is that cuts through the logic that women use to stop themselves from having sex.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible to narrate to a woman every step of the game you're run on her, and she will still fall under its spell. Because its not logical. In fact, I've done just that as a technique. It still works. Attraction happens on a subconscious level. A guy charms his way into your pants. It's spooky.

And I should here note, lots of people do stupid things. So I can't speak to that. My personal standard is always extreme carefulness with any psychedelic substance.

<p>
	Eating raw foods definitely improves clarity of mind. The challenge is getting enough calories and doing all the prep work since you gotta make it all yourself. It's a huge volume of matter just to chew through. It's also very expensive.

<p>
	Yes, I've had extremely deep and powerful awakenings inside of dreams. They are as legit as any other. The problem is they fade pretty fast and it's harder to build a bridge between them and "real life".
</p>

<p>
	Still, a dream awakening is better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Try to translate it to real life.

<p>
	It takes a lot of study and practice and inner work to reach a point where you can apply Spiral Dynamics accurately.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a simple model, which is why it's so good.
</p>

<p>
	And it takes an even deeper understanding of epistemology and consciousness work to realize when to let go of Spiral Dynamics, or as I like to say, how to "hold a model loosely".
</p>

<p>
	You have to be able to use a model and be able to let it go on a dime. This is part of the epistemological work. All models are limited by definition and you have to develop such flexibility of mind that you can jump from one model to another the way a professional photographer switches lenses. And then you have to be able to "shoot raw", without any lenses at all.

<p>
	You need a lot of practice physically escalating on a girl in a noncreepy way. Learning how to touch her is crucial for success. Touching is so important. Start touching her with 3 seconds of meeting her and don't let up. Escalate your touching all throughout the date.
</p>

<p>
	Google: "kino escalation ladder"
</p>

<p>
	You need to learn kino
</p>

<p>
	You need to take every chance you can to touch her to make her comfortable with your touch. Start with playful, non-erotic touching, then ramp it up to the heavy stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Yes. I have done 13 days in a row. Works every time, and they will get stronger and stronger. Your ego will cry uncle long before you reach a month. Your mind will be shattered from all the mindfuckery. Don't be surprised if you feel like you're going insane and having a mental breakdown from which there is no return.

<p>
	1) Empty stomach != empty ass
</p>

<p>
	2) That microscoop needs to be calibrated to each substance. It can vary quite a bit. For some substances it will be 10mg and for others up to 20mg because density varies. You need a miligram scale to calibrate it.
</p>

<p>
	It's not unusual for some people to need 35mg+ when plugging.
</p>

<p>
	For me personally 15mg is an epic trip. But I'm Leo and you're not.
</p>

<p>
	You could always try snorting it. The dose for snorting vs plugging should be very similar. Just make sure it doesn't all drip down your throat. It must get absorbed in the nose. This requires a very gentle snort and flipping your head upside down for 10 mins so it doesn't drip out.
</p>

<p>
	Snorting is gross and will burn, but still worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Careful, snorting can be powerful.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You're doing good, but all that is just the tip of the iceberg. I suggest you contemplate more existential questions. Such as:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What is reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		What am I?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is love?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	It would also be a good idea to upgrade from mushrooms to research chems, as they are more powerful, more clear, and more versatile.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms are too tricky and squirrely.
</p>

<p>
	If you want ego death, contemplate What is death? / What is a self? / What is ego?
</p>

<p>
	You should be aiming for 50-100 trips to sort all these questions out. There is too much material there.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup leads to that if you want. Most guys who get into pickup just want to get a nice girlfriend. They are not going to bang 100 girls.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you sleep with 10-20 girls, you get that out of your system, and you settle down with one who's right for you. Not much different than normal social people do.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, people who are social can easily have 10-20 sexual partners, simply because they are so social and have ample opportunities. A hot girl will easily have 10-20 sexual partners in her lifetime. She is fucking around. She just keeps it secret.

<p>
	LOL, you haven't read about how many gurus sleep with their students?
</p>

<p>
	Gurus have optimized pickup so much that they don't even need to go to the club/bar, the girls flock to them. This is the ultimate form of pickup. It's like shooting fish in a barrel. Getting laid as a guru is the easiest thing in the world. Which is a big reason why spiritual communities are formed. If you start a spiritual community you are automatically guaranteed sex. Of course it all turns into a toxic mess soon enough.

	Ralston's awakening came from intense self-inquiry retreats where me contemplated "Who am I?" for 3 weeks non-stop.
</p>

<p>
	And Ralston is a freak of nature. None of you here have his contemplation or focus abilities.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	He's done over 10,000 hours of retreats.

<p>
	Again, you guys are only looking at the surface. If you had actually read Suzanne Segal's life story you would know that she spent years doing intense, hardcore TM meditation. She was a high level TM instructor. And THEN her awakening came spontaneously some years after she quit TM.
</p>

<p>
	She mediated for 10 hours a day or more. None of you here have ever done that much spiritual work.

	Fools gold. None of it was spontaeneous. You just don't realize the work that went into it. You are only looking as the end result.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Key word there is "seems".
</p>

<p>
	It seems that way because you don't know how much effort it took.
</p>

<p>
	It took Neale Donald Walch over a year to channel the first book over many sessions. And of course his notes were heavily edited and polished. He did not just sit down and the whole booked poured out of him in one week.
</p>

<p>
	You guys have to be careful with you assumptions. When you see a spiritual teacher or teaching you are only seeing the end result. You have no clue how much work was done behind the scenes and how ugly the work looked.
</p>

<p>
	That's one of the reasons I'm sharing raw footage of my awakening process. It's going to look very messy when it's happening to you. It's not going be like Ekhart Tolle sitting stoicly on a chair. It's going to feel more like you're ready to put a gun in your mouth and pull the trigger. But no one shows you that part.

<p>
	Just the opposite. When the mind is closed, death is its only salvation.
</p>

<p>
	This is a message of highest compassion.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you are welcome to open your mind prior to the death of that mind. God hopes you do. But just in case you don't, God has made sure that that mind will die.
</p>

<p>
	I'm just explaining to you Plan B.

<p>
	A difference you are imagining.
</p>

<p>
	You are really going to debate the definition of "throw"?

			How do you set a date, dont get anxious in the date as to not making it bored, and then get laid. Or even less, to get out of the needy state while in the date. Or did you just went on a date if you where prepared into the mood? Consciously settings dates while being unconcious is fckng tricky. This is when you start seeing all the glitches in the matrix.
		</p>

<p>
	First of all, you are far more needy than even you admit. Not just with online dates but offline dates too. When the opportunity for good sex presents itself, your mind will start craving it and clinging to it.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you so overthinking this? All you gotta know is: Do you want to have sex with that person? If yes, set up the fucking date and be interested in it, yet detached and non-needy.
</p>

<p>
	How do you become non-needy? By going on dozens of dates with dozens of people until it starts to feel normal.
</p>

<p>
	It also helps to have a decent amount of sex (with one person or many) so that you get your sexual hunger satisfied, at least somewhat. Most men are like starved dogs who haven't eaten in a month. Of course you will be needy for food in that situation.
</p>

<p>
	Look, the reality is, if you're just starting PUA you will be very needy for the first year or two. That's par for the course. Struggle through it and do the best you can. Try to contain your neediness when possible. As you see how your neediness turns off and loses you many hot girls, the pain of those losses will teach you to surrender your neediness more and more.
</p>

You haven't contemplated that point about apples and oranges deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	A human avatar is a finite thing. It is not meant to muck around with the physical laws. For the same reason that Trump is not allowed to rewrite the US Constitution to suit his will. Because his will is the will of a devil.
</p>

<p>
	How would you like it if Trump could materialize a bomb over your head? You'd be here complaining about how evil God is to allow such a thing. Yet when God disallows such a thing, you are here complaining about it. Because you are not clearly thinking through what you're asking. It's like you're a baby playing with a loaded gun, completely oblivious of what it can do. And you complain when your parents hide it from you.

<p>
	Yes, and I'm pointing out to you that Jesus was an avatar.
</p>

<p>
	The Godhead cannot be hated or loved by people because only the awakened know that a Godhead even exists. You can't see the Godhead, only its avatar.

<p>
	An avatar for basketball.
</p>

<p>
	The Godhead doesn't play basketball since it is absolutely formless.
</p>

<p>
	Look up the definition of "avatar".

	He rarely makes a big picture point. He likes to ramble around, lost in details and examples, down some rabbit hole.

	It can be negative, but it can also be healthy and positive. If you value improving your country for the benefit of all citizens, that's a good thing. If you turn it into nationalism, that's a toxic thing.
</p>

<p>
	I didn't want to exclude stage Blue people. Many of them value service to country/culture. Yes, it can become toxic, but doesn't have to.
