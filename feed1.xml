	They literally only exist when you are aware of them. Like in a video game. There is no static video game world other than what is rendered on the screen. The screen is it.

<p>
	There's no solution to this other than finding another girl.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is not a conscious choice. You do not choose what you get attracted to.
</p>

<p>
	She herself cannot satisfy her own standards for you. She will certainly not be turned on by any random guy.
</p>

<p>
	It's your responsibility as a man to screen girls hard right off the bat to meet your attractiveness standards. Stop settling for mediocre girls. By not screening harder you are doing a disservice to the girl, since you won't be passionate about her.
</p>

<p>
	This assumes so much.
</p>

<p>
	It assumes you see him as human.

<p>

<p>
	None of this is the case without education, training, and infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
	YOU ARE SELFISH. You do not care about the pain of others. Your survival hinges on you not caring.
</p>

<p>
	If you could push a magic button to receive a perfect sex slave who will fulfill all of your deepest desires on command, you would push that button and you would not care about her feelings. You and your friends would then invent an ideology which justifies why you all deserve to have sex slaves.

<p>
	I'm open to it. We need to move in that direction. But unlike most socialists I'm not naive enough to think that it will all just auto-magically work without leadership. Co-ops will need leadership.

<p>
	We need more co-ops, but we need more conscious, visionary leadership too.

	I'm extremely skeptical of any flat-hierarchy organizations. If they worked, they would have been done from day one. The problem is they are inefficient and directionless. Design by committee doesn't work so well. Majority of people are lazy, ignorant, stupid, and without vision or ambition.

<p>
	I'd rather take a pure clean hit of DMT via a simple oil pipe. Oil pipe works excellent. Yes, it can be fucking intense if you dose too high. So dose low. You can always redose and keep a steady high going.

Libertarians usually don't give a damn about racism, since most of them lean right-wing. And a libertarian would tend to argue that math and logic are absolute truths since libertarians do not understand relativity.

	Plugging is far more precise than vaping. You never know if you vaporized or inhaled the full dose. With plugging you get the full thing every time.

		Stop using 5-MeO and switch to DMT. If DMT is more profound and mystical for you, why aren't you using it more? You need to find the chem that works for you. If 40mg of vaped 5-MeO-DMT don't clearly show you God, then it's not the right chem for you.
	</li>
	<li>
		Don't hide your stuff in a book. That's the first place anyone would look. Be more clever.
	</li>
</ul>

I can't wrap my head around what you went through to do 5-meo-dmt for 30 days consecutively. Or how Kilindi Lyi did 30 g of mushrooms. Seems like it's a mix of expert level experience and extreme courage.

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is not as challenging for me as DMT or salvia.
</p>

<p>
	Although by the 25th day of 5-MeO, things got pretty hairy and I was starting to lose my mind.

<p>
	Sure, slaves probably feel oppressed.
</p>

<p>
	But the point is that the slave masters don't feel they are doing anything wrong. They feel entitled to having slaves in the same way that you feel entitled to eating plants and animals. You don't feel you're doing anything wrong when you eat a carrot. Neither does a slave master.

<p>
	A) That's still all relative.
</p>

<p>
	B) Humans can only raise their consciousness like that through education and cultural evolution, which requires massive social infrastructure. You can't have the majority of humans become conscious enough to realize that slavery is selfish without first building a massive government which educates them about such things and provides them systems, regulations, and controls to meet their selfish needs in more kind ways.

	Fundamentally, no two communities can remain isolated from each other. It's always only a matter of time before they start to bump into each other, cross-pollinate, and merge.
</p>

<p>
	It is impossible for two villages to simply live near each other without interaction. And much of that interaction will not be voluntary or lovely. Libertarians fundamentally do not understand this.

<p>
	Psychedelics are so powerful that you will never get used to giant doses. You're not going to out-macho psychedelics. They will always kick your ass if you take too much. So be careful. Infinite Consciousness is not a thing to be trifled with.
</p>

<p>
	I find high doses of DMT downright terrifying. It's too much consciousness for a human to handle.

<p>
	We are not going to discuss Red Pill here.
</p>

<p>
	Red Pill will not get you laid, it will just corrupt your mind with negativity and anger.
</p>

<p>
	To get good with women you must be positive and constructive. Blaming women for your problems is the last thing you wanna do. Women are amazing when you learn how to interact with them properly. You should be looking to create win-win situations.

<p>
	Here's a good list of tips for you newbies:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hmfdu7/the_most_common_mistakes_guys_make_in_the_field/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/seduction/comments/hmfdu7/the_most_common_mistakes_guys_make_in_the_field/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes the best pickup advice you will find written as simple online posts by anonymous guys who clearly hit the field. There's tons of this stuff available online.
</p>

<p>
	Look for guys who sound like they spend a lot of time in the field, and take notes on their tips and top lessons. Then follow those as you hit the field yourself. That's basically how you learn game in a nutshell. It's not very fancy or complicated. You just need to figure out the top 20 or 30 principles and practice them religiously.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most valuable parts of RSD was their forum, with Field Reports and advanced practitioners posting their highest lessons and tips. That alone was enough to learn game. Too bad it's all gone now. But you can find other online sources.
</p>

I assume when we vote we subconsciously automatically choose the most conscious from our perspective. I would always choose the most conscious candidate from my pov and I assume everyone else would do the same from their povs. But how could we get to agree to have a similar pov? Aren't difference and relativity inherent in reality? If we were already in agreement, then wouldn't the whole political system collapse cause it would be useless? Doesn't politics exists mainly to unite our differences?

<p>
	It's pretty easy to see who is more conscious if you are doing consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	Or just rely on Spiral Dynamics as a rough guide.
</p>

<p>
	Of course most people will be biased in favor of their fave candidate.

<p>
	I just intuitively felt the entire pickup culture was low-consciousness and toxic from the moment I visited their forums. But I also knew that they had solid dating advice, and these two things are separate. There is nothing wrong with techniques and theory in itself. It just needs to be used responsibly with compassion for the woman.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to business. You can learn business techniques which can be applied ethically to benefit your customers or unethically to exploit your customers.

<p>
	The deeper issue here is this: you interactions with women need to be obviously charged with sexual intent that if a woman pays you any compliment at whatsoever, she knows she's implicitly asking to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	You need to make it clear with the first 5 minutes of meeting a girl that this is not a friend-to-friend interaction.

<p>
	Julien was a juvenile idiot drunk on the power of RSD culture.
</p>

<p>
	This is the kind of thing I criticized in my A Rant Against The Pickup Community video.
</p>

<p>
	There was a fundamental lack of concern for the woman's feelings within RSD culture. Women were treated as disposable dogs. I clearly saw it as a problem just before this whole debacle with Julien blew up in his face.
</p>

<p>
	It all could have been avoided if Owen put some emphasis on ethics. The selfishness was just off the charts within RSD culture. It became toxic.

<p>
	I'm not gonna get into all those details. Keep your nose in your own business.

<p>
	Suffice it to say that you have no idea my situation. So watch your assumptions.

<p>
	I already shared my experience. It has even been rendered for you visually above.
</p>

<p>
	I never knew him well. But he struck me a scummy.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, it's not like the RSD guys are not scummy. Jeffy is a pretty huge scumbag and it doesn't end with him.

<p>
	John and Jeffy are in a similar ballpark.

	Yeah. Most PUAs suck at sex and they have no idea how much quality sex they are missing by not going deep with one girl.

	OMG the kinds of sex that are possible from going deep with one girl. Most humans cannot imagine it. Godly levels of sex are possible!

			You can definitely tell how obsessed he is with game, he even admits it comes from a childhood of verbal abuse From his mother (so now has a need for female validation), being a “nerd” in high school & an analytical mind + an addictive personality, and of course a sex addiction must play a role. That’s why I made it clear you have to make his teachings conscious, people like that will do whatever it takes to get what he wants, I liked his advice as it was very practical with flow charts & what not for every situation/ objection, like you said there’s still things to learn there, I just don’t want to partake in the unethical side of things at all.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ethical game is certainly harder than unethical game, there’s no debating that, same in business like you said.
		</p>

		<p>
			But, we can still learn things from these people just like we can learn great business practices from unethical ones & apply them in a much more ethical manner <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />

<p>
	Certainly you can learn how to be effective from a sociopath.
</p>

<p>
	I once accidentally bumped into John at Walmart while I was shopping. I had only met him like once before and we didn't know each other well. But he recognized me at Walmart and came to say hello. He immediately pulled out his phone and started showing me pictures of girls he banged the previous night. I thought it was so lame and desperate that he was trying to impress me with his lay count. I think he's on an ego trip.
</p>

<p>
	Come to think of it, every time I bumped into him at the club our brief conversations consisted of him bragging to me about his ever-increasing lay count.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I never got the appeal of having a high lay count. He is obsessed with that shit. I feel sorry for the girls who sleep with him.
</p>

	Just cause he's a sociopath doesn't make him unreal. He certainly gets results. Most sociopaths are highly effective.
</p>

<p>
	Ethical game is harder than unethical game, just like ethical business is harder than unethical business.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, John also got kicked off the RSD forums when he tried to secretly use their forum to steal their clients.
</p>

<p>
	My Rant Against Pickup video was a reaction to this kind of stuff I saw in the community. Many PUAs lack ethics and RSD certainly didn't teach ethics and actually glorified unethical behavior -- creating a toxic combo.

<p>
	Lol. You are confusing things.
</p>

<p>
	The notion of "large" is what is relative. Nothing in the universe is "large" unless you specify some other thing RELATIVE TO which it would be large.
</p>

<p>
	So, for example, if there only existed one object in the universe -- like one elephant -- it would be impossible to say whether it was large or not, since that notion is literally meaningless without some relative comparison.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise, nothing in the universe is bad, or expensive, or upside-down, or ugly, or powerful, or hot, or fast, or heavy unless you compare it next to some other thing.
</p>

<p>
	To put this very broadly: it is impossible for God to know what anything is other than by comparison to something else.
</p>

<p>
	So, God himself cannot tell you how old God is because God is the only thing that exists and therefore there is no outside comparison which it could make to determine its own age. Hence God is timeless and Eternal.
</p>

<p>
	Which is precisely why God is Absolute. And since God is everything, that means everything is Absolute. Which means that the relative and the absolute are identical.

	Nuts make me nauseous.

<p>
	Avocados are okay but they are difficult to keep in stock given how quickly they spoil. And half the time they are rotten inside or hard like a brick.

Like can't they see that "racist" people are not the big elephant in the room? They demand laws and reforms, isn't that just waste of time which leads to poor results at the end? Can any law, or reform fix the problems of Black Americans?

<p>
	To be frank, plenty of guys do pickup because they just want a bunch of hot sex or because for them it's an ego/power trip. They get drunk off the power they feel from it. This is the shadow side of pickup. It can be very harmful. So be careful. You will meet a lot of damaged, shameless, and egotistical guys within pickup. Don't become like that.

	Careful. John is a straight up rapist. I met him when he was in Vegas 6 years ago. He had a pending rape legal case against him. He takes game waaaaaay too far. He is very coercive with girls. I don't recommend you go down that dark road.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, you want to be careful not to hurt girls in this process. Don't make her regret sleeping with you. And also, don't make pickup look bad by being so hardcore about it.
</p>

<p>
	With great power comes great responsibility. He certainly abuses his power.
</p>

<p>
	He is ripe for a #MeToo takedown.

<p>
	I mean the whole package. The entirety of a girl's value. This includes sexual value, reproductive value, social value, etc. Basically, the needs in you that she satisfies and how well she satisfies them.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously this is relative to every guy. But also, guys have similar needs and desires, thus creating competition for the highest value girls. If she has a perfect pair of tits and a six figure salary, she will be much harder to attract and keep. So you better bring some of your own value to the negotiating table. A girl subconsciously knows her own value.

<p>
	Sure. Most people are just normies.
</p>

<p>
	I'm talking here within the context of transforming yourself with regards to dating and as a man. This is not for everyone.
</p>

<p>
	Pickup is right for you only if you want to seriously transform yourself as a man and you want much higher quality girls than you would normally be able to get. If you're just happy with an average girl, then pickup is probably overkill.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be interested in the actual process of it, not just the end result. The learning journey is the best part.

			But it is also noteworthy how quickly libertarian economic-thinking is vanishing.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not so fast!
</p>

<p>
	Libertarianism has infected much of the Republican party and their donor class -- because it's so convenient for them. People who's survival depends on the exploitation of others LOVE the libertarian ideology because it weakens the regulations which keep such exploitation in check.
</p>

<p>
	The Trump administration's explicitly stated goal is "the deconstruction of the administrative state", as Steve Bannon put it:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kPFpTergAGQ?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	The problem is that libertarianism rarely exists in its pure form. In the real world it get alloyed with all sorts of conservative ideology such as nationalism and religious fundamentalism.
</p>

<p>
	As we speak the Trump admin is deregulating and privatizing as much of the government as possible, making it easier for the strong to exploit the weak.
</p>

<p>
	"Political termites" is a great phrase from David Cay Johnston:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c_IcY5VFPKk?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	So in practice libertarianism becomes the handmaiden of shameless arch-capitalists who stand to gain the most from the exploitation opportunities which libertarianism opens up.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the ego is incredibly ingenious and sneaky. It will use an ideology like libertarianism -- which nominally values non-aggression and consensual agreements -- in order to get rid of the referee, and then use that opportunity to dominate the field. And by the time that happens, it's too late. You're powerless to reverse it.
</p>

He now thinks most of libertarianism is just a huge smokescreen created to gain popular support for neo-liberal economic policies which actually serve corporations and the rich, Milton Friendman being a typical example of neo-liberal propaganda disguised as libertarian belief. I wonder whether you think that's possible.

<p>
	I wouldn't ascribe it a conscious malicious motive. It's just part of the the stage Orange worldview.
</p>

<p>
	By definition every ideology serves someone's survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	It's not really propaganda. Milton was true believer. Libertarians are true believers. They are just naive about human nature. They expect everyone to be as ethical as them. And they don't recognize their own devilry.
</p>

<p>
	It's not an accident that many billionaires gravitate towards libertarianism. Of course it's highly convenient for them.

<p>
	Blueprint is very old.
</p>

<p>
	Tyler's free YT videos circa 2010-2014 were the shit. Total game-changer.
</p>

<p>
	Some other coaches I liked:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		David Wygant (daygame)
	</li>
	<li>
		Mehow (he had some of the earliest in-field vids in the industry)
	</li>
	<li>
		David DeAngelo (solid dating theory that's less hardcore than pickup)
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	They are rather old now, but their material was very helpful for me when I started out.
</p>

<p>
	Also research Mystery's original Kino Escalation ladder. That's gold.
</p>

<p>
	You can basically piece together a master map of pickup by studying every coach under the sun. Watch a couple hundred hours of material, take notes, and piece together your own personal map of female attraction.
</p>

<p>
	But be careful. Pickup theory is addictive. You need to go out on the streets to really learn how the theory applies.
</p>

<p>
	Each hour of theory requires like 10 to 100 hours in-field ACTION to learn.
</p>

It's far more profound than that.
</p>

<p>
	If you were Omniscient you would realize that cancer is something you're imagining. You would also realize that you are immortal and that cancer is no threat to you. You would already realize that cancer is Love and that nothing needs to change. You would also realize that God has no control of itself because God is nothing but the highest Love.
</p>

<p>
	God is the realization that there is nothing you can do to change anything. It is TOTAL surrender. What heals you is absolute self-acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	Omniscience is not the knowing of a set of facts. It the realization that you are Infinity.

<p>
	I've tried it multiple times but given my thyroid condition, a vegan diet simply does not give me enough energy to function. I would have to be eating every couple of hours not to feel hungry and cold.
</p>

<p>
	And I do not consume any wheat or grain products. Most vegans eat garbage grains to make up the bulk of their calories.
</p>

<p>
	High carb diets do not make me feel good.

			yeah those ones. Just speaking within story terms, watching a home video is at least a more unified "sequence of events" than two people trying to recount the same story from memory.  It appears to stay the same whether I show the home video to no one, or to hundreds, quite unlike telling a story with words.  Maybe this has nothing to do with time but do you have any thing to say about it? Maybe I'm asking more about recording vs recounting. 
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well... your consciousness and mind is going through a very complex and elaborate process to link up those images on the recording to your entire view of reality and your mind is positioning those images within a certain mental framework which you call time and your personal story.
</p>

<p>
	This mental process is so sophisticated and complex that it's basically impossible to map out in a logical linear sequence.

	Well, there's many layers of reasons why not.

<p>

	We are rapidly raising our collective consciousness when looked at in the geological time scale. But you are looking at this from the tiny time scale of your one personal life.

<p>
	Imagination IS reality.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is however you imagine it is. So if you imagine definite timelines of the entire universe, that's what you create. And if you say you didn't create it, but that it was there before you came along, then that's what you imagine/create.
</p>

<p>
	The key is to understand that YOU ARE FUCKING DOING IT!

</blockquote>

<p>
	You don't have to be all that stuff. That stuff is for guys who want HOT girls.
</p>

<p>
	If you want an ordinary, below-average girl, you can get away with not working on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But this forum is fundamentally about becoming the best that you can be. So we are biased in that way. We want more than the average guy here.
</p>

<p>
	But also, becoming good with women and becoming a high-value guy IS just you being you. Assuming you want to be a high-value guy. If you want to be a lazy guy, then do that. In which case why are you reading about dating advice? Dating advice already assumes you want to improve yourself somehow to get a better result.
</p>

<p>
	If you care about attracting high quality women, you must offer her something in return. Otherwise you're basically trying to cheat her.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the real key to pickup is that it's not about tricking a hot girl to sleep with a lame guy. It's about turning a lame guy into a powerful man, and then girls crave that new guy you have become. In this way you aren't cheating the girl, you are actually transforming yourself for her. You are giving her the gift of the best possible you!
</p>

<p>
	All the fucking work I did on myself, I can now happily gift to a woman for her enjoyment. And that is ultimately the greatest joy of the pickup journey: the joy that women get from who you have become. It's like giving a homeless person a million dollars and seeing the smile on his face.
</p>

<p>
	The average guy gifts his girlfriend a turd.
</p>

<p>
	A guy who works on himself gifts his girlfriend the sparkling diamond which he has become.
</p>

<p>
	Your girlfriend doesn't want a diamond around her finger, she wants a diamond between her legs. She wants you to be her diamond.
</p>

<p>
	And how are diamonds made? Under great pressure. The pressure of life experience forges a weak boy into a powerful man. And it is this purification process which you hate when you say, "I hate this".
</p>

<p>
	Of course it will massively grow your self-esteem and confidence. Especially in the context of women.
</p>

<p>
	But of course it will not fix all your self-esteem issues automatically. There are many dimensions to self-esteem and confidence which pickup will not touch.

<p>
	<strong><span style="font-size:72px;">NO.</span></strong>
</p>

<p>
	We are not gonna get into the inferiority of race debates on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	If you think some races are fundamentally inferior, this forum is not for you.
</p>

<p>
	Let's try to elevate the quality of our conversations here. Is debating the inferiority of black people a good use of your time?

	What can government do to crub teenage pregnancy??? Nothing? Really??? He doesn't know?
</p>

<p>
	Sex ed, free condoms, birth control
</p>

<p>
	This is the lack of systems thinking and collective responsibility that I was talking about.
</p>

<p>
	And actually, government plays a huge role in making people "virtuous". That is the whole point. Good government can enable the development of virtuous citizens.
</p>

<p>
	Government's not good at doing things? Government does the most difficult task in the world, managing a powerful military. If government can do that, it can do a lot of other stuff effectively. The problem is that people like Rand Paul defund government at every corner so of course it can't be good at doing things then.

<p>
	So... I've gotten some pushback from libertartians that I am strawmanning their arguments. Of course we don't want that. So let's see some real-life self-proclaimed libertarians arguing for their ideology and their policy proposals.
</p>

<p>
	Post video examples here so people can get a true sense of how libertarians think and how my critiques of libertarianism applies to their logic.
</p>

<p>
	Then people can judge for themselves if libertarianism holds any water.
</p>

<p>
	You see... one of the things I made sure to do in my Libertarianism critique is to focus on libertarianism <u>as it functions in the real world</u>, not as it is written about in academic books. What I have found is that while libertarianism may sound reasonable in an academic book, when it is practiced by real people in the real world, it looks far less flattering. That's what you'd expect from an ideology which is highly idealistic and philosophical. The philosophy can look good on paper, but then when you use it to build an actual real-world thing, it turns to shit. Similar to what happened with Communism in the Soviet era. It sounded a lot better on paper than it turned out in practice.

<p>
	But there's far more to it than that. Even if he works out his fears, thoughts, emotions, etc. It still won't be good enough.
</p>

<p>
	He needs a radical shift in his state of consciousness. Which is either created through: Intense concentration on the NOW, or taking a chemical.

	Either way, chemical changes are happening.

	You can think of Consciousness like one of those Transitions Glasses lenses which turns dark when sun shines on it, and turns clear when you go indoors. It's the same lens and it's always NOW, but the question is, is it transparent or opaque? If it's opaque, then you ain't awake, and nothing an awake person says will make sense.

<p>
	No, he just has game and you don't. That's the key difference.
</p>

<p>
	The deceptive part is that when you see really good pickup in action, it doesn't look like pickup. It looks totally natural, such that an on-looker would say, "But that's not pickup, that's just a cool guy being friendly." Exactly! But you have no idea what work is involved in becoming that good. On-lookers will only judge you by the end result. They don't know how many hundreds of sets you bombed with cringe to get to this set.

<p>
	You are in the wrong state.

<p>
	All states happen NOW, but you need the right state. So if you're in the wrong state, NOW won't feel like anything special.

<p>
	EVERY newbie makes this mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Attracting females is deeply counter-inutitive. The less you care about them, the more attracted they will get to you.
</p>

<p>
	You can treat her like your dirty, braty sister. Tell her, "If you don't behave, I'm gonna spank you like you're my dirty little sister."
</p>

<p>
	Don't let women boss you around. You have to lead them.
</p>

<p>
	The frame must be that you are more valuable than her. Then she will crave you. Women do not crave weak, low-value males.

<p>
	Basically yes. The hotter the woman, the more true it will be.
</p>

<p>
	The less hot the woman the less value you need to offer as a man to get her.

<p>
	It's an implicit value trade. A sexual auctionhouse.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect women to be able to honestly articulate what she wants in a man. It's all deeply subconscious. She will tell you all sorts of nonsense like, "I want a nice guy." This cannot be trusted. What she logically wants is irrelevant. What matters is what will make her sleep with you.

It was so vicious, we got so beat up on by pirates that we quit the game in frustration. My brother was even scammed for $100 and all his in-game money.
</p>

<p>
	Which perfectly explains why no one wants to live in libertarianland. The bullies dominate everyone else because there is no referee. EVE is a game full of scammers and trolls. In real life such people would rape your children in front of you for sport.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why EVE never went mainstream. It can only exist as a niche game for the most hardcore people.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because on Tinder the women are there shopping for partners/guys, and THE ONLY THING they have to judge you on is your picture. So of course, when framed like that, every woman will choose the hottest looking guy.
</p>

<p>
	By placing yourself like a piece of meat on Tinder, you lose 95% of your value unless you are in the top 10% of physically attractive guys. So the cost of you being lazy is losing 95% of your value. That's what you get for being lazy.
</p>

<p>
	If you approach women in the real world, the entire dynamic changes.

			Now if you're a conservative, the issue you'll run into is that you're not solving anyone's problems, i.e. you're not wanting change, rather you're wanting to defend the status-quo. That isn't very profitable as you're not doing anything! In fact, you're actively trying to hurt the cause of people who are doing something to solve society's problems.

<p>
	Well, your theory is instantly debunked by the existence of Fox News and people like Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones who rake in millions.

</p>

<p>
	Sounds to me like you are texting them in needy ways, since you are needy and inexperienced, and they smell that neediness off you a mile away.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing repels women faster than neediness.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to start going out and learning to build attraction with women face to face. This requires practice. If a woman is really attracted to you, she will not only text back eagerly, within minutes, but she will give you all sorts of compliments to make sure you understand that she want to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	If you fail to attract her, she will be very cold via text. Basically non-responsive. If a girl is non-response or cold via text, that her telling you: I have no interest in you.
</p>

<p>
	Women don't have it easy. Actually guys have it easier because we have the ability to go out make ourselves much more attractive via pickup. Women do not have this option.
</p>

<p>
	You make the mistake of confusing your reproductive agenda with a woman's. Women have a totally different reproductive agenda than men. Pure physical sex is of little value to a woman. That's not what the woman needs. So just because she can easily get it with some random dude is of little help to her.
</p>

<p>
	ATTRACTION CANNOT BE BUILT VIA TEXT! << Burn this into your skull. You must build attraction in-person. Texting is merely a mechanism to set up a date, assuming you have attraction. You cannot compensate for lack of attraction with clever text game. It will not work.
</p>

<p>
	The solution here is simple: channel your frustration into going out and socializing with new girls face to face.
</p>

<p>
	Stop expecting texts to get you laid. They will not.
</p>

			"It was reported that, of the estimated 50,000 users of the website, about 20 (0.04%) FDR members had also disassociated from their families-of-origin, and that many parents chose not to speak to the media in an effort to avoid alienating their children further. The British Cult Information Centre (CIC) has described Freedomain Radio as a cult. A representative of the CIC said they were following FDR, and said that one sign of cults was that they cut people off from their families. Molyneux responded by saying, "If I advised a wife to leave an abusive husband, there would not be articles about how I am a cult leader"."

<p>
	Cult is not a binary. It's a matter of degree. There are dozens of factors that go into making a proper cult. One red flag does not a cult make.
</p>

<p>
	You could call it "cultish" if you want to be more accurate.
</p>

<p>
	I explain all this in my 2 part series, Cult Psychology.

			What a monopoly has to be is... monopolistic. I agree it doesn't need to be perfect but it still needs to be overwhelming in practice whenever the monopoly is challenged. Even as far as intent was concerned, one of these laws was the 2nd amendment which was explicitly aimed to prevent such a monopoly.

			A true federation has no monopoly of force. The EU for instance also has laws, courts, agencies and a legislature. It doesn't need overwhelming military force because members are allowed to secede.

			Please keep in mind that in the context of this thread I'm trying to argue the mainstream anarchist (or federalist) position and not the individualist position which I loathe. No doubt I'm doing a poor job of it, not being an anarchist myself. But I'm not trying to say you don't need a monopoly at some level but rather that the monopoly need not be in the hands of a state (which necessarily has little in the way of accountability to its subjects).

<p>
	These are some nuances which are beyond the scope of what I was talking about in the video.
</p>

<p>
	The more evolved a society gets the less it will need to rely on brute physical force to enforce its laws and rules. Most US laws do not require brute physical enforcement these days.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe in the far distant future there won't need to be a military at all. But not in our lifetimes so I don't really care about that.

	I think he should have just switched to an ads/sponsorship model. That would have been enough for him to thrive.

<p>
	He could also have created and sold some kind of digital product that would have been helpful to his viewers.

<p>
	Monetizing 1,000,000 subscribers is not so hard. The hard part is getting them in the first place, which is a serious accomplishment and success -- and I give him credit for doing that. That's really amazing for a philosophy channel.

			I think the first phase of the war belies quite eloquently the notion that the early USA had a monopoly of force over its territory. You talked about kings and so forth earlier but other non-monarchical polities in history had a similar makeup: common defense against outsiders but no monopoly of force internally.
		</p>

<p>
	A monopoly of force does not have to be perfect or absolute. Of course in the early days of the US things were somewhat loose. But still there were laws, courts, legislature, police, military, government agencies, etc.

	A) He has NO ADS! Of course he must e-beg. That's his revenue model by choice. Wikipedia does the same thing. They e-beg every December. As do all charities and non-profits. My mailbox gets full of charities begging me for donations every winter.

<p>
	I don't think you're actually try to see his situation from his POV. You are looking at it from within your own biases.

<p>
	No one is saying the customer is at fault. His viewers are free to support him or not. It's their choice and there's no problem with that. People will only donate to him if they feel his work is valuable.

<p>
	Not true at all. Monopoly of force was established from the very beginning. It was used to defend against foreign powers and conquer the Native Americans.
</p>

<p>
	The Civil War was simply a fracture in the monopoly and it only lasted for like 5 years.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The fundamental answer is: because when you see how horrific and ugly it is for long enough, you will want to end it.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever consciousness looks at its own selfishness and ugliness long enough, it awakens, has a change of heart, and drops the selfishness in favor or selflessness and love.
</p>

<p>
	Even if the North had not invaded the South. Eventually even the South itself would recognize that their slavery was too ugly and selfish to be sustained. It would have just taken a few hundred years longer.

<p>
	Yeah, that's how most libertarians argue because they are stage Orange, which tends to get comically "rational" when it is threatened. The entire stage Orange worldview is grounded in a religious-like faith in logic, without realizing that logic can be misused by the ego-mind to justify any sort of nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	Every deluded ideologue in the world feels that his worldview is logical. Case in point: Ben Shapiro.
</p>

<p>
	Logic cannot ever be trusted to understand the nuances of reality.

<p>
	I don't think he's a cult leader.
</p>

<p>
	As I said in my Cult Psychology - Part 2 video, there are many cult-like dynamics in society and online which do not make for a true cult. Although they are still problematic.
</p>

<p>
	People call me a cult leader all the time. It's all too easy to call someone whose worldview you disagree with a cult leader.

			I haven't seen Star Trek but this doesn't sound like the path we're on. For a little while during the collapse of the USSR it seemed (if you looked away from China and France) that the USA was gaining global supremacy but it has since lost ground and no other state and come anywhere near that amount of power since. Some of the supranationals (the UN, the EU and so forth) have grown pver the past decades but none has significant military force. They have a different kind of force which has grown more important over the decades. If a global state ever forms along those lines, it won't have a monopoly of force. And it won't need to.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Ah... okay, fair point.
</p>

<p>
	So what I mean is NOT that one nation will become so powerful as to physically dominate all the others into one global empire. No! That cannot happen because we are too developmentally evolved as a species for that.
</p>

<p>
	Global unification will happen along the lines of how the 13 colonies became the United States. There was no bloody war to force the colonies to unify. They did it peacefully and willingly.
</p>

<p>
	So what will happen is that all the countries of the world will start to unify through a natural desire to do so rather than through domination. It will so be obvious that having a unified world government will be a net gain for all parities who join as it will bring great cohesion and peace and prosperity.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is if there is an alien invasion. This will force nations to unify in self-defense. But I think most aliens are going to be far too conscious and selfless to invade us. An advanced alien species who can build fast ships will have to be extremely conscious and loving and shouldn't even has a desire to harm us.

	I was too uncharitable to call him "a hack". To be more precise, he's just ideologically stuck in a Blue/Orange worldview. That's really my only issue with him.

<p>
	I don't wish him any personal suffering. I don't see him as a fraud or charlatan. His heart is in the right place, it's just clouded by ideology.

<p>
	I see your question. Okay, yeah, in that case you need to factor in development psychology and the moral developmental line. Yes, as people become more educated and conscious thanks to the order and peace and technology afforded by the unification under monopoly of force, eventually they develop a higher sense of love and selflessness, which then leads to things like abolition of slavery, women's rights, civil rights, gay rights, police reform, etc.

<p>
	I don't see why you must call him a failed philosopher or insincere. You simply have a different worldview than his.

<p>
	His show was about as successful as you could expect it to be and it seems like he earned his success through hard work on his show. Why begrudge him for that?

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, just look at how it worked historically. The history books tell us what happened.
</p>

<p>
	Kings unified warring tribes. People accepted it because as bad as a king might be, warring tribes are worse. But once all the tribes are unified under one banner and culture for some centuries, people start to wonder why they need a king. Why can't they rule themselves as one unified nation? The king also usually becomes corrupt with power by this point. And so they stage a revolution to overthrow the king and put in place some kind of legislature and constitution which distributes the power to more than one person at the top. Voting rights are eventually established. Then voting rights get expanded to more and more ordinary people, not just aristocrats.
</p>

<p>
	Of course kings, aristocrats, and elites never give up their power willingly. They must be forced into to.
</p>

<p>
	Look at the police protests right now. The police are not willing to give up their power, but the mob of people is stronger than them and will take away some of the police's power because the police have been using their power recklessly.

	Find out what your top 2 love languages are and what her's are, and start using her love languages to give her the love she wants. And she will do the same for you.
</p>

<p>
	See book: The 5 Love Languages
</p>

<p>
	Both of you should read the book and discuss it.
</p>

<p>
	You are the man! You should be leading her towards what you want this relationship to be. If you want her to love you more, then it is your responsibility to communicate that to her and teach her how to love you.
</p>

<p>
	LEAD HER!

<p>
	Clarify what the fuck you want out of life, yourself, and her.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot lead until you are clear where you want to go.

<p>
	If you talk to 2000 girls, at least a few of them will turn really bad. The girl could be having a terrible day or she just gets spooked. She could be drunk. Her husband or boyfriend could get very defensive. etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty rare, but if you go out long enough, you will encounter even the most rare scenarios.

	Of course you do. That's your personal morality which you naively expect others to obey -- which they won't. Why should they? Violence is a relative notion. But you don't understand that.

<p>
	There cannot be peace without violence.
</p>

<p>
	The entire point of monopoly of force is that that is the only mechanism by which peace between humans is even remotely possible.

<p>
	The right to rule simply comes about when the ruler kills anyone who challenges his rule.

<p>
	That's the free market at work. In a free market I get to kill you if you don't follow my rules. And if you don't like it, tough shit, there is no higher authority you can appeal to. You can either be my slave or you can fight me.

<p>
	The biggest problem with debunking libertarians is anticipating their level of denial and foolishness.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to nail jello to the wall.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarian philosophy is so abstract and idealistic that it's very hard to debunk.

<p>
	BTW, the European refugee immigration issue is a legitimate one. You can certainly make a valid point that a society can only integrate so many people from less developed countries. But this point needs to be made very carefully, based on science, not based on nationalism and ethnocentrism. If you want to limit the number of immigrants to a country, that's a legit discussion we could have. You will need to provide some studies/proof which shows that your country cannot accommodate more immigrants.

<p>
	Nah... You can broadcast sexual intent early on. Just don't make it explicit. It's subtle.

<p>
	I often broadcast sexual intent with physical touch super early on. The way I touch her, she knows this isn't patty-cakes. Physical touch is HUGE!

<p>
	That's a deep topic. Like I said, you should be careful and responsible not to hurt girls too much. Obviously don't mislead them about your intentions.
</p>

<p>
	At a nightclub, one night stands are so common that the issue of a long-term relationship won't even come up in many cases since both of you know it was just a casual fling. But if you start seeing her repeatedly, yeah, she will start to expect a relationship, in which case you gotta be clear with her about what you want.
</p>

<p>
	I suggest you don't see a girl repeatedly unless you really like her and are willing to commit.

			What the line between that and being just a part of her entertainment of the night? Cause yeah sometimes they laugh even a lot but that doesn't mean that they are willing to sleep with you, they might just find you a funny guy, kind of like a dancing monkey. So how do you avoid that?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Easy. That's avoided with strong sexual intent and man-woman interaction. You need to be staring her down like a juicy piece of meat. She will feel that off you. This is not a friendly social conversation. She must feel within the first 2 minutes that if you get her alone in a room, you're going to fuck her. You need to broadcast sexual intent without ever saying anything sexual.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you could say within the first 2 minutes: "OMG, you are so yummy. I could bite into you like a juicy piece of watermelon." Then immediately switch to another topic without waiting for her response. After you say that, she will clearly know you aren't playing patty-cakes.
</p>

<p>
	But the best thing is just look her in the eyes like you want to fuck her. She will know. Nothing needs to be said.
</p>

<p>
	There are so many subtle ways to broadcast sexual intent.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with that one. It's a bit too edgy.
</p>

<p>
	Dial the edge down to a manageable point. You can say something like, "You are adorable like a little pig." It's a nice backhanded compliment because no girl wants to be called a pig. But if she gets offended you can always insist, "But baby pigs are so cute! Why do you hate piglets? Are you racist?"
</p>

<p>
	By that point you will have totally scrambled her mind. You can then switch to a serious topic.
</p>

<p>
	It's not lies per se. It's just being playful. DO NOT BE SERIOUS when talking to girls. Everything is a joke. Nothing matters. That's the proper attitude. You invest no emotional attachment in the interaction until she shows serious interest.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, making her laugh and making yourself laugh is the key. If you can make a girl laugh consistently she will get attracted to you very fast.
</p>

<p>
	A great way to go about this is to flip your love inside out.
</p>

<p>
	So, instead of saying "I love you", say "I hate you :)"
</p>

<p>
	"I hate you" is a great opener.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than saying, "will you marry me today?" it's much better to say, "I will never marry you. I will just use you and throw you away."
</p>

<p>
	Reserve psychology is amazing <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<p>
	I mean... you can make any line work in theory. But generally you don't want to come off as needy or desperate for love or sex.
</p>

<p>
	One time I slept with a girl after grabbing her while she was walking by and telling her, "I'm looking for a wife." She looked at me and said, "I'm looking for a husband." Bam! Instant green-light! 5 minutes later we were making out. 15 minutes later I pulled her to the hotel bathroom for sex but security kicked us out. 30 minutes later we were driving to her hotel room for sex.
</p>

<p>
	Again, what matters is not the words in your line, it's how your delivering it and how you follow up.
</p>

<p>
	You can open with almost any dumb line as long as it isn't instantly creepy or sexual.
</p>

<p>
	The dumbest openers work, like, "You will be my Pokemon." Usually the dumber you are, the more girls love it. Be dumb, but not creepy or sexual.
</p>

<p>
	How exactly does Penguinz0 imagine pickup works? You walk to up any random woman and she falls in love with you?
</p>

<p>
	In pickup you get blown out so much. Most of your sets go nowhere. But if you do 20 sets in a day, a few of them will hook hard. Getting blown out of sets is actually very important as it shows you're putting yourself on the line and it builds your confidence and ability to handle rejection.

It's an instant turn off for girls. It makes you look far too desperate and creepy.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, it's easy to record flashy and edgy pickup videos. But that does not equate to good game because in real life it's far too strong and scares the girls away. You want to be more chill and normal.
</p>

<p>
	Do not talk about sex with her unless she's already attracted to you and you're close to having sex with her. And even then you should avoid it since it's too explicit and will make her feel like a cheap slut. Guys love sexual humor, women usually don't.
</p>

<p>
	Licking ice cream off her ass? LOL
</p>

<p>
	Free head?? LOL
</p>

<p>
	You will after I cum on it? LOL. Cringe!

<title>Is The Latest Video About Libertarianism or Anarchism?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/51091-is-the-latest-video-about-libertarianism-or-anarchism/?do=findComment&amp;comment=660047</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	My examples were deliberately extreme to highlight the absurdity of people who argue for "freedom". But there is an enormous range of people who argue for it. Some people may be total anarchists while others might be pro military and even pro taxes, but still complain about things like regulation of car pollution or regulation of wild salmon fisheries in Alaska.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter what size gov you're okay with because all sizes of government are relative. So even if some libertarian says that he is okay with some federal government, all my points from the video still apply to him. Because he will still be arguing for deregulation on the grounds that bureaucracy infringes on his personal freedoms.
</p>

<p>
	A libertarian is one who complains about government regulation regardless of how big or small his government happens to be. He always feels oppressed and inconvenienced because he fundamentally doesn't understand the necessities of government.
</p>

<p>
	I should have made this more clear in the video, since libertarians who are somewhat okay with federal government will now use this as an excuse to ignore all my points -- which still all apply to them.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, dummy.
</p>

<p>
	Girls will never call a guy cute unless they are attracted.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to tell if she's attracted is by how attentive she is when you talk, how willing she is to follow your lead, and how willing she is to hold deep eye contact. If she's looking deep in your eyes, she's willing to sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	Also, if she's willing to let you touch her body, she's willing to sleep with you.

			Is there something that you don't like about RSD content on dating? Other than what you said about the community in your famous video

<p>
	It's overly selfish and emphasizes one night stands too much. It also tends to be highly misogynistic and needlessly cruel.
</p>

<p>
	I advocate an approach which is careful not to harm girls too much emotionally. You have to be careful and responsible about who you sleep with.

<p>
	No idea about dating in Afghanistan. I am talking about dating in developed countries.

			What about the naturalist style of pickup? Would you say this style is better than RSD?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	RSD is about becoming as natural as you can. The problem is how to become natural when you aren't one to begin with?
</p>

<p>
	True naturals tend to be highly extroverted, charismatic, social, confident, and experienced from a very young age. So you can't get that without doing thousand of clumsy approaches. Natural is the end result of years of nonstop effort and mastery. It will all feel highly unnatural when you start. Don't let that stop you. Naturalness comes with experience and skill.

Would it still take a few years to get good at this stuff?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, you will still require at least a year or two to get decent. There's more to it than mere confidence. You have to learn how to deal with all the obstacles that girls will throw in your face as you try to pull them home. You will lose hundreds of girls due to small mistakes you make. It's impossible to be born into life just knowing how to navigate all these obstacles. This is a skill that must be cultivated through practice and experience.
