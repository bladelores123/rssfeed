<title>Signs of US/Global recession</title>

<p>
	Remember, even if there is a recession, it's not necessarily a big deal. It might just be a few quarters of slowed growth.
</p>

<p>
	It's just too early to tell. People have a tendency to over-exaggerate things. After 10 years of non-stop growth a bit of recession is normal and not a problem. You can't expect never-ending growth.
</p>

			Does love dissolve all 'problems' when truly felt? Especially how deep the feeling of gods love goes. Seems like humans always are looking for a problem or reason for why they can't be loved. Love be like "that's okay" "I understand". The feeling of love just goes deeper and deeper. When there is no problem to solve, nothing to protect, nothing to do is what remains love?

<p>
	At the epic states of consciousness I've been in, problems cannot even be imagined. They simply make so sense.
</p>

<p>
	A problem is really a delusion.
</p>

<p>
	At such a level of consciousness I cannot even imagine my own death. Death literally becomes impossible. There is a point at which you are too conscious to die.

		</p>

		<p>
			So hate = love, love = hate, as the advanced individual they see both as the same thing because in non-duality everything is one. Does that mean they're basically blind to the fact that people fuck you over and deceive you, since hate and love are the same thing? Or are they instead hyper aware of spotting the bullshit in others but they come from a place of detachment and love? From what I would expect its most likely the latter, and I would say that they probably experience a heightened sense of empathy for those who are ignorant enough to do such a thing to others. Am I correct?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The more awake you are, the more aware you are of deception, the quicker you see through bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	The eye of God cuts through bullshit like a knife through butter.
</p>

<p>
	You will be able to smell devils from miles away.

<p>
	It can vary. You may feel nothing at all because you are in total acceptance of it. You don't necessarily need to feel some positive emotion. At other times you may weep for the tragedy of it.
</p>

<p>
	How you react to sitations will vary greatly and it depends on what mood you're in.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The only way God can hate is via a limited human vehicle.
</p>

<p>
	The pure Godhead cannot hate because it is totally conscious. Total consciousness accepts itself totally. It has no reason to hate anything because hate only arises from partiality and selfishness. You have to be deluded to hate yourself. It is impossible for Infnite Consciousness to be deluded. Unless it first becomes limited consciousness (a human).
</p>

<p>
	To experience hate, God had to invent humans. God experiences hate vicariously through your ego.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Is-ness = Love
</p>

<p>
	But this requires an insight to grok.
</p>

<p>
	It is not enough to only grok is-ness, you can probe deeper into what is-ness is.
</p>

<p>
	You can also notice that is-ness is Emptiness, or Intelligence, or Will. And all of these will be distinct insights. Just because you grok one does not mean you grok them all.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like tasting wine. You can taste it as a noob and only discern 1 or 2 qualities. Or you can taste it like a master and discern 5-10 qualities, even though it's all one wine.
</p>

<p>
	In the end what you're doing is discerning what consciousness is.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness = Truth = Love = Being = Isness = Will = Intelligence = God = Nothing = Infinity = Eternity = Now = Perfection = Goodness = Absolute = Nowhere = All = Oneness = Universe = Self = Divinity

</blockquote>

<p>
	Hard to say as there are probably multiple ways to get there.
</p>

<p>
	There certianly exist mystics who got it without psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	You need a very radical shift in consciousness according to my experience. I call it full God-mode. It's superhuman consciousness beyond anything I can meditate to. But then again, Love is right here right now, at all times. Once you grok it, it's so obvious you can hardly miss it. You don't need to feel love to know it's all around you.

<p>
	Not necessarily.
</p>

<p>
	I don't consider my heart totally open, whatever that even means.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - -

<p>
	Take some LSD and ask it, what is Love? Why make this so difficult? You can solve this whole headache in 30 minutes.

<title>Is Love the Key?</title>

</p>

<p>
	You are just preaching. You are not doing the work.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that your mind is fundamentally stuck on the belief that love cannot be real. And your ego is now busy justifying why you are right.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that you are not actually open to investigating consciousness and discovering whatever it happens to be. You are just rehashing your pre-existing prejudices via the words of others. You have no idea if any of the words you quote are true or false.
</p>

<p>
	This approach cannot work and is a bastardization of this work and a waste of our time.
</p>

<p>
	You do not know what Truth is. Start by admitting that to yourself. Enough games.
</p>

<p>
	He's a very complex thinker. Yeah, somewhere between Green & Yellow.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	It's both. Spirituality teaches you detachment. But you don't stop at detachment, you act from detachment with a sense of passion and purpose to improve the world.
</p>

<p>
	One of my core teachings is: You are a creator. Not just a creator, but THE Creator. You are God!
</p>

<p>
	God creates from a place of detachment. To be a powerful creator you must do it from a place of detachment.
</p>

<p>
	The point of life is not merely to awaken but to experiment with being a powerful Creator. The creation is not do out of need or lack, but out of Selfless Love. Creation is its own joy, point, and reward.
</p>

<p>
	This is a point which distinguishes my teaching from something like classic Buddhism, which is only concerned with awakening and escaping the dream. For me, the dream has value in that it allows for creation! This is God's sandbox! Create something cool which gives you joy and uplifts all living begins.
</p>

<p>
	Tolerating everything will make you a very powerful creator.
</p>

<title>Inanimate objects are conscious too</title>

<p>
	The distinction between inanimate objects and humans is imaginary. When the self fully collapses, it is impossible to distinguish yourself as a human from your carpet.
</p>

<p>
	THERE IS SUCH THING AS HUMANS! You're imagining it!
</p>

<p>
	When you understand this, this opens up interesting possibilities such as being a coffee table or a rock.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is a universal field. It does not belong to humans or even to creatures. Rather the universal field of consciousness imagines humans and creatures within itself. In the same way that you might carve a human body out of a block of ice. The ego/self is that carving out process which is constantly on-going. That is what we call survival. To survive as a self you must constantly keep chiseling the ice to maintain your identity. This you do by thinking and imaging yourself to be a real self. For this you use memories, stories, concepts, emotions, and a slew of defense mechanisms such as denial, projection, justification, self-bias, etc.
</p>

			In Norway the police are misusing theire power by taking your driving license if you even admit to smoke weed more than 2 times. You don't even have to be busted for it. We got this law which says that they can take the license from anyone they suspect don't have a sober enough lifestyle, and they themselves are the judge.. Doesn't matter if you haven't been near a car or not while high. If you tell your doctor you have used it, they are obligated to report you and you lose your license. This has started happening the last couple of years, used to be you just got a fine and that was it. I guess they have gotten more strict because there has been talk of decriminalisation and some people are very much against that. Some people thing its decriminalised here already, that is complete bullshit. They will make "decriminalisation" into forced medical supervision if you are caught with something.

			I kind of agree with you that sometimes you got to kill if pushed to the limits.
		</p>

		<p>
			What do you think about this?   How do you reconcile this difference? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can aim for that, but it is not possible in practice. Life cannot exist without death.
</p>

<p>
	This becomes especially problematic at the collective level. Even if you stop killing at the individual level, in collectives there will still be choices made which result in the loss of life.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, life is not only limited to human life. There is animal life, plant life, and even microscopic life.
</p>

<p>
	Your body has to kill bacteria by the thousands every day just for you to stay alive.

<p>
	This question of killing is a lot more complex than people think.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I don't recommend you kill humans. At an individual level you should be able to avoid it in decent parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
	But my point is, just because you avoid it doesn't mean you can now call others who do it evil. You must see why killing is necessary for some.
</p>

<p>
	As Neale said, nothing is good or bad.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	So I will no long bother explaining it to you. You must do the work. I spoil you with way too much explanation. It makes you weak and lazy.

<p>
	In the end, the only thing you will ever discover are deeper aspects of yourself. There is nothing but SELF here.
</p>

<p>
	But there are an enormous number of aspects of Self and degrees of comprehension of Self.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt that self-inquiry will be sufficient for most people to reach all those aspects and degrees.
</p>

<p>
	Healing and purifying the body & mind is important for most people I feel.
</p>

<p>
	Self-inquiry is great, but there is also more to this work than merely awakening.
</p>

<p>
	My approach to this work is extremely broad. Far broader than any orthodox teaching you'll find in Buddhism, Advaita, yoga, or any other school.
</p>

<p>
	Russia's a mix of Red, Blue, and even Orange.
</p>

<p>
	The reality of any country is far more complex than any one color. You have to consider specific regions, cities, peoples, and parts.
</p>

<p>
	The overall corruption problems, oligarchy, and Putin's totalitarianism is why I put it at Red.
</p>

<p>
	Culturally and religiously there is a lot of Blue. In the business sector there is some Orange but also lots of Red mafia style business.

<p>
	Randomness is actually pure noise.

	Noise is the opposite of information.

	Of course randomness/information is a duality imagined by the Infinite Consciousness.

But this physical world is not random.
</p>

<p>
	In a truly random world there would not be much interesting going on. Sure, God could imagine such a world, but so what? It's just one boring dream in the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	See, if you're a great writer, you don't write books of random letters. You could, but it's a waste of your time and genius. Maybe you do it once, but then you move on to greater things.
</p>

<p>
	You have the power right now to write a book of random letters. Ask yourself why you don't do it.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You can look around the room and love any object you notice. Or love the room as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really matter whether you do it or don't. The room is still made of Love.
</p>

<p>
	You can even hate the room.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to notice love or feel love for Love to be the substrate of everything. In the same way that you don't have to think about atoms or feel atoms for atoms to do their job. If you see an atom in a microscope, that's a bonus, but it doesn't really matter from the universe's perspective.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why you can deny Love, and it doesn't bother God one bit. The denial of Love is itself but one more instance of God's Love!
</p>

<p>
	It's all possible paths because time/space are imaginary.

<p>
	This novel is not just one tale. This novel includes every possible story that could ever be told. And again, these stories are not linear. They are co-written by an infinite number of authors.
</p>

<p>
	It is TOTALITY!

	Fair enough. I could have been a bit more technical in my discussion of suffering. Suffering is a deep topic.

<p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating yet just how relentless survival is. Survival dominates EVERYTHING in life. It's almost impossible to see beyond survival. Almost.
</p>

<p>
	I suggest to you that you do not deeply understand survival, and that should invest more time observing it and contemplating it in action.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, indeed, populism (aka, democracy) is a good thing. The problem is when right-wingers get a hold of populism. They turn it into ethnocentrism, a la the Nazis in WWII. Trump's populism is a fake populism because of course he doesn't give a shit about fixing systemic income inequality. He's using populism to create a culture war. This is a perversion of populism, which is supposed to be about increase democracy. But the culture war against the SJWs has blinded the right wing so much that they cannot see that democracy is being undermined. While the right wingers satisfy themselves on hating the SJWs, they overlook how the rich are just using this distraction to get richer. The right has misidentified the problem as globalist elite liberals, when in fact the problem is the systemic inequalities of the capitalism status quo. But right wingers cannot see this because they are traditionalists who blindly defend the status quo even if it harms their economic self-interest.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is the status quo needs to change. But conservatives, by their very nature, do not like change. They want to keep things as it was in "the good old days". But because society evolves we cannot ever go back to "the good old days", and they were never really good to begin with for many people. Conservatives create a fantasy/myth of the good old days and deny the reality of a rapidly evolving society. It's no accident that many conservatives deny evolution. They really don't like change. They want the safety of the past. But this cannot happen in an ever-globalizing world. We cannot go back to living as individual isolated nations. The world is too interconnected via technology & trade. The solution is to embrace change and take conscious control of it, rather than letting it unconsciously blindside us. What we need is proactive government, but we aren't getting it because conservatives have demonized proactive government as "big government", "communism", "government overreach", "world domination by liberal elites", etc.
</p>

<p>
	What we need is FDR style government that makes massive investments in domestic improvements and big picture coordination, similar to what we had for the space race. Government can do amazing things like moon landings if they are properly funded and given a clear vision. This requires good leadership.
</p>

<p>
	You will have to be proactive and take responsibility for making it practical. Academia is not known for their practicality.
</p>

<p>
	You need to have a vision for what you want to create, beyond just getting a degree. A degree means shit. What do you want to create for the world? That is the key question.

<p>
	I think psychology is pretty decent. Of course it's scientific. It's a science! People do serious research in that field and that's important.

<p>
	Of course it would be highly valuable to scientifically study & validate various yogic truths. We need a lot more scientific research into spirituality.

<title>Zizek On Trump</title>

<description><![CDATA[

People are free to define these terms however they want.
</p>

<p>
	I would say progressives are usually more left than liberals and progressives really care about making structural reforms to the system without too much concern for maintaining the old norms. One of those old norms is the dogma that capitalism is the only viable system and an absolute good.
</p>

<p>
	To me a progressive cares most about making serious changes to society to improve it. A progressive sees not making enough change as more dangerous than making too much change. Which is the polar opposite of a conservative. A progressive has a vision for how great society could be if we get our shit together and act big as a unit.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a good analysis of this issue:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/500i39m1RRE?feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	I consider Kim, Zizek, Bernie, Warren, and TYT progressives.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely not Joe Biden or Nancy Pelosi. They are centrists.
</p>

<p>
	Basically a progressive understands the inherent limitations and injustice of capitalism. Whereas everyone else is in denial about it.
</p>

<p>
	I consider myself a progressive, but I don't consider myself a socialist. I think there are some serious problems with socialism which socialists are in denial about as well.
</p>

His position is that he's very much against Neo-Liberal Third Way corporate Democrats such as Joe Biden, Hillary, etc. He wants serious progressivism / social democracy.

			In other words if it is for all intents and purposes an absolute that I have to follow some moral rules but morality itself is relative then by extension whether and if I have to follow any moral rules is also relative?

<p>
	Strictly speaking you do not need to follow any moral rules to awaken. Just like how you don't need to follow any rules to learn math. But if you are very wrapped up in acting from ego (being highly selfish) you will, in practice, not likely ever awake.
</p>

<p>
	So all that Buddhism is telling you is: stop being a fucking devil for a bit so you have a decent chance to awaken. Stop your whoring, theiving, and hoarding. Not because it is evil, but because it interferes with meditation.

<p>
	I have a BA in Philosophy.

<p>
	Overall I was quite disappointed with it. So I gave myself a PhD in God. That solved the problem.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Awakening is not normative. You are not obligated to awaken. Awakening is not better than not awakening.
</p>

<p>
	So yes, Trump will not awaken, but there is no one in the universe to say that is wrong. In fact God loves Trump just as much as the Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	It is us humans who judge Trump because it affects our survival and we are self-biased in that sense.
</p>

<p>
	So we can rightly kick Trump out of office, but that has nothing to do with him being bad in any absolute sense. It is a relative matter.

</p>

<p>
	A Masters or PhD in engineering is much more functional.
</p>

<p>
	Philosophy in particular is not meant to be studied in a university. This preverts the whole point of philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do serious philosophy, get yourself a bag of mushrooms and DMT and start doing yoga.

<p>
	Why? It will mostly be a waste of time. You can grow far better on your own and save the the money.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason for a masters or PhD is if you want to be university professor. It serves no other function and it certainly won't help you understand Truth.

	We are not going to be discussing extraction methods or creation methods on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that extraction and creation puts you into a whole nother category of legal problems. You will be treated as a drug dealer, not merely a recreational user. So do not go this route.
</p>

<p>
	If you are living with your parents you should not be doing this stuff at all. Be careful and don't fuck up your life.

<title>Legalizing Psychedelic Substances</title>

<p>
	This is an important topic.
</p>

<p>
	Medically, psychedelics like MDMA and mushrooms will soon be approved by the FDA for clinical use. This will happen within the next 5-10 years.
</p>

<p>
	Weed legalization is important toward the ultimate legalization of psychedelics, so we need more states legalizing recreational weed, and we really need a federal legalization of weed. This might happen within the next 5-15 years.
</p>

<p>
	And then we just need the most progressive states like California, Oregon, Washington, NY, etc. to start legalizing mushrooms & LSD. This should start to happen in the next 5-20 years.
</p>

			Buddhists on one hand claim that you have to follow certain ethical rules to become enlightened and to be seen as enlightened and his argument is that there is no reason for that to be the case if enlightenment is only a spiritual shift. His example with the pills is used to as an argument that there is such a thing as enlightenment without adhering to moral precepts.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not so simple.
</p>

<p>
	Adhering to moral precepts is part of the path. It's hard to reach satori if one is a devil. Hard, but not impossible. And it's hard to live in alignment with satori if one doesn't adhere to some moral precepts.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the moral precepts serve as training wheels.
</p>

<p>
	Even when doing psychedelics, your trips won't go very deep unless your mind is pure enough. Giving psychedelics to a guy like Donald Trump will not result in his realization of Buddha nature because his mind is too impure. First his actions would have to change. He'd have to stop lying, stealing, cheating, manipulating, etc. Or at the very least cut back on them.
</p>

<p>
	Of course enlightenment does not require adhering to anything. It is total liberation. But in practice you'll never reach it unless you make an effort to be less egotistical.
</p>

<p>
	A spiritual shift is also an ethical & moral shift.
</p>

<p>
	If you complain that people are devils after enlightenment, just try to imagine how big of devils they would have been without it.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is expecting some kind of perfect moral actions from people. This is not possible because morality is relative. Zizek likes to moralize without acknowledging that his moralizations are constructed by his own mind. If you are digusted by Nazis and Stalanists, it's not because they are inherently disgusting, it's because your mind is doing it out of survival drive. That is a self-bias Zizek's mind projects onto reality. Zizek seems to hold people like Nazi's as an absolute evil or wrong-doing, but that it is not Truth. That's not how a Nazi looks after satori.
</p>

<p>
	Perfection is not something one achieves through good moral actions. Perfection is already the case. All one needs to do is attain satori to see it.
</p>

			With plugging of a breakthrough dose, is there any chance of freaking out or yelling/screaming? I'd like to do it in my room, but have roommates. Don't want to alarm them with a major freakout. If it's just a gentle trip full of insight, I wouldn't worry about doing it at home.

<p>
	Of course this will depend on you.
</p>

<p>
	Some people love to yell. Personally I never feel the need to yell. For me it's too profound for yelling. Silence is golden.
</p>

<p>
	The best idea if you have roommates is to rent a cheap motel room for the trip. You can probably find a room for $40 on the outskirts of town.

<p>
	5-10mg is petty low dose.
</p>

<p>
	But if I had to guess, the SSRIs will probably block most of dose regardless.
</p>

<p>
	It's not a scam. You're just not following proper tripping protocol.
</p>

<p>
	You are lucky something worse didn't happen.

<p>
	This is definitely NOT how my trips look like at all.
</p>

<p>
	I think that is very dangerous and unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
	There is no need for water when tripping other than if you're thirsty, which you shouldn't be. Just drink a bit before your trip.
</p>

<p>
	The dose there is also too high. That kind of dose would traumatize many people.
</p>

<p>
	You can achieve massive breakthroughs in a safe & gentle way through plugging.

<p>
	It's both, since infinite/finite is a duality. Depends on what state of consciousness you're in.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you think is finite is actually infinite at a high enough degree of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There is the human mind, and then there is Universal Mind. The human mind is just a partial form of Universal Mind, the way a finger is part of a hand. When mind becomes Universal Mind, everything becomes knowable.

		</p>

		<p>
			He says that consciousness is dependent on the body and ends with it, as opposed to Nothingness which exists regardless as the formless, underlying foundation to the world of form, but ultimately one with form.
		</p>

		<p>
			He says: "Some readers may be wondering why I say that Awareness is not the Absolute(...). If pressed as to whether or not consciousness is the Absolute, I would say, that, Mind is not Mind , yet neither is it no-mind. (...) In Nothingness, there is some degree of awareness present -it is not how most people imagine brain death- albeit unconditioned, object- and subjectless. The Consciousness (for lack of better word) of Non-Being is so subtle that the moment we try to reflect upon it to check if we are conscious, we are jarred back into 'bein' and into our ordinary dualistic consciousness. I hesitate even to call this experience 'pure subjectivity' as that invites a metaphysical position that I am not willing to support.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's right, God is Nothingness, and Consciousness is Nothingness too.
</p>

<p>
	The word consciousness is tricky. People use it in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	The way I teach, consciousness is the only thing there is. But the consciousness I speak of is not produced by any human brain or body. And it does not end.

	Your skepticism should be as big as your willingness to dig up the truth.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with you skeptics is that you love to talk a lot but do no research.
</p>

<p>
	Go read every book & article ever written on development psychology until your skepticism is satisfied.

<p>
	Just because you're in some state of no-mind or absorption doesn't mean you have insight into reality.
</p>

<p>
	Meditative states are not good enough here. You have to want insight. Which requiring questioning.
</p>

<p>
	You can bliss out in meditation all you want, but it doesn't mean you understand what's going on and why.
