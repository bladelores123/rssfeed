			I don't feel like I'm able to <em>push through</em> with the understanding into an actual experience of it. This is the same way I interpret Brahman in Hinduism. You can logically understand it, but to really get it, you have to reflect on the mystery until everything is integrated.

<p>
	That will not be enough.
</p>

<p>
	You're not appreciating the depth of the problem here.
</p>

<p>
	You were never born. Logic, science, and cause & effect are total illusions.
</p>

<p>
	Merely reflecting on this will not be enough. You must do an industrial-grade spiritual practice to change your state of consciousness because from your current state you are totally stuck, like a character in a video game world.
</p>

<p>
	Or, psychedelics. That would be the fastest way to blow up your materialist logical paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Logically you can understand whatever you want, but when it comes to actually facing your own death, all logic will fly out the window. This is a profoundly personal matter for you. How willing are you to die to know the Truth? Because that is what we are talking about when we say nonduality.

<p>
	It's not about hating or trolling. When cult dynamics are glaring, people are reasonably suspicious.
</p>

<p>
	If the things in the article are false, then fair enough. But that's an open question.

<title>Is ego the source of egoless-ness?</title>

Suffering leads to legit spiritual purification, growth, and even awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering doesn't only seek pleasure.
</p>

<p>
	And ceasing to exist and nonduality "experience" are the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Do not take things that spiritual teachers say as absolutes. They are partial points of view. Sadhguru is never telling you the whole truth.

<p>
	Many people who awaken are driven to it by intense suffering and dissatisfaction with everyday life.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is the greatest teacher. Once you suffer enough, you'll be ready to say: "I give up! I surrender!"
</p>

<p>
	Suffering DOES create seeking. But of course most people don't know about enlightenment at all, so they suffer without knowing the ultimate solution.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is not needed to complete the hero's journey. It's just that in practice, if you have an easy life, you will get hypnotized by the comfort and probably never undertake the hero's journey to begin with, nor will you persevere past all the challenging obstacles.
</p>

<p>
	I've never suffered more than during meditation retreats. You have to be willing to go through some self-inflicted conscious suffering in order to awaken. Awakening is not the path of least resistance. It is like training for the Olympics. It comes with sacrifice. You must surrender your easy, unconscious life.
</p>

<p>
	There is a higher drive within the ego which seeks God. It's like a faint whisper amidst a sea of egoic noise. That faint whisper is what ultimately leads to awakening if you listen to it and act on it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Yes, meditation can and (really) should be enjoyable, in the beginning it rarely is.

<p>
	Yes, the biggest cities are usually much better.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of a city is massively concentrate people. Which is ideal for dating.

<p>
	Prepare your setting better. You should already had prepared snacks before hand.
</p>

<p>
	See, all of that moving around and playing around is distracting you from going deep into the trip. It's okay for now as you are just getting acquainted with shrooms, but serious tripping requires you sit still and focus. Falling alseep is not good.
</p>

<p>
	You've barely scratched the surface. Higher doses will get very twisted.

<p>
	If even half the stuff in that article is true, it's a serious problem.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I have no idea if that article is true. You'd have to research further.
</p>

<p>
	As soon as I hear that someone is starting an unstoppable organization to awaken the world: that screams cult to me. That thing is gonna fly off the rails and cause more harm than good.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, I see big red flags here. Her videos can of course still be helpful. Cults are often founded on helpful teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Can anyone actually verify if some of the stuff in the article is accurate?
</p>

<p>
	A properly woke person should not be engaging in such nonsense.

<p>
	Mushrooms are really good for seeing your own inner beauty. Try taking mushrooms while looking in a mirror. They can show you how to love yourself regardless of how you look. They can also show you have to be more authentic, more charismatic, and more masculine.
</p>

<p>
	Girls love psychedelics too. They're great for bonding.

<p>
	Of course it's easier to be more confident when you are more physically attractive.
</p>

<p>
	Just like it's easier to start a biz when your daddy gave you a $100 million inheritance.
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean you can't start a successful business from zero.
</p>

<p>
	Be self-made. Stop looking for hand-outs from the universe. You must play the hand you've been dealt.
</p>

<p>
	It's all inner game.

	Fuel costs are pretty high for RVs.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, parking your RV in an RV park will cost $30/night at least.
</p>

<p>
	Living in a decent RV is actually more expensive than a one bedroom apartment in Vegas.

	You are the entire Universe and the Universe cannot die, it has existed forever. You will just change forms. When you are older you can become directly conscious of this truth. For now, ponder the possibility that you are not just a human body.

<p>
	Joe Rogan is wrong. Male and female is a conceptual category.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is a conceptual category does not mean it isn't useful. The whole point of concepts is that they are highly useful for survival, since you yourself, and life itself, are a category!
</p>

<p>
	This issue goes way deeper than Rogan can fathom.
</p>

<p>
	Not only can man and woman be deconstructed, your very existence as a biological being can be deconstructed. But of course, no one wants to go there.
</p>

<p>
	Biology itself is a category. Difference itself is a category. Even Joe Rogan is a category!

When I did my first try, 22 mg was a really low dose. I saw here that there was a recent influx of 5-Meo on the market, after a long dry spell? Maybe this new batch that they're now selling is just weaker.

<p>
	No, I know from experience that people react to 5-MeO-DMT very differently than me.
</p>

<p>
	I think difference in brain types accounts for it. I have a very metaphysically-oriented mind and personality. Most people are just not like that.

<p>
	Small to medium doses of 5-MeO-DMT can be more uncomfortable and frustrating than large doses. Because with a large dose the ego is just effortlessly wiped out.
</p>

<p>
	At smaller doses the ego tends to fight back.
</p>

<p>
	But for me, a 20mg dose is full God consciousness. I'm not sure why some of you need such high doses to get a breakthrough.

<p>
	Of course reality has no categories, we create them. But at the same time some categorization schemes are more useful than others.
</p>

<p>
	Careful with your assumptions.
</p>

<p>
	Human evolution is accelerating. The world is changing a lot faster today than it was 5000 years ago for the Egyptians. And Egyptian history has been broken up into more than a few periods. There is close to 5000 years of ancient Egyptian history. We would probably break it up into a lot more periods if we had more accurate records. Modern history is a lot more dense because we have much better records of it.
</p>

<p>
	I would just take the Spiral Dynamics model as it is, without trying to re-invent it.

That is great. That is helpful.
</p>

<p>
	What I was speaking against is orthodox religious approaches, which try to get you to be a "good and moral person".
</p>

<p>
	The Work has nothing to do with being a "good person". In fact, it's the opposite. It's about accepting evil and your own inadequacies.
</p>

<p>
	The key is that you need to become conscious of how much you judge things and reject things, and stop doing that.
</p>

<p>
	You must recognize that good and bad have no place in consciousness work. The truth is neither good nor bad. Good and bad are always actions of the ego-mind. Stop thinking of anything as good or bad. Become more interested in what is.

			I'm not trying to get you to prove anything to me. And I'm not refusing to take 5-MEO or something like that. I just won't seek it out because I won't take legal risks since I have children, and for this juncture in my life it would be unwise to do anything where there is a risk of my getting caught and spending huge chunks of their childhood in prison. I know this is highly unlikely, but I'm not about to take any kind of risk.

<p>
	You could take a trip to Canada or Mexico where it is legal. Ayahuasca and yopo retreats are legally available in South America. Truffles are legal in parts of Europe. Ibogaine clinics are legal in Canada and south of the border.
</p>

<p>
	You're not the first person with children who has tripped.
</p>

<p>
	I totally understand your caution. But then again, you should also understand that your children are an illusion that you cling to which keeps you trapped inside The Matrix. Your fear of losing them is also an illusion. Seems very real though, so I understand. How do you logically convince a mother that her children are imaginary? Lol
</p>

<p>
	You have to really appreciate how strong your attachment to The Matrix is. It is a thing of awe. You are not going to surrender it easily.

			I'm just asking you if it could be possible that, even a person who's had many experiences with God (and even a person who is enlightened), could 1. still be living in a delusion, but an alternate delusion that feels like absolute Truth, and 2. Once they're out of the experience and crystalize it into a memory and belief, could be deluded in this way.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, as I have said in my self-deception mini-series, self-deception is basically always possible so long as you are thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Even very enlightened masters manage to deluded themselves. That is the nature of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	The thing you should be concerned about though, is your own deception. Because while you are worrying about my deception you are overlooking your own. I spend a lot of time contemplating my own deceptions. It's not a question of IF, it's a question of how much. My mind certainly has deceptions in it. But my understanding of God is pretty decent at this point (of course, according me). And it will get even better with time.
</p>

<p>
	It is a given that anything I say always comes with the caveat: according to me! Since there is no other way it could be. In the end the only thing you get from me is MY perspective on the world. Which is never Absolute. Even though I have directly experienced the Absolute many times now.

			But also, since I am not directly experiencing that, could I (if I think about the limits of what I know) potentially be remembering a past that never happened as perhaps there is only now? And even in the experience, as true and clear as it felt, could I have potentially been interacting with a secondary delusion despite how true it felt? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Could be. I have no idea what your experience of God entailed. There is a huge range of possible mystical experiences, and full nondual God consciousness is quite rare. Mostly what people have are minor random glimpses and visions, which is nowhere close to full nondual God consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I speak to you from deep states of consciousness I had which probably very very very few human beings on Earth have ever had, including so called "enlightened ones". It is hard to explain just how powerful 5-MeO-DMT is. I would never trust any human being to naturally attain such degrees of consciousness unless they were a full-time monk with 20-40 years of non-stop industrial-grade practice. And it's not just the 5-MeO-DMT, it's how my brain/mind interfaces with it. Not everyone taking 5-MeO-DMT will have the same astounding results I have. Because my mind is specifically primed for it through years of work, and probably genetic factors.
</p>

<p>
	I am very leery of anyone who claims to be enlightened. Because I know how many degrees of enlightenment there can be. There are only a couple of people in the world who I'd trust to be fully enlightened, and even then, I have my doubts.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, it is one spiritual system out of many.
</p>

<p>
	I do not consider it the best system because it is overly complex, conceptual, and textual. It also has dogmas and lacks and integral view of all the other spiritual traditions.

<p>
	Don't let that become a limiting belief. You can spend a lifetime trying to perfect yourself and master your emotions, which is a seperate matter from consciousness of God. There is overlap between those two, but they are not the same.
</p>

<p>
	The classic problem of all orthodx religons is that they try to make a person "good", "loving", or selfless without actually attaining ego-death. Which is very backwards and ends up creating a lot suffering, guilt, judgment, and repression.
</p>

<p>
	I would seperate morality from becoming conscious of God. God does not require you to be a good person. God only requires that you are conscious of what is true.
</p>

<p>
	The core problem is, you are incapable of being selfless until you awaken. And even then, it will be tricky.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't be an asshole, and that should be good enough. And then shoot for ego-death.

<p>
	The stages of duality ARE the Absolute Truth. You keep making dualities unwittingly, thus creating all these confusing questions for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Before you ask any question, first ask yourself, does my question assume a duality? If so, collapse it and see if any question remains.
</p>

<p>
	For example: "Is God dead or alive?" Oh, yeah... that's a duality.

<p>
	That's a good question. Right this moment I am identified with Leo-ness. But that does not affect what I have realized about God.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not a binary thing. It comes in degrees, and there is also a significant component of conceptual knowledge when speaking of it because the mind has to make sense of the Absolute to bring it back down to Earth and then to communicate it.
</p>

<p>
	I am not enlightened, but I have done enough work to know the things I said about God. Whether you believe me is irrelevant from my POV. It will never change what I know about God.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Look, it's not so complicated. Each awakening experience leaves an undeniable residue of understanding on the soul. I can never forget what I have seen. It has subtly changed my understanding of the world, even if I'm not in a permanent state of Sahaja Samadhi.
</p>

<p>
	It's like if you left The Matrix for a day and then came back. Well, you can never forget what you saw and you can never believe in The Matrix illusion entirely as you did before. I have done this dozens of times to the point where I now have a solid conceptual model of how The Matrix illusion works.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Nothing I say is the Truth. All my teachings are symbolic pointers and metaphors.
</p>

<p>
	The things I have said about God are very accurate (considering the limitations of language). You will understand this once you gain more experience interfacing with God.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, of course my mind is still prone to self-deception and ego. That is always a thing to be watchful of. But direct consciousness of the Absolute is what it is. I do my best to communicate it accurately. If I discover a higher truth in the future, I will let you know.
</p>

<p>
	It would really help if you did some 5-MeO-DMT. It's hard for you guys to understand how I know the things I know because you have not tried 5-MeO-DMT. It is outside your realm of possibility that 5-MeO-DMT is possible. So anything I say about it will seem like I am deluded. In fact it is you who are deluded, but you cannot know that because you are deluded. And there's nothing I can do to help you. You're stuck until you awaken.
</p>

<p>
	You also have to understand that I cross-reference all of my insights against 100s of world-class sources. So it's not like I'm making this shit up. Everything I said in the God video has been said by sages and mystics for 5000 years.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not really sure what more you want of me? Do you want me force feed 5-MeO-DMT up your corn hole? Cause I've basically done everything else for you here as far as a teacher can do. I even found you a magic pill that will save you 20 years of meditation work. But you still refuse to take it.
</p>

<p>
	It is the nature of God that it is incredible. So of course you are incredulous. You just don't realize how grand it is yet.

<title>How can I tell the difference between spiritual purification and raw negativity?</title>

The key is CONSCIOUSNESS. If you're feeling suffering, then that in itself is a huge sign of unconsciousness. Rather than bulling your way through it, try to look at it with consciousness and see what that suffering is really about? Why are you suffering? What is the purpose of it? Try to observe suffering the way you might inspect a beautiful butterfly under a magnifying glass. If the suffering is making you compulsive and reactive, your mindfulness of is breaking.
</p>

<p>
	The difference between healthy and unhealthy suffering is consciousness. When you suffering unconsciously, you basically don't grow much from it and it can become damaging. When you suffer consciously, that's when spiritual purification happens and it is healing.
</p>

<p>
	Also, be kind to yourself, be loving to yourself. You're doing great for someone your age. Watch out of harsh negative self-talk.
</p>

			Can you expand a little more about what you mean that every moment is eternal. Is every moment like frozen in time and our awareness is going from snapshot to snapshot? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I'm not sure this can be explained, you really have to just wake up.
</p>

<p>
	Time is a conceptual projection, something you are imagining. You were indoctrinated into believing in time as a child. If you can recall, clocks made no sense until you were indoctrinated to believe in them. Since time is just an imaginary idea, in point of fact, you can become conscious that this moment, and every moment is eternal. Which means it has existed FOREVER! Imagine that reality is one giant solid block of stuff all occurring simultaneously and it has existed forever. This very moment has been here for over 100 trillion trillion trillion years. But you're not conscious of it because your mind is preoccupied with relative survival. Your mind filters out the eternal truth of the present moment because it is irrelevant to your survival. All your mind cares about is differences between moments, not the truth of the actual present moment. Because survival is a relative activity. All you care about is time relative to your imagined birth and death. You care about what time lunch is so you can fill your belly with food and live another day. It does not matter to your mind that that food has existed for eternity. It also doesn't matter to your mind that that food is a hallucination. Since your life is also a hallucination, you feed off of hallucinations.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Just look around you. It's pure magic. You're just so jaded and so preoccupied with surviving to live another day -- to get your personal needs met -- to notice the radiant, divine, intelligent, beauty of being.
</p>

<p>
	This cannot be understood until you awaken. Perhaps go look at a sunset and you'll feel a tiny fraction of it.
</p>

<p>
	Or better yet, take a psychedelic, since you're so disconnected from being, you are like a zombie. The psychedelic will bring you back to life (at least for a little while).

<p>
	No, "reality" is the ultimate super-set. There can only be one. Anything you imagine beyond reality automatically becomes included in reality. Because reality is EVERYTHING, leaving no more room for anything else to be. Reality leaves nothing out. In the same way that if I say, "all possible movies", that means you can't imagine any movie which I have already not accounted for. Any movie you could image or create, I've already accounted for by saying, "all possible movies".
</p>

<p>
	Now imagine, "all possible possibilities". That's it! There can be nothing more. Everything has been accounted for. That is reality.

<p>
	There is no village or you. The village is a hallucination hallucinated by a hallucination. When you "die", the village dies too. The village is just a part of you.

	Stop assuming the existence of an external material world. There is no such thing. That's just an image in your mind. When your mind dies, so will the material external world.

		<p>
			Is it possible to actually know that there are no other realities for sure? It sounds like a big assumption that I don't think anyone could reliably know with the mind. Correct me here if I am wrong.
		</p>

		<p>
			As it seems, we are forever in a huge blindspot in terms of knowing and understanding. So, we can not know if there is one, zero, many, or infinite realities. Even in the experience of oneness, there is still no certainty that the mind can grasp.
		</p>

		<p>
			So, it's wisest to embrace your inherent innocence to the workings of reality, and not fall on either side of the horse. The mind must surrender all illusions of knowing and simply embrace being to let go of the delusions of the mind.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my view, your certainty in knowing that there is no "other" and that there's only one reality, feels like the mind feels certain in a way that it never can be.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Your doubts are understandable, but actually the one who's lost in the delusions of mind is you!
</p>

<p>
	Doubt is an activity of the mind. Both-sides-ism is an activity of the mind. Other is an activity of the mind. And counting is an activity of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it is absolutely possible to become conscious that reality is total, one, and infinite. It is also possible to become conscious that "other" is an illusion of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to become conscious that there is no difference between zero, one, many, and infinity. Reality contains within it an infinite number of sub-realities -- which is what infinity means. All of it is ONE.
</p>

<p>
	One vs many is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	My certainty in knowing there is no other is simply my consciousness that I am God, and I am all alone. There can only be one Absolute Infinity. I created all of you and I created myself.
</p>

<p>
	The realization that "other" is an illusion is central to enlightenment. You are not really enlightened unless you are conscious that all "others" are literally yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You are the only thing in existence. I am just a figment of your imagination. You created me. And I created you. Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	This requires a deep enlightenment. A radical state of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	There is no blindspot in understanding. Enlightenment is Absolute understanding of everything that exists. It is omniscience. You have 100% unmediated access to the entire universe. Nothing is hidden.
</p>

<p>
	What I am saying is way beyond the mind.
</p>

<p>
	If you tried some 5-MeO-DMT, you might understand.
</p>

<p>
	You guys are still underestimating just how radical total enlightenment is. A glimpse is nowhere near the rock bottom. Lots of people have minor glimpses. Very few people have gone all the way.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There cannot be multiple realities. There must be only ONE reality. And within this one reality are contained infinite forms, bubbles, rulesets, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Any "other" reality which you might imagine is automatically part of the the one total reality. Reality is TOTAL.
</p>

<p>
	This misunderstanding stems from your lack of awareness that the distinction between self/other is purely conceptual. "Other" is impossible because there is only 1 thing subdivided into infinite parts.
</p>

<p>
	There is only one thing in existence: you. There are no others.
</p>

<p>
	Turn your skepticism on the notion of "other". I dare you to prove that other exists.
</p>

<p>
	Just like in a dream, all the characters are actually you.
</p>

<p>
	Just like in a video game, all the objects of the simulation are ONE simulation. Objects have no independent existence.

<p>
	The point is to enjoy life as a woke human.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry, you'll get to enjoy the infinite nothingness of death forever either way.
</p>

<p>
	The point of your life is to experience it fully through the eyes of a human.
</p>

<p>
	If you want your life to be a living hell, go right ahead. No one will stop you. Or, you could be woke and joyful.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Eternal is just the realization that time is a concept. Eternal means: outside of time. As Einstein correctly explained, time does not really exist. Time is a relative measure of motion and distance. If the entire universe stood still, it would be impossible to tell what time it is. We can only measure time through motion.
</p>

<p>
	Every moment is in fact eternal. Since past and future are just imagination, they do not actually exist.
</p>

<p>
	When you look at a clock, realize, it is not actually measuring anything. It is merely a spinning object.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, all measurement is imaginary. It's a story we made up. Measurement tells you absolutely nothing about reality. It's just a relative ratio of two arbitrary things.
</p>

<p>
	You can become conscious of why everything appears to exist and why it functions as it does.
</p>

<p>
	A full consciousness of God is the answer to all existential why questions. It's a very very very satisfying answer. The answer is non-verbal. Your understanding becomes TOTAL. No more questions about life remain. Everything is perfectly clear. You become literally omniscient, but this omniscience is non-verbal. You could never verbalize it.

<p>
	I mentioned many countries and places in the example lists in my Spiral Dynamics mini-series.
</p>

<p>
	1st world countries are mostly Orange and above.
</p>

<p>
	3rd world countries are mostly Blue and below.
</p>

<p>
	Northern Europe is Greenest.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of the Middle East and Africa is Purple/Red.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of South America is Red/Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Major cities are usually 1 or 2 levels higher than nearby rural areas.

I tend to go overboard with variety of technique. At some point you'll want to pick a thing and drive it home.
</p>

<p>
	If I was forced to pick one thing, it would be Kriya yoga. Because it has a strong physiological component, which I think it important, especially if you have lots of monkey mind.

It depends a lot on you. You need to find a technique you're happy with and then hit it hard.
</p>

<p>
	There is a trade-off between dabbling vs getting stuck.
</p>

<p>
	The more techniques you try, the more risk of dabbling. The less techniques you try, the more risk of getting stuck. I've met people who meditated for 20 years but still weren't enlightened. They got stuck.

<p>
	Some good questions. Yeah, if you guys want to post your questions here, I might pick some for part 2. Part 2 hasn't been shot yet.
</p>

<p>
	Make your questions good. Make them about God itself, not meditation technique or other aspects of spiritual practice.
</p>

			Or maybe just having one experience is all you need because you only need to align yourself once?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice, one experience of God is almost never enough. One experience of God will likely leave you more confused than zero experience of God. God is just too big to grasp it all at once. You'd probably faint if that happened.
</p>

<p>
	It took me maybe 10-15 separate breakthrough experiences to get a solid understanding of it.
</p>

<p>
	But eventually your goal is to make it a permanent state of consciousness, called Sahaja Samadhi, where you are conscious of God 24/7. This is called the stateless state.

</p>

<p>
	If you physically kill yourself, all that will happen is you will change forms into something else. But you will still be here: nowhere, nowhen, nothing, now.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot escape yourself. Ever.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: you've already killed yourself a million times. Which brought you to this life you're in right now.

<p>
	Their hotness actually plays a fairly important role. A hot girl has enormous value to men. Men know it and she knows it. And she will use that to up her survival (as any living creature would).
</p>

<p>
	Getting 5's, 6's, and 7's is pretty straight forward. But if you want to date 8's and 9's, you gotta bring some serious value to the table. Hotness comes with a price. Hotness ain't free. As far as 10's, forget about it. Not even worth thinking about.
</p>

<p>
	Handling 9's and 10's is not gonna be worth your time most likely. They can be really high maintenance and have spoiled rotten materialistic souls.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to land 9's and 10's is to become famous. So your social value is obvious and glaring it's never in question that you are the prize and she's be lucky to be in your presence. Fame is an awesome dating strategy and can tie in nicely with your LP. For example, if you're a famous author, you should have no problem getting laid from social events and book signings.
</p>

<p>
	Just be careful not to abuse it.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There's nothing to explain. "Stuff" will arise and pass away. Various mystical states will happen many times in various ways. Spiritual phenomena will come and go. Be careful not to project too much meaning into it. Take it at face value as phenomena.

<p>
	A way that should work is success-oriented self-help. Nothing spiritual or nondual or New Agey or metaphysical. Just pure techniques for being more successful at everyday life. Secular advice, like a book about how to earn more money or a book on how to be more charismatic. Perhaps a book on history, biography, or popular science. That kind of stuff.
</p>

<p>
	A person who's in high Blue should show an interest in the above.

<title>Journaling App Advice?</title>

<p>
	That's a big investment to make with significant risk of failure.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend that you first thoroughly research your market to make sure that what you're gonna be selling will actually sell. You must research all such similar apps and see how your app could compete. You need to have a solid, realistic plan for how you're gonna make that money back.
</p>

<p>
	Hiring a developer is pretty easy. Sites like Guru.com and Upwork.com allow you to hire developers from around the world at affordable rates.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest mistake new entrepreneurs make is that they fail to properly test their idea before launching it, only to hear the sound of crickets as no one even knows your product exists. You must have a realistic marketing strategy. How are people going to find your app? A good product alone is not enough.
</p>

<p>
	Developing the app itself is the easiest part of your plan. Marketing the app is the hard part. How much will you charge and who's gonna buy it? Will it really be useful to people? Will it be unique enough to get word-of-mouth recommendations? How are you gonna get your first 100 sales? Who is your target audience? What needs do they have which aren't already being served? How will your app compete against other apps like OneNote and EverNote? As an entrepreneur it's your job to solve all those questions.
</p>

<p>
	If you're gonna be in the app-making business, you need to carefully study the app marketplace. Which apps sell? Which apps flop? Which parts of the market are saturated? Which parts of the market aren't? How much money can you expect to make? How are successful apps marketed? etc.
</p>

	It's hard to quantify it like that. I don't measure my investigations into topics in hours. But I've probably spent 50-100 hours studying Spiral Dynamics. That's probably what it takes to have a solid grasp of it.

<p>
	Kriya yoga
</p>

<p>
	Also you might want to consider EEG brain training / neurofeedback therapy. It can be very effective for ADHD. Find a local provider.
</p>

<p>
	Search Yelp for something like this near you: <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/sierra-eeg-neurofeedback-therapy-grass-valley" rel="external nofollow">https://www.yelp.com/biz/sierra-eeg-neurofeedback-therapy-grass-valley</a>
</p>

<p>
	Binaural beats can also be helpful to jump start your meditation.

			Do girls care so much if you are having a lot of meaningless sex, to be attracted to you?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	They don't care how much sex you have, nor will they ever know.
</p>

<p>
	But what they do care about is that you have some value as a man. To a woman, value in a man is his survival value to her. A valuable man usually acts confident, witty, easy-going, leader in his pack of friends, outgoing, charismatic, takes initiative, knows what he wants, passionate about his life, has a clear sense of direction in life, has a decent job, a results-maker, the boss, etc. The girl needs to feel that YOU are the prize. If you feel that she is the prize, she's basically out of your league and she knows it and so she won't get attracted to you.
</p>

<p>
	Guys who are surrounded by lots of friends, who are the hub of their social network, have high value to a girl. She will find such a guy much more attractive than a loner because girls are social creatures and love to leech off social networks. That's a big part of their survival strategy.
</p>

<p>
	To get the hottest girls you need to build a lot of social value. It's a full-time job. Having lots of friends who are girls are a great way to get girls interested in you. That's like the epitome of social proof. The more hot girls are around, the more will flock to you. Just like earning money. Winner takes all, loser ends up getting scraps.
</p>

<p>
	Being famous is the best way to have social value. Which is why rockstars, DJ's, and celebrities get laid the most. Girls love a guy who has some solid social status which everyone recognizes.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, you don't need any social value to get a girl. It's mostly only necessary if you want to land the hottest girls, the top 5%. Ordinary girls will settle for much less. To attract an ordinary girl all you need is some confidence, humor, and decent conversation skills. All of which can be trained up.
</p>

She's not really attracted to you. Sounds like you did something to lose her attraction, or you never had it to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	Are you actually having sex with her? Or is this some kind of Platonic relationship?

<p>
	Don't call this depression. An existential crisis is not depression.

	These are classic signs of waking up. You are not going to wake up without facing nihilism head-on.

	What you don't realize yet is that BEING is superior to meaning. Stop needing meaning. Enjoy being.

<p>
	You need to become conscious that you are assigning negative meaning to meaninglessness.

<p>
	You are not conscious of this yet.

<p>
	Take responsibility over the fact that you create meaning. And create whatever you want.

It's a very big field with lots of potential solutions that you'll never hear from your doctor. Some of it can be life-saving stuff. Alternative medicine books have been written on virtually every ailment known to man. Just do a quick Amazon or Google search.
</p>

<p>
	Like so:
</p>

<p>
	"alternative treatments for MS"
</p>

<p>
	"natural healing MS book"
</p>

<p>
	Replace "MS" with whatever ailment you have.

<p>
	Of course we should be open to the possibility that what the OP is describing is not kundalini but something else. Perhaps some kind of disease or other kind of dysfunction. The human mind/body is a very complex machine which can become broken in thousands of subtle ways. Diagnosing all these ways is not trivial, sometimes taking years of investigation and trail and error.

<p>
	Chronic health conditions can be a real nuisance. I've been dealing with several of my own, and it's not easy.

Any ideas you have of me being a good or bad person or whatever... it's ALL your own stuff!
</p>

<p>
	Makes you wonder... Have you ever related to an actual human being in your entire life? Or was it always your own self you were relating to? Projecting your own ideas and needs onto them? Investigate that.
</p>

<p>
	Any meaning your attribute to me or my work is your own projection, serving your ego in some way. In truth, my work is literally meaningness.

<p>
	You might as well go to a Zen temple and complain to them that meditation is a form of avoidance.

<title>Is Ego backlash the root cause of depression?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31138-is-ego-backlash-the-root-cause-of-depression/?do=findComment&amp;comment=363730</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/6-serious-emotional-problems/">Serious Emotional Problems</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Not ego-backlash but <u>ego</u> is the root cause of depression.
</p>

<p>
	More accurately, the ego-mind is constantly evaluating, judging, and assigning meaning to reality. Depression is one of these meanings which you are creating but you are not conscious that you are creating it. It happen automatically in you because your level of consciousness is quite low.
</p>

<p>
	Try this experiment: sit comfortably at home and do not think a single thought about the future or the past. Be fully present. Strip all meaning from reality. Can you still feel depressed?
</p>

<p>
	Keep doing this until you realize that depression is something YOU ARE DOING! It is not happening to you! All negative emotions are something you create. Negativity is never found in the "external world". It arises out of how your ego-mind assigns meaning to external things based on its survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	You might say, "But Leo, what if I get cancer? Cancer caused me to be depressed!" No! The meaning YOU ASSIGN to cancer causes you to be depressed. And it possible to train yourself to stop assigning meaning to things.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness and mindfulness helps with depression. But you must actually do it. And the catch-22 is, if you're depressed, you probably don't want to do it, nor do you want to believe what I'm saying.
</p>

<title>Advice on approaching Women</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/826-emerald/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="826" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/826-emerald/" rel="">@Emerald</a> What you're missing is that attraction is not a rational choice.
</p>

<p>
	See, you're evaluating this whole situation theoretically, which is not at all how it works in real life. In real life, if a well-dressed, nice-looking guy with a big smile, confidence, and swagger stopped you while you were walking down the street and told you he found you attractive and had a fun conversation with you, all of your logic would fly out the window. It doesn't matter if he's "using a pickup line" on 100 other girls. A good approach is a good approach. The line is irrelevant. The words never matter. It's all in the tone and body language. You would be flattered, your self-esteem would be boosted, and maybe you'd get attracted to him. Attraction is never a guarantee. Often the chemistry just doesn't happen. But attraction is not something you logically decide upon. It happens near-instantly based on deep subconscious cues. Attraction happens within 5 minutes. Within 5 minutes the girl determines and demonstrates whether she's willing to sleep with the guy. The rest is just comfort-building. But she is not conscious of any of this. It all happens automatically.
</p>

<p>
	What you're not factoring into your theory is that that guy could actually attract you! If you're being fake polite, etc. that means he hasn't succeeded in attracting you. You've succeeding in rejecting him. His job was to bust through your automatic knee-jerk defense mechanism. He must do that through charm, confidence, and humor, not through meeting any logical criteria you have. Obviously if you're already married with a kid, you are much less open to approaches. But consider if you were single. (BTW, if the guy knows what he's doing, he'll check your finger for a wedding ring before even approaching you).
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is a very counter-intuitive thing. Be careful underestimating it or logically analyzing it. There is zero logic in attraction. It does not happen based on any rational standards that you may think you have. Which is precisely why girls easily get attracted to scrubs who abuse them, and yet the girl only gets more attracted!
</p>

<p>
	And even if an approach is a nuisance, this cannot be avoided because the guy has to approach the girl because the girl will almost never approach the guy. Yes, the girl incurs the cost of a creepy approach. On the other hand, the girl is freed of the hell that is approaching. You girls have no idea what it takes to make a natural approach or to be rejected dozen times in a row. You should be thankful you don't have to do it.
</p>

<p>
	It is the guy's job to approach and the girl's job to screen him for quality. That is how human mating works. Not unlike the courtship rituals of birds.
</p>

<p>
	Part of the cost of being a hot girl is that you will get approach a lot. That's both a blessing and curse. And you're not going to change that. Guys are wired to approach you. And you're wired to screen them.
</p>

<p>
	The thing with approaching is that it's not supposed to work 95% of the time. 5% is all it takes for love to happen <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> It is just like sales. And sales works precisely because people buy.

<p>
	Ultimately there is no such thing as the subconscious mind. That is a conceptual abstraction. What is real is present in your direct experience right now, and at all times.
</p>

<p>
	But more practically-speaking, yes, you can basically become conscious of anything that is "running" you. But that is WAY beyond enlightenment and will take you decades of serious work. Very very very few spiritual masters have done this. Emotional self-mastery is much harder than enlightenment.

<p>
	I never said it was a useless tool. I said it has a major downside in my mind due to its addiction potential and dulling stoning effects. It's too easily overused, becoming a chronic thing people do. It becomes recreational all to easily.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see the point in it when there are better options available like LSD, mushrooms, or 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	Edible pot is probably better than smoked pot for spiritual growth purposes. Although I'm not experienced with pot. It never appealed to me.

<p>

Yes, there are many degrees of wokeness and many degrees of embodiment and mastery. Yes, there is much left to master and become conscious of even after a deep awakening. "Full enlightenment" is virtually a fantasy and no method promises it. To become fully conscious of your entire emotional system and subconscious mind is a very tall order to fill. But even here, I think psychedelics can be helpful as you can use them to become more conscious of all aspects of yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Of course psychedelics will not do all the work for you if you're shooting for "full enlightenment". You'll need to spend THOUSANDS of hours in contemplation and self-study to achieve that.
</p>

<p>
	If psychedelics cause you to get lost in ego, that's something you're doing. It doesn't have to be that way.
</p>

<p>
	I use psychedelics quite sparingly. For every 1 trip I do hundreds of hours of meditation, integration, contemplation, and study. So there is no problem.
</p>

<p>
	If you're just tripping balls every week and doing no other spiritual work, yeah, that could become problematic.

Not the right ones, in the right ways, with the right intentions.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are very nuanced things. There is an art and a science to taking them which requires careful attention to master.
</p>

<p>
	A few trips is not anywhere near enough to figure psychedelics out. If you haven't taken 30+ trips in the proper ways, you won't really understand psychedelics. Psychedelics must also be combined with existential inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	Also, keep in mind that people have different brain types and personality types. Maybe psychedelics are not so effective for you, but for others like me, they are undeniably effective. So be careful not to over-universalize your personal limited experiences. It is a fact that psychedelics transform peoples lives. Just maybe not yours.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, I'm willing to bet you've never done a breakthrough 5-MeO-DMT trip.
</p>

I would recommend you find a yogi who's experienced in kundalini awakening and tell him your story. He should have some good advice for you.
</p>

<p>
	I also recommend you read some good books about kundalini awakening. There are exercises and practices for dealing with blockages and for venting the excess energy. I am no expert on kundalini, but from what I understand you need to get the energy out of your system with physical practices. You're not supposed to bottle it up. It has to work through and out of your system. Exercises that might help you: dancing, speaking in tongues, screaming, shaking your body, Osho's dynamic meditation, physical exercise, jumping, Hatha yoga, hitting a punching bag, etc. I would look for physical ways to vent that energy which feel best for you.
</p>

<p>
	If what you're describing really is kundalini activation, Western doctors are not going to help you, as they're clueless about it. In fact, they will probably give you harmful solutions. So go find a yogi.
