<p>
	What?? No! Just go out and be social and share yourself freely. Why are you constructing this pathetic gloomy narrative?
</p>

<p>
	Go have fun. Then come back home and meditate your ass off. You can do both.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make your socializing too serious. A Buddha should be able to go out to a bar and drink some beers with some strangers and talk shit. Then return to his Buddhahood.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, life is long and you got plenty of time to space stuff out. You don't have to do it all at once.

<p>
	Nature plays a role, but you underestimate the extent to which we construct culture and "nature".

<p>
	And all that black people could do was demand to be freed. And here we are.

	Nature is anything which occurs. So your point is moot. Feminism is as much "nature" as patriarchy is. So who's version of "nature" will prevail? That's what this whole debate is about.

<p>
	That's your opinion, and obviously many feminists disagree.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, both can be done at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	Asking women to "shut up and become more competent" before you give them respect is the very injustice and patriarchy which is in question. Why should women have to work extra hard to please you? Who are you to tell them what is right and what they must do in order to be treated as they feel is fair?
</p>

<p>
	Maybe when a person tells you that she is being treated unfairly you should take it seriously rather than telling her to work harder and be more competent? Just a crazy thought.

		<p>
			I also think that you didn't understand what I meant when I said that structure is an illusion, so let me elaborate on that. If you look at a house from the outside, you could say that the house is over there and the structure of the house is that it has 4 rooms. But then go inside the house and now the house is something that's around you, and it doesn't have four rooms anymore because, now from your perspective, the house starts at the walls that surround you. Do you see now that structure is relative to your perspective? <em>Structure</em> is not an objective thing, <em>structure </em>is one of the pattern-matching functions of the human mind.

<p>
	This dream in which we're in has a very specific structure. It has specific physical laws, rules, things, matter, energy, people, etc. This structure is not random or accidental. It was designed by an infinite intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Now I ask you, Why did infinite intelligence select this structure? Why weren't you born with a dick on your forehead?
</p>

<p>
	Ever wonder about that?
</p>

<p>
	In the end you'll discover the answer is: To maximize love.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot be explained to you any further because you'd need a massive awakening to understand it. And that's not ever going to happen from reading my words.

	It's complicated. The restrictions are systemic, cultural, psychological, and sociological. Both men and women are involved without being conscious of it.

<p>
	This case is one example of what is meant by patriarchy.
</p>

<p>
	As a basic example, many video games don't even allow the player to create a female character AT ALL! You are just forced to be male! And this is just the tip of the iceberg.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, Green isn't seeking to replace one inequality with an opposite one. Green simply asks for equality.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, in a patriarchy, the whole point is that women CANNOT do whatever they want about men because women have been denied positions of power.
</p>

<p>
	To make this example clear for you, women in Saudi Arabia cannot do whatever they want. Men actively prevent them.
</p>

<p>
	But you will say that America is not Saudi Arabia. True, it's more subtle in America, but it still exists. You just don't notice it because you're male and it doesn't even register on your radar because it is irrelevant to your ego's survival.

The point is that society & culture is dominated by certain sets of values which please one group of people while marginalizing another, and so of course the marginalized group will seek to equalize this situation.
</p>

<p>
	The problem she has is that women in video games are not depicted as women would depict themselves, but as objects for gratification for men. Which she views as unfair. And the reason this happens is because the video game developers are mostly young, immature men, so they depict women to please their own fantasies, not as women would depict themselves. If there were more women working in video games, video games would have a more fair and accurate depiction of women.
</p>

<p>
	Anyhow, don't get lost in the details. This is a thread about Stage Green, not women or video games. The details are irrelevant. What's important is that you see the structural inequality that Green sees.

<p>
	You are blaming individuals while refusing to acknowledge the systemic and collective aspects of this issue.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, self-esteem has an individual aspect, but it also has a collective and cultural aspect. Stage Green is about seeing collective aspects, which does not deny the individual aspects.
</p>

<p>
	If you really care to understand this issue, read some books on feminism to understand why feminism is needed in some areas.

<p>
	That's because you're looking at it from a Stage Orange, selfish perspective. As long as it makes your dick hard, you're good. But there are other concerns.
</p>

<p>
	For example, have you considered how such overly-sexualized depictions affect the self-esteem of young girls? What if you had a daughter and she grew up with self-esteem problems because her tits did not look like those of Tomb Raider? Then you, as the father, would have to deal with that.
</p>

<p>
	Sarkisian's point is not that all sexuality should be banned, but that things are overly-sexualized in ways which are designed to cater to men's desires, and that women are not fairly depicted as they really are, but as men want them to be for their sexual gratification.
</p>

<p>
	How would you feel if all video games were made to please the desires of butch lesbians? You wouldn't like it. How would you feel if all guys in video games were depicted with giant dicks, making your girlfriend ask you, "Why is your dick so small?"
</p>

<p>
	See, when the shoe is on the other foot, you start to cry and whine about how unfair things are. But when things are skewed in your favor, you think it's great and there is no problem.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying Sarkisian never goes too far. She's certainly stuck in unhealthy Green. But the problem is that you still don't understand her. Which is a problem not for her, but for you.
</p>

<p>
	Not a fair point when you take into account scale.
</p>

<p>
	It's a totally different challenge to provide 1+ billion people with toilets.
</p>

<p>
	Everybody overlooks the problems that come with scale. How to organize 1 billion people is a problem of epic proportions requiring a God-like intellect to solve.
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention that technology has advanced far beyond toilets.

<p>
	You should distinguish between a thing being true vs how others might use it to justify whatever devilry they want.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it is a general truism that men are physically stronger than women. But some devil could use this to justify raping women. Just because he does that does not undermine the original truth. Truth is always used by devils for selfish purposes. Clearly Sadhguru is not doing that. He's not justifying anything, he's explaining the notion of Samskara, which is a very powerful notion that would be worth your time studying and understanding. Samskara is not just genetics, it's broader and more profound than that.

	Hehe... yeah. That's exactly what high-consciousness teachings sound like. Because you are judging them from a low level of consciousness, lacking Sadhguru's decades of deep mystical experience.

All of that is dependent on different starting conditions. What the conditions and who is advantaged or disadvantaged is irrelevant, since reality unfolds in chaotic and backward ways, with one part sloping up, another sloping down, and then many oscillations and reversals.
</p>

<p>
	The development of nations is not linear, it is chaotic.
</p>

<p>
	Europe had a tremendous amount of competition which lead to lots of development.
</p>

<p>
	The actual details of the history are not important. What's important is the general principle that in a chaotic system small differences in starting conditions lead to very different evolutionary paths.
</p>

<p>
	And the ultimate point is that it is foolish to blame anyone for these developmental paths. The paths are precisely whatever they are and no one is to blame (as Sam Harris likes to do). It is like blaming a 3rd grader for not yet being a 5th grader. Well, some people take longer to reach 5th grade. Rather than blaming them, help them along.

	GamerGate is a great example of how Tier 1 fights with itself, not able to understand each other. Each side feels self-righteous and therefore unable to learn from the other side.

<p>
	You'd have to study a lot of history and culture of the Middle East.
</p>

<p>
	The classic book: Gun, Germs, and Steel makes some interesting points about how geographical conditions shape development of nations and cultures.
</p>

<p>
	It's not exactly rocket science to suggest that geography plays an important role in how nations develop and survive.
</p>

<p>
	Arabian culture was highly tribal because survival in harsh desert climates is no easy business. That strong tribalism is evident even today.
</p>

<p>
	You can think of nations almost like species. Different bird species develop and survive in different ways depending on the geography they must survive in -- as Darwin discovered and catalogued. Well, same thing with nations. Some nations develop quickly because their environment demands it. Other nations develop slowly because their environment allows for it. Some species like crocodiles have not changed much in the last 50 million years while others like birds and primates had to evolve rapidly to adapt to new emerging environments. To reduce all this complexity to problematic passages within the Quran is rather silly. The Quran itself is a byproduct of this evolutionary process of survival.
</p>

<p>
	Islam is a religion uniquely suited to survival within the conditions where it arose. Unfortunately as the world becomes more globalized Islam has difficulty adapting to more modern times. But this problem is not unique to Islam. All religions face this problem to some extent. Fundamentalism is a reactionary movement against modernization and secularism. Fundamentalist movements exist within Islam, Christianity, Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, etc. Fundamentalism is an ego backlash against modernity and post-modernity.
</p>

	In practice maintaining a harem requires a lot of lying and manipulating. The girls are never satisfied being in the harem long-term. Girls inevitably drop out and must be replaced with new ones. But it's easy for the guy to justify it to himself because he's getting laid so much.

<p>
	You can go deeply by yourself. You don't need to crawl up someone's ass to go deep. RationalWiki doesn't need to blindly follow me. All they need to do is sit down and do the practices by themselves. It would also be a mistake for RationalWiki to only listen to my teachings. They should cross-reference my teachings with those of a 100 other gurus, yogis, mystics, philosophers, psychonauts, etc. to find the common ground.
</p>

<p>
	Working through this material carefully by yourself is the key. Nothing can be taken for granted, believed, or assumed.

<p>
	If women freely elect to sleep with Bentinho, that's their business.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the trick is that his presence draws them in and charms them. So it's easy for him to build a harem if he wants.

<p>
	The mind and body are full of various impurities which must be burned out before one is able to settle comfortably and joyfully in the Void.
</p>

<p>
	Much of this "pain" is fear, trauma, and mental resistance of various sorts.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I have no serious criticisms of him. He knows his shit.
</p>

<p>
	He doesn't deny love. He talks quite a bit about Eros (his term of Love), and he says that the driving force behind all evolution is love. Which is correct in my view, although even that doesn't go far enough to underscore the importance of Love in all of Creation.
</p>

<p>
	He might not be as explicit about Infinite Love as I am, equating Love & Truth. But that's probably because he has not accessed some of the deepest insights I have accessed via psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	I think his understanding of reality would be deeper if he went deeply into psychedelics. But oh well. It's good enough. You can only ask so much of a guy. He has done several life-times-worth of amazing work.
</p>

<p>
	Ken is one of the greatest Western philosophers and intellectuals who has ever lived. We are lucky to be alive alongside him. It's sad that his health as deteriorated so quickly.

Really, the question becomes so internalized that it melt away and all you're left with is the raw present moment.
</p>

<p>
	Self-inquiry must take you out of your mind. If you're doing it as the level of mind, that's not going to do much. Out of your mind is the key. You must leave behind the verbal / logical domain.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics work by effortlessly taking you out of your mind.

<title>Spending $3000 on a Pick-Up Boot Camp - Good Idea?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/42510-spending-3000-on-a-pick-up-boot-camp-good-idea/?do=findComment&amp;comment=531556</link>

<p>
	A) You can certainly find cheaper trainings.
</p>

<p>
	B) You'd get a lot more value out of simply connecting with a few experienced wingmen in your city who can show you the ropes for free.
</p>

<p>
	Bootcamps can be a good way to get yourself in the game but the chief problem is that they are too short. Your results will not come from the bootcamp but from the daily follow-up work you do. The follow-up work is the most important part. Because every weekend needs to become your personal bootcamp.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate the importance of having just 1 or 2 experienced wingmen to go out with every weekend. This is HUGE! It's worth much more than a bootcamp in terms of results.
</p>

<p>
	But if you got the money to burn, a bootcamp can be a good way to jumpstart this whole process.
</p>

<p>
	I did a bootcamp for $2000, but I got a lot more value from finding great wingmen. I also had lots of money to burn, so $2000 was not a big deal to spend.
</p>

<p>
	You can find wingmen via online forums or by attending an RSD FreeTour in your city. Befriend everyone at the FreeTour. Get their phone numbers and start going out with them every night.
</p>

<p>
	All that a bootcamp really is, is some dude telling you to approach girls and forcing you to do it all night long. If you can discipline yourself to approach all night long, you don't really need a bootcamp. But of course this discipline is really hard for newbies, so you may need it.
</p>

<p>
	If we were doing a bootcamp, we would just walk into a club and I would point out random girls and force you to approach them. After you fail, I would just tell you to immediately approach the next girl. We would do this 20-50 times over 3-4 hours.
</p>

<title>Would an Enlightened Person be able to say no to heroin?</title>

<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Keep in mind that the Absolute is distinct from the structures of the mind/brain/self. Which means it's possible to awaken but still have addictions. Because addictions are baked into the structure of the mind/brain/self. Awakening itself does not necessarily change the mind/self. Which is why an awakened person can still smoke cigs, have a porn addiction, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can think of it this way: awakening disidentifies you from your mind. But the mind still continues to fire according to its lifetime of karma. If you spent a lifetime watching porn, your mind has been programmed with that habit, and awakening will not automatically remove all that. You will have to retrain your mind.
</p>

<p>
	This is why many awakened people are still flawed and still have bad habits and cravings.
</p>

<p>
	The mistaken assumption is that awakening will perfect the mind. This is simply untrue in practice. What perfects the mind is deliberate training, which many people neglect to do, especially after an awakening or two.
</p>

<p>
	Perfecting the mind is harder than awakening.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you could get many awakened people hooked on heroin. Because in truth they ain't that awake.
</p>

<p>
	YES! This is exactly what awakening is about.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not something you think. It's more felt. It's pure, raw experience. Ideally the mind is shut off or at least sidelined.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is nothing other than the present moment, observed intensely for what it is.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like this Kratom helped you enter a mild samadhi state. It's not an out of body experience, it's a nondual state of consciousness. Which is exactly what you want in this work. From this state you can now contemplate metaphysical questions and get profound answers -- not verbal answers but actual answers!

<p>
	There is much deeper to go. You are only seeing the tip of the Ox's tail. So keep exploring.

<p>
	This is such a fluke condition that you cannot apply it other mental disorders.
</p>

<p>
	Mental disorders are legion, and most of them will slow down your path to awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are also some "disorders" which are called disorders but really are not. Don't forget that "disorder" is relative notion.
</p>

<p>
	Many a foolish doctor would call enlightenment a "disorder", without realizing that being a doctor is the real disorder here.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't it funny how considering oneself to be a human is not considered a disorder? Talk about self-bias! Lol

<title>Criticism of Ken Wilber</title>

<p>
	Having read the criticisms in more depth, I want to underscore that many criticisms of Ken Wilber are foolish and that the bulk of his written work is as solid as can be.
</p>

<p>
	Minor criticisms like his support for Andrew Cohen, Adi Da, and his over-emphasis of the Mean Green Meme and his political prescriptions are all knit-picks compared to the bulk of his written work, which is solid, and which has little to do with those things.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get distracted by the politics surrounding the Integral Institute. Just focus on his written work, which is genius.
</p>

<p>
	And as always, don't expect any teacher to be perfect in their embodiment or conduct.
</p>

<p>
	The criticism's of Ken Wilber found on the following website, for example, are pure BS:

<title>Suicide for a good cause - Ego or Selflessness?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	It can be an act of selflessness. Think of Christ or Gandhi. You can basically sacrifice yourself for your life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	But this is still all part of the relative domain of life/death. From the Absolute perspective there is no one to die.
</p>

<p>
	But if you get it in your mind this idea of "I will sacrifice myself in the name of glory and I will go down in history as a good human being." << That's ego
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to create a self-righteous fantasy about sacrificing yourself. Rather, act as though you are not important at all.
</p>

<p>
	There is no sense is committing suicide for a good cause. No good cause requires your suicide. Rather just do your work and if you happen to get killed in the process by some haters, so be it. But if you actively try to be a martyr, that's ego.
</p>

<p>
	A true martyr never tries to be martyr. He's just doing his work and others react to it.
</p>

<p>
	If your life becomes selfless and has great impact on others, you will naturally develop haters who wish you harm.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of the notion of a soul is that it persists between lifetimes as an intermediate structure between the human self and the Godhead.
</p>

<p>
	If soul is just ego, the notion of soul isn't needed at all. The point is in its being prior to ego.

<p>
	It is no different than it not existing.
</p>

<p>
	It has nowhere to go, so to speak, and nothing else to be.
</p>

<p>
	Anywhere it goes, it is nowhere and nothing.
</p>

<p>
	From the highest POV, there is no difference between the universe existing and it not.

<p>
	Like I said, these are nuanced distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	Of course from the ultimate absolute level nothing can be distinct at all, at which point soul merges into the godhead.

<p>
	No, soul is not the same as ego.
</p>

<p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course you cannot ever be totally independent of your sources and influences, but that is not really a problem.
</p>

<p>
	All that's important is that you don't follow others too closely and diversify your sources.
</p>

<p>
	Keep a healthy distance from your teachers/gurus. Learn from them but follow your own path.
</p>

<p>
	Don't go crawling up your teacher's butthole. Don't go live with them. Don't go work for them. Don't go sleep with them.
</p>

<p>
	This is just such obvious stuff. Yet people blindly do it and then act shocked when they get hurt.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, if you let your guru stick his dick inside you, you will regret it. That was your fault really for letting things get that far.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to maintain healthy boundaries.
</p>

			Are you denying the existence of individual souls? Are you telling us that everybody is the same God and there is no such thing as an individual Soul? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Depends on how you look at it.
</p>

<p>
	At the highest level of consciousness a soul is none other than God. So in this sense there is no soul. All souls are just partitions in the mind of God and made of nothing.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			If everybody is God, then how can God, that is perfect, be submissive to illusion? If the soul equals to God, then how can the individual Soul find itself subject to the limiting effects of illusion? Doesn't that lead to the conclusion that illusion is superior to God because it has the power to put God under illusion?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The answer to this set of questions must of course be riddled with paradox since we are now talking about the Absolute using dualiatic language.
</p>

<p>
	If God is unlimited, it must be unlimited in its ability to limit itself, otherwise it would not be unlimited. If God could not constrain itself inside an illusion if its own making, that would be a limit, which contradicts its unlimitedness. This God is so all-powerful it can fool itself. Illusion is not superior to God because God wills the illusion into existence, and also because there is no difference between illusion and reality, superior and inferior. All of these differences only exist in the mind of God and nowhere else.
</p>

<p>
	God IS the power of infinite illusion. Illuison IS creation! Illusion IS God's greatest power.
</p>

<p>
	If you just imagine an infinite mind, you can easily see that this mind can easily imagine being a finite thing, like a table or a kangaroo or a human. Just as you as a human adult can imagine yourself to be a child. It's easy to imagine something less than you, hard to imagine something greater than you. It's hard for a donkey to imagine God, but easy for God to imagine a donkey.

</blockquote>

<p>
	My point is precisely: No!
</p>

<p>
	Blindly following even the best human being of all time will result in evil.
</p>

<p>
	Goodness is not a function of content, but structure. Conformity is the structure of evil.
</p>

<p>
	Blind following is what created mankind's greatest evils. The core problem is blindness. If you are blind, you will commit evil. Nothing can compensate for being blind. And no one can make you see but yourself.

<p>
	Seems like fair criticism.
</p>

<p>
	What must be remembered is that self-bias, survival, self-deception, partialness, and incompleteness are unescapable aspects of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	The desire to follow Ken Wilber blindly rather than thinking independently for yourself is the crucial mistake. Trying to join and follow groups too closely is the key mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Why on Earth would anyone want to join some "integral institute" and follow the work of one man blindly?
</p>

<p>
	Everything must be thought through for yourself.
</p>

	Imagine death? Lol. Death has always been imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Without imagination there cannot be a notion of death.
</p>

<p>
	If you're thinking "death", that's you imagining it.
</p>

<p>
	Even the notion of suicide is imaginary, since you must imagine yourself not existing. Which is an impossibility.

<p>
	That's going to become a trap.
</p>

<p>
	To awaken you're going to have to face the truth that all meaning is imaginary. This will feel depressing and nihilistic to the ego. Awakening only comes AFTER you let go of all desire for meaning. The ego is a meaning-constructing machine. It will not want to surrender all meaning. It will backlash hard against it. It needs meaning to survive. But so long as you are stuck in survival mode you are not truly awake.
</p>

<p>
	So your desire for an antidote is the very thing which will keep you from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to awaken you must bite the bullet and face the meaninglessness head-on, without any cushion or comfort. This may result in a Dark Night of the Soul as the ego dies a slow painful death, facing the fact that everything you believed in and hoped for was a lie.
</p>

<p>
	Only AFTER ALL THAT, awakening dawns and what seems like nihilism become DIVINITY.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is DIVINITY. But divinity requires a total loss of meaning. You cannot reach divinity by clinging to antidotes.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move is to let go of meaning. Take a leap of faith into emptiness. Drown in a lake of meaninglessness and see what lies on the bottom.
</p>

<p>
	Again, all that is your own projection.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind serves up whatever you want to see/hear. So it's no surprise you get all your ideas validated.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is that all the US intelligence agencies agree that Russian was involved in the 2016 election and is still continuing it's manipulation. Roger Stone, Trump's contact with WikiLeaks was just sent to prison for lying to congress about his connections. Trump himself asked on live TV for Russia to hack and release Hillary's emails. Case closed.
</p>

<p>
	You think by having an edgy non-mainstream opinions that you're somehow being smart, but you're just being foolish. Just because your opinion differs from the mainstream doesn't make it true. When you challenge the mainstream you have to be grounded in something solid, not just being edgy. The US intelligence agencies are a lot smarter than you.

	Science cannot ever tell you what anything is. Because science is relative. All it's doing is telling you relative differences between things, never what the thing actually is.
</p>

<p>
	For example, science cannot tell you want a cat is, it can only tell you how a cat is different from a non-cat.

	The more conscious one becomes, the more one's life becomes about spreading love to others.

<p>

<p>
	Drop the fantasy and enjoy the present moment. You can't find happiness anywhere but HERE & NOW.

<p>
	You aren't talking with enough girls, that's the only reason.
</p>

<p>
	Talk to more girls and you'll get a GF. Stop making this some deep metaphysical ordeal.
</p>

<p>
	You should get rejected by 5 girls per night. Then success will come quickly. You are getting rejected too little.

<p>
	Is there really a romance, or is it all in your mind?
</p>

<p>
	Just because you see it as a romance does not mean she does.
</p>

<p>
	There is a tendency for desperate guys to see a romance where none exists from the girl's POV.

<p>
	It's all gonna depends on the specific condition and person.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking, such disabilities will make it harder.
</p>

<p>
	Mental sharpness is an important foundation for this work. The people who awaken are usually high-functioning people, not people who can barely tie their own shoelaces.

</p>

<p>
	That is the most powerful technology. Nothing else comes close.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that any technology which truly worked at radically altering your consciousness would be made illegal because it would destabilize the mind and undermine the illusion of society and its power structures.
</p>

<p>
	If a technology can make you awaken, it can also make you lose your mind.

<p>
	Of course, after the successful manipulation in 2016, now every foreign government will try the same. It's open season. Our inaction and denial only invites further manipulation.
</p>

<p>
	It's clear to everyone now that if Trump is helped by foreign manipulation, Trump himself will welcome it and protect the manipulators because all he cares about is winning at any cost. This is the essence of treason.
</p>

<p>
	Russia has a special position though because of Trump's finacial ties with Russian oligarchs. They underwrote his loans and enabled his whole fake career. China is not as well situated. And Russians have worldclass hackers with zero ethical standards.

<p>
	Of course, because there is nothing but states of consciousness. Whatever state of consciousness you find yourself in, it completely sets the parameters of what you can access and do.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why someone in the wromg state of consciousness will never awaken or understand.
</p>

<p>
	Also, awakening cannot be stored in memory because memory cannot be formlessness.
</p>

			I feel the same way about the exchange of money part of the equation, but I'm not sure if that isn't my own problem. If it wasn't for the exchange of money, I wouldn't have any reservations, would you?

</blockquote>

<p>
	I have no problem with exchange of money because teachers gotta eat. It takes a lot of time and work to coach people 1 on 1.
</p>

<p>
	Even if it was free, giving people false promises about instant enlightenment is problematic because if it doesn't work it sours the student's path. It makes students believe awakening must be easy so they stop working for it.
</p>

<p>
	The proper attitude to cultivate in students is one of hard work and disciplined practice. And if it happens easily and quickly for you, that will be a nice surprise. But don't count on it.

			I know little about Sadhguru, and have watched many of his videos. When I look at Tiger woods or Arnold, it is easy for me to see their results of their hardcore training and dedication. For Sadhguru, I fail to see why he is so advanced. I cannot look at him and see what makes him advanced and separates him from many other spiritual people.

<p>
	No, such things cannot be explained to you.

	You either get it or you don't.

<p>
	Do 10 years of spiritual research and practice and maybe you'll start to understand. Maybe.

<title>Awaken Instantly with The Fredness!!</title>

</p>

<p>
	This is a classic bullshit marketing tactic and it should not be accepted because it gives spirituality a bad name. Someone will go to Fred, fail to instantly awaken, and then start to believe that it's all BS or that something is wrong with her, when in fact this is the normal result.

But the way he sells and markets them as instant easy enlightenment is a problem. It is just not true.
</p>

<p>
	Fred cannot awaken any given random person, but he acts like he can. This is what I have a problem with.

<p>
	I have warned people of the dangers of misusing psychedelics.

<p>
	I feel that my descriptions of psychedelics have been fairly accurate. I don't sell them as some easy solution.

<title>Hypnosis for enlightenment</title>

</p>

<p>
	Awakening literally requires nothing. Anything you add takes away from it.
</p>

<p>
	All you must do to awaken is sit totally still and be fully present of the NOW for very long periods of uninterrupted time. Your mind must go as quiet as possible. Just total stillness and focus.
</p>

<p>
	You might be able to use hypnosis to quiet the mind and focus it on the present moment. But then just sit there and be present. It takes a lot of presence. So much presence you start to hallucinate a bit and your visual field goes wavey.
</p>

<p>
	Mental activity and lack of focus is the number obstacle to awakening. Anything you do to try to hasten the process is mental activity, which slows down the process. So it's about learning how to get out of your own way.
</p>

<p>
	Or just take a psychedelic.
</p>
