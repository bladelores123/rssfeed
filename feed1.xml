<p>
	It is everything and everywhere.

<p>
	Look at a coffee table. It's made out of infinite intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	EVERYTHING!

<p>
	I have not come around to anything.

<p>
	You are still conflating relative & absolute domains.

	Notice the nuance in how I phrased things.

<p>
	When the world disappears, what problems are left to solve? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Problems only occur within the relative domain, as a function of survival. They are important to solve, but only from the relative domain. From the Absolute nothing needs solving.
</p>

<p>
	The most powerful way of solving a problem is by realizing it's not even a problem.
</p>

<p>
	No, during the peak of the trip all these crazy synchronicities were noticed. I would describe it as miraculous.
</p>

<p>
	But only inside the trip. Outside the trip life appears ordinary.

<p>
	I have taken it on 3 consequential days and saw no tolerance.
</p>

<p>
	I'm assuming it works like DMT or 5-MeO-DMT, which have no tolerance. Which means you could take it multiple times per day. But I have not tired that. I strongly suspect it would work.
</p>

<p>
	It is not like mushrooms or LSD.

<p>
	What do you mean by debilitating?
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to say. You could try a small doses and get a feel for the vibrations to see if you are okay with them. For me it's no problem.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all psychedelics can be carefully tasted at very low doses. So there doesn't have to be any risk. You are the one who's in control of the risk. A wise person would always start with a threshold dose of a new substance, thus eliminating all potential risk. Even your grandma could handle a threshold dose of any substance.
</p>

<p>
	People mostly run into problems only when they dose too high too soon.

<p>
	This is also an improper way of looking at it.

<p>
	Wish instead to love it all exactly as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Stop hating your own self. Anything in the universe which you hate is you hating yourself. The solution is to love yourself instead.

<p>
	Do not confuse absolute and relative matters.
</p>

<p>
	The context of this thread is a relative one about human societies, religion, etc. Within such a context, social science and developmental psychology (like Spiral Dynamics) is applicable and useful.
</p>

<p>
	The materialistic paradigm is a totally different context. The context there is the ultimate nature of reality, in which case it is incorrect. But the materialistic paradigm is great if you want to land a rover on Mars.
</p>

<p>
	Science isn't all wrong. It's just limited to certain contexts and it cannot address the ultimate metaphysical questions.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there is good science and bad science. Science which contradicts nonduality is bad science. Although even it can be useful in certain narrow situations like building a new iPhone.
</p>

<p>
	Who decide which science is good and which is bad? You do, of course! You are the ultimate arbiter of truth. Since you are God and you are imagining this whole game. Whatever you say is true and good will be true and good from your POV.
</p>

<p>
	I don't think so because what it means to be human is to be limited in specific ways. Humans are a very crude species. We are extremely limited compared to other possible beings.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, humans and ants are ultimately one. But that does not mean an ant can do calculus. From an ant's POV a human being can perform miracles.

<p>
	Your son, your letter, the universe, your life, and your death are all being imagined in the mind of God.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness does not leave the body. The body is an imagination of infinite consciousness. Consciousness is what you really are, and it cannot go anywhere because it imagines all possible locations.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is nothing, nowhere, nohow, nowhen.

But in case he actually could do these things, then he probably did it similarly to how you described how imagination works. You said that - in an even deeper state of consciousness - you could probably turn your hand (with your imagination) into tentacles. That would be how Jesus turned water into wine. Then Jesus must have been incredibly deeply enlightened when this was his baseline consciousness. (except the ability to do these things doesn't necessarily require such a deep enlightenment but can also be attained for example through a kundalini awakening as a siddhi)
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that would be how.
</p>

<p>
	Extraordinary healing is definitely possible from everything I understand.
</p>

<p>
	There's an interesting possibility which people overlook about Jesus. Jesus may not have been a human being. So trying to replicate his results may simply be impossible for humans.

		</p>

		<p>
			If you become the Godhead and you start imagining healing yourself, can you actually see the changes happening or is it only a feeling? Maybe more radical than that would be a situation where a person is sitting next to you and sees your hand turn into a tentacle - do you think that's possible?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The person sitting next to you will cease to be person long before your hand turns into a tentacle.
</p>

<p>
	If you do large enough doses you could probably experience your hand as a tentacle, but then it will shift back. Like it could in a dream. Stop thinking of your dreams as unreal. They are as real as the physical world. So all that crazy stuff you are able to do in your dreams is God imagining new realities.

<p>
	God is all there ever is. Everything is God at all times, but you are not aware of this fact because you are so busy imagining being human.
</p>

<p>
	To be human is to imagine you are human. This conflicts with being the Godhead. It's hard to be both at once. Your whole life is just God experiencing humanness. God is relentless about it. Becoming conscious of God does not help your survival, and you are so wrapped up in survival that you cannot help yourself. You do not know how to stop and you are scared to death of God. So you actively avoid God, Truth, and Love. Because it's too good for your human mind to handle.

			This seems to be a chicken and egg issue you've skirted over. Materialists are close minded because they haven't directly experienced the absolute, but those who have experienced the absolute and draw different conclusions are close minded because they are in the materialist paradigm. So what makes your direct experience worth more than the next's? Are your experiences not just as colored as theirs are?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is a big difference between nonduality and all models/theories about reality. They are not even in the same ballpark. It's not about drawing conclusions. Nonduality is Absolutely Absolute. It is not a function of a mind explaining things. Explanation itself becomes impossible at such levels.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who tries to advance a theory or model of reality is immediately wrong. It's obvious they do not understand that reality is Infinity and cannot be modeled in any way. They are not conscious of what God is. They are not conscious of how they are imagining all of reality, including all of their models.
</p>

<p>
	Those who have experienced the Absolute draw very similar conclusions to me.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful assuming that just because someone smoked some DMT and spoke to some aliens that they have experienced the Absolute. There are also many degrees of depth to the Absolute. Some people have only experienced the Absolute in a shallow way, without understanding its full ramifications for their worldview. It's not merely enough to take psychedelics, one has to deeply contemplate the right questions. Most DMT users are not contemplating anything because their trips are 5 minutes of utter chaos. For example, Joe Rogan talks about DMT a lot, but he does not understand the Absolute. Nor would I expect him to because he's not seriously investigating the substrate of reality. DMT is not a good substance for deep understanding because it's too fast acting.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality has a lot of detours, astral realms, and other weird things to it. But Absolute Consciousness trumps them all. It is the ultimate source of all possible realities. It is the Groundless Ground. It is God. It is infinity. You are God, you are infinity.

<p>
	Sounds right. 40mg of 5-MeO is a crazy dose.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, you can take many psychedelics at crazy high doses and experience crazy and impossible things. You just gotta be very careful. I deliberately do not take high doses. I take as much as I feel I can handle at the moment. This gradually grows me and allows me to handle more and more radical things. I proceed very cautiously. Where most people using psychedelics are like the rabbit, I am like the tortoise. I expect to discover many new things yet.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I cannot speak for you.
</p>

<p>
	For me, it's similar to 5-MeO-DMT in that it creates a state of total nondual consciousness, but then I'm also able to use my mind to contemplate whatever interests me and guide the trip in that direction. It's got a vibratory body energy more so than 5-MeO and it's more visual like a low dose of mushrooms. At higher doses the visuals will become more serious. I did not get serious visuals at 50mg.
</p>

<p>
	It lasts almost exactly twice as long. Which is awesome for contemplating. 5-MeO never quite lasts long enough for me.
</p>

<p>
	For me 2C-B has a terrible heavy body load. I don't enjoy that. LSD also tends to make my body feel uncomfortably alien. I enjoy the body feel of DPT more. 5-MeO-DMT probably has the least body feel of them all for me, which is nice.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to definitely say that DPT is better than 5-MeO-DMT. I love them both. Both have something unique to offer. Both deserve to be at the top.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know what parallel realities means. To me there is only one reality and one consciousness which imagines everything else.
</p>

<p>
	At moderate doses I could control it pretty well in a non-egotistical way. I could use my intention to guide me. That was nice. I could for example use my intention to heal myself or to contemplate a topic I was interested in.
</p>

<p>
	At higher doses I'd imagine you'd lose control and it would turn into insanity.
</p>

<p>
	I find that mushrooms can produces some delusional thoughts. But DPT is not like that for me. DPT is very true in my experience. When you are in the Absolute it is totally self-validating. It cannot have any external frames of reference. You just magically know that it's absolutely true. It is an understanding beyond ordinary human thoughts. It's like the understanding of God himself.

	Well of course ego-death is God. It's just a question of how deeply you penetrate it. Sometimes its shallow, sometimes its very deep.

<p>
	You would not want to plug PsychonautWiki's snorting dosages. That would be INSANITY.
</p>

<p>
	Their smoked dosages are accurate for plugging is what I meant. I have not smoked DPT so I don't know about what the best smoking dosages are. Sounds like starting low is a good idea.

<p>
	Interesting note: Stan Grof did testing of DPT for treatment of alcoholics back in the 50's and 60's. I can definitely see it working for addiction recovery and treatment of depression.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, if an anxious or depressed person takes DPT, they might be in for some hell as their negative mind might become realized.

	I have not tried it on account of its dangers.

<p>
	I assume it has some value. But from what I hear its too wild, chaotic, and nonsensical for our purposes.

	I can verify that musical enhancement is pretty awesome on this substance.

<p>
	I have not experienced any darkness from it. Just pure God & Love.
</p>

<p>
	Interesting how that is. It seems to affect people very differently. It really unlocks the power of one's imagination, so whatever darkness exists in you may become manifest.

			Also there is a church in Manhattan called The Church of True Inner Light that use DPT as their main sacrament. I remember getting their info-pdf. Pretty weird stuff. They basically believe in a Christian doctrine and that DPT is"weird and scary" until you go in with the belief that Christianity is right then it reveils Christian themed visuals and atmosphere. So it seems it can be deceptive to people that are naive, imo. Even more than your average psych

<p>
	Yeah, I read about it. Seems like a wacky cult-like organization. But they sure did pick a great chemical to start a religion around <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	DPT will completely unlock one's imagination, so whatever religious imagery one believes in will become manifest. Or if you believe in pure nonduality, that will become manifest.
</p>

<p>
	On DPT I was actually able to integrate and understand all of the world's religious imagery simultaneously. It was an awesome degree of total integration which cannot be accomplished via ordinary thought. It was like a multi-dimensional integration and simultaneous understanding of all symbolic systems ever invented by mankind. All human symbolic understanding is relative and arbitrary. Yet all of it can also be meaningful to the one holding it.

<p>
	Just be ware that many of those negative trip reports can be very misleading. For me the experience is purely positive and pleasant.
</p>

<p>
	Dosages on PsychonautWiki seem to be pretty accurate. Rectal doses are similar to smoked dosages! Making it very potent.
</p>

<p>
	For me, rectal doses go like this:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Light: 20mg-30mg
	</li>
	<li>
		Medium: 30mg-40mg
	</li>
	<li>
		Heavy: 50mg+
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	But I'm pretty sensitive to all psychedelics, so you may need to dose higher.
</p>

<p>
	Your starting dose should be no higher than 20mg to get a feel for the body load and vibrations.
</p>

<p>
	With rectal administration the trip will start within 15 minutes, hit strong by 25 minutes, and last strongly until 2h30m. After effects tend to linger for quite a long time, at least a few more hours but you'll be out of the breakthrough zone by 2h30m.
</p>

<p>
	Be very cautious with anything above 50mg. It will melt your reality.
</p>

<p>
	DPT does not seem to come in any other form but HCl. The freebase version of DPT is oily and not suitable for storage from what I hear.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, and DPT HCl refuses to dissolve in water at all. You can still make a suspension, but the actual DPT particles will not dissolve. This isn't a problem per se. It absorbs into the body just the same. But emptying the oral syringe is a bit trickier because sometimes the particles tend to stay in the back of the syringe requiring a bit more effort to deliver the full dose.

And suffer through the hell of not getting what you want.
</p>

<p>
	There is no shortcut here. You're gonna have to suffer until that ego finally gives up and dies. The ego will not just give up its most important desires without massive struggle.
</p>

<p>
	To achieve this you're basically talking about giving up your entire life. It's harder than suicide. Which is why virtually no body does it.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is the very thing you've been avoiding your whole life: death.

<p>
	Salvia is not scheduled in the US. They sell salvia at local smoke shops in Vegas. You can buy it legally. At least you used to be able to. Not sure about how it is now in 2019.
</p>

<p>
	It's so backwards too, because salvia truly deserves to be regulated. It's a dangerous substance.

Reality is not a simulation, it is not digital, it is not some hyper-space DMT realm, and it is not occurring inside any brain.
</p>

<p>
	All of that is a subset of Infinite Consciousness. So watch out for people who smoke too much DMT. Their understanding is not ultimate no matter how many aliens they encounter or talk to.
</p>

<p>
	The author is still subtly attached to materialism and scientific modeling. Which is why he cannot understand the ultimate nondual level.
</p>

<p>
	That's a big if for many people. If it blindsides you, you'll be in for hell.
</p>

<p>
	And be careful not to get cocky. A few good trips doesn't make you immune.

Even a hyper-dimensional brain complex is not as permanent as Infinite Consciousness itself.
</p>

<p>
	The final task is: become God, not some alien brain complex. Alien brain complexes are a tiny part of God's imagination.

<p>
	Yes, but I am allowed to have my opinions and analysis of it.
</p>

<p>
	In fact I stated that I am adding onto the original model.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that they took this model from Clare Graves, then trademarked it.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if someone trademarked Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. And then blocked anyone from teaching it unless it was taught precisely as they wanted.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of science is to share models, innovate upon them, and point out their limitations.

<p>
	My guess is that one of the Spiral Dynamics founders filed the trademark complaint to take it down.
</p>

<p>
	He might do the same for all of my Spiral Dynamics videos. And YouTube gives me no mechanism for disputing it. They just delete the entire video without warning! It's absurd.
</p>

<p>
	It's BS because trademarks appear in video titles all the time. How many videos use trademark names like Star Wars, Disney, etc? Millions of them. That is fair use.

	The fact that you consider the world of form "a dualistic distraction" is precisely why I'm telling you to keep your eyes open. So your visual field can be recontextualized into Nothing.

<p>
	It's more common since it's unscheduled in most places.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO was really hard to find for a few years until Canadian labs started making it about a year ago. 5-MeO-DMT is unscheduled in Canada. Which makes Canada my new favorite country <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<p>
	Start on milder substances and slowly build up your trips. After 20 to 50 breakthrough trips you'll start to feel like you can handle anything. Getting good at psychedelics takes a lot of breakthrough trips. This is one of those fields you could spend 10 years mastering, like golf or guitar. The more experience you gain the better and better your results become.
</p>

<p>
	Your first 10 trips are nothing. Just games really. The real rewards come later.

</p>

<p>
	What you have to understand about becoming famous is, the best way to get famous is to put yourself next to other famous people, regardless of who they are. This is a very common tactic in marketing. Then you can brag, "I interviewed Eckhart Tolle" and people think you are somebody important.
</p>

<p>
	It's marketing 101. The more famous of a person you can appear next to, the better. This is why people pay $100k to get photos with the US President. Then they hang that photo up in their office and it doubles the amount business deals they can close.
</p>

<p>
	My dad has a photo of himself with George H W Bush. He must have paid $10k to $100k for it. I don't know how much exactly he paid. But when you have a photo of yourself shaking the US President's hand, that's worth more than $100k to a serious businessman.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Freebase plugs just fine, just as easy as HCl.
</p>

<p>
	It does not burn at all.
</p>

<p>
	Freebase is actually slightly more potent per same volume.
</p>

<p>
	I highly recommend plugging freebase.
</p>

<p>
	If you need help dissolving it, just add a few drops of ordinary household vinegar before adding water.
</p>

<p>
	Freebase actually dissolves easier than oxalate.
</p>

<p>
	Freebase is thus the best form of 5-MeO since it both vapes and plugs great.
</p>

<p>
	Although maybe oxalate stores better. Not sure but my guess is that oxalate will store forever. That stuff looks invincible!

</p>

<p>
	Most psychedelics have been used by many thousands of people safely.
</p>

<p>
	In fact they are healing substances.
</p>

<p>
	Some research chems are known to be dangerous, but not the one I'm talking about.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you want 100% guarantees then don't take anything ever, including your tap water.
</p>

<p>
	I would be more worried about the food you eat giving you cancer than that psychedelics will somehow poison you.
</p>

<p>
	When you take a substance you can generally feel if it is healthy or not. Some substances feel dirty and you don't even want to redo them.
</p>

<p>
	Alexander Shulgin personally synthesized and tested over 100 new psychedelics on himself. So it's not like I am the first person testing this stuff. It's all been tested long before me.
</p>

<p>
	I am merely picking out the cream of the crop for purposes of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine inventing 100 new psychedelics and testing them all on yourself! The first human to ever try them! Now that's terrifying.
</p>

<p>
	Shulgin lived to 88.

	One bad thing about it is that it make Rubin's show seem more legitimate than it really is.

<p>
	As an extreme example imagine Eckhart Tolle interviewed by Saddam Hussein. Kinda silly.

<title>The N,N-DMT Mega-Thread</title>

<p>
	I have some news to report on this topic.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately plugging does not seem to work well for N,N-DMT. Up to 50mg produces almost no effect. So if plugging does work it will take 100mg-200mg, which is quite a lot of substance. Rather wasteful and not too comfortable on the ol bum.
</p>

<p>
	Tis a shame. Seems like N,N-DMT is one of the few psychedelics that does not plug well.
</p>

<p>
	Snorting it is quite nasty and doesn't produce a decent high. You'd have to snort a LOT of it and it burns like hell, even in salt form, nevermind the freebase. The drip is vile. 5-MeO-DMT is far more pleasant to snort.
</p>

<p>
	The only method I've tried is plugging. And it works great.
</p>

<p>
	But it can also be snorted, smoked, and so on, like most substances.
</p>

<p>
	It even works orally, but this method wastes too much substance so it's not worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is perfect. It comes on silky smooth and lasts a long time and it is still powerful enough for a ++++ breakthrough experience.

<p>
	It's unlikely such people will give you the spiritual support you seek.
</p>

<p>
	This is why, traditionally, shamans and yogis would go off on their own. They leave their friends and family to pursue the spiritual path seriously. Then they return back home with newfound wisdom and know how to handle the situation without needing anything from those people. And/or they make new friends who are on their level.
</p>

<p>
	Being a shaman is not easy! Precisely because you have to go against the grain of society and you will not get emotional support from those closest to you. You must be independent-minded to be a shaman because others will think of you as a witch.
</p>

<p>
	Become as self-sufficient as possible. That's a great way to grow. Later you can swing your pendulum back towards socializing and relationships.
</p>

<p>
	But a shaman needs to be really comfortable being alone in the silence. The emotional support you seek will come from cultivating your connection with God.
</p>

<p>
	That's just not true. All democratic governmental reforms and innovations had to start somewhere. They start in the minds of a few people and then spread to the millions.
</p>

<p>
	Take a look at the ideas of Karl Marx as just one example. Granted, they spread problematically in many cases, but spread they did to billions of people and they have reshaped politics and societies all over the world in the last 100 years.
</p>

<p>
	So ideas matter. The pen is mightier than the sword.

<p>
	The nature of logic is that it will always end in paradox and self-contraction due to the problem of self-reference which I explained in my video:

	</li>
	<li>
		The Metaphysical Implications Of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem - Part 1

<p>
	Any complete logical framework MUST be self-contradictory. Any non-contradictory logical framework MUST be incomplete. This is what Godel proved. And it is true.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's what makes my tests tricky. I have so much experience at this point and such a deep theoretical foundation that my trips are not your typical trips. For me each trip goes deeper and deeper, regardless of which substance. Mushrooms are not what they used to be for me. But even so, I hit a new level on this substance. Is it 100% due to the substance? No, it's a combination of factors. But this substance still seems pretty awesome to me.
</p>

<p>
	This substance will have great variability for different people because it really opens up your consciousness to go wherever your mind wants. For me this works great because my mind only cares about one thing: knowing God. But this is not most people.
</p>

<p>
	The thing I love about this substance in particular are:
</p>

<p>
	1) It's slow-acting like molasses, allowing me to introspect and contemplate like on no other psychedelic. I can get ultimate insights about anything and everything better than with 5-MeO-DMT, which is too fast and racey. To me, this degree of contemplate seems impossible for any ordinary human to accomplish. The ordinary human mind simply cannot do such things. It's like unlocking the mind of a highly advanced alien species that can think in 5 dimensions.
</p>

<p>
	2) I love its healing properties. It feels like I can use it to intentionally rewire my mind and body. All I have to do it imagine it and it happens. It feels like if one had cancer this substance could expand consciousness enough to heal it using one's will. But of course that's not proven. Just my hunch. It probably wouldn't work in all cases and I may be exaggerating it. But also maybe not! More testing required. I could see how this thing could cure things like depression or other kinds of psychological hang-ups if used properly.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, he's a beast.
</p>

<p>
	DO NOT try that at home! You will fuck yourself up badly. Even 5 grams of dried mushrooms can get hairy.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend staying in the 1-4 gram range. At higher doses mushrooms are one of the most challenging psychedelics because of how twisted and uncontrollable they can be.
</p>

<p>
	My worst trip ever was on 4 grams.

	It also seems to have no tolerance, similar to 5-MeO and DMT. Although this requires some further testing.

<p>
	This substance seems better suited for that goal. It tends to penetrate deeper than 5-MeO-DMT. 5-MeO-DMT it just a bit too fast, it tends to come and go. This new substance seems to rewire the brain more. Or at least I'm able to use my will/intention to tell it to rewire me. This requires more testing to see what could come of it. Seems like a promising tool so far. I can see this being a tool to purify a lot of baggage, thus leading to better embodiment in everyday life.
</p>

<p>
	I see a lot of potential in it if used properly with the right intentions by an experience student of nonduality/spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I don't know how well it works for other people. I just know it works great for me.
</p>

<p>
	It is does not overload the body and it expands consciousness so much that you are actually able to heal your body through pure imagination. At least my initial trials suggest it can be used this way. How you would use it I cannot say.
</p>

<p>
	It feels very healthy to me. No nasty side effects. I find it very pleasant and therapeutic. It doesn't have any hang over or exhaustion for me.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if done the right way.
</p>

<p>
	Misuse can surely happen and most people would freak out on this substance. It will turn your whole reality inside out. So this one is only for the most hardcore and experienced psychnauts and spiritual seekers.
</p>

<p>
	If your mind is impure, you will be taking a trip straight to hell with this one. If your mind is pure, it will be a 2 hour trip straight to Nirvana.

<p>
	It activates more energy in the body than 5-MeO, causing a desire to vibrate parts of your body.

<title>The DPT Mega-Thread</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I discovered a new psychedelic which is as powerful if not more powerful than 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	It is: DPT
</p>

<p>
	Here is my DPT Trip Report video: <a href="https://www.actualized.org/insights/dpt-the-other-god-molecule" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/insights/dpt-the-other-god-molecule</a>
</p>

<p>
	This will be our go-to thread about DPT related questions, tips, techniques, etc.
</p>

<p>
	As usual, no sourcing questions.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some good reference links:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		<a href="https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT" rel="external nofollow">https://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/DPT</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://erowid.org/chemicals/dpt/" rel="external nofollow">https://erowid.org/chemicals/dpt/</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="https://www.bluelight.org/xf/threads/dpt-subthread-dpt-dosage-methods-of-administration.399044/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.bluelight.org/xf/threads/dpt-subthread-dpt-dosage-methods-of-administration.399044/</a>
	</li>

	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Summary:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		DPT is for highly experienced users only. It's very powerful
	</li>
	<li>
		DPT can produce horrific trips for some people, so be careful
	</li>
	<li>
		The best way of taking DPT is rectally
	</li>
	<li>
		DPT lasts 2.5hrs at least
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	For me, rectal doses go like this:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Light: 20mg-30mg
	</li>
	<li>
		Medium: 30mg-40mg
	</li>
	<li>
		Heavy: 50mg+
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	I am very sensitive to all psychedelics so your doses may need to higher.
</p>

<p>
	Rubin's show is funded by right wingers as part of their stage Blue/Orange propaganda campaign.
</p>

<p>
	The Koch bros fund media to advance a libertarian capitalist agenda under the guise of free thinking.
</p>

<p>
	It's alongside the absurd PragerU channel and others. They sink millions of ad dollars into it. It's not organic.

<p>
	The point of relativism is that you cannot do that.
</p>

<p>
	Any book you read will claim to be the truth, but it cannot be.
</p>

<p>
	Reality cannot be put into perspective because it is the sum total of all perspectives.

<p>
	Mushrooms, LSD, 5-MeO-DMT, etc.
</p>

<p>
	They're all create for creativity in their own ways.

<p>
	There's a reason artists love to take them. It's like steroids for artists but 1000x stronger.
