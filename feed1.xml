<p>
	There are many different kinds of awakenings even if you're doing it purely sober.
</p>

<p>
	If you include psychedelics, you will get hundreds of different kinds.

			So, do you think that there is absolutely no value in the attention this creates, in order to change the rules of the game? Or that the negative it creates outweighs the positive? How does change happen without attention? This is essentially saying that there needs to be no "marketing" for changes to take place. Sounds naive to me.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I doubt this will create the change you want.
</p>

<p>
	I see this as a sort of virtual riot. And while I understand why people riot and how Wall Street maybe deserves some riots, I'm not really supportive of riots because they are unconscious and get out of control.
</p>

<p>
	In general, I am wary of stage Green mob activities. Although I understand why they happen and perhaps they are necessary in some cases. But they can easily get out of hand. I can't be optimistic about mobs of angry people doing stuff out of spite.

	If the hedge funds were wrong, were they not punished by the market for being wrong about a stock? Anyone shorting Tesla must have lost a ton of money. So what more punishment do they need?

<p>
	Well, it's a tricky situation. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't.
</p>

<p>
	In this case I laughed due to how naive and entitled that position is.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that you should be able to survive without work is one of the most obnoxiously entitled ideas I've ever heard. Only a young Zoomer could believe such things. I don't respect or have sympathy for people who don't want to work.

	Get an RO system which remineralizes the water. Drinking water without minerals is bad. The cost difference is negligible.

<p>
	The idea that some Reddit punks are gonna lead to systemic Wall Street regulation reform is rather silly. The problems with Wall Street are way too big for that. This can only be done with serious Congressional legislation -- for which there is no will.
</p>

<p>
	These Redditors might even end up gaining sympathy for those billionaires from the SEC.

<p>
	Your thinking that hedge funds managers are wrong is also relative.
</p>

<p>
	Shorting stock is also not a crime. Being a billionaire is also not a crime.
</p>

<p>
	Your complaints are that shady stuff is done by rich people which is not technically a crime, but ought to be. Well, this is a two-way street with Reddit.

<p>
	No government cares about bailing out one hedge fund.
</p>

<p>
	But the SEC will certainly care about new market manipulation schemes via social media because it potentially threatens the large market system.
</p>

<p>
	The SEC went after Elon Musk just for one of his tweets! Certainly they will keep a close eye on these Redditors.

<p>
	Neither is shorting stock a crime. So what you complaining about?

<p>
	A) Girls are naturally flaky and detached until sex. This is their advantage in the game. The advantage is quickly lost after sex.

	For me it comes from a place of deep Love, but it is clouded by egoic impurities, fears, bad habits, biases, weaknesses, etc.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course manipulation of markets is going to be regulated. It always has been because markets cannot survive otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	The desire to see markets go unregulated so that they can be manipulated by peasant buffoons as vengeance against Wall Street capitalists is not wise. It will backfire on society. Those same mechanisms will get hijacked by Wall Street execs very shortly.
</p>

<p>
	As tempting as it is, treating Wall Street as some evil or devil will not solve our problems. It's just more of the same culture war stuff that has us chasing our tails.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, your grandma has her retirement savings on Wall Street. And the ones who will end up fucked in this game are not the execs but the peasants.
</p>

<p>
	All forms of market manipulation must be cracked down on, be it peasant or elite.
</p>

Which is why you must screen so hard up front.
</p>

<p>
	Before you get into a relationship you must decide what you want in a partner. In this case, on a scale of 1 to 10, how ambitious do you want him to be? And what is the lowest you're willing to accept?
</p>

<p>
	Once you're already attached to a person it's like you are stuck waist deep in quicksand, you can't think straight.

<p>
	There are ways of doing business without stooping to Jordan Belfort's toxic ways.

<p>
	But sometimes you have to be hyper-pragmatic and willing to break a few eggs. You can't be too nice all the time.

<p>
	Well, if that's true, the ultimate rule in game is this: not everything will make sense. Sometimes a girl is just acting dumb and deserves no further analysis. Don't take too much bullshit from girls. If they are acting weird, move on to the next who will appreciate what you got to offer.
</p>

<p>
	Your attitude should be like this: if this girl is not excited to be in my presence, she doesn't deserve what I got.
</p>

<p>
	Not everything in game is your fault. Have standards. One of my standards is that the girl should be excited about being with me.

<p>
	It's not so complicated. It happens from lack of options and resistance to change. It's a lack of taking responsibility and failure to set boundaries.
</p>

<p>
	Gamers, like women, are unwilling to walk away.
</p>

<p>
	If you as a gamer set a boundary like: If you (the dev) release a half-finished buggy game, I will never buy from you again. The developers would very quickly change their behavior. But since most gamers are fanboys who love to suck the developer's balls, the developers exploit this.
</p>

<p>
	People with high self-esteem don't let themselves get disrespected or exploited. They are willing to walk away. They are nonneedy. Gamers and women tend to be needy. Needy people never get a good deal because they are desperate for crumbs and the other side smells this desperation.
</p>

<p>
	Why was anyone buying CDPR's Cyberpunk Keanu hype? It was obviously marketing hype. If you have a great game, you don't need Keneau to sell it to a bunch of fanboys. This was a classic fanboy grift. Why is it that I was not out there buying Cyberpunk on day one? Because it was obviously over-hyped and needed thorough review.

You are the man! It is your job to make her feel comfortable.
</p>

<p>
	This situation could have been avoided with proper kino escalation. Google kino escalation ladder and follow it next time. You need to get her comfortable with your touch from the first second you meet up with her, otherwise things will get uncomfortable. You also need to charm her with humor, music, etc. And don't give up after one rejected kiss. Just butter her up some more and try the kiss again in 5 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you need to bounce her around to multiple locations. The more locations the better. Don't close at the same location you meet and date.

</p>

<p>
	If you define "mind" as something dual and finite, then by your own definition there will be stuff outside it that controls it.
</p>

<p>
	If you define "mind" as Infinite Mind, then it's is One and nondual and self-governing.
</p>

<p>
	Controller vs controlled is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	When you say, "we are using the mind", what is this magically "we"? Realize that this "we" IS your own Mind!
</p>

<p>
	Mind controls itself like this:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="hansd-drawing.png" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed" data-fileid="32555" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2021_01/hansd-drawing.png.c88947c2bd93a51f4fbf16bdaa0ac973.png" />
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Mind imagines something that it calls "not-mind" and then proceeds to say that that thing caused the mind. Which is like pretending your tail isn't yours but someone else's, so you could enjoy eating it.

Good digital artists will always be in high demand.
</p>

<p>
	There is a huge market for pro digital artists:

<p>
	<a href="https://www.behance.net/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.behance.net</a>
</p>

<p>
	You should be able to comfortably support yourself if you just build up enough skills and a killer portfolio. And formal art training is valuable to have, so it won't be a waste of time if you actually want to do serious art.
</p>

<p>
	If you can get free art training, that's a great option. Just make sure the art training is in some marketable form of art. Digital is the way.

<p>
	Here you're talking about the absolute domain. In the absolute domain You/God are creating everything you see. But the human vehicle is not conscious enough to know how this is happening. So practically the ego-you cannot change physical reality willy-nilly. There are higher orders and forces at play that you cannot control as a human.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a video game. When a game designer plays his own video game, he is limited by his own creation. But if he logs out of the game he has the tools to change the game in any way imaginable. But as long as he's in the game playing the game, he must play by the rules him himself established earlier.
</p>

<p>
	But this thread is not about the absolute domain, so don't confuse things. I was not talking about the absolute here.

			I'm interested how important it is to be highly developed to create a model like SD? I've kinda assumed that people who do that broad unbiased developmental modeling work from above. I'm currently reading Cowan's & Beck's book, but haven't yet deepened into the higher MEMEs, so I want to ask out of curiosity and eagerness; Is SD based on pure psychology on higher stages too? That would probably explain why your Stage Turquoise video was deleted from YT.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You'd be surprised. Strict empirical modeling by itself does not require much development or consciousness. In a sense, a monkey could do it.
</p>

<p>
	Clare Graves scored himself around stage Blue.
</p>

<p>
	It does not take a mystical genius to create SD. But what can happen is that once a non-genius mind creates such a model, it won't have enough intelligence or requisite variety to notice its limits and transcend it. Which is the whole problem with current science. Lots of good empirical science is done but it gets badly misused because proper use requires very high degrees of self-awareness. This is typically what happens when models are made without taking into account the existential, metaphysical, epistemic, and spiritual dimensions. SD misses these crucial aspects hence it will always fall short without being supplemented in ways that Ken Wilber does. Wilber is conscious enough to see these traps, Beck is not. Beck is operating from the materialist paradigm and that will never fully fly, although it's still pretty good. You can get pretty far with materialism, but not far enough.

	Notice this, if you were a fundamentalist Christian and you heard someone else from another worldview talking about God, you would assume they stole it from you and corrupted it to boot. And this would make you righteously pissed off.
</p>

<p>
	That's what paradigm lock does. Everything is interpreted through the lens of that rigid paradigm, creating a lot of distortion and emotional frustration.

<title>Question for guys - Have you ever wanted to be a girl just to be able to give birth?</title>

<p>
	No.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine for moment that you gave birth to a baby not unconsciously, but consciously, by designing every part of its body using your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Well, that's what a creative person does with his life.
</p>

<p>
	Realize this: "baby" is a purely metaphysically-relative notion. Free yourself to create whatever you want by unshackling your mind.
</p>

<title>Did Ken Wilber distort Spiral Dynamics?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/60375-did-ken-wilber-distort-spiral-dynamics/?do=findComment&amp;comment=822408</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<p>
	Wilber has never been interested in any one model. He studies and integrates dozens of models. So the idea that Wilber is somehow hurting Spiral Dynamics is like saying that a philosopher is hurting Christianity by studying other religions. If you are a fundamentalist Christian (Don Beck in this case with SD) then to you it will seem wrong and even evil that people study other religions. But to someone at Tier 2, this criticism is laughable.
</p>

<p>
	"The better the model, the bigger the problem."
</p>

<p>
	The simple fact that Beck devoted his whole life to one model, is his problem.
</p>

<p>
	Most humans don't have any sense of higher purpose. And you won't succeed in convincing them to pick one up. It's not part of their character structure.
</p>

<p>
	The big factor here is ambition. Most people simply aren't ambitious and you will never make them ambitious so stop trying.
</p>

<p>
	Either accept your ambitionless man or leave him and next time screen guys for ambition before sleeping with them.
</p>

<p>
	Ambition is a fundamental character trait of the mind. You're born with it or you're not.
</p>

<p>
	This is not an issue of confidence. It's an issue of ambition.

	If you're already at an advanced level of consciousness and development, then you don't need it from the outside.

</p>

<p>
	Do not just quit your job hoping that things will work out. They won't. You must prove a reliable income stream. THEN you can quit your job.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to income, you must be pragmatic as a motherfucker. No fantasies and wishful thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Where is your income?

Humans are in need of  communities of spiritual and physical  health and ecological sanity. How many leaders have  building that kind of model as a practical goal ?

<p>
	Then what you call "the apocalypse" -- LOL -- has been here for the last 10,000 years. What you or Shunya call the apocalypse is simply the default human condition.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are not really in need of healthy conscious communities because they are themselves unconscious like animals and they have created exactly the kind of community that they are willing to tolerate. If you put the average American in Shunya's community, he will balk and piss all over it and leave. The average American wants Trump not Shunya. The average Americans wants beer and porn and Game of Thrones. Not a spiritual community.
</p>

<p>
	"The apocalypse" -- this current society -- IS what us humans have created because that's what the majority of us want and tolerate. Stop blaming some evil others for it. If you could not create a great community now, don't fool yourself into thinking you will be able to create one in the forest somewhere. Whatever community you create will precisely reflect your level of unconsciousness and selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy for Shunya to create an elite spiritual community when he excludes 99.9999% of all of mankind from it.
</p>

<p>
	The real challenge is how to create a spiritual community that includes the millions of MAGA morons who will call you a pedophile as soon as you tell them anything they don't want to hear.

<p>
	You should realize most things in society do not scale across all of society.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if everyone became a plumber, civilization would die out. But that does not mean there's anything wrong with you pursuing a lucrative plumbing career.
</p>

<p>
	Society requires lots of specialized roles that are not meant to scale.
</p>

<p>
	We don't need 100% entrepreneurs. That would be as stupid as trying to get 100% plumbers or dentists.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Of course! Escaping wage slavery or being a millionaire cannot scale across the whole society by definition.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse my biz advice for national economic policy. My biz advice is geared towards the top 1% of mankind who actually care to be creative.
</p>

<p>
	My advice will never scale across the entire population. And neither will enlightenment. If everyone in society became enlightened civilization would collapse. But this is not a problem because less than 1% even care about enlightenment. Likewise, less than 1% even care about starting a biz, let alone willing to do the necessary work.
</p>

<p>
	None of this makes my biz advice dysfunctional, as you say. It's super functional and helps advance mankind of you do it right.
</p>

<p>
	My biz advice does not contradict starting a co-op. And my advice is not about maximizing profits.
</p>

<p>
	I do not give stage Orange biz advice. But nor does my biz advice fit your utopian Green socialist ideals, since that is nonesense which does not work in the real world.
</p>

<p>
	It is you who is actually tainting the creative process by trying to inject politics into it.
</p>

<p>
	My biz advice is apolitical.
</p>

<p>
	You should also understand that we live within a certain system (capitalism) and you must work within this system, not your fantasies. You can try to change the system, but until that is actualized you're still operating within the old system, and there's no way to escape that.

<p>
	This is actually very untrue.
</p>

<p>
	On the absolute scale most consumer goods get cheaper all the time. If you spend 10% of your income to buy a car today, you will get a product that is 10x better than your daddy would get if he spent 10% of his income on a car back in the 80's.
</p>

<p>
	Certain things like real estate are an exception. Although even when buying a house, the house you get today will be 10x better than a house built in the 1960's.
</p>

<p>
	Today's middle class live better than yesterday's royalty. Yet it's never good enough.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, if you earn low six figures these days, you can live like a king.

<p>
	Do not turn these threads into blind justifications of your survival biases, or I will lock them down.
</p>

<p>
	Ya'll really struggle to discuss gender dynamics without getting all personal and egotistical about it.
</p>

<p>
	Self-reflect before you post your self-biased BS here. This goes for men and women here. You are both guilty of it in your own ways.

His attitudes about work and work-life balance are some of the most toxic possible.
</p>

<p>
	You can find interviews of him where he talks about how miserable his life actually is.
</p>

<p>
	Raw ambition comes with many upsides and downsides. He is busy saving the world from ambitious ego-maniacs and capitalists like himself. Wise it is not.

<p>
	Elon Musk is the perfect example of a very smart stupid person.

<p>
	Depends on what you're cooking. If it's stuff like soup, definately don't use tap.
</p>

<p>
	But even stuff like boiling rice, pasta, potatos, it's pretty dumb to do that for 20 years using tap. Fixing your health will cost thousands. Good R/O system costs $300. They have countertop R/O systems with no drilling.

<p>
	Just so you know what it's like to be a guy, your mind is always automatically scanning for fuckability. This is not something you just decide not to do. And what you so crudely call "fuckability" is just survival value. You, as a woman, are also always scanning for survival value. You just need a different value. So don't for one second think that you're above this sort of this. Your entire life is you scanning for survival value.

<p>
	It's a very dumb thing to do. It will destroy your health and your happiness.
</p>

<p>
	Typical stage Orange toxic mindset.
</p>

<p>
	Studies have been done that show that working beyond 40 hrs per week for more than a few weeks ruins job performance. If Elon Musk worked all his employees 80-100 works per week all his companies would crash and burn in a few years.
</p>

<p>
	He himself can do it because he's not actually doing serious technical work himself. You can't code 80 hrs a week for years on end without disastrous results.
</p>

<p>
	And from a spiritual POV it's dumber than a pile of rocks.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is all about exquisite balance.
</p>

<p>
	If you are starting a project, you are the leader, you are the visionary, and you get paid the big bucks to find that perfect balance for us. If you don't know how to find the right balance then don't be a leader and don't start important projects. Be a sheep who follows someone else who knows how.
</p>

<p>
	This is the paradox of the sheep asking for detailed instructions on how to be a leader.
</p>

<p>
	You have a brain. Use it to pioneer the way. Create something new. That is your job. If we do it for you, then what use are you?

	Unfortunately this isn't true. As we see with 70 million people voting for Trump.
</p>

<p>
	If American citizens were more developed and educated, many government problems would go away. But therein lies the whole problem. How do you develop people who refuse to develop themselves?
</p>

<p>
	People are not educated enough to vote on policy or substance.

	It is good for the utterly self-absorbed bros in this sub-forum to read and see the world through the survival challenges of a woman. Cause most of ya'll are clueless about such things.
</p>

<p>
	It helps to cure some of that whiny victim mentality about not getting laid on a dime.
</p>

<p>
	Too much bro-bias around here.
</p>

<p>
	But ya'll ladies are biased as fuck too in your own unique way.
</p>

<p>
	Hope you're noticing the meta pattern here.

<p>
	You are confusing things.
</p>

<p>
	When I talk about game, I'm talking about offline game. Online should not even be considered game.
</p>

<p>
	I have always said that online is very different and it all hinges on looks.
</p>

<p>
	Not making this distinction is a grave error.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't have above-average looks and you want hot girls you should not be wasting your time online.

			Democrats and Republicans are fundamentally playing for the same team. The differences are there, certainly. And I'd rather have Dems in office for that reason.

		<p>
			But in the most fundamental ways, the "niceness" in their roles as moral leaders is window dressing. Of course, with Trump, we can see that that window dressing and (at least the illusion of) moral leadership matters. But it's still just window dressing.

<p>
	Except it is not mere window dressing, and if Trumpism didn't reveal that you, I don't know what will.

<p>
	It's not an illusion, their niceness just has it's limits and isn't as nice as you desire.

			The real reason why they're always trying to "reach across the aisle" is because Republican legislation benefits their wealthy donors. So, it is Democrats' role to pretend to be for the average person, while being as adaptable and pliable as possible and to mostly concede to Republicans. Where it is Republicans job to get their agendas through by any means necessary... including obstruction.
		</p>

		<p>
			And it's all because this is what benefits their donors. Nothing more.

<p>
	You over-simply things.
</p>

<p>
	This attitude of blame-everything-on-elites is foolish. As we saw with MAGA, the vulgar non-elites are worse than the elites.
</p>

<p>
	If the elites will price gouge you on healthcare, the non-elites will dress like Vikings and rape your grandma for sport.
</p>

<p>
	Elite vs non-elite is not the correct dichotomy. That's not the real issue. The fact is that non-elites are ignorant and they elect idiot politicians who reflect their own idiocy. And THEN those politicians of course exploit and sell them out. Because that's exactly what a non-elite would do if placed in such a position of power.
</p>

<p>
	A non-elite is just an elite who hasn't achieved money and power yet. If you give a non-elite the opportunity to be an elite, he will take it and run with it.

I mean this in contrast with "public space" which is the part of experience that other people seem to know about, or could potentially know about? To explain mind you have to explain this division between private and public.

<p>
	It's elastic. Notice that no matter how easy your life gets, it's still always a struggle and full of suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind creates as much suffering as is needed to fill itself.

	You are trying to reach outside of infinity to define infinity, which is impossible, since everything is infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is undefinable, because any definition you construct will be infinity itself. You see, definition requires duality, but reality is nondual.
</p>

<p>
	When you ask such questions it is like trying to pull yourself out of quicksand by pulling on your own hair.

<title>What is The Mind, really?</title>

<p>
	Everything is the Mind.
</p>

<p>
	Mind is a thing that dreams/imagines. And since it is infinite there is nothing outside of it.
</p>

<p>
	And of course, in strange loop fashion, Mind imagines itself into existence. Which is how God created itself.
</p>

	Just tell her that you don't feel the chemistry with her and it would be unfair to her to continue on.
</p>

<p>
	Don't waste her time with bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	Chemistry and fit is not something that always happens. So get used to saying so.

<p>
	Where would the papers be created if all the space is already taken up by paper?
</p>

<p>
	When you say God or Infinity or Everything, that means it already takes up all possible spaces where anything could be. Since it is everywhere and everything, there cannot be anything beyond it or outside.

	You can draw however many objects you want on a piece of paper, but they are always connected and ONE with the paper.
</p>

<p>
	And since the paper is infinite and has no outside edge, there cannot be two papers.

<p>
	There is an existential conflict.

<p>
	Which is why left and right are not merely polar opposites. One is more conscious than the other.

</p>

<p>
	A) Stop dating girls that young. 25 at least, preferably 30ish. What do you expect from a 19 year old? She'll be as dumb as a coffee table.
</p>

<p>
	B) Of course you should be screening girls on more than just looks. Sacrifice a few points on looks to get a better personality and higher wisdom/maturity. Game can certainly help you with this since it will give you more options and screening is an important part of proper game. The mistake is thinking of a 10 as purely based on looks. 10 means the whole package, which includes personality, education, cognitive development, spiritual development, career, finances, etc. All that stuff matters. Settle for a 7-8 on looks.
</p>

<p>
	C) And of course society's 10 scale is totally irrelevant. Make your own scale.
</p>

<p>
	That would be the goal of consciousness relationship, but a lot of stuff will get in your way. Namely, your own selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	You see, fundamentally what you want is selflessness, but you also refuse to surrender your self. Hence the struggle.

	What you're doing here is not spirituality, it's childishness. And this attitude is gonna fuck you up real bad in life.
</p>

<p>
	There are many ways to misunderstand and twist spirituality to serve the ego.
</p>

<p>
	Spoiling your mind to believe you deserve that which you did not work for is one of the most toxic attitudes you can develop in life.

	If Dems weren't nice, then they wouldn't be any better than Repubs.
</p>

<p>
	That's the paradox.
</p>

<p>
	On the one hand you want leaders who are decent and loving, and yet you want them to also savage your enemies, which is the whole source of your wanting decency to begin with.

<p>
	That's basically how game works.
</p>

<p>
	You can effectively boost yourself from a 5 to a 9, batting way above your league.
</p>

<p>
	The great thing about being a man is that you can go from a 5 to a solid 10 if you really want. A woman cannot do that. Which is why women don't game. If game worked for women, they would do it. Which is why all women wear makeup. Makeup is the original photoshop.
</p>

<p>
	Online game should not even be called "game". It's not game. It's just lazy posting of photos of yourself.

I see many members here who simply follow your teachings rationally and end up believing some silly notion, such as for example, the word 'fight' must always mean Red, or the word 'peace' must always mean Green (no pun intended).

<p>
	That's because you have a shallow understanding of the stages. Blue is not a bad stage. It's absolutely crucial to success in life. You will never succeed in life without the discipline and work ethic of Blue.
</p>

<p>
	It's not Yellow or Turquoise. Again, your calibration is lacking. Just because it has visualizations or spiritual concepts does not make it 2nd Tier.

	It all depends on what you want in return. If you want the hottest girls, yes. If you're okay with average girls, then no.
</p>

<p>
	You're always trading value. And in online game the value being traded is only looks. No other value. In offline game you have a lot more to trade with.
</p>

<p>
	Stop expecting high value for free. That is madness.

<p>
	That's it. You will get girls messaging you with stuff like, "Hey there cutie! Here's my number."
</p>

<p>
	What your profile says is completely irrelevant. So don't waste time on it.
</p>

<p>
	Try it.

			Most importantly i thought they would go out with you for coffee first (like a few of the girls there suggested) before fucking. I thought girls would not casually fuck a guy unless they were emotionally stimulated in the moment (girls do shit based on emotions). Those girls were acting like legit horny guys.

<p>
	Girls hook up online all the time. And they hook up offline too. Girls play games. They act like they are not sluts but in reality they will sleep with a guy they like extremely quickly. But they will never admit it publicly.

<title>Online dating destroying the principles of game</title>

<p>
	Nothing you say in online game matters. It's 100% looks. If you got the looks you don't need to try to open her with clever lines or game her. All you gotta do is say, "Hi, I'm _____ . What's your number?"
</p>

<p>
	And no amount of clever texting is gonna get her to like you if your looks suck, so don't waste your time.
</p>

<p>
	If a girl has an active online account obviously she's interested in sex.
</p>

<p>
	Offline game is very different because the girl often isn't even actively trying to date and the competition is way less.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with online game is that it's so explicit and lazy that the competition is too steep. You have no edge. There is no reason why the girl would not select the hottest guy she can see. Zero reason. Offline game is totally different because she has way fewer options. She cannot compare you to 100 other guys. Don't put yourself into a position where she can compare you to 100 other guys. This is a losing position. You might as well bend over and let her stick a carrot in your ass while you're at it.
</p>

<p>
	Again, you are fantasizing about some future condition.

<p>
	In reality your yoga studio will close one day and you will be pissy, not magically happy.

	If you want to be happy, start practicing it now.

<p>
	The problem with that is: if you aren't able to do your yoga poses you will be unhappy.
</p>

<p>
	Can you see that God had to make happiness conditional on nothing? Otherwise God would be an asshole.
</p>

<p>
	Stop trying to make an asshole of God.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite happiness requires nothing but the surrender of looking elsewhere.

	It's gonna be a long painful transition from Red/Blue to Orange before Green can flourish there.

<p>
	Russia lacks widespread accessible Orange for average people. They need to ramp up their economy into tech and other stuff like that. Russia could potentially be very good at tech type work.

<p>
	This is extremely common.
</p>

<p>
	In reality many people are not 100% straight but they suppress it so deeply that they don't even know it because our culture so stigmatizes bi-sexuality. People are sheep and rarely want to go against cultural norms. The norms are so deeply internalized they are not felt as norms but as physical reality.
