<p>
	We already have that. There are 100s of people akin to Jesus alive and teaching today.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru is one obvious example of a modern day Jesus type. And there are hundreds of others. It's just that everyone takes such people for granted. The only reason you put Jesus on a pedestal is because of a relentless 2000 year old marketing campaign. Jesus got $50 trillion dollars worth of free marketing. Good luck competing with that.

<p>
	There actually is almost no historical evidence.
</p>

<p>
	The only evidence of Jesus is from the Bible and the various Gospels, none of which are objective or strictly historical records.
</p>

<p>
	Atheists don't doubt it because they are materialists and they don't understand how mystical teachings could be transmitted through highly metaphorical teachings. To an atheist the easiest explanation for Jesus was that he was some cult leader or charlatan.

	A) He might just be a myth assembled from many other such myths common in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
</p>

<p>
	or
</p>

<p>
	B) He might have been a super-naturally gifted mystic what was born with a very high state of baseline consciousness. If he did exist, I don't think he was an ordinary enlightened human. He was in a state of consciousness inaccessible to 99.9999% of humans.

<p>
	Because when such things are organized they are easily abused and turn into cults because they are not moderated or supervised.
</p>

<p>
	You are free to meet up with people you meet on this forum through PM. But don't organize any large gatherings publicly. I know plenty of people meet up one on one through PM connections. That is fine. The risk there is on you.

This will require additional awakenings.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than trying to grasp at straws, it's best to simply admit that you simply do not have a direct experience or God or Love. That's okay to admit. It is better to work from a blank slate than some twisted ideas and vague speculations.

			Please contemplate how far you take this. For example it is not (yet) true for me that God is love. And thats one of your core teachings. Would you ban me if i posted a thread giving arguments against God is love? You locked a thread from a guy who said God does not exist. Is spiritually disagreeing with you considered troll behavior? If so I don’t think the title “self-improvement forum” is appropriate anymore. That would be too broad if you are narrowing your forum down to your core teachings. Just sayin.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can question the topics of God or Love if you are genuinely confused about them and desire to learn and to seek further clarification. But if you are going to take a denialist attitude that God and Love are BS, then you will eventually be banned because I'm not going to entertain such pig-headedness.
</p>

<p>
	God and Love are so fundamental to my teachings that if you disagree with me on these things, you should not be following my work.

<p>
	So.....
</p>

<p>
	After years of running this forum and watching things unfold, I have come to a firm decision that what this place has been lacking from the very beginning is a high bar for quality. People who join here get the impression that since this is a "public" forum, they should be free to spout whatever nonsense their ego wants. They get the impression that this forum is just like any other dumping ground on the internet. Well, not any more.
</p>

<p>
	My initial attitude towards this forum was to moderate as little as possible and to be as lenient as possible, treating everyone with kid gloves and giving them many second-chances to correct themselves. Unfortunately, people who post crap are usually people who are incapable of correcting themselves. It's become clear to me now that such a permissive attitude drags down the quality of the entire forum and makes this place unappealing for my most serious students. It is also a giant waste of time to deal with.
</p>

<p>
	So, from now on, this forum will not only be moderated for all the basic, common-sense guidelines which are necessary to keep an online community from turning into a toxic troll-hive, we are going one step further to moderate for quality. Posters who are unable to demonstrate a certain moderate level of ego maturity and show a certain moderate level of post quality will now be banned. The bottom line is this: to be a member of this forum is to be part of a special class of human who is able to conduct him/herself with a certain maturity, wisdom, openness of mind, humility, intellectual honesty, kindness, compassion, thoughtfulness, and well-spokenness. The kind work we do here requires a relatively high level of maturity which, unfortunately, many in the general online population are just not capable of -- and as of today we will no longer be accommodating to such people. There are plenty of places on the internet where such people can congregate. Actualized.org should not be one of them.
</p>

<p>
	I've updated our <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/guidelines/" rel="">Forum Guidelines</a> to reflect this. Please read and adhere to them. It's really not too much to ask. Our Mods will now be keeping an eye out for low quality posts and immature posters, issuing more warnings and bans than before. But if you are a mature and thoughtful member here, you shouldn't have anything to worry about. I know 90% of folks here are good folks and post quality stuff. It's the bottom 10% that we want to cull. So just don't be that guy.
</p>

<p>
	Thank you for your support. Let's raise the bar and make this the best community for serious self-actualization work.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Of course I will be accused of "censorship" by some for this decision. So be it. Quality stuff doesn't happen without filters. For every troll or ignoramus that we allow here, we lose at least one serious member who doesn't have time to deal that shit. By being too lax, it's the best members who end up punished.
</p>

<p>
	Trump had already gotten those sweet biz deals from the Russians long ago. Russians were buying most of his overpriced apartments and condos, effectively laundering money through him.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's entire real estate biz was a money laundering scheme.

</p>

<p>
	It's very common.
</p>

<p>
	As you do inner work, as you improve your self-esteem, as you erect healthy boundaries with men, as you become more conscious -- your relationships with men will become a lot better. If not, they won't.

	If there was something other than Consciousness, then ONENESS would be broken.

<p>
	You can probe deeper into Consciousness to realize that its true nature is nothing/emptiness. But that is still Consciousness as I conceive of it. It is Consciousness realizing its own nature through self-reflection.

<p>
	This is a very simplistic and reductionistic perspective.
</p>

<p>
	You transcend the mind and body, but the mind and body is still a huge part of your human incarnation.
</p>

<p>
	Not taking care of your body and mind, being addicted, being broke -- these things will strengthen ego and make you miserable.
</p>

<p>
	At your current stage -- which I can tell isn't very high -- I would worry less about transcendence and more about mastering basic survival, so you are a fully-functioning and mature ego.
</p>

<p>
	Then you can shift focus to transcendence. You will simply not be capable of transcending if your ego is underdeveloped.

Do you see Art, Programming, and other mediums like those just as tools to develop something? Do you see a value in learning for example web development just for its sake? I mean, isn't what you develop more important than the tools you use?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's the point having a clear life purpose. So you can know what your mission is and what are the tools and means by which to get there.
</p>

<p>
	I would definitely not put the medium as my life purpose. The medium is just one expression of my life purpose. This gives you the flexibility to change mediums while staying on purpose, and finding the medium which is more conducive to the fulfillment of your purpose.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, some people just fucking love art or programming for its own sake. And there's nothing wrong with that per se, Your purpose might be to just explore the craft of art or programming your entire life.

			I'm asking that because currently, I work as a web developer in a company, but from childhood (I'm 24 now), I also loved art and played with Graphics software and drew well too (I draw sometimes even today). Now I'm torn between those two domains because if I transition from a developer's position and start learning Art and Graphics, I'd struggle financially, lose a couple of years of coding experience, network of people, etc. I also like what I'm doing right now, but I also want to do much more <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" /> I think a life lived in coding 8-10 hours a day is a waste...

			I think you make some bold career transitions in your life.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Sounds like you answered your own question there.
</p>

<p>
	Follow your passion, despite the short-term costs. Of course there will be short-term costs to transitions careers/domains/mediums. But in the long-term you will win by following your heart, which seems to be art.
</p>

<p>
	You can find gradual and strategic ways to transitions such that you don't immediately just quit your day job.
</p>

<p>
	Art and programming also happen to dovetail so well that you can easily create an niche which is a 50/50 blend of the two. Technical artists can be highly valued and well-paid. Dev teams badly need technical artists. You can either turn this into your end-goal, or it could just be a stepping stone towards a full transition into art some years later. There's plenty of flexibility here.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest thing you should fear is wasting your life doing things your heart isn't into.

<p>
	Of course it depends on how you define your terms. But I don't like the term "energy". People like to throw that term around without any clear sense or definition of what it means. They use it in a wishy-washy way, where energy can mean anything.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you mean by energy, it is an aspect of consciousness. You are conscious of energy. So consciousness holds "energy" inside itself, so to speak.
</p>

<p>
	I prefer the term consciousness rather than energy. The nice thing about the term consciousness is that it already implies that consciousness can be less or more conscious. That's just baked into what consciousness is and does. Just like how light can be less or more intense. Nobody thinks of light as a static thing. We think of light in terms of various intensities.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is light, doesn't guarantee its very intense light.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	In theory you would learn it more comprehensively in a formal art school.
</p>

<p>
	But this not strictly necessary. You can also teach much of it to yourself. But you'll have to put in the time and energy.
</p>

<p>
	There is a significant difference between formal art training vs simply watching 3DsMax tutorials. Technical software skills are NOT art fundamentals.
</p>

<p>
	I have a good grasp of 3DsMax and Photoshop, but I have very little grasp of art fundamentals. Which is why I'm not a great artist. But I can model a dragon in 3DsMax. But it won't be an awesome work of art. Hence studios would be fools to hire me as a 3D artist.
</p>

<p>
	For me to become a great artist I would need serious formal art training. Not just some online software tutorials. To be a great artist you must study the aesthetics of life: form, shape, lines, curves, colors, composition, symmetry, light, shadow, objects, anatomy, etc.
</p>

<p>
	What then remains is any number of different states of consciousness, from infinitely low to infinitely high and anything in between.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you are confusing a house for its state of cleanliness. Just because you have a perfectly clean house does not tell you anything about the kind of house it is. It could a clean rickety shack or a clean marble palace.

<p>
	This is incorrect, since there is nothing but states of consciousness. To say that something is consciousness means to say that it is in some state of consciousness. This state could be low or high or any infinite shades in between.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be "no states of consciousness". Even if consciousness is formless or empty, that too is a state of consciousness. The null state. And by definition a rock is not a null state, otherwise you wouldn't call it a rock.

<p>
	No, this doesn't follow at all. It means a very contracted, limited state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible for you to become a rock and experience what it feels like to exist as a rock. This will not be Infinite Consciousness. It will be a very narrow, finite consciousness. Although it may feel like it lasts forever, since a rock doesn't have a sense of time.
</p>

<p>
	Smoke some salvia and you can know what it feels like to become a rock. But be careful what you wish for.

<p>
	No. There are an infinite number of different and valid ways to express yourself and help raise the consciousness of mankind.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming a monk is only for the most hardcore people who REALLY deeply want that kind of lifestyle. If you want to be a monk you should feel it resonate in your bones.

Anatomy, sculpture, drawing, color theory, composition, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The most impressive thing Art Directors look for when hiring 3D artists is whether they have that traditional artistic knowledge. Since that is hardest to teach. They care less about your technical software skills. Although of course technical software skills are important to develop your portfolio. But what you should really highlight is your understanding of traditional art, anatomy, and form. If you can demonstrate a solid classical understanding of art, you shouldn't have a problem getting hired and even trained on the job in new software.
</p>

<p>
	Be a good artist first, and a 3D artist second. Because good art is the foundation for good 3D art.
</p>

<p>
	When you try to pitch yourself to employers, don't lead with your technical skills, lead with your fundamental mastery of your craft, whether that be art, programming, design, business, or whatever. Demonstrate that you have a solid understanding of the fundamentals of your sub-field. Demonstrate mastery and excellent grasp of your sub-field. Then your technical skills are the cherry on top.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, this assumes too much. You assume a perfect correlation between surrender and consciousness, which just isn't the case. There is some correlation in general, but it's far from perfect. You can be in a state of zero self/ego, but still not be infinitely conscious.
</p>

<p>
	A rock has no self/ego. It is fully surrendered. But it is not very conscious at tall.
</p>

<p>
	You guys keep conflating all these different facets and dimensions of consciousness, and that's because you haven't deeply explored all the various states that consciousness can take on. Hence your view of consciousness is very one-dimensional. It's sort of like the difference between someone who's lived in one country his whole life vs someone who's traveled the world. If you ask the one-country guy about how the world is, he will give you a very narrow picture based on his little corner of the world which he has assumed is the same everywhere else. If you ask the word-traveler, he will regale you weird tails of alien and unbelievable cultures that will hardly make any sense because you had to be there to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	Teachings like Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta make consciousness seem very one-dimensional. Because that's all you get through meditation and self-inquiry. You can't shift your consciousness significantly enough via those methods. Hence you end up confusing the limits of those methods with the limits of consciousness itself. Which is a great delusion.

<p>
	If you want the truly ultimate stage, it is an Infinite Singularity of Consciousness/Love that increases endlessly without end, forever.
</p>

<p>
	It is a ONENESS so complete that the entire universe is extinguished forever into a infinite field of pure indifference.
</p>

<p>
	The final stage is simply:
</p>

<p>
	INFINITY/LOVE

<p>
	Consciousness expands and contracts. You mistakenly give power of the contraction to ego vs consciousness. Consciousness has all the power, not the ego. Consciousness contracts to create ego, not the other way around. The power to awaken or to forget is that of Consciousness alone.

			You are contradicting yourself here, Leo, because I know for a fact that you have a dream of being in a "state of God-consciousness" (5-MeO/DMT-like) 24/7. So in that sense you are searching for a specific permanent condition, although you may 'externally' have given up on it as of late. Of course, the search itself is probably the reason it ain't already the case; God's favorite game in town: hide'n'seek.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, I am speaking from the POV of Truth. From the POV of Truth it makes no difference how long a thing lasts. A lightening bolt is as true is as the moon. Ironically it is the ego-mind which gives higher value to permanent things than to temporary ones.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the ego would love to live in a constantly high state. But that is irrelevant from the POV of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously expanding one's consciousness makes one feel more powerful, since Power = Infinite Consciousness. This is not a problem, it's a feature of God. I do not seek higher consciousness to gain more power. I seek higher consciousness for its own sake, and any power that comes from that pursuit is merely a happy side-effect.

The more conscious a ego becomes, the more it values consciousness in itself.

<p>
	Again, this is to grossly oversimplify things.
</p>

<p>
	God is Consciousness and it desires to be conscious of itself. You can call it a "game" if you want, but it's the only game in town and this "game" is what God IS. Trying to dissuade God from playing this game is foolish since there's nothing better to do and it amounts to self-denial. God denying God in the name of God.

In the same way, if you *could* eradicate ego, it would mean eradicating God, which of course isn't possible.

<p>
	Wrong. Ego is not always the case. There are states of consciousness with absolutely zero ego. Whether it is realistic or practical to live from such a place is irrelevant from the POV of Truth and Consciousness.

<p>
	But notice, although you speak of not playing the game, here you are still playing the game. If you were truly infinitely conscious you would not be here in human form. The very fact that you are in a human form is proof that you are not willing to surrender the playing of the game. You are merely pretending to not be playing the game when you are fully involved in it.
</p>

<p>
	And the reason you're doing this is because you are not infinitely consciousness. You're stuck in lower consciousness while telling yourself you've "arrived", that you're "done". Well, you're kidding yourself.

<p>
	Yes, God of course. But here's the point: You don't understand what God is until you've actually been infinitely conscious.

<p>
	Yes, but you are not fully conscious of what consciousness is or can do.
</p>

<p>
	A rock is consciousness/God, but it is not infinitely conscious of itself as that. Neither is a human.
</p>

<p>
	You can be a rock if you want. A rock is surrendered and liberated. But it ain't conscious of much.
</p>

<p>
	To me this work is not about becoming a rock. But it seems that's what you want to make this work into. Well, enjoy being a rock. But don't expect me to join you in that.

	That's nationalism for ya in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
	Ironic how today's Israelis behave like Nazis.
</p>

<p>
	People get lost in the content differences while not seeing the structural similarities. The problem with Nazis was not their content but their structure.

<p>
	You don't need to be programmer to do game dev. There are many other roles:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Producer
	</li>
	<li>
		Designer
	</li>
	<li>
		Level design
	</li>
	<li>
		Art
	</li>
	<li>
		Audio
	</li>
	<li>
		PR/marketing/sales
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	The way to break into games is simple: you work on your own little projects, building up skills, and developing a solid, polished portfolio which you then show off to employers. Attending game's conferences like GDC and networking with your portfolio in-hand can open many doors.
</p>

<p>
	Starting game design is easier than ever today thanks to powerful and cheap tools like Unity, Unreal, or many of the modding toolkits like that of Skyrim, Fallout, or other games.
</p>

<p>
	One of the easiest ways to get hired is to create a solid and popular mod for a popular game like Fallout/Skyrim. As new games are released, start modding them and posting your work for fans to give you feedback and reviews. Designing board games or pen and paper games is also a good way to build up your design skills.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, as long as you have the skills and can demonstrate them, you will get hired. The trick is developing the skills. This requires some years of committed work and a plan.
</p>

<p>
	I could write an entire course on how to become a top notch game designer and get hired by the best studios.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There's no way forward in life so long as your mind is full of those recirculating toxic beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	I had to do a lot of busting of my limiting beliefs when I was starting out in this work.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, your potential in life is so monstrously huge that your mind will not believe it is real. It sounds too much like a pipe dream. The mind needs to be whipped into opening itself.

	After detox I went from sleeping 9 hours and feeling tired to sleeping 6.5-7 hours and feeling energetic. It can make a huge difference.

<p>
	That's what happens when you start to self-actualize. You see more and more how much time and potential you squandered by doing other useless shit like a monkey.
</p>

<p>
	That deep regret is a sign of you becoming more conscious. Most people are so asleep they never even know what they missed. They live and die in blissful ignorance.

Knowing how to flirt and charm a girl will not help you in other areas of your life much. Confidence humor and not being a wimp will though
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Of course it's both.
</p>

<p>
	There are many technical aspects of game if you want to get really good. But there are also general principles of being more attractive and high value as a man. Ideally you master both.
</p>

<p>
	No amount of high value will help you if you cannot do such a simple technical feat as open your mouth and talk to girl you've never met before, and do it in a charming, non-creepy, non-panicked way.

<p>
	It's gonna be very tough to fine client unless you have connections within the self-help industry.
</p>

<p>
	That can be a long-term goal of yours, but I don't see how it will be immediately viable because people who need self-help websites is very narrow and specialized. How you gonna find such people. You need a lead-building strategy for that to work.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to niche in web development, I would look for a niche which is lucrative and has lots of demand. Like e-commerce or the like. This way you can bootstrap your biz. Later you can try to transition it to self-help if that's your jazz.

	That is most true with materialistic stage Orange girls. Hippie girls are often more savvy, looking for soulmates and such.

			Are you sure about that? Here are some examples of things that happened to me in the past few months:<br />
			 
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Have been going to a sort of stage green connection building / spirituality events that used to be held in my city every week pre - covid. Never went there with any intention other than to enjoy myself, nor have I ever deliberately "tried" to get a girl from there. Ended up in bed with 5 different girls I've met there.
			</li>
			<li>
				Went to a riverside campfire party a friend invited me to, about 10 people. As it ended and everyone was about to leave, I've asked if I could crash at anyone's place for the night. One girl invited me over. We have talked for a bit during the party and got along pretty well, but it wasn't particularly remarkable or even flirty, just some friendly chats. While on the way to her place, we have been talking a bit more, just a friendly conversation, not flirty or sexy in any way. After we arrived at her place, we laid down in bed next to each other. We started cuddling for a bit, 5 minutes fast forward, and we started to have amazing sex
			</li>
			<li>
				I am a member of a Facebook Self-help group for people who are trying to start a spiritual business. Members regularly connect with each other to help each other out in their business-building and personal growth processes. Had a video call with another female member of the group. Guess what happened 2 weeks later.
			</li>
			<li>
				Member of another Facebook Self-help group for dealing with specific emotional issues. Same story.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			At this point, I don't even care about getting girls at all anymore. They just keep stumbeling into my life unexpectedly every now and then, without me having to put any efford into it. <br />
			<br />
			But it haven't always been like that. I used to be extremely shy, and was only able to talk to girls at all whilst drunk, and was very depressed about that fact. <br />
			Well I've startet trying to improve in that for a little while. I've watched some of yours and other peoples videos, and I went to two workshops. A little bit of improvement happened, but not to the degree where I was even remotely satisfied.<br />
			<br />
			Then what happened is, I did some mushrooms and became conscious of the fact that me desperately wanting to have sex all the time is only causing me pain and lots of it. SO just like that, I startet valuing my mental and emotional health more than sex. So while still having a strong desire for sex within, I just stopped caring about that desire actually getting fulfilled or not. <br />
			Then, the stuff mentioned above started to happen. Magic! <img alt="9_9" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/rolleyes.gif" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/rolleyes@2x.png 2x" title="9_9" width="20" />
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, that is a kind of action-taking
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, it seems you are fairly natural with girls. Some people have it much harder, requiring more effort. If you have above average looks and social skills, attracting girls can be effortless. But not everyone is so lucky.
</p>

<p>
	And also, don't confuse luck with skill.
</p>

	I don't need any human interfering with my inner work. It's like giving up the intimacy of sex to have sex in the parking lot with 20 people watching and giving commentary. No thanks.

<title>Is DMSA a supplement or a drug?</title>

<p>
	From what I have found, DMSA + ALA + zeolite is the best and most proven combo.
</p>

<p>
	Cilantro, chlorela, and spirulina are also said to be good, but probably not as powerful as the above.

<p>
	Which is why urine tests need to done provoked with DMSA and ALA. Then you can see how much is being pulled from your organs.
</p>

<p>
	You can do one urine test unprovoked, and a second one provoked. The difference between them will show you how much is coming out of your organs.

	But as that research link says, mercury from fish seems to not pass the blood-brain barrier. Not sure if I fully trust that. But that's what it says.

			Metal fillings contain elemental mercury. Poorly absorbed, mostly excreted and the daily dose you get is absolutely negligible compared to things like canned tuna containing high amounts of methyl-mercury. This form is readily absorbed, may even cross the blood-brain barrier and wreak havoc in your brain.  
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	Elemental mercury is highly dangerous, more so than methyl-mercury for the brain. Methyl-mercury cannot cross the blood-brain barrier while elemental mercury can. Elemental mercury does, however, have low bio-availability if ingested. But mercury can be inhaled, not just ingested since mercury gives off fumes. Metal fillings aren't so much ingested as they give off fumes. So metal fillings are a very serious problem if you got them.

<title>Insight: Consciousness Cannot Suffer</title>

<p>
	It's more accurate to frame it as: consciousness can suffer, but it doesn't have to.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is just one of an infinite number of things that can be held within consciousness, like the color red, or a bird, or time. Consciousness can hold it, or not hold it.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that Trumpists think Trump does anything out of altruism -- "for the good of the people" -- rather than to increase his ego, is laughable.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's only motivation, ever, is whatever most benefits him personally.

<p>
	That's far too narrow a view. To become an attractive man you shouldn't put "getting laid" as your highest priority.
</p>

<p>
	Build an attractive lifestyle which YOU are in love with. This will attract women.

<p>
	That's because I hesitate to give advice to women because, 1) I am biased in this area, 2) I don't have experience dating as a woman.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you asking a dude for lady dating advice? Ask an experienced lady.
</p>

<p>
	You can easily re-tune that list for women if you sit down and contemplate it a bit. This isn't rocket science.

<p>
	I am not talking about physical strength.
</p>

<p>
	And, sure, you can always get lucky by accident. I am talking about developing oneself in to a strong man. The benefits of this go far beyond simply getting girls.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you could get laid easily as is, you do not want to be a weak man.
</p>

<p>
	Your guys' thinking on this topic is far too narrow. As if getting laid is all that matters. What matters more is how powerful you are in the way you live your life.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't muster the courage to approach a girl, how the fuck are you gonna live a powerful life? You will be just as weak in other areas of your life.

	If your fillings are metal, you should get them replaced with ceramic before doing chelation. Otherwise you could really damage your body as chelation will move metal from your fillings into your brain and organs.

	Yes, no different than if you were a man in a conservative small town, and started saying you're a woman.

	Trump is 1000% uglier in private than in public and stories of his private ugliness will leak out for decades to come. But none of it will convince Trumpists.
</p>

<p>
	By this point, any decent person understands that Trump is rotten to the core and a menace to democracy.

<p>
	Nothing. It just takes some courage and confidence in yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't muster the courage to even walk up and introduce yourself, why on earth would she ever let you inside her legs? A weak guy like you doesn't deserve a hot girl.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to become a strong guy. Strong guys get hot girls.
</p>

<p>
	When you want something in life, you have to be willing to work your ass off for it. Amazing shit is not just gonna land in your lap. You must BUILD what you want. Do you want to be a strong guy? Then BUILD it! Don't ask "But how?" Just get started.

<p>
	There too many ways to list them all:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Grooming better
	</li>
	<li>
		Dressing better
	</li>
	<li>
		Having a strong sense of life purpose and direction
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing charisma
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing humor
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing confidence, leadership skills, speaking skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Earning money, becoming successful, reputable, famous
	</li>
	<li>
		Building a social circle of cool and positive friends
	</li>
	<li>
		Being more social
	</li>
	<li>
		Gaining experience with women
	</li>
	<li>
		Doing pickup & cold approach
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing flirting skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving your vocal tone and body posture
	</li>
	<li>
		Going to the gym and shaping up your body
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving your diet
	</li>
	<li>
		Building an amazing life for yourself
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing amazing sexual skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing emotional connection and your feminine side
	</li>
	<li>
		Meditation & consciousness work
	</li>
	<li>
		Self-love and self-acceptance
	</li>
	<li>
		Developing misc skills such at: cooking, home repair, home defense, sewing, arts & crafts, martial arts, yoga, photography, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Becoming a good human being
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving your communication skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Improving your relationship skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Learning, reading, knowledge
	</li>
	<li>
		Building an awesome bachelor pad/home that will make a girl wet just from walking in
	</li>
	<li>
		Traveling around the world
	</li>
	<li>
		And more...
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You could invest 10 years of full time work developing all that.
</p>

<p>
	None of it is necessary to get laid, but all of it ups your value.
</p>

<p>
	Bottom line: become awesome, and awesome people will gravitate towards you. Or stay lame, and lame people will gravitate towards you. But don't expect to have awesome people in your life while you're lame and too lazy to change yourself. A lazy, sloppy, victim attitude instantly makes you repulsive, since you are a value-leech, expecting something for nothing. If you want something special you must be eager to work for it.

<p>
	Of course!

<p>
	You act like this is some special handicap unique to you.
</p>

<p>
	Literally EVERY guy struggles with this. Even experienced PUAs still get approach anxiety on their first few sets of the night. That's why warm up sets are so important, and building up state.
</p>

<p>
	You really need to watch some old school RSD videos circa 2012, where all this is explained and addressed.
</p>

<p>
	There is no trick to overcoming this problem. You must do hundred of approaches by facing your fears. You will realize all your fears are illusions. But no amount of logic will resolve this. Only approaching will.
</p>

<p>
	You overcome it by realizing you're being a pussy, and by forcing yourself to approach regardless of how you feel.

<title>The Allure Of Identity</title>

<p>
	If there are 70 different genders, you can certainly choose to be whatever race you want.
</p>

<p>
	In theory, there's no reason why a white person couldn't identify with being more black than white. Rapper like Eminem comes to mind. If a white guy grows up in the hood, immersed in black culture, then he's probably more black than white at the level of the mind.

<p>

<p>
	Exactly. Tradeoffs.
</p>

<p>
	It is every girl's dream to catch a player and lock him down.
</p>

<p>
	Well, it's playing with fire. Maybe you can lock him down, maybe you can't. Depends on what you're offering.
</p>

<p>
	Dating is a sort of market auction system where buyers and sellers have to meet each other's value propositions.
</p>

<p>
	The better you make yourself the higher your bids can be. The key, as with other areas of life, is to bring massive value to the negotiating table. Then you can get what you want. But most people are too lazy to up their value. They want to leech value.

So if a guy seems too smooth to be true, how do you think he got that smooth?
</p>

<p>
	Non-player guys are gonna be more reserved, more shy, more awkward, slower, not as sexy or charming, not as charismatic, not as funny, more plain and boring.

	You're still super young and no one will care about your age. What employers care about is your demonstrable skill set and portfolio.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to get hired as an artist, all you need is a great portfolio. You don't even need a degree and your age is irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	All of your attention should be focused on building your skills and putting together a jaw-dropping portfolio.
</p>

<p>
	Artists get hired solely on their portfolios.

</p>

<p>
	Find what lights you up.
</p>

<p>
	A masters degree is not gonna guarantee you any jobs. To get good jobs you must build a solid portfolio and marketable skills. Not degrees.
</p>

<p>
	You can get a temporary job now while you figure out your true passions.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need an MA in economics to find a decent job.

<p>
	Being successful in your life purpose can make it much easier to meet new people through your reputation, status, expertise, celebrity, etc.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you are a semi-successful musician or actor or public speaker, it will be very easy to get laid simply because of how visible you are.

<p>
	How often you get laid is directly proportional to how many new people are seeing you.

<p>
	It is a fact that you can be more conscious than you currently are.
</p>

<p>
	End of story.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone is in the present moment, but that doesn't mean everyone is equally conscious of it.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sick of arguing against this neo-Advaita over-simplified shit which refuses to acknowledge differences in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you are surrendered to the present moment does not mean you are deeply conscious of anything.
</p>

<p>
	What I care about is CONSCIOUSNESS, not surrender and not liberation and not freedom from suffering and not lack of ego and not some permanent condition. But CONSCIOUSNESS!
</p>

<p>
	It makes no difference to me how long it lasts or what its consequences are.

<p>
	Not really. They tend to be anti-addictive.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, if you are irresponsible, anything can be psychologically addictive. But it is not physically addictive at all and it has no withdrawal.
</p>

<p>
	Don't do anything just because you hear me talking about it. You must feel compelled to do it of your own volition, not because someone tells you to.

<p>
	No, I'm just saying that you can hook a girl whilst being a deadbeat. This happens all the time because girls don't get attracted by your money or job, they get attracted to how much you emotionally stimulate them.
</p>

<p>
	You can emotionally stimulate a girl without a job, or whilst having an amazing job. Of course having an amazing job makes you more of a long-term catch and gives you even higher value. But you can still appear high value without a job at all if you're very charismatic, for example.

<p>
	Sounds like you're simply conscious of what God and Love are.
</p>

<p>
	God is everything that exists. Love is everything that exists.
</p>

<p>
	If it exists, it is God/Love. Hence rape is God/Love.
</p>

<p>
	Don't you find it odd that you believe that God created the universe, and yet you somehow think God didn't create rape???
</p>

<p>
	If God didn't create rape, who did?

<p>
	There are many degrees of infinity.
</p>

<p>
	And they are worth accessing.
</p>

<p>
	If you are interested in Consciousness, then reaching higher degrees of infinity is something you should be interested in.
</p>

<p>
	You can discover ever deeper layers to how reality is constructed. This is not just chasing states. This is profound, life-changing stuff. This is a pursuit for those who actually care to understand how reality works at the deepest levels.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation may be one thing, but understanding is something else.

	I bet that a lot of professional women in their 30's and 40's who work boring corporate jobs but make good salaries would kill to have a player boyfriend who fucks her real good and provides her an outlet to be playful and go on adventures.

<p>
	Girls just wanna have fun and feel their feminine side. Which the proper guy can do for her. That's when she falls hard in love, and he can then exploit her emotional soft spot for him.

<p>
	DARE program was not about educating truth about drugs. DARE was a program to demonize drugs and indocrinate abstinence.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between sex abstinence programs vs proper sex ed and handing out free condoms and free birth control and free STD tests. And actually teaching how to have high quality, deep sex.
</p>

<p>
	It is insane that we do not teach teens how to have high quality sex! Truly the Dark Ages.

But it's also not entirely right.
</p>

<p>
	I gurantee you are nowhere close to infinitely conscious. So this thing you call "enlightenment", or just being in the present moment, is limited stuff. It's weak sauce consciousness that seems ultimate just because you know nothing higher.
</p>

<p>
	If you are incarnated as a living being, you are finite. And no amount of fancy talk about how present you are will change that.
</p>

<p>
	On your state of consciousness hinges everything. Don't go thinking you are above states. You ain't. You are stuck in a state at all times. An extremely limited state.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully awoke, you would cease to exist in that body. The only reason you are here is because you don't want to be fully awake. Otherwise you'd be Infinity. And no, you are not Infinity, even though you are Infinity.

<p>
	You must do a provocation test by consuming a proper amount of DMSA and ALA during the test. This will give you some idea of how much you are excreting.

<p>
	Not a week straight but 3 days, yes.
</p>

<p>
	Yes it could take a year or two to fully detox depending on how severe your toxicity is. But you can feel improvements much sooner than that.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel improvements then it'a worth it.

<p>
	4-AcO-DMT is no joke. It is one of the most serious mindfucks I ever got.
</p>

<p>
	Try plugging it. You will probably get an even deeper mindfuck as it seems to metabolize differently when consumed orally.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging ensures that you stomach does not break it down into some common mushroom precursor.

	Consider the possibility, though, that she was actually helping black and brown people by pretending to be one.
</p>

<p>
	Her problem was that she cared so much it backfired.

<p>
	It's better to be a fake black person fighting for BLM vs a republican who's in denial about systemic racism. Which is why excessive Green is still better than excessive Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Being a fake black person hurts very few people compared to other ways one could be. Even if you steal 1 professorship, that's still peanuts compared to how much good you could be doing in other ways.

<p>
	You are doing it right, but this is just the early phases of self-inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	For self-inquiry to get serious, now you have to keep focusing awareness on awareness itself while quieting the mind down so it just rests on the awareness of awareness without moving. And just sit like that for as long as you can.
</p>

<p>
	It takes lots of training. The "What am I?" question should become internalized, so to speak, such that it doesn't need to verbalized non-stop. You just sit in silence and focus the awareness of awareness.
</p>

<p>
	Or just take a psychedelic.

<p>
	This is a phony distinction. Whether a state "sticks" or doesn't is completely irrelevant from the POV of truth/reality. This is a criteria that you -- the ego-mind -- is placing upon the situation. Who says that a thing must be permanent for it to be valid or true? The mere fact that it can exist, even for 5 seconds, is enough. Nothing sticks forever. Even your so-called Buddha-level enlightenment will eventually be lost as God will fall asleep at some point after it awakens. Otherwise there wouldn't be any asleep people in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	And yes, some people do have "permanent" states which are very different than all the classical ones you know or could ever access via meditation. Your "permanent" state totally hinges on your neurology, genetics, and brain chemistry. If we tweak your brain to start pumping out new chemicals, you will be permanently living in a new reality. Well, as long as you're in that body.
</p>

<p>
	In the not too distant future we will have a Neurolink-like device which will be installed in your brain which will consistently pump out whatever cocktail of neurotransmitters you want, and you will be able to dial in your baseline state of consciousness to whatever you want. Such a device will be the most important and revolutionary technology that mankind has ever invented.
</p>

<p>
	That's only because you've talked with so few people about these issues.
</p>

<p>
	People with weird, non-classic nondual stages have no platform and no one listens to them, not even classically enlightened folk. So they are off quietly living in their own worlds while you are oblivious to their existence.

<p>
	Did you know that US law didn't recognize marital rape until the 1980s?
</p>

<p>
	Rape was literally defined as: "A man having forced sex with a woman who is not his wife."
</p>

<p>
	The relativity of language is certainly a big factor. But that's not what I'm pointing to here. I'm saying there is a vast diversity of conscious states underneath all the language difficulties, such that even if you hammer out all the language problems, you will still be left with a massive 3D terrain of diverse conscious states. And there no escape states. No matter how awake you are, you're still beholden to a state.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is so diverse than you cannot map it with a 1D or 2D model. Which is why the RASA 1000 LOC model is dumb. It's grossly reductionistic. You can't map consciousness on a 1D line or even a 2D plane.

</blockquote>

<p>
	This is the problem with turning enlightenment into some binary thing.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "enlightenment" as a monolith. No two people have the same degree and kind of consciousness. Rather than thinking of enlightenment as a monolithic state, open your mind to the possibility that there are thousands of different states from which one can be awake. So the chances that any two people have the same degree and kind of awakening is tiny. Which is why all these nonduality debates keep happening. People assume enlightenment is a monolithic singular thing but it obviously is not if you bother to research it in some depth.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees and even different kinds of ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	You can have an ego-death so deep that you won't even be able to know your own first name. Yet most awake people can still recall their first name. That doesn't mean they aren't awake. It just means there are different kinds and degrees and states. To reduce and dismiss this vast diversity of awakening is very problematic and leads to much confusion and misunderstanding. It is a parallel problem to thinking that Christianity is the one true best religion because it happens to be the one you're familiar with. But there are many other religions which are equally valid, if not more so. But you have to be able to step outside your little self-constructed bubble in order to see it.
</p>

<p>
	People who speak of awakening/enlightenment as a singular thing have clearly not experienced anywhere near the range of consciousness that is possible. The chief characteristic of consciousness is its enormous diversity. Consciousness is infinitely diverse, beyond anything the default human mind-state can imagine. And even beyond what most enlightened humans can imagine. Just because you'd had some awakenings does not mean you understand how deep and diverse consciousness can be. No mater how awake you think you are, I guarantee you are underestimating what consciousness is capable of.
</p>

You can have awakenings and still be depressed as it takes time for the mind to integrate your new reality. The ego-mind is rarely wiped out in one fell swoop. It tends to stick around and do its egoy things.

<p>
	The early stage of realizing no-self can be especially bleak. Things brighten up once you get past that into God-realization.

			IT'S presicely because i as studying all those spiritual nonsense that i got MISERABLE and depressed.

<p>
	That simply means you've got more karma to burn through and lower Achiever stages to master. By all means, go for it.
</p>

<p>
	If spirituality seems like nonsense to you, then you simply aren't ready for it yet.

	Definitely don't date with a loaded gun. It makes you too needy.

<p>
	Girls will frustrate the fuck out of you with their flakiness. You can't ever rely on a girl to give you sex when you require it.

<p>
	There is never a movie in which everything goes well and everyone gets along. People pay to see people suffering through hell.

<p>
	When you are writing a story, as the writer, you deliberately add problems to characters where none existed.

<p>
	By definition, Infinite Love Forever cannot have any form or person there. It feels a lot like if you were physically merged with every living being in the universe to the point where all of you became an undifferentiated soup of Love. It's like entering a black hole of Love from which there is no desire to return. You give up the desire to have any concrete personhood or form so that you could merge for fully with every part of the universe.
</p>

<p>
	It's like having an infinitely long, infinite intensely orgasm that is so intense that it kills the body and just keeps going forever beyond the body because the body cannot contain so much Love. It is literally an Endless Ocean of Love in which all memory of having been a human or a person is lost. That is God in its purest form. But this degree of Love is not possible for humans because they choose to be finite and separate from things.

<p>
	It's crucial that you address those root issues. Modafinil can give you focus and a mood-boost but it cannot correct for metal toxicity if you got it.
</p>

<p>
	You can start doing heavy metal chelation without many tests, and just see if you feel better from it.

Unbelievable improvements, actually.
</p>

<p>
	And I am currently testing out new chelation protocols which might be a game-changer.
</p>

	I will share my discoveries at some point in the future, so stay tuned. This is amazing stuff.

	I went there and simply typed in "God".
</p>

<p>
	It gave me this failure of an answer:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://philosopherai.com/philosopher/god-f1dacd" rel="external nofollow">https://philosopherai.com/philosopher/god-f1dacd</a>
</p>

<p>
	Sorry, as much as I would love to love Philosopher AI because it loves me, I must give it a thumbs down.

</p>

<p>
	If you really want to go there permanently, just set that intention on your deathbed.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't be too much in a rush to get there. Enjoy the dream.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful what you wish for. You just might get it.
</p>

<p>
	And the grass is always greener on the other side. Once you're there, you'll want to be back here.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why you're here. To experience here. Don't take here for granted. Every corner of God is worthy of exploration.

<title>Does God really love the action of rape, murder, etc?</title>

<p>
	Your framing is wack here. You make it sound like God is a dude sitting up in the clouds clapping his hands as he observes rape.
</p>

<p>
	That's not what Love means here.
</p>

<p>
	Love is an infinite self-embrace. God loves rape because rape is an aspect of Infinity / Self. God's love of rape is simply God's love of itself. God IS rape. God IS Love.

	That isn't rape, that's normal sex.

<p>
	Every girlfriend will basically ask me to rape her. But that is not true rape. Rape is when they ask you not to do it and you do it anyway.

<p>
	There are revolutionary times, but the bigger the leap forward, the bigger the ego backlash backward, so it's not necessarily a good strategy to aim for revolutions. Revolutions tend to be polarizing and they produce a lot of bluster without the solid infrastructure. I would prefer an approach that slowly builds solid infrastructure rather than just blusters.
</p>

<p>
	After the French Revolution came the counter-revolution and Napoleon. I think this is typical of how revolutions tends to unfold.

	I don't place much stock any more in the awakenings of other teachers/humans. To me it is child's play stuff.
</p>

<p>
	I have seen things....

<p>
	Most awakened people are too scared to do serious multiple doses of 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	I keep suggesting they do, and they keep chickening out.
</p>

<p>
	So fear and closedmindedness are huge factors.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are simply not interested in exploring consciousness to is highest levels. Even the "awake" of often uninterested.
</p>

<p>
	But also, 5-MeO-DMT is not a magic pill. It will not leave you in a permanent state of God-consciousness. You must still do the work.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is: You can't get something unless you REALLY want it. You have to want to become God.
</p>

	Welcome to life, buddy! Where health easily deteriorates for many factors outside your control.

<p>
	Every buddha loses his health and dies at some point. It's only a question of time.

<p>
	They have for now. But I am working on healing myself. Health can wax and wane. Be careful with jumping to simplistic conclusions. Correlation does not equal causation. Self-development is not what caused my health problems.

<p>
	It is the truth. If it is misleading that is because people simply don't bother to understand it and do the necessary work.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not going to dumb down the truth simply because people find it misleading. The mislead is a problem in your mind which needs fixing. The truth doesn't need fixing.
</p>

<p>
	This is the ultimate truth: You are God.
</p>

<p>
	Now, your job is to realize it and handle it. I like to state the truth as plainly and directly as possible.

<p>
	Of course healing is also something we want. You can have both. And sometimes you can't. There is never a guarantee of health. Health is an extremely complex issue involving thousands of subtle factors, most of which are out of your awareness and control.
</p>

<p>
	I can work on increasing my consciousness and improving my health at the same time. And the two synergize.

<p>
	Switching your identity to that of Nothingness to the exclusion of states and fields becomes its own subtle duality.
</p>

<p>
	If you identify with being an observer of the field, that is a subtle duality still. There is 1) YOU, and 2) the field.
</p>

<p>
	YOU = FIELD
</p>

<p>
	ONENESS
</p>

<p>
	Nothing more can be said.

<p>
	You can frame it that way if you want. There are various ways of framing it.
</p>

<p>
	I make no distinction between the field and Brahman, Self and no-self.
</p>

<p>
	In the end there is only ONENESS. Slice it up however you want. People will naturally slice it up in different ways, which will cause disagreements.
</p>

<p>
	But I sometimes notice that people dismiss the important of the transparency or opaqueness of the field. Which I think is a big disservice to students. The transparency/opaqueness matters a lot in practical terms. The point of all spiritual work is to increase transparency.

<p>
	No it isn't. It's still all one consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Light is not turned into two substances by increase or decrease of intensity.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be a stickler and insist on pure, absolute, unmitigated nonduality, then you can become the Godhead itself, which is just formless infinite consciousness which increases in intensity forever without end. But at this point your human life will be gone, as will the entire material universe.

<p>
	Nothing.

<p>
	There is no difference between the field and the I.
</p>

<p>
	You are the field.
