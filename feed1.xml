<p>
	There are many business courses and seminars which teach you the how-to.
</p>

<p>
	But mostly the how-to of business is learned by simply doing it. You make it up as you go along and follow your vision. Business requires strong vision & lots of studying your target market. You need to develop deep expertise in whatever market you're trying to enter.

	Those are your own expectations. No guru is obligated to meet your scientific standards in a lab like a rat in a maze.
</p>

<p>
	And you have no idea how many materialization have been demonstrated or repeated, because most of them would never get documented due to the very cynicism you're displaying. If you expect not to see something, you won't see it.

</p>

<p>
	Don't be so cynical. Extraordinary healing is certainly possible and materialization is within the realm of possibility. It's not so farfetched.
</p>

<p>
	And just because some people in the past have been fakes does not mean the fundamental phenomenon is bogus. Just like with enlightenment, there have been many fake people claiming the existence of God, yet God is still real. Once you realize that God is real, almost anything becomes possible.
</p>

<p>
	Be open but also grounded. It's a delicate balancing act. Notice, I did not just accept the video at face-value. To me that video is ambiguous and not definitive proof. But it is interesting.

It overcomes this problem by smoothening the trip so you can really understand what is going on, not just be blindsided and take away nothing.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to understand what the trip is doing, how consciousness functions. Otherwise it just becomes a wacky dream-like experience.

I meant, for example, someone was trying to hide his/her "deepest, darkest secret," and this person isn't telling you what it is because this person feels uncomfortable. But, you cannot help this person if you don't know. Then, all of a sudden, you got the insight in full details without this person telling you, and you're able to help this person. (Long story short.)

<p>
	You are talking about reading people's minds.

<p>
	That may be possible but that's not important. Omniscience is a much more radical thing. You can become so conscious you will understand how you invented Albert Einstein, for example. Lol. It's very radical and non-linear.

			Leo has made a few different awakening videos, saying he goes deeper and deeper. Perhaps he ends up going deeper and deeper. I will say that on the whole the concepts in all the videos feel identical. I'm just a bit confused when Leo thinks he's experienced states of consciousness beyond what is taught in conventional non-dual wisdom, I mean to me it sounds like Leo and Hinduism for example are saying the same thing. For example Alan Watts gives the analogy of the fact that everyone is a different expression of God, and that you're playing hide and seek with yourself. And the ideas of formlessness, the void being beyond all language.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The basics of what I'm saying doesn't contradict classic nondual teachings of course. It's just a question of how deeply you realize what God is. God can understand itself at deeper and deeper levels.
</p>

<p>
	The highest truth is that you are God. But how deeply do you understand what that really entails?
</p>

<p>
	My point about the 2008 recession was that the banking industry and Wall Street were not properly regulated due to anti-regulation stance of the conservative/libertarian administration.
</p>

<p>
	Those industries are still not properly regulated and exploit and steal from many Americans. Wall Street is very corrupt and also corrupts all our elected leaders with their stolen and exploited money. This is not good for raising the consciousness of Americans.
</p>

<p>
	Wall Street and giant banks are allowed to be breeding grounds for devils. It's utterly corrupt and exploitative. No conscious society would allow such a thing. Most people do not fully understand how corrupt these systems are. And Trump only adds fuel to the fire by appointing these devils to his administration.

			I did. Hitting a breakthrough with N,N-DMT is significantly harder, which is why majority of people are unable to. It requires to have a good theoretical foundation and understanding of non-duality. Why? Because it is not strong enough to simply overpower the EGO, like 5-MEO can.
		</p>

		<p>
			When you vape 5-MEO, you can either surrender or resist it. If you surrender into experience(considering you have the right dosage), you will have a breakthrough, even if you lack that solid theoretical foundation of non-duality.
		</p>

		<p>
			I can confirm this not only from my own experience, but other people who I know - who couldn't get a breakthrough with N-DMT, but got it through vaping 5-MEO. The difference is day and night.

		<p>
			If you have the option to do 5-MEO, I would advice people to just go straight to 5-MEO.

			Also, what do you think about the quote "Unearned consciousness is valueless" in connection to psychedelics, I heard David Deida and Ken Wilber say that, so I was questioning, also how much formal practice is necessary to make a psychedelic experience valuable or does it depend more upon theory or more ambiguous factors such as predispositions, environment, brain chemistry even, or past life experiences, karma, etc ?

<p>
	I reject the notion that consciousness has to be "earned". You are God! You don't have to "earn" anything to know yourself as God.

<title>Leo, What Teachers Have Had The Same Realizations As You?</title>

<p>
	What I have personally experienced has taken me beyond all teachers that I have studied. This is not to denigrate other teachers. There just comes a time where you go beyond what can be taught.
</p>

<p>
	At peak omniscience I become aware of limitations in the teachings of even the greatest masters.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Ralston does not teach about Absolute Love, and this is a big oversight from my experience. To not teach Love is nuts! It's totally fundamental. I cannot hold someone who denies Love as having reached the highest level of consciousness. And I like Ralston very much. But I like Love more.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear, I can still learn from teachers. There are always many minor things to learn.
</p>

<p>
	But the deepest truth must be gotten direct from the source: yourself.
</p>

<p>
	That's exactly what happens with lots of psychedelic use. Each trip produces a big breakthrough. Then you drop back to baseline, but not entirely. And with each such trip your awareness expands, expands, expands, gradually, until one day you find yourself very wake effortlessly. It's a process of both sudden and gradual awakening.

<p>
	No, I expect it to be about 1 hour long and similar to vaping but smoother and a bit milder.
</p>

<p>
	It will be closer to vaping than aya I would imagine. Similar to how 5-MeO works.
</p>

<p>
	I think plugging it will be really really good. But don't know for sure yet.

<p>
	I think they can both be equally powerful but in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is not visually powerful.

<p>

	That's exactly why N,N-DMT should be plugged. It will be much smoother and gentler.

<title>Who's Interested In Conscious Politics?</title>

They tried to blame him for inciting people against Rome, because they had a hard time coming up with a good reason to crucify him but he never did that. He told people to pay their taxes and he resisted when they tried to force him into becoming a king. Jesus was a healer and a spiritual teacher. He knew his life purpose and stuck to it. He didn't try to be a radical, it just happened to be the case.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	My point about Jesus was not his politics but the fact that he was a radical in his time. You think the rabbis of his time weren't upset with him? A guy who came along and starts a whole new version of Judaism? Proclaiming to be the son of God? Ordinary folks in that era would have perceived this as outrageous radicalism of the highest order. Utter blasphemy and disrespect of tradition. If the Romans hadn't killed him the Jews might have.

			I do see your point but is there no room for mediators and compromises? Isn't that the purpose of understanding other people and using the model of spiral dynamics? Too much change too soon causes collective ego backlash, and that's what Trump embodies. We have a two party system, and an electoral college that decides for us. If the popular vote decided the election Hillary Clinton would have won. Rural American gets more weight in elections and you have to apply your understanding of spiral dynamics. Bernie might work out. He had a great shot in the last election but we can sit here and blame the DNC and corruption there for that. Bernie better understands rural America and how to speak to people. I think he is seen as too polarizing now. 
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Our problem is not too much change too soon. The planet is dying. We need radical change 30 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	Just because there is an ego backlash does not mean we stop pushing for much-needed reform. There is always ego backlash. This is nothing new. Don't let fear of ego backlash prevent you from making the right moves which you know will help people.
</p>

<p>
	You think the abolition of slavery didn't come with a backlash? What were folks supposed to do? Maintain slavery simply because the slave owners would bitch about losing their slaves? Those in power always bitch about how unfair it is that their power is being taken away.

			You're very well educated, and you've spent your life around people who are also well educated. Spend some time living in rural America and you'll have a different world view.  I'm not sure that you realize how intimidating a politician who doesn't hide their intelligence is to people who don't have a good education. You have to know how to talk to people on their level. Bernie knows this. Hillary Clinton had little understanding of it and neither does Elizabeth Warren. Warren would be my top pick if it was up to me, but it's incredibly difficult for anyone to come off as both highly intelligent, capable AND down to earth.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I agree that uneducated people tend to dislike highly educated wonks. I think Bernie doesn't have this problem. Bernie comes across as an ordinary guy, not an elite university professor. This is a potential problem for Warren. But again, this is an image problem, not a substantive one.

		</p>

<p>
	Conscious politics requires that you stop thinking about your personal agenda so much. There are larger issues here beyond whether you will personally benefit from a policy. Besides, your children might benefit. And you will benefit if we live in a society where most people are well-educated rather than bigots who believe every piece of right-wing propaganda.
</p>

<p>
	This year I personally gained $40,000 in tax refund thanks to Trump. The government literally mailed me a check for $40,000. Next year I will probably get another $40,000. So for me, Bernie is terrible. I will lose so much money with him in office. But I don't let my personal finances get in the way of what is right for the country at large. That is conscious politics. It's not about what's best for me. It's about what's best for the majority of people and what equalizes consciousness. Giving rich people like me $40,000 does not help to equalize consciousness, it does the opposite. Nor did I vote to get a tax cut.

<p>
	It's quite the paradox.
</p>

<p>
	When I am fully conscious, there is no one left to awaken. All my work is self-entertainment.
</p>

<p>
	When you fully awake you will realize there isn't anyone here but you. But you will also quickly drop back down into conventional reality and treat other people as if they are real and objective. You can't really help it. It's just practical and works for purposes of survival.

<p>
	This one's a bit tricky and I'm still a bit unsure about it. I will clarify it soon.
</p>

<p>
	Basically it boils down to one of these options:
</p>

<p>
	1) You don't really exist. You are just a figment of my imagination. The entire world is just for me. In other words, total solipsism.
</p>

<p>
	2) God subdivided itself into separate dimensions, one of which is mine and one of which is yours. Of course since both of us are God, both of us are being both dimensions at once. So I and you are literally one consciousness but experiencing different forms.
</p>

<p>
	What I know 100% is that the formlessness in you is the formlessness in me. The all-seeing-eye is one in every living being. But I'm not yet totally sure how other dimensions might be created. Remember, nothing is impossible to God. It can create dimensions out of thin air if it wants to.

			I watched half the video, haven’t had any spiritual awakenings myself, but I’m completely open-minded to what is being said here.
		</p>

		<p>
			But I’m asking anyway. If everything is just an imagination, then is the insight that everything is an imagination, also an imagination? If yes it is an imagination, then what makes it “truth”?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	All form is God's imagination. An insights is form, so yes it is imagined. But also insight can carry "truth". I don't know how to explain it. Insight is fundamental to consciousness. Consciousness is capable of insight. It can be self-knowing. Conscious can understand itself. That's what makes it mystical.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Oh ok you can be conscious of it and directly experience it, right? Ok but direct experience varifies it, why isn’t materialism truth? We’re here experiencing it right? What makes spirituality a direct way of accessing the truth? How does a tiny spec of dust on a tiny Earth access the truth? There’s infinite numbers of unknown galaxies and planets that we do not know of, and what if there were aliens who access the truth differently?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The answer is very radical: every object outside of your current experience right now which you think exists, is something you're imaging. If it's not directly present, it is directly present as an image. So a galaxy exists in your mind as an image. If you were to travel to space and look at a galaxy with your eyes, the galaxy would now be created for you by you.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bit like a video game rendering engine. It does not render the world other than what the player is able to see right now. There really isn't a "world", there is only what's rendered at any given moment.
</p>

<p>
	Your birth and death are something you're imagining, for example. When you realize that, you will become immortal in that instant. Until you start imagining your birth and death again. Then you will become mortal. The way you were born is that you imagined you were born. And so it was.

The static world you used to live in was miserable and full of fear. Now that you see it's all an illusion you can love it all to the hilt and be joyful because you have absolutely nothing to lose.
</p>

<p>
	You need to go deeper. Your ego is misconstruing things, projecting its own problems on it.
</p>

<p>
	1 trip is nothin', just peanuts.

	You expect all spiritual people to agree? Why do you think no two spiritual people agree 100%?

	I have no problem vaping 5-MeO and I will do it. I have no dogma against it. I simply have been busy with other things.

		</p>

		<p>
			He specifically stated that gathering understanding and insights is not needed when it comes to using 5-MEO - it's a desire of the ego. It's a HUGE contradiction. And this is also one of the reasons why you don't prefer to vaping it, because you would not be able to as many insights after the trip.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a non-issue.
</p>

<p>
	You are acting as though insight is something wrong or bad. This is absurd. The whole point of the spiritual path is to gain deeper insight into the nature of self, God, reality, and life. This is not "ego." This is self-recognition at a fine-grained level.
</p>

<p>
	As God I enjoy studying myself in many different ways. If you don't want that, then do whatever you want. I could spend 1 million years studying myself. And I will.
</p>

<p>
	My path is what's known as Jnana yoga. It's an intellect oriented path. Other people prefer a heart oriented path. I like to dissect stuff and make sense of it.
</p>

<p>
	Anti-intellectualism is not a requirement of awakening. You can do both. The Jnana yoga path is very documented in history.

	Not really. You suggest they use that word in a binary way whereas I use it more as matters of degree.
</p>

<p>
	You can map a binary model onto a non-binary model.

<p>

	I don't recall saying that either.

<p>
	Obviously the more conscious you are, the less you will tend to act like a devil. But if you slip up and act like a devil anyway (which does happen), that is okay too.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, it's not such a big contradiction as you think.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I emphasize understanding and insight more than Martin does. But this does not contradict anything. I am simply interested in insight and understanding. It is definitely possible to understand yourself as God and all of the facets which you are. Not in a rational linguistic manner.
</p>

<p>
	Understanding and Being are ultimately one. So there's no serious contradiction here, just a difference in emphasis.
</p>

<p>
	It's not merely the ego that wants to know. God is waking up to itself. God wants to know what it is. Don't dismiss this as mere ego.
</p>

<p>
	Martin has a certain style of working with 5-MeO and I have my own style. Different people have different styles of doing this work. And that's okay. Find your own fave style.
</p>

<p>
	I do "energetic experiencing and processing too" on my trips. It's not as though I sit there and conceptualize stuff on the trip, LOL. Having insights and understanding and doing energetic process work well together. Don't make it a false dichotomy. You can have it all!
</p>

			Do you understand that the people who you consider to be enlightened frame it this way? One of whom took 10x more 5-MEO than you have. Martin W Ball makes it very clear and that is how he described his own process. He had many "non-dual experiences" until he totally liberated himself.
		</p>

		<p>
			Eckhart Tolle who you also consider to be enlightened, defines enlightenment as the end of suffering (psychological), and full awakeness, always having non-dual awareness in the background, and in the present moment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There comes a point in your evolution where you must throw away all so called authority futures. You must kill the Buddha to become the Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	I cannot speak to anyone's experience but my own.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really contradict Ball or Tolle. We agree more than we disagree. We all fundamentally agree on nonduality being the Truth. The rest is minutia.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			This is again where other people who you consider to be "enlightened" would disagree. Guys like Eckhart Tolle, and Rupert Spira would tell you that morals are there to limit the EGO, and once the person becomes conscious, morals are no longer needed. They are saying that actions that you consider "immoral" are usually very egoic by nature, so it doesn't make any sense for an enlightened being to go around murdering people. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Also based from my own "awakenings", I noticed what they are saying is true - the desire to commit "immoral" actions reduces tenfold automatically.  Which makes me doubt some of the things that you are saying, it reminds me of "zen delivery" very much.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, I have never said that your desire to commit "immoral" actions will increase. I simply said that no matter what action you take, you will love yourself if you are fully conscious. This is total liberation: you are free to do whatever you want and still love yourself. This does not mean you will become a serial killer.
</p>

<p>
	This is so obvious I shouldn't even have to qualify it.
</p>

<p>
	1) Yes, such videos are no designed to be practical. They are just designed to share my journey.
</p>

<p>
	2) Which is why I post it on my blog, not the main channel.
</p>

<p>
	3) It really doesn't matter to me any more. My top priority is to become maximally conscious. These levels of consciousness are impossible to explain or teach to anyone. All I can do is tell you they are real and true and worthwhile to attain. And I can demonstrate them with the way I am. In the end I will just be a roving Jesus figure who radiates truth & love. And that will be my highest teaching.

			At this stage, how do you feel about spending time on practices like kriya or formal meditation? There is still value or would it feel like something pulling you to your previous stage? (More acceptance, less being disturbed from the natural arisings from the mind) Sounds like the next retreats might be easier haha
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's hard to say. I just don't think it's realistic to reach such high levels of consciousness through meditation or self-inquiry for most ordinary people. Yoga maybe, but even that I doubt.
</p>

<p>
	I still recommend these practices to most people because something is better than nothing at all. But if you really care to awaken like a motherfucker, 5-MeO-DMT is the answer.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get discouraged by this. See it as a bonus boost to the traditional path.
</p>

<p>
	My next retreats will be psychedelic retreats. But I still want to experiment some more with yoga and meditation just boils to sitting down and being still for me. So in effect I meditate every time I sit still, and even sometimes as I move about. It just becomes more and more natural to the point where it's not even right to call it meditation. It's just being aware of whatever is happening.

You can imagine whatever worlds you want. Mushrooms expand your possibility to imagine new worlds and become aware of yourself as God. You are barely starting to learn how powerful your God mind is. Everything is your mind. You are all alone dreaming all this stuff up. You cannot die. You have been sitting here imagining shit for all of eternity.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course, but taking 5-MeO-DMT as your first psychedelic will be way too much for you to handle. You are likely to scare yourself so hard that you'll never try another psychedelic again. I would suggest the lesser psychedelics first to get your feet wet. Then transition to 5-MeO and don't look back.
</p>

<p>
	Getting into psychedelics is a long-term affair. It is not something you do a few times and stop. This will produce no meaningful result. You must gradually but methodically explore the field. It takes a few years of practice just to get your bearings straight and really get to work. Then it becomes the most powerful growth tool imaginable.

	Oh yes. 5-MeO-DMT is just superior if you can get it. But other psychedelics are still great.

<p>
	No, not at all.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to become totally omniscient, at least for a while. It is not verbal or rational knowledge. It is hyper-dimensional understanding which just cannot be put into words. It's what you might imagine to be God's knowledge of itself. You literally know how you created the whole universe. But you could never explain it to anyone in words, not even to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Being, understanding, and knowledge all merge into one.

<p>
	By exploring various states you learn what consciousness is capable of, which helps you understand what it is.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately what you're searching for is a state of total omniscience, where everything is 100% understood. This would be the God state.

		</p>

		<p>
			But this is something that i didn't get, like i said to my auntie, we went to the zoo and she basically said this lion is alone and is feeling sad and the zoo should have captured another lion as it must be feeling lonely. But i said to her the lion doesn't think, it has no sentence for I am hungry, i am feeling lonely. But she couldn't understand it what i was trying to get at... basically it doesn't have a sense of I. SO it doesn't think about being lonely, thats simply a projection you've added (but i never told her this) 
		</p>

		<p>
			This being so, what didn't make sense to me was how they're communication features and survival insticts differ to ours, when they don't have a sense of "i", it means that if they're scared, they're scared for the time period they're feeling safe, as soon as they feel they're out of danger, it goes away instantly! and leaves no mark in the past or present, as these are human ideology again added. 
		</p>

		<p>
			still i couldn't understand what made them want to survive as the distinct consciousness they are... but your telling me its because they live in a different consciousness state.. thats different to our human consciousness, so our human consciousness is perfect to allow us to be human, their particular consciousness state allows them to be their consciousness that gives them to be exactly perfect as their "BEING" SELF without a sense of self ,
		</p>

		<p>
			But this is only an analogy your using, so your saying you accessed a totally different consciousness state, so this means you accessed a totally different state that was "non-human" in its make up, which i don't see as impossible because human itself is only a concept, when you enter the realms of absolute infinity, this is what i would of expected, you should be able to alter your consciousness at will, to the power of infinity, but you know that its not different as there is only one, still you play in infinity.

<p>
	Imagine that there is a state of consciousness in which you exist as a brick for 1 billion years.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that there is a state of consciousness in which you are alien existing in 11 dimensions.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that there is a state of consciousness in which you exist as all the books ever written by humans.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that there is a state of consciousness in which you exist as the color yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Totally wacky stuff like that which is totally impossible from your current state of consciousness.

<p>
	No
</p>

<p>
	First and foremost the state of consciousness is determined by what we call physiology, DNA, and brain chemistry. All of these are relative things, but obviously a lobster has a totally different state of consciousness than a human. It's not just a matter of higher or lower. It's a totally different state. That state actually determines what a lobster is and what it can do.
</p>

<p>
	You can think of it like different video game worlds. Each video game has its own unique world which is like one state. You can't map all video games on a single axis.

There is only 1 consciousness. But it can take an infinite number of states. The state it takes determines how deeply it knows itself. In some states it knows itself totally, in other states its as dumb as doorknob. And everything in between.

<p>
	Consciousness is technically infinite. It has no limits whatsoever and it can do just about anything. So be careful underestimating it or modeling it.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't even have a beginning or an end. There really isn't an "awakening path", rather there are an infinite number of different ways that consciousness can be and know itself. How deeply can it know itself? I have not hit any upper limit yet. My guess is it can know itself completely, but probably not while also maintaining the human form.

<p>
	You actually have no idea what the Buddha realized.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that consciousness does not only come in degrees, but is also multi-dimensional.
</p>

<p>
	From what I currently understand, you cannot map consciousness on a single axis. There are multiple axes.

That's something I hope to verify at some point.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with plugging it is that you need a much larger dose than 5-Meo. You're looking at 50-200mg. Probably closer to 100mg+ for a breakthrough dose. That will sting the ass more.
</p>

<p>
	But on the plus side, the trip should be a lot smoother and longer. Not those lame 5 minute trips.
</p>

<p>
	I would like to hear from anyone who's tried plugging it. What were your results? What was your dose?
</p>

<p>
	Elitist? Lol
</p>

<p>
	Integration is always ongoing. Far more time is spent on integration than on tripping. For every one hour of tripping there's maybe 5 to 20 hours of integration. Some trips take months of integration. It's not a walk in the park. Deep stuff gets surfaced, like psychotherapy at times.

<p>
	There's also a possibility that many of you aren't considering: What if the highest levels of awakening can ONLY be reached through 5-MeO-DMT? What if there are levels so high that they cannot be accessed by an unaltered human brain? Don't overlook such a possibility. The Buddha may not be the most enlightened person ever. The fact is you just don't know until you try. There is no reason to expect that the normal human brain can access all dimensions of consciousness possible. It very likely cannot.

<p>
	Well, I feel it's finally time for us to start exploring N,N-DMT and sharing our findings. I don't have anything to report just yet but time will change that.
</p>

<p>
	This thread is for sharing reports of experiences, videos, techniques, dosages, theories, etc.
</p>

<p>
	No sourcing questions.
</p>

<p>
	Also don't confuse this with 5-MeO-DMT. They are very different substances and we have a separate 5-MeO-DMT Mega-Thread on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	It's beyond good. It's the only way to seriously do this work. You want as much time as possible to bask and contemplate in that glorious nonduality. And it's important to keep your eyes open.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	It would be awesome if we were able to find a way of extending the trip duration even more. Perhaps some supplement combo could do it. But you have to be extremely careful testing out combos. The wrong combo could be lethal. For example taking 5-MeO-DMT with MAOI is extremely dangerous and should never be done.

<p>
	The following video is about N,N-DMT, but this guy invented a technique for doing an IV drip of DMT which allows for maintaining a breakthrough plateau for 1-24 hrs!
</p>

<p>
	The IV drip method is mentioned at that last 15 minutes of the video.
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">

	</div>
</div>

<p>
	I don't recommend you try this at home. But it should be possible to create an IV drip of 5-MeO-DMT which will keep you in a totally nondual state for many hours while contemplating reality. Again, do not try this at home by yourself. This should only be done in a laboratory.
</p>

<p>
	But imagine a future in which you could go down to your local clinic and get a 24 hour infusion of 5-MeO-DMT. That will be the most powerful tool for enlightenment ever.

But also each trips lasts much longer, so I feel that's a worthwhile trade-off.

<p>
	I don't mind spending 25-50% more substance for a smooth 1 hour trip vs a jerky 10 min trip.

		<p>
			I am interested in your views on this one.
		</p>

		<p>
			Do you think it's possible to permanently awaken by taking 5 meo constantly for a particular time? (Like 1 week-several months as long as it is needed)
		</p>

		<p>
			Its like one takes 5 meo and stays in nondual cognition for 3 hours, then the moment he feels the slightest tinge of duality arising, he takes another dose...so and so forth. Basically lets say a month of nondual cognition every waking moment. Could this facilitate a permanent sinking of ego?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is what I'm attempting to demonstrate. Let's see if it works.
</p>

<p>
	So far my ego has definitely been significantly reshaped after 35 trips.
</p>

<p>
	But also I don't feel a need to take 5-MeO as often as you describe. That would be overkill.
</p>

<p>
	My hypothesis is YES. But I'm willing to be proven wrong. That is the nature of scientific investigation.
</p>

<p>
	Martin Ball claims to have done it. So if you believe him, that would be 1 point of corroboration.
</p>

<p>
	The real problem is this: even if I succeed in doing it, who will believe me? Virtually no one. I will be called a deluded charlatan.
</p>

<p>
	You see, science is not as easy as people think. It's a marketing problem and a culture war problem more so than a problem of digging up raw data. Digging up the raw data is the easy part. Convincing the mainstream to accept it as truth is the hard part. How many Buddhists will denounce me for using 5-MeO-DMT? Many. A Buddhists are usually the most tolerant ones.
</p>

	What I said is simply the case.
</p>

<p>
	At the highest level, no wrong can be done.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I don't recommend you go around murdering people. But if you do, that will be okay too.

	That is literally the highest form of love. In the end all evil is you own creation. So you might as well love it.
</p>

<p>
	I am not a Buddhist and I do not recognize moral norms because they are ultimately delusions.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, what I am speaking of here is the Absolute "perspective" so to speak. Relatively we obey laws to produce a livable society.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Absolute Love is black & white by its very nature. There is zero room for not-love.
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps you have not become conscious of Absolute Love? It's a radical thing. It does not hold back for Buddhist moral norms.

			"Republican" is just a word and a concept that human beings are more or less resonant with.  That's all it is.  It's a linear label.  Every person is a mix between Conserativism (Yang) and Progressivism (Yin).  Apply the <u>Paradox of Conservativism and Progressivism</u>.  In that case, you'll see that the word/concept "Republican" has pros and cons, and you can integrate the pros and leave behind the cons of the word/concept "Republican".  Don't judge it, use it, see.

<p>
	No. This is terrible and sloppy analysis. With this kind of analysis the devils will exploit you since you're simplistically splitting everything down the middle and assuming symmetries which are actually asymmetrical.
</p>

<p>
	Republicans and Democrats are not just two sides of the same coin. Democrats are more conscious, more openminded, more Spirally developed, and less corrupt. This is very important to understand. This doesn't mean Democrats don't have flaws. They do. But Republicans have way bigger flaws. This needs to be acknowledged, otherwise you end up with a false equivalency which maintains an evil status quo.
</p>

<p>
	The midpoint between pro-slavery and anti-slavery positions is still slavery. A proper analysis of slavery must conclude that all slavery be abolished. Which can seem like a radical position. But of course "radical" is totally relative.

			Well I certainly agree on Biden being terrible. I think the reason I like Warren more than Bernie is that Bernie is very polarizing. A lot of Democrats just hate him. I'm not sure that bodes well for him being able to accomplish things. Warren is principled but is capable of being highly diplomatic.
		</p>

		<p>
			On Medicare for All, I haven't studied it carefully, but I've heard some arguments that, taken very literally, it may not necessarily the best way of getting to universal healthcare. I see Warren as someone who is absolutely in favor of universal health care, but perhaps doesn't want to be boxed into a specific plan that sounds good but that she's not sure will work well in practice.
		</p>

		<p>
			Foreign policy is an interesting point. Will have to look into that more...
		</p>

		<p>
			And Warren's Republicanism I actually view as a very healthy sign of an open mind. She figured out she was wrong and changed her ways. Not an easy thing to do as an adult.

<p>
	You make some good points.

<p>
	I worry that Warren may cave to more centrist, status quo forces. The system will try to co-opt her. I don't worry so much about that happening with Bernie.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, it sure can seem that way from your POV.
</p>

<p>
	Again, don't confuse consciousness and Truth for neutrality or weakness. Conscious people are capable of taking bold and decisive action which may seem crazy to those who are unconscious or part of the status quo.
</p>

<p>
	Conscious leaders can be radicals. Which does not make them fundamentalists. They just have a higher vision than the rest of society can see. First they mock you, then they slander you, then they try to kill you, and finally, 200 years later, they accept everything you said as obvious and moral, worshiping you as a prophet and saint.
</p>

<p>
	I am not moralistic at all. You are feel to kill whoever you want. You will still be loved by God. Nothing you do is wrong in any way. The moralistic one is you because you believe in good and bad, right and wrong, and you judge your own wickedness.
</p>

<p>
	My political discussions are purely pragmatic. In the absolute sense politics doesn't matter at all. The whole planet can die and it will be just fine. But not from the ego's POV. So we are really talking about how to create a better world for egos.
</p>

			Now it looks like you've scaled back your doses.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The way it worked is like this:
</p>

<p>
	I started testing oxalate and freebase. When testing new substances I always start very conservative and low. So I told myself, "Okay, 1 scoop should be half the usual dose and will probably be disappointing and weak, but I should err on the side of caution." So that's what I did, but I had two of the most powerful trips of my life. So I'm very glad I started out conservative because otherwise it would have been way too much.
</p>

<p>
	The lesson is this: When doing psychedelics always err on the conservative side. If you dose is too low, nothing bad will happen. At worst you'll just lose some time. But if you overshoot, the risks are very high. So it's worth being very, very careful and conservative. Which is exactly the opposite of what most psychonauts do. They often sloppily eyeball a 50mg dose without even bothering to buy a scale and shoot it with 2 beers, nachos, and a joint at a crowded movie theater.
</p>

<p>
	And that's when shit hits the fan. Don't be that guy! Be clinical with your dosing.
</p>

<p>
	This is a true of the entire spiritual path.

<p>
	The trips are just part of that path and the more one does the more one develops nuance and stability. Just like with any spiritual practice.

<p>
	Of course it does. Because it threatens your survival. Anything that threatens your survival you will label as evil. You cannot help it.

<p>
	That is exactly the kind of logic which gets Trump elected.
</p>

<p>
	Many people in this country have real problems. People are dying every day from lack of medical care, etc. They cannot wait around for 4 more years with no action simply because you want peace. If you do not address their problems they will vote in a fascist dictator worse than Trump next time because they are desperate. Desperate people do desperate things and you will end up paying the price for it.

			The problem I see is that both Warren and Sanders have been branded as extremists. Moderates and frustrated Republicans WILL come out to vote against Trump as long as the democratic candidate doesn't scare them away. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	We don't need Republicans to vote out Trump. Trump's support is no larger than 35%. He is deeply unpopular. The only reason he got elected in the first place is because people did not realize how bad he is. Now everyone reasonable understands. His base won't change their mind no matter what. But that doesn't matter. It's the swing voters who matter and they realize Trump is a con-artist.
</p>

<p>
	The Republicans will demonize any Democratic candidate. Even if it's Joe Biden. So this is a non-issue. That's how devilry works. It will not play fair or pull its punches. If you concede ground to a devil he will just keep taking more and more and more. He will never stop being a devil no matter how moderate and nice you are to him. In fact, he will label you an extremist for not giving him more.
</p>

<p>
	The demonization of Warren and Sanders is not an accident. It is how Maya works! People who stand up for truth and love are demonized and executed. This is not a valid reason to not support good leaders. All good leaders will be demonized by the status quo which is corrupted by ego.
</p>

<p>
	By your logic Jesus was too extremist to have been a religious leader. You should worship a Joe Biden instead. And indeed, if you were alive in the time of Jesus you would have cheered his execution and worshiped some orthodox Rabbi instead. Because Jesus was radical and rocked the boat. You want peace so you want the status quo, which is actually evil. But hey, it's what you're comfortable with, and from your POV that's what matters most: that you are comfortable. Nothing else much matters to you. That's ego. That's survival. That's evil.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Precisely because desire, sex, and gratification are identical to Nothingness. Why wouldn't you experience them? There is no why one way or the other. Making you totally free to do whatever.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	When you are fully awake (so to speak) there is no such thing as the ego. So actually no desire is egotistical. All desire is just a natural occurrance. There are not good or bad desires from the Absolute perspective. This is Total Love: to Love all the "bad" stuff so much that it is no longer bad at all.
</p>

<p>
	Such love is very radical and threatening to unawakened people because it interferes with survival.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	When you reach an even higher level of consciousness than you can presently imagine or have ever experienced, you will realize that EVERYTHING IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT. This is Paradise and Nirvana. And it is liberation. You are liberated precisely because you realize that no matter what happens it is Absolute Perfection. So there is nothing to resist or worry about.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is not simply Everything or neutrality. Reality is Absolutely Good. Period. It's not just good. It's THE BEST thing possible.
</p>

<p>
	You have not reached this level of consciousness yet. It's very radical. But I can tell you 110% that it's the Truth. I wish one day you discover it.

He will be business as usual, which is what lead to Trump's rise.
</p>

<p>
	To prevent the rise of awful people government needs to actually evolve and reform in meaningful ways which ordinary people feel. Otherwise dictators come to power with messages of fear-mongering and hate.

I like her too. But her track record is a bit worse than Bernie. She was a fucking Republican! I'm sure she's evolved a lot. But there are still a couple of issues where she's not as strong as Bernie. For example, she still waffles a bit on Medicare For All and her foreign policy is somewhat uncertain.
</p>

<p>
	She'd still be a great president of course compared to most other candidates.
</p>

<p>
	I hope she and Bernie beat out Joe Biden. She would also make a great VP, setting her up for the future.
</p>

<p>
	Joe Biden is terrible.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, you are trying to frame this in a binary way, which I reject.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of awakening. I have some degree of it, not the highest degree, and I am not immune to all pain/suffering. Although there have been times when I was so conscious that pain and suffering were realized to be no different than pleasure. But the body/mind is still not stupid. It still prefers to avoid physical pain, and it still has various desires. Pain, suffering, and desire are really not obstacles when you realize what they are. They are perfectly natural and even good. The desire to eliminate all desire is itself rather delusional. What I've realized is to embrace desire rather than to demonize it.
</p>

<p>
	It is perfectly okay if I desire sex, or even if I desire to murder someone. Who are you to say it's "wrong"? That would be ego judging.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, liberation just means that you realize that everything is perfect no matter how anything unfolds. So if you suffer, and you realize that's perfect, you are free of it even though pain is being felt.
</p>

<p>
	You are trying to categorize people as "fully awake" but in practice this is very problematic. I don't know if anyone ever is "fully awake" all the time. From what I understand this isn't really possible as you could hardly function as a human at that point. I much prefer to think of it as a spectrum with dozens of degrees of awakeness with perhaps no lower or upper bound.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://5-meo-dmt-malpractice.org/open-letter-concerning-abuses-by-octavio-rettig-and-gerry-sandoval/" rel="external nofollow">https://5-meo-dmt-malpractice.org/open-letter-concerning-abuses-by-octavio-rettig-and-gerry-sandoval/</a>
</p>

<p>
	Which documents some problems with how certain shaman's provide 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not sure if it's true, but it was concerning to me so I thought you guys should be aware of various dangers that might be involved when doing 5-MeO-DMT with a shaman. Be careful.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear: I am not taking any definitive stance on the allegations made. They could be phony for all I know. This is just something to keep in the back of your mind if you plan on working with a shaman.
</p>

<p>
	Show me one example of a person who left the body from doing 5-MeO-DMT. When you find such an example, then maybe I'll worry.
</p>

<p>
	Tens of thousands of people do 5-MeO-DMT. So if people were leaving their bodies, we'd be hearing about it. You can broaden this out to all psychedelics. Millions of people do psychedelics each year and I don't see them leaving their bodies.

But still scientific research and objective experiments can help us alot when it comes to how it should be used. For example you can learn what type of yoga or meditation is the most suitable for working with psychadelics through science. Or stuf like how often it should be used and the effect it has on your energies.

<p>
	Well of course I do such "science" myself by testing on myself.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot understand 5-MeO by doing it on guinea pigs. You must become your own guinea pig.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there is value to studying the chemistry of it.
</p>

<p>
	But science cannot be used to explain nonduality.

<p>
	I have explained this many times in the past.
</p>

<p>
	You can have truth without proof, but you cannot have proof without truth.
</p>

<p>
	The domain of truth is much larger than the domain of proof. There are many things which are true which cannot ever be proven with evidence. Because all evidence is indirect.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You are imagining lack of awareness. Right now you are aware, imagining that you will one day lose awareness. That is imagination. You are confusing your thoughts of the future for reality. You're not aware that all future is conceptual and happening right now (as an image).
</p>

<p>
	The future is an image in the present. That's what future IS!

</p>

<p>
	Sounds like your understanding is still intellectual to some degree.
</p>

<p>
	The Eternal can get very palpable. You can become so conscious of Eternality that it will feel like you can cut it with a knife. Like all the air was sucked out of the room.

It is not binary. I do not like it when people try to make it binary. To me it always comes in degrees and also with facets.
</p>

<p>
	What I have become conscious of goes beyond anything that I have ever heard any teacher teach. I don't care how masterful they claim to be. So I cannot listen to any teachers any more. Because there are levels of consciousness beyond all teachers and teachings. There are levels which cannot be spoken or taught in any way. And there is no method for reaching them.
</p>

<p>
	There is no higher authority than God. And you are it. So any authority figure you turn to is actually delusion. All gurus and masters are a thing you are hallucinating. You are truly the only guru in existence! So watch out who you give your power to.
</p>

<p>
	YOU ARE GOD! Whatever you imagine becomes true for you.
</p>

	About a 10mg scoop.

<p>
	You must keep in mind, I'm extremely sensitive to all psychedelics. So my doses are low, but they hit me hard. This will not be true for most people. Most of you will need double or triple the dose I take.
