</blockquote>

<p>
	Oneness is a very tricky thing. Let's say you are not compassionate, does that mean you are less one?
</p>

<p>
	There is a danger of taking on "compassion" and "goodness" as truer than "hate" and "badness". But that just perpetuates the duality. The deepest levels of consciousness are beyond compassion, beyond human concerns, beyond being good.
</p>

<p>
	The distinction between love and hate must collapse in the end.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate litmus test would be this: when you see great hate, are you still able to love? Does your compassion extend to the perpetrator as well as the victim? Or are you cherrypicking?

<p>
	"valid" and "invalid" are also inventions of the human mind.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is TOTAL. It includes Nazis, rape, murder, genocide, war, slavery, hate, racism, sexism, abuse, violence, theft, and a trillion other things. That's TRUTH.
</p>

<p>
	What I'm trying to do here is show you that you are cherrypicking the truth to suit your ego. Which is something you'll have to outgrow if you really want to reach liberation and peace.
</p>

<p>
	Truth and politics don't mix very well. Have you noticed? Have you wondered why that is?

<p>
	Of course!
</p>

<p>
	Not just freedom of speech, but even self defense and the right to life.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is, you have no rights. All "rights" are just inventions of the human ego to make life easier for the ego in an otherwise brutal reality.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you value freedom of speech is because your ego wants to mouth off its agenda without being limited. Egos hate having their agendas limited in any way. It hinders the ego's survival ability.
</p>

<p>
	If we passed a law which said that I could rape your child, but you are forbidden to ever speak of it, not even in court -- that would be a huge problem for your ego.

<p>
	"When it's not necessary" is a highly subjective call. The ego always finds it convenient to do unnecessary things.
</p>

<p>
	A person who does violence to another doesn't do it gratuitously. In his mind, he feels it is very necessary -- selfless even.

<p>
	You understand -- right? -- that most of the evil done in the world is done by people fighting for their rights?

<p>

			I don't see it as a survival issue, I don't NEED to be environmentally conscious and care for others to survive, in fact it would be easier not too, but then to me that WOULD be the ego? Putting ones own survival over the basic rights of other living beings? To me it seems more of an ego sacrifice to devote oneself to the liberation and protection of others
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I know you don't, which is why I went out of my way to underscore that it is a survival issue.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is very sneaky. It loves to don the veil of devoting oneself to the "protection of others" when in fact you are devoting yourself to advancing your own egoic agenda. Devotion creates a self-righteous ego which then goes on to commit great atrocities. All great atrocities are done in the name of good, freedom, liberation, truth, rights, fairness, etc.
</p>

<p>
	What do you think terrorists and Nazi's are doing? They are trying to make the world a better place.
</p>

<p>
	"Make the world a better place" is ALWAYS relative to your ego! There is no such thing as an objectively good world. A good world for one group is a bad world for another group. Which is why conflict happens.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you think you can get all of mankind to work peacefully together, that is still mankind's collective ego. Who's to say that mankind is a good thing, and not a cancer in this universe? You? Mankind? Ha! Do you see the conflict of interest problem?
</p>

<p>
	This is very important to understand. Otherwise you will still be under the ego's influence.
</p>

<p>
	Consider: the only reason you care about mankind is because you identify with being mankind. That's your ego. If you were an ant, you wouldn't care about mankind at all. Nor would you care about slavery, human rights, or anything else of that sort.
</p>

<p>
	Your self-identification extends far beyond your physical body. You identify with all sorts of abstract self-images, like the image of "being a decent human being who fights for the rights of the weak and the poor against the oppression of the strong and greedy". That's YOUR self-image! It turns you on. You get off on it. Playing this role is an addiction.

<p>
	Well... if you think about what a loop is very abstractly, it's a singular object which links back with itself via some backward, as yet unseen connection. So two ends which previously seemed separate are ultimately recognized to be one and the same.

<p>
	It will be much harder to find examples of Yellow than Blue, Orange, Green. Especially short stereotypical snippets. Yellow doesn't lend itself to easy ridicule and stereotyping. That's sorta the point.

</p>

<p>
	Your question is coming from a certain level of consciousness: duality.
</p>

<p>
	Your question is really about survival, not being or Truth. Survival demands constant manipulation. That is life. Improving society is a function of survival. Think of politics as nothing more than hunting squirrels in the forest to make sure you don't starve to death. That's what government is fundamentally about.
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing wrong with improving society, just like there's nothing wrong with hunting squirrels to survive, but there is a meta-issue: your preoccupation with survival is keeping you from realizing that the world is an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	What if one day you wake up and realize that all of this work you've been doing to improve society was happening inside a dream state? Such that slavery, racism, evil, nuclear weapons, science, and even your mother and father do not exist because they were just a dream? How silly would you feel then to have worried so much about all that stuff?

</blockquote>

<p>
	These are awakened people you are talking about it. To them, reality is just a dream. Nothing is serious. Whatever actions they take to "improve society" is just for shits and giggles. They are shooting at squirrels in the forest just for fun. It's a form of self-amusement. They are detached from it. They would not really care if the entire planet was nuked tomorrow. They would be just as happy. It would not be a problem for them in the same way that seeing the Earth get nuked on TV isn't a problem for you -- because you are conscious it isn't real to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	All human suffering is unreal.
</p>

<p>
	This kind of level of consciousness is difficult to fathom for someone who has not awoken from the dream. It is unimaginable that this could be possible.
</p>

<p>
	The reason an enlightened sage is good at helping people is because he is already dead inside. There is nothing for him to fear or lose. The world does not need improving, yet there is nothing else to really do here but help improve the world. That is the paradox. But you won't understand this at stage Green. You need some enlightenment experiences to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Morality is a function of survival. Not Truth. The ultimate truth is, there are no problems whatsoever and evil doesn't exist. Yes... detachment is a very radical and counter-intuitive thing.
</p>

<p>
	P.P.S. Advanced sages don't usually come out and say this so bluntly because they would be crucified by ignorant people for saying such things.

<p>
	Hey, ya'll, I need your help!
</p>

<p>
	I want to create a comprehensive list of video examples of prototypical stage Yellow thinking.
</p>

<p>
	This is not meant to humiliate or demonize stage Yellow. It's meant to be an educational tool for people learning about Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	So towards that end, scour Youtube and find all the videos you can which exhibit stage Yellow thinking. Try to find videos which are short and sweet. The more diversity we can display here, the better. Try to find examples from various cultures: Europe, Middle East, Asia, Indonesia, Japan, Russia, Africa, South America, etc.
</p>

<p>
	We will create a mega-thread like this for every stage in the Spiral, from Red to Turquoise. But here, let's just focus on Yellow. Each week I will start a new mega-thread topic for the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	Do not start a political debate in this thread! It is not our goal here to defend our personal political positions or to judge any stage, but simply to compile examples.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks for your help! I'm excited to see what kind of juicy stuff you dig up. Try to be selective with your choices.
</p>

<p>
	This can turn into a really cool list.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Yellow Values:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Nuance & complexity
	</li>
	<li>
		Openmindedness
	</li>
	<li>

			But you can't contemplate and imbibe Trump it looks like, even though you think you're so much more evolved than him. You wouldn't use such demeaning terms on a full red person even.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Because to take Trump seriously is to go too far. The proper response to Trump is ridicule.
</p>

<p>
	You don't engage someone like that in serious discussion because he is not an honest actor. He's a con-artist and he doesn't care about truth. So there can be no serious philosophical discussion with him or his ilk.
</p>

<p>
	This is not really judgment. Yes, it's my subjective evaluation. Trump is who he is and he cannot be otherwise. In fact, he is a facet of myself, so for me to demonize him would be just me demonizing God. Which is silly to do. But that doesn't mean I have go along with Trump's machinations. Trump is just very unconscious, and there millions of unconscious people all over the world. I can refuse to take part in their unconsciousness without making it a personal thing.
</p>

<p>
	For me to concede ground to unconsciousness when I know better would just be foolish. Whether you agree with me or not is not my problem. You are free to disagree with me and love Trump. Ultimately you have to learn to think for yourself. I am just presenting my ideas here.
</p>

<p>
	There is always a point at which you have to draw a line. For example, if someone comes to you and says, 1+1=5, you laugh him off. If you took every such case seriously, you would be very open to manipulation. People could just overwhelm you with false information to push their egoic agendas through. So there needs to be a firewall. The key is tuning your firewall properly so it doesn't reject legitimate points of view. It's always possible to miscalibrate one's firewall, but in the case of Trump, I'm not too worried about that being a problem. He's just not presidential material. This should be obvious to any unbiased observer. If you disagree, then we'll just have to agree to disagree and we'll see who wins at the ballet box in 2020.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, Infinity is not a concept, because concepts are finite.
</p>

<p>
	I mean actual Infinity. Which cannot be spoken because you are it.
</p>

<p>
	Calculus speaks of transfinite infinities, which are smaller infinities than the Absolute. I am speaking of what Georg Cantor called Absolute Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	See my 2-part series: Understanding Absolute Infinity
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Infinity is identical to what you call "life", "perception", or "physical reality" -- but you are not conscious of its true nature as yet.

<p>
	Hehehe....
</p>

<p>
	That's LIFE: A battle against entropy that we will all lose.
</p>

<p>
	That's not the issue. The issue is, HOW will you live life? What is the healthiest way to live? That's what Spiral Dynamics is about.
</p>

<p>
	Manipulation of the world must happen for life to live. The question, which ways of manipulating are the healthiest, the most sustainable, the least harmful?
</p>

<p>
	Even after enlightenment you will still have to manipulate life if you want to live.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Blue/Orange is opposed to weed.
</p>

<p>
	Case in point: Jeff Sessions has a hard-on for criminalizing weed.
</p>

<p>
	Legalizing weed will open the gateway for psychedelic experiences, which spells doom for the Blue & Orange paradigms. Orange doesn't like weed because it: A) hurts profits, B) undermines Orange's mindless materialistic ambitions, C) undermines capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	Weed will help Green win the progressive culture war. Which Blue/Orange doesn't want. Weed helps open the mind and heart. So a closed-minded, closed-hearted ego will not allow it.
</p>

<p>
	It's no accident that weed is legalized in the most developed Green countries and states in the world first. Alabama is not about to legalize weed. Because they are too Blue.
</p>

<p>
	If California is the head of the snake, Alabama is the tail.

	What is a strange loop?

			"And yet when I say 'strange loop', I have something else in mind — a less concrete, more elusive notion. What I mean by 'strange loop' is — here goes a first stab, anyway — not a physical circuit but an abstract loop in which, in the series of stages that constitute the cycling-around, there is a shift from one level of abstraction (or structure) to another, which feels like an upwards movement in a hierarchy, and yet somehow the successive 'upward' shifts turn out to give rise to a closed cycle. That is, despite one's sense of departing ever further from one's origin, one winds up, to one's shock, exactly where one had started out. In short, a strange loop is a paradoxical level-crossing feedback loop."

<title>The Vilification of Religion</title>

<p>
	The point is to realize that religion is just what happens when you try to spread mysticism to the whole world, but the world is largely undeveloped, so they fail to get it.
</p>

<p>
	An ignorant person cannot help misunderstanding mysticism.
</p>

<p>
	Just like an ignorant rationalist cannot help misunderstanding religion.
</p>

<p>
	In all cases, the common denominator is ignorance. Which we are all guilty of in spades. So who is to blame?
</p>

<p>
	Since all that exists is the Self, there is no one to blame but oneself.

			That said, almost everyone from my hometown (a small redneck town in Florida) are huge Trump supporters... including my mom who was previously into a lot of Green initiatives. And I was so disheartened when he won the election. I felt sick the whole week. I didn't know that my mom even supported him, and I never would have seen it coming. She'd never mentioned either.
		</p>

		<p>
			Then she came to visit for Thanksgiving a few weeks later, and I was excited to vent to her about it. But all I heard about all weekend was about how amazing Trump is and how "He's so rich that no one can buy him." and "He tells it like it is." And just thinking that his idea of a Muslim ban and the wall are awesome. And how closed minded and hyperbolic I was being by saying that his idea of police profiling Muslims and making them wear IDs was similar to what the Nazis did. Then, when she came for Christmas it got even worse.

<p>
	Hehehe... yeah. Blue/Orange really likes Trump. He knows just how to market to their fears and hopes.
</p>

<p>
	Meanwhile Green is horrified by the backwardness of it all.
</p>

<p>
	Much of American society is still Bluish. If you live in a Green part of the country like LA or NY, this is easy to forget. It's telling that NYers hate Trump, lol. They know his con-game well.

</p>

<p>
	Bernie Sanders seems like a healthy Green leader. There is a high likihood of a Green leader winning in the next election cycle as mainstream America sees the full ugliness of Trump's version of Orange America. It's going to turn a lot of moderate, mainstream people off. Trump is less consciousness than the average decent American.
</p>

<p>
	The entire culture needs to shift Greener. Which is why we have this on-going culture war. Blue/Orange does not want to shift Green. Hence it's so actively demonizing Green and fighting against it tooth and nail. Hence the rise of someone like JP, who's riding this wave.
</p>

<p>
	But Green is coming regardless. It cannot be stopped. #MeToo and weed legalization is sweeping the nation, and more of that will come. America still has yet to awaken to Green's opening of the heart.
</p>

<p>
	To me, it's not a question of IF, it's question of HOW LONG?
</p>

<p>
	It's gonna be interesting to watch it all unfold.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, in the end, Trump will be a good thing for mankind. We need Trump to learn the lessons of electing narcissistic morons.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this lesson will come with some great costs. As all lessons do.
</p>

<p>
	Trump's depravity is shedding light on many weakness in our institutions which need shoring up. We are lucky Trump is too incompetent to be an effective dictator. In the future, we might not be so lucky.

<p>
	I think TYT plays an important role. They have some good ideas and initiatives which are much-needed, like their push to pass a Constitutional amendment to get all money out of politics. That would be a game-changer, and is very much needed, and it's not even a partisan issue. Both left and right wingers should be for getting all money out of politics.
</p>

<p>
	TYT is certainly far superior to right-wing (stage Blue/Orange) propaganda outlets and talk show hosts like Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, Alex Jones, Breitbart, Fox News, etc.
</p>

<p>
	But TYT also increases the polarization in our politics. It adds gasoline to fire and it has its blindspots. And it tends to over-simply the right wing without really understanding it. Which ends up backfiring.
</p>

<p>
	A stage Yellow approach would be wiser, I think. We need a politics which isn't Democrat or Republican, but Spirocrat <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> But society hasn't evolved that far yet.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in the long run society will become more harmonious, integrated, and fair. As it has been for the last 2000 years. But not without some ego backlash and bitter battles. Tyranny never gives up without a good fight.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity necessitates war.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most profound things you can contemplate when you're tripping on LSD is: Why does war exist? What is the existential basis for all conflict? Be prepared to have your mind blow.

			Do you think (counterintuitively) demonization and volatility actually serves a purpose in moving us forward as human beings in Tier 1 of Spiral Dynamics, despite the fact that demonization is a sign of unconsciousness? Or do you think that it serves no purpose or detracts from our movement forward as a species?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a tricky topic because in the ultimate big picture, EVERYTHING serves its purpose. Cenk's demonizing the right has its purpose. White people lynching black people has its purpose. Nazis killing Jews had its purpose. Racism, war, genocide, slavery, anti-Semitism, rape, murder, theft, corruption, harassment, abuse, tribalism, etc. It ALL serves a purpose. It's all totally inevitable and part of Infinity. This is the bitter pill that no ego wants to swallow because the ego loves to judge and be self-righteous and to create an environment which aids the ego's survival.
</p>

<p>
	So if you're gonna say that demonization is moving us forward. Okay. But also realize, so did Nazi concentration camps.
</p>

<p>
	It will take some deep enlightenment experiences to accept that. It will not make sense to the ego-mind. The ego-mind is too selfish to see it. And the ego-mind will try to use this fact to further its agenda by saying things like, "Well, I robbed that person, but it was totally inevitable, like Leo said. So I didn't do anything wrong."
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is just ego being a sneaky manipulative snake. Which is also inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	Reality cannot be other than exactly how it is. The challenge for ego is to surrender to what is.
</p>

<p>
	By definition, anything that happens within reality, servers the ultimate purpose. There is nothing within reality which is "wrong" or "should be otherwise". You cannot optimize reality beyond what it is. It is already 100% optimal and anything that occurs is part of that opitmality unfolding. It just unfolds in counter-intuitive ways. Most people would not think that murder is optimal, but that's because they are not seeing the biggest picture. They are not thinking infinite moves ahead the way God does. So to them, stuff looks sub-optimal. But that is just ignorance. At higher levels of consciousness that will fall away and there will be total acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	This is the #1 reason why nonduality cannot go mainstream. This truth is too brutal for people to accept.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You wouldn't think it stupid if you were an oppressed woman with no voting rights and few legal or financial rights.
</p>

<p>
	You think it's stupid because it doesn't fit your ego's agenda. From your ego's POV, there's nothing wrong and no need for equality because you already have a decent position in the game.
</p>

<p>
	But if you were a woman in Saudi Arabia with no right to drive or open a bank account, you might feel otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	Or if you had a couple of daughters who get sexually harassed, you might start to see things differently. Now your ego will have some skin in the game. Now it will be personal for you, whereas before it was academic.
</p>

<p>
	What feminist movements are doing in action is creating more equal rights for women. On paper, they have all kinds of academic theories. But in action, women today enjoy many benefits the couldn't imagine 100 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	To understand feminism you have to step outside your male perspective. It ain't about you.
</p>

<p>
	I like this one because it shows how Blue/Orange demonizes Green, and then Green demonizes Blue/Orange back. So both sides end up vilifying each other without mutual understanding. It's tribal warfare.

	If I recall correctly the Google cofounders went to a Montessori school.
</p>

<p>
	Montessori schools are great if you can afford them.

<p>
	Guess who hates equality?
</p>

<p>
	Mr. Ego
</p>

<p>
	Equality will always be resisted by those whom equality seeks to level. The ego doesn't want equality, it wants control.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is a little tyrant. And no tyrant wants to be deposed. But in the end, the tyrant always loses. It just takes a long time and a lot of people get hurt in the process.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you are very right-brained.
</p>

<p>
	For such people, like myself, it can be very easy to understand something in a nonlinear, nonverbal fashion, but then quite a challenge to articulate it linearly. Because the truth is nonlinear, all linear explanations of it are partial and misleading.
</p>

<p>
	But with practice you can get good at articulating the inarticulable.
</p>

<p>
	Writing in a journal would probably help you organize your thoughts.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feminism</a>
</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself this: "How many books have I read on this topic?"
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of griping is that its a distraction from study, contemplation, and understanding.

	A) Your sits should be no longer than 60 mins each. Take short breaks. Get up and do some walking meditation.
</p>

<p>
	B) Hardcore monks and yogis sit through excruciating pain. Levels of pain you can barely imagine. This approach only works if you're really hardcore.

<p>
	Enlightenment is not an opinion or a belief.
</p>

<p>
	Either do the self-inquiry work, or don't.
</p>

<p>
	If you are interested in enlightenment, you do the work. You don't ask other people for their opinions about reality. Their opinions will not help you at all.
</p>

<p>
	Just like if you wanted to become a millionaire, you never ask people, "What do you guys think of millionaires? Are they real?" You go do the work to become one.

<p>
	Yeah, I've been there. I feel ya. Especially the breakups are hard.
</p>

<p>
	It's important, when do this work, that you don't make major life decisions too rashly.
</p>

<p>
	If you had a good relationship, then I don't really see a point in breaking it up unless you are just not interested in that any more and want to go 100% solo.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it will be hard going full-Buddha. Much harder than most people realize.
</p>

<p>
	Expect major ego backlash. Fast, dramatic, and intense is what you're signing up for when you go full-Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	It's not necessary to go full-Buddha. But maybe for you it's the right move. Only you can know what you're capable of.

<title>Is there objective reality without subjective perception?</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	There is no such thing as subjective perception. Ego appropriates the Absolute for itself, creating the illusion of subjective experience.
</p>

<p>
	Without ego, subjective experiences becomes recontextualized into the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Your experiences are not really yours. And they are not really experiences, but Being.
</p>

<p>
	"But Leo! I'm having this experience right now! I'm seeing the world!" << No! That is ego! The universe is simply being. The universe is not happening "to you". This life is not yours! The universe is alive without you.
</p>

<p>
	Without ego, what was always subjective becomes objective. Being has instant direct objective knowledge of itself via no mechanism -- DIRECTLY! Being is. Out of blind self-centeredness, the ego-mind mistakes Being for perception. It's like looking at clouds and always seeing rabbits instead of clouds because you're always looking for rabbits.

<p>
	The problem here is that you've got a highly skewed, demonized notion of what multiculturalism is about.
</p>

<p>
	Multiculturalism is about valuing diversity of human cultures, not holding your own as superior. It's about being curious about exploring other cultures and noticing how all cultural norms are relative, arbitrary, and socially constructed.
</p>

<p>
	It would help if you actually traveled abroad or deeply studied other cultures and saw the rich diversity that exists all around the world. This would open your eyes to whole new way of seeing humans, societies, and life.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you could travel to Costa Rica and see what life is like in a country which has abolished its army entirely. Costa Rica has zero army. And people there seem to be happy with it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't make this political. Politics is ego. Work to let go of your judgments. If you're judging a thing, that means there's something about it you don't fully understand.
</p>

<p>
	Great example of Orange gone Green.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue hates whistleblowers because it sees them as traitors to the civilization Blue is trying to build.
</p>

<p>
	And Stage Orange hates whistleblowers because they ruin profits and Orange's ability to manipulate.
</p>

	Perhaps Yellowish too. Hard to pigeonhole him.
</p>

<p>
	But he's definitely beyond Blue or Orange. Incredible level of integrity and selflessness this guy has.

<p>
	Friendzoning is independent of your Spiral color. Guys of all colors get friendzoned, and only because they are clueless about pulling the trigger and escalating.
</p>

<p>
	Friendzoning is never going to be a problem if you just learn a bit about flirting with girls.

</p>

<p>
	Try some LSD for a less twisted and less disorienting experience.
</p>

<p>
	The goal with psychedelics is to be able to contemplate on them. So you can figure stuff out rather than just being blasted into hyperspace -- which leaves you confused after you return.
</p>

<p>
	You wanna contemplate questions like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What am I?
	</li>
	<li>
		Where did I come from?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is intelligence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is another?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is language?

<p>
	Many women are naive and underdeveloped themselves. And also, Green guys are pretty rare. Most guys are Blue/Orange. And since women don't do pickup on guys, they don't have many choices a lot of times.
</p>

<p>
	An Orange woman is not conscious enough to realize that what she really wants is a Green guy. She will keep getting attracted to Orange assholes for a long time, until she learns her lesson the hard way.
</p>

<p>
	Like attracts like.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to attract a Green guy or girl is to become solidly Green yourself. Hang out where Green people hang out.

<p>
	Oh, definitely!
</p>

<p>

<title>Order of Steps to Self Actualize?</title>

</p>

<p>
	A person like that is going to have serious motivation problems. So you need steps which will get him engaged and mobilized. That will depend on what he really wants in life and what will motivate him.
</p>

<p>
	If he's a 30 year virgin, then coming up with a compelling vision could work nicely. Like a vision of him getting into shape, starting to socialize, and finally landing his hot dream girlfriend. That should probably get him engaged. But he has to start believing that it's really possible for him to do that, not just a pipe dream.
</p>

<p>
	A person so stuck will have A LOT of excuses for why he can't, why nothing ever works. Classic victim mindset. You gotta question all those excuses to death and draw that compelling vision anyway.
</p>

<p>
	A great vision is the key to motivation. A vision that really fits you. (See my Life Purpose Course for how to create a badass vision for your life.)

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The biggest trick with romantic love is that for it to really work, you have to convert it into Platonic love. Romantic love is usually needy love. You need something from the relationship which you lack. Platonic love is the love you GIVE, not receive. So the goal of the game is to make yourself less and less selfish, and to love more and more unconditionally without expectation.
</p>

<p>
	The big trap for women with this advice, though, is they become doormats for douchey guys who cannot appreciate unconditional love. And women use the excuse of "unconditional love" to stay in bad relationships and not enforce boundaries. You have to find a guy at your level who is willing to love back, and you need a boost up your self-esteem so you do not let the guy transgress over your boundaries. Then things should work.
</p>

<p>
	I know a Western yogi who's married to a hot wife. But he never has sex with her. It's purely Platonic. Of course he is enlightened and developed as hell, so he can pull something like that off. It also helps to be in your 60s.
</p>

There are people who I would classify as Yellow who don't know Spiral Dynamics exists.
</p>

<p>
	But learning Spiral Dynamics will super-charge your ascent and mastery of Yellow and help open you up to Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	Noam Chomsky is a Yellowish guy, and I don't think he knows about Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	Yellow just requires a passion for removing all biases from your perception of the world, and being able to explore diverse perspectives with radical openmindedness and neutrality.

They love the long-haired chaotic musician stereotype.
</p>

<p>
	A Green guy can easily steal a girl away from an Orange guy. Girls want emotional connection, not your Orange logic and business-suit.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse PUA emotional manipulation tactics with true emotional connection. PUAs are not able to build deep emotional connection. They just know how to manipulate her emotional buttons to create drama. Which works short-term, but not long-term.
</p>

<p>
	And 99% of Orange guys don't know pick-up, so they are the boring logical nerd guy who cannot get laid.

Orange looks for love externally rather than internally. Because Orange is materialistic, it treats love as just another kind of material.

Which will never work without direct experience of the Infinite.
</p>

<p>
	The Infinite IS the reconciliation.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot comprehend the Infinite via the finite. Duality cannot fathom nonduality. A discontinuous leap in awareness is required.
</p>

<p>
	All religion is an aping of nonduality.

</p>

<p>
	That's exactly right: your perspective is always relative. There is no such thing as absolute stages. Your ability to understand each stage depends on what stage of the Spiral you are at. And you ego will tend to cloud your vision of the Spiral until you get to solid Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Many of the lower stages will no be able to understand Spiral Dynamics at all, rejecting it out of hand, or misusing the model for egoic purposes.

<title>Spiral dynamics stages in women, stage orange and relationships, etc.</title>

<p>
	Some good insights there. I definitely could have said a lot more about women and relationships with respect to Spiral Dynamics. That could be an entire episode all on its own.
</p>

<p>
	Cliche examples of the Orange woman is a slutty club girl or a gold-digger wife who marries more for security than for love. Then she cheats behind his back with the fun, adventurous, romantic, artistic Green guy who actually makes her wet.
</p>

<p>
	Melania Trump seems pretty Orange to me. As is Trump's daughter, Ivanka.
</p>

<p>
	The female character in House Of Cards -- Claire Underwood -- is a great example of a manipulative Orange woman.
</p>

<p>
	Orange women like to wear business-suits and compete with the boys in the corporate boardroom. Orange women can feel like they have to compete with men in a masculine way, over-arresting themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Orange women are different from Blue women in that they often have their own big careers, like men.
</p>

			Is spiral dynamics a strange loop? (Haven't watched today's video yet but i have a feeling the more you go up the ladder the more you see below stages as unimportant. . . Like respecting the traffic in gta 5 . . . You might go red stage again if you know what i mean)

<p>
	No, it's a SPIRAL -- which is a vertically offsetting loop.
