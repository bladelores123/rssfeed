		<p>
			The reason I say this is because of the "Dark night of the soul" thing. People talk about going through this stage for years. I can't do that. I've read about enlightenment a lot and almost everyone goes through years of hell to finally reach it and then a couple of years later go back to hell. I've already seen too much to go back, so what am I gonna do? live through this dark period until I give up on everything in my ego, including my loved ones?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The Dark Night does not usually last for years. That is rare. Many people don't even get a Dark Night.
</p>

<p>
	When the Dark Night lasts a long time that is for people who have no theoretical foundation, no good guidance.
</p>

<p>
	By watching my videos and reading the books you should be able to avoid all that.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Giving up your loved ones will be necessary regardless. All loved ones come and go. They do not last forever. Enlightenment requires you to surrender everything, but after that you come back and can appreciate it that much more.
</p>

<p>
	Detachment -- counter-intuitively -- heightens your capacity to love.
</p>

<title>Counintuitive Video Question - Rules = Freedom vs Trascendent Morality</title>

</p>

<p>
	Rules are important for a society to function, but also rules must be well selected and you must understand why the rule was created.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between following rules consciously vs unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
	And rules in society are much more appropirate than a rule-based personal morality. Your personal morality should not be rule-based but heart and consciousness centered.
</p>

A tiny taste.
</p>

<p>
	You only skimmed the surface of the ocean that is psychedelia.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation will come naturally at deeper levels. You have to distinguish between contemplation which is artificial and contemplation which is organic. At higher doses you will be hit with organic contemplations without any need of writing down lists of questions.
</p>

<p>
	What's most important is just genuine curiosity about reality, not a list of questions. The list of questions is good to make, but you do that BEFORE the trip, and you don't look at it during the trip.
</p>

You gotta meet the person where they are at.
</p>

<p>
	Telling normies things like, "Nothing is real!" or "Who is saying that?" is just not skillful.

		<p>
			I agree with what you are pointing towards. The true self is all of reality, as it is right now. 
		</p>

		<p>
			OK Leo, but what do you mean by "creature" here? The idea that there exist external biological organisms which are centers for conscious experience is a concept which I cannot prove. You, Leo Gura, are appearing in my consciousness as a creature but I do not know that you are actually another conscious being. I am Leo Gura but I do not know if Leo Gura is conscious. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The falsehood of solipsism is a practical truth but when aiming for Enlightenment we want the person to stop conceptualising and abstracting all together. 
		</p>

		<p>
			To even say a statement like "you'll live forever" is extremely fuzzy verbal territory to root in actuality because implicit to that statement is notions of time when time is an illusion. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It does not make sense to you because you are not awake.
</p>

<p>
	If you woke up you'd immediately know that you are all creatures (and non-creatures) in the universe. This is not a theory or a conceptualization. It is the Absolute. But only if you awaken.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to become every creature to know this, you just need to wake up to what you are. To wake up is to become the entire universe and all objects in it.
</p>

<p>
	At the moment of awakening you realize that you will reincarnate infinitely, forever. Because you cannot die. This means the big Self, not the ego. The ego was a fiction to begin with. It never was. But the big Self takes on infinite forms.
</p>

<p>
	There are many good scientific articles.
</p>

<p>
	Science, by its very nature, is a collective consensus-building activity. So if you're gonna use science at all -- and what other choice do you have? -- you're gonna have to accept a lot of stuff as expert hearsay.
</p>

<p>
	So in this example you were just being too dismissive and smartassy.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, stage Green & Turquoise must build on top of stage Orange rather than excluding and denying it.
</p>

<p>
	Science denial is not a tenable position. What you can do instead is talk about various ways to interpret the science, various ways to recontextualize empirical data.
</p>

<title>Is shyness a belief or a truth</title>

</p>

<p>
	But the root source causing the shyness is falsehood. You are shy because you have fear. And all fear is falsehood.
</p>

<p>
	Uncovering why you are fearful in social situations will ultimately eliminate the shyness.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is overcome by understanding what it is you fear, why you fear it, and facing that fear.
</p>

<p>
	This is a very poor framing of the situation.

<p>
	Imagine if I convinced myself that my learning mathematics would hurt everyone I care about.

<p>
	A) That video is only one perspective, not the absolute truth. It showcases one facet of a complex issue.
</p>

<p>
	B) That video was primarily about language, but questioning, understanding, and insight goes way deeper than symbols and language.

	You will never get everyone on the same page, but that doesn't matter. It's like trying to get everyone to agree that red and crimson are the same thing.

<p>
	It's a quality problem to have.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually you'll probably get so over-stuffed with self-help theory that you will need to detox from it.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually, to deeply awaken, you'll have to let go of the desire for hoarding theory. But right now you might still be at the point where more theory is helpful to you. You'll have to play it by ear.

<p>
	I'm seeing a lot of misunderstanding going on here.
</p>

<p>
	Watch your projections and assumptions about enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is simply consciousness of the Absolute Truth. No particular behaviors or lifestyle correspond with this. Behaviors and lifestyles can vary greatly.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to be deeply enlightened be still be manipulative, abusive, addicted to things, etc.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Reality is not like how materialists think it is: an external static object. Rather it is a dynamic mindscape. How you use your mind makes an enormous difference in how you experience reality.

<p>
	Of course you should try to maintain as high a consciousness state as much as you can.
</p>

<p>
	This is transformation, this is growth. You will change and people around you will start to notice it and they will usually not like it because they expect you to be the old self. Become your new self anyways. Change requires the old dying to the new.
</p>

<p>
	A metamorphosis must happen. You are the caterpillar turning into the butterfly. Other caterpillars will not understand your new butterfly form until they do it themselves.

</p>

<p>
	In a high state of consciousness you will not be criticizing anyone. In the same way that you will not be doing violence in a state of high consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	This does not mean people aren't being dangerous fools. There are plenty of dangerous fools in the world. But criticizing fools is itself a delusion because fools cannot help being fools. The more proper attitude is to have compassion and understanding of their state of ignorance.

<p>
	I don't think these are impossible questions. I have found that all these types of questions can be answered. It just requires enormous levels of consciousness and lots of contemplating.
</p>

<p>
	It takes many years to answer them all. I don't yet have a satisfactory answer to what is understanding.

<p>
	I've found that psychedelics are the best way to answer these questions.

	You need to go deeper. The shallow version of these insights can feel empty and hollow. The deeper versions of these insights are full love, beauty, joy, and radiance.

	And also remember The Dark Night Of The Soul. You might be going through that phase. It will pass.

<title>Elon Musk, &quot;...nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week&quot;</title>

<p>
	There are times when I work a lot. There are times in life when you need to work a lot. But this should be done strategically, in bursts, not as a chronic habit in an attempt to avoid spiritual work (which is what Elon Musk is doing -- avoiding spiritual work).
</p>

<p>
	Work will NEVER make you satisfied. If work made people satisfied then Elon Musk should be the most satisfied guy in the planet. And yet he is clearly miserable. He has turned work into a neurosis.
</p>

<p>
	I find that if I work too much I start to feel like a robot and I lose my creativity and passion for life.
</p>

<p>
	The times I am most creative and connected to life is on my days off.

<p>
	I use the word contemplation somewhat differently than he does.
</p>

<p>
	He explains his version of contemplation in his book. It sort of includes concentration, meditation, and wondering. It requires extreme concentration. So extreme that it does not work for me.
</p>

<p>
	You need concentration so strong you can bore a hole through a brick wall.

<p>
	This means nothing. You are still totally lost in concepts. It does not mater what you believe, the fact remains that you are under the delusion of being a self.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking you are not a self is not the same thing as actually not being a self.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between thinking you are a millionaire and actually being one.

<p>
	No you don't! That's the point!
</p>

<p>
	You're grossly underestimating understanding and language.
</p>

<p>
	The point is: how do you know what a slap means? This requires a radical degree of intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know that the word CAT actually means that furry things sitting on the chair? It takes an enlightenment-like insight to get that!!! It's a massive epiphany to realize that CAT means anything at all. Intelligence is required.
</p>

<p>
	You might think, "But Leo, I can just point at the cat and say CAT and the child will know." No! No! No! How does the child know what pointing is? That already assumes a massive degree of meaning and intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Try pointing out a cat to a donkey. He will have no idea that your finger means anything. Pointing only works because you had a massive insight when you were young that pointing is possible.
</p>

<p>
	Do not underestimate how intelligent all of this is.
</p>

<p>
	Lol, you can't falsify truth!
</p>

<p>
	You're still not getting it. Enlightenment not an idea or a belief.
</p>

<p>
	You are God. I'm not saying that poetically or metaphorically. It is the case. You created the entire dream you call this universe. And now you're acting like you didn't. You cannot falsify this because it is true. All you can do is realize it or not.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not a sensation. And cause does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	Your mistake is that you think you can think your way out of this problem. But you can't.

<p>
	There is no such thing as "peaceful". What is good for you is bad for someone else. Even the Buddha cannot take a step without killing life.

<p>
	A single word is not an understanding of anything.
</p>

<p>
	The word CAT contains no understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Meaning is not something a word has. Meaning is the relationship of differences between words.
</p>

<p>
	I talked about this to some extent in my video on Deconstruction, Derrida, and Post-Modernism.

	The whole point of a good democracy is that it protects minority rights.
</p>

<p>
	In any other system the minorities would be killed or enslaved.

<p>
	The detachment isn't a bug, it's the key feature.
</p>

<p>
	Stay mindful of how the mind assigns negative meaning to meaninglessness.
</p>

<p>
	Try to see the good in this, the pure beauty of being.

</p>

<p>
	The Christians will say it's their clergy. The Muslims will say it's their most fundamenalist clerics. The atheists will say it's people like Richard Dawkins. The white nationalists will say it's their Aryan brothers. The post-modernists will say it's people like Jacques Derrida. The oil companies will say its their well-paid anti global warming shill scientists. The tobacco companies will say it's their tobacco doesn't harm people shill scientists.
</p>

<p>
	If the materialist scientists are given control of the government they will outlaw all religion, spirituality, and mysticism and you will be enslaved by robots, AI, and corporatism.
</p>

<p>
	See, you guys are underestimating the depth of this problem.
</p>

<p>
	Who is gonna arbitrate what is true and good? See, you assume truth and goodness is just an objective given, but it isn't, it's relative.

</p>

<p>
	That's called human history circa ancient Rome.
</p>

<p>
	You can't have neutral robots. There is no such thing as neutral. Those robots will have their own self-interest and will ensalve everyone else. Or whoever built those robots will just build even better ones to kill the old ones and enslave the other islands.

	I don't fit well on this map because I've done a lot of crazy psychedelics. The map was not designed to account for psychedelics.

</p>

<p>
	But there's something to be said for very deep seeing of the ox, even if it's just temporary, it still changes your view of the world. You're never quite the same again.

	But it sounds like an ideological thing, which isn't good. They will probably frame your experience in an ethnocentric stage Blue framework, which would be very limiting.

A whole pill is too much. It will be to stimulating for most cases. But 1/2 or 1/4th is just right.
</p>

<p>
	Try combining it with L-Theanine which should reduce the monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	1 whole pill of Armodafinil is like not even 1/20th as strong as a mild dose of psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	A decent dose of psychedelic will literally melt the walls of your room.
</p>

<p>
	A decent dose of 5-MeO will make you forget you or your life ever existed. You will expand to fill the entire universe.

</p>

<p>
	Probably not worth it if you can access pure synthetic 5-MeO.

</p>

<p>
	It was a moment of illumination or a minor samadhi. Your visual field becomes "divinized", you see the divinity of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I'm just guessing here.
</p>

<p>
	It was a tiny glimpse. This is just the tip of an iceberg. Much more spiritual practice is required to take this deeper.

</p>

<p>
	Usually people who get serious paranormal abilities have always has a psychic sense since they were young. It was just usually weak, suppressed, denied, or underdeveloped. Then it gets super-charged.
</p>

<p>
	I think most psychics start young. Which is why I say there's a strong genetic component. I doubt you'll become a psychic out of the blue one day in your 40s.

But, start with a baby test dose.
</p>

<p>
	Do a 10 day solo meditation retreat and then evaluate how you feel.
</p>

<p>
	You don't want to jump into giant life decisions without testing the waters. You want to have a realistic idea of what you're getting yourself into. The reality of living alone in the woods for a year are probably way different than your mind's fantasy of such.

</p>

<p>
	The first is some mild psychedelic clairvoyance, and the second sounds like sleep paralysis leading into astral projection.
</p>

<p>
	All that is just the tip of the iceberg.
</p>

<p>
	Of course weed makes you trip. If you did a true psychedelic you'd see material reality dissolve away.
</p>

<p>
	You are not inside in a physical world. You are inside a dream in the mind of God. The "physical world" and "your life" are just one kind of dream. There are a million others to explore.

	The two are not mutually exclusive.

	A leader can be legit spiritual and have siddhis and run a cult and manipulate people into sex.

<p>
	Hedonistic adaptation always kicks in in the end.

There is no darkness. There is only light.
</p>

<p>
	The darkness is not of the world, it is the projection of your not-yet-fully-illuminated ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	Ego-mind is still judging and still assigning negative meaning.
</p>

<p>
	You have not tamed the ox yet. It is bucking you off. Which is why it seems there is light and dark.
</p>

<p>
	All judgments of good and bad are delusion. That is what must be transcended. It will take a lot of work to transcend it.

You don't need to see such crazy stuff to have a powerful mystical experience. Mystical experiences can be sorta plain and ordinary.
</p>

<p>
	The coolest mystical experiences are when you realize that the room you're sitting in, is God. It's a profound recontextualization.

<p>
	Some people can. Depends.
</p>

<p>
	Before you make such sweeping claims you would have to run an scientific experiment to see what percentage of people that would work on. It certainly would not be 100%
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes spiritually gifted people assume that everyone is as spiritually capable as they are. This is just not borne out by the data.

They will help you sort all that shit out.
</p>

<p>
	It just isn't always a cakewalk. Sorting some of that shit out can be emotionally taxing. But that's all good. That's exactly what produces true growth. Even the bad trips are good in retrospect.
</p>

<p>
	You don't have to worry too much about bad trips. But you do need to follow proper protocol, ensuring your set, setting, and dosages are proper.

<title>The Illusion of Free Will, is life scripted?</title>

<p>
	The ego is not in control. But life is also not scripted.
</p>

<p>
	It's some weird 3rd category of thing. Something mystical, ineffable, and non-logical.
</p>

<title>How do I know if I've had a mystical experience</title>

Because once you have one, it is very obvious. It's something totally new that lies outside the realm of ordinary material human experience. It's an "impossible" experience. It will seem physically & logically impossible.
</p>

<p>
	Just as a hypothetical example: if you were sitting there eating an apple and it suddenly transformed into an orange. That would be akin to a mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	Or, for example, if you experienced what death was like and then you came back to tell about it. That would be another.
</p>

<p>
	There are MANY different types of mystical experiences. Seeing the ox is certainly one of them -- and perhaps the most important one -- but it is far from the only one that can be had.
</p>

<p>
	The fastest way to have a mystical experience is via psychedelics. Psychedelics guarantee mystical experiences. Mystical experiences are simply experiences which violate the laws of physical reality as you've come to believe in them.
</p>

<p>
	You don't want to get caught chasing mystical experiences, but on the other hand, having a few mystical experience is very important in order to show you that there's more to reality than meets the eye, and also to motivate you get more serious about the practices.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to be able to sustain meditating hardcore, year after year, without seeing some kind of results. You will get demotivated and quit. So do whatever is necessary to get at least that first mystical experience. If only just a long session of shamanic breathing.
</p>

<p>
	Results in spiritual work are important. Otherwise you will quit.
</p>

<title>Where to draw the line between being good to yourself vs over indulgence</title>

<p>
	This is a very tough line to draw. It cannot be drawn conceptually. You must find it through lots of trial and error and failure.
</p>

<p>
	You know when you are breaking integrity, violating your own high values.
</p>

<p>
	But what makes this so tricky is that blaming and berating yourself only compounds the original problem.
</p>

<p>
	Still, as a newbie, you almost can't help but do it.
</p>

<p>
	This is all part of the problem of self-control. I have an old video called The Problem Of Self-Control which is pretty profound.
</p>

<p>
	You must be both hard-working and disciplined, but also gentle and loving with yourself. Not any easy balance to strike.
</p>

<p>
	I also have a video called: The Paradox Of Development Self-Trust, and one called Freedom vs Discipline. They all touch on this topic to some extent.
</p>

<p>
	Interesting snippet from Wikipedia about Rick and Morty:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			"Rick and Morty has been described as 'a never-ending fart joke wrapped around a studied look into nihilism.' The series addresses the insignificance of human existence as compared to the size of the universe, <strong><u>with no recognizable divine presence</u></strong>, as described by Lovecraft's philosophy of cosmicism. The characters of the show deal with cosmic horror and existential dread, either <u><strong>by asserting the utility of science over magic or by choosing a life in ignorant bliss</strong></u>. However, as Joachim Heijndermans of Geeks notes, none of them appear able to handle the absurd and chaotic nature of the universe, as Jerry gets by through denial, and Rick is a 'depressed, substance addicted, suicidal mess.' Harmon describes Rick as a <u><strong>self-interested anarchist</strong></u>, who doesn't like being told what to do. He believes that the character's life on a larger scale has caused him mental illness and <u><strong>opines that 'the knowledge that nothing matters—while accurate—gets you nowhere.'</strong></u> Matthew Bulger of The Humanist notes that the creators of the series are trying to communicate the message that <u><strong>we need to focus on human relationships and not preoccupy our minds with unanswerable questions</strong></u>, in order to find a sense of purpose and live a better life."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Therein lies the problem.
</p>

<p>
	Classic stage Orange/Green, sucks all the magic and divinity out of life by misunderstanding nihilism.
</p>

<p>
	* Facepalm *
</p>

<p>
	The emptiness <u>IS</u> the divinity! Is the beauty! Is the joy! Is the meaning!
</p>

<title>Can Music trigger Mystical experience</title>

<p>
	Yes, music can have a powerful uplifting effect. Which is precisely why music is so popular.
</p>

<p>
	Most people don't understand that the reason they like music is because it gives them a tiny taste of that spiritual/metaphysical connection to reality which they don't even know is missing.
</p>

<p>
	Music is all that stage Orange people know of spirituality. Which is quite sad. But better than nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Music is watered-down spirituality for the vulgar and lazy masses.
</p>

<p>
	But you ain't gonna get enlightened by it alone. Think of it as a little boost to your spiritual journey.
</p>

<p>
	We had thumbs up buttons but I decided they were too distracting. The ego craves validation and keeps saying things just to get likes.
</p>

<p>
	Likes encourage a sort of group-think mentality where instead of evaluating the truth for a statement for yourself you abdicate that responsibility on the herd.

	Don't try to become one. Just expose yourself to stage Green people, books, videos, ideas, events.

<p>
	When I say the answer to all koans is Mu, I mean the ACTUAL Mu, not the word or the idea of it.
</p>

<p>
	Saying Mu while in ego-consciousness is pointless. You must speak Mu from Mu-consciousness. This is what the Zen master is testing for. Are you speaking from Mu-consciousness? Is Mu actual for you?
</p>

<p>
	Only if you are awake is Mu actual.
</p>

<p>
	When you are in Mu-consciousness, you will not even need to speak Mu to the master. Just looking at your face, he will know.

<p>
	Because all that anyone ever really wants, is love. The love of God which they are too scared to give themselves. So they seek shallow substitutes from external sources.
</p>

<p>
	Love is the greatest high in the world. It makes the ego feel complete.
</p>

<p>
	All you ever want in life is to feel complete. But this impossible for the ego to feel constantly because the ego is partial and incomplete by definition. So it steals love in little bits because it is not strong enough to love the entire world.
</p>

<p>
	What the ego misunderstands is that what it really wants is not to receive love, but to give love.

<p>
	That's correct.
</p>

<p>
	In the end you will be left in a profound state of not-knowing. That is enlightenment. It's counter-intuitive: You expect to gain knowledge, but you end up losing it. What you gain instead is being.

<p>
	They are pretty silly. In the end you're just better off wondering: What is existence? or What am I?
</p>

<p>
	The koans will make sense only after awakening.

<p>
	Yes, that's a good thing to realize, constantly.
</p>

<p>
	You find yourself in an infinite maze without any idea which way is up or down.
</p>

<p>
	Now the exploration begins.
</p>

<p>
	You already did. You have existed as all creatures at all times ever.
</p>

<p>
	Since there is only one consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And here you are experiencing what it's like to be this particular human creature. Tomorrow this human dream will end and some other will begin.
</p>
