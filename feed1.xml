Expect massively flakiness.
</p>

<p>
	A good way to test for flakes on the day of the date is to text her 1hr before you get in your car: "Doing some chores and then will head out." If she doesn't respond, you know she's gonna flake.
</p>

<p>
	If she's gonna go on a date with you, she needs to be responsive to texts.
</p>

<p>
	That's due to class similarities.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to use cultural disagreements to distract from class differences. So lots of simple-minded people end up supporting Trump for cultural reasons against their own class interests.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is clearly not going to help low income people because he's thinks they are scum.

<p>
	That's how it is. Takes a lot of practice to overcome that. Usually years of rigorous practice are required.
</p>

<p>
	This problem of boredom is existential. It goes very deep. It can't be avoided. The point of meditation is to face it directly, which creates suffering -- which is why hardly anyone meditates.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation is supposed to be so boring it kills you.

			Yet this is the tragedy of your situation: While you may be a world class scientist, and you understand all the physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms of red, you’re color blind and can only see on a greyscale. See, despite all of you’re intellectualizing and scientific investigation of this specific light phenomena, you’ve still missed a crucial component to what red *is* existentially. You’ve missed an experiential insight into what red is that no amount of science can help you with.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a classic example from philosophy of mind / phenomenology. Unfortunately even when you give that example, people still ignore it. Materialism simply discounts all phenomena as "subjective" and therefore insignificant.
</p>

<p>
	A materialist scientist will simply not understand how seeing the color red has any importance to science. "Okay, so even if I miss the color red, so what? Doesn't change a thing."

It's more important to mobilize the progressive base.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Bernie and Yang have some cross-over, which is nice.
</p>

<p>
	But Biden does well against Trump in polls.
</p>

<p>
	Warren would probably have the hardest time. But then again, caring about what Trump voters think/want is not a top priority. They had their chance, they fucked it up, and they show little remorse.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump voters admitted their error, then maybe we could have more sympathy for them. But as long as they act like assholes and keep denying any wrongdoing, no deal. There need to be consequences for electing terrible leaders. You don't get to elect a terrible leader and then come back the next time and make demands about how you're not getting enough of what you want, expecting everyone cater to your priorities.
</p>

<p>
	Catering to Trump voters is not necessary to defeat Trump.

			Green is not really like that, green would dish out everything equally because it demonizes any form of hierarchy altogether.

<p>
	I simply consider that healthy Green.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful holding demonization as a defining feature of Green. That's pathological Green.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Bernie has some elements of Yellow in him. It's hard to tell what the exact percentages are without knowing him more personally.
</p>

<p>
	To me he is the poster-boy of solid healthy Green.

<p>
	Love and forgiveness is the solution in such a case.
</p>

<p>
	What such a "test" is testing you for, is the breadth and depth of your love.
</p>

<p>
	If you fail the "test", that's okay too. You'll just suffer more.
</p>

<p>
	The cure to all forms of abuse is deeper self-love, both for the parent, the child, and the abuser.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive because when your survival is deeply threatened the last thing you want to do is love. It takes great wisdom, bravery, heart, and consciousness to be able to love in such situations. And therein lies the "test". Such situations reveal your true level of development. Highly developed beings are capable of embracing it with love. But of course this is rare among humans. We are a crude species.
</p>

<p>
	Deeper self-love is the cure to all trauma and injustice.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, I don't make a big deal about it. I'm just pointing out hidden consequences which you may not have considered to this action.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is more complex than just mind/body. There seem to be structures which persist between lifetimes. Suicide could affect those structures.

			It's not like the only way to exist is by being attached to an animal host, in our case it is being the homo-sapien bodies. It is like people have no confidence in their being and they rely upon an animal-host to exist, no matter how much pain/suffering this animal host gives to the Mind. Especially when your Mind advanced enough to not be "content" with whatever pleasures the animal host can provide, be it sexual, food, any other forms of carnal entertainment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In the ultimate sense, everything leads back to total oneness, so there is no problem. But it seems to take consciousness many incarnations to get there. I'm not saying suicide will damn you forever to hell. I'm saying it could be temporary set-back, slowing the overall process. There is nothing wrong with slowing the process, per se. It's all relative.

			Is it true to say that if many have committed suicide, it was indeed god's plan? How can anything go against god's will? If he gave us free choice, why should any choice be wrong?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	By definition everything that happens is "God's plan". But not in the simplistic sense of everything being predetermined. God's plan is a meta plan which includes your human plans. You have the freedom to make your human plans.
</p>

<p>
	No choice is right or wrong. Any choice you make is fine from God's POV. God has no desire to manipulate you and no particular desired outcome.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's imaginary in the same way a brick wall is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	The notion of "imaginary" is much more robust than most people think. It encompasses all of "physical reality". So just saying that something is imaginary doesn't automatically set you free of it.

<p>
	Nope. Humans clearly affect nature with our actions. Even if you decide to take no action, that will have an affect on nature. It is impossible to not take action. Even inaction is a kind of action.

			This is an exercise I do in one of my classes: I go to the chalkboard and tell the class I will ask them a question and I want them to call out ideas.  I then say “First I’ll ask the males in the class ‘Tell me all the actions you take on a daily basis to protect yourself from sexual harassment and sexual assault”. . . Silence. . . The guys look confused. . . They don’t know if this is a trick question. . . Sometimes I tease them and say “C’mon guys, don’t be shy - let it out”. Nothing. . . . Then I ask the woman the same question and they give rapid fire answers. I’m now writing as fast as I can on the board and can’t keep up with them.

<p>
	That's warm but doesn't hit the nail on the head.
</p>

<p>
	Your definition is not fundamental enough. It still requires activity like "recognizing" and "communicating", which is 2nd order stuff.
</p>

<p>
	1st order Love requires no action. 1st order Love is simply Being itself.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to think of it is like this: replace your notion that everything is made out of atoms to "everything is made out of love". Love is the very substance of physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	An exercise I like to do is to look at my hand and just remind myself that it's made out of Love. This reconnects me with Love, reminding me that it's more fundamental than an activity.

<title>Rate Your Current Happiness</title>

<p>
	As soon as you start rating happiness, you'll lose it.
</p>

<p>
	The proper answer is: who gives a fuck? Reality is whatever it is and you feel however you feel at any given moment. Don't confuse true happiness with mood. That can be a serious error.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to "lock in" a happy mood is very counter-productive. You are guaranteed to fail at that.
</p>

<p>
	If you want real happiness, stop caring whether you're dying or being tortured. Then you'll be happy. And nothing less than that will hold up.
</p>

<p>
	Karma is much more than fear mongering.
</p>

<p>
	This topic is too complex and advanced to discuss on a forum. You'd need decades of advanced spiritual practice to begin to understand such things and I'm nowhere near understanding all that.
</p>

<p>
	If you violently disrupt consciousness (via suicide), it's not unreasonable to expect a ripple effect which cascades from such an event, disrupting the evolution of consciousness. Don't think of it as a punishment, think of it as a natural consequence of self-rejection and self-hatred. How can consciousness continue its evolution if it hates itself so much it cannot even finish out one human life?

<p>
	That's a bit questionable. I'm not certain how much of Obama was Yellow or Orange/Green. It's hard to tell without knowing him more deeply.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, the higher a person is up the Spiral the harder he is to assess accurately because there is more uniqueness of expression at Tier 2.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie is definitely more progressive than Obama, so I see Bernie as a step up for American politics. He is certainly less acceptable to the mainstream than Obama. America has yet to elect a solid, powerful Green leader. Few people embody solid Green. It's one thing to dabble in Green, it's another thing to really master it as Bernie has.
</p>

<p>
	For America to elect a solid Green leader would be a massive step forward. And it would cause a serious backlash as well. Bernie will not be well tolerated by many people even if he is elected. Turbulent times are ahead as America is forced to go Green kicking and screaming. We need to solidify in Green before we start worrying too much about Yellow. Green is good enough for now.

<title>What is your perspective on RASA</title>

</p>

<p>
	I don't rank consciousness on any linear scale because I feel that would be misleading.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that just because a book is on my book list doesn't mean I agree with it 100%. If that was my standard the book list would be empty. I expect you to read books and evaluate them using careful and nuanced discernment. No book can be trusted or followed blindly.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that spiritual paths can be very unique. Don't try to follow anyone else's way. Make your own way -- whatever that entails. My way entailed psychedelics and I don't regret it.

<p>
	It happens all the time. Tens of thousands of times per year.
</p>

<p>
	But don't assume the "respawn" is free and clear. There is very likely an enormous karmic debt that comes with suicide. So avoid it if you can.

<p>
	No, it has it's value. We just need to be conscious of its limits.
</p>

<p>
	If it had no value I wouldn't have it on my book list.
</p>

<p>
	Try to be more nuanced in your thinking. Things aren't good or bad, valuable or valueless. It's all in the details.
</p>

<p>
	Tools of the mind need to be used properly to avoid traps and errors.

<p>
	A human being grasps and understands and deals with tiny portions of God. A human is like 0.0000000000001% of God and has that amount of power allocated to him/her. Humans thoughts affect reality, but in a very weak way.
</p>

<p>
	A human is like an App in an OS which has only been given access to a tiny percentage of the total system resources. It is not proper for a single App to have access to total system resources and root access. These limitations are there for your safety so you don't accidentally kill yourself and the entire Earth.

<p>
	These days YT is very over-saturated. You have no idea how competitive and manipulative marketing is. It's a blood sport. This is not a game. You are talking about money here. Tens of millions of dollars. People are ready to kill you for money. Never forget that.
</p>

<p>
	Internet success is highly manipulated behind the scenes in ways which most of you cannot imagine. It is a Wild West for hacking, spaming, bots, money exchanges, politics, deal-making, backstabbing, lying, manipulating, stealing, bribery, exploitation, etc. This is how business works. It's ugly behind the scenes. Do not assume that internet success is "natural". There's nothing natural about most of it.
</p>

<p>
	Many giant internet companies defrauded their way to success and all of it is kept secret, creating the illusion of "natural" growth.

</p>

<p>
	It's important to keep in mind that most humans beings have the consciousness level not much higher than animals. So this stuff is not suitable for most people.

<p>
	You feel that way because you are so needy.
</p>

<p>
	When you get a really clingy girlfriend you will see that it repulses you. You will start to feel disgusted by her and even have desire to abuse and exploit her. She will start to feel almost sub-human to you.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously this can get very toxic and dangerous.

	Good, this is called Wu Wei, or effortless action.

<p>
	Your spirituality is skin deep if it is forced, premeditated, or mechanical. The key is to make it a seamless activity of your whole life, your natural way of being.
</p>

<p>
	Spontaneous action from a place of surrender and presence is the goal of all our work.

<title>How to have Sociopathic levels of detachment with girls and dating</title>

<p>
	Of course awakening helps with detachment in profound ways.
</p>

<p>
	But if you can't teach yourself to attract girls I would not trust you to be able to awaken yourself. That's much harder.
</p>

<p>
	Start with managing the easier stuff.

<p>
	Before you go spending a lot of money on that, I would doing a comprehensive blood work, check your hormone levels, and get a heavy metal provoked urine test using DMSA and ALA.
</p>

<p>
	Heavy metal toxicity is one of the leading causes of ADHD and other issues like that. You need to test for mercury, lead, arsenic, etc. If these chemicals are in your organs/brain they can serious decrease cognitive performance and cause all sorts of other problems.
</p>

<p>
	Blood testing for heavy metals is not good enough. A provoked urine test is necessary using DMSA and ALA.

<p>
	Because suffering is false, same as fear.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason you don't like suffering is out of selfishness. So by trying to end suffering you are doubling down on selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to suffering is to stop caring about it. Stop trying to escape it.

<p>
	Actually I never said that.
</p>

<p>
	You certainly can become enlightened that way. I just consider it an inferior motivation.
</p>

<p>
	The soul's desire for Truth/Love/Union is a higher drive than the escape of personal suffering. The soul actually doesn't care about suffering. Suffering is irrelevant in the end since it is a finite and relative illusion.

<p>
	They are not the same spectrum at all.
</p>

<p>
	SD is a lot more modest and successful as a model. SD does not rank people in a simplistic fashion. It acknowledges that people are complex and occupy multiple colors across multiple lines.
</p>

<p>
	I notice that many of you here have not studied SD deeply. You have a very surface level understanding of it based purely on watching my videos, which is a problem.

<p>
	If you have been hurt in the past, that is understandable, but adding ego on top of the hurt creates a spiritual trap.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot overcome evil through hatred or judgment. Never, never, ever. Until you realize this, you will be stuck.
</p>

<p>
	The only solution to evil is Truth. And what you wrote above is not Truth.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not just based on one man's reaearch, and it's a complex model that doesn't assign people numerical values for awakening, and like I always say, you need to understand that it's relative and has its limits.
</p>

<p>
	SD is much more robust than a linear numerical scale for nonduality.

<p>
	You do not know the degree of awakening of any human beings. Just keep that in mind. That is what is true for you. Anything else are beliefs you have picked up from hearsay or your own speculations.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea how awakened Ekhart Tolle is, or Ramaji is, or anyone. And even the notion that you could know is highly suspect.
</p>

<p>
	Assigning numbers to teachers is a dangerous game.
</p>

<p>
	It's extremely important that you admit to yourself that you don't really know these things. Otherwise you fall into a delusion of thinking you know something which you actually do not know.
</p>

<p>
	If Ramaji's mind is corrupt, then his scale could be corrupt and you have no way of knowing that. You cannot just assume that his scale is accurate. To assume such a thing would violate the whole thrust of our work here.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, Ramaji's numerical rating of me was immediately incorrect. He rated me too highly and wasn't aware he did so.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot trust anyone in this work. No one! Not Ramaji, not Buddha, not Christ, not me.
</p>

<p>
	No, it is based on Ramaji's experience, which is hearsay/belief to you.
</p>

<p>
	You guys need to be a lot more accurate about identifying when a thing is belief/hearsay vs direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Awakenings do not come with numerical values attached. Lol. This is not even Ramaji's direct experience, it is something his mind is constructing.

		</p>

		<p>
			So, are there other places where I can go to meet new people or I should brake through my fears?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	You will ALWAYS have that fear. That fear is not going to go away no matter which location you go to.
</p>

<p>
	It takes 1000s of approaches to start to get fearless. Until then, expects lots of fear. Approach despite the fear.
</p>

<p>
	Bus, sidewalk, cafe, mall, store, school... it's all the same.
</p>

<p>
	If it looks wierd it's because your mind imagines it so, and also because you are doing it in an uncool/creepy way. When done well an approach is never creepy or weird, regardless of location.
</p>

<p>
	You can even aproach a kissing couple on a park bench and have fun flirting with his girl. It's all in how you do it.
</p>

<p>
	You can even approach while she is with her mother and father and flirt with the whole family! Again, this requires some serious skill, so don't start here.
</p>

<p>
	The best location to start is bars and clubs because you can get away with a lot less skill and there are 10x more opportunities so you can blow up interactions without worry. During the day time you need to be much more precise than at night. Day time presents much less opportunities so you gotta strike with precision and skill.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Normal and abnormal are purely relative.
</p>

<p>
	It's very possible that a baby might be born to an abusive mother who feeds him baby milk poisoned with lead so he will grow up with a brain full of lead which then causes him to become a murderer.
</p>

<p>
	This is all part of reality. In a vastly complex reality, all sorts of fringe cases happen.
</p>

<p>
	I have never said that everyone is saved in the way you imagine. A lot of people are born into fucked up survival situations which are totally "unfair" and "horrific".
</p>

<p>
	But all of this is still relative and does not diminish the absolute goodness and love of reality. Love entails freedom. And freedom entails horror. Love entails horror and "evil." So it all adds up in the finally tally. But any individual life can get totally fucked.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality does not promise anyone a good material life. Just the opposite, it guarantees that your material attachments will end in deep suffering. Which is the whole point of transcendence.
</p>

<p>
	No matter how good your life is, a day will come when you will be totally fucked. So transcend while you can.
</p>

<p>
	Tis a mistake to take such simplistic numeric scales seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening cannot be quantified or mapped on a linear scale.
</p>

<p>
	Furthermore, all of this is purely hearsay and goes against the core of this work, which is direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	You have no clue whether these scales are accurate. You are just taking someone's word for it, giving away your own authority.
</p>

<p>
	Watch out, this can easily become a deep epistemic trap which skews your whole worldview.

<p>
	By your logic, all presidents would have to be populists because otherwise they couldn't get elected.
</p>

<p>
	Yet most presidents have not been populists. So clearly non-populist candidates win often and populist candidates lose often.

</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice this is solved simply by over-satisfying your needs.
</p>

<p>
	So if you're needy with girls, go sleep with 10-20 girls and your neediness will drop significantly.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot just wish your neediness away.
</p>

<p>
	The process you go through to successfully sleep with 10-20 females will cure you of much neediness. But it will be challenging process. Don't expect it to be easy. You will fail a lot. And that's exactly what will beat the neediness out of you. Every girl you lose will teach you a valuable lesson. You will come face-to-face with the ugliness of your own neediness.

<p>
	Do the practices or do not. But do not speculate about metaphysical issues.
</p>

<p>
	All understanding about God must come from direct personal experience. All guesswork and speculation is wrong.

<p>
	Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of spirituality is to face what is true and face all of one's fears.
</p>

<p>
	Your father will never awaken so long as he fears seeing sinister astral beings.
</p>

<p>
	All fear is fear of one's own consciousness. And until this is full realized, one will never awaken.
</p>

<p>
	He should take psychedelics precisely because he fears them. What he really fears is himself.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	How on Earth can you reach such a conclusion from that set of facts?
</p>

<p>
	When you hear a phone call, you hear a phone call. That is it. It has no more meaning than that. The rest is your interpretation, imagination, and projection.
</p>

<p>
	"A phone call about a pizza means there must be a pizza somewhere and therefore an external reality" << This is your projection.
</p>

<p>
	What's real is PRECISELY what appears. If you don't see a pizza, it isn't. If you imagine there is a pizza, that's exactly what's true: you imagining a pizza. If you think there's an external reality, that's exactly what's true: you are thinking there's an external reality. But notice, thinking there is an external reality does not mean there is an external reality.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is exactly what it is. Nothing more, nothing less.
</p>

<p>
	A better analogy would be that every psychedelic is like a different musical instrument. You can hit the same notes using a trumpet, a piano, or a clarinet, but they will sound different.
</p>

<p>
	It's too challenging to describe differences in psychedelics using words. You must directly experience their differences to understand.

I dont believe in anything and how can I ever ? You can always be in states of pure delusion.
		</p>

		<p>
			Wether the brain exists or not - thats another question - but I'm 100% sure within this reality you can make some very specific cuts with a scalpel on a brain and that person will wake up thinking he is enlightened, met god, and will talk like the buddha. So you can not be sure of anybody - not big news - but how can you ever be sure that you yourself are not this person?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Psychotic states are no different really than "normal" states. Consciousness can take on an infinite number of states. All states are part of the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to access the Absolute is through direct self-realization. It is not even a process. There is no method. Either you are conscious of yourself as God or you are not.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is not a belief. It's happening right now.
</p>

<p>
	The point is not to enter some one true state. The point is to go meta and instantly realize the nature of all possible states, penetrating through them all.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is thinking of awakening as some kind of special state or position, when it is the transcendence of all states and positions. Once you transcend everything, there can no longer be a question about delusion or psychosis or "Is this real?" or "But how can I be sure?" or "But what if I'm wrong?"
</p>

<p>
	No! All of that junk is transcended. Not in theory but actually.
</p>

<p>
	It is in fact insane to believe there is a difference between reality and psychosis.

<p>
	You lack nuance, conflating absolute and relative domains.
</p>

<p>
	Just because there is an Ultimate Mystery doesn't mean we can't explain why there's shit in the toilet, and fix it.
</p>

<p>
	Your absolutist logic can be used to say, "Well, who really knows how the shit got there? It's all a grand mystery."
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe you just forgot to flush and are making up colorful spiritual stories to cover your ass.

<p>
	You have to take into account, though, that if all those 1000s of people didn't go on that cruise, they would be polluting individually back at home. Don't forget to take into account how much 1000 people shit, piss, eat, buy, throw away, etc. in one week back at home. Don't forget to factor in the cost of gas, oil, sewage, and water back at home.
</p>

<p>
	Just to stay alive requires pollution. How much do 1000 birds shit in one week?
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying cruise ships aren't wasteful, but context is important. Of course 1000s of people gathered in a small space will create lots of pollution.

<p>
	You don't need to have a child to understand how love feels and works.
</p>

<p>
	There is no fundamental difference between loving a child, loving a dog, and loving a car.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously a mother's love is self-biased because the mother chooses to love "my child" rather than a million other children on the planet. That why I call it selfish. But it's still love. Love is love. We're just talking about degrees of limitation.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you could also say that a mother's love is selfless in that she would be willing to sacrifice herself for her child.
</p>

<p>
	But the same was true of Hitler. Hitler's love was also selfless in this sense because he was willing to sacrifice himself for his love of his country and his race. But as you can see, that was a very limited form of love.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, much higher levels of love are possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's life. That's a tricky balancing act.
</p>

<p>
	You are God in human form, so you both seek the infinite and the finite and you're torn between the two. You are divided. You seek unity but you don't know how to get there so you grasp around in the dark and you are addicted to division, so every time you grasp you make another division, thinking it will bring you to unity.

<p>
	Survival is a never-ending tail chase. That's true. Survival's function is to constantly look for more advantage, regardless of how much one already has.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			What is the relationship to survival and love? 
		</p>

		<p>
			For example from a woman's/mother's point of view, how much of her love for her partner and children is survival and how much of it transcends that. Does she logically have to know there's a difference to transcend it? Or does love transcend it in itself. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Is love itself the structure? Can love not also be the content? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	These are tricky issues which are rooted in complex and profound existential dynamics that few people have any awareness of, and such understanding is not part of our shared culture.
</p>

<p>
	In the end everything is an unfolding of Love. But limited beings like humans get attached to limited forms of love and their capacity to love is very limited because they are preoccupied with survival and they are too unconscious and too selfish to love in the highest ways possible.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is just a limited manifestation of love. To kill another person to maintain one's survival is love for life. But it's a narrow, limited kind of love. Surrendering one's need/desire to kill another person would be a higher form of love.
</p>

<p>
	Selfishness is love! But a limited form of it. Selflessness is an unlimited form of it.
</p>

<p>
	A mother of course loves her children out of selfishness, self-bias, and survival, but this is still genuine love. It's just very limited.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem with limited and selfish forms of love is that they become an obstacle to much greater, unlimited forms of love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is all there is. It is the highest structure of all reality. At the level of the Absolute, structure and content become identical.
</p>

<p>
	We are Infinite Love. The trick is being able to live in alignment with that.
</p>

<p>
	Although, notice, "I want to improve my life" is itself a high-level structure which runs the whole show of how you go about doing this.
</p>

<p>
	It might turn out that the structure "I want to improve my life" itself needs to be questioned and gone meta on. Maybe striving to improve my life is a big part of the problem here? Maybe the very notion of "my life" is the problem?

			But the problem is that people can write me that "Language is enough and we dont need meditation and self inquiry because there are psychologists and with them you can go deep enough to core issues. So our culture right now is good enough! So you dont have to go beyond language at all."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is a very deep ignorance to correct in someone. A person who believes that there is no value in existential investigation is hard to convince that it has value. It requires serious inquiry to start to appreciate the limitations of things like language, science, psychology, culture, etc. Only very seriously openminded and curious people will go down that rabbit hole.
</p>

<p>
	Entire books could be written (and have been written) about the limitations of science, language, and psychology. It requires a lot of reading, research, and personal contemplation to start to see a big enough picture, then the limitations become glaring. Until then it will appear like there are no problems.
</p>

<p>
	In practice maybe just skirt around the issue. Rather than trying to convince people that science or language is limited, just teach them whatever helpful thing you want to teach them which is beyond those limits. If you teach people helpful techniques they won't really care if it's "scientific" or not. People are suckers for effective, practical techniques that can help improve their life.

</p>

<p>
	How are you using her for your survival? How is she using you for her survival? What is the "you" that is being survived? What is her "you" that is being survived?
</p>

<p>
	Manipulation is another sub-structure that will be important to understand in the context of relationships. Notice how you too manipulate each other constantly to meet each others needs. This manipulation creates a dysfunctional dynamic. Successful relationship requires becomes conscious of your manipulations and letting them go. That's a lot of work since you manipulate so much and you do it so seamlessly and habitually.

<p>
	So then you have what you want. Unless you don't want it.
</p>

<p>
	Get very clear about what you want and what the costs are.

	I didn't suggest that you to come up with theories. Contemplation/inquiry is not a matter of guess-work or speculation.

<p>
	You don't know that. You haven't even bothered to contemplate or observe what desire is. Maybe if you looked at it, you'd find out. After all, there it is -- in you. If you can't understand it, who can? After all, we're not talking about understanding moon rocks or kangaroos, we're talking about the desires you feel and act out every day.
</p>

<p>
	Is desire really unexplainable?

			Just like God. Perhaps desire is God?

<p>
	Everything is God. So that doesn't help you.
