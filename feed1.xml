<p>
	What you seek and don't know it yet, is AWAKENING.
</p>

<p>
	When you understand fully what reality is, you understand what death is. Death does not exist.

The search for meaning is directly the avoidance of emptiness. Because in truth, all meaning is illusion, and BEING is meaningless. The ego hates this. But the good news is, once the ego is shattered and total nonduality dawns, you will relaize that BEING is far more profound and superior to meaning.
</p>

<p>
	BEING is what you see on psychedelics. Now imagine if your whole life was like that. Your life would be so empty, it is infinitely full. And from this position of total selflessness, you can do anything and help anyone with ease and joy.
</p>

<p>
	Your intention to help people is great, you're just going about it too shallowly. If you really want to help people, awakening should be your top priority.
</p>

Nothing original here. It's just boilerplate libertarian dogma, based on a highly naive understanding of human nature, how social systems work, and government.
</p>

<p>
	Any libertarian system you envision will quickly devolve into a murderous and opperessive military dictatorship.
</p>

<p>
	There is a very good reason why not one single libertarian form of government has ever existed. And this is it.
</p>

<p>
	No human society functions on libertarian principles. And none ever will.

</p>

<p>
	You are stuck in the rat race. So of course stress would be normal with that. Your entire lifestyle is materialistic and fear-based. That's understandable. You are just trying to survive. But it isn't how you would choose to live if you became deeply conscious of what reality is.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying to drop everything and quit. I am just saying that as you become more conscious, your lifestyle will change to be slower, less forced, more healthy. And then the stress will be less of an issue.
</p>

<p>
	Underlying this entire pursuit of survival is a deep sense of inadequacy and fear of emptiness and death. All of that seems like it's normal and "just how life has to be", but that isn't true. You can learn to live conscious and healthy. But explaining how is too much for a forum post. That requires a lot of research and trail and error to figure out.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, some fun gossip about David Deida.
</p>

<p>
	I once went on a date with Tony Robbin's copywriter. She knew all the dirty secrets. She told me that Tony Robbins had to physically kick David Deida off his cruise ship because he was getting handsy with Tony's wife. Lol
</p>

<p>
	Oh the delicious irony of it all...

</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	It only makes sense in the naive mind of a libertarian.
</p>

<p>
	You realize, right, that in international waters there are pirates who will murder your community, right? So those gunboats = military = government = taxes.
</p>

<p>
	Your offshore community will turn into a drug-addled dictatorship with rampant murder, theft, rape, and enslavement. And at the helm will be a self-proclaimed narcissist who claims to be the second coming of Christ, divinely ordained to "keep the peace" and spread his brand of spirituality across the land at gun point. Until the US government sends bombers to nuke your little offshore cult. And that will be the end of that sorry little chapter in history.
</p>

<p>
	When you don't have a direct consciousness of how ego works, you will get yourself into pickles like this.

<p>
	Yes, in a free world, humans create governments to murder each other.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever liberatrian society you construct will be conquered by a neighboring government which doesn't care a damn bit about your libertarian ethics.
</p>

<p>
	No one cares what you agree with. That's the point. Power is exerted without your agreement. It's utterly childish to not understand this basic point of life and human nature.
</p>

<p>
	In a perfectly libertarian state, one group of humans will band together, create a corporation, conquer and enslave the rest of you libertarians, and the end result will be military autocracy, until the people revolt back, overthrow the enslavers, and establish a democratic government which mandates civil rights and property rights for all citizens equally, and enforces any violations of this mandate at the point of a gun, using taxation to finance that gun.
</p>

<p>
	So the end result of libertarianism is already what we got: government mandated democracy. All you're advocating without realizing it is an devolution back to the times of ancient Rome, where 45% of the Roman population were slaves.

<p>
	That's only because they don't know how to use them properly.
</p>

<p>
	I have successfully use psychedelics to become conscious of every facet of nonduality. Total nonduality, beyond anything humanly imaginable. So much nonduality, that I see most enlightened masters now as not fully realized.
</p>

<p>
	David Deida, for example, is not fully realized.

<p>
	Enlightenment is the realization that you have always been dead.
</p>

<p>
	No one was born. Nothing is happening.
</p>

<p>
	The confusion about this comes from that idea you have of death as being "lights out." That is not death. That is your materialist idea of death, which turns out to be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Death cannot make sense from the materialist paradigm. It only makes sense once you're dead.
</p>

<p>
	No self = death
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha was a man who sat under a tree and meditated for so long that he died. But then his body kept on living and teaching for another 40 years. How that is possible you cannot understand so long as you are alive.
</p>

<p>
	To awaken, is to awake up from life, in the same way that you can wake up from a bad dream to realize it wasn't ever real.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Life Is A Dream

<p>
	Emotional responses vary WILDLY. Obviously the person stealing, murdering, or enslaving isn't having an emotional response against it.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is that you cannot rely on emotional response alone to make people behave ethically. You cannot rely on Hitler having compassion which stops him from sending children into ovens. The whole point is that Hitler lacks that compassion. As do millions of other humans.
</p>

<p>
	Taxation is theft only under an absurdly egocentric worldview.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with libertarianism at its core is that it is based purely on egocentrism. The fantasy of libertarianism is that everyone is a free and sovereign individual. That has NEVER been the case. You are not an individual. You are infinitely related to everyone else in your community, whether you like it or not. Your survival depends on them. Humans have never survived or existed as individuals. Even Neanderthals were tribal. Even our chimp ancestors from 5 million years ago were highly tribal and communal. There is so such thing as an individual chimp who does not pay his fair share of taxes. All chimps pay the equivalent of taxes or they are kicked out and left for dead.
</p>

<p>
	Humans are a communal species with communal obligations. Your job is to accept that rather than concocting an ideology to rationalize it away.
</p>

Why can you not just still comfortably with the stress? Why are you running away from it?
</p>

<p>
	Notice that if you sit down with any negative feeling, there will be a kind of agitation there, and it will feel "lonely" for lack of a better word, facing it.
</p>

<p>
	Just having a bunch of stress in your life is not the same thing as addiction. If you just have lots of stress, that's already a symptom of some deeper problem in your life, and chances are really good that that deeper problem is only a problem because you are afraid of facing emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	Example: You are stressed about finishing all your school work because deep down you are afraid of failing school and ending up with nothing -- AKA emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	Example: You are stressed about pleasing your husband because deep down you are afraid that otherwise he will leave you, and you will end up all alone -- AKA emptiness.
</p>

He is deluded with ego. He's got a really really bad case of rationalism.
</p>

<p>
	Stay away from ideologies like that. It is just a modern version of religion. It's everything I've warned you guys about in my epistemology videos.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "universally preferable behavior". That is an egotistical fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	These ideas are so wrong, it's hard to even know how to start curing a mind of them.

<p>
	Yes, but behind this stress is something even more real: emptiness!
</p>

<p>
	You can't stand stress because it feels too bleak and empty to face all alone, so you want a companion for that emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	The reason it's hard to tolerate that stress very mindfully is because there is an emptiness to it.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is always looking for movement and agitation because otherwise the stillness is too much to bear. It's too "real". So you seek escape from the suffering of emptiness into pleasant emotions. Because your mind is addicted to stimulation.
</p>

<p>
	The value of understanding a problem at its root is that you stab the hydra in the heart rather than merely chopping off one of its many heads.

<p>
	Guys, careful not to treat Kriya yoga as a quick enlightenment fix. That's not at all how it works. You need to be in this for the long-haul.
</p>

<p>
	Questions such as: "Do you see a light yet at your 3rd eye?" are the totally wrong attitude.

</p>

<p>
	I will shoot a video that destroys libertarianism at some point. It's so simple-minded and wrong that it's like an absurd joke.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as the non-aggression principle or morality or ethics AT ALL! Reality has no rules. Any rules you see, humans invented.
</p>

<p>
	The reason the non-aggression principle doesn't work, has never worked, and will never work is because there is normative reason why everyone should obey it. Animals obviously do not obey it, and nor do humans. You can act moralistic and self-righteous by claiming the the non-aggression principle, but then some human can always come and kill you, rape your daughter, and take your property. The whole point is that no one cares about your moral principles except you, because you invented them to suit your ego.
</p>

<p>
	Property doesn't exist, BTW. It's a human invention. As are all moral codes. They are all groundless and untenable. The only thing that enforced property rights is government, at gunpoint. And even then, it's not guaranteed, so don't take it for granted. Someone can always steal your property. I had $24,000 stolen from me, which I couldn't recover even after winning a court trial. The only way to get it back would be for me to go to the guy's house and beat down his door with a gun. And even then, he probably won't have $24,000 in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
	Drop this libertarian ideological game and start doing real self-actualization work. All of that Stefan Molyneux stuff is pure egotism and it seriously hampers your ability to do consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	It's childish. Just drop it. Thank me later.
</p>

<title>What parts of religion/ spirituality are real?</title>

The only way you can find out is by doing your own personal investigation with direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	No matter what anyone tells you, it will just be hearsay and stories from your perspective until you directly experience it for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about exploring the outer limits of reality, you should watch my episodes about epistemology very carefully and apply the principles taught there. The #1 principle to all serious investigation of reality is: be radically open minded to anything and everything. Don't judge. Seek to verify every claim with personal direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be amazed at how far that one principle can take you, if you bother to apply it seriously, and you are genuinely curious to know the TRUTH.
</p>

<p>
	Asking about such things on an online forum, or debating such things with people, shows a lack of seriousness and a gross underestimation of the nuances and complexities of reality.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to ask, but don't expect any serious resolution of your existential questions via an online forum. The things you are asking about cannot be spoken of or even thought about in many cases. You need to start to appreciate the depth of this communication gap.
</p>

<p>
	You can start by reading all of the 5-star rated books on my book list -- especially in the Consciousness, Epistemology, and Paranormal categories. That will give you an good theoretical foundation to follow up on with direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	To answer all of your questions will probably require 10-20 years of serious spiritual practices. Just so you understand the depth of what you're asking about.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	An additional point of clarification:
</p>

<p>
	Some of you guys pounce on each new technique I share as though it was the silver bullet to solve all of your problems. That is the wrong attitude. Doing a self-help technique once or twice and expecting something miraculous to happen is the wrong attitude.
</p>

<p>
	I never said that this technique will produce enlightenment. That is not its goal.
</p>

<p>
	This technique is not a replacement for meditation, yoga, or self-inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	Deep psychotherapy can take years and costs tens of thousands of dollars. So if this technique can speed up that process by even a factor of 2x, all in the comfort of your own home, that would a huge thing.
</p>

<p>
	Then how do you explain that Sadhguru and Peter Ralston both have daughters? And Shyama Lahiri (founder for Kriya yoga) was a householder with kids?
</p>

<p>
	Careful with making broad-sweeping narratives about enlightened people. It tends to be as problematic as making general statements about any group of people (black, white, Asian, gay, women, etc).

	And different techniques resonate for some while not for others.

<p>
	Who's to judge what is and isn't earned?
</p>

<p>
	You think your "hard work" is of your own doing??? You think somehow it isn't a gift from God? You think you stumbling upon yoga or meditation was your own doing and not a gift given to you? Such egotism!
</p>

<p>
	Be careful acting as though you have a choice in how things unfold. You don't. "Earned" vs "unearned" is an egoic notion. Everything is the manifestation of Infinity and could not be otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	Be grateful for any higher consciousness you come across, however it comes to you. Otherwise, it's like you're spitting in the face of God for giving you a gift. (Of course, you're free to do that too.)
</p>

<p>
	P.S. While you're at it, you may as well stop meditation, self-inquiry, and yoga, because those are also "unearned". You stole those techniques from other people who invented them the hard way. You are just riding on their coattails like a lazy bum, looking for a shortcut to God, too weak-willed to carve a unique path through the jungle of delusion for yourself <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>

<p>
	Awakening is just nihilism fully realized.
</p>

<p>
	If McKenna sounds "nihilistic" to you, that's because that's the way YOU are reading him.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse lack of sugar-coating with "nihilism".
</p>

<p>
	There is a certain compassion (masculine compassion) that comes with being ruthlessly blunt about a matter, as opposed to glittering it up with promises of 72 virgins. The ego-mind tends to hate direct Jihad. It's too much for an ego to stomach unless one is really spiritually mature.
</p>

<p>
	But also, keep in mind, that people will have different journeys to awakening. For some people the journey will be very hellish and bleak, for others it will be more heavenly and lovey-dovey. That's gonna depend a lot on your personal karma and how your mind interprets the journey.
</p>

<p>
	Also, keep in mind, there are many degrees of awakening. Certain levels may be sweet while others bleak. Again, depending on how your mind interprets it. For example, some minds will find it horrifying to discover that there is no right/wrong, while others will find this delightful. Some minds will find it atrocious to discover that God is nothingness, while others will find this beautiful.
</p>

<p>
	If that's true, how can you be sure you're not insane right now?
</p>

<p>
	Have you forgotten that THIS experience of reality you're having right now is determined by the brain? What if your brain is functioning ignorantly RIGHT NOW!?
</p>

<p>
	Hint: It is! You are mentally ill and you don't even know it. Your mental illness is otherwise known as materialism. Of course the whole trick with being afflicted with this illness is that you deny that you have it <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	So take your own advice. The problem isn't that you're being too skeptical here, but that you're not being skeptical enough! You are blinding accepting your default level of consciousness. Which is a massive epistemic blunder.

<title>Shamanic / Holotropic Breathing Mega-Thread</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	A few pointers for you guys:
</p>

<p>
	1) This question of whether oxygen is being increased or decreased is really irrelevant. Don't get hung up on that. What matters is if you feel the technique working for you. If you feel like it is harming you, then don't do it. For me, it feels healing. Obviously people can have all sorts of health conditions which might make this technique inappropriate, in the same way that running 2 miles on a treadmill is inappropriate for many people. But for most healthy people, it is healing.
</p>

<p>
	Medical doctors and academics can say all sorts of things. But the proof is in the actual doing of the technique. Do not listen to people who have not actually done the technique. Spiritual techniques tend to be hardcore. They can also be counter-intuitive, breaking conventional medical, physiological, and materialist paradigms. Case in point: most medical researchers still do not understand psychedelics for example, so don't expect them to understand a technique like shamanic breathing.
</p>

<p>
	With naive thinking, a doctor could easily classify running a marathon as unhealthy and physically dangerous, pointing to isolated factors like: "There is less oxygen in the blood than normal" or "There is more CO2 than average", "The muscles are producing lactic acid which is damaging to the body", "The heart beat is near heart attack levels", "The body temperature is near fever levels", "Dehydration is too high", "The immune system is under great stress", etc. This doesn't say much. Normality is no sign of health, and doctors usually just parrot whatever medical ideology they are subscribed to. They have zero spiritual understanding. Their understanding of human physiology is materialistic, crude, and linear. They have no sense of the subtle, energetic, psycho-somatic, or metaphysical aspects of human physiology.
</p>

<p>
	2) Don't fall into the trap of mistaking difficult emotional and physical sensations as "negative" or a sign of physical damage. It's very easy for a noob to misinterpret muscle burn at the gym as a sign of physical damage, for example. A little bit of pain can make the ego come up with all sorts of excuses. Your shadow and emotional trauma are wired deep into your mind, brain, and body. Releasing this deep trauma can feel painful, uncomfortable, difficult, scary, etc. Negative emotions arising is a sign of HEALTH, not sickness. It means the technique is working just as it should. This is called spiritual purification, and any serious spiritual technique has the potential to release very deep, painful, and scary thoughts and emotions. Facing your own lies, delusions, and ego-death is not rainbows and butterflies. With that said, you need to learn to intuit how much spiritual purification you can handle at a time. Going overboard is not good. Make sure you only bite off as much as you can chew.
</p>

<p>
	3) If 30 minutes of this techniques brings up a lot of physical challenges, pain, and emotions in you, then all that probably means is: you have a lot of emotional baggage to work through. For me, for example, 30 minutes of this technique feels intense, but there is no negativity, no pain, and little emotional baggage arising. For me, 30 minutes feels rejuvenating and empowering. It feels like an intense workout. Perhaps akin to running a marathon.
</p>

<p>
	4) Don't judge a spiritual technique unless you've actually done it with an open mind.
</p>

<p>
	5) Keep in mind, the ego is very sneaky. Any technique which directly threatens it, it will tend to demonize and reject. This is true of psychedelics and many other radical methods.
</p>

<p>
	6) The more effective a spiritual technique is, the more challenging it will be, and the less your ego will want to do it.
</p>

<p>
	7) Use common sense. Don't hurt yourself. Search your heart for whether this is healing or hurting you. As an example, after an intense workout at the gym, you should have a sense of whether you hurt yourself or strengthened yourself with that session.
</p>

<p>
	I am no doctor and this is not medical advice. You are 100% responsible for your own well-being. I like to practice hardcore and experimental techniques which may not be suitable for certain people. If you want to be 100% safe, then stick to 100% conventional materialist techniques (which basically means: no spirituality for you).
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality always involves some degree of danger and risk. You have to determine for yourself what you are comfortable with and how deep you're willing to go. If you think that meditation or yoga cannot get as intense as shamanic breathing, that's just because you've haven't really experienced hardcore meditation or yoga yet. And certainly this shamanic breathing is peanuts compared to a deep psychedelic session. I've done psychedelic sessions in which I've physically died. Good luck explaining that to a doctor.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, any technique that can produce ego-death or awakening is capable of eliciting in you deep fear and powerful emotions. Because are are literally facing your own death. That is no small thing.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality takes courage, but also intelligence. Be fearless, but also don't do anything stupid like physically harming yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You can call it hyperventilation if you want. But then by that logic you can also call awakening insanity. So what? You could also call weightlifting: tearing of your muscles. And you could call sex: exposure of your immune system to foreign diseases. And you could call eating a slice of pizza: ingesting cancer-causing poison.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's good. That's the only way really. You must doubt everything until nothing remains.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is like extreme skepticism taken to its ultimate conclusion, consuming everything, and even itself. Until only pure being remains.
</p>

<p>
	Trusting me is not what I ask you to do. I ask you to be skeptical of everything equally, especially of your self.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot trust anyone in this work. Not me, not any guru, not Buddha. You must discover what is true in your direct experience. Direct experience is all that really matters. My words are only here to motivate you to look more closely at your direct experience and question everything society has taught you.
</p>

<p>
	There are no authority figures. The truth cannot be spoken or proven to you. You must seek it out all alone.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you don't mistake my talking for truth. All the ideas I fill your mind with are NOT the truth!
</p>

<p>
	There are no guarantees, but Stan Grof has been teaching similar techniques for many years, with thousands of people participating. If it really damaged your brain, I'm pretty sure he would stop teaching it and people would have sued him long ago.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to know is to try it gradually for yourself. You will feel if it is hurting you or healing you. Just don't ask the question from a fear-based ego-mind perspective.
</p>

<p>
	I don't feel any damage from it. But you guys are all reporting unqiue experiences, so I can't guarantee your health.
</p>

<p>
	This is stuff that requires a willingness to experiment in a careful manner.
</p>

<p>
	What's nice about this techique is that you can make it as gradual as you like and stop at any time, unlike with psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Hehe...
</p>

<p>
	You can't know until you achieve it. For all you know, everything I say could be a lie.
</p>

<p>
	Such is the nature of all breakthroughs.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot do research unless you are willing to assume the risk of deadends.
</p>

<p>
	Now you see why so few people discover the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. 1000 hours is actually a very small investment. You should be prepared to invest way more than that if you really care about knowing the origin of existence.

<p>
	There is a difference between people attacking you vs you "creating enemies." Enemies are a psychological creation of the ego-mind. People who attack you will of course always exist. 
</p>

<p>
	A shark can attack you while you are swimming in the ocean. But that does not make him your enemy, unless you hold him as such.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake would be to go on an ideological crusade against sharks. That's the lesser Jihad.
</p>

<p>
	Be very mindful of anyone who you follow in the media who is waging an ideological crusade against anything. Notice that that entire thing is a distraction from consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	All ideology is antithetical to truth and consciousness. And there are many very subtle forms of ideology floating around. We're not talking about fundamentalist religion here. The ideologies you should be worried about are much more subtle.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	All ideology is going to limit your growth.
</p>

<p>
	People such as Peterson and Sam Harris are actually ideologues. Which is why they develop sorts of cult followings. It's a modernized form of religion.
</p>

<p>
	People with strong opinions betray their lack of consciousness and understanding of reality.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become, the less opinions and enemies you will have.
</p>

<p>
	Constant criticism, debating, and self-justifying are sure signs of low consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If an ideology or worldview appeals to you, you should be extra wary of it.
</p>

<p>
	There are hundreds of different ways to embody spirituality in your career aside from teaching.
</p>

<p>
	The reason your mind is stuck on teaching as the only option is because you're being lazy and not thinking outside the box.
</p>

<p>
	Monkey see, monkey do. Be more creative.

</p>

<p>
	The only strategy that matters is that you actually turn inside and look at your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	The rest is games.
</p>

<p>
	You can become enlightened sitting on your couch. If you would only discipline yourself and rivet your attention on: What am I?

<p>
	After failing to do so, Sadhguru goes mahasamdhi.

</p>

<p>
	Murder, rape, incest, drugs, genocide, racism... whatever. It is all part of reality and in fact an action of God.
</p>

<p>
	That is an extremely important point to understand. Until you understand this, you will never become deeply spiritual because you are not yet conscious of how your mind constructs these rules.
</p>

<p>
	If you reject evil, you in fact create evil. The solution to evil is to fully love it. The problem of exploitation is not solved with judgment or suppression, but LOVE!
</p>

<p>
	You want to realize and embody Divine Love. As your ego dissolves, what is left in its place is pure love for everything, and that's when your actions become truely moral. Morality is not about rules, it's about acting Good for no reason whatsoever, because it comes from your heart.
</p>

<p>
	Why would you want to use a girl for sex? Why not love her without necessarily marrying her?
</p>

<p>
	Sex is something you two can both enjoy. In fact, good sex is one of the greatest things a man can gift to a woman. Learn how to really please your girl in bed, and she will love you for it.
</p>

<p>
	Follow your heart, NOT rules from authority figures. Your heart is more powerful than all the rules in the world. When your heart is strong it allows you to overpower all of your selfish fearful egoic impulses.
</p>

<p>
	Rules are designed for heartless people.
</p>

<title>disproving absolute infintiy with thought experiment</title>

</p>

<p>
	1) The world is not nearly as rigid and predictable as you think. Take 2 tabs of LSD and see for yourself. Or just consider your dreams at night.
</p>

<p>
	2) Infinity includes an infinite number of predictable worlds. There is nothing you can think which is not found inside Infinity. You are hallucinating a predictable world. Which is no stranger than hallucinating an unpredictable world.
</p>

<p>
	3) Infinity is beyond all thought experiments. So all of this is just mental masturbation. Infinity is a brute fact. You cannot argue with what is. You can only become aware of it, or fail to do so. A brute fact does not hinge upon your thought experiments or reasons. Your mind is trying to make sense of God, and that will never work.
</p>

<p>
	If you still think God is something else than you, you haven't got it yet.
</p>

<p>
	It's best not to talk about God unless you have a direct experience of it.
</p>

<p>
	Quoting scriptures just doesn't cut it.
</p>

<p>
	Indeed, the only one you can worship or pray to is yourself. Whether you want to do so, it up to you.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate egotism is thinking God is Infinite, but that that infinity somehow excludes you.

<p>
	Zen monasteries already have such a test. They require that you get a written letter of recommendation from a friend of the monastery, then you must come to their gate and beg to be admitted. They always deny you. You must sit at the gate steps for 24 hours while they keep rejecting you. Eventually they let you inside the gate. Then they put you in the storage closet for a week and tell you to sit there and meditate without talking. If you complete all that, then they accept you.

<p>
	After your cognize God, you will know what the word means. Until then, you do not know. Not even close. All ideas of God are wrong.
</p>

<p>
	I am not speaking hypotheticals here. I am speaking of things I've experienced.

<p>
	99.99999% of Christians have no clue what God is. This cannot be resolved with discussion. You must realize that you are God.

<p>
	Haha, the whole point of society is to help people collectively avoid looking at their shadow.
</p>

<p>
	70%+ of marketing is about triggering your shadow. How is business gonna control and exploit shadow-free people? You exploit people by appealing to their weaknesses, fears, hatreds, greed, and depravity.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, the mainstream doesn't offer any root solutions to any problems. It's all band-aids and opiates.
</p>

<p>
	The job of society is to construct a reality -- and to distract people long enough so they never realize that reality does not actually exist.

<p>
	This is false. Why do you assume this a priori without empirical validation? Rather unscientific of you. Have you examined all of reality? Then why jump to that conclusion? What percent of reality have you seen or understood? <0.000000000000001%
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you are using science unscientifically, turning it into an ideology. That is a bastardization of science.
</p>

<p>
	What you're not understanding about science is that it only studies one dimension of reality, at one level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness, science is untrue.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, it is impossible to reach truth with science because the map is never the territory.
</p>

<p>
	Please stop believing in Sam Harris and his ilk. Their understanding of reality and consciousness is very crude and demonstrably wrong. They are not even close to understanding reality, consciousness, or science. It's just another ideology.
</p>

<p>
	Despite the title of his book, Sam Harris is not awake and he does not understand what awakening really is. He is a dogmatic rationalist. And his fanbase is a rationalist cult. It's just another religion.
</p>

<p>
	If you really care about science, you should start to study philosophy of science and epistemology. And contemplate the foundations of all knowledge. You are not conscious yet of what knowledge or science are.
</p>

<p>
	Just to trigger the Sam Harrisite in you, what if I told you that you can access deeper facets of reality with witchcraft than science?
</p>

<p>
	That happens to be true. Check out witchcraft <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	No, that's only true of exoteric versions of any religion.
</p>

<p>
	The esoteric core of every religion recognizes that God and world and self are all one. The problem is, most people just can't fathom it.
</p>

<p>
	Jesus was God. How more nondual can you get? The kindgom of heaven is within he said.
</p>

<p>
	Jewish Kabballah is nondual.
</p>

<p>
	Sufism is nondual.
</p>

<p>
	The separation only exists in the minds of the separated.
</p>

<p>
	If God is infinite, how can you be separate from him? Lol. Infinite means EVERYTHING, including you!

<p>
	The trouble with all religion, in general, is that it mixes truths derived from genuine mystical experience with a political system of control. It's a bit like mixing caviar with poo. That's what distinguishes religion from mysticism. Mysticism is pure spirituality, without hierarchy or a political agenda. Religion always has a political agenda and seeks to establish a ruling authority.
</p>

<p>
	Mohammad was a mystic, but ALSO, he was a political leader who sought to unify warring tribes within Arabia and spread knowledge of the existence of Allah. As a political leader, of course he had to do a lot of evil stuff, otherwise he and his tribe would have been killed. Unification isn't all rainbows and butterflies. Political unification requires war and bloodshed to force people to submit under one banner.
</p>

<p>
	Harems were standard practice in Arabia at that time.

What I wanted to hear was you saying that greater Jihad = Jihad, while lesser isn't Jihad?

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because even when engaging in the lower Jihad, as Sam Harris does, or the United States as a whole does, for example, it is still none other than fighting with oneself.
</p>

<p>
	If everything is nondual, and all human beings are you, then who are you fighting with? Who you judging? All enemies are just projections of the ego.
</p>

<p>
	The struggle is always with oneself, even if you trick yourself into thinking you are fighting some external enemy.
</p>

<p>
	"We have seen the enemy, and he is us."
</p>

<p>
	Self/other is one. God is always in a struggle with itself, that's all. The Lesser Jihad simply amounts to slapping yourself in the face, then getting upset, and slapping yourself back.
</p>

<p>
	There really is no difference between igornance and walking the spiritual path. It's just a question of directness, which is a question of karma.
</p>

<p>
	To find Allah, some people will have to blow themselves up. Because that is their karma. To find Allah, some people will have to waste 5 lifetimes debating, arguing, judging, doing violence, being politically active, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Some people only wake up after enormous self-inflicted suffering or stupidity. Some people need to hit rock bottom before they are willing to surrender to Allah. But in the end, Allah will win over that ego. There is no escaping the Truth. The only question is, how long will you stall out the clock?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	1) The baseline level of consciousness you were born with.
</p>

<p>
	2) The degree to which you've deconstructed your mind. How much you've contemplated epistemic and metaphysical issues.
</p>

<p>
	3) Your brain physiology.
</p>

<p>
	4) Your karma
</p>

<p>
	5) Your geunine degree of curiosity about reality.
</p>

<p>
	My theory is that all of these factors are more important than dose or substance.

<p>
	Just for some context, I spent a good 10 years working on my life before discovering psychedelics. I also spent about 3 years doing meditation and self-inquiry every day before touching a psychedelic. And there was much growth from that.
</p>

<p>
	Then I discovered psychedelics and experienced ungodly levels of growth over about a year or two. The psychedelics were the gasoline on the fire. But I spent a lot of time stoking the fire, and that was well worth it.
</p>

<p>
	So don't feel bad if you can't do or don't want to do psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, psychedelics will totally change your life if you do them properly.
</p>

<p>
	So really, try to see it as a glass-half-full situation. We discovered an incredible tool for which we should be very grateful. Grateful that we are alive in the 21st century where these chemicals are widely available at all for the first time in 1000s of years. This shouldn't depress you. This should make you super motivated.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Yoga is a close second in power. You can achieve amazing things through yoga alone and other "natural" techniques like holotrophic breathing, etc. There is no shortage of techniques out there, so find what suits your style and budget.

You should be able to safely dose higher.
</p>

<p>
	For me 20mg is an epic mindfuck beyond the likes of which most people have ever experienced.
</p>

<p>
	25mg is unspeakably profound.
</p>

<p>
	And 30mg is...

<p>
	Hehe...
</p>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	I meant YOU can die and your body will keep on living. That's enlightenment! Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	Just what did you think "no-self" meant?
</p>

<p>
	It means there is no you inside that body. The feeling you have of you being inside that body is an illusion. And it must die.
</p>

<p>
	There is only one problem with your entire worldview, and that is: you think life's happening to you. Remove the "you" and problem is solved. It's just that simple really. Everything stays the same, but you cease to exist.

<p>
	Man... the lengths your guys' ego-minds go to deny God is quite amusing.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you call science is a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	Ain't no such thing as chemicals or brains, only hallucinated stories of such.
</p>

<p>
	I perfectly understand you're skeptical. But it just so happens to be a delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Take a few tabs of LSD and you'll quickly see this is so. Nevermind 5-MeO. Learn to walk before you fly.

<p>
	Then the field of psychedelics is just not for you.
</p>

<p>
	You've barely scratched the surface of what these substances can do.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, LSD only lasts about 5 hours. Beyond 6 hours it's just mild lingering after-effects.
