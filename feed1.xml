</p>

<p>
	The books will blow your mind and change your life and you will never look back.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be so paralyzed by avoiding bias that you are unable to take a decisive step.
</p>

<p>
	Risking $35 is like the lowest risk in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Reading books is not an epistemological submission to anything. I've read many books which were flat out false. And many of the books in my booklis are flat out false on many metaphysical issues. But that doesn't matter. It's all part of the process.
</p>

<p>
	You can read a book on witchcraft, disagree with it, and still come out wiser and better for having read it.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to verify a book's truth before reading it. That's backwards. First you read it, then you can assess how true you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot find truth unless you're willing to explore dead ends. Because you can't know ahead of time what is and what isn't a dead end. So a serious truth-seeker must have a high tolerance for risk. You gotta try stuff and fail more and faster than everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Read 200 books, and if they all turn out to be false, great! Now you know which books to avoid as you move on to read the next 200. << That's how you master life. Not through perfectionism and fear of making a mistake. I've read so many bullshit books in retrospect. They were all part of my journey to truth.

<p>
	It's possible in theory, if the dose is overly high.
</p>

<p>
	But a 1g dose of mushrooms or 125ug of LSD is not going to give anyone a psychotic break unless maybe they were already psychotic to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	You have understand that the few people who have psychotic breaks and so forth are already damaged to begin with. The psychedelic isn't what causes it. A lot of damaged people do psychedelics because there's such a huge stigma around it that "normies" are too chicken to try it. A normal person is not going to ever have a psychotic break from 1 or 2 grams of mushrooms. You have higher odds of having a serious reaction to Aspirin or penicillin.
</p>

<p>
	The doctor gave me penicillin last year and I had a horrible allergic reaction to it. Yet penicillin is prescribed every day without anyone even thinking twice about it.

		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	I agree with that. That is a great shame.
</p>

<p>
	But that's easily avoided with low doses.

<p>
	Why would a psychedelic do damage? What does "damage" even mean here?

<p>
	DMT is not gonna "damage" you at moderate doses.

<p>
	It will fuck with your mind, but that's not damage.

<p>
	I don't know if that's necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe some day. But 5-Meo-DMT is far superior to that for our work of Awakening. 30g of mushrooms will throw you into a twisted nest of crazy dream-like consciousness and you'll hardly remember a thing when you return. Mushrooms are very chaotic and twisted. Not good for reaching clarity.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Like I said, the mind cannot fathom Awakening so it tries to fit it into some category it knows, like solipsism.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not solipsism, but it's also true that you/God is the only thing that exists. So to you that sounds like solipsism and you can't tell the difference.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			I can understand that from absolute truth everything is one and therefore god as pure solipsim. But in the relative world where every person is in dual world, how is there solipsim?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To create that distinction between the absolute and the relative is already a mistake. The relative isn't real. Only the absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, if you want to qualify as "relative", then we can say that you are not alone. But this is precisely the illusion which we're trying to transcend.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like if you said, "Yeah, I understand that Santa Claus isn't real in the absolute sense. But in the relative world he's real." Okay, but what we're interested in is the absolute sense here, not the relative world of illusions. As an illusion, sure, everyone you know seems "real".
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Of course I imagine everyone but when I talk to someone which I imagine, <u>this person is also imagining me as a person</u>. Am I correct?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, you're not correct.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine that there is a person who imagines you. But actually there is only you imagining others imagining you.
</p>

<p>
	When you talk to someone you imagine, you are imagining that person's body too, not just their mind.
</p>

<p>
	To put frame it another way, your imagination is so powerful it IS reality! Right now you're still under the dualistic illusion that there is a difference between imagination and reality. As if imagination is somehow inferior or bad. But the difference between reality and imagination is itself something you imagine! This is what allows you/God to create reality out of thin air. Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	Where did all the people you know come from? They were NOT born from biological parents. They were imagined by your mind! If you stop imagining them, they will cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	What makes Awakening very different than classical solipsism is the God part. Classical solipsism has no recognition of self as God. Once you reach God-consciousness, the solipsism stuff becomes pretty irrelevant because you are so amazed at yourself as God.
</p>

<p>
	The true Awakening is yet ahead after you integrate and move past all the above.
</p>

<p>
	Take time to integrate all that, but don't stop there.
</p>

<p>
	Killer first trip. A lot for one trip. Too much really. Gotta baby step it not to freak yourself out. You rejected the enlightenment simply because you were too overwhelmed by it without enough gradual tripping and integration work. You needed a return to the safety of your old life. You'll come around. It takes a lot trips to iron out all the resistances, shadow material, and kinks before you can access full God-consciousness. It cannot be done in one or even 10 trips.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's not something I've had success with yet. But also not much practice.
</p>

<p>
	My healing has been derailed by ever deeper awakenings which make healing oneself seem like a moot point.
</p>

<p>
	Healing is a lower power than Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	When you are fully conscious that you are God, nothing needs healing. There is no difference between being healthy or sick at that level of consciousness. The desire to heal is in some sense egotistical. It assumes that something is less than Perfect, which is a delusion.
</p>

<p>
	At the same time, I do want to heal. It's practically necessary to keep doing my work. Life sucks when you got a chronic illness.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, he says some of the same stuff. But it's a question degree and depth. He's certainly much more awake than most humans. But then there are levels which I don't believe even he has ever accessed given his limited neurochemistry.
</p>

<p>
	For example, he talks about past lives, opening chakras, his wife leaving her body, etc. This is all imaginary from my level of realization. I don't get the sense that he is conscious that such things are part of his imagination.

	Perspectives are one thing.

<p>
	But then there is the present moment which is what's Absolute Truth.

		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I realized for the first time that God is real, at which point my heart filled with energy that seemed to explode and shoot out my fingertips like Force lighting, and it terrified the hell out of me. I was filled with God's Absolute Love. I realized that Love is not just a human emotion but something much more fundamental and metaphysical.
</p>

<p>
	It took many more awakenings to get a fuller understanding of what God and Love actually are. That was merely by first introduction to those notions. It was so radical and otherworldly that my mind had no frame of reference to understand it. It took me about a year to integrate that one breakthrough.

	Yes, it's fucking insane. I have had moments of awakening so profound I literally had to go on the toilet and shit because I could not hold myself together.

		<p>
			A model that I heard, and I can wrap my mind around is that you're not moving through time, but shifting through many static images per second, thereby creating a sense or illusion of continuity. Okay the whole reality, the whole shebang is here right now, just shifting through frames, okay fine, not something new here for me. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that's somewhat the right idea. In fact, imagine there is only ever 1 frame in existence.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that reality is 1 fluid frame. That's it. The end. This one fluid frame can change its shape without ever creating a second frame.

			<br />
			"Your parents start and end right now!", if you mean here their appearance (or appearances as they only exist as static pictures) in/as 'my' experience, yes alright.<br />
			<br />
			"You are imagining right now for the first time that you've imagined the past in the past many times before, thereby creating "memory"." You say that you imagine for the first time that there was a past. What are you trying to say here, how is a first time possible if there is no time? Maybe you just mean that the whole shebang is here right now, and so an experience of thought -that gets labeled memory- isn't referring to something that happened before. That memory experience is only a snapshot/experience and doesn't exist before or after the snapshot/experience "to which the memory refers". Is that what you mean?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that's sorta what I mean. If there is no time, that means everything is Eternal. It has existed forever. So this one fluid frame exists eternally, with no beginning or end. The beginnings and ends of the frame -- questions like where did it come from? What caused it to be this way? etc. -- are imagined. So if you ask, "Where did the current frame come from?" the mind will invent some causal explanation like, "Well, at one point I came out of my Mom's vagina and then I started using my eyes to see the world." << This is imagined and invented in the present to create an illusion of reality.
</p>

<p>
	It's just like how Hollywood invents backstory for its characters. The audience might wonder, "But where did Batman come from?" at which point some writer in Hollywood will just imagine a backstory to make Batman seen more real, like "Batman was born to some rich parents in Gotham city 40 years ago." And the audience is gullible enough to just buy it without ever realizing it's just pure fiction. Batman didn't come from rich parents. Batman was invented by some Hollywood business people to make them money! That's where Batman really came from.
</p>

<p>
	Could you imagine if you were watching a Batman movie and someone asked Batman about his origins and Batman replied, "Well, you see, the CEO of Warner Brothers wanted to buy a new yacht so he could bang his mistress without his wife finding out about it, so he greenlit this shitty movie. So here I am." You'd shit your pants. That's not what you wanted to here. It's too true! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<p>
	Gradually, gradually, see how high you can go without whiting out. White out is no good. You should have some decent headroom before white out.
</p>

<p>
	For me, 30mg is getting to max territory. 15mg is a normal breakthrough. 25mg is a heavy as fuck breakthrough. Plugging.

			Then what is that which is changing? For example, let's say that i cut my finger and now i have a wound. My body is different from a moment ago (which is memory --> imagination). I get it. But what is this which still can change? Can you explain this? There are things that i have in the present which i didn't have in the past. My body ages in time. Time doesn't exist. Only the present. But there is still change happening and then physical death some day. So do i also imagine aging (for example), "material" changes?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's easy. What's changing is Consciousness. Consciousness is that which imagines the present into its current shape.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is like a gaseous cloud that has infinite shape-shifting ability. This shape-shifting "cloud" is the very substance of everything. Yet it has no inherent substance of its own. It is literally pure imagination made manifest as brick walls, cars, trees, bodies, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a cloud in the sky which can change its shape to become a brick wall, a car, a tree, a body, a memory of your parents, etc. That's what the room you're current sitting in is. It's just hard for you to notice it because the room feels very concrete and rock solid. The cloud is like frozen for you right now. So you can't see it's cloud-like fluid nature. Because it is a fluid acting as a solid. The solidity is just an act which can easily be dissolved with psychedelics or some other practices.

<p>
	Since there is always only the present moment, in this moment you can either be in a state of God consciousness or not. If you are in a state of God consciousness, that's it. It doesn't matter how long it lasts. It could last 1 minute or a lifetime. The difference isn't important from the absolute POV -- since in fact all states are Absolute. But if you fall out of God consciousness back into a state of sleep and delusion, it will matter to you in the relative human sense in that you will have a memory of how good God consciousness feels and you will want to return to it but may not be able to, thus creating suffering.

<p>
	That's a tricky question to answer. Yes, there is, but then also there are even fuller ones.
</p>

<p>
	I assume at some point one becomes so conscious Earthly material reality would just disappear forever (AKA physical death). I can only speak to God realization while still remaining within Earthly reality because that's where I wish to remain for now and I could not communicate with you otherwise.

<p>
	That's also a tricky question to answer. I don't have a full solution to that yet. Still working on it.
</p>

<p>
	But the assumption that psyches don't create permanent changes is false. Maybe you can't fully live from that peak, but they still create changes in you which will last for a lifetime. It's just a question of how much change are you looking for? If you want to be in peak God consciousness 24/7, I'm not sure yet if that's possible. Seems doubtful. Enlightened masters are not always peaking.
</p>

<p>
	But you should be able to inch closer and closer.

	It's far more radical than that. Since all difference is absolutely relative, there is no difference whatsoever between start and end, therefore it never started. You are imagining right now that it started at some point, and thereby you create the illusion of it having started. This illusion of a start is indistinguishable from reality, so it seems as though it started. But it never did. Everything always starts and ends right now! Your parents start and end right now! They were never real! They didn't give birth to you. You are concocting that story on the fly RIGHT NOW for the first time! This is its start and its end.
</p>

<p>
	It's absolutely crucial to become conscious that there is no difference between start and end within consciousness. Oneness cannot have a beginning or an end.
</p>

<p>
	There was never just void. That void is something you imagine existed in the past to explain the present. But past is something you're imagining right now for the very first time! Even the idea that you've imagined the past before is wrong, because that assumes a past! You've never imagined the past before. You are imagining right now for the first time that you've imagined the past in the past many times before, thereby creating "memory". Memory is nothing but imagination in the present. Everything you think you remember is actually you imagining for the first time in the present without realizing that you're doing so. Ta-da!

	There is nothing whatsoever outside your present moment. You are just still in denial about that. If you look very precisely and carefully you will notice that all other people have been your imagination 100% of the time. Even to deny what I'm saying you must imagine a Leo!

<p>
	Yes and no.
</p>

<p>
	You are God and Love right now, and always, but you are not remotely conscious of that. It's the consciousness of it that matters. If you aren't conscious of it, you aren't Awake and it is not true for you.
</p>

<p>
	An idea that you are God & Love is not the same as awareness of yourself as God and Love. Just as an idea of being a millionaire is not the same as sleeping on a pile of cash.
</p>

<p>
	This requires a change in your state. All states are God, but not all states are aware that they are God. That's the key difference. You need to be in a state where you are aware of it, not merely thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
	It's more than just a realization or an insight, it is a live change in one's state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	When it is your live state, the issue of letting go of it becomes inapplicable. You are it. Or you are not.
</p>

<p>
	Holding it intellectually can become a problem, yes. If that's what you mean.

<p>
	When you realize that death = Love, that will be it.
</p>

<p>
	To realize this you must actually experience death. (Without physically harming the body.) Don't worry, it's impossible to miss it. But you can fool yourself into thinking you've gone all the way.

<p>
	The notion of "permanence" requires deconstruction because it is dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	What is the difference between permanent and temporary if all is one?
</p>

<p>
	At the moment of full God-realization, there is no such difference. But of course you're not likely to stay in that God-consciousness for long. You will fall out of it over and over again. But even so, at least you'll have a memory of what Absolute Love is. Which is a great thing to have. It can serve as your compass in life.

<p>
	Even someone with a heart awakening still has only a tiny sense of what Love truly means.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be an understanding of Love without full God realization. Because God is Love. But you do not understand what God is, so you do not really understand what Love is.
</p>

<p>
	The only one who can understand what Love is, is God. So you must become God. Which simply means you must Awaken. Really, really, deeply Awaken. Profoundly Awaken. You must Awaken deeper than the Buddha. And how do you do that?

Your videos are literally the worst possible thing for my mental health. I am done with your repulsive content.  I'll never know how you could ever sleep at night, let alone function. What you're constantly saying is true is narcissistic insanity. If I honestly stated exactly how I felt about you, I would likely be kicked off this website instantly. Not that it really even matters at this point since I'll probably never feel any desire to return to it.

	This is highly advanced work for serious people.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't stomach it, find some newbie self-help teachings.
</p>

<p>
	This works assumes you are mentally stable and grounded. My teachings are not suitable for people struggling to make it through their day.
</p>

<p>
	And watch your disrespectful and accusatory tone.
</p>

<p>
	If the idea of solipsism triggers you, you got a lot of work to do.

<p>
	The person in the above video is not awake and his explaining is incorrect.

<p>
	There are no others. Period. It's only you imagining stuff.

			From my understanding, although this stuff is difficult to get your head around....we are not God. We have a body...we have a soul (the YOU)... and we can have a regenerated spirit (The i am).

<p>
	But many health issues have to do with lack of consciousness, lying, self-hatred, fear, emotional blockages, false worldviews, overthinking, stress, emotional abuse, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Anything which can help elevate consciousness can help with healing too.
</p>

<p>
	Many people have healed themselves with psychedelics. To ignore or deny the healing properties of psychedelics is to rob many people of a life-saving tool.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening and healing go hand in hand because most health issues result from corrupt consciousness.

	The debates were pretty good this election cycle. There were so many of them that lots of issues got covered and things were pretty clearly laid out. There's no confusing who stands for what unless you didn't watch them.
</p>

<p>
	A debate with 10 people cannot ever be deep. The format has its limits and must work within that. No one is going to watch a 5 hour debate about technical policy details.
</p>

<p>
	Stop expecting some sort of perfection from democracy. It's a system. It is what it is. It's working okay. Constantly bashing it isn't a solution.

<p>
	Nah, too much 3 dimensional chess. A Trump win should be avoided as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Biden is not as bad as progressives make him out to be. He would still move the country forward.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, much of the stuff Bernie wants to pass would never pass the Congress anyway.
</p>

<p>
	Will Biden dismantle the whole capitalism neoliberal system? Hell no, but that's not gonna happen even under Bernie. That system is way too entrenched and people are not ready to give it up.
</p>

<p>
	We gotta take small wins.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump gets a 2nd term he will appoint 2 far right Supreme Court justices which will be a horrible blow for generations to come. That alone makes Biden worthwhile. Trump can do things in the 2nd term which will take generations to undo. So it's a poor move to try to help progressives by not voting for Biden. You will live to regret that. If Biden beats Bernie, accept it and vote for Biden vs Trump with the same enthusiasm you would have had for Bernie vs Trump. Never take for granted how much worse things could be than Biden.

			If I had to posit a guess, it would be because cubism, expressionism etc. was a reaction of the stuffy formalism of the stage Blue society it came form, and was used to express things like individualism, self-identity, one's own passion, the absurdity of excessive formalism such that was found in classical art, and so on. It's not really Green because it's not expressing feelings of love, humanity, ecology, etc and its not Turquoise because it wasn't really about mystical insights and oneness, although it may have had some Green elements to it.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a good explanation.
</p>

<p>
	If you studied art history you know most of Western art since Christ was about religious propaganda and displays of civilizational power. Portraits of kings, etc. That was stage Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Then came Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Picasso, Abstract Expressionism, Andy Warhol, etc. which threw that stage Blue paradigm in the trash in favor of individualistic artistic expression, materialism, breaking conventions, etc. Stage Green didn't really exist back then.

<p>
	You can start with any of those basic practices.
</p>

<p>
	I said 5-MeO-DMT if you really want to awaken now. But you have a long way to go before that.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't reduce my teachings down to such simple-minded black vs white drivel. I gave you lots of nuance which you don't want to hear.

<p>
	That's why you're the student and not the teacher.
</p>

<p>
	This work is very nuanced and tricky. It's best to stay humble until you get your legs before you go criticizing. Criticizism doesn't bother me. The problem is your criticism comes from a deep lack of experience and expertise, so it's largely a waste of time. Nothing personal. But you are just using all this criticism to avoid doing the actual work within yourself.

<p>
	Absolutely not.
</p>

<p>
	Only you baby. There's nothing in the universe but you.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't confuse God from some image or idea. Images and ideas will always come short of God itself.
</p>

<p>
	If you ever encounter something you think is other than God, expand your notion of God until it includes that thing. Ad infinitium. That is the true God.

Do you think they had 5meo dmt when that advice was given? your straw manning me. I didn’t say you should pursue enlightenment without seriousness, just that you should take precautions and maybe slow down. You said each awakening is deeper than the last and that there is no bottom right? So what’s the point of trying to get to the bottom? I feel like you could ease the pedal and stop compressing your development. You could develop other aspects of yourself like your physical body with ashtanga yoga since ultimately everything is being transmitted through your body. Make the antenna more durable. Slow down the pace of the psychedelic use and integrate over a period of 10 years rather than 2. Ultimately you are still in a limited human form, perhaps you should embrace it.

<p>
	Worry about your own development and let me work on mine.
</p>

<p>
	You are speaking of things you don't understand and trying to give me advice. This is not a good use of your time. It's like a junior high student trying to tell a college profressor how to do his research.

<title>Does Spiral Dynamics debunk historical materialism?</title>

<p>
	The material IS the spiritual, just in unrecognized form.
</p>

<p>
	SD and historical materialism both point at the same thing: most people need to meet their basic needs before they can evolve higher. Material needs like food, clean water, shelter, schools, police, healthcare, decent neighborhoods, decent courts, roads, and other infrastructure is crucial for further evolution.
</p>

<p>
	The sooner you satisfy the material, the sooner you can transcend it to the spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	It makes no sense to ask someone to meditate when he is being chased by the mafia or his children have no school to go to.
</p>

<p>
	Historical materialism is correct, but it fails to properly account for the highest levels of evolution which occur once the material needs are all met. Historical materialism reaches stage Green and cannot see above that to Tier 2. That's why SD is more powerful. It accounts for higher levels.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not reached by dabblers. You underestimate how serious this work is.
</p>

<p>
	Serious spirituality is not without risks. You have to want it more than you want to live. Which explains why it is rare.

</p>

<p>
	Keep going deeper. You've only just begun. Don't increase your dose. Just do more trips and contemplate the shit out of each one until clarity is reached. Each trip will thus take you deeper and deeper. Until one day you reach total realization of yourself as God: creator of the Universe.

<p>
	Many of my trips are so good that's what maked them so challenging.
</p>

<p>
	You'll understamd once you have a breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, all fear is an illusion. Once you realize that, that makes tripping easier.
</p>

<p>
	The fear is just those aspects of the ego-self which require purification, until one day you transcend all fear and enter Paradise.
</p>

<p>
	Total awakening is the complete absence of fear because you are so conscious that you see all things as yourself, and God cannot fear itself. It makes no sense to fear Love.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is what keeps you locked in ego, seperated from God's Love.

<p>
	When you realize you are God, you also realize everyone is God, but you also realize that they have no clue that they are God and your heart breaks at the thought of how to communicate it to them such that they could realize it.
</p>

<p>
	The tragedy of God is that it's so good it is denied by almost all precisely because it sounds too good to be true. Yet it is nothing but Absolute Truth. How could Absolute Truth be denied? The mind finds a million ways.

			Gotta disagree here. Poll after poll has shown, that when people are asked about which issues they support, they overwhelmingly come out in favor of the so-called ´progressive´ agenda: Universal health care, gun control, no endless wars, legalizing marijuana, etc.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But that's not how people vote. People do not vote on policy, they vote using their gut which follows their level of development. People vote based on the candidates personality and vibe more than policy.
</p>

<p>
	On paper, yes, people like many progressive policies, but they are also scared of change and they vote like sheep in a herd. They do not carefully evaluate things and they are not willing to make the sacrifices necessary to make Green happen.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to say you want Med4All in a poll. It's a lot harder when you realize your taxes might go up, and you might have to sacrifice your current doctor to make it happen, and you might have to vote against your own family, friends, and church group.

	It's like if you polled people in Iraq whether they want to live in a rich democractic country. They would all say yes. But when you tell them they have to surrender fundamentalist Islam and clan warfare and petty corruption, they will not be able to do it because they haven't developed that high yet. Good stuff comes at a cost. It isn't free. If you want to live in a democracy there are certain sacrifices that must be made, like tolerating your neighbhor who has a different religion than you. Or not killing gays for being gay. You'd think such sacrifices are not a big deal, but they are a big deal to many traditional people. People are scared of change. People are scared of selflessness. Most people treats politics and life as an arms race, looking to gain the most advantage for themselves rather than doing what is best for the collective. People's fear , hate, and selfishness overpowers their love, hope, and selflessness. It's easy to say you want love, but will you actually follow through when your survival is threatened? Will you lay down your fear and judgment? Most won't. People want love but aren't willing to pay the cost to get it.

	Good luck convincing a mother of 3 who works in accounting for the health insurance industry to support Med4All when it means that she will likely lose her job and her kids will not get the toys they want for Xmas.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just evil corporations at work here. The "evil corporations" are supported by many middle class folks because it pays their bills. "The establishment" is made out of ordinary citizens, not some special race of evil reptile people.
</p>

<p>
	How do you convince ordinary citizens to sacrifice for the greater good? << That is the root problem here.
</p>

<p>
	And also, how do you get them to stop thinking and acting like herd animals? In a herd, even if one sheep develops a mind of its own, very soon it will be peer pressured by the herd to fall back in line. The herd feels comfy with Biden. Policies be damned.

	Well, he's clearly in a battle with himself, which explains his autoimmune issues. His psyche is fragmented by his judgment and demonization and bitterness. A toxic combo. Not good for one's health to be that way.

<title>Biden has come back</title>

<p>
	It's not rigged against Bernie, the majority of the country is simply not educated or developed enough to vote for Green.
</p>

<p>
	In a democracy, not the best candidates wins, but the one who best matches the development level of the people. That what we're seeing. That's also why Trump won.
</p>

<p>
	The simple fact is, Americans are pretty damn ignorant, so you shouldn't expect them to all of the sudden elect amazing people. That has never been the case.
</p>

<p>
	What Bernie supporters and progrrssives need to understand is that they are in a bubble. The majority of the Americans are not progressive, they are moderate. "The establishment" is not just the corporations, media, and Washington, it is most of the citizens as well. The media is establishment precisely because that's what most people pay to watch, not because the media is somehow overriding the will of the people. The will of the people is just not very bright and the media reflects that. The establishment IS the people. That's what progessives are in denial about.
</p>

<p>
	I see a lot of progressives in denial about thier own biases, projecting their progressive bias on the media and estblaishment. When a progressive calls the media biased, the truth is, the progressive is biased but cannot see it, so the only option is to blame the media.
</p>

<p>
	Joe Biden didn't win because of a rigged media. He won because that's where most people are at. And that's a very difficult thing for progressives to admit. Progressives need to admit that most people are not progrssives. This is a more realistic starting point rather than assuming that a majority of people are progressives but some evil "establishment" is holding them back. That gets into fantastical conspiracy theory territory which fails to properly identify the problem and take responsibility for it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really see Bernie winning it now. Most of the country is still not developed enough to see Bernie's appeal, hence Biden is what a majority can agree on.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that most of the US is not a solid stage Green. So it's really hard for solid Green to get elected.
</p>

<p>
	Before someone like Bernie can win, voters have to grow up (or die). Most would rather die than grow up. So here we are.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to be able to extract 5-MeO-DMT from grass. N,N-DMT maybe, if you're a good chemist with equipment.
</p>

<p>
	Not worth it. Much easier to get synthetic.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You can use a volcano like device or even create your own vape pen carts. Just avoid toxic oils that will ruin your lungs. Use pure turpenes inside of oil.
</p>

<p>
	Both methods work excellently and can be used with basically any powedered psychedelics, including 5-MeO-DMT. You can made a 5-MeO-DMT vape pen. But watch out, even one puff is very intense. Plugging is still superior for 5-MeO-DMT. If N,N-DMT plugged, I would plug it.

<p>
	Solipsism is not awakening. The mistake is thinking that what I'm talking about is solipism when I never made such a claim.
</p>

<p>
	The mind desperately wants some way to understand awakening so it grabs at every philosophical system is can: solipsism, nihilism, panpsychism, Buddhism, etc. And all of that is not awakening.

<p>
	The notion that you have a brain is itself the maze of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	To escape the maze is to realize it never existed other than in your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	When you think, "This is caused by the brain", that's you trapping yourself in the maze. The maze of materialism.

	That's exactly what's happening. But evolution takes time. We are smack dab in the middle of it.
</p>

<p>
	People take evolution for granted, thinking it's something that happened a million years ago. No. It's happening right now, via you.

			firstly, only something ‘other than god’ would need to proclaim itself as being god. Why would god need to say ‘I’m god’,.. I mean... should I write it in my resume now that I’m enlightened? Do I get a free parking spot at selected restaurants that says ‘reserved for god’?
		</p>

		<p>
			Secondly, If you’re proclaiming that you are god, you can only say that to god. I mean think about it, why would you need to say ‘I am god’ and by the way, I won’t even say that you’re speaking to yourself, because that’s another trap the ego likes to hide in, but it just simply implies that you consider the person you’re proclaiming it to something other than god. Such energy can only perpetuate arrogance and entitlement, which are sticking points of ego, not enlightenment.
		</p>

		<p>
			tldr: saying ‘I am god’ is the most unenlightened thing you can ever say

	</div>

<p>
	You are speaking nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	You haven't realized what it means to be God. You are playing games.
</p>

<p>
	When you finally realize you are God, you will shout it from the top of your lungs. And all of your logic will fly out the window.
</p>

<p>
	You need to say "I am God" precisely because you're not conscious that you are. False humility is not a virtue here.

	Vaped some moderate doses of N,N-DMT. To me it feels very similar to a low dose of 5-MeO-DMT. Very similar headspace, but 5-MeO-DMT is a lot more potent. 5x to 10x more potent.

	Yup, it's brutal. Which is why alcohol exists.
</p>

<p>
	Without alcohol, the Earth's population would be 75% less.
</p>

<p>
	When doing approaches it's crucial to build up momentum. The first 5 approaches of the night are just a warm up. After the first 5, everything becomes much easier. After 15 approaches in one night, each next approach becomes effortless. Then the next night you gotta start all over again from zero.
