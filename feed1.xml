That is her telling you: "Come fuck me please."
</p>

<p>
	If you do those kind of approaches you will see the girl is super-receptive and your job of picking her up becomes almost effortless.
</p>

<p>
	So don't ever pass those up.
</p>

<p>
	Stop blinking like a fool, grow some balls and approach.

<p>
	No it isn't.
</p>

<p>
	There is a concept of absolute truth, and then there is actual Absolute Truth. Which is why we capitalize it.
</p>

<p>
	But of course your mind will just play the trick of making another concept of Absolute Truth. Those are the games you play.

<p>
	You have not come even close to stripping yourself of your conceptualizations and contexts.

<p>

<p>
	That's very challenging.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, you just gotta push yourself into sets and force yourself to keep them going as long as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Try to make your goal to open a set of girls and talk to them for 60 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Keep your talk emotional and illogical. Telling stories is good. Talking about yourself is good.
</p>

<p>
	Most extroverts are masters of talking about nothing and talking about themselves.
</p>

<p>
	You'd be amazed how far you can get your foot in the door just talking about yourself like a pure narcissist.
</p>

<p>
	There are many pros and cons to each.
</p>

<p>
	Day pros:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Virtually zero competition
	</li>
	<li>
		Less noise and obstacles, no friends to cock-block. It's easier to have a conversation.
	</li>
	<li>
		Can run into girls who are introverted and/or don't like to drink or party. Higher quality girls overall.
	</li>
	<li>
		Good even if you're alone (without friends or wings)
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Day cons:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Much smaller volume of girls, your approach needs to be well-honed. Waste a lot of time just standing around. Not efficient. Not so good for building up skills.
	</li>
	<li>
		Girls often have boyfriends
	</li>
	<li>
		You're basically only grabbing phone numbers
	</li>
	<li>
		Can't physically escalate much, your game needs to be much more chill and toned down.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Night pros:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Lots more targets. Far more efficient use of your time.
	</li>
	<li>
		Girls are looser and down to fuck
	</li>
	<li>
		Much more likely to be single, less boyfriend rejections.
	</li>
	<li>
		Much better for training and practicing your skills
	</li>
	<li>
		Can get away with sloppy approaches and social awkwardness better
	</li>
	<li>
		Can do rapid and heavy physical escalation
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Night cons:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Lots of competition
	</li>
	<li>
		Lots of noise and distractions, hard to hear, hard to talk.
	</li>
	<li>
		Messes with your sleep schedule
	</li>
	<li>
		Need to go for one-night stands, forced to close same-night
	</li>
	<li>
		Drunk girls
	</li>
	<li>
		Friends cockblocking
	</li>
	<li>
		Dancing
	</li>
	<li>
		The club can be very intimidating if you're alone. Wings are more important.
	</li>
	<li>
		Lots of dealing with annoying logistics challenges
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Over all, day game is awesome. The two serious problem with it are:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Far too few hot girls walking around during the day.
	</li>
	<li>
		The best ones are rarely single
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Day game is really only viable in certain locations with high volumes of people and hot girls. Such locations tend to be hard to find. Or you can do day game very sporadically as you do your grocery shopping, etc. But this is far too infrequent to be relied upon. It's more of a bonus you get as a veteran of the game. Once you have built up your skills you should be able to execute a solid approach on any random hot girl you see anywhere during the day.
</p>

			I am a manger at a Walgreens. If I took the bag of chips away from a shoplifter and they got outraged <strong><em>I'd</em></strong> be the one that would get fried. Cooperates fear of bad PR/liability is that bad. If they got outraged and happened to be black and "a social media influencer" and then they would fire half the store where it happened and every single manger in the company would have to attend racial sensitivity training.....<em>again</em>. Company policy is <s>bend over and take it </s>always provide extraordinary customer care no matter what, There is no situation were a manager can take the bag away from a shoplifter with out <em><strong>the manager </strong></em>risking serious terminatable trouble in the current environment.

<p>
	You are talking about a completely different issue, one of PR and legal liability.
</p>

<p>
	I was talking about the entitlement of someone acting outraged when something they didn't pay for gets taken away from them.
</p>

<p>
	What your corporate overlords want you  to do is irrelevant. A bank is not gonna let you walk away with a $500k house.

<p>
	Yup
</p>

<p>
	Solid Orange people tend to be more modest about their wealth. Like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet. They have it, but their ego is not so insecure as to need to flaunt it in everyone's face.
</p>

<p>
	Tacky displays of obscene wealth and luxury are a hallmark of a Red psyche.

<p>
	It's simple. China wants to eliminate religion, spirituality, and Islam. Leadership is materialist & atheist there, as in Soviet Russia.
</p>

<p>
	What they're doing is analogous to what Hitler was doing.

</p>

<p>
	When you saying, "I am racist" or "He is racist" most people intuitively take that to mean: he holds personal racists views, like a KKK member. Which is not at all what systemic racism is.
</p>

<p>
	It would be a lot clearer instead to say: "I am part of a systemically racist system which I'm not doing much to reform."
</p>

<p>
	Systemic racism as a concept needs to be spelled out much better to people because most people are not advanced enough to know what systems thinking is. So when they hear "systemic racism" they simply don't understand it.
</p>

<p>
	I was talking to my family doctor the other week and despite being an educated MD, he did not understand what systemic racism is. He confused it with personal racism and denied it on those grounds. His reasoning was like this: "Well, I'm Indian with brown skin and no one has been personally racist to me in America. All my colleagues are nice to me. Therefore systemic racism is not real."
</p>

	It should not matter as long as you eat enough calories for gaining weight.
</p>

<p>
	1 meal per day is not healthy or reasonable.
</p>

<p>
	You can also eat carbs which are not going to drain your energy, like veggies and fruits. What you want is to avoid heavy refined carbs.

	"The strong do what they can while the weak suffer what they must." -- Thucydides

			The Athenians offer the Melians an ultimatum: surrender and pay tribute to Athens, or be destroyed. The Athenians do not wish to waste time arguing over the morality of the situation, because in practice might makes right—or, in their own words, "the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must".
		</p>

		<p>
			The Melians argue that they are a neutral city and not an enemy, so Athens has no need to conquer them. The Athenians counter that if they accept Melos' neutrality and independence, they would look weak: Their subjects would think that they left Melos alone because they were not strong enough to conquer it.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Melians argue that an invasion will alarm the other neutral Greek states, who will become hostile to Athens for fear of being invaded themselves. The Athenians counter that the other Greek states on the mainland are unlikely to act this way, because they are free and independent and thus loath to take up arms against Athens. What worries Athens is potential rebellions in its empire from disgruntled peoples they have already conquered. Conquering Melos will demonstrate Athens' strength and discourage rebellions.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Melians argue that it would be shameful and cowardly of them to submit without a fight. The Athenians counter that it is only shameful to submit to an opponent whom one has a reasonable chance of defeating. There is no shame in submitting to an overwhelmingly superior opponent like Athens.

<p>
	Well, Cartman is a ridiculous extreme caricature.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, in his most extreme he's Red, but when he's being more like a normal human, he's Orange.

<p>
	South Park depicts a lot of exaggerated and outlandish scenarios for purposes of satire and comedy. It's not meant to be real life.

	Most people's method for awakening is like trying to catch fish with bare hands.
</p>

<p>
	Horribly ineffective. And then when you tell them to use a net or stick of dynamite they demonize you for it because they have been brainwashed that unless a fish is caught with bare hands it isn't a real fish.
</p>

<p>
	Human spiritual technology is still in the Dark Ages. Like trying to saw down a tree with your teeth because you saw a beaver do it that way.

<p>
	Yes, of course that's part of it, but it goes much deeper than that. You see, to maintain an "objective" duality between male/female (which isn't real) requires a rigid external system of enforcement. You have to deny that male/female is an imaginary line in the same way that you have to enforce a national boarder.
</p>

<p>
	Many men have homosexual urges which they must deny in order to maintain a tough guy macho appearance because their environment does not allow them the luxury of indulging their feminine side.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, when the majority of guys are straight, you are forced to fit in or get bullied or even killed.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck indulging your feminine side in prison.
</p>

<p>
	There is a difference between being a closeted masculine gay vs a flaming queen.
</p>

<p>
	And some cultures were more advanced than others. The Greeks had democracy, for a while, until they lost it. That does not make democracy widespread or automatic.

<p>
	Your framing is wrong. It's not random at all.
</p>

<p>
	It's like saying that catching fish is random. Only seems that way to unskilled fishermen.
</p>

<p>
	If you use a stick of dynamite you will catch fish every time. But if you insist on catching fish with your hands, then you will struggle and it will seem random.

			Sorry Leo, but this is such an old antiquated (80s) view of gay men. At least where I live, which a large portion of the population is gay, most gay men are strong, muscular, self-confident and capable. If any gay-bashing bro messed with them, they'd most definitely regret it. I'm sure other places can be different, but I stand by my statement that your views on gay men are honestly insulting.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hehehe....
</p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating the depth of the situation and what I said.
</p>

<p>
	Gayness has been a survival obstacle for men for thousands of years, which is why it is still so stigmatized around the world in nearly all cultures. The fact that some progressive pockets have advanced to a stage of society in the last 20 years where being gay is not a serious liability, that doesn't disprove my point, that proves my point.
</p>

<p>
	Today, in a highly advanced society you can be gay without much problem. But this was not true for most of humam history, and it still is not true in most parts of the world. Hence stage Red and Blue gay stigmas remain.
</p>

<p>
	None of this should be surprising to you. That you cannot see this shows how fucking pampered, entitled, and oblvious you are to the way most humans survive in the world.
</p>

<p>
	If you live in San Francisco, NYC, or LA and act gay, no problem. If you live in Russia or the Middle East and act gay, they might cut your dick off just for fun.
</p>

<p>
	Better yet, try acting gay in prison. See what happens to your survival odds.
</p>

<p>
	Being gay is a luxury only recently made available thanks to rising incomes and advancements in civilization. Which is why in countries like Iran the idea of being gay does not even exist. They think gays only live in America. Because to be gay in Iran is suicidal.
</p>

	There is nothing mysterious about it. All social norms are there for survival purposes.
</p>

<p>
	For mankind to get to where we are now there had to be strong pressure for masculine/feminine polarity. Blurring that line screwed with the family system.
</p>

<p>
	Nature forces men to compete with other men. Hard to do that when you are gay. Other men will see you as a pussy and dominate you.

<p>
	You have to understand that from my vantage point the right-wing worldview is so full of self-deception that I cannot take it seriously. It's too wrong to fix and it is a waste of my life energy to even listen to.

<p>
	But hey, your vantage point may differ. You do you.

<p>
	Just know that what you're listening to is utter self-deception.

Too much theory.
</p>

<p>
	The notion that you are doing this out of unconditional love is laughable. You are a selfish devil looking for low hanging fruit under the guise of "unconditional love".
</p>

<p>
	You can easily find girls who are not into kids or marriage. But they will still want some commitments from you. They are not gonna let you use them like your personal Fleshlight. They got survival needs too and you will hear them whining about it to you. So get used that.

	There is definitely a point to salvia.

<p>
	Nothing will show you how deep consciousness goes like salvia.

<p>

			Jesus, you've got an incredible talent to verbalize a complex experience in a few line!

		<p>
			To be fair, the paradox is that I find men attracted to this idealized concept of a female unattractive by default.
		</p>

		<p>
			Compelling women to play by those standards, normalizing and rationalizing it, is a selfish driven collective form of abuse at the opposite of genuine love and care. As you stated it, there is no possible win.  A man who's got that objectifying quality can only offer us ashes.
		</p>

		<p>
			The rules of that game put both gender in the loser bucket. What type of authentic relationship could we have in this context? 
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm totally fine with physical attraction, but the predatory aspect of flesh is a red flag. Humans are subject, not object.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is missing on the best part of the relationship and that's a pity. <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />

<p>
	All this is just the female form of game.
</p>

<p>
	When you decide to actually open your legs for a man, you will absolutely have screened him through your female survival agenda, otherwise you would never sleep with him.
</p>

<p>
	So your position is rank hypocrisy masquerading as love and compassion.
</p>

<p>
	You don't give a damn about low value men.
</p>

<p>
	It's extremely sneaky and convenient of you ladies to whine about how unfair it is that men objectify you. Yet you are attracted to high value males.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between a guy being attracted to big tits vs a girl being attracted to an alpha guy.
</p>

<p>
	Notice yourself playing these sneaky games.
</p>

<p>

	Zen is full of dogma and cosplay.
</p>

<p>
	I've met serious Zen students. They are such sheep. And not at all woke. Unimpressive.
</p>

<p>
	Zen teachers are also lacking.

			I understand on a theoretical level no one on here exists, but I still cannot fathom the idea that others are not also experiencing  consciousness - the concept that God only experiences one bubble at a time  I've had awakenings to oneness and love in the past, but maybe I will never know without 5-meo. It was clearly not a deep enough awakening anyhow.

<p>
	Perspective is a relative notion.
</p>

<p>
	It does not exist at the absolute level.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is not a 1st person perspective. That is the ego's illusion. Consciousness is Absolute Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	There is a further wrinkle here. Since imagination is reality, you could say that by imagining others you make them "real". In a relative sense. You literally create others in the way you create rocks and cars. So.... if you want to play life like others are real, you can. Nothing is really taken away from you. You can dive into and out of the illusion and enjoy it from both angles.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a video game. It doesn't have to be "real" to be fun. Enjoy the game as a game. Don't take it too seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Not all the time. The illusion of helping you is still powerful and sticky.
</p>

<p>
	But you have to consider that there's literally nothing better to do. Anything you do is equally pointless, so you might as well help people out and follow your passions. People will act nicer towards you and the world will be a nicer place to live.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, selfishness still causes suffering. So living your life selfishly will not feel so good for you even if you are the only one in the Universe. If you rape someone, you will still go to jail.

<p>
	From now on, every time I make a mistake or act selfishly, I'll just say: You guys don't get it, I'm actually being hyper strategic.
</p>

<p>
	Like when I slip on a banana peel I was just say, "It's all good guys. I meant to do that. It was all part of my master plan to awaken the world. You're just not woke enough to see it." <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	"Hey, Leo, why did you steal my money?"
</p>

<p>
	"Don't worry. It's all part of the master plan."

</p>

<p>
	The people who bought stock towards the second half of the upswing are all gonna lose money. And then they will justify it to themselves as: "Well, it was for a good cause. At least we fucked those Wall Street elite."
</p>

<p>
	GameStop and AMC are likely doomed companies that will crash and burn no matter how much you pump or hype them up. These stocks were in the dumps for good reason -- they don't have a bright future.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like you're taking a homeless man on the street and saying, "Let's give this poor guy a bunch of money!" And so you gather a thousand of your friends and pool together $10 million to give this homeless guy. And what does he do with it? He goes to Vegas and loses it all on the roulette table. Because he wasn't homeless by accident, he was homeless because he's utterly irresponsible and mentally challenged.

	You dream that I am awake so that you could awaken yourself.

<p>

<p>
	You want "others" to awaken as a distraction from waking up yourself, haha <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	If you really cared about awakening you would stop concerning yourself with the unwokeness of others. Can you see how good a distraction it is to complain about how others are not woke? This is a trap the ego creates for itself because it is to scared to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest mindfucks of awakening is that once you're fully awake you realize there is literally nobody else to help or save. There is no reason to be a teacher or guru. The teacher or guru role is itself a bullshit illusion.
</p>

<p>
	One of the biggest traps in this work is the fantasy that you will become this great teacher and savior of mankind. Well, that turns out to be an illusion the ego imagined in order to feel a sense of purpose and meaning. The reality is that you awaken and then that's it. There's nothing left to do. There is no one to save, nothing to fix.

<p>
	If you are clever, you can get access to frat parties by befriending a few hot girls and then telling the frat guys that if they invite you to their party, you will bring 3 hot girls and they will each bring 2 friends. The guys will love you and will want you at all of their parties. Build a contact list of 10 to 20 girls who you are not dating or fucking, but are "just friends" for purposes of party invites.

		</p>

		<p>
			In a way, my life is paranormal in the sense that it is pure magic, but the idea of time travel, Astral Projection, channeling, precognition, etc. is just imagination to me.  I can test it out any ideas in my imagination to see if they have truth or reality in relation to my Direct Experience.  But if an idea such as paranormal stuff like precognition is something that I can test, doesn't that mean that precognition is an Absolute that exists beyond my own current experience and understanding, or am I inventing precognition as I come to understand it? 
		</p>

		<p>
			The idea of paranormal seems to suggest to me that there is more to reality than I currently conceive or experience.  I get that the only thing I have of reality is Direct Experience and Imagination, but what do you make of paranormal phenomenon like precognition if my Direct Experience and Imagination tell me that it doesn't exist?  If I cannot verify paranormal phenomenon in my own Direct Experience or if I was to be too closed-minded to verify, does that mean paranormal or precognition does not exist since I am only imagining it? 
		</p>

<p>
	You're confusing things. What I said does not in any way preclude the paranormal. If you see a yogi levitating, that's all fine and good. It's still happening within your bubble of experience. Likewise with any other paranormal phenomenon such as astral travel, telepathy, auras, angels, DMT entities, aliens, channeling, spirit realms, hell realms, clairvoyance, UFOs, mothman whatever.
</p>

<p>
	You are right, there is no difference between the normal and the paranormal other than social convention and definition of terms.
</p>

<p>
	Look at it this way: your fridge is imaginary, but that does not prevent you from going in your kitchen, opening the fridge, and exploring its contents. Likewise with the paranormal.
</p>

<p>
	If you meet an alien, angel, or deity -- they will still be you talking to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You are correct that there is more to what consciousness can do, or what it can imagine, than just the conventional material world. Consciousness can imagine twisted hyperbolic geometry worlds full of aliens and angels and whatever else. But all of that will still always be your own Mind. There is no limit at all to what consciousness can imagine. And it can imagine some insane stuff that you would not believe.
</p>

	So while I'm saying your current experience is all there is, that does not mean your current experience cannot radically change. It can and it will -- and there is worthwhile stuff to explore. By all means take a rocket ship to Mars, if you dare. You will discover cool and useful stuff. Or if you really want a mindfuck, smoke some salvia.

<p>
	This is very problematic since the definitions of "unfit" will be subjective, biased, partisan, and corrupted.

Even judges, down from the local level all the way up to the US Supreme Court, never get elected into office same way politicians do. It the same way that other kinds of professionals such as Medical, healthcare experts and professionals, Attorneys, Architects, Engineers, schoolteachers, college and university professors, school Principals, Vice-Principals, Deans, University Chancellors, members of any of kind of law enforcement, high ranked firefighters, mid to high ranked military soldiers, high-powered executives of huge corporations, etc. don't get picked by being elected by people including laymen.

	You can find plenty of terrible politicians who will pass that screen. For example, Ted Cruz or Josh Hawley.

<p>
	Cheer up bro. Have a long-view perspective. Covid will end and you will get much better with girls if you work at it. Jocks don't matter. So all is good. If the girls are as slutty as you say, then you should have no problem sleeping with them. Sluttiness works in your favor if you make yourself into a high quality guy. She will fuck a few jocks, then fuck you, see how much better you are, and stick with you.

<title>God CANNOT Be Separated from Religion</title>

That means I was right after all." And then they never deconstruct their religious beliefs and attachments -- which is absolutely crucial in this work.
</p>

<p>
	So I would much rather tell a person who loves religion: "Religion is bullshit. Throw it all away. You won't miss anything." rather than telling them how wonderful religion is.
</p>

<p>
	Mostly, religion is a virus and straight-jacket of the mind. Even though beneath that lies some deep truth. But you won't access that truth without being willing to throw away your religion. Hence the paradox of religion.

<p>
	Stop thinking negative thoughts and just go out and talk to more girls. That's the simply solution. You can't think your way out of this situation.
</p>

<p>
	Be very mindful of your negative thoughts. You need to learn to channel your mental energies towards productive action.
</p>

<p>
	Move to a city which has lots of hot girls. Talk to them frequently. Problem solved. If you can't move now, start making plans to move and build the resources to move. This laying of plans will lift your depression.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're depressed is because you have no hope. And the reason you have no hope is because you're not thinking far enough outside the box and taking radical ownership of your life situation.
</p>

<p>
	You are young and there are literally thousands of hot girls you can meet and sleep with if you really wanted to. But you don't really want to do the work for it. Hence you're depressed.
</p>

Reddit is a company with a reputation to unhold. It cannot allow devils to run rampant on its platform. This is not an elitist thing, it's about being non-radical to appeal to mainstream audiences.
</p>

<p>
	What you guys don't get is that once a company is large enough, it has to cater to mainstream tastes. It no longer has the luxury of being radical or niche. This is why CNN cannot be the socialist channel that progressives want. CNN has to cater to a much later audience than radical progressives. If CNN was a socialist channel, it could not have the same level of ubiquity and cultural authority that CNN has. CNN is like mayo or vanilla. It's not supposed to be full of bold flavor because bold flavor turns people off.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise, Reddit and Robinhood cannot allow themselves to become tools of some radical agenda because their goal is to be huge mainstream platforms. Platforms are not supposed to be radical, subversive, or partisan. They need to be vanilla.
</p>

<p>
	Of course both far right and far left people hate this, because they want to weaponize these platforms to attack their enemies. This is why both the far right and far left constantly bash "the mainstream media." They want to turn media into weapons and tools to serve their personal biases and worldviews -- for good or for bad. And of course mainstream organizations refuse to do this. Not because there is some elitist conspiracy to control the world, but because that is the nature of being mainstream.

	The key feature of devils is that they always adapt. Devilry is survival and adaptability, first and foremost. So if you think the devil will just peacefully rot to death in rigidity, you don't understand devilry. The devil will twist itself like a slippery eel.
</p>

<p>
	The real question is, what will the Republican party twist itself into? Because it certainly will not admit its own wrongness.

</p>

<p>
	But consider this point seriously:
</p>

<p>
	The fact that you cannot locate a single example of a truly socialist country out of some 300 on the planet, and hundreds more across history, should give you some pause as to whether such a system is sustainable or even desirable.
</p>

<p>
	I would say the same thing to a libertarian. Where are these wonderful libertarian countries? Oh, they don't exist and never existed? Well, maybe that's because your ideas are more a fantasy/ideology than a workable, scalable system.
</p>

<p>
	You can always make the excuse that it could happen in the future. And it could. But then the burden of proof is on you that such a system is workable. You have to do some heavy lifting there rather than just blindly assuming it will all work out.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarians and socialists alike have a lack of humility about their systems. They just cockily assume, without any hesitation, that it will just work.
</p>

<p>
	It just works <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	Most people have no interest in developing themselves.
</p>

<p>
	It is actually rare for someone to outgrow the stage they were raised in -- as that requires emotional labor and people are lazy.
</p>

<p>
	It's extremely rare for someone to grow by 2 stages or more.

<p>
	Yes, your entire mind is just a bag of tricks you use to keep yourself locked in the illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Even your birth. It did not happen. Just a trick of your mind. You have existed here/now forever, imagining shit around you, like births and deaths.

	"Hell" is a subjective notion.

<p>
	Some people can stand a deeper hell than others. The more conscious you are, the less hell you can stomach. Since you want something higher.

			Are you saying that as this is a dream there would be no limits to awakening, infinite degrees?  We could only ever be partially awake, that would be the point of dreaming? Wouldn’t such a progressive path imply time?<br />
			On the other hand, we are God & wouldn’t being aware of that fact be full awakening in the ever present now?

<p>
	I don't know if there is infinite awakening literally. But there are many degrees of them for sure.
</p>

<p>
	For example, many so called awakened people are not actually conscious of what God is. Because that requires deeper awakening.

<p>
	Yes, exactly. You see, that is how God fools himself into buying the illusion. God fools you with your compassion and care for others. Your desire to help others and comfort them is a huge part of the illusion you have spun for yourself. This emotional hook keeps you locked in the dream. The dream would not feel real unless it had powerful emotional hooks.

</p>

<p>
	A mystical experience would have you pee your panties.
</p>

<p>
	Understanding of relativism does not by itself necessarily lead to a mystical experience, although some mystical experiences can reveal the profound relativity of reality.
</p>

<p>
	For example, can you see that the difference between getting a hug or getting kicked in the face is purely relative, purely bias?
</p>

<p>
	In other words, if you were conscious enough, the difference between the two would disappear, since what does God care if it gets hugged or kissed? God is symmetrical in all possible ways.

	Don't qualify yourself or seek to impress. Rather deflect her trap by saying something like, "When I crash, it will be all passenger side, Don't worry, your death will be quick and relatively painless."

	Overall you are too serious. Be more playful and fun and illogical and nonsensical and emotional. Turn on some dumb music in the car and sing and dance with her. Tell her stories.

<p>

<p>
	Yes, it is God dreaming and fantasizing.

<p>
	Ego is just the fantasy that you are a human. Simple.

<p>
	You are profoundly underestimating the illusion. Even "enlightened" teachers like Spira or Shinzen or Ramaji underestimate it. They are not fully awake. Still trapped in illusions, bullshitting themselves and their imaginary students.

<p>
	You are right in that devil is a relative notion. It does not exist in an absolute sense. So you have to be very conscious to understand its limits and use it relatively.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is you guys take the word too seriously, as if it has some ontological or moral substance. Rather, say it tongue-in-cheek, like I do.
</p>

<p>
	It's a fun word. Sorta like calling someone a douche. You don't take it too literally.

<p>
	And that's it. Nothing more.

<p>
	The problem is you can't accept it.

<p>
	Ya'll should read the book, House of Trump, House of Putin. It reveals the staggering Redness of Trump's monsterous ego. The sad thing is that Trump is way worse than anyone knows or anything the media has revealed in the last 4 years. He has stolen, defrauded, and laundered billions for the Russians.
</p>

<p>
	And Beck is deeply wrong about Russia too. Russia is absurdly corrupt with Red. Whichever Russians he meets with are not the Russians in power. Russia is a Red ass mafia state.
</p>

<p>
	RussiaGate is real and it's deep. Don't listen to foolish progressives who deny it. Read the book if you want to know how deep RussiaGate goes.
</p>

	People tend to be gullible and self-biased. They don't question things deeply. SD without a deep epistemic study of one's own self-deceptions and biases is weak sauce.

<p>
	See, I don't listen to Beck or Wilber or anyone. I think everything through from stratch on its existential merits. Which allows me to catch their mistakes. If you blindly copy the math teacher's work you will copy all his mistakes.

</p>

<p>
	Did 9/11 advance democracy? Did MAGA? Did the Capitol riot? Did slavery? Did capitalism? Did socialism? Did Hitler? Do hedge funds? Does Wall Street?
</p>

<p>
	Who's to say? It's not as clear as people think.
</p>

<p>
	You say that this Reddit stuff advances democracy. But that's not so clear to me.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you can make an argument that anything advances democracy, if you take a wide enough perspective. Hence our disagreement.

	The higher your perspective gets the less there is to criticize, until it gets high enough and then you become silent because it is Perfect. This is the problem with all these debates. It's an argument over nothing.

<p>
	1 million is a tiny slice of the world population. My channel is fulfilling my stated goal. If I was grifting and clickbaiting to attract more subscribers then you might have a point. But I do the opposite. My videos are less mainstream than ever in trying to appeal to people's low consciousness cravings.

<p>

<p>
	I don't advocate skipping Green, unlike say, Ken Wilber & Beck. I am generally very supportive of Green and I'm the guy who told you guys that the next stage is Green.

And this is the deeper value of this situation.

<p>
	That's all fine, but these Reddit daytrader are not your friend.

<p>

<p>

			So, do you think that there is absolutely no value in the attention this creates, in order to change the rules of the game? Or that the negative it creates outweighs the positive? How does change happen without attention? This is essentially saying that there needs to be no "marketing" for changes to take place. Sounds naive to me.

<p>
	I doubt this will create the change you want.
</p>

<p>
	I see this as a sort of virtual riot. And while I understand why people riot and how Wall Street maybe deserves some riots, I'm not really supportive of riots because they are unconscious and get out of control.
</p>

<p>
	In general, I am wary of stage Green mob activities. Although I understand why they happen and perhaps they are necessary in some cases. But they can easily get out of hand. I can't be optimistic about mobs of angry people doing stuff out of spite.
