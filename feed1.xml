	Sadhguru is way too advanced for most people here. Maybe after 10 years of diligent work you'll be able to understand him.

			Osho would absolutely agree with me. He would say something along the lines of, you cannot fight something created by the mind (toxic masculinity) with something created by the mind (toxic feminism). Can only shine light on the darkness. Your not going to fix machismo by shunning machismo. Only by giving these men the love that they need and are lacking so much in this day and age, will toxic masculinity be healed. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The difference is, toxic feminism is something your mind created.
</p>

<p>
	Feminism just seeks equal rights. Yet you perceive that as toxic because it threatens your identity.

<p>
	Definitely, definitely. Low consciousness politicians always use the most base survival threats to win elections.

<p>
	Case in point: Trump

	That's how devirly works. Fear, division, and distraction is the name of the game.

<p>
	Toad venom is at least 3x to 5x less potent per mg. So be sure to factor that into your calculus.
</p>

<p>
	1 gram of synthetic is worth about 3-5 grams of toad venom.

<p>
	A special attachment is formed which feels irreplaceable, yet it is replaceable and there's nothing objectively more special about one person than another.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same as love for one's children. Your children seem special, but honestly, they are no more special than any hungry kid off the street. If you were truthful you'd admit it.
</p>

<p>
	The ego creates this massive bias for the purposes of its survival. It's the epitome of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	You need to lie to yourself that your children are special, otherwise there'd be no compelling reason to protect them from annihilation.
</p>

<p>
	So what? This doesn't contradict the law.
</p>

<p>
	When understanding such spiritual laws, you have to understand them holistically, not in this nitpicky way of yours. The law does not say that you can't have some accident befall you. Something else is being said.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than trying to debunk the law, try to understand what it is trying to communicate to you.

<p>
	I would add <strong>Universal Law #6:</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Everything that happens is a manifestation of Love. No exceptions.
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot see how this is so, broaden your perspective until you see how it is so. Inability to see it demonstrates a narrowness of perspective.

I could meditate for 30 years and not come anywhere near the deepest realizations I've had on psychedelics. Maybe somebody could do it, but not me.
</p>

<p>
	When I look around at most enlightenment teachers, I find their teachings to be shallower than the things I've realized on psychedelics.

</p>

<p>
	But what I'm telling you is, awakenings can occur at any stage. They will then be filtered and understood through the lens of that stage.
</p>

<p>
	This notion of "full enlightenment" that you guys like to use is absurd. It's sloppy and creates many foolish conclusions.

	Yes, you are transformed by Love. But how much exactly is hard to say. Depends on how deeply you realize it. And even so, developing the mind takes work.

			In China they have their own local Google -- 10 Cents, for instance. And other IT giants. And they do well, even though "it's China". How come? In Russia there's Yandex which is also succesful. In Israel there're many IT companies. All works and does so successfully. In all these countries, you imply, the society isn't as conscious and developed on the Spiral Dynamics Level as in the US. Then how does all that exist then and generates profits?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Are you seriously comparing a company like Yandex or Baidu to Google? They are not evem in the same ballpark.
</p>

<p>
	A company like Google simply could not exist in China or Russia.
</p>

<p>
	Google is a highly advanced, conscious company. You don't even realize. They put enormous effort and resources in retaining worldclass talent. Google goes way beyond generating a profit. It is a whole different paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Any fool can be successful, but only Google is Google.

		<p>
			I'd rather work in Thailand or Singapore or Turkey, for instance, where I can grab fresh fruits <strong>on the street</strong>, <strong>sold by individuals</strong>, for $0.5-1 USD and fresh prepared 1 liter of juice for 1-2 USD. In Singapore more expensive.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the US I'd have to go to supermarket and buy that for how much? 10 times more expensive, right? In a plastic container. The quality would worse becase it's sold in a supermarket and from a refrigerator, with, possibly, chemicals.
		</p>

		<p>
			Or even in India - they have great, cheap and heathy food.
		</p>

		<p>
			What if you fell sick in the US? Huge problem, no?
		</p>

		<p>
			In India? The medicine and doctors are around 100 times cheaper.

<p>
	You grossly romanticize these 3rd world countries. No serious people want to live there because of how much they suck in ways you can't yet imagine. These countries are corrupt to hell, full of toxic chemicals, censorship, and many other problems. The food is cheap because it's toxic junk and no one wants to live there.
</p>

<p>
	If all you value is cheapness, then sure, those countries look appealing. But people who generate serious income have way higher standards.
</p>

<p>
	The development level of a country is directly related to the development level of a company like Google, which is an advanced stage Green company. It would never have arisen in China or India.

</p>

<p>
	Love is part of enlightenment.

<p>
	The fact you gotta face is many serious Zen masters were stage Blue.

</p>

<p>
	Take a look at Osho. He was obsessed with materialistic luxury even though he was supposedly very enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Take a look a Zen monks during WWII. They supported fascism and Japanese nationalism, even though they were supposedly enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Being awake does not mean you have an advanced mind or an advanced value system.

</p>

<p>
	Many stage Blue yogis have an ethnocentric worldview. They could be very partial to Indian culture, holding it as superior to all other cultures. Even Sadhguru seems to not be immune to this trap to some degree.
</p>

<p>
	Oddly enough, you can be conscious of Universal Love but still be a racist or misogynist. Childhood attitudes tend to run deep and enlightenment will not necessarily transform them automatically.

<p>
	That's what psychedelics are for.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it won't last. You can't ever be a kid again. You know too much now.
</p>

<p>
	You also over-romanticize how great it was to be a kid. It wasn't as great as you remember because your mind filters out all the bad stuff.

<p>
	Such a question does not even enter the mind of a straight guy. There's just zero attraction towards men and zero threat from gay men.
</p>

<p>
	When I used to do a lot of pickup, I'd sometimes have a gay guy hit on me. It was never an issue. It's actually flattering.

	Not the ego. Mostly it resides in your bodily urges. Similar to food. Hunger does not reside in the ego. It is more fundamental. The body likes whatever it likes. Don't over think it.

<p>
	That's an illusion. You'll see.
</p>

<p>
	She is precisely replaceable. Not only that, but you WILL replace her.
</p>

<p>
	But for a short while you'll suffer. Because that's the nature of irrational attachment. Notice that when you put something up on a pedestal in your mind, you create your own suffering.
</p>

<p>
	The whole key to dating women is: Don't get attached to her AT ALL until at least you sleep with her. Any attachment you create before that will only create needless suffering and usually ends up ensuring you never sleep with her.
</p>

<p>
	All romantic love is pure illusion. It's as illusory as jerking off to a celebrity in your mind. Only here you're using a real person to jerk off into -- which allows you to fool yourself into thinking it is real. Nope. Still pure fantasy.

<p>
	Stay calm. Give it a few days. It will pass and you'll forget all about it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics don't last more than a day or two. Anything else is your own mind at work, perhaps shadow material arising. The substance is certainly long gone from your system.
</p>

<p>
	Not that I recommend it, but you could always distract yourself with a TV show or a video game after a bad trip. That can help to take the mind off it until the memories fade away. Memories of a trip significantly fade after 1 week and after a month it's hard to recall much at all.

	Las Vegas is a great city. Everything you need with none of the smog and traffic. And good weather most of the year except summer. Close to many national parks. Zero state income tax. The city itself is quite liberal.

<title>Drugs Legalization in Poor Countries</title>

<p>
	Most drugs are illegal because parents are terrified of their kids doing heroin, crack, cocaine, & meth. And to be fair, this is a legitimate concern. These drugs can be extremely destructive. I have an extended relative in Russia who's a life long heroin addict. He's spent a few years in prison and still does heroin. It's ruined his whole life and he's a huge drag on his family because he cannot maintain a job.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics got lumped in with all that.
</p>

<p>
	The issue of heroin, crack, cocaine, & meth is tricky. How should we regulate such drugs? Do we allow them to be sold at the pharmacy? Do we ban them, creating a black market? It's bad either way. Ideally we raise the quality of our society such that people never want to do those hard drugs. But that's going to take centuries of growth. In the meantime it will be a problem either way.
</p>

<p>
	People who get hooked on hard drugs usually don't have much of a life and little hope for a good future. They lack a positive life purpose to work towards. Society needs to provide people with more opportunities for success.
</p>

<p>
	One thing is clear though, psychedelics need to be legalized and actually put to use for helping those hooked on heroin, crack, cocaine, & meth. That's a no-brainer. It's proven to work.
</p>

<p>
	I've never snorted oxalate, but snorting HCl is quite unpleasant. The only thing that takes the edge off is the epic nature of the trip itself. The whole process is inferior to plugging.

	Get your blood work done. Check your thyroid and hormones. Many people have thyroid or hormone imbalances. Low energy is often associated with under-active thyroid.
</p>

<p>
	Of course cleaning up your diet is very important. If you eat shit you will feel like shit. Stop eating all wheat products and all junk food. Carb heavy foods make you extra sleepy.
</p>

<p>
	You should also do a urine test for heavy metal toxicity. Heavy metals like mercury and lead cause all sorts of energy problems. There are detox protocols for detoxing heavy metals if you have them.

<p>
	If we injected snake venom into your veins, you'd also lose some control.
</p>

<p>
	Physiology is more fundamental than your ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	More fundamentally, the whole notion of "control" is deeply dualistic and delusional.
</p>

<p>
	If there exists only one thing in the universe: the universe itself, who controls it? Who controls the universe?

<p>
	It already IS extremely appealing for corporations. Corporations are making a killing. They ain't going anywhere. These are empty threats. They only ship the lowest jobs overseas. Management lives here for a good reason.
</p>

<p>
	What you gotta see is that a popular country has enormous leverage over corporations. A popular country has what the corporations want most: 1) a big market of consumers, and 2) the top talent in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck running Google in China or Brazil. The world's best computer engineers don't want to live in China or Brazil when they could be living in the Bay Area. The best talent comes from high consciousness societies. This is not an accident. That's the whole point of a constructing a high consciousness society.

</p>

<p>
	The problem in Brazil is massive corruption, lack of infrastructure, and low levels of Spiral development across the populace. Brazil has a lot of stage Red which makes progressive reforms very difficult.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Red will behave criminally regardless of drugs being legal or illegal.
</p>

<p>
	It's very easy to acquire drugs in Brazil if you want. So it's not like it is being stopped under current policy.

<p>
	I am not for isolation. Globalism will only grow larger.
</p>

<p>
	But people will want to live in the most developed and conscious countries. The whole point is to make America extremely appealing to live in -- much more appealing than now.
</p>

<p>
	Expecting American citizens to pay taxes is not isolationism. If you don't want to pay taxes, fine. Then surrender your citizenship. To not pay your fair share of taxes is literally leeching off your community. It is the most unpatriotic thing you could do. Basically it's treason.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if tax evasion was tried in court as treason.

<p>
	By your logic the US should not have child labor laws because it would be bad for companies and they would just move overseas and exploit children there.
</p>

<p>
	You are thinking about this all wrong. The point of these policies is to create a more healthy, conscious, loving society. This comes at the cost of maximization of profits and growth. This is a big shift in paradigm. A more conscious society will become more powerful than all other societies in the long term even if it doesn't maximize profits. Precisely BECAUSE it doesn't maximize profits!
</p>

<p>
	You cannot even begin to imagine how powerful America would become if we passed all these changes I propose. Consciousness and Love is the ultimate power.

<p>
	I don't see rich people moving overseas a problem.
</p>

<p>
	Rich people want to live in America and benefit from American real estate, schools, and society. They do not want to live in a 3rd world country. They don't want their children living in a 3rd world rat hole.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise, giant corporations want to be headquartered here. To do serious business here, they must be here.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, under current law, if you are a US citizen and you move to another country, you still owe the IRS income tax. If you want to escape US income tax, you have to renounce your citizenship.
</p>

<p>
	It's very easy to pass some laws that further tighten this. If a corporation over $1 billion wants to do business in the US, they must place a headquarters here.
</p>

<p>
	The Chinese do not allow any America company to work in China without partnering with a local Chinese company first.
</p>

<p>
	Silicon Valley is not going to pack their stuff and move overseas. They don't even want to move to Alabama, let alone overseas.
</p>

	Red is going to be dictatorial.
</p>

<p>
	See Russia or North Korea or Iraq for more modern examples of Red.
</p>

<p>
	Saddam Hussein is a great example.

<p>
	No it would not because people like to live in uncorrupted countries with great infrastructure.
</p>

<p>

It's like having a discussion with a man-child. There's no historical understanding there of how government works. Just ravings about how evil government is.
</p>

<p>
	These positions are often held by young juvenile white males. It's a rebellious phase they grow through. Unfortunately some get stuck on it for life.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarianism is a cancer of the mind.

<p>
	Wind is not even necessary. Everything can be solar. Solar is the ultimate energy source because it is virtually unlimited. We just need more cells and batteries, which will naturally happen.
</p>

<p>
	We can install solar panels on every rooftop in the world. This is the future. Solar is only going to get cheaper and more efficient.
</p>

<p>
	Coal and nuclear is already going out of business. With a proper carbon tax, solar will become king.

	I explained it a lot in my video: What Is Love?

<p>
	And we'll certainly talk more about it in future episodes. But talking about it is also quite pointless. You cannot understand Love through talk. You must find it by doing the practices. You must open your heart.

<p>
	What good does it do for me to tell you that everything is love? It's as useless as telling people that they are God. Telling people doesn't work. They must awaken to it.

<p>
	What you're asking cannot really be explained. You gotta undertake a personal journey of validate various religious and scientific metaphysical claims.
</p>

<p>
	Reading an explanation in a book doesn't help because that's just begging the question. That book then becomes your new dogma. You need to find a way to determine which books you can trust. You cannot do that based on my recommendations because do you not know if I am correct or not.
</p>

<p>
	The pursuit of truth must be independent of all human sources.

<p>
	That's very wide question. A whole book could be written about that because there is so much stuff religions say.
</p>

<p>
	God, for example, is not a dogma. But! For most religious people it is.
</p>

<p>
	Dogma is not just about true vs false, dogma is about how you hold it. If a perosn holds a true thing as a belief which he has no direct experience of, it's still a dogma.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if you are absolutely sure the Earth is round, that's a dogma, even if the Earth turns out to be round once you look down on it from orbit.
</p>

<p>
	But if you have actually seen the round Earth with your own eyes, then it's not a dogma.

<p>
	I doubt total harmony is possible. Total harmony is death. There will always be stuggle in life. That's the nature of survival. It's just a question of how much harmony and complexity a particular stage of cognitive development can sustain.

<p>
	China is mosty stage Blue and they have over 1 billion people. Of course they are an ecological disaster, but they do live in some degree of harmony as a society.

<p>
	Absolute Love is idenetical to your true nature.
</p>

<p>
	There are facets to the Absolute. These facets can be realized in any order and at various levels of comprehensiveness.
</p>

<p>
	But don't be confused, all of these facets are identical to one another in the end. But even so, it is important to realize them individually. It is not enough to realize one facet and think you automatically understand all the rest, even though they are one in the end.

<p>
	WinterKnight is not conscious what love is. He has not had an awakening to Absloute Love.
</p>

<p>
	I keep telling you guys, this goes way deeper than you think. There are many facets to awakening and very few people have become conscious of all of them.
</p>

<p>
	Most of the people you look up to, who you think are fully awake, are not.
</p>

<p>
	This work is extremely, extremely tricky.

<p>
	That's the whole magic of reality. There isn't one! So there is no one in the universe to say what is real. So people make up all sorts of shit.

	The nature of reality is that there is no external source you can turn to for clear answers because due to nonduality, all sources are actually yourself.

<p>
	This was the point of my: How Authority Works video.

<p>
	People have various levels of awakening, and beyond that, their minds can interpret their awakenings in very different ways. People's brains also function differently, producing different realities.

<p>
	Taxing rich people doesn't cripple their motivation. This is a myth.
</p>

<p>
	Money is an improper motivator in a conscious society. You would have our most creative people be prostitutes. This is an insult to turly creative people.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't assume wealthy people are the most creative people. Right now, the wealthiest people are often the best exploiters of society. Why should such exploitation be rewarded?

</blockquote>

<p>
	The smaller states are over-represented in the Senate. In fact this is one of our biggest problems. The least developed rural states have a majority strangle hold over the Senate which makes it impossible to pass progressive legislation.
</p>

<p>
	What the smaller rural states don't appreciate is just how much their boats are lifted by the largest and most progressive states like NY, California, Washington, etc. These states pay the bulk of taxes because they add massive economic value. Yet their votes are not worth as much.
</p>

<p>
	Votes should be allocated by people, not by state. Otherwise you have a backward democracy where the minority opinion actually rules the majority. Just think about it, why should a president with the minority of popular votes win while the one with the majority lose? It makes no sense. If the guy you voted for won the popular vote but lost the election, you'd rightly be upset. Especially if two such elections lead to disastrous policies like the Iraq War and the Trump administration. What makes all this particularly galling is that the most conscious candidates are actually winning the popular vote, but still losing the election!
</p>

<p>
	If California was properly represented under the principle of 1 person, 1 vote, America would be able to pass significantly more progressive legislation. Right now we have the least developed parts of the country cockblocking humane legislation.
</p>

<p>
	California, NY, and Washington lead the way on progressive legislation: clean air, clean energy, living wage, etc, etc. Alabama ain't putting forth the most conscious & loving policies.

			What do you all think of people like Matt Kahn? (especially you "awake" people on this forum) He seems to have a lot of contradictory information and states that since we are in the 5th dimension now, what worked in the past simply doesn't work anymore. He generally doesn't like a lot of the teachings like, the drop your story, the world is an illusion, there is no self. He says those are all stages that you need to wake up from quickly because they are <strong>not</strong> helpful. I understand the goal of self inquiry. But Matt Kahn says you come back to the body to fully be the character that you are, so all of this, "who is the one typing?", "there's no one there", although true, is NOT USEFUL.

And all of this through self love, which doesn't really seem to get talked about a lot here. Leo talks a lot about how enlightened people are humble. That's close, but how important is Self love in an enlightenment journey?

<p>
	That's also right. Love is ultimately where all this no-self business leads. Absolute Self Love is the end result of profound enlightenment.

	It doesn't contradict Self Love. These are two sides of the same coin. So don't turn this into a false choice. Realize no-self. Realize The Self. Realize God. Realize Love. Realize Infinity. Realize Nothingness. Then you will be ready to save the world.

<p>
	Yes, they are mostly Purple in their cognitive development.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be nuanced here and distinguish various developmental lines: moral, interpersonal, political, cognitive, spiritual, and so forth. While their spiritual line could be advanced, their other lines can be very low.
</p>

<p>
	Those tribes are not all rainbows and butterflies. They will rape you and boil your skull for dinner if you are from the wrong tribe. Tribal warfare is a notorious problem.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, I know that many of you are averse to psychedelics, so when I say practices, I mean all the traditional practices as well.
</p>

<p>
	I have given you guys lists of practices in the past.
</p>

<p>
	You also have to keep in mind that I share some extremely advanced insights on my blog and in my videos. Some of the things I talk about will not be understood hardly by anyone. And that's okay. Most people here are not really seriously interested in Truth or understanding, you're here for the smaller purpose of improving your life. So what that means is you will not access the deepest things I talk about, but you can still improve your life significantly.
</p>

<p>
	Accessing the deepest things I talk about will require something special -- whatever that means. But don't worry. Even if you only access 30% of what I talk about you will be in the top 0.1% of mankind.
</p>

Going down this line of logic is only going to confuse you further.
</p>

<p>
	You will only understand these things AFTER some enlightenment experiences. Trying to reason out the answers ahead of time will not work.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, not if you're doing it right.
</p>

<p>
	Stop doubting and start doing the practices.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a belief-based teaching. God is not a concept, God is you.

<p>
	It has to be communicated in the proper ways.
</p>

<p>
	Simplistic ways as in the story above are too ineffective.

<p>
	Give that student 30mg of 5-MeO-DMT, and maybe he'll get it.

<p>
	Your questions are confused because you are imagining a difference between God as disincarnate and as incarnate. The two are one.

			Also how does astrology foresee so many things of the future, for me the predictions were mostly correct.

<p>
	Science too can predict the future (to an extent). Infinite Consciousness is able to anticipate its own unfolding.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Consciousness is the sum total of all possibilities. What gets manifest right now depends on you.
</p>

<p>
	I can predict that your hair will turn grey. Is that because of destiny? No. It's because of understanding various patterns of the universe.

<p>
	The future is not predetermined. The future will be whatever God decides it to be. Which means, whatever we decide it to be, since we are God. The unfolding of life IS the very mechanism by which God creates the future.
</p>

<p>
	This is it! God is deciding right NOW what the future will be! You are doing it!
</p>

<p>
	If you decide to pick your nose, that's what God decided. Until you pick your nose, God hasn't decided it.
</p>
