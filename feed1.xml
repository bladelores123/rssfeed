So lots of research, study, and practice with the topic you're talking about is key.
</p>

<p>
	2) You must also be genuinely passionate and interested in the topic.
</p>

<p>
	3) Practice, practice, practice. Don't think too much, just let your mouth move and say whatever it feels like saying. You can polish it up with more practice.

<p>
	Don't worry about them. You don't need them. The basic Kriyas should be enough if you just do them seriously.

</p>

<p>
	Also, don't expect shamanic breathing to fix all your bad habits for you. It can help you release some of the low consciousness motives driven them, but you'll have to consciously and proactively put an end to them.
</p>

<p>
	Try starting a Kriya yoga practice. It should be better than meditation.

<p>
	You say that so flippantly because you haven't even come close to experiencing God. That's your ego talking. And ego hates God.
</p>

<p>
	The name/word is given so that we can communicate effectively with one another. Right now, you are missing the communication because you believe God cannot exist. And I'm tell you, you're wrong. You are further complicating your error by appeal to the argument, "But God is just a word." Which is like doubling-down on your mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Platypus is also just a word. But there is such a thing as a platypus that you can discover. It's a remarkable creature which would shock and delight you had you never seen a picture of it before. Starting a thread on a platypus forum that goes: "Platypus Do Not Exist: platypus is just a word" only makes you stuck.
</p>

<p>
	Open your mind to the possibility that God does exist. Then proceed with your practices. And then maybe one day, in 10 years, you will discover something amazing that you couldn't imagine in a million years.

</p>

<p>
	Nonduality means there cannot be any "other" who is not you. The deepest levels of nonduality can make you start to feel lonely, as you realize that you created this entire dream all by yourself and the illusion of "otherness" gets shattered. It can feel very solipsistic, but also, as the mind adjusts to your new understanding, the loneliness should dissipate.
</p>

<p>
	I do not exist. You created this forum to entertain yourself. And here you are reading all these posts that you yourself wrote to yourself. Seeking advice from "others" who are really just yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Try to see the beauty of that.
</p>

<p>
	Aloneness and connection are ONE. You can look at it like the glass is half empty, or the glass is half full. By being everyone, you are infinitely connected to everyone.
</p>

<p>
	You still haven't surrendered fully to nonduality. Yes, it's very radical and scary to surrender fully to it. The truth is radical beyond words. Your fear of being totally alone is precisely what you must explore and ultimately surrender. The ego-mind hates it of course and will be resistant, trying to anchor itself into something, anything to avoid Absolute Nothingness and Total ONENESS.
</p>

Consciousness itself is prior to space, time, and motion.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Undifferentiated Consciousness is so nondual, it's like an infinite singularity, where nothing is distinct. The distinction between moving vs not-moving hasn't been made yet.
</p>

<p>
	All distinctions are part of the Creation. They are all forms.

			If God is existence or consciousness, what does it matter if we say God is existence or existence is existence? The majority believe God is a personified thing, we invented a personified God, we gave God a personality, now we found out that this not the case. Existence is non-personal, impersonal. Consciousness/existence exists, God does not. An ultimate causer may exists, but there is no need to call it anything, not God, nor anything.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It matters a lot. God is not merely "existence" or "consciousness". God is God. It's the actual God. Existence is deeply personal.
</p>

<p>
	The word "God" is the most accurate word. More accurate than "existence" or "consciousness". The problem is, very few of you here have actually directly experienced God.
</p>

<p>
	God is all-powerful, all-loving, infinite, intelligent, omniscient, deeply personal, eternal, formless, awesome, terrifying, magical, divine, singular, deeply paradoxical, has human-like qualities, and utterly beyond the human mind's ability to comprehend.
</p>

<p>
	Call it whatever you like, but it's there to be discovered.
</p>

<p>
	The word "God" is not confusing because it is wrong, but because it is right, but you have no reference experience for that word in your mind. I might as well be talking about colors to a blind mole rat.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	First, you awaken to discover there is no God.
</p>

<p>
	Then, you awaken deeper and discover how stupid you were the whole time for denying it.

<p>
	That in an interesting clue.
</p>

<p>
	450ug of LSD is A LOT. That should have been a hairy trip. I can trip balls on 125ug of LSD.
</p>

<p>
	3g of mushrooms is a decent dose, enough for a nice strong trip.
</p>

<p>
	If 450ug of LSD doesn't work on you, you've either got fake, watered-dose LSD, or you have a pretty high tolerance. I wouldn't be able to walk on 450ug.
</p>

<p>
	Seem like this is why the 5-MeO isn't working. You probably need a higher dose.

	Even when we ban members, their content almost never gets deleted.

<p>
	Mouse became rather obnoxious in style/tone in the week up to his banning. And I was actually on retreat in Hawaii when it happened. His ideas were never the issue, it was the edgy and insolent tone with which he expressed himself that got him banned. Most of his ideas I agreed with.

<p>
	Rectal or snort, doesn't make much difference, as long as you don't lose any of the substance to drip.
</p>

<p>
	Rectal is the far superior method vs snorting.
</p>

<p>
	It might take a few tries to perfect the method. Took me about 5 tries to really get the method down. Sometimes, if it's injected too shallow, it doesn't work as well.

Some people seem to report that 5-MeO doesn't work effectively on them. I think this is due to two key factors: 1) your brain chemistry, which is slightly different for everyone, 2) your level of mental and spiritual development.
</p>

<p>
	I think 5-MeO works much more effectively on certain kinds of minds than others.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I think it's not enough to just take 5-MeO, it's also very important to existentially question reality. If you are not deeply questioning the nature of your reality all the time, then psychedelics will probably not be very profound for you.
</p>

<p>
	How much self-inquiry have you done?
</p>

<p>
	25mg is a very strong dose for me. It's almost unbearably infinite.
</p>

<p>
	At 25mg, I cannot even remember that I ever existed. All notion of personal self disappears in a very shocking way.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind, that I had to build up to this. I didn't get that on my first or second trip. It took many trips on various substances to get to this point. And I was doing a lot of existential/metaphysical questioning along the way.
</p>

<p>
	Also, people have different tolerances for psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	That 5-MeO powder looks fairly clean.
</p>

<p>
	It would be good if you had a sense of how sensitive/tolerant you are towards other psychedelics, like mushrooms or LSD. That would help you understand your 5-MeO experiences.
</p>

So yoga has proven challenging for me.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, lots of yoga can work. You just gotta build up to it. And I did not come at this enlightenment thing from a yoga background, I came at it from a self-inquiry background.
</p>

<p>
	But also, keep in mind, a state of Samadhi is not enlightenment.

Using different words for similar things.
</p>

<p>
	Also, keep in mind, there are various degrees of liberation and enlightenment. Is Martin as awake as someone like Sadhguru? Obvious not. But that's not something to hold against him.
</p>

<p>
	I'd say he's done pretty well for himself given the fact that he hasn't done 40 years of full-time practice.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta compare realistically. Comparing yourself to someone like Sadhguru is absurd. You might as well start comparing yourself to Schwarzenegger. You ain't ever gonna get to his level if you're hanging around on this forum. You would have to dedicate your entire life to that. And you should have started back when you were 12 years old.
</p>

<p>
	You need to temper your expectations proportionally to how many hours per day you're ready to invest in this work.
</p>

<p>
	From what I can tell after questioning him fairly in-depthly in private communications. Yes.
</p>

<p>
	Although it seems he got very lucky because he himself does not know a single other person who has become enlightened after 5-MeO. I think Martin was just primed and ready for it, and the 5-MeO pushed him over the edge. He did about 10 trips plus some dozen N,N-DMT trips. And he smokes it, so they were probably some very powerful trips.
</p>

<p>
	Saying "Reality is virtual" is identical to saying "Reality is Nothing" or "Reality is an illusion" or "Reality is a hallucination" or "Reality is consciousness".
</p>

<p>
	Although I don't think Campbell actually realizes that it's not only virtual, but also infinite, and that time is NOT fundamental.
</p>

<p>
	I don't consider Campbell enlightened. Although his teachings are quite good. He's missing the final crowning insight of nonduality.

	Then why were the last two Matrix movies so terrible?
</p>

<p>
	Too much showboating, not enough metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	Wasted opportunity. I was hoping they would go deep with it and reveal that even the outside-the-Matrix world is also an illusion. There are no AIs. The Matrix is not happening inside a computer, but inside another Matrix, to infinity, with no beginning or end.

That is the Zen-master's way. He fucks with your rigid mind, to open it up.
</p>

<p>
	It's not necessarily effective though. Sometimes people just need a clear answer. Being mysterious and slippery can create misunderstanding.

</p>

<p>
	There is manly unconsciousness.

<p>
	There is girly unconsciousness.

			But LEO! How does one live without caring about anything? Isn't it true that all our needs and goals are based off of this illusion we call life, when we wake up to it, What remains? Do we stay in the human body simply to just watch the show like we do when we go to the movies or what? I personally have a few goals that make me struggle and fight for something greater than i have now, but if i ever would experience what you are describing i would probably just completely go passive, the Law of Attraction is interesting to me preciely because i want to know the HOW behind LoA, if ego death takes me i wouldn't have to search for any answer to anything anymore.

<p>
	You will go passive for a while.
</p>

<p>
	But then...
</p>

<p>
	After enlightenment, the laundry. Life goes on. Until it doesn't.
</p>

<p>
	Survival will still continue. Infinite intelligence will work through you to keep you alive. As it always has. The only difference will be, you'll be less egotistical in your manner of living. You will need less. You will stop grasping at things so much and just enjoy being.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is, surviving without ego is easier than surviving with ego. You get out of your own way. You let things flow more rather than fighting with life so much. You trust life to just unfold for you. And you stop worrying about death.

<title>Can second-order reality mold first-order reality?</title>

<p>
	You have to really understand what 1st and 2nd order reality are, otherwise your words just turn into word salad.
</p>

<p>
	For example, when you are using a computer, you are sort of altering 1st order reality via 2nd order reality. What a human sees as "moving a mouse cursor" is really 1's and 0's behind the scenes. So really you're moving 1's and 0's, but the user interface of the computer makes it feel like you're moving a mouse cursor. This makes it appear as though "the mouse cursor" is causing the computer to do stuff, but that causal connection is sort of an illusion. It's always 1's and 0's moving around. Clicking on an icon does not cause anything. It only appears to.
</p>

<p>
	What's happening in these kinds of situations is that different levels of reality are being conflated.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Nothing is inherently egoic, since ego is an illusion to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	Any so-called "egoic activity" can also be done without ego. You can even be an unegoic cannibal.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is a delusion you're bringing to the table. Or not.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like you can be a good painter or a bad painter. The goodness or badness is not in the activity of painting, it's in the skill set you bring to the activity. It would be silly to say that "painting is bad" just because you're a bad painter.

<p>
	The problem is, that's your ego-mind talking and desiring to manipulate reality.
</p>

<p>
	On 5-MeO the ego disappears as if it never existed. So all your silly goals and desires to go flying through walls or manifesting millions of dollars fly out the window. They are completely irrelevant and insignificant at that point. You have literally become God. Life is over. The end. Not only will you not care about money, you will not care about your mother & father, living or dying. You have awoken from The Matrix to see that it was all just a hallucination. You were never born and you will never die. The entire universe is yours, for eternity. You are everything in existence. The power of this is so enormous, you are shaking and crying like a baby.

<p>
	Definitely! Piece of cake.
</p>

<p>
	Start visualizing it. Then get off your ass and create it.
</p>

<p>
	You can visualize yourself buying a plane ticket, getting on a plane, flying to Mexico, and doing a 5-MeO session with Octavio Rettig or some other shaman. Just as an example.

<p>
	You are describing present reality.

</p>

<p>
	B) Don't confuse an intellectual insight of the mind with Direct Consciousness. It's one thing to imagine that the universe is infinite. That's easy. Anyone child can do that. It's a totally nother thing to actually become infinite yourself and transcend your mortality.
</p>

<p>
	You should make a distinction between intellectual realizations and changes to your physical level of being.
</p>

<p>
	You can think about infinity all day long. But that is not infinity. That is finity.

<p>
	All conspiracy theories are beliefs. This is the exact opposite of direct experience.

	And direct experience is way different than ordinary experience. Direct experience is direct consciousness. It is not ordinary human experience. Direct consciousness means you BECOME the truth, directly. It transcends perception or knowledge.

<p>
	But in Peterson's case, he seems to genuinely believe his own moralizing. Which is why he gets a bit preachy about it. It's a classic religious trap and it's holding him back from a deeper understanding of God and consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	To become truly spiritual, you have to surrender moralizing and intellectual position-taking.

<p>
	It's silly to combine yoga and psychedelics at the same time. Yoga is a disciplined routine. You do it by the book. Psychedelics will only interfere with that.
</p>

<p>
	And when you're on a psychedelic, you don't need yoga at that moment. You surrender to the trip and let it take you.

<p>
	No, it's a lot deeper than recreation.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is a preference. Even enlightenment is a preference. There's no imperative to be enlightened. You're basically doing it for shit and giggles.
</p>

<p>
	Out of all the ways you could utilize your time, psychedelics are one of the best (relatively speaking). And they produce lots of growth.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not the only game in town. There's also psychological growth, emotional maturity, shadow work, etc.

<p>
	This is far too flippant and dismissive.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy for Sadhguru to be dismissive because he's already massively enlightened. But normal folk aren't even close. So for them, psychedelics can be life-changing.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy for Arnold Schwarzenegger to say that benching 50 lbs is a waste of time. Because he can bench 700 lbs. But are you anywhere near his level?
</p>

<p>
	95% of Sadhguru's students have no idea what enlightenment is, and will never even come close to tasting it in their lifetime, I would bet.

<p>
	How many and what kinds of psychedelics has Sadhguru done?

<p>
	It is helpful. I just said it isn't a reliable way to rewire the brain.
</p>

<p>
	I have no idea what the future holds. But I see no reason to quit psychedelics on principle. Even if they don't produce a permanent enlightenment, they are still highly worthwhile and fascinating to explore. Not everything has to be purely utilitarian. You can do psychedelics just because you enjoy exploring different dimensions of consciousness, in the same way that people like to go hiking or traveling to other countries.

</p>

<p>
	Jordan Peterson is a moralist. He believes in morality, value, and meaning.
</p>

<p>
	And what I was saying in the blog post was those things are inventions. Absolute Being does not have meaning or value.
</p>

<p>
	There's no contradiction. My wording in the blog post was just ambiguous to you, especially since you didn't watch the actual debate.
</p>

<p>
	Peterson is wrong because he believes evil exists. Or at least that's what it sounds like he believes, to me.

			Correct me if I'm wrong, but among all the different ways to reach Enlightenment, it appears to me that your favorite one is psychedelics. I know that you advocate for a multi-approach path with meditation, yoga, etc., but do you think that psychedelics alone could, eventually, do the trick?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It will be very difficult to use psychedelics alone to produce enlightenment. It just won't work for most people I think because the effects tend to be temporary.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga is the more reliable method. With psychedelics as booster shots along the way.
</p>

<p>
	The issue is that the brain needs to be permanently rewired, and psychedelics will generally not do that. Yoga produces permanent rewiring.
</p>

<p>
	I've had amazing insights on 5-MeO-DMT. But a permanent enlightenment has proven elusive. The ego-mind returns.

<p>
	I find certain kinds of music enhance spiritual connection to reality. Almost like psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	And on psychedelics, with the Default Mode Network disabled, music can become orgasmicly beautiful and profound.
</p>

<p>
	I think one of the reasons music is so popular is precisely because it's one of the few sources of spiritual connection that secular people get these days.
</p>

<p>
	Going to a night club, getting drunk, and dancing around like a silly animal actually gets you outside your head. Which is why people enjoy it. It's like the church of 21st century materialistic society.

<p>
	I didn't say that.
</p>

<p>
	Visualizing can be very powerful. What I meant was that your human visualization will be limited. Not as powerful or direct as God's visualization ability, so to speak. Since your intelligence is limited.
</p>

<p>
	At very higher levels of consciousness you may be able to tap into some divine-like powers. Sages and saints have been known to exhibit miracles and so forth. That may be more than fairy tales. But you'd have to be very conscious or gifted for that sort of thing.
</p>

<p>
	God's visualization ability actually creates matter and physical reality. I don't know if humans can do that. God has infinite visualization ability and is able to creating anything it wants through raw intelligence. It is all-powerful and unlimited.

<p>
	God is a disincarnate formless intelligence which thinks reality into being through its infinite intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	You, as God, literally thought yourself into existence.
</p>

<p>
	How is that possible?
</p>

<p>
	Because you have infinite power and no restrictions other than those you imagine.
</p>

<p>
	It's a hell of a thing to realize.
</p>

<p>
	I haven't talked about what intelligence is yet. I will in the future. Intelligence is not what you think it is.

<p>
	You are a philosophical zombie right now. You just think you're not. There is no one inside you "experiencing" anything. Ego has misappropriated Absolute Being, claiming Being for its personal experience.
</p>

<p>
	Qualia is actually Absolute Being. There is no one who experiences qualia. There never was. That's a trick the ego is playing on you.

The ego-mind is too powerful to let you see it. It's got a lock on your notion of reality.

And whether something is decontructive depends on your self-agenda. Hitler's Holocaust was constructive from his POV. And the meteor wiping out the dinosaurs was constructive for many species, but destructive to the dinosaurs.
</p>

<p>
	When you judge whether something is destructive, you are effectively saying, "That is destructive TO ME and the status quo that helps my survival."
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as Absolute construction or destruction. The death of one universe gives rise to another.

<p>
	You are overlooking a very important point: that "you" is an illusion. After enlightenment, you're not identified with being human any more. Your identification shifted to Nothingness and therefore Everything. So there is nothing to improve because you are the whole universe in all its possible forms.
</p>

<p>
	How can you improve infinity? Infinity includes every possible state. So there's nowhere to run.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, the concept of "improvement" only makes sense if you assume time exists. And at higher levels of consciousness, it doesn't. You become so present to the NOW that you cannot even conceptualize a future in which something could be better or worse. And of course the concepts "better" and "worse" are just judgments of the ego-mind to begin with.

<p>
	I think they stole most of the idea from the novel, Neuromancer.
</p>

<p>
	Neuromancer explicitly has a "the Matrix" in it.
</p>

<p>
	From Wikipedia:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			The novel has had significant linguistic influence, popularizing such terms as cyberspace and ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics). Gibson himself coined the term "cyberspace" in his novelette "Burning Chrome", published in 1982 by Omni magazine.[18] It was only through its use in Neuromancer that the term Cyberspace gained enough recognition to become the de facto term for the World Wide Web during the 1990s.[19][20] The portion of Neuromancer usually cited in this respect is:
		</p>

		<p>
			The matrix has its roots in primitive arcade games. … Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts. … A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding.[21]
		</p>

		<p>
			The 1999 cyberpunk science fiction film The Matrix particularly draws from Neuromancer both eponym and usage of the term "matrix".[22] "After watching The Matrix, Gibson commented that the way that the film's creators had drawn from existing cyberpunk works was 'exactly the kind of creative cultural osmosis" he had relied upon in his own writing.'"[23]
		</p>

		<p>
			In his afterword to the 2000 re-issue of Neuromancer, fellow author Jack Womack goes as far as to suggest that Gibson's vision of cyberspace may have inspired the way in which the Internet developed (particularly the World Wide Web), after the publication of Neuromancer in 1984. He asks "[w]hat if the act of writing it down, in fact, brought it about?" (269).

<p>
	The following analogy might help you guys.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is like living life inside The Matrix.
</p>

<p>
	Truth/Enlightenment is like escaping The Matrix and realizing it's all a virtual simulation.
</p>

<p>
	Then, once you've exited The Matrix, you can re-enter it, but this time you're aware that you're inside a virtual simulation. You still have to survive if you want to stay in The Matrix, but your survival is different than ordinary survival. Ordinary survival isn't self-aware, whereas now you are surviving in a self-aware manner, and you can even bend some of the rules of The Matrix, stopping time, dodging bullets, etc. But if one of those bullets hits you in the head, you're still gonna die. At least your avatar will.
</p>

<p>
	Can you see how a question like, "How do we fight terrorism?" is a distraction from breaking free of The Matrix? Terrorism is part of the virtual simulation. If you get too wrapped up and angry about terrorism, you're losing sight of the bigger picture, which is that EVERYTHING you see is just a video game. You're getting lost in the video game world. You're confusing the video game world for Truth. Nothing is good or bad, because it's all just a video game.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if Mario, from Super Mario World, started to take his life seriously. That would be a problem. He would be too afraid of jumping on a platform, cause for him it would be life and death. He would think he only has 1 life. He would become angry and bitter at all these evil spikey dangerous turtles walking around. He would become blind to the fact that he and the turtles are actually all part of one unified simulation. And so the whole game would turn into a nightmare. All just because he takes himself too seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Mario would start a political talk radio show where he rants against spikey turtles for corrupting the fabric of Mario World. He would call for a border wall to block the spikey turtles from entering Mario World. He would recruit other inhabitants of Mario World which align with his self-agenda to bolster his cause. The turtles would do the same. The two sides would demonize each other. And then you'd have an all-out battle between the two. Neither side realizing that it's all just a virtual simulation.

<p>
	You can know suffering without holding it as "evil" or "bad" or "wrong", or judging it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there is a lot of suffering in the world. But it is not evil. And it necessary. And it is largely self-inflicted due to lack of consciousness. So if you really want to reduce suffering, it would be wise to stop judging it.

<p>
	 You are very much affected by others. "Survival" here means a lot more than just foraging for food and building shelter. You are a deeply social creature. You could not survive without other human beings. You are almost totally dependant on other human beings to keep you alive. Human survival is largely social. Which is why you care about your self-image so much. Which is why you'd be embarrassed to walk outside naked in the middle of New York City. It very much affects your survival. And which is why you might be scared to approach a girl and ask her on a date. Your survival is on the line all the time. Every action you take all day long is basically you grappling with survival. Every thought you have is you manipulating yourself to increase your survive.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the truth of this.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's a survival question, which has nothing to do with Truth or enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	The question of "How do we build a good society?" is really the question of "How do I increase my odds at survival?"
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with building a better society, but it is irrelevant to Truth. In fact, it's a big distraction from pursuing Truth. And if you try to build a better society from a position of survival, you will inadvertently cause a lot of suffering to people, because you're acting out of self-preservation, not genuine greater good.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, that it is also possible to jail a person without calling him bad or evil. You could jail him with compassion and genuinely help him to heal. I am not saying we shouldn't have laws and jails. Laws and jails are necessary in a large, complex society. But what isn't necessary is the judgment, demonization, and self-righteousness that goes along with it.

<p>
	That's fine. But that's an issue of survival. You can be enlightened and also be engaged in survival. But you're not likely to get enlightened so long as you're preoccupied with survival.

<p>
	That's because he hasn't actually become conscious of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever awakening he has had, it wasn't deep enough.
</p>

<p>
	There are many degrees of realization. And he still has a long way to go.
</p>

<p>
	His rationalist paradigm is keeping him from full surrendering to God.

<p>
	Realizing no-self is not the same thing as realizing God. God sits deeper.

There's not much choice. Either you choose to kill yourself or you choose to keep living. If you choose to keep living, then you might as well enjoy living. In which case, you might as well set some goals for yourself that you feel will please you and help the world. And then you discipline yourself to work on those goals and enjoy the process.
</p>

<p>
	That's life in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
	Even though I know it's meaningless, I still have certain things I want to get out of life, and certain things I want to create. The creativity is for its own sake. Start doing the things you find most fascinating/beautiful. Or, if you can't do that immediately due to financial limitations, then make a strategic plan to work towards that goal. Ideally, every day should be you doing your art and enjoying the process and enjoying life. You'll need a strategic plan to actualize that. But first you need to find your life purpose (the thing you find most fascinating/beautiful).
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's challenging. Some days are difficult.
</p>

<p>
	You should study enlightened masters more. The really enlightened ones say exactly that. This is actually one of the most essential features of enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	You are not deeply enlightened unless you realize that all meaning and value is a construct of the mind. "Evil" is an evaluation, and it is always a fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	There can be no peace in you unless you realize that meaning and value are things your mind creates.
</p>

<p>
	There can be no true love unless you are able to love the selfishness of others. What do you think Jesus taught you? Unconditional love. Which means, you cannot see evil any more.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that as soon as you make a judgment or evaluation of any kind, you are automatically disconnected from Truth.

<p>
	Yes, low consciousness people -- especially people who have been through a lot of personal suffering -- are reacting against that suffering by inflicting it on others. But what Peterson is not telling you is that suffering is not bad or evil. And these people are not bad or evil. That irony is that there is nothing evil about ego or selfishness. It requires ego to judge that selfishness is wrong.

<p>
	Have you seen my video: What Is The Devil?
</p>

<p>
	If not, you should really watch it. It's one of my best.
</p>

<p>
	Evil is simply a judgment the ego-mind makes because it wants to survive. See? Anything that threatens your survival you will call "evil". It's as simple as that.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the reason terrorists are thought of as evil by much of Western civilization is only because they threaten the survival of Western civilization.
</p>

<p>
	If you didn't care about survival, nothing would be evil to you.
</p>

<p>
	From God's perspective nothing is evil because God is infinite and cannot die. So it would be nice if you were able to switch your identification from being a human ego to being God. Then you'd stop seeing evil in the world. You'd see the world through God's eyes, which is ego-less.
</p>

<p>
	Since low consciousness correlates to denser ego, it also correlates to greater selfishness and greater potential for "evil" -- that is, doing selfish acts. As consciousness increases, the ego thins out, and this correlates with selflessness. Selfless people have much less need to do selfish acts. They are more loving and caring and gentle because they are not preoccupied with their own survival.
</p>

<p>
	An egoless person can sacrifice his life without much problem. Not because he is brave, but because he knows he's infinite and cannot really die.
</p>

This is not a problem per se. Sadhguru, for example, teaches you to focus your eyes upwards about 6 inches in front of your 3rd eye. The strain goes away with practice. It's not painful, it's just some mild tension. Do it gently.
</p>

<p>
	Or you can focus on other spots in the head, like the crown, which is what I do these days. I like the crown cause that's the most important chakra we want to open.

<p>
	Sit in a yoga pose and visualize loving energy flowing up your spine into your heart, then visualize your heart radiating love. Really feel it. This activates your heart chakra and helps open it up. Keep doing that and you will become more loving.
</p>

<p>
	It also helps to bring up memories of intense beauty or love that you've experienced in the past.
</p>

<p>
	You are sort of shifting your state with this technique.

Shouldn't make a difference. It's mostly a matter of style.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you distinguish between style vs substance with these techniques. A lot of yoga is about style.
