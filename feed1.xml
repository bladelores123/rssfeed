<title>Free will?</title>

<p>
	There is no egoic free will, but there is God's infinite Will, and you are God. So it goes full-circle.
</p>

<p>
	Free will vs no-free-will is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	In practice your will is a sliver of God's infinite Will, just like your intelligence is a sliver of God's infinite Intellignece. By becoming more God-like you get more will and more intelligence.

It's said tongue-in-cheek. I like to amuse myself with silly examples. Silly, but still true. It shows the absurdity of the typical human life.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it does not have to be that way. Relationships are great and I'm all for deep intimate spiritual relationships. If you manage to actually pull that off, you'll be a hero in my eyes. That's challenging stuff.

	Last year a city in Texas passed a law to ban robot brothels.

<title>Someone Reviewed Leo's Views on Enlightenment</title>

<p>
	The rabbit hole goes very deep. There are facets of the Absolute that even most enlightened people have not realized.
</p>

<p>
	This is not just a verbal or stylistic difference. You can realize Nothing but miss Everything. You can realize Everything but miss Nothing. Or you can realize them both at once to see they are identical.
</p>

<p>
	And it does not end there. There's more! There's God, there's Infinity, there's Intelligence, there's Love, there's Eternity, there's Goodness, there's Will, there's Truth, there's Consciousness, there's Paradise, and it still does not end there.
</p>

<p>
	You can spend a lot of time understanding all the above at deeper and deeper degrees of wholeness and interconnection.
</p>

<p>
	Do not expect a typical enlightened YouTuber to have that level of total understanding. This is rare, rare stuff. It requires extreme levels of seeking and openmindedness which almost no one has. Neo-advaita is not gonna cut it.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I don't claim to be awake. But I know how deep the rabbit hole goes. It's ironic how many awake people do not. See, this shit is very, very tricky. When you try to boil this work down to a binary categorization like awake/not-awake you over-simplify and distort it. If only it were so simple.
</p>

			<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="1" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/" rel="">@Leo Gura</a> Please don't call me naive. I actually agree with everything you wrote. Life IS brutal, and we only got here off the backs of countless other human and animal lives. Of course! If the natives did not eat animals, they would have died, and whether that's "right or wrong," here we are. Ta-Da! 
		</p>

		<p>
			However, I feel like you may only have part of the story here. While there is a necessary duality of cooperation vs. competition, nature as a whole is predominantly based on cooperation. Our higher light and instincts, while an integration of the two, is something that ultimately transcends human nature. Your example of the two enlightened beings highlighted something that I believe adds another twist to this story. See, two lesser men would probably debate which life was worth more, and if they couldn't reach a consensus (which they wouldn't), it would inevitably turn to a fight to the death. However, we're talking about two enlightened beings. Would they debate which life was worth more? No, that's impossible. Would they fight each other to the death? No. I firmly believe that the only conclusion to be reached, from a nondual universal perspective, is for both to die in peace. I personally would rather go out that way than to live with that on my conscience. There is something here that transcends animal instincts, to appeal to karmic balance.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm not asking you to agree with me, I'm just asking you to seriously consider this possibility. Would you sacrifice your body so that another may live? Would you kill another man so that you may live? You are both the victim and the perpetrator, so only if you answered Yes to both of these questions would your scenario play out... But would it? That's a stalemate! There would be no purpose to any of this nonsense, would there?
		</p>

		<p>
			As an example, remember the brilliant ending sequence of the two ships in <em>The Dark Knight</em>? See, the Joker was convinced that either one of the boats would blow the other up. That's human nature, is it not? And yet, it took a brave prisoner to come forward to do the unthinkable. "I'll do what you should of did a long time ago," as he threw the detonation device out the window. That was the action of an enlightened being. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course it could work that way in the most ideal circumstance. But so what? In real life that is not how 99.9999% of beings behave. I was more interested in showing you how life works.
</p>

<p>
	In practice even the most enlightened people are still forced to navigate life. Even if they don't eat people, they behave selfishly in other less dramatic ways.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, don't over-idealize enlightened people. You will be disappointed when they fail to live up to your utopian fantasies.
</p>

<p>
	You must explain why so many enlightened people act so selfishly, and your answer cannot be: because they aren't really enlightened.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Obviously not. My point is that the arguments humans have are not always small-minded.
</p>

<p>
	Who should control the Middle East? Iranians? Jews? Arabs? The US? That's not a small-minded argument. That's a serious survival issue affecting hundreds of millions of people. How is it going to get resolved? How many people are you willing to sacrifice in order to resolve that situation well? 10 thousand? 100 thousand? 1 million? 10 million?
</p>

<p>
	See, it's not so easy. Life is extremely complex and counter-intuitive. By trying to compromise you might end up getting 10 million people killed.
</p>

<p>
	Are you going to compromise or fight with the big oil companies on global warming? If global warming gets out of hand, millions of people are going to die from starvation, disease, displacement, violence, and civil war.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that small vs big is a duality. Small things lead to big things which lead to giant things. So the small details matter.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hahaha... this kind of naivete is exactly why I said what I said. This is not how life works.
</p>

<p>
	Life ALWAYS works at the expense of other life. You can minimize that to some degree, but you cannot eliminate that totally. Just the fact that you are alive means some other organism cannot be alive. For example, the fact that you were the winning sperm means that millions of other sperm had to die.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you're not yet conscious of the trade-offs and costs of life. Study more closely how life works. Life and death are a duality which necessarily must feed off itself. It's not just an accident that wolves must hunt rabbits to survive and squirrels must hunt acorns. For every acorn that a squirrel eats, that's one potential oak tree that dies. So don't think that squirrels are innocent little creatures. Squirrels are acorn murdering machines.
</p>

<p>
	This needs to be accepted and understood, not avoided or worked around. You must profoundly realize how life and death are intertwined. Otherwise you will be under the illusion that if we could just get rid of death, everything will be peachy. No! The point is to realize that death itself is inevitable. You cannot be alive without dying.
</p>

<p>
	Cooperation and competition are a duality. You cannot have a life of 100% cooperation and zero competition. You must realize how the two co-arise.
</p>

<p>
	You have a self/ego for a very good reason: because you need it to survive. Selfishness plays an important role in life. You cannot just be 100% selfless and stay alive. If that were possible, ego would not be needed and it would not exist. You must realize that selfishness and selflessness are a duality too. You cannot have one without the other.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, we can still work towards a more selfless society. But don't get overly utopian about it. People still gotta shit, eat, make money, fuck, and kill. Be clear-eyed about such realities. Life has hard stakes. Don't take survival for granted. It's very easy to create a sceneario where you will have to kill to survive, and you will. You do it every day. You just conveniently ignore it, because it's not useful to your survival. You are a survival machine first and foremost.
</p>

<p>
	When a Native American hunter killed his prey, he would say a little prayer for taking the animals life. He realized that he had to take the animal's life to sustain his own. That is what it means to be aware of your selfishness. This is not something to feel guilty about. This is something you can turn into a spiritual experience. Survival is a spiritual experience (if you look at it the right way, without taking it for granted).
</p>

<p>
	It's very important to face the brutality of life, rather than trying to avoid it, pretending like it's not there. Life is fucking brutal. Business is brutal. Relationships are brutal. Etc. This brutality is a real test of your capacity to love. Your love can become so strong precisely because life is so brutal. You can cry for every carrot you eat. "Thank you carrot, for giving me your life. I promise to use your energy towards the highest good."
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If two enlightened people are locked in a cage with no food, one of them will likely eat the other one. This is the nature of survival and it is not wrong. It must be accepted and embraced.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to over-idealize or over-romanticize life. People still got to eat, shit, make money, and fuck if society is to exist. Life is Love, but life is also brutal.

<title>Is having good manners and being polite stage green values?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/33745-is-having-good-manners-and-being-polite-stage-green-values/?do=findComment&amp;comment=404835</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The key thing to understand about good manners and etiquette is that they are all a social construction and a survival function. They are not absolute. The mistake that many stage Blue people make is they take manners, social norms, cultural customs, paying respect, tradition, etc as absolutes, and therefore normative. In other words, you SHOULD and MUST adhere to social norms. This is delusional.
</p>

<p>
	As you become conscious and developed you will naturally respect people without making it a dogma or a should.
</p>

<p>
	Manners, social norms, cultural customs, paying respect, tradition, etc become problematic when they are done mechanically in lieu of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Just understand that whatever your role-models hate or judge, you will probably start to hate or judge too. If your role-model has a shadow, you will tend to absorb their shadow and make it your own. Make sure you're aware of what the speaker's shadow is. His shadow is the place he's reacting from, which lessens his alignment with Truth and Goodness.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that all judgment is delusion. No exceptions.

<p>
	There is no such thing as bad, AT ALL! Bad is an egoic delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Anything which exists is Absolutely Good. Murder included and anything else you can conjure up.
</p>

<p>
	Without an ego you would not be bothered by murder.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: from the perspective of the universe as a whole, nothing can be bad because there is nothing outside the universe to contrast it with. This is one of the radical consequences of ONENESS.

<p>
	No, it makes you understand that all such things are necessary aspects of Absolute Good. You do not become apathetic. You are filled with unconditional love. The love is so deep it may seem like apathy from an egoic perspective because the ego confuses selfishness with love.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

			Because meanwhile it is technically true that the ultimate nature of reality is Good (concuousness / Brahman), that doesn't mean that empathy for those who are suffering and working towards a fully awake human community living as one in harmony peace egalitarianism and altruism suddenly get canceled even if it looks like a tall order now.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's easy for the ego-mind to see Absolute Love and spiritual detachment as apathy. It only appears that way because the ego-mind is so attached.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Love requires detachment because so long as you are attached to anything, your love is highly partial. You cannot love the whole world from a position of attachment. Anything you are attached to means you can't love its opposite. If you are attached to peace, you cannot love war. If you are attached to love, you cannot love hate. If you are attached to justice, you cannot love injustice. If you attached to beauty you cannot love the ugly. Etc. Absolute Love loves EVERYTHING! No exceptions. Anything you don't or can't love, that's ego being scared and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	So you should distinguish between dualistic love (what most people call love) and nondual Love, which knows no opposite and has no boundary.
</p>

<p>
	Like I explained in the Understanding Duality episode, good and bad are relative whereas Good is the transcendent absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The transcendence of good/bad does not leave you in a neutral place the way most people would imagine. It puts you in Heaven.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to how the trascendence of science and religion does not leave you with agnosticism, it makes you God!

<p>
	I don't know who trungpa is.
</p>

<p>
	If a teacher is an asshole, then yeah, I'd say he's got some devil in him. He has more work to do. He can be awake but he has a repressed shadow which needs work.
</p>

<p>
	There are also degrees of awakening. Such a perosn may not have awoken to absolute Love for example, which is why he's still an asshole. It's pretty easy to realize no-self without realizing God or Love or Goodness and be an asshole.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why a good Zen master will drive his students to go deeper after their first kensho. The first kensho is just the beginning. A good master will not let a student stop at the first kensho. There is what's called post-satori practice.
</p>

<title>Spiral Dynamics case study on an ex-KGB member</title>

<p>
	The key issue with nations is the stage of development of their infrastructure. It does not matter what the ideology is so much as what values the infrastructure is embodying. If the courts, police, and politicians are corrupt, and the economy is pre-industrial or only based on one resource like crude oil, and there is no seperation of chruch and state, then no Green government is possible even if a Green ideology is spread to everyone.
</p>

<p>
	It works just like with individual development. Just because you read a lot of books or watch a lot of videos about personal development does not mean you will be highly developed. It's very easy to create a lofty image in your mind of how developed you are when in reality your diet is terrible, your emotions are all over the place, you have a crazy monkey mind, your finacial situation is a disaster, you live in a bad environment, your friends are criminals, etc. Such a person will not be able to function at a high level because the infrastructure is so poor.

<p>
	Yes, the underlying motivation is the key moreso than any particular behavior. You can respectful at any stage of the Spiral. It's just that stage Blue values respect for tradition for its own sake and becomes rigid about it. For example, you must respect the Pope because he is a spokeman for the one true God, Lord Jesus Christ, and he is infallible. By not respecting him you will go to hell. Bow your head before the Pope or we may torture you for being a devil worshipper.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, that concept is straight from Zen itself. Zen masters teach about Zen devils and Yako Zen, aka "wild fox Zen".
</p>

<p>
	Technically, a Zen devil is one who practices Zen without ever reading scriptures. And a wild fox is one who only reads about Zen without practicing.
</p>

<p>
	A Zen devil will say things like, "Who cares about the suffering of others? I am liberated and suffering is an illusion so nothing matters." Or stuff like, "Who cares about global warming? The world is an illusion anyways."

<p>
	Ken has a very robust grasp of awakening and nonduality, and much more.
</p>

<p>
	His work is not just about awakening, it is about stages of development and various kinds of pathologies in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is independent of one's stage of development. Both are important. To awaken but still be stuck at a low level of development is very common and dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	If your teaching only emphasizes awakening and nothing else, it is a narrow and incomplete teaching which will produce a lot of problems if it's taught to lots of people.
</p>

<p>
	Stages of development are extremely important and yet they are virtually unknown to most teachers and traditional teachings. Which is why so many spiritual practioners come out half-baked.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot understand stages of development by sitting on a meditation cushion, even if you are the best meditator in the world. Introspection is not enough.

<p>
	Because without a self, nothing is bad.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize you are immortal and infinite (the Absolute), you will be in literal heaven, where nothing bad exists. Heaven is an Absolute!
</p>

<p>
	Once your perspective of life becomes absolutely holistic, you will literally not be able to see bad any more. You will realize that "bad" is a fictitious concept. You will realize there was only absolute Good.
</p>

<p>
	It's a life-transforming realization. This is how you transcend suffering.

<p>
	It's understandable that an ex-Soviet would have an allergy to Green and leftists because of his personal experiences with Soviet communism. The mistake though is to confuse stage Blue and even Red communism with stage Green American liberalism or democratic socialism. They are very different things and this is hard to distinguish unless you've studied Spiral Dynamics (which almost no one has).
</p>

<p>
	This is a common mistake conservatives make. They equate Bernie Sanders with Venezuela, which is absurdly bad analysis. Venezuela is closer to Republicans than to stage Green.

<title>How to allow emotions?</title>

What's required is mindfulness practice over them, and also getting to the bottom of why you feel the need to emote in those ways. See, those emotions are how the ego-self survives. So who you are results in those emotions getting acted out. Changing who you are will change those emotions and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are one of the most powerful tools for showing you a way past all that egotistical acting out. See, right now you don't even know what it means to be free of it. So it will be very tricky to stop acting out.
</p>

<p>
	You need to become deeply conscious that you are "doing" emotions as a means of ego survival. The emotions are there to keep the ego intact. The whole process is ruthlessly efficient and very tricky to stop because it is a matter of life and death from your POV.
</p>

<p>
	To change those emotions you will have to REALLY change. To become like a whole new person.
</p>

<p>
	How you define yourself is what then gets emoted. Take a look at how anger, fear, judgment, guilt, jealousy, etc. are serving to maintain your self-definition, your self-image, your persona. How would you have to change your self-image such that your habitual angers, fears, judgments, and guilt no longer needed to arise?
</p>

<p>
	What are all those emotions defending?
</p>

<p>
	This is a big can of worms which will take some serious work to sort out. But it's worth it.

<p>
	Yes. When the nonduality and consciousness of God gets really intense it will literally make you feel sick to your stomach. Although I've never actually had to follow through with it. But if there was food in my stomach I would have probably vomited.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes you feel like vomitting simply by realizing how full of bullshit your entire understanding of reality is.
</p>

<p>
	I have never run into problems tripping solo. That's with around 30-40 trips. But I am very careful when I trip. Solo tripping is ideal if you are responsible and careful. Bad trips will happen, but you just tough them out, letting them beat you up a bit, reminding yourself that this is how growing is done.
</p>

<p>
	Ideally you become your own shaman/guru without needing a Mommy.

<p>
	Yup
</p>

<p>
	To the ego it feels like a loss of meaning, purpose, and identity. It can feel depressing (for a time), like you are losing a dear friend. All of this is an illusion, but it will not feel like an illusion when it happens to you. The ego is going through its final death throes.

<p>
	Seems like you're creating unnecessary stories about this issue. Keep it simple instead: stay as alert and conscious during meditation as possible. If you find yourself falling asleep a lot, then do your practice after a nap. That's all.
</p>

<p>
	Calling sleep an "egoic activity" sets up an adversarial relationship with sleep, which is needless.

Just the fact that you are evaluating the fairness of life based on how much sex you do or do not get, is absurd. As if the universe cares about how much sexual pleasure you receive. No one cares about that but you. It's got zero importance at all in the big picture.
</p>

<p>
	Also notice how you assume that if you don't have sex, then some other guy will have sex instead of you. This is a horribly warped and biased way of looking at things. Most of the time when sex doesn't happen is has nothing at all to do with another guy stealing that sex. Sex fails to happen for many reasons, many of them valid. A lot of times sex fails to happen because it was not supposed to happen, because the chemistry was missing, because you two were not a good match for each other, or simply because the logistics and timing was bad.
</p>

<p>
	Nobody owes you sex. And nobody is competing with you for sex. Drop these toxic mindsets.
</p>

<p>
	Relate to the whole woman. Right now you are relating to the sex.
</p>

<p>
	The valid way of looking at things is: "Sexual pleasure has zero importance. If it happens, great. If not, oh well, I got important shit to do."
</p>

<p>
	Not necessarily. Shadow work is also important and it also depends how deep your emotional wounds are. If you had heavy trauma that will probably take a lot of dedicated work regardless of your meditation or mindfulness practice.

<p>
	Well, another radical solution is to become a yogi/saint and live a very simple and peaceful life. You could do that in any country and inspire others with your simplicity and goodness. Jesus or Gandhi-style. That would be a very powerful way to live.

<p>
	You are definitely in a tougher situtation than most self-actualizers here. It's not easy to self-actualize in Iraq, which is at such a low level of development.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe consider starting some kind of online business which would not be tied to the Iraqi economy. There are lots of opportunities but you have to get really creative.
</p>

<p>
	Don't rush too much. You will need to spend some number of years solidifying your base needs in a healthy way before you can really go to town on the top of Maslow's pyramid.
</p>

<p>
	Try to think of a long term strategy which will allow you to travel out of Iraq and be independent of the stuff going on there.
</p>

	Erase those vertical lines between the absolute and reality/world.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Don't feel bad. Just realize this work is extremely deep. It will take you 10-30 years of full time work to understand everything someone like Ralston has to offer. He does not lay things out for newbies like I do.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, his approach is direct, brutal, and a bit cold. You're gonna have to really work at it to understand it.

<p>
	Brutally direct teachings can be good, but they are also too advanced for most people to get results from it, and they oversimplify things too much, to the point of ignoring important complications, sticking points, pathologies, stages of development, and stuff like emotional mastery, shadow work, integration, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Brutally direct teachings often ignore the human side of this work. The pasison and the love. They can be too autistic and masculine. Some enlightened masters are basically autistic so their style will reflect that. This may not resonate well with you. Personally I prefer a more passionate, warm approach. Love has the power to transform a person like nothing else.

<p>
	That's half-true. The other half of life is seeking communion with others.
</p>

<p>
	When you become truly individual you will go full-circle and be in communion with all other individuals.
</p>

<p>
	But it is a mistake to think that life is only about being an individual because you will then create a shadow out of community.

Who is there to even say what counts as a body and what doesn't? Humans make up all such boundaries, including the boundary of human vs non-human. In other words, humans only exist as a species because we say that we do. The universe does not know what a species is.

<p>
	Truth or an absolute is not held at all. It is just what is. Isness itself is an absolute. In fact, the absolute is all there ever is.
</p>

<p>
	The present moment is absolute, but ego is not conscious of this. To be simply conscious of the present moment is the closest you can get to the absolute. Or take a psychedelic.

<p>
	1) An absolute is not a belief. You can hold a belief in an absolute, but that would be a belief, not an absolute.
</p>

<p>
	2) An enlightened person is identified with nothing. Thoughts arise, just like birds chirp when you walk outside. It's not a big deal. You don't need to kill the birds, nor do you need them chirping all the time or in any particular way. You are detached from the chirping such that it's fine either way.

<p>
	Well sure. It's not like Ken has a monopoly on this stuff.
</p>

<p>
	But as a general rule of thumb, I would never trust a professional academic's level of awakening or metaphysical understanding to be the highest.
</p>

<p>
	The wisest and most conscious people would never be academics. This doesn't mean academics don't have some valuable contributions to make. They do. But their understanding will not be too high or all-encompassing and they will miss very important facets of the big picture.
</p>

<p>
	To understand the highest stages you must look for visionaries and geniuses.
</p>

I was/am very anti-conformist like you. Nothing wrong with that. It's just a part of your personality. It might mean you should be a leader, a boss, a solo artist, or just off doing your own thing. This is great. In this case you will have to build yourself up and lead yourself a lot before others start to follow you.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be afraid to carve your own path in life. Maybe consider starting a business within a field you are passionate or curious about.
</p>

<p>
	A traditional cookie-cutter college major or job is probably not right for you. You need something more custom, more your own.
</p>

<p>
	Autistic is also okay. Just part of your personality type. You just need to find a career/purpose which leverages that.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to pursue truth is via yoga, contemplation, philosophy, self-inquiry, and/or psychedelics. So I would build experience will all the above and see how that feels for you. If you really value truth you should love all that.
</p>

<p>
	Try to think about what kind of career would be most aligned with your personality and the value of truth. It's basically that simple. Don't beat around the bush. Nail your top value.
</p>

<p>
	The core of awakening is being conscious of your true identity as Nothing. If you identify with being a body, mind, some human life, or any form whatsoever -- you ain't awake.
</p>

<p>
	What are you?
</p>

<p>
	If you have to think about it or search for it, you ain't awake. An awake person knows what they are immediately, directly.

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics breaks down around Turquoise. Ken Wilber's intergal model works much better at mapping stages above Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you cannot understand anything above Turquoise unless you become very awake and experienced with spiritual practices. Which the creators of Spiral Dynamics are not. So it is above their head.

<p>
	It's a sign that you are moving in the right general direction, but it's unclear when an awakening will come. The awakening may still be far off if you've got a lot of energtic blocks and stuff to work through. That stuff that's coming up needs to be worked through, processed, and ultimately let go of.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you're doing okay. Keep working at it. Let the energy take over you. Act it out for a bit in a safe manner and then it should leave you.
</p>

<p>
	Some sort of intense physical activity should good for acting out the energy, like boucing around on a trampolene, etc. I think the key here is to act it out rather than trying to bottle it up. So if you feel like speaking in tongues, or flailing your arms, or yelling, do it. Lock yourself in a room with a punching bag and let it all out. Do so safely.
</p>

<p>
	You need to immerse yourself more in the field and do a lot more research. As you do lots of research you will naturally start having new ideas, you will start seeing unfilled opportunities. It's very hard tobsee these opportunities without immersing yourself and lots of diverse source material.
</p>

<p>
	The secret to creativity is lots of diverse source material.
</p>

<p>
	You say you want to run seminars, but how many seminars have you attended yourself? If you attend 20 seminars I can guarantee you will have some good ideas about how to create some new kind of seminar.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you are stuck is because you lack relevant experience. So go get more experience.

<p>
	Sounds like he is afraid of commitment.
</p>

<p>
	See, a lot of men fear commitment. Men value freedom. Then as they get entangled in a relationship it feels to us like we are losing our freedom and we get doubts. That is very common in men.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like he is not mature enough to be in the kind of serious intimate relationship you want. Trying to change him will be like pulling teeth and will probably end in disaster in the end.
</p>

<p>
	You need to get better at screening guys. Is the guy aligned with your values and what you want? Trying to tame a player is not going to end well for you.
</p>

<p>
	Look for men who are more emotionally mature. Players are usually not.

After a deep trip that after-glow can last for as long as a week or two. Then usually comes a crash back to duality. So wait and see how things go.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you crash, there was still growth, so don't fret too much over it. Keep doing the work. There's always more to become conscious of.

</p>

<p>
	Do not forget that a position of agnosticism, indecision, or doubt is STILL a position, so be very careful that you don't hold it as true or absolute.
</p>

<p>
	What remains after you have doubted everything, including your doubt? Take a look.
</p>

<p>
	Have some hope that your situation is not hopeless. Genuine understanding is possible.

<p>
	That is not going to happen.
</p>

<p>
	It wouldn't be real progress if it could be falsified so easily.
</p>

<p>
	That is like saying, if I learn math while on birth control, after I go off birth control will the math still work?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's right, you lack a reference experience for what the label "Absolute Love" is pointing to.
</p>

<p>
	That is okay. I only discovered this reference experience a few years ago at around age 31.
</p>

<p>
	It cannot be gotten in your current state of consciousness. You need a radical change in state. Psychedelics are your best bet.
</p>

<p>
	Next time you trip, set your intention to realize what Absolute Love is. At the beginning of your trip tell yourself, "Okay, now show me Absolute Love! What is Love? I am ready to know." If you set a firm intention and you really want to know, it will be shown to you. Mushrooms, LSD, DMT, 5-MeO, 2C-B, MDMA, etc can all show you this love. But you may have to purify yourself first before it is shown to you. You must be ready to surrender the ego to see it, since it is totally selfless.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to know, it will be shown to you. No doubt about it. It's not a matter of random luck. So keep your intention strong. Put your heart into it.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds to me that you're close to realizing it. A few more deep trips might do the trick.
</p>

			So what you are saying here is that there is no ‘why’ that can be expressed with words? But how can it then be understood as a concept? Can this question be answered verbally? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, it can definitely be expressed with words -- but -- those words will ring hollow to anyone who hasn't had the direct realization. Words only have meaning to you when they have a corresponding reference experience. The word "apple" means nothing to you unless you've tasted an actual apple first. Then the word becomes useful. So it's like I'm talking about apples to you but you've never even seen an apple. So to you the word is empty.
</p>

<p>
	It CAN be understood as a concept, but the concept of it is not the thing itself. I have explained the purpose of ego and life many times in my videos as a concept. But what good does it do you? Not much, because you need to discover the truth of what I say for yourself. Then my words will have some significance to you.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it can be answered verbally, but it's weak compared to the non-verbal realization. Here's your verbal answer:
</p>

<p>
	What is the purpose of ego? Survival
</p>

<p>
	What is the purpose of life? To experience yourself as God
</p>

<p>
	Why does anything exist at all? Absolute Infinity
</p>

<p>
	Remember that words are pointers. Pointers to direct experiences. So you must discover what the pointers are pointing to.
</p>

How can I understand deeper what and how Yellow emotional operation system works?
		</p>

		<p>
			How one can examine his emotional stage of development? I mean, I thought that Green and Orange are feeling the same emotions but for different reasons.
		</p>

		<p>
			Of course, we can distinguish, for example, Green from others by presence of such emotions like empathy and love to himself, but at the same time I think Orange also can feel the same but for another reasons and through another “medium”. While Green can hug and cry with you, Orange will pitch you to his boss or take you to the bar. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Is what you talking about when saying “emotional development” are differences in the ways of expression?
		</p>

		<p>
			Or you talking about emotional awareness and understanding of the most suitable ways of expressing them?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not that Orange or even Red can't feel love or empathy. They can. The issue is the level of sophistication these emotions, the level of self-awareness, their depth, and their extent.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Red and Orange will feel love, but that love will be very limited -- their circle of concern does not extend very far. It only applies to their family, close friends, and their nation. And even so, selfishness will limit that love even within family. Red and Orange will also treat love as "merely an emotion". Their love will not have an existential aspect. Their love will not be universal. They will not understand how deep love goes or the power of love. They will deny that love is an Absolute or a property of the universe. They will value money and sex over love. They will mistake love with sexual desire or material possession. They will be so stuck in their left-brain that they will think that logic is superior to love. Their hearts will be closed. They will not have a "Teotlized heart". Whereas a Green person will understand the importance of love more. The Green person has some opening of the heart. But Green still does not comprehend love as an Absolute. Green still does not understand what love is. Green's love is still not fully universal. Green loves to hate Blue & Orange. Whereas at Turquoise love becomes an Absolute -- finally, it becomes totally universal. Finally the constant judgment and criticism and hatred are purified in the light of consciousness. Love is no longer something you do, it's something you ARE. Now you have a Teotlized heart which embraces all of Creation. At this point, your love is so great you are incapable of seeing evil, enemies, or wrongdoing. All sense of "other" starts to disappear. Everywhere you look you only see your Self, you only see Goodness, you only see Love. Your love becomes not about having or receiving but about giving. You love while simultaneously being detached from the objects of your love. Your capacity to love increases exponentially and the depth of your love goes through the roof. Your love becomes unconstrained by ego.
</p>

<p>
	This is not just about feeling an emotion. This is about changing your entire attitude towards and understanding of reality. As you understand reality deeper (at higher Spiral stages) your emotions will change. How you see the world affects what your emotions are doing because emotions reflect your needs and values. As you move up the Spiral your needs and values change.
</p>

<p>
	Practicing unconditional love is a great way to develop emotionally no matter what stage of the Spiral you're at. You can always love a lot more, a lot deeper. So when it doubt, love more! This one approach can transform your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional development is probably the most important of all developmental lines. Because emotions dictate your whole life. Emotions are more powerful than cognition. Which is why all advertising, marketing, and politics is played at the level of emotion. To get someone to do something you must trigger them emotionally. Logic is cheap.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is a real thing (as real as anything else is). The point is that it's possible to become so conscious that you stop doing it.
</p>

<p>
	Think of suffering like biting your nails. It is real when you're doing it. But you can also stop doing it. The point of consciousness work is to become aware of how and why you're doing dysfunctional unconscious stuff, like getting angry, or judging, or overeating, or suffering. We are making unconscious habits conscious, thereby giving us freedom from doing them automatically.

You need to hit a new state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation, yoga, or psychedelics are needed. The answer is experiential, not verbal or rational.
</p>

<p>
	When you really discover why it all exists, it blows your whole heart open. It takes your breath away. It is a religious conversion experience. It is not even in the same ballpark as a verbal answer.

	There is far more to this work than one enlightenment.

<p>
	Neo-Adavaita is dangerously oversimplified. You are never going to master consciousness through something like Neo-advaita.
</p>

<p>
	To master consciousness will take you tens of thousands of hours. Not just 1000. Some of you guys keep not understanding this.

	A brain happens within consciousness. Consciousness does not happen in a brain.

<p>
	You are stuck in the materialist paradigm and it will totally block you from enlightenment unless you completely deconstruct it and drop it like a fairytale.

</p>

<p>
	With that said, therapy is still useful. But it won't work for you if you're short on cash. Effective therapy requires lots of sessions and will be very costly.
</p>

<p>
	Session per session psychedelics will grow you 10x to 100x faster than therapy. Talking about psychological matters is nowhere as effective as direct spiritual consciousness. Talk therapy is notoriously slow.

It is a compound thing which includes several components: 1) a raw sensation, 2) an automatic bodily recoil reaction, 3) a conceptual activity of interpretation, assignment of meaning, and judgment, and 4) an emotional reaction.
</p>

<p>
	So what Ramana is referring to is #3 & #4, which are of course conceptual activity which can be stopped. The raw sensation is still there. But once you eliminate #3 & #4, this thing we call pain starts to feel and look very different from pain. The sting of pain is not in the raw sensation but in our conceptual interpretation and emotional reaction to it.
</p>

<p>
	So there's no contradiction between what Ramana says and what I am saying. He's just stating it a bit simplistically and starkly so that you realize the important lesson: your mind plays a huge part in how you experience pain.
</p>

<p>
	Have you ever had an experience of pain so intense you start to enjoy it? If you get really curious about pain as it is happening, the sting of it lessens. In that moment you are experiencing it purely as #1, a raw sensation.
</p>

<p>
	Also notice that most pain is not physical but emotional in nature. When someone breaks your heart, or when you feel sad or lonely, none of that is physical pain. It's conceptually driven. And even if you break your leg, at least half your pain will come from the story you tell yourself about it, "OH MY GOD! Why did this happen to me? When will I be able to walk again? What if my boss fires me? How much is this gonna cost me to fix? How could I have been so foolish? Why can't it just stop?" etc.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, videos are in the works. It's just taken me some time to integrate my retreat experiences and figure out how to live life from a higher altitude. I have to change how I do my work. So I'm sorting that out.

</p>

<p>
	When the physical world is stripped of all concept and interpretation what remains is Absolute Being. At that point the world stops being "physical" and it becomes divine and eternal.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Always try the direct route first. Sit down and simply ask yourself, "What is my trauma?"
</p>

<p>
	If your intention is genuine and honest, and you are open, your mind should supply you the answers.
</p>

<p>
	If that fails, do it while on a psychedelic and you will almost surely receive your answers. Just be careful what you wish for.
</p>

<p>
	The whole problem with heavily traumatic people is that they are not genuine, honest, or open. They have no intention of facing their trauma. They don't want know the truth because it is too painful. They actively avoid talking or thinking about it. So in such cases therapy or psychedelics are very useful. But even so, if there is no intention at all to honestly introspect, nothing will help. The person has to want to grow.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind usually gives you what you ask of it. Most people don't ask much so they don't get much.
</p>

<p>
	All the answers to your life challenges lie within you. But you must dig them out.
</p>

Awakening will be filtered through the mind and personality no matter how awake you get. Some people are more sentimental and emotional while other people are more autistic, cool, and dispassionate.
</p>

<p>
	One awakened person could emphasize Nothingness in his teaching. Another awakened person could emphasize Love in his teaching. Etc. Which is why an integral approach is so good. You can get the best of all the teachings and teachers.

<p>
	Another way to phrase it is: put your attention on attention itself. What is pure attention devoid of all content?
</p>

<p>
	Try doing that for a bit and see how it feels. Notice it's really hard to keep your attention there. The attention veers off within seconds onto some form. This kind of meditation requires serious concentration ability which most people do not have in today's media-saturated culture.
</p>

<p>
	You need to be able to concentrate so hard you could burn a hole through brick wall with your focus. This is the key to accessing the deepest levels of spirituality.

<p>
	What he's saying has value, especially for newbie and intermediate students.
</p>

<p>
	But at the same time, suffering IS a conceptual activity and it can be transcended or stopped. It is something you are doing and you can stop doing it. This does mean that you stop feeling, just the opposite, you must feel it fully, with total consciousness. That total consciousness is what allows you to experience the suffering as self-constructed activity, at which point it becomes conscious and it ceases to be suffering.
</p>

<p>
	This requires very high levels of consciousness which even most awakened people in the West do not have.
</p>

<p>
	But the most advanced practitioners develop it. Which is how monks can do self-immolation.
</p>

<p>
	So the deconstruction of suffering is not merely marketing. It's just unattainable for most people because this requires super-human levels of consciousness which only the most hardcore practitioners will attain.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is, by trying to end suffering you end up creating suffering. So that's not a good attitude in this work. Trying to always be in a positive state is not going to work well. If you really want to end suffering you must completely stop caring what state you're in, even if you're getting tortured, you have to be okay with that state. It's REALLY hard to be that conscious. But it can be done. Just don't go chasing it.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I have not vaped it. Because after I snorted 30mg the trip was so intense it felt traumatizing and physically harmful. So I'm not eager to go any more intense than that.
</p>

<p>
	The intensity I get from plugging is so powerful I don't need any more intensity. And if I did, I could always up the plugged dose.
</p>

<p>
	Properly vaporizing a dose can also be challenging. Vaporizing HCl can be tricky as it burns. It also smells gross and I'm not sure if it's healthy for the lungs.

<p>
	You must understand that people have their own partial perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	Martin has some good ideas, but they are partial. He has never plugged 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	My 5-MeO experiences are different from what Martin describes in his books. People react to these substances in unique ways. I am not against vaping. I've just resonated with the plugging. Sometimes you find something that's so good it is perfect, requiring nothing more. That's where I'm at with plugged 5-MeO. To me, it is perfect. It is just absolutely perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Try various methods and see which you like most. Don't turn this into an ideological battle.

<p>
	Falsehood does not exist. There is only truth.
</p>

<p>
	What you call falsehood is an idea which exists in your mind. You're confused about what it is. You're confusing ideas for reality, which makes falsehood seem like it exists when actually it does not.
</p>

<p>
	I dare you to take your finger and point to one false thing in the world. Notice, it cannot be done. Anything you point to, is true. If it isn't true, it isn't a thing so you cannot point to it.
</p>

<p>
	If you point to a picture of a unicorn thinking that's false, you're wrong. It's true. It's just a drawing of a unicorn. That's what it IS. That's its truth. The mistake is imagining further that this unicorn is supposed to exist as something other than the drawing that it is. See? You get lost in your imagination. That's the whole problem here. Falsehood seems to exist only when your imagination is active. You must imagine falsehood. But even imagination is true. You just need to be aware that it is imagination and not the physical world. People conflate those two very easily because it helps us survive.
</p>

<p>
	Falsehood is like a magic trick. It's a clever illusion. An impossibility that appears to be possible when you're not looking at it closely enough.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to stay conscious that all "other" is really yourself. Even if the other is harsh.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise you're in duality.
</p>

<p>
	So I would practice integrating that experience in a way where you're not separating yourself from whoever/whatever that thing was. Then maybe next time it won't feel so "other" or foreign.
</p>

<p>
	If plugged DMT works similar to plugged 5-MeO, it will be an amazing ROA. My best guess is that plugging DMT is better than vaporizing it. Most people vaporize simply because they have not been shown a better way. And because most DMT is sold as freebase. I'll try out both methods and let you guys know my results.
