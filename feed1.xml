	I got far better things to do. I would much rather teach those who are opeminded. You cannot awake a fool.

			I know but it's not really about the money really, it's about helping humanity awaken. I am 100 percent sure that if science could prove psychic abilities under the influence of 5-MEO-DMT that it would lead to many people on the path of psychedelics and 5-MEO-DMT. Just think about how much suffering you could end in doing this. That is a noble respectable challenge.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	When you are that woke, there is no one to help awaken. There is only you, and you are fully awake and perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Science cannot prove paranormal abilities because science is paradigm locked, not because the proof is lacking. Science is in denial about the proof. So the problem is in the scientists minds.
</p>

<p>
	Paranormal abilities have been proven statistically beyond any doubt. But a materialist cannot accept it. You can't prove a thing to a person who insists on denying its possibility.

	When I am that conscious, the notion of money makes no sense. Money is a joke when you are God-woken.

<p>
	You have to appreciate that many people who get into psychedelics are deeply dysfunctional misfits who have a ton of trauma and shadow issues. This creates a warped sample. That's why there are so many bad trip reports and little enlightenment.

	JP does say intelligent and insightful things. I've gleaned insights from him. It's just that his worldview is quite twisted up by his ego and shadow. You have to be very selective and not fall for his right-wing meta-narratives. But some of his psychology lectures are good.

	There's no single solution here for everyone. You must find whatever you're comfortable with and capable of handling. For some people this will mean tons of sex, for others it will mean the opposite, because you are on different karmic paths.

</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics could really help with that, guiding your towards a deeper self-acceptance and forgiveness. Especially MDMA therapy.
</p>

<p>
	It's a shame to see you suffering for years with that stuff unnecessarily when the tools for healing exist. You can heal yourself in a few years of work and live a happy life.

<p>
	It's not the drug, it's how you use it. I feel like many people trip but don't seriously contemplate because they are not contemplative people by nature.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind, maybe mahasamadhi ain't real. I don't know for sure. I am just reporting my preliminary research.

<p>
	I don't know. I lack expertise in such things. My primary focus is not on superpowers but understanding consciousness. Any superpowers I discover will be side-effects of my search for understanding.
</p>

<p>
	You are talking about cultivating classic yogic siddhis. If you're serious about that, you probably want some serious yogic practice. But also be careful chasing such things. I would focus on awakening and liberation.

<p>
	Huh? Your question makes no sense to me.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck experiencing what 5-MeO-DMT shows you without 5-MeO-DMT. You will try and try, but you will fail and fail.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Oh, I get your question.
</p>

<p>
	So the reason I had to force myself is because I'm still integrating the insight/experience from the previous day and doing another trip so soon feels premature and overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
	Again, I don't do psychedelics for pleasure. Yeah, if pleasure was the reason I was doing it, I'd be doing 5-MeO-DMT every day of the year. But that would be a harmful addiction.
</p>

<p>
	You shouldn't use psychedelics for being in a pleasant mood or state. That option has never even cross my mind until you just brought it up to me now. I went for 3 years without seriously considering doing that because it would be such a foolish move.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful getting hooked on positive moods and feelings.
</p>

<p>
	While I love the idea of being the first and greatest, I have read reports of a Western guy who attained mahasamadhi from LSD. He was actually meditating in a cave, did a bunch of LSD, and simply left his body for good.
</p>

<p>
	A guru in India later verified that the dude left his body and didn't simply die by suicide or overdose.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe the stories that is.
</p>

<p>
	Some interesting food for thought.
</p>

<p>
	I am certainly nowhere near that level of consciousness without 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	I also wouldn't call what I experienced as a rainbow body. I would call it becoming an infinite singularity of love forever. It is totally formless consciousness. Like becoming pure potential with no actualization.
</p>

			Leo, have you watched Steven Greer’s new Movie Close Encounters of the fifth Kind? That movie is all about consciousness and how we can communicate with E.T beings through it. As you are someone with a high baseline level of consciousness I’d love to see you give the protocols a try, maybe even go on A expedition with Greer? Radical open mindedness and all that. What do you say?

<p>
	I've watched some of his older stuff. Not sure about the newest one. Not sure what to make of it, honestly. On the one hand it seems convincing, on the other hand it's also very conspiratorial and us vs them.
</p>

<p>
	As soon as I see people framing reality or society as us vs them, I get turned off because I know it isn't the highest truth. It's the ego projecting its fears and blaming some "elites" which I don't buy.

	No one is in control.

</blockquote>

<p>
	If you were conscious enough to be telepathic you wouldn't care about downloading PhD programs and you'd probably realize your brain is imaginary too.
</p>

<p>
	What people misunderstand about these supernatural abilities is that they cannot be co-opted and made to serve the ego's petty selfish desires. These powers arise out of a deep selfless consciousness which isn't so much concerned with how to manifest money or prove itself to closedminded materialist scientists, etc. It's got bigger fish to fry.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I don't have telepathic abilities in my normal state. It was a function of lots of 5-MeO-DMT. I have not cultivated it as an ability. It was just a preview of what is possible with training.

	Ralston is saying there's no difference or it doesn't matter. And in a sense he is right. Wherever you go, there you are. God is in all places at once. I agree with that.

	There is no this or that with 5-MeO-DMT. There is only oneness.
</p>

<p>
	No, with mahasamadhi they are not merely saying a person dies, they are saying that consciousness has become so unbiased and infinite that it surrenders the formed material dream. This is not the same as ordinary death and it can be done on command, at will. How can you know? By doing it! Lol. Many examples are documented.

<p>
	We were talking about the relative domain of animals and human separation. Now you switch to Absolute as your trump card.
</p>

<p>
	The point was that animals and humans are not so different. Being an animal is not easy like how you made it sound. You are welcome to act like an animal at any time and see how easy or hard that life is. You don't act like an animal precisely because it's easier to be civilized.

<p>
	Nature isn't at rest. Nature is constantly in a brutal fight for survival. You think being a human is a curse? How about being a gazelle chased by lions your whole life? You can't call the police on a lion.
</p>

<p>
	Humans came from animals. There is a direct line from an oak to your ego. It's all just different layers of survival. More and more sophisticated survival.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason nature looks at rest is because you ain't knee deep in it, running away from a lion.

<p>
	There is a deeper level than this because your Absolute is now separate from the relative, from the form, from the change. But the Absolute is not merely formless, it is also identical to form, relativity, and change.
</p>

<p>
	Form IS myself. It makes no sense to differential form from formless. I am ONE, not two. Everything that changes is me.

			I would be cautious with Ralston's claim and clarify what "knowing" you're everything all the time means. As he sais chapter 9 of genius of being you can't survive within "no context". So he goes on to say that you can create a new context for experience that is inclusive of the understanding retained from the awakening. Sounds like what embodiment is about to me, and not "direct experience all the time".

			It just sounds like you say the Absolute is a state, which it isn’t. It is present in all states. It is the container of all states. It is the unchanging and unrelative.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, language starts to break down at this level. You could call it a state or all possible states. Depends on how you define state and other terms in your worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the Absolute is all there is, but most people aren't conscious of the fact that their experience is Absolute. To be conscious that your experience is the Absolute you must be in the proper state which allows you to recognize it as such. If you're not in this case, the Absolute is still here, but you don't know it as such, and therefore you ain't awake.
</p>

<p>
	It's not quite right to say that the Absolute is unchanging because it's also changing all the time. If the Absolute is unchanging, then what is changing? Something other than the Absolute? That is absurd. So Absolute can't be separate from change.

			Do you mean the insight that you are to powerful and alone, everything is you, thats the reason why you created the ego, because of purpose of duality is satisfaction and love. God loves to see its duality to satisfy itself that it is not alone.  Love is the bridge between duality to non duality. Thats why all is one, because both sides complete each other. If god side never realize duality, It will never be understand that it is god. Thats why we created ourselves as a human now. God must create something separate from it in order to be a god, because in non duality everything is god. Such as , if cold is not exist warm can never be exist, if evil not exist goodnesses can never be exist. Thats the reason why many people must not know about they are God, because if everyone knows this knowledge it can never be duality. Because of that evil must be exist in entire civilization? Lol these were all the insights i got as a god on shrooms.

<p>
	It took me many trips to get those insights. I got no insights in my first trip.

<p>
	This has been well reported over the last few years. It's also obvious from the fact that he cannot even sit through a 5 page briefing. Not only does he not read books, he doesn't even read his presidential daily briefing reports. His advisors are told to dumb everything down with big pictures because he doesn't read words! He refuses to read past the first page or two of anything.

	Careful with the judging.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are simple folk and they need someone near their level. Hard to blame them for that, or even JP for appealing to them. They're at where they're at. Would you rebuke a 2nd grader for being in 2nd grade? Or the teacher teaching 2nd grade? Someone's gotta do it.

	But be careful that in making your million you don't sell your soul to the devil.
</p>

<p>
	It's relatively easy to make a million.

<p>
	It's much harder to do it without resorting to devilry.

<p>
	This will vary a lot from person to person.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all practice helps. So it's a good idea to try it and maybe do some visualization exercises to program that into your mind.
</p>

<p>
	But ultimately the trip itself will do most of the work. Literally all you gotta do is trust it and let go and let it show you God. That's it! It will show you exactly what you need next to reach towards God. Sometime that will be God itself. But often times it will first show you psychological baggage which is holding you back from facing God directly.

	Actually I would caution against this for you. Shamans are known to give huge doses, they make you vape it, and the toad venom isn't gonna have a consistent potency because no two toads are the same.

<p>
	The safest way to take 5-MeO-DMT is synthetic, and plugged up your butt.

	I have no idea about him. But if he is a human form, he's still limited. If he is in Nepal, isn't also in Japan. Thus limited.

<p>
	Again, I'm no doctor so I can't tell you what is safe for you.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, the biggest factor is not the chemical itself but how you choose to react to it, which no one can predict. If you start freaking out, that can certainly cause some physical stress. But in my experience most psychedelics do not have a significant effect on the heart or blood. I don't feel my body getting taxed by them. The mind yes, the body not so much. But maybe that's just me. I tend to surrender to psychedelics very easily. So I rarely have issues.

I will check out 5 meo dmt again. I take blood thinner medication (warfarin, if warfarin level goes high i can have internal bleeding or low can have stroke, because i have a mechanical valve). I used shrooms because they are natural (Normal mushrooms, just includes psilocybin) . Additionally, i spoke with a clinic, which is located at Vancouver/Canada, they told me 5 meo dmt could be dangerous for me and advice either lsd or shrooms. Thats the reason why i have done the shrooms as 10 gr. Thanks a lot for the advice.  But I really want to do 5 meo dmt. I will deeply search it again.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, be cautious. I am not responsible for your health or death.
</p>

<p>
	But the nice thing with 5-MeO-DMT is that you can plug a tiny amount of it and just feel minor effects and slowly ramp up from there. So you should be able to gently inch your way up very carefully and feel if there is any blood pressure problems or heart problems. You can even measure your blood pressure while you're on it.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT makes my body feel good. It actually temporarily frees me of all my health problems. You just have to learn to surrender to it and then it feels amazing. The come-up only lasts from 5 mins to 15 mins. After the 15 min mark you will be tripping hard but the bodily stuff is behind you. Of course this assumes you surrender to it. If you resist it, oh boy... that might be hell. I'm too scared to dare resisting 5-MeO-DMT. Once that thing is in you, you better surrender immediately.
</p>

<p>
	I can foresee some serious heart issues if your dose goes 30mg+. That's when your consciousness will become so infinite that your heart will melt and explode out your chess in Love. There will be kundalini activation and all sorts of crazy shit can happen. But I never go that far. I keep my dose to 25mg max. Which is still crazy strong for me.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I claim that mahasamadhi may be possible. But that means you leave material existence forever. At least until you decide to start the whole cycle over again.
</p>

<p>
	It's pretty simple really: we can all agree there is only ONE being in the universe: God. This being can know it is God, or not know it. If it knows it, it's awake at least to some degree. If it doesn't know it, then it's clearly not in parinibbana. So clearly parinibbana cannot be a final resting.

			I think the entire point that Ralston's making is simply: do not confuse <em>this</em> state or <em>that</em> state with the "fact" that reality <em>is</em> states. One particular state is not enlightenment. Enlightenment is realizing reality is states, or you could say getting stuck in relativity vs realizing the absoluteness of relativity. I'm sure you're already aware of this, and also my formulation makes it look binary and simple. But it's to underline what I think the disagreement is

<p>
	Except my claim is that awakening IS a state. Some states of consciousness are awake and other aren't.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I disagree. Satori is a state and you can only achieve it precisely because you lost it to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	If satori was truly permanent, you could not have been born as a human ego. The whole point is that God can lose consciousness of itself. In fact, that's mostly what it's busy doing.
</p>

<p>
	You can argue that you never lost it, that you've always been awake. But to me this is silly. You were not born God-realized. Of course you were not born at all, but nevertheless, you believed for most of your life that you were born. Thus you were asleep. If you were asleep, then you weren't awake. And if you weren't awake, then whatever "permanent" satori you get in this life, you will lose at some point.
</p>

<p>
	God forgets itself, God remembers itself. This cycle has no beginning or end.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason there are unenlightened beings is because some enlightened being lost his permanent state of enlightenment.

You might have made incorrect conclusions about what is achievable without psychedelics, from your lack of achievements without them.

<p>
	Yes, I don't dispute this at all. By all means pursue a stable 24/7 satori. I am.

<p>
	Like I said in my Outrageous video, it's not about me being more woke than others. It's about reaching the highest understanding of reality. If you don't question the wokeness levels of your teachers you will simply never reach the highest levels of understanding possible. You will settle for less.
</p>

<p>
	My concern is understanding/consciousness, not comparing myself to other teachers. The comparison is only there in order to show you that there is a deeper level possible, not to put myself above others. Ralston is very masterful, much more so than I. So I don't hold him as some inferior person. I respect him a lot and value his work. But what he says about 5-MeO-DMT is simply incorrect. And you can easily verify it for yourself. 5-MeO-DMT will give you a deeper awakening than you will ever get at one of his workshops or enlightenment intensives. This much I would bet $100,000 on. With that said, I still enjoy his workshops. He has a lot to offer. But you won't understand most of it until you do 5-MeO-DMT.

<title>Methods for becoming a millionaire</title>

I actually had a number of doctors with me in residency training who we're working in Burger king and delivering pizza while going through pre-med and medical school. One of those doctors who was in training with me, used to work in fast food chains cleaning tables, she's now a successful family doctor in her early 30s, happily owns her dream house in the countryside, has wisely paid off a significant amount of her student loans and is on the track to become a millionaire! I've personally met many doctors who used to work minimum wage jobs to get themselves through college. Another doctor I met was a Biology teacher getting paid slave wage as a schoolteacher, who decided to go through medical school in his late 40s and become a doctor. He's now making 10x what he made as a teacher and added another 0 to his annual income.
		</p>

		<p>
			All these doctors from various backgrounds proved to me that one can become a doctor regardless of what minimum wage job they're currently working.
		</p>

		<p>
			P.S. I love you soo much 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Fair enough. I guess if you really want it you can do it.
</p>

<p>
	But it strikes me as odd that someone would become a doctor in order to become wealthy. There are easier ways. Being a doctor should be a career of passion, something you're really drawn towards naturally, otherwise I don't know how you'll keep that up. Business is more flexible. You can start many kinds of different businesses. Being a doctor is a very specific career for a very specific kind of person.
</p>

<p>
	But of course it's possible to become a millionaire simply by getting a six-figure high-skill career. I guess I'm biased towards business because then your earning potential is unlimited. It's hard to earn $10 mil as even a great doctor. But it's relatively easy in business.

<p>
	That may be wise. I'm no doctor.
</p>

<p>
	But also, once you get used to 5-MeO-DMT, it doesn't really put pressure on the heart. The heart pressure and blood pressure will naturally rise if you are freaked out over ego-death. But if you surrender calmly, nothing should rise. The 5-MeO-DMT is challenging mentally, not so much physically. At least when plugged.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, in your case it might be too dangerous. Then again, you say you did 10g shrooms so...
</p>

<p>
	I would be more scared of 10g shrooms than 5-MeO-DMT. I find shrooms to be one of the most challenging substances aside from salvia.
</p>

<p>
	I definitely caution you guys to be careful with 5-MeO-DMT. I am very careful with it, and even so, I've had some challenging times. Exploring consciousness can be dangerous activity. Then again, Peter Ralston has jumped off roof-tops in his youth and fought in deadly tournaments -- so he's not exactly above dangerous things. I think martial arts is more dangerous than moderately dosed psychedelics.

</p>

<p>
	Doctors and lawyers make that much because they invested 8 years in expensive schools and have a ton of student debt to pay off for a decade.
</p>

<p>
	The statistics on anyone becoming a millionaire are gonna be low, by definition, because millionaires must be rare in society. When you say you want to become a millionaire you are automatically shooting for the top 2-3% of society. Yeah, that's gonna have a high failure rate because you gotta out-compete the other 98%.
</p>

<p>
	But it's not a matter of luck, it's a matter of working smart and really really wanting it. If you really really want it, you can do it. The problem is most people don't want it bad enough. They aren't willing to work for it. The failure rate is so high because most people who attempt it are just bullshitters. They aren't serious.

Why on earth would you ask a Zen master to tell you that you're God? This such an absurd move that you will laugh when you realize what you're doing.

<p>
	Shrooms are a very twisted experience. 5-MeO-DMT is much clearer and more of a pure satori. Shrooms don't give a pure satori. They mix it with a lot of mind stuff, shadow stuff, fantasy, imagination, etc. At 10 grams, mushrooms are basically madness. So that's not a good reference point for judging something like 5-MeO-DMT or other psychedelics. Mushrooms are the most twisted short of salvia.

<p>
	Lol, that's precisely what I mean. You were able to give it up precisely because you burned through that karma. You satiated that desire to the point where now you can transcend it. This is what I said above is the most realistic way.
</p>

<p>
	Now imagine what would have happened had you spent decades suppressing it and trying to act saintly.
</p>

<p>
	Growing up requires living through experiences. It's not enough to just theoretically let stuff go. Experience, struggle, and failure are necessary to learn the deepest lessons. Which is why we have life in the first place.

</blockquote>

<p>
	If you take enough 5-MeO-DMT you will get infinite satori. Satori with no bottom. Deeper than every Zen master who has ever lived combined.
</p>

<p>
	Satori just means God-realization. But there are many degrees of God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	You can read Zen books like Three Pillars of Zen to get a sense of how words like satori or kensho are used by Zen masters. You will also find that Zen masters have various levels of satori. For example, I don't doubt that Shinzen Young has some degree of satori, but he don't understand Infinity/God to my satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to get a mild satori. It's much harder to gain complete God-realization and the omniscience that comes with it.

<p>
	There is no escaping states of consciousness. Consciousness is always in some state, whether you are enlightened or not, or even if you are dead.
</p>

<p>
	So saying something is "a state" is silly, because EVERYTHING is a state. Calling a thing a state doesn't say anything.
</p>

<p>
	Satori is a state. Which is why psychedelics can induce satori. How long it lasts is irrelevant. Anyone can easily test that psychedelics induce satori and awakening. This is foolish to argue about. Test it. All my claims are empirical and verifiable.
</p>

<p>
	But it is also good that you guys are confused and don't know who to believe. That forces you to test both Peter and me and do the work to verify what is true. Now you are forced to really investigate this matter and think deeply about it. Perhaps both of us are wrong and you will find even some higher truth.
</p>

<p>
	Disagreement between advanced teachers is one of the best things for a student. It forces you to ask how such a thing is possible. If enlightenment was so simple, how come there is so much disagreement??? Hmmmm...... could that be a clue?
</p>

<p>
	The question is, to what degree?
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT can give you a such a satori that you will not even be able to walk around.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is stable and functional doesn't make it the highest.

<p>
	Most people are not simply gonna be able to drop sex, no matter your logic or numbers. The better strategy is to satiate the sex drive rather than repress it. If you can genuinely drop it, great. But that's so rare it makes you a unique person.
</p>

<p>
	This is a topic where it helps to be realistic rather than saintly. That saintliness will come back to bite you if you aren't fully able to embody it naturally. Saintliness through repression will not work.

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is not a subjective state. 5-MeO-DMT goes beyond traditional enlightenment to levels of awakening that no ordinary human is capable of. Awakening has many degrees and omniscience is possible.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Peter and I have some important disagreements.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that the people who do Peter's workshops and retreats... I would not consider a single one of them truly awake. Neither is his apprentice -- who I'm good friends with. It's all good stuff, but it's not even 1% close to the awakenings I've experienced.

	I don't want to rain on your plans, but once you have a 5-MeO breakthrough, all the other stuff you do on retreat will become pointless.
</p>

<p>
	You will never meditate your way to what 5-MeO will show you. Not in 30 years.

<p>
	Only if that's what you're imagining from a certain human state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, reality doesn't know you threw water in my face unless you imagine you did.

<title>On Leo's Perspective On Conspiracy Theories</title>

<p>
	The problem is that you have to draw the line somewhere for pragmatic reasons. If you spend your time chasing down ever rumor found on the internets, you'll be doing that for 1,000 years and never awaken.
</p>

<p>
	So you must balance between openmindedness but also practicality. You have limited time and energy and focus. You must be highly strategic. Distraction is a tactic of devilry. The devil would love nothing more than to have you chasing down every conspiracy theory.
</p>

<p>
	Have you noticed that the most awake people do not talk about conspiracy theories? Why do you think that is?
</p>

<p>
	Don't discuss low level bullshit in a Zen temple.
</p>

<p>
	We are not going to wasting our time here talking about 9/11 inside job bullshit. And if 9/11 really was an inside job? Oh well, we got bigger fish to fry. My job here is to keep you guys on track rather than devolving into the Alex Jones show. If you really want to explore conspiracy theories, go ahead, just do it elsewhere. I feel no obligation to provide you a platform for that.
</p>

Keep in mind that I was only able do 30 days because I had enormous prior preperation. And even so, it waa very challenging towards the end.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to traumatize yourself. You must take it slow and stop if you start getting in over your head. It's easy to get in over your head.

			How much of this do you think is the limitation of the human mind? Could there be a mind structure that was geared towards operating in this "deeper" realm of "causes" or magic while our human minds are not structured to do this or to grapple with it effectively?
		</p>

		<p>
			Could there be a being that could use these deeper realms to construct a sort of language out of it, if it's mind was geared towards doing so? Could there be a mind that was geared solely towards the exploration of the "Inner" realms? And what would that mean in relationship to our inherent limitations as human minds?

<p>
	You are right, there are higher level of mind at which the mind can still think/reason about reality and understand it at much deeper levels than any human can.
</p>

<p>
	That's precisely what psychedelics offer. They give you super-mind. You can reason and think in ways far beyond the conventional human mind. It's like having the mind of a super-intelligence alien.
</p>

<p>
	But there is something even beyond super-mind, which is Infinite Consciousness or Omniscience or Being.

			I’m not even saying there’s a physical universe. I’m saying there’s a dream going in here, that follows a cause and effect chain. This is how as you said in the pm’s you can at the moment of awakening look back at your life and see how every single micro-event has led up to this exact moment. And that’s just in the appearance of it. There is really just one timeless non-event.
		</p>

		<p>
			So you are denying the appearance of cause and effect?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Cause & effect is dualistic. It is an illusion and the casual chains are infinitely long, with not beginning or end. And they run in circles and strange loops.
