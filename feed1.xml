There is no you! The you who thinks it is reading this sentence does not exist. You are a fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is happening without you. The idea of "a you" is being attached to that reality to create the illusion that it is happening to "a you".
</p>

<p>
	For a minute right now, try to totally eliminate any sense that reality is here for you, or is in any way related to your body. Eliminate the sense of yourself entiry. Look at the room you're in an imagine you were never born, but the room still exists exactly as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Eliminate every ounce of you-ness from experience. If you are still saying the words, "me", "I", or "my" you still aren't getting it. Those words refer to nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Or just take a psychedelic and it will be so obvious. Stop wasting time on ineffective methods. Psychedelics answer all questions.

	You are inside a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	You are busy trying to accomplish things in this hallucination without realizing its a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	The mind spins this hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	You would be far more effective if you realized you're in a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	Think Neo in The Matrix vs some fool slaving away in a cubical like Elon Musk. Musk is great at being the busiest rat in the maze hunting for cheese. Is that what you want to be?

	There are no sides. There are scientific projections which predict 1-10 ft of sea level rise which will leave millions homeless, or there is propaganda paid for by corporations with vested interest in denying such studies.

	"Illusion", "reality", "existence", "God" are themselves categories.

<p>
	It all collapses into Absolute Oneness. Within this Oneness nothing can be distinguished. It is pure undifferentiation. It contains all things. Like how white light contains all possible colors of light.

</p>

<p>
	The situation is simple: Either there is Truth or there isn't. If there is Truth you want to know what this Truth is. Pursue the Truth regardless of whatever. Truth is Truth is Truth. If knowing the Truth is wrong then you shouldn't want continue living.
</p>

<p>
	Let nothing stand in the way between you and Truth. Period.
</p>

<p>
	Truth can only be found if it occupies #1 priority in your heart.
</p>

<p>
	What use if family if it means giving up Truth? Can you see that without Truth nothing else matters? Nothing matters if you cannot distinguish it from falsehood.

<p>
	A) Spirituality is full of traps no matter how you slice it.
</p>

<p>
	B) This problem is solved through studying diverse sources and having maps like the Zen ox-herding pictures and Spiral Dynamics.
</p>

<p>
	The greater danger with the way you are presenting enlightenment -- as total mastery -- is that people will always fall short of the fantasy, including yourself. Which then produces guilt and suffering. What you are really talking about is totally emotional mastery, and that is VERY different than enlightenment. It is significantly harder and a lot of people can become very frustrated chasing that.
</p>

<p>
	This sort of all-or-nothing approach is counter-productive and fills newbies with fantastical ideas of becoming perfect human beings after awakening. The fact is, you will awaken long before you become a perfect human being. Because these are independent variables.
</p>

<p>
	By all means pursue mastery. But make a distinction between it and awakening.
</p>

<p>
	If your definition of enlightenment excludes Ramana Maharshi, Shinzen Young, Osho, etc. you might want to rethink your definition.
</p>

<title>Pull From 100s of Diverse Sources</title>

<p>
	Firstly, many gurus are not at stage Yellow integral cognitive development.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, it is against the guru's business and marketing self-agenda to expose you to 100s of diverse sources. It is in his business interest to create a captive audience, a monopoly.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, exposure to 100s of diverse sources was almost impossible before the internet age. Be careful not to take this for granted. These days you guys are spoiled rotten with 100s of sources.

These are two very distinct things. By making this conflation, as you say, no one is enlightened, because your definition of enlightenment has become an idealistic fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	There are many lines and stages of human development alongside many states and degrees of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality can be grasped at many depths, it has multiple facets, and the realization of all those insights will not automatically make you a perfect human being.
</p>

<p>
	The way we use the terms enlightenment/awakening on this forum is to mean: the realization of no-self, God, Infinity, or Absolute Oneness. That life is a dream. This can happen and you can still have all sorts of fetters, bad behaviors, and psychological stuff. In fact, that's almost guaranteed.
</p>

<p>
	We do not use the word enlightenment to mean, "The total purifcation of karma and mind", or total mastery.
</p>

<p>
	Total mastery is a pipedream for most people and will take you 30+ years of industrial-grade practice.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment occurs when one catches the Ox. Not at picture #10.
</p>

<p>
	This is why the ox-herding pictures and Spiral Dynamics are so useful.
</p>

<title>Can Emotions Be &quot;Wrong&quot;?</title>

<p>
	The solution to emotions is to observe them mindfully. But of course this takes years of practice.
</p>

<p>
	There are also emotions of the higher self which pull you up to spiritual pursuits. But they are often drowned out by negative emotions like fear, anger, envy, greed, lust, etc.
</p>

	The distinction between self/other is a concept, and it will collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Leaving only one thing: YOU!
</p>

<p>
	Your mother is a concept. In fact, she is actually you. You came out of your own vagina.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this freaky to realize. It can feel like you're all alone. That's right! God is all alone. But do not confuse this with solipsism.

<p>
	Emotions are self-manipulations to maintain the self's survival agenda.

	Part of the problem with Green is getting lost in relativity: "everything's relative so anything goes. Let's let criminals run loose and do whatever they want."
</p>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	All POVs have some partial truth, BUT not all POV are equally functional. Some POVs are really pathological, dangerous, and limiting to upward mobility on the Spiral.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a more evolved and healthier POV than Orange, but Green still has its limits and problems.
</p>

<p>
	Your Orange friend is slightly more deluded than you. And it can be useful to point out his delusion to him.

<p>
	Remember that people below stage Green don't have much concern for environmental issues because their mind is preoccupied with more selfish things.
</p>

<p>
	So the root solution to climate change is to raise more people to Green cognitive development. Then, from that, the rest of the external solutions will follow.
</p>

<p>
	A Green populace will vote for green politicians and green energy.
</p>

<p>
	Climate change is really a problem of excessive Orange. As we can clearly see with Trump, who is in such denial about it.

<p>
	Let's start a list of the best music for listening to on psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously taste in music is very subjective, but try to post the best of the best here. This music should work well with psychedelics and tripping. Chill, moody, down-tempo, ambient, techno type stuff.
</p>

<p>
	There's lots of obscure psychedelic & chillout music that can be found on SoundCloud.

			The reason I say this is because of the "Dark night of the soul" thing. People talk about going through this stage for years. I can't do that. I've read about enlightenment a lot and almost everyone goes through years of hell to finally reach it and then a couple of years later go back to hell. I've already seen too much to go back, so what am I gonna do? live through this dark period until I give up on everything in my ego, including my loved ones?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The Dark Night does not usually last for years. That is rare. Many people don't even get a Dark Night.
</p>

<p>
	When the Dark Night lasts a long time that is for people who have no theoretical foundation, no good guidance.
</p>

<p>
	By watching my videos and reading the books you should be able to avoid all that.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Giving up your loved ones will be necessary regardless. All loved ones come and go. They do not last forever. Enlightenment requires you to surrender everything, but after that you come back and can appreciate it that much more.
</p>

<p>
	Detachment -- counter-intuitively -- heightens your capacity to love.
</p>

<title>Counintuitive Video Question - Rules = Freedom vs Trascendent Morality</title>

</p>

<p>
	Rules are important for a society to function, but also rules must be well selected and you must understand why the rule was created.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between following rules consciously vs unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
	And rules in society are much more appropirate than a rule-based personal morality. Your personal morality should not be rule-based but heart and consciousness centered.
</p>

A tiny taste.
</p>

<p>
	You only skimmed the surface of the ocean that is psychedelia.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplation will come naturally at deeper levels. You have to distinguish between contemplation which is artificial and contemplation which is organic. At higher doses you will be hit with organic contemplations without any need of writing down lists of questions.
</p>

<p>
	What's most important is just genuine curiosity about reality, not a list of questions. The list of questions is good to make, but you do that BEFORE the trip, and you don't look at it during the trip.
</p>

You gotta meet the person where they are at.
</p>

<p>
	Telling normies things like, "Nothing is real!" or "Who is saying that?" is just not skillful.

		<p>
			I agree with what you are pointing towards. The true self is all of reality, as it is right now. 
		</p>

		<p>
			OK Leo, but what do you mean by "creature" here? The idea that there exist external biological organisms which are centers for conscious experience is a concept which I cannot prove. You, Leo Gura, are appearing in my consciousness as a creature but I do not know that you are actually another conscious being. I am Leo Gura but I do not know if Leo Gura is conscious. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The falsehood of solipsism is a practical truth but when aiming for Enlightenment we want the person to stop conceptualising and abstracting all together. 
		</p>

		<p>
			To even say a statement like "you'll live forever" is extremely fuzzy verbal territory to root in actuality because implicit to that statement is notions of time when time is an illusion. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It does not make sense to you because you are not awake.
</p>

<p>
	If you woke up you'd immediately know that you are all creatures (and non-creatures) in the universe. This is not a theory or a conceptualization. It is the Absolute. But only if you awaken.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to become every creature to know this, you just need to wake up to what you are. To wake up is to become the entire universe and all objects in it.
</p>

<p>
	At the moment of awakening you realize that you will reincarnate infinitely, forever. Because you cannot die. This means the big Self, not the ego. The ego was a fiction to begin with. It never was. But the big Self takes on infinite forms.
</p>

<p>
	There are many good scientific articles.
</p>

<p>
	Science, by its very nature, is a collective consensus-building activity. So if you're gonna use science at all -- and what other choice do you have? -- you're gonna have to accept a lot of stuff as expert hearsay.
</p>

<p>
	So in this example you were just being too dismissive and smartassy.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, stage Green & Turquoise must build on top of stage Orange rather than excluding and denying it.
</p>

<p>
	Science denial is not a tenable position. What you can do instead is talk about various ways to interpret the science, various ways to recontextualize empirical data.
</p>

<title>Is shyness a belief or a truth</title>

</p>

<p>
	But the root source causing the shyness is falsehood. You are shy because you have fear. And all fear is falsehood.
</p>

<p>
	Uncovering why you are fearful in social situations will ultimately eliminate the shyness.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is overcome by understanding what it is you fear, why you fear it, and facing that fear.

<p>
	This is a very poor framing of the situation.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I convinced myself that my learning mathematics would hurt everyone I care about.

<p>
	Enlightenment makes you more capable of helping, loving, and healing everyone you care about. This is the proper framing.

<p>
	A) That video is only one perspective, not the absolute truth. It showcases one facet of a complex issue.
</p>

<p>
	B) That video was primarily about language, but questioning, understanding, and insight goes way deeper than symbols and language.

	Awakening and enlightenment are the same. Don't over-complicate this.
</p>

<p>
	You will never get everyone on the same page, but that doesn't matter. It's like trying to get everyone to agree that red and crimson are the same thing.

<p>
	It's a quality problem to have.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually you'll probably get so over-stuffed with self-help theory that you will need to detox from it.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually, to deeply awaken, you'll have to let go of the desire for hoarding theory. But right now you might still be at the point where more theory is helpful to you. You'll have to play it by ear.

<p>
	I'm seeing a lot of misunderstanding going on here.
</p>

<p>
	Watch your projections and assumptions about enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is simply consciousness of the Absolute Truth. No particular behaviors or lifestyle correspond with this. Behaviors and lifestyles can vary greatly.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to be deeply enlightened be still be manipulative, abusive, addicted to things, etc.

</p>

<p>
	Try adopting a curiosity mindset about this. Just be curious about what your mind and body are doing. Become an impartial watcher of them.

</p>

<p>
	Reality is not like how materialists think it is: an external static object. Rather it is a dynamic mindscape. How you use your mind makes an enormous difference in how you experience reality.

<p>
	Of course you should try to maintain as high a consciousness state as much as you can.
</p>

<p>
	This is transformation, this is growth. You will change and people around you will start to notice it and they will usually not like it because they expect you to be the old self. Become your new self anyways. Change requires the old dying to the new.
</p>

<p>
	A metamorphosis must happen. You are the caterpillar turning into the butterfly. Other caterpillars will not understand your new butterfly form until they do it themselves.

</p>

<p>
	In a high state of consciousness you will not be criticizing anyone. In the same way that you will not be doing violence in a state of high consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	This does not mean people aren't being dangerous fools. There are plenty of dangerous fools in the world. But criticizing fools is itself a delusion because fools cannot help being fools. The more proper attitude is to have compassion and understanding of their state of ignorance.

A normal human cannot focus like that without rigorous training.

<p>

<p>
	I don't think these are impossible questions. I have found that all these types of questions can be answered. It just requires enormous levels of consciousness and lots of contemplating.
</p>

<p>
	It takes many years to answer them all. I don't yet have a satisfactory answer to what is understanding.
</p>

<p>
	I've found that psychedelics are the best way to answer these questions.

	You need to go deeper. The shallow version of these insights can feel empty and hollow. The deeper versions of these insights are full love, beauty, joy, and radiance.
</p>

<p>
	Deeper!
</p>

<p>
	And also remember The Dark Night Of The Soul. You might be going through that phase. It will pass.

<title>Elon Musk, &quot;...nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week&quot;</title>

<p>
	There are times when I work a lot. There are times in life when you need to work a lot. But this should be done strategically, in bursts, not as a chronic habit in an attempt to avoid spiritual work (which is what Elon Musk is doing -- avoiding spiritual work).
</p>

<p>
	Work will NEVER make you satisfied. If work made people satisfied then Elon Musk should be the most satisfied guy in the planet. And yet he is clearly miserable. He has turned work into a neurosis.
</p>

<p>
	I find that if I work too much I start to feel like a robot and I lose my creativity and passion for life.
</p>

<p>
	The times I am most creative and connected to life is on my days off.

<p>
	I use the word contemplation somewhat differently than he does.
</p>

<p>
	He explains his version of contemplation in his book. It sort of includes concentration, meditation, and wondering. It requires extreme concentration. So extreme that it does not work for me.
</p>

<p>
	You need concentration so strong you can bore a hole through a brick wall.

<p>
	This means nothing. You are still totally lost in concepts. It does not mater what you believe, the fact remains that you are under the delusion of being a self.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking you are not a self is not the same thing as actually not being a self.
</p>

<p>
	It is the difference between thinking you are a millionaire and actually being one.

<p>
	No you don't! That's the point!
</p>

<p>
	You're grossly underestimating understanding and language.
</p>

<p>
	The point is: how do you know what a slap means? This requires a radical degree of intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	How do you know that the word CAT actually means that furry things sitting on the chair? It takes an enlightenment-like insight to get that!!! It's a massive epiphany to realize that CAT means anything at all. Intelligence is required.
</p>

<p>
	You might think, "But Leo, I can just point at the cat and say CAT and the child will know." No! No! No! How does the child know what pointing is? That already assumes a massive degree of meaning and intelligence.
</p>

<p>
	Try pointing out a cat to a donkey. He will have no idea that your finger means anything. Pointing only works because you had a massive insight when you were young that pointing is possible.
</p>

<p>
	Do not underestimate how intelligent all of this is.
</p>

<p>
	Lol, you can't falsify truth!
</p>

<p>
	You're still not getting it. Enlightenment not an idea or a belief.
</p>

<p>
	You are God. I'm not saying that poetically or metaphorically. It is the case. You created the entire dream you call this universe. And now you're acting like you didn't. You cannot falsify this because it is true. All you can do is realize it or not.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not a sensation. And cause does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	Your mistake is that you think you can think your way out of this problem. But you can't.

<p>
	There is no such thing as "peaceful". What is good for you is bad for someone else. Even the Buddha cannot take a step without killing life.
</p>

<p>
	And without a survival drive those robots would all be easily destroyed by people.

<p>
	A single word is not an understanding of anything.
</p>

<p>
	The word CAT contains no understanding.
</p>

<p>
	Meaning is not something a word has. Meaning is the relationship of differences between words.
</p>

<p>
	I talked about this to some extent in my video on Deconstruction, Derrida, and Post-Modernism.

	The whole point of a good democracy is that it protects minority rights.
</p>

<p>
	In any other system the minorities would be killed or enslaved.

<p>
	The detachment isn't a bug, it's the key feature.
</p>

<p>
	Stay mindful of how the mind assigns negative meaning to meaninglessness.
</p>

<p>
	Try to see the good in this, the pure beauty of being.

</p>

<p>
	The Christians will say it's their clergy. The Muslims will say it's their most fundamenalist clerics. The atheists will say it's people like Richard Dawkins. The white nationalists will say it's their Aryan brothers. The post-modernists will say it's people like Jacques Derrida. The oil companies will say its their well-paid anti global warming shill scientists. The tobacco companies will say it's their tobacco doesn't harm people shill scientists.
</p>

<p>
	If the materialist scientists are given control of the government they will outlaw all religion, spirituality, and mysticism and you will be enslaved by robots, AI, and corporatism.
</p>

<p>
	See, you guys are underestimating the depth of this problem.
</p>

<p>
	Who is gonna arbitrate what is true and good? See, you assume truth and goodness is just an objective given, but it isn't, it's relative.

	Lol, and then all those islands rape, pillage, and ensalve each other.
</p>

<p>
	That's called human history circa ancient Rome.
</p>

<p>
	You can't have neutral robots. There is no such thing as neutral. Those robots will have their own self-interest and will ensalve everyone else. Or whoever built those robots will just build even better ones to kill the old ones and enslave the other islands.
</p>

<p>
	Democracy and multiculturalism are the solutions which evolved to solve this thousands years old problem.

<p>
	I don't fit well on this map because I've done a lot of crazy psychedelics. The map was not designed to account for psychedelics.

<p>
	I've definitely seen the ox very deeply a bunch of times. But I haven't permanently caught the ox yet or tamed it.
</p>

<p>
	But there's something to be said for very deep seeing of the ox, even if it's just temporary, it still changes your view of the world. You're never quite the same again.

	But it sounds like an ideological thing, which isn't good. They will probably frame your experience in an ethnocentric stage Blue framework, which would be very limiting.

A whole pill is too much. It will be to stimulating for most cases. But 1/2 or 1/4th is just right.
</p>

<p>
	Try combining it with L-Theanine which should reduce the monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	1 whole pill of Armodafinil is like not even 1/20th as strong as a mild dose of psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	A decent dose of psychedelic will literally melt the walls of your room.
</p>

<p>
	A decent dose of 5-MeO will make you forget you or your life ever existed. You will expand to fill the entire universe.

</p>

<p>
	It was a moment of illumination or a minor samadhi. Your visual field becomes "divinized", you see the divinity of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I'm just guessing here.
</p>

<p>
	It was a tiny glimpse. This is just the tip of an iceberg. Much more spiritual practice is required to take this deeper.

<p>
	Usually people who get serious paranormal abilities have always has a psychic sense since they were young. It was just usually weak, suppressed, denied, or underdeveloped. Then it gets super-charged.
