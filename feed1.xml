<p>
	This entire conversation is devolving into masturbation and confusion.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between enlightenment in Buddhism and Hinduism or any other major religion.

<p>
	Not in the slightest.
</p>

<p>
	But I did have a powerful vision for my life, I was very ambitious, and I was following my heart. Which is really all that matters.
</p>

<p>
	You are young. You've got many years to put all of those things in place. Obviously don't waste time sitting around on your ass, but don't panic either.
</p>

<p>
	Right now what you're missing is hope and faith in your vision.
</p>

<p>
	Vision is useless if you don't have rock-solid faith in it. You need to train yourself to believe in it. Visualize it every day with a hopeful vibe. Do not visualize it pessimistically, negatively, full of fear. That is terrible. That is counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	Holding a big vision is not easy. It is scary. Your mind will not believe it is possible. I used all sorts of mind programming techniques to reinforce my vision and overcome various doubts. But the most important thing is HEART! You must have HEART! That is what carries you through everything. Your life purpose must be non-negotiable. You are doing it no matter what. There should be no option for failure because you already know there is nothing else you'd rather do.
</p>

<p>
	There will hundreds of doubts in this journey. You have to really cultivate hope. Not in luck, but in your hard work. Your vision will get actualized through honest labor.
</p>

<p>
	And remember, a big vision requires lots of patience. You don't need to be Buddha by next month. Recalibrate your exceptions and split your vision up into smaller chunks, so you are not evaluating your progress based on whether you are like Ralston or Buddha. That may not happen for 40 years. And that's okay, you don't need that to enjoy your life.
</p>

<p>
	Discipline yourself to do the work.

<p>
	Tripping alone is my fave.
</p>

<p>
	125ug of LSD is about as powerful as 2-3g of dried mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Of course potencies can vary. A lot of LSD dosages are exaggerated. So if your source isn't good, a 125ug dose could actually be 70ug, which would be a weak trip. 125ug is a nice solid trip for me, but still very managable, still possible to walk around.
</p>

<p>
	At 300ug you probably wouldn't be able to walk.
</p>

For how long? How seriously are you doing them?
</p>

<p>
	Nothing else really matters. That is the key. Without serious practices you will never get enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Which teacher you listen to doesn't really matter if you don't have your practices down. And once you have your practices down you hardly need a teacher at all. That is the paradox of spiritual work. No one can do it for you.

But I did not say living on the beach like a bum. I said buying your own land and building a small shack. That is very doable if you save up some money. In Hawaii you can even live off the grid using solar panels and a rainwater catchment tank. Heating and A/C are virtually unnecessary there.
</p>

<p>
	See my Hawaii solo retreat blog videos.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you don't need to slave. Learning how to make money is not hard. There many ways to earn six figures per year and enjoy the process. You just need a vision to do it. You can't be doing it out of a desire to become a bum. Cultivate a desire to genuinely contribute to humanity. It is so much more fulfilling and pays well when properly designed.
</p>

<p>
	Learn some business, sales, and marketing skills. This is easily acheieved online through courses, workshops, audios, and books.
</p>

<p>
	You also need a plan for getting old. Your health will worsen and so will your ability to work. Healthcare ain't cheap. Don't take stuff like healthcare for granted. Without government you'd probably die in your 50's or 60's due to lack of healthcare, disablity, etc.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The solution is to have it.
</p>

<p>
	This can be done easily with 1 hour using psychedelics. Which is precisely why they are such an important tool. Advanced practitions do not need psychedelics because they are aleady had many mystical experiences and are fully bought in. Newbies need psychedelics to show them what they are missing, what it would take them 10 years of harcore practice to glimpse.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the scientific way of finding God. They are totally empircal and easily replicatable. Clinically proven beyond any placebo or doubt. That's what makes them such useful tool. Never before in human history has there such an easy route to spirituality for newbies as with today's modern psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	This issue of doubting mysticism is utterly unneccessary in today's age. You might as well be doubting kangroos. If you doubt so much, why not just go to the zoo and pet a kangroo? It costs $30 and takes 1 hr.
</p>

<p>
	This is extremely ignorant thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Without government you would not even be able to live in a house in the forest because some gang would come slit your throat in the middle of the night or enslave you and seize your house. Without goverment you would not even have enough education to know what a country is! You would not have the internet, or property rights, you would not even know how to read or write, and many other things that you take for granted.
</p>

<p>
	Hawaii has very low property tax and the land there can be very cheap on the Big Island. You can buy plots of land for $30,000 and Hawaii weather is so nice you can basically live in a tent or a yurt and grow your own fruits and have chickens for eggs. Although food and construction in Hawaii costs about 1.5x more than mainland USA.
</p>

<p>
	But don't expect survival to be free. That is just ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than planning to be a leech, think of ways you can contribute to society. You will be much happier that way. It is not that hard for example to set up your own farm and meditation retreat center.

You must make a distinction between thinking this stuff and observation of actuality. Less thinking, more observation is necessary. Learn to sit and observe without emotionally reacting to anything at all. Stop judging things, stop fantasizing about the future or the past. Stop thinking about yourself. Stop thinking about your life. Just sit and observe the present moment. In the present moment there is nothing sad or bad.
</p>

<p>
	Start to notice when you are conscious vs when you are reacting emotionally to anything at all.

<title>How often to Trip on LSD</title>

<p>
	Every 2 weeks is good as long as you're integrating the insights well. You will naturally not want to trip that often after a while because the trips should get too deep.

<p>
	Sounds like you're describing Samadhi: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi</a>
</p>

<p>
	Which is basically a mild version of nondual consciousness / mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	But you are only feeling the tip of the iceberg now. With more practice it will go much deeper. It can even go so deep that your body and the entire universe will disappear!
</p>

<p>
	It feels timeless because it is! Time is a concept created by the mind. When the mind is still for long enough, time will cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, every moment, every experience you've ever had, has been, and currently is, timeless.
</p>

Socialization is a skill set. Being intimate with women is a skill set. You need many hours of practice to get good at it, especially if you're shy, awkward, under-socialized, autistic, or very introverted.
</p>

<p>
	Put yourself into a lot more social situations/relationships and practice being very authentic, vulnerable, and intimate. Not sexually, but conversationally, emotionally, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse sex for intimacy.
</p>

<p>
	A little game you could play with yourself is to try to see how fast you can get real intimate with a total stranger. Like, walk up to a random person at a Starbucks and try to get intimate with them within 15 minutes of conversation. The trick is to do it without creeping them out. The first few times you try it you will come across weird and creepy. But through experience you will learn how to make it feel natural and positive for the both of you.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, and BTW, the whole trick to sleeping with women quickly is building intimacy quickly. You can do it within 1 hour of meeting her through lots of training. There are many tricks to speed this along, like being fully present, having very strong eye contact, speaking slowly, smiling, being warm and friendly, and touching her body frequently in a non-creepy manner.
</p>

<p>
	It's amazing when done right. But requires enormous practice unless you're "a natural." Which obviously you aren't otherwise we wouldn't be having this conversation.
</p>

<title>What is ego-death?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/30266-what-is-ego-death/?do=findComment&amp;comment=351821</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	In the very moment of ego-death it is realized that your biological birth was just a story. It is realized that you are not a physical or a biological object, but an idea. This idea is eliminated, as though it never existed. Not only that, it becomes almost impossible to imagine how you ever thought you existed.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine life minus you.
</p>

<p>
	That's ego death. Everything stays the same. But you are missing!
</p>

<p>
	In other words, absolutely nothing changes! Just its always been, and how is right now!
</p>

<p>
	There is no you reading this sentence. The sense that there is a you reading this sentence is a fantasy. The end of this fantasy is ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	Ego-death is not an idea or a belief, it is state of consciousness. Accessing this state of consciousness requires intense concentration and stillness of the conceptualize mind. The conceptualizing mind is what is sustaining the fantasy of a you in the same way that a video game console sustains the appearance of Super Mario. If the console is unplugged, Mario disappears.
</p>

	I had a bad allergic reaction this week to the medicine (penicillin) for my sinus infection, which made me feel even worse and covered me in red rashy burning spots from head to toe. So video will be late, depending on when this clears up.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry for me, I'll be fine. I just can't shoot videos in this state. It should pass soon.

<title>Can someone explain art to me?</title>

<p>
	If you were awake you would realize the entire Cosmos is one epic work of art, from the galaxies to the viruses to the terrorists to the homeless person begging for coins on the side of the road.
</p>

<p>
	It's easier to ask, what isn't art?
</p>

<p>
	And the answer is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't see infinite artistry all around you it's because you're way too self-involved, hypnotized by satisfying your basic survival needs.
</p>

<p>
	The solution? Daily spiritual practice.
</p>

<p>
	Since YOU are God, you'd be worshipping yourself. That is okay as long as you're aware that you are worshipping yourself. Then it becomes like a cosmic masturbation session. And since you are the only thing in existence, all action is ultimately masturbation.

<p>
	Loving only those parts of reality which serve you or make you feel good.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, like I said, ego (you) is incapable of true love. True love requires eliminating ego. This requires some serious spiritual practices like Kriya yoga or self-inquiry or psychedelics.

<p>
	Since all is one and there is nothing but The Self, self-love is really the only kind of love.
</p>

<p>
	But this not the self you imagine you are. I am speaking of loving the entire universe unconditionally, especially all the evil stuff your self hates. That is true Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is not capable of real love. It only knows pseudo-love. Ego only cares about gets it needs met. That is not real love. That is egotism.

Taking antidepressants will only make things worse. It's like you're pressing the gas pedal and then slamming the parking break.
</p>

<p>
	What you need to do is become conscious of what this depressed feeling is about. Why it is happening? Not on a personal or psychological level but in an existential level. Why do you suffer at all? What is suffering about? What is sadness? Why purpose does it serve? Why are you creating it?
</p>

<p>
	In this work you must suffer consiously, otherwise you aren't really learning anything, you are just acting out unconscious egoic patterns. You could do that for 50 years and not come out any wiser or awake.

<p>
	Psychedelics have been used by all cultures for over 20,000 years for this purpose. So there is no disputing it. Not to mention the clinical studies.
</p>

<p>
	The distinction between objective and subjective does not exist. There is no such thing as subjective experience really. That is an illusion created by the ego. All "subjective experience" is actually Absolute Being if the ego is absent.
</p>

<p>
	Being is prior to proof. Truth is prior to proof. Proof is a concept, Truth is actuality.

The ego is not just gonna let you meditate. The more you push yourself to meditate the more you will overcome this defense mechanism. It will get better.
</p>

<p>
	One trick that works well for me is to meditate right after taking a nap.
</p>

<p>
	Also, meditate with your eyes open.
</p>

<p>
	You could also switch to Kriya yoga instead of meditation. It's very hard to fall asleep doing Kriya yoga even if you are sleepy because it involves more activity.

</p>

<p>
	The question is, what do you want here?
</p>

<p>
	If you DO want to meditate every day but you are still struggling, that's a problem of self-discipline and integrity. You are making the commitment but then breaking your own word, which hurts your self esteem.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality usually requires developing hardcore discipline because otherwise the ego is too tricky and will never allow itself to be significantly undermined.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe try some strong determination sits. Bordem and extreme suffering during meditation is par for the course. Some of the greatest suffering I've ever had was during my solo meditation retreats. You cannot even imagine how much bordem and suffering happens there. Imagine bordem so bad it is literally killing you.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation is not all rainbows and peace. Meditation is hell from the ego's POV.
</p>

<title>Is the Dark Night of The Soul the same as Ego Death?</title>

My question is basically if you are progressively surrendering your ego, your emotions and the idea that you ever existed more and more but do not fully surrender/die, will you have to 'start over' in this die off process or is it just the final surrender you have to endure?

<p>
	The ego is relentless.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like reeling in a giant fish. You reel it in a few feet, then it runs out a few feet of line. A long tug of war ensues. If the fish is big enough it might even break the line and escape. You must slowly wear it down and the deliver the final blow.
</p>

<p>
	Any course of spirituality or development can become pathological.
</p>

<p>
	But it is also possible to land the fish. You must become a good fisherman.

</p>

<p>
	If you are already into spirituality and nonduality why waste your time with Western philosophy? Why not invest that time deepening your spiritual practice?
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to do things just because other people are doing them. Be independent and don't do useless things with your life. Be highly selective with how you invest your time.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe spend your time studying something more practical.

It is the ego going through its final death throes. The ego can still bounce back with a vengeance and not complete the ego death.

<p>
	It's hard to replicate this issue. Most of the time the site and forum load fine for me and others. But at the same time, for example on my mobile device, sometimes the site and forum fail to load.
</p>

<p>
	If you guys are still experiencing this problem could you please check the site and forum on multiples devices/connections and report back under what circumstances there are loading problems. Is this an intermittent thing?
</p>

<p>
	We're still trying to pin-point what the issue is.
</p>

<p>
	Please mention which device/OS/browser you're experiencing these issues under. For example I do not experience any issues on Windows Firefox or Windows Chrome. But I have been having issues on Android.

That requires decades of patient, serious practice.
</p>

<p>
	Now is the time to discipline yourself and start doing the practices.
</p>

<p>
	Re-calibrate your expectations. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

<title>The Impossible Nothingness Beyond Absolute Infinity</title>

Otherwise such questions and issues would not arise. Maybe you got a taste of it, but not the Full Monty. You need to go back and directly experience the Fully Monty.
</p>

<p>
	To say there is something beyond the Absolute is silly. The Absolute is Absolute and there is nothing beyond it because it is total.
</p>

<p>
	You are still holding Nothingness and Infinity as distinct things, which is a duality, which must be further collapsed, thus resolving this entire thread.
</p>

<p>
	What more is there to say if you are fully conscious of the Absolute? The Absolute is all there is. There is nothing but the Absolute.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Form is formlessness. Fromlessness is form.
</p>

<p>
	You are creating a duality out of nothing and infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Also, there is an infinite number of different systems of logic. So which ever logic you're using is arbitrary and relative. Absolute Infinity is not limited to logic because it created logic and holds an infinite number of logical systems within it, including all the stuff you deem illogical. The very distinction you create between logical and illogical means there is logical stuff and illogical stuff, which the illogical stuff being greater in quantity than the logical stuff.
</p>

<p>
	YOU are creating all of these distinctions between logic/illogic, infinity/nothing, life/death, self/other, true/false, etc. Ultimate nonduality is the realization that all of these distinctions are relative and impermanent.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Only a fool hastily disassembles a complex piece of machinery without first studying its inner workings.
</p>

<p>
	A common problem with young revolutionaries is that they end up creating a worse system than the one they rail against because they underestimate the practical realities such a system must contend with.
</p>

<p>
	Success requires striking a delicate balance between the old and the new, the status quo and the cutting edge, between the practical and ideal.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise you easily end up with something like a cult, a communist revolution, or Bioshock: a dystopian abomination.

</p>

<p>
	Meditation is everywhere all of the time! Meditation is reality. You don't have to be sitting on the cushion to be aware of stuff. Some people are naturally meditating all the time without even giving it a label or using any formal techniques. So yeah, side-effects are to be expected out of the blue in some people. Some people even have spontaneous kundalini awakenings.
</p>

<p>
	The harder you meditate the more side-effects you are likely to have.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like if I told you that by doing weightlifting you can get sore muscles, and some people respond in the comments: "But Leo! I don't do any weightlifitng and I still get sore muscles."
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, of course! Because weightlifting is not the only way to get sore muscles.
</p>

<p>
	The universe has no rules. You are free to do whatever.
</p>

<p>
	Survival is often messy and dirty. If you can actually use this opportunity to help awaken mankind, then that would be wise to do, otherwise what's the alternative for you?
</p>

<p>
	But be careful not to fall into the trap of using a noble purpose to justify all sorts of selfish behavior, the way that cults like to do. That comes with a high karmic cost.

<p>
	Universe = everything that is. The sum total of everything.
</p>

<p>
	The universe is a dream-like hallucination, an illusion. It is form. All form is an illusion because form is identical to formlessness or Nothingness. So in a sense the universe both does and does not exist simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that existence/non-existence is a duality. As you should know by now, all dualities ultimately collapse into an undifferentiated unity.
</p>

<p>
	The reason it doesn't make sense is because you are trying to use the mind to grasp nonduality, but the mind only understanding things via dualistic categories like good/bad, true/false, part/whole, life/death, etc.
</p>

<p>
	What's required is a nondual mystical experience. You must actually become nondual, not just think about it or talk about it. BE IT! To be it you must eliminate all thinking. When all thinking stops, what remains is the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Just think of it like this: you are inside a video game. The video game world is not real, but it appears real to you because you are hypnotized by it. If you realize you are in a video game, the video game world will instantly lose all of its reality. You will say of it: "It isn't real" and yet despite that, the video game world still has a certain form and certain rules which must be obeyed so long as you are in it.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to put it: you could kill yourself right now and it wouldn't make any difference. But you would never do that because you believe too much that this is real. It's not actually real. But you are too scared to find out. So you stay stuck in the illusion, at least until death, at which point you'll realize your entire life was just a hallucination with zero import or reality.
</p>

<p>
	Your whole sticking point here is that you absolutely refuse to admit that your life isn't real. And no amount of logic will convince you of it because your fear of death is totally irrational and insane. You are literally insane and you don't want to admit. So here we are! How much longer are you gonna keep denying your insanity?
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to understand nonduality without facing your own death. But you should not mistake what I am saying as an invitation to harm the physical body.
</p>

	Yes, your business can get fucked at any time, and if you neglect it for too long, it will probably die. Such is life. There is no life without death. The solution is to accept it and face your fear of failure/business-death. I used to get these fears a lot. I still get them to some extent but a lot less so after my many mystical experiences, which teach me that death is inevitable and nothing to be afraid of. After you experience a few physical deaths, business death doesn't seem so serious any more.
</p>

<p>
	That said, if you are going to be running a business you should run it well, strategically. Think about ways to make your business more future-proof and self-sustaining. You can do that without being paranoid about it. Make the distinction between being strategic and proactive vs being paranoid. You can do one without doing the other and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	Of course your survival is tied to your business performance. Business IS survival. The solution here it is not get too wrapped up in survival. Yes, survival is necessary but don't make your entire life about survival. Don't make your entire business about survival. You must skillfully evolve your business beyond survival to incorporate play, artistry, beauty, and consciousness. This must be done while still keeping one eye on your finances. Just like how an artist cannot paint all day long without eating food. But it would be a mistake for him to get so paranoid about food that all he does all day is eat food and never paints. A balance must be struck between eating food and making art. Likewise between business and art.
</p>

<p>
	Most successful entrepreneurs end up workaholics. You should probably make time for other stuff like relationships, travel, spirituality, etc. Do that without neglecting your business. If you're earning $100,000 you should have enough money to hire a bit of extra help. Consider hiring an online contractor to help you out. Consider how to align your art with your biz.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, I always feel a desire to grow and expand my biz. But I have to be disciplined and say NO! to lots of opportunities because biz is not as important as spirituality, for example. I pass up on a lot of opportunities because biz cannot be your #1 priority in the end. That way lies disaster.
</p>

<p>
	How do I handle fears of my business getting fucked? At this point I've basically stopped caring. I've almost stopped caring if I die. This was made possible through spiritual work and profound mystical experiences which show me that biz and life are just a hallucination. None of my life or work really matter. This is all just a game. It's being done for fun and artistry. You could get run over by a bus tomorrow. So why worry about it? Getting over the fear of loss of my business took many years of work. It also helped that I saved up a comfortable nest egg. My YT channel could die tomorrow and I would still be able to live for 15 years without working. I strategically designed it this way. You can too. Not in a week, but in a few years time you could.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes I still think of the business aspects of things, but at this point in my life, career, and development I spend more time thinking about living in a cave than running a business. You are not at this point yet. Maybe you'll get there in 5-10 years of work. It all depends on what your goals are for your life. For me, the point of business is to enable my passion and artistry. Design your business such that it allows you to do your art. Artsy fartsy stuff is not waste of time if it part of your life purpose and your life purpose is fueling your biz. The whole point is to align all these things in a balanced way.
</p>

<p>
	If you set up your business properly, you should be able to take time off to pursue spirituality, travel, leisure, art, relationships, etc. That will take some years to actualize, but it's worth it. The first few years of building a business usually requires LOTS of hours of non-stop work. But the whole point of all that work is so that in the future your business is more or less on auto-pilot.
</p>

<p>
	Tie the artsy-fartsy stuff to the success of your biz.
</p>

<p>
	Remember the importance of dynamic balance. See my balance video.
</p>

<p>
	Have a long-term strategic plan.
</p>

<p>
	Automate, outsource, and streamline stuff as much as you can.
</p>

<p>
	Fear is always a psychological self-deception game. Your fear is something you want to contemplate and face head on. Just building your biz more is never going to solve the fear of losing your biz. Your biz could be making $1 billion per year and you'd still fear losing it. Even more so! Because fear is never based in reality, it is purely mental. So explore that. To really overcome fear you must do deep spiritual work. Fear is inevitable without enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, you're on the right track. Just fine-tune things and take it to the next level. Next level does not necessarily mean: more money & bigger biz. Next level means: a new balance, or action at a higher level of consciousness.
</p>

<title>Question about Karma and Day Trading Stocks( Leo ? :-)</title>

If daytrading offers no value, setting yourself up as a trainer of daytraders is just doubling down on the problem, you see? You are effectively creating a pyramid scheme. The whole point of a pyramid scheme is that it takes a product or service of no genuine value and makes it appear to have short-term value by convincing other people that it has value.
</p>

<p>
	If you realize that daytrading has little to no value, why are you positioning yourself to teach it to other people? You just geometrically multiplied your bad karma. It's as if I told you that robbing people's houses created bad karma so you come back to me and say, "What if I don't do any robbing myself but instead I train hundreds of people how to rob houses?" Lol
</p>

<p>
	Go create something which you know offers massive genuine value for mankind. Teach that!
</p>

<p>
	Do you really want to spend your precious time on this Earth teaching daytrading? Is that what you want your life to be remembered as: the daytrading guy? Is that really the best thing you can think of?
</p>

It was a bit humiliating and stifling but a necessary step towards actualizing my life purpose. After about 3 months I was making enough money to move out and live on my own. And I was even able to help pay for my Mom's apartment after she separated from my Dad.
</p>

<p>
	The key is to hustle and make shit happen. Don't be dicking around. Create results!
</p>

<p>
	Teach yourself how to survive in this world.

Most people need a rather large dose of it to break through, and the problem is, they are too afraid to do it. They do 1 or 2 small trips and call it quits before the breakthrough happens. Because the ego is hellbent on preventing enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics do not work on people who are not metaphysically curious and serious. This is not a pursuit for lazy people just dicking around. You have to be serious about reaching Truth. You have to be willing to try and fail many times. I have no respect for people who do 2 trips and call it quits.

The key is to keep your base desires well-regulated via consciousness and wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, you can shit, but don't shit where you eat.
</p>

<p>
	You can have sex, but do so responsibly, authentically, and consciously.
</p>

<p>
	Or be an animal. It's up to you.

<p>
	Seriously though, the problem with people who have multiple partners is that they do not know how to relate consciously with 1 partner, nevermind 3 or 5.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like those parents who don't know how to raise or feed 1 child, yet they have 5. <img alt="¬¬" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/dry.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/dry@2x.png 2x" title="¬¬" width="20" />

<p>
	Classic case of biting off more than you can chew. It's a form of greediness.

Don't expect others to solve the hard problems for you. Your role is to create solutions to all of those sticky problems like financing, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can start by studying & researching education theory. There are many serious scholars, experts, and academics working on the problems of education. But you should also realize that the biggest obstacles will always be bureaucratic, political, marketing, and financing.
</p>

<p>
	Education is a very touchy political issue. People are not just going to let you wake up their kids. They want their children properly indoctrinated.
</p>

<p>
	It will be very challenging to pitch a stage Yellow school to stage Blue/Orange parents in a stage Blue/Orange community.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about this vision, you should think of a way to gain 1st-hand experience with the actual issues of education. You can do this by getting a job within the education field and study it from the inside. Otherwise you will lack 1st-hand experience and your solutions will be utopian fantasies, not anything workable in the real world.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with lofty visions is that they also must square with how the real world works and the level of development that people are at. Coming up with grand visions is relatively easy. The hard part is figuring out how to actualize them.

	1) Clean up your diet
</p>

<p>
	2) Go to the gym regularly
</p>

<p>
	3) Contemplate any psychlogical anxiety issues you have which are creating this
</p>

<p>
	4) Get your testosterone levels checked via blood work.
</p>

<p>
	5) Try taking Maca supplement pills. They are crazy effective and all-natural. Natural Viagra that will make you a sex machine.

<p>
	Relationships are paradoxical. You're damned if you do and damned if you don't.
</p>

<p>
	But I don't find maintaining a harem to be too developed or conscious. In my experience people who do that are generally not too developed. They are thinking with their genitals which can't lead to anything good.

</p>

<p>
	I knew kids like that guy in elementary school. They would just draw all day long in class and they were fucking GOOD. My Mom is actually like that.
</p>

<p>
	From what I can gather, it requires a certain highly specialized brain type. Which then leads to 1000s of hours of practice because their brain type loves doing it.
</p>

<p>
	I would guess I'm the same as that guy, but with philosophy instead of art. To me philosophy is like an artform, and it comes as easily as that guy's drawings, but then there is also of course a ton of practice that goes into it.
</p>

<p>
	To do that much practice demands that you really love doing it.
</p>

	A stage Orange person will use Bitcoin for stage Orange purposes. Which is basically why Bitcoin crashed in the last year. All the stage Orange Wallstreet-types wanted to use it to get rich quick.
</p>

<p>
	Some people see Bitcoin and all they think about is how to use it to make money.

It will still sting and drip.

			Do you think those existing systems are working against moving up the Spiral? And why its harder for older generation or people in lower tiers to move up to Green?

</blockquote>

<p>
	The older generations are not staying still. They too are evolving. Just not as fast as you whippersnappers would like.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, it's due to the rigidity of the mind. The mind is resistant to change. It's a fundamental survival mechanic.

Keep up your spiritual practices and don't get distracted by weird sensations. Weird sensations will arise and pass away. What you really want is to open that crown chakra and have an awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Educate yourself about Kundalini Awakening. Read some books about it. I have books on my book list about the ups and downs of the process.

There are of course many individual exceptions. So don't stereotype people too much.
</p>

<p>
	The main reason it's true is because as the infrastructure of society evolves lower survival needs becomes easier and easier to satisfy to the point where you don't need to even think about them. Older generations had to worry about a neighboring tribe raping and pillaging their village. Modern generations don't have this worry because government infrastructure (like the modern court and police system) has been built to prevent that.
</p>

<p>
	Your value system reflects the environment you're trying to survive in. As the environment evolves, so must your values, beliefs, and worldview if you wish to be effective at survival.
</p>

<p>
	A slave owner would not be able to survival for long in today's environment. But 500 years ago it was almost the opposite. Owning slaves raised your survival. Because the environment was so different. Humans have changed their environment so much that slavery became counter-productive. Which is why today slavery is no longer considered acceptable.
</p>

<p>
	The moral of the story is: your values are totally contingent on your survival needs, which change constantly as evolution progresses. And the rate of progress is accelerating. So newer generations are more different than they were in the past.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Inner affects the outer.
</p>

<p>
	Outer affects the inner.
</p>

<p>
	Because inner = outer. In truth everything is one! So work on both, work on THE ONE.
</p>

<p>
	If you're surrounded by an unhealthy, toxic environment, change it ASAP. That will free you up to do serious inner work. And if you're stuck in an environment with no idea of how to break free, change your inner game, which will allow you to escape that environment.
</p>

<p>
	You can burn the candle from both ends.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there definitely are generational differences as each generation of humans gets indoctrinated into newer, more advanced cultural ways of thinking.
</p>

<p>
	It's almost like with smartphones. Each new generation of smartphones comes with new, more advanced software. It is hard to install the latest software on old hardware, mostly due to rigidity of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	I'll have a video on this topic in the future.

<p>
	Yes, but be careful what you wish for. They will not only show you stuff you've been hiding, they will give you a glimpse of insanity.

<p>
	Mushrooms have a trickster like quality to them. They will play tricks on you and fuck with your sense of reality in crazy ways at higher dosages.

<p>
	Mushrooms tend to be extremely hypnotic. They will mesmerize you in ways you cannot imagine and words cannot explain.
