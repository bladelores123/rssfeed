	4 billion years of fear were required to engineer your body and mind so that it can survive long enough to learn the word "love".

			HI Leo!

		</p>

		<p>
			Really appreciate your help. I will do this and focus on other girls meanwhile and educate myself in this topic. Question - I really want her and we connect on phone so there is a cemestry. The problem (I think) is that I have been to pushy regarding to her and when we was gonna meet I sounded a bit stressed a desperate to book this which she then said "You make me feel so stressed" so I changed subjet and said haha ok but I need to know so I can plan my days but no worries lets decide next week. And this week she avoided the question. So my strategy no (Since I have accepted that this can fail but still really want to give it a try) is to back down a bit to not be so needy and chill and just talk with her and have fund for a few days to build connection again and when I feel that the mood is good again approach this question again about when we should meet. What do you say?
		</p>

<p>
	You are needy so she will not sleep with you.
</p>

<p>
	You've already lost her. Move on to other girls.

<p>
	Unfortunately not -- because there are many eager young fools waiting to take their place.
</p>

<p>
	Game studios abuse eager young developers who don't know any better.
</p>

<p>
	But also, the reality is that game development is extremely difficult. More difficult than making movies. A movie is easy to make compared to a game. It's extremely easy to fall into the trap of biting off more than your team can chew. Which is exactly what Cyberpunk did.
</p>

<p>
	Everything in game development takes longer than you imagine, even if you plan for it taking longer, it will still take longer than anything you plan. It is a minor miracle whenever a game gets published at all.

	It's not possible to be satisfied with nothing without ego death.
</p>

<p>
	The ego cannot do nothing. It needs to be constantly surviving.
</p>

<p>
	You can gradually detox yourself from stimulation tho. But it won't feel good.

<p>
	It's not a matter of ideology. All these ideas would need to be tested at small scale to see which of them work. Some may not work. Or they may work at low percentages. We need to test what the right percentages are.
</p>

<p>
	For example, we need to test what the best corporate tax rate is. That number should be scientifically derived, not ideology derived.

<p>
	Take a look at the cash reserves of Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and such companies. Tens of billions in cash, not doing much. I propose most of that go to its employees who will actually spend it.

	Right now capitalists and investor class is hoarding most of the world's wealth and using it to milk the working class dry.

<p>
	I use OneNote 2010, which is completely locally stored.
</p>

<p>
	For most people cloud storage is probably good enough. I like local storage because I'm a control freak. Unless you're a power-user or a control freak, cloud storage should meet all your needs. And it is technically more reliable.

<p>
	But in my system your life savings cannot be invested in stock. That's the whole point! You would have stock, but the stock by itself would be worthless unless you're working in the company. All the stock does is pay you dividends as long as you work there. Your true worth would not be in stocks but in cash savings from years of work.
</p>

<p>
	This would effectively eliminate the stock market and its crashes. People will no longer be allowed to speculate on stocks. All the speculator sharks will have to go out and get a real job. Which will put more money in the hands of loyal workers.

<p>
	I generally agree.
</p>

<p>
	Although a public option might be undermined by the American insurance cartel.
</p>

<p>
	It's tricky because if you compromise too much you end up with a system so bad that people hate it.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, nothing gets done without some compromise. The compromises have be strategic.

They have so much power they will try to dismantle and undo any public option.
</p>

<p>
	The American medical cartel is much worse than in any other country.
</p>

<p>
	There is simply no purpose for private insurance companies. It's a total scam. Insurance is the perfect function for government. Government already insures the most essential things. The insurance industry is basically a bunch of grifting middlemen screwing people over to make ridiculous margins for a commodity service. Insurance is as bad as loansharking.
</p>

<p>
	Government can easily create a monopoly on auto insurance, house insurance, disaster insurance, life insurance, health insurance. It would be a huge savings for people.

<p>
	You will earn a lot more under my system because during your entire lifetime of work you will be getting dividends from the company you work for. By being an employee you will automatically be vested in the stock market. So you won't need a 401k. All you'll need is a savings account to hold your earnings.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if every Walmart employee -- even the cashiers and janitors -- earned dividends for every year they worked at Walmart. That would be a just system and they would be a lot richer. Working at Walmart would be a lot more enjoyable.

<p>
	It would not be a blanket ban. It would be gradually phased in over decades and you wouldn't lose all of your stock, maybe some percentage. This percentage could phase in.
</p>

<p>
	We could start with simple law that gives 5% of your stock to your replacement if you leave your company. Nothing would collapse this way. This would encourage managers and executives to actually care about the long-term success of their companies.

<p>
	Yeah, it's radical. Some kind of alternative to Wall Street needs to be invented.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is to break up the consolidation of capital in the hands of a few elites. There need to be systems and laws that push capital downward to average people. One such principle might be that if you leave the company, you lose most of your stock to the guy who replaces you, and holding stock pays automatic dividends if your company makes profit, but only if you work within the company. As soon as you leave, the guy who takes your position gets it.
</p>

<p>
	Passive sources of income need to be gradually eliminated. All passive income comes off the back of wage slaves.

Then it would have been a 9 or 10 out of 10 and sold 40 million copies.

Could you please answer:  does this advice apply to all girls? What about shy serious cold kind of girls? There are some girls which are super open to serious deep conversations but its hard af to get them to be playful and do small talk. When i mean serious deep conversations i am not saying no humor or teasing at all. Just you guys talk about a specific topic rather than changing topics every 20 seconds with 0 meaning or substance like you do during small talk.
		</p>

		<p>
			Really curious about this, what do you think
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Every girl loves humor and charm. There's no such thing as a serous cold girl. She's being that way because you got bad game or she's just not interested in you.
</p>

<p>
	Of course not all girls will be interested in you, in which case you just move on to the next girl.
</p>

<p>
	Attracting girls requires reaching a "hook point" where you can clearly see that she's attracted to you. Hook point is usually reached within 1-5 minutes. If the hook point never comes, then move other girls. Don't waste your time trying to get girls who can't reach hook point within 5-10 mins.
</p>

<p>
	Serious deep conversations can happen after sex.
</p>

<p>
	You can't get any particular girl. Change your strategy to getting girls in general, not one specific girl.
</p>

<p>
	If she's difficult, go talk to 10 other girls and the problem will solve itself.

<p>
	Many problems with capitalism could simply be fixed by passing a few rock solid laws.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		No ownership of stock without being employed by the company
	</li>
	<li>
		No corporate lobbying
	</li>
	<li>
		No corporate political contributions
	</li>
	<li>
		No buying of other big corporations by big corporations
	</li>
	<li>
		Salary caps for executives and management
	</li>
	<li>
		No arbitration clauses in contracts
	</li>
	<li>
		No criminal liability protections for executives
	</li>
	<li>
		No off-shore tax havens and corp tax loopholes
	</li>
	<li>
		All employees get representation on corporate board
	</li>
	<li>
		All employees get profit sharing
	</li>
	<li>
		Higher taxes on successful wealthy corporations
	</li>
	<li>
		Strict environmental regulations
	</li>
	<li>
		Severe fines for corporate fraud or mismanagement
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Simple laws like that, when rigorously enforced, would fix many problems.
</p>

<p>
	These laws are not that difficult to make work. It's just almost impossible to pass them in Congress.
</p>

	Remember, capitalism is not just gonna go away. Whatever comes after it will build on top of it. The foundations of capitalism are too successful to ever completely go away. They will just evolve.
</p>

<p>
	Modern society is far too dependent on giant corporations today to get rid of them. So you need to find ways to run giant corporations in more democratic and equitable ways. But you can't eliminate them.

	I'm inclined to say civilization IS guaranteed. But its quality is not guaranteed. A few nukes are not gonna kill civilization. Civilization is much more robust than people think. Even a massive nuclear war would not end it, just set it back.
</p>

<p>
	In the grand scheme of things the only thing that could end civilization is a large meteor strike or some massive freak natural event like a super-volcano or burst of solar radiation. Anything less than that will cause lots of suffering but not end civilization.
</p>

<p>
	The real question is how to reduce human suffering and how to elevate human consciousness in better way.

	They are good, just limited and partial. Stage Green politics can only take us so far. And from the perspective of truth, their worldview is not very truthful. And truth is mostly what I'm concerned about. But it's still better than right-wing worldviews and centrist worldviews.
</p>

<p>
	I look at things from a much higher perspective than most people care about. This comes with its pros and cons. The higher the perspective the less practical it can seem.

	It's amazing how good Morrowind looks today with full mod support. It's held up really well thanks to mods.
</p>

<p>
	I wish they'd hire a studio to do a full HD remaster with better combat improvements from Skyrim and larger dungeons.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of great games of yor need modern day remasters. Like Diablo 2.

<p>
	They developed such an awesome combat system but they barely give you enough enemies in the whole game to playtest it all. They needed to have way less story and puzzles and like 5x more enemy encounters. Then that game would be a 10/10 for me.
</p>

<p>
	I hate it when devs waste half their resources on story and puzzles that are not fun.

	The Divinity games are excellent, but they really screw up the last third of their games and they don't have enough enemies to fight. It's a shame. Too many dumb puzzles and not enough combat.

			FromSoft is my favorite game studio and one of primary inspirations for pursuing game development, so I couldn't help but grin at this. Sekiro might also be up your alley if you're in to the Souls series, and the Tokugawa era Japan setting was a nice change of pace for the studio. I might also recommend the Book of the New Sun series if the setting and mood of Dark Souls appeals to you, and if you're not put off by dense literary works.

			pretty accurate characterization of what's going on. thing is this is kinda an old unspoken agreement between gamers/devs that these big role playing games are going to launch broken as hell and then over time will be patched and completed. this agreement will go so far as to basically include one of the versions being totally unplayable but it's sold anyway and gamers are warned not to buy it. this is how it was with those bethesda fallout games and oblivion/skyrim. the playstation version was unplayable and it was basically your own fault if you decided to buy it. thing is though this was almost ten years ago and I think this won't fly today. especially for a game that was hyped up so much that it entered mainstream discussion and probably was the biggest game to drop since GTA V. times have changed. if you sell something it has to work. the cyberpunk situation is actually getting mainstream news coverage.  
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Every dev should have learned their lesson fron Fallout 76. But they didn't.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest facepalm here with Cyberpunk is that there zero need to rush the release. They would have sold even more units if they released it in 6 months. And their dev costs would have been no bigger. As it is now, CDPR will still be doing dev on this game for 6 full months into the summer. So they gained nothing but bad PR here and lost sales. Their investors were not even pressuring them to release. So this is just terrible executive biz strategy on their part.
</p>

<p>
	If they delayed this game another year, nothing bad would happen.

			What was wrong with Skyrim? I actually liked it much more than Oblivion and Morrowind. They took advantage of modern graphic software and engines to combine the beauty of Oblivion with the great gameplay of Morrowind. But yah curious about the next thing, unless Tod Howard decides to milk fallout series with another crappy multiplayer.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I enjoyed Skyrim a lot, but it just don't feel as good or deep of a world as Morrowind. It just doesn't have the same replayability and alien vibe.
</p>

<p>
	The mechanics and graphics and dungeons of Skyrim are great, but that magic of Morrowind is missing.
</p>

<p>
	And those fucking dragons! I will take cliffracers any day of the week.

	Yes, I have a book about Japanese monks in my book list. Do a CTRL+F search for the term "monks" and you'll see it.

		</p>

		<p>
			If life is a dream or an illusion, does physical reality exist or not? Is it just a projection of the ego mind or a projection of God's mind since this is "God's Dream"? Physical reality is and exists within' consciousness after all, right?
		</p>

		<p>
			When you say life is what Nothing looks like and feels like, then that implies physical reality exists?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not as a static objective thing.
</p>

<p>
	Physical reality exists in the same way that your dream realities exist. They exist when you are dreaming them.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to a movie. In a movie all that exist is what's visible in the current frame. There's no world behind the frame.

<p>
	Nothing applies to formless states of consciousness equally well as to formed states of consciousness.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I know what you're saying. Yes.
</p>

<p>
	What exists in that case is emptiness plus the idea of a non-existent apple.
</p>

<p>
	The key is to realize that non-existence is an idea, not an actual thing. Non-existence is imaginary. Consciousness is dreaming up non-existence!
</p>

<p>
	See, if God is the creator of everything, then God must also be the creator of non-existence. And so it is! If God wants non-existence he first has to dream it up. Don't just assume that non-existence exists by default. It doesn't! The default is Oneness, not twoness. And non-existence is twoness, since it's in duality with existence.

<p>
	Of course it's holonic. Which is why simplistic, one-sided political ideologies will never work. You need a complex, holistic, systems approach at the least.
</p>

<p>
	This is why I dislike Youtube progressives and Marxists. Their worldview is not holistic or integral enough to be true. And so it will keep failing.

I’m a keen gamer and just getting into this awakening path. As a result, I’m limiting my gaming somewhat - but am curious as to whether your awakening process has meant you’ve eliminated the activity entirely or do you still make time to play now & again?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't play nearly as much as in my early 20's. But I will make time to play once in a while if something great comes out.
</p>

<p>
	I have very high standards so rarely does something come out that I consider worth playing these days.
</p>

<p>
	But if a new Souls game comes out, I will beat it like a rented mule.
</p>

<p>
	You should cut back your gaming though if you're serious about awakening work. Only play the best stuff. Don't play average shit. Invest that time in awakening.
</p>

<p>
	No. A unicorn exists as a concept.
</p>

<p>
	But if you mean that thing the concept "unicorn" is supposed to point to, that exists as emptiness relative to planet Earth. But it could exist as a solid form because consciousness is unlimited. Just because no human has seen a unicorn doesn't mean it cannot be seen by consciousness.

<p>
	It's gotten so dumbed down and mainstream that the thing which made Elderscrolls great: Mirrowind, will never be repeated again. It's all downhill from here. Although I am looking forward to the next Elderscrolls. But I'm pretty sure they will dumb it down even more than Skyrim. Bethesda has sold its soul to the devil long ago. They don't understand what made Morrowind so special.

<p>
	The trope of women falling in love with their abusers is nothing new. Happens all the time. It's not offensive to say so. And the relationship between gamer fanboys and game publishers is almost the same dynamic on a psychological level. Fanboys love games, and game publishes know this and abuse them for it because they know the gamer is too addicted to leave.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Your intuition is correct.
</p>

<p>
	Existence has no opposite. Existence includes both something and nothing. Nothing is not non-existence. Nothing is existence.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness exists, as Nothing. Your entire life experience has been an experience of Nothing. Life is what Nothing looks like and feels like. The key mistake you've made is that you've assumed that life is not nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Life = Nothing. The end.
</p>

<p>
	What humans call "non-existence" is actually pure existence as emptiness. A non-existent object is simply the existence of emptiness. It exists! As emptiness. But you have confused this for non-existence.
</p>

<p>
	When your dog dies, it continues to exist. As emptiness. All that happens in death is the loss of form and a return to existence as emptiness. Nothing is ever really lost.

	Meh... Witcher 3 is way overrated.
</p>

<p>
	CDPR was way overrated, and now reality hits. They bit off more than they could chew with this game.
</p>

<p>
	Gamers are so gullible and easy to exploit. Just give a game a Bladerunner theme and Keanu Reeves, and you sell 8 million units overnight regardless of substance.
</p>

<p>
	And like an abused girl, gamers will eagerly come back for more abuse in 8 years. And so will the absued developers. They too will come back for more crunch. And so the industry churns on.

	If they reach that point, they've already screwed up badly. We don't just ban people willy-nilly here. To get banned usually requires many offenses or a single very serious offense.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry, but my time is limited and I'm not going to bend over backwards for people who get banned.
</p>

<p>
	In all my years banning people, I have never seen a single banned person who was willing to correct their behavior. Not one. Even if they are willing, they are simply constitutionally incapable of it and I am not going to wait around for them to grow up.

<title>Mod Abuse of Power,what should you do if you sense that a mod is biased against you?</title>

<p>
	I keep a close eye on Mods to make sure they are well-behaved. And for the most part we have an excellent Mod team here that requires little guidance from me.
</p>

<p>
	If a Mod repeatedly makes mistakes and shows poor judgment they will lose Mod status (which has happened once or twice in the past). I'm generally very careful about selecting Mods to begin with, so it really don't get much better than this. Don't forget, Mods are human. They will never be perfect. I'm not perfect either. Policing this forum is a lot of work and policing will always involve an element of subjectivity.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a problem with Mod behavior you can always contact me about it. But if you do, you better present a solid case with solid evidence of abuse. Just because a Mod issued you a warning you disagree with does not mean the Mod is abusing their power.
</p>

<p>
	This forum would be a hell-hole without all the work our Mods do (for free).
</p>

<title>Does an invitation to trip together imply sex?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/58759-does-an-invitation-to-trip-together-imply-sex/?do=findComment&amp;comment=794631</link>

<p>
	Order of operations in dating is crucial. If you trip with a girl for your first date, the order will be wrong and you will go too deep too fast and it will feel weird and creepy -- which is the last thing girls want.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to sleep with her, you need to dial back the depth and seriousness. Tripping is serious business. You should not be doing that on a first date. Your first dates must be light, playful, fun, and as low-investment as possible. A coffee.
</p>

<p>
	By setting up a trip date, you're actually being needy as fuck. Why are you sharing such depth with some girl you haven't even slept with??? It makes no sense. Because you're needy, that's why. And she will smell it off you and it will creep her out. Save the tripping for after you slept with her 5 or 10 times.
</p>

<p>
	Order. Of. Operations.
</p>

<p>
	Escalation. Ladder.
</p>

<p>
	Learn it and follow it.
</p>

<p>
	DO NOT FALL IN LOVE BEFORE YOU SLEPT WITH HER! It's creepy as fuck.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest way to turn a girl off is by being creepy and needy. And you're combining the two of them into the ultimate Incel combo.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If a girl not willing to agree to a coffee with you, she will never agree to do anything else with you. There is no lower investment ask than a coffee. If she won't agree to that, she just don't find you attractive and nothing you do will change that.
</p>

<p>
	Of course.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of dumb ideas within left-wing anarcho-communism that will never fly.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot have socialism with a tiny government because any tiny government will just be overpowered by a large corporation. And you cannot reduce the size of corporations if you want to maintain the complexity of modern technology, industry, and logistics chains.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that small government is just a pipe dream. Government will only get bigger, not smaller.
</p>

<p>
	Leftists who think you can have socialism + a small government don't understand how government or management works. The government must be the biggest organization in the world, otherwise you won't have peace.

	Trump admin advisors have publicly said months ago that their strategy is herd immunity. Nothing new here.
</p>

<p>
	They must take this approach because they are too incompetent at governance to actually manage the crisis. So they just take a libertarian free-market attitude. It's an every-man-for-himself approach -- which is their entire philosophy.

<p>
	I never said I got laid from that one. She had a boyfriend.
</p>

<p>
	You can def approach girls with headphones. Stop giving a shit. Stop making excuses. If you find her attractive you must approach even if she's with her mother. Stop thinking about how to approach and just approach automatically. Move your feet towards her. Your mind will struggle to keep up with your feet, and that's okay.

	Cyberpunk's visuals are better than their trailers and demos, on high end PC.
</p>

<p>
	You can find comparision videos of it on YT.
</p>

<p>
	They overdelivered on visuals. Unfortunatwlely the rest of the game seems to suck. They tried to make the cool visuals and theme carry the whole game, and of course that will not fly.
</p>

<p>
	Just like Bladerunner, the visuals are cool but the movie itself sucks. All surface, no depths.

<title>Can psychedelics be used to heal DPDR? Should those with DPDR avoid psychedelics?</title>

<p>
	It's a crap shoot. Psychedelics could make you even more ungrounded and depersonalized.
</p>

<p>
	There's no simple formula here. It could make things worse or it could make things better, depending on how you trip and how you make sense of your trips.
</p>

<p>
	I would not count on psychedelics being some magic cure.
</p>

<p>
	I used to give him that same benefit of the doubt. But his latest videos are pushing the apocalypse angle hard, just without using that word. It's quite irresponsible and bad.
</p>

<p>
	I don't even understand what the point of his teachings and ashram is if an apocalypse is truly coming. If there is a nuclear war the last thing people will care about is enlightenment or yoga. All of that requires a peaceful stable society.

<p>
	"Being yourself" is not about adopting some material identity. It's about discovering your authentic personality by removing all your fears and bad social conditioning.
</p>

<p>
	You are God, but your mind/body has a unique personality that requires discovery and alignment.
</p>

<p>
	Being a millionaire is not a personality trait. It's just a material condition.
</p>

<p>
	"Being yourself" is good advice. But you need to understand what it means. It's overly simplistic. There's a lot to it.

<p>
	He's def not a sociopath/psychopath or ill-intentioned.
</p>

<p>
	I have said before that his apocalyptic videos are not good. And he seems to be ramping them up lately. Trump and Covid have made his apocalyptic message seem more credible, but I say it's an illusion. Ain't no apocalypse coming. And if it is, you're fucked anyway so there's no point preparing for it.
</p>

<p>
	The people who follow him at the ashram are definitely sheep. I can confirm that much. And most/all of them ain't enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	But overall his nondual teachings are solid. Just don't listen to the Kali yuga stuff.

<p>
	Their meds are not mandated by government for 100 million+ people.
</p>

<p>
	Vaccines are not standard meds. And you cannot sue Big Pharma for normal side-effects to their drugs. You can only sue them for willful malfeasance. If you take some drug and it causes your eyes to bleed, but that's considered a known side-effect, you can't sue for that.

<p>
	Because vaccines are necessary for society to function and pharmaceutical companies are not going to continue doing things which are not profitable for them without incentives.
</p>

<p>
	Every drug has some % of side-effects. The difference is, no drug other than a vaccine is mandated for 100s of millions of people by the government. When you have a sample size of 100 million+, there will be some bad cases.

	There's no fundamental difference between your feet, ass, or thoughts. It's all objects within awareness. Thoughts are just more sneaky and seductive.

<title>Why doesn't the government tell us how to be healthy?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	For the government to tell you how to be healthy it must first understand holistic health, which it does not because our culture has not yet evolved to such a level. Government's approach to health is mostly stage Blue/Orange. Which means materialistic health strategies that avoid preventative and holistic health.
</p>

<p>
	Also, the government's biggest job is to keep people from dying, not to make them thrive. The government is there to go very basic stuff, not to lead you towards greatness. That's your own responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	From the government's POV it is not a viable solution to just hand out free supplements to people because Covid will still ravage half the population who are unhealthy, obese, and who will not stick to a consistent vitamin schedule even if their lives depended on it.
</p>

<p>
	Since most people are dumb, government's solutions must be such as to work for and scale for tens of millions of dumb and lazy people. They must also scale for poor people, since 1/3rd of the US is poor and cannot even afford stuff like vitamins or healthy foods.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously it's selfish. But more importantly it's unstrategic because your chances of getting harmed by Covid are higher than getting harmed by its vaccine. By refusing the vaccine your risks actually increase.
</p>

<p>
	So as usual, selfishness and fear tends to backfire.

<p>
	This is her mistake. Because no matter how much she holds this position, her body and mind still must survive in the relative world.
</p>

<p>
	Voting is pointless if you don't care about dying and suffering. But of course you care extremely much about dying and suffering. Even if you are enlightened you STILL care about minimizing the suffering of others.

	Yes, it is of course an illusion. But when illusion is all that can ever exist, this point isn't as strong as she thinks.

<p>
	This is a common trap, to conflate relative matters with absolute matters.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you understand nonduality does not mean that your mind will properly reason about society or politics.
</p>

<p>
	Telling spiritual people not to vote is extremely irresponsible and ignorant, no matter how enlightened you are. Enlightenment does not automatically grant sound political reasoning.

</blockquote>

<p>
	All survival happens in the relative domain.
</p>

<p>
	If you give up the relative domain, you must also give up survival. You can do that, but do you really understand the severity of what you're doing?
</p>

<p>
	When your child is being raped, are you gonna be okay with that? << Those are the real stakes here. That's what politics boils down to. It's very serious stuff. Contrary to what most people think, politics is about as serious a topic as there could be. It's all about life and death and suffering. Which is why people get so ideological about it. If it wasn't important people would not become political radicals.
</p>

<p>
	And the choice to do nothing, politically-speaking, is still a choice. So you cannot escape politics. Politics will happen regardless, even if you decided to ignore it.
</p>

<p>
	Basically she's being an ostrich sticking her head in the sand, hoping that someone else will solve all the political problems while she basks in the Absolute. Which is actually a selfish position.

<p>
	That's absurd. Faster CPUs require a new chassis with faster bus, better cooling, and other such factors. Not to mention that many devices are mobile and don't have space for modules.
</p>

<p>
	The old units don't need to be tossed in the trash, they can be recycled. And usually before that happens they are resold many times over. No one just throws a CPU in the trash. They resell it.
</p>

<p>
	The market is actually quite good as being efficient when it comes to stuff like this. Central planning such things would be less efficient and more wasteful.

It's not simply greed. The people who work at these companies actually care about stuff -- they are not robots or zombies. The days of those kinds of corporations that only cared about profits are coming to an end. Because it's not culturally sustainable. If you want to retain the most talented employees, they will have ethical concerns about things. It comes with the package.

	We are nowhere close to a slippery slope.

<p>
	Denying the results of a certified US Presidential Election is kinda a big deal if you care about maintaining democracy. These are not just some right-wing political videos. These are videos denying a Presidential Election that was not even close.

<p>
	The fact that we are even having a slippery slope debate about this is absurd and a victory for the devils on the right.

	If Big Tech called right-wing ideology a lie, the right wing would still be here crying and whining about how unfair and biased it is.

<p>
	The whole point of policing is that it's not enough to call a thief a thief, you have to ban him too. There must be consequences when people try to spread lies for profit and power.
</p>

<p>
	It's like, people understand the function of policing in the material world, but in the online work they think that policing doesn't need to happen and things will just magically go well. No. If you don't police online spaces criminals will take them over. Bad actors are always looking for entry points.

</p>

<p>
	It is ironic that those who cry about 1984 are in fact using 1984 to denounce YT for calling a lie and lie. Hence those who call YT "censorship" are in fact using the Newspeak and Doublethink of 1984.
</p>

<p>
	"Freedom of speech" is in fact Doublethink, invented by the devil so that that devil is free to keep spreading his lies. And any time someone calls out the devil's lies, he pulls out the Free Speech card. Classic gaslighting.

<p>
	You will never have total freedom to spread bullshit and lies without consequence in a healthy society.
</p>

<p>
	Censorship is when truthful things are banned by powerful people because it threatens their power. What YT did is not censorship, it's the policing of devilry. It's the same thing as contemporary Germany banning Nazi symbols and propaganda.
</p>

<p>
	A platform the size of YT will always have moderation and rules against misinformation.
</p>

<p>
	If the left wing starts to spread misinformation to the same degree and with the same reckless shamelessness as the right wing, then they too should be banned.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is the false equivalence drawn by right-wingers between right and left. They are not two equal but opposite sides. The right-wing lies much more and so they rightly get slapped more for it.
</p>

<p>
	If the right-wing cared about truthfulness even a bit, most of these "censorship" problems would disappear. But of course a liar does not like when his lies get called out or fact-checked.

			<strong>2)</strong> How can imaginary also be so tangible?
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Example:</strong> The ferocious dog is imaginary, and then I touch the imaginary dog, and it bites me. I have a deep wound on my leg. My leg is also imaginary. I feel the pain, though. There are tears - imaginary, as well.
		</p>

		<p>
			They feel like distinct episodes. How can I put it all into one coherent idea of imagination? Is it even possible to be that aware in everyday life? 
		</p>

		<p>
			I am not going to sit there laughing, right? - "Look, hahaha, an imaginary dog bit me and there's this random liquid oozing out of my body, but this liquid, color and the body is imaginary, and this sensation, which feels so real is also imaginary - fantastic."
		</p>

		<p>
			Well right now, my mind is, uh, to put it in the most eloquent sense - majestically fucked.
		</p>

		<p>
			I appreciate your insights.

<p>
	Since imagination is infinite, nothing can exist outside it, and there is nothing else you can contrast it with, so it becomes reality. Imagination is Absolute. "It's so tangible" is just one aspect of imagination. It can be tangible or intangible or an infinite number of other things.
</p>

<title>Age difference in a relationships</title>

<p>
	There's no problem per se with a 25 year old girl dating a 40 year old, because she's mature enough to be responsible for herself. So it's not the age difference that's the main problem here. The problem is that a girl who's 18-22 is immature as hell and doesn't know what she's doing.

		</p>

		<p>
			What about human expression through the means of procreation? Where would we fit that? Isn't procreation somewhere linked to the human desire for symbolic immortality, based on a myriad of emotions? 
		</p>

		<p>
			How would an enlightened person look at this? Why do most traversing the path towards enlightenment abstain from this - monks, etc.?

<p>
	You have to distinguish between the reasons for how that comes about. Girls have lots of one night stands simply from being highly social and because they get pumped and dumped by guys.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are misunderstanding enlightenment. It doesn't eliminate emotions, it allows you to feel them stronger and deeper, and appreciate them more.
</p>

<p>
	Unenlightened people express themselves in neurotic and dysfunctional ways because they are run unconsciously by based emotions related to fear.
</p>

<p>
	Conscious people express themselves more authentically, functionally, and creatively in alignment with Truth & Love.
</p>

<p>
	Creative expression is going to happen regardless because that's not a human quality, that's God's very nature. God is infinite creative expression. The closer you get to God, the more creative and powerful your expression will be.
</p>

<p>
	You should distinguish low consciousness emotions centered around fear and falsehood vs high consciousness emotions centered around Love & Truth.

<p>
	I'm not talking about incels or virgins or even number of sexual partners.
</p>

<p>
	It may very well be that women have more sexual partners on average than men.
</p>

<p>
	But women still don't employ a pump and dump strategy while men do.
</p>

<p>
	In general, since women socialize more they have sex more. If a guy socialized as much as the average girl, he'd get laid a lot more.

	Most women are not looking for casual encounters.

	Occasionally girls are out to have fun and purely get a one night stand, but this is an exception not the norm. Girl cannot afford to be perceived as a slut. It hurts her survival value too much.

	The reason men are content with less is because they will pump and dumb. When you pump and dump you could sleep with a hippo and be okay.
</p>

<p>
	Men are actually NOT content with less, they're just always angling for more.
</p>

<p>
	Since women don't employ the pump and dumb strategy nearly as much, of course they will be choosier.

<p>
	The problem is the extreme power imbalance which will lead to him abusing/exploiting her unless he is a saint. Which of course he is not because he's already playing devilish games with hiding his age. Only a devil would want to date a 19 year old to begin with. So obviously he's gonna exploit her and she's too young and dumb to understand that.
</p>

<p>
	Which is exactly why her parents would (correctly) freak out if they found out. You might as well tell them that their daughter is hanging out at the Playboy Mansion.
</p>

<p>
	Men will go to great lengths to scheme to get young girls.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing good will come of this. You might want to tell her parents because this dude could seriously traumatize her for a long time. Best case scenario he will just exploit her for sex and break her heart. Worse case scenario he will manipulate her so bad that she'll be in therapy for the rest of her life.
</p>

<p>
	There is no happy fairy-tale ending here. He will exploit her. You better act fast before she falls in love with him.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of dating a 19 year old is that he gets to exploit her. Like a cat playing with a mouse. It's obvious to anyone with some sense what this guy is doing.
</p>

<p>
	I am not interested in collaborations. I have my own work. Wilber has his own work. There is no need for us to collaborate.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like doing things which have no purpose of being done. I have enough work cut out for me for the next 20 years. Everything else for me is a distraction from that. My work is not going to get much better all the sudden from collaborating with someone. It will actually get worse. My work is not of the type that is done by a group of people. I'm not in the business of engineering rocket ships here. I am an intellectual and intellectuals do their best work solo. If I wanted to work in a group I would be making video games.

Then again, a college degree might be helpful here so why not get it if it's gonna help your work?
</p>

<p>
	The concern should not be about college, but about whatever is necessary to get good at your job. If that means college, then college it is. If that means some other way, then that's the way.
</p>

<p>
	There are so many different possible positions within the field of counseling people that you've got tons of different options.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you can become a hypnotherapist. This requires no college degree. A master in hypnosis can help many people.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking inside the box. There are at least 100 different ways you could carve out a niche for yourself in this field.
</p>

<p>
	And don't be afraid of college. You can find great psychology programs if you bother to look.

<p>
	You totally misinterperated what he said.
</p>

<p>
	He said, "The <u><strong>utility</strong></u> of your career (relative to family), maybe that peaks by the time you're 35 or 40 and then it starts to decline pretty rapidly".
</p>

<p>
	He was not talking about your career declining at all. He was talking about the relative <strong><u>utility</u></strong> (significance) of family, love, and children.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of older people have great careers that are peaking. That's not the issue. The issue is, will that career truly satisfy you?
</p>

<p>
	He was basically making the point that being a workaholic is not a good strategy for happiness. Which of course is true.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, having a bunch of kids is also not a good strategy for happiness. Most miserable people in the world probably have kids. JP has kids. Is he happy? Nope.
</p>

<p>
	Happiness is not a function of material conditions. And kids are a material condition.

	BTW, even though I said above that I have a policy of not engaging with reactionaries, I will still always be open to constructive feedback. I rarely get good constructive feedback, usually it's trolling type stuff which I ignore. But if I see genuine constructive feedback I will read it and take it into consideration since I do make mistakes and my ways of teaching can be improved.

	I have no interest in tearing him down. I am happy if he is doing his creative work and helping to popularize and educate about psychedelics. There is value in that and I want to morally support my fellow psychonaut pioneers. We psychonauts should not be fighting each other. We just need to recognize that we will have differences of perspective about psychedelics in the same way that spiritual teachers have differences in perspective about God.

<p>
	The thing is this: if Adeptus and I had a public talk to hash all this out, in the end all that would happen is that we would be talking past each other because we have relativistically different POV. These relativistic differences would not be resolved, and even if they were -- in the best case scenario -- all that would be revealed is a series of mutual misunderstandings. Nothing of substance would be revealed or learned.
</p>

<p>
	This is the nature of all debates and public feuds. They are debates about nothing. Just differences in perspective based upon difference in consciousness, experience, and various biases.
</p>

<p>
	So this kind of "spinning of wheels" is the kind of thing I wish to avoid with my creative energies. I see it all over YouTube and I have never seen anything that I value come out of it.

<p>
	Generally though, you will NEVER discover the truth via a conversation with someone else. All conversation is a distraction from spiritual practice. Which is why your ego craves it so much.

			Leo, you stated you would be interested in a public discussion and I (perhaps incorrectly, but I'm sure I am not alone here) interpreted that as you offering to have an on camera conversation - after all, our primary method of public broadcast is YouTube and that is where our collective audience is. That you expect me to engage with this forum rather than our common platform, and that you have ignored all my previous communications since your initial offer, makes the offer itself appear insincere and more like an attempt at damage control.

You are absolutely NOT responsible for Connor, but you are responsible for YOUR treatment of Connor - clearly you agree at least to some level, because you have stopped calling him an unhinged lunatic and started treating him like a human being. So NO, you are not expected to "support" Connor Murphy, but you are expected to not be a total arse to him just because he is parroting you. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The reason I reached out to him is: 1) Because I don't want him to hurt himself, and 2) Because I don't want him to give spirituality and psychedelics and Actualized.org a bad image. Yes, your video spurred me into taking these possibilities more seriously because in general I don't take people like Connor seriously unless I'm really forced to. I don't sit around watching people's spiritual videos. My attention is focused on my own work. When some posts a video mentioning me or criticizing me, I have zero interest in seeing it. My initial reaction is that it's a distraction. Any errors in my work will not be revealed to me by some YouTube reactionary, they will be found by myself. I don't need you to tell me where I'm deluded, I will find all those areas much deeper myself.
</p>

<p>
	I still hold to my initial statements:
</p>

<p>
	1) Connor is acting like an unhinged lunatic in the way he style his videos. Any casual observer with perceive him to be unhinged, regardless of whether this is true or not. I wanted to speak to Connor to find out if he's actually unhinged in person. My conversation with him was healthy and reasonable. I wish he came off that way in his videos so people don't get the wrong idea. But he told me he deliberately plays up the crazy for purpose of views and clicks. To me that's a waste of my time. This entire "controversy" is basically nothing but clickbait drama. Which is why I don't usually respond to such things. It's a distraction from serious spiritual work. I generally don't like it when people create controversy and drama just for attention because this seriously distracts my audience from the deep work they should be focused on doing. I am protective of my audience's attention. I don't want it directed towards dramatic stuff like Connor's Tantric sex. It's a waste of time.
</p>

<p>
	2) I still hold that Connor is a Zen devil. I have an old video: Becoming A Zen Devil, where I explain many of the traps Connor is falling into.
</p>

<p>
	My treatment of Connor was fine considering that I try to keep my focus on my own work and not the work of others. When a guy comes off as unhinged I don't give that person much of my attention. That's what happened. Then your video made me rethink the situation and get involved. I generally don't like getting involved in such things because it's usually not constructive or productive.

			2. The disconnect of YOU calling Connor an "unhinged lunatic", for saying almost word for word the EXACT same things you say is utterly absurd.

<p>
	No, he is not saying the same things I am saying. Not at all. I have never engaged in clickbait with my channel. I do the opposite of clickbait and it costs me millions of views and $$$. So to compare my teachings with Connor is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	Just because Connor says basic spiritual truths such as "I am God" or "Life is a dream" or "Do psychedelics" does not mean his teachings are the same as mine. Those a common spiritual truths which many spiritual teachers say. What matters is the other 95% of the teaching.

			3. I fully appreciate that going through a process on camera is messy, and when framed as a subjective stream of thought then I have zero complaint with that. My issue is that doing so WITHOUT that proper framing is irresponsible, and both you and Connor are making the same mistakes here. Sure we all say strange things as we go through our process, but your "I'm leaving video" makes many statements framed as objective fact - and not to state the obvious, but you made this video BEFORE your 30 days of 5MEO. So NO you weren't recovering from 30 days of 5MEO breakthrough... unless of course we are adding time travel to your list of abilities?

<p>
	My leaving video was recorded after a massive breakthrough in consciousness facilitated by 5-MeO-DMT, which is why I left to do the 30 day retreat. I was also going through a very challenging health situation.

All my criticisms and footage I have ever shown are specific to the "I'm leaving" video which I have stated many times, and I try not to get bogged down in the numerous "Look what Leo has done now!" requests I receive. I think the fact that you are bundling it into this situation and getting defensive about it, probably says more about how YOU feel about that "5MEO in the bath" video.

	Firstly, there were no "antics". I just sat in a bath. That's it. That's what you call "antics".

<p>
	Secondly, I thought you had an issue with my taking a bath on 5-MeO-DMT. I know some YouTube reactionary did, I guess that wasn't you but someone else. I confuse you with that someone else. My bad and my apologies.

			If you want my opinion on it - then I think setting up a laptop in the bathroom for the explicit purpose of watching porn and masturbating in the bathtub while high, is simply an indication that you have an unresolved porn addiction rather than an expression of supreme spirituality. But hey - whatever rocks your boat dude.

<p>
	Addiction is your assumption. I never said anything about addiction. It was a spiritual experience, and an amazing one that you only wish you had. To become fully conscious of what sexual desire is, is a profound awakening. And to give yourself the sexual pleasure you desire is also a profoundly healing spiritual experience.

			5. Yes I am white knighting Connor, because sometimes people need a white knight. One can only assume that on some level you agree, because you did a 180, stopped making derogatory comments about Connor, reached out to him, and now everyone seems happier for it. This is the beauty of peeking outside of the echo chamber once in while, because sometimes the position you have needs to be challenged. Now that job is done I can ride my white horse home.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Calling Connor a Zen devil was a precise articulation of his problem. My comments were derogatory in the same way that anyone new watching some of Connor's unhinged videos would react. BTW, I withheld commenting or judging Connor for many months. People have been posting his videos here since last spring and I withheld judgment even though in the back of my mind I already saw that this guy was a troublemaker and a potential distraction. I only called him an unhinged lunatic after enough of his videos were posted here and your video linking him to me was the straw that broke the camel's back.
</p>

<p>
	I toned down my language so that I could reach out to Connor and find some common ground to try to persuade him not to go down the road of Zen devilry. If he continues making unhinged clickbait videos, my initial opinions of him will stand. I want to give him some space to correct himself.

			6. I have never questioned whether you are, or are not God, nor stated that you claim God is exclusive to you. This is a strawman of my criticism, so allow me to clarify. My criticism simply revolves around the abilities you claim can be unlocked by having had the God awakening - an awakening which according to YOU, you have gone through multiple times. My argument is simply that such abilities are completely delusional bullshit, along with the various ego inflations which seem to accompany it.
		</p>

<p>
	Such abilities are not delusional bullshit. But these abilities require serious spiritual practice to actualize. A psychedelic trip alone will not grant these abilities in the sober state. This is still something I'm researching and figuring out.

			I don't want to go through the entire video blow by blow, but here is one of your direct quotes to accurately highlight my position, and how your statements are being framed as objective fact rather than fluffy poetic subjective interpretations (see point 3 above)
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong><em>"I can help you to discover that you are God. When you do realize that you are God, this will instantaneously solve every single problem in your life, not only that but it will heal you, it will heal you of every disease and problem that you have"</em></strong>
		</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That particular statement was overstated, to be fair to you. And I can see why that would arouse skepticism in people like you.
</p>

<p>
	Nevertheless, deep consciousness can indeed resolve and heal many problems in your life. It's not a magic cure for everything. Some problems need to be fixed at the material level. So I will concede that point to you. I exaggerated with that statement. I do have tendency to exaggerate and overstate things sometimes in order to communicate the depth and profundity of these remarkable states of super-human consciousness. Sober words don't really do these states justice.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is that everything that I said about spirituality, consciousness, and psychedelics is a gross understatement. I have accessed states of consciousness which are absolutely beyond anything that could be explained or taught, or that has been accessed by traditional teachers. Doubt me if you like, but I don't care. In these states of consciousness literally every problem is resolved. The problem is how to sustain such consciousness. That's the only real problem.

			Now as for all the various claims about psychic powers, nonduality, what all this means - that's something we could get into if you ever want to ACTUALLY ENGAGE with me, but I'm not going to spend any more time on this forum than need be. I signed up purely for the reason to take you up on your offer for a public conversation, but if that offer is no longer there or that I misconstrued it then this account is of no use to me. Forum based back and forths are often petty and unproductive, and I think you of all people know this, so why you would suggest it as an appropriate medium for a discussion like this is baffling - again it just reeks of the insincerity of the original offer.
		</p>

		<p>
			My offer for a conversation is still there, and as I think this whole debacle has perfectly highlighted - sometimes its good to be challenged. That challenge works both ways, and make no mistake about it Leo - you could certainly challenge me, and I think we could have a fascinating conversation. Despite how you might read my admittedly snarky and blunt comments, I have said many times that I greatly respect what you have achieved here with Actualized, and that you have done some superb work with great insights. I sincerely tip my hat towards you and encourage you to stick your head above the trench-line, because the greater conversation around psychedelics and consciousness will happen anyway - just without you. This is somewhat tragic because I think you have valuable contributions to make to the discourse that is happening OUTSIDE of Actualized, if you could just pull your head out of your own arse and be prepared to accept a few bruises to your ego.

<p>
	I get very little out of engaging with you. It takes up time which I could invest in creating better videos.
</p>

<p>
	I have a general policy not to engage with any reactionary material to my work. Now, of course, my critics will chalk that up to the fact that my positions are too weak to be defended in public debate. But the reality is that the things I teach cannot be debated at all. So I don't debate and I don't react. I don't really do interviews either. Because I want all my attention to be focused on constructive work.
</p>

<p>
	My policy has always been not to engage reactionaries. I made a rare exception for your video because Connor has a large audience and I don't want them to get misled about this work, and also because I became somewhat concerned about Connor's psychological health. Your video did make me take this issue more seriously, as I initially dismissed the seriousness of the situation. Because my mind is not focused on anyone's work but my own. So some thanks to you for that. If a see some crazy YouTuber doing something, I generally have no interest in butting in. I got my own work to focus on.
</p>

<p>
	This whole incident, thanks your video, has made me even more convinced that in the future I will not be responding to any reactionary YouTube content about me. And that is because nothing of value comes from it. I will not do debates and I will not defend any of my teachings. My teachings will stand completely on their own merits. My teachings are true only if you can validate them for yourself. Anything that comes out of my mouth which you cannot validate is not true. Which makes things very simple. My teachings are not an ideology of any kind and therefore they require no defending or debate. You cannot discover the truth of my teachings via a conversation, discussion, or debate. You cannot know whether miraculous healing is possible from super-human states of consciousness via discussion on YouTube. The only way to solve that is to actually do it.
</p>

<p>
	I thank you for your willingness to engage in a public conversation, but I would rather focus my time and energy towards creating positive new content rather than distracting my audience with drama, gossip, and controversy.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that I'm saying you're wrong, either. Even if you are right, I will let the audience make that determination for themselves while I move on with doing my constructive work. But I simply have no interest in publicly adjudicating rightness or wrongness. A much faster way to adjudicate that is through actual practice. Practice is what will cut out all the falsehood. If you are right and I am wrong, practice will show that. So I would rather just direct my audience to practice more.

Yes we talked about you and, with some obvious caveats, we both reiterated that we appreciate your work.

			One final point I would like to address is more to your fans who seem entirely obsessed with the notion that "I am here to cash in by milking the Leo cow". I find comments like this about views and subs to be extremely lame, but since I am already here and we are having a reality check then lets roll with this.
		</p>

		<p>
			Out of 102 videos I have made then 3 are about Leo (its really more like 2.5 since this last one is more about Connor Murphy, but lets round it up to 3). None of those 3 are anywhere close to my best performing videos - so NO, Leo is not a cash cow. My best performing videos are all related to substances (DMT, 5MEO, Amanita), so if we must use such crude analogies then SUBSTANCES are the cash cow by ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Okay, good for you. In general I have a very low opinion of YouTubers who make their careers as reactionaries. If that's not you, then great. I wish you a long and happy career as a constructive content creator rather than a troll.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe at some point in the future we could have a public conservation, but right now my focus is on deepening my own practice. I'm not even much interested lately in being a YouTuber. Very soon most of my focus will be going into my own radical awakening and spiritual practice. When I do my deepest work you will not even know that I exist.
