<p>
	For this issue you'd be better off visualizing yourself having multiple orgasms.
</p>

<p>
	Women can have powerful orgasms simply through strong visualization with no physical stimulation.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate how powerful your mind is.
</p>

<p>
	Of course this is no substitute for having the right partner.

	No one said you have to own it. You are simply being told to do the practices. Why you gotta "own it"?

</p>

<p>
	There will always be geo-political tensions. The deeper question is, should national economies be more fair and less skewed towards unchecked greed, wage slavery, and profit?
</p>

<p>
	Pretty obvious that a conscious economy would be more fairly distributed, with high taxes on massive and needless wealth.

			I tend to agree, and yet if I'm really honest, I don't know. No one can know. When you do your practices and awakening happens, to say the practices helped is just a belief. You can never ever know that. Even this belief is reinforcing the illusion of separation. It's infinitely tricky. I'm not saying don't do the practices. But to think it's possible to manipulate reality for it to realize what it already is IS EGO ITSELF. As long as you think you can understand or manipulate the Absolute, you distance yourself from it. And I see this trap being tapped in here again and again. And I see it in myself as well. Might be worth taking into account. Maybe this is one of the tricks you still can't surrender.

	You guys engage in far too much guesswork.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than playing games, go for what is in direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	This desire for guesswork goes against the spirit of awaking up.

<p>
	There are many levels of growth. The highest levels cannot be reached while manipulating.
</p>

<p>
	Most people never encounter this limit because they never grow that high.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate why you manipulate. And then surrender your need to stay alive or the need to meet any of your desires. Imagine a life where you stop caring what happens to you. Now manipulation has become unneccessary.

	There are definitely steps the ego can take to increase the chances of awakening. That is the whole point of spiritual practices.

Lots of different people out there. Don't fall into the myth of thinking they are all the same. There is someone out there who will appreciate what you got to offer.
</p>

<p>
	Your love is a virtue, so don't doubt that. But do have some boundaries so people don't exploit you.
</p>

<p>
	And also, silent love alone is not enough. You gotta work on your communication and your relationship skills. Conscious relationships take work. Issues will always arise. You gotta pre-empt them, talk them out, and clear the air on a regular basis.
</p>

<p>
	If you are at stage Turquoise you need a partner up near that level. Don't be expecting a stage Blue or Orange partner to work for you. Green and up for you. Your values must be aligned. Find yourself a chick who's into yoga or something like that.

<p>
	That is one of the problems.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically you'd need some kind of grain substitute like rice. But eating grain makes me feel bad because it's high in carbs and causes a sugar crash. It not particularly healthy either.
</p>

<p>
	Grain is basically empty sugar calories.
</p>

<p>
	Potatoes are one option. But again, it's mostly empty sugar calories.
</p>

<p>
	My body feels best on a diet of meat, veggies, fruits, and quality fats. Low carbs as possible.
</p>

<p>
	Juicing fruit and veggies is great for health. But you can't rely on it to keep you full.

<title>Sports as a Spiritual Pursuit</title>

<p>
	The practical problem is that with professional sports your body can give out at any time and ruin your entire LP. And this happens all too often.
</p>

<p>
	If by sports you mean coaching others, of course that's more practical. But then again, what is really the point of competitive sports? It's rather mindless. I guess I have a bias against it. It just doesn't make sense to me to devote your life to throwing balls into baskets. But hey, it's your life. Do WTF you want.

<p>
	Do you actually create them? Or do you just re-sell them? That's a big difference.
</p>

<p>
	There can be all kinds of interesting business opportunities in creating innovative new types of homes. But this has little to do with real-estate. This is more of a technology and design challenge.
</p>

<p>
	The reason real-estate re-selling is so competitive is because there's no creative value in it. You're adding very little to society by flipping properties. It's basically just an easy way to make money so every fool wants in. Do something that requires more skill, more art, more design, more intelligence.

<title>How honest can you be?</title>

<p>
	There's nothing honest about that. Plenty of people care.
</p>

<p>
	Counselors are supposed to be trained to handle situations like that. This is what basic life coach training is for.
</p>

<p>
	Being gay is a great thing and there's nothing depressing about it. A good counselor would help her client reframe the situation and see it in a loving and truthful manner.
</p>

<p>
	If a client hates himself, that's not honest or truthful, that's falsehood and delusion. The coach's job is to show him the error of his thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like your counselor friend needs better training and a deeper understanding of consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	Many counselors and coaches deeply care about their clients.
</p>

<p>
	How you reply to such a thing is you guide the client's mind out of his delusional thinking by getting him to become more conscious of how his mind is creating this negative meaning. It's not about saying something positive to cheer him up. It's about helping him discover the Truth! -- which is that all is Love.
</p>

<p>
	Self-hatred is a misuse of the mind.
</p>

<title>Chilean Dictatorship red blue or orange?</title>

<p>
	Red/Blue
</p>

<p>
	All of South America (especially back in the 20th century) was not yet at solid Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, it's easy to tap a bit into a higher stage like Orange. It's a lot harder to become solid in that stage. South America is still deeply Blue. They got a lot of work to do to reach solid Orange.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful to distinguish pockets of Orange in elite neighborhoods within developed cities vs the bulk of the country, which is rural, poor, or underdeveloped. The stage of a country cannot be judged by its peak elite neighborhoods in its biggest cities. You need to take a representative sample all around the country. It's too easy to cherrypick a few advanced neighborhoods while the rest of the country is an underdeveloped swamp.
</p>

<p>
	Beverly Hills, San Francisco, and NYC are not an accurate measure of the development level of average Americans.
</p>

<p>
	Since Truth and Love are identical and absolute, of course they are for their own sake.
</p>

<p>
	What are you gonna do, pursue Truth & Love for the sake of money, sex, or fame? That makes no sense. Truth & Love are superior to all the above because they transcend and include all the above. Once you have Truth & Love there's nothing else left for you to want. All wanting is a lack of Truth & Love.

	Bhakti yoga is one specific path. There are many paths to God & Love. It's not exclusive to Bhakti yoga. Follow whichever path resonates with you most.

He already desires it. I merely told him to not be lazy about his desire.
</p>

<p>
	If he wants to drop the desire, by all means, go right ahead and drop it. But does he really want to drop it?
</p>

<p>
	Either desire a thing and pursue it, or do not. If you waffle in the middle, expect hell.
</p>

<p>
	A common trap of this work is to get so metaphysical and existential as to avoid following through on the basics of human life. It's pretty simple really, if you're a human, you want to fuck. Best to embrace that rather than deny it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't like people pretending that they are above sex when they really aren't. You are only above sex when you genuinely no longer desire it.

<p>
	To the contrary, the rise of Trump has pushed America and Democrats much more left.
</p>

<p>
	Obama was pretty centrist and things like Medicare For All, Green New Deal, and rejection of corporate money was unthinkable 5-10 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	America is steadily moving left-er. Which is precisely what Trumpism is a reaction against. The core fuel behind Trumpism is that America is moving left and they cannot stand to admit that this is the correct direction to go, so they act like stubborn jackasses. The jackassery makes them feel morally righteous and avoid admitting deep flaws in their worldview.
</p>

<p>
	It all revolves around not wanting to change one's worldview due to it supporting a fictitious identity.
</p>

<p>
	Never forget, in the long-run things are always getting better, moving towards more consciousness, unity, and love. The evil which sprouts up along the way is part of the ulitmate flowering of Love.
</p>

	Brexit is the analog of Trump's boarder wall with a mote with snakes and crocodiles.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that both moves are a fear-based contraction of consciousness and will come with accompanying karma.

<p>
	As the Buddha wisely pointed out 2500 years ago, all desire leads to suffering.
</p>

<p>
	This problem is much broader than you realize.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, stop being lazy and go get a date.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing worse than desire is a desire that you are lazy about.

	You're not realizing that there is no difference between being in the movie and not.

<p>
	There is nowhere else for me to go because everywhere is already nowhere and nothing.

<p>
	You are imagining the difference between something and nothing, thereby creating reality.

<p>
	I am in the movie because you imagine I am. You are creating me, but you're in denial about it because if you admit you created me, you would also have to admit you created yourself.

	Reality is nothing. It never did exist. You only tricked yourself into thinking it did.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is an infinite trick.

<p>

	It's like you're a child asking why do movies have to be fake, why don't they stop all the fakery? Without understanding that without the fakery there would be nothing left.

<p>
	You can gather evidence from other people, but ultimately you have no idea if it will pan out until you try it for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to spend 50 years doing witchcraft. It would be wise to read a few books about it just so you understand what witchcraft is. You don't even know what the practice of witchcraft entails. You are rejecting something you haven't even researched for 5 hours.
</p>

<p>
	If you were serious about understanding reality you would be curious: "Why do people practice witchcraft? What does it get them?" This line of inquiry would yield some good fruit. But you haven't done it.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you will have to make educated guesses as to where to look.
</p>

<p>
	But what you absolutely must understand is that your guesses are biased, circular, and often wrong.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be willing to admit your wrongness, bias, and circularity to yourself.

<p>
	Absolute Truth is not a concept and cannot ever be communicated.
</p>

<p>
	You do not know if what the Buddhists say is true. Lots of people say lots of stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You must discover Truth for yourself, without reliance on any human sources or language.
</p>

<p>
	It is NOT safe to assume that Truth can be written down or even thought.

<p>
	You don't know what the Truth is. But it is possible to know.

<p>
	You are missing something very, very, very BIG!

	Some things can only be learned the hard way.
</p>

<p>
	A closed mind cannot be changed until it decides to open up by suffering the consequences of its closedness.
</p>

<p>
	Convincing a girl to leave a guy who's not right for her is like trying to discuss Greek philosophy with a mule. None of your logic matters.

<title>The Strict Rationalist's Justification for Nondualism &amp; Philosophical Implications</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/41418-the-strict-rationalists-justification-for-nondualism-philosophical-implications/?do=findComment&amp;comment=516853</link>

<p>
	You're welcome to play such philosophical games all you want. But Truth does not depend on any kind of justification. All of your justifications come after the fact.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Truth does not contradict rationality per se. But it sure does transcend it.
</p>

<p>
	"The supreme function of reason is to show man that some things are beyond reason." -- Blaise Pascal
</p>

<p>
	All of your reason and induction is indirect. Truth is prior to all that. Truth is even prior to perception. Reason is going to slow you down from reaching Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that your problem is that you don't want to let reason go. Ironically, you are irrationally attached to reason. So what's the solution? Let it go! Just let it go.
</p>

	If you camp out near the beach in Hawaii that can be basically free.
</p>

<p>
	Food is pricey in Hawaii though. But if you wanted to go real cheap you could live off rice/bread/junk food.
</p>

<p>
	Tickets to Hawaii cost $800-$1000 from West Coast.

Forget the lofty metaphysical stuff for now, and enough watching theory. Now it's implementation time.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately there can be no shortcut for doing your pushups. You just gotta bite the bullet amd start doing them, one baby step at a time. Gradually build up your momentum.
</p>

<p>
	Yew, this work takes lots of work. Accomplishing your highest vision requires a lot of hustling.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe see my video: How To Get Shit Done. You have to be results oriented, not just theortical.
</p>

<p>
	Also see my video: Balancing Theory vs Practice.
</p>

<p>
	You are stuck in a cycle of avoiding emotional labor and there's just no advice that can let you skirt that. You cannot grow up and become successful without emotional labor.

<p>
	Game companies have gotten a lot greedier and more exploitative in the last ten years. Few games are made for the artistry any more.
</p>

<p>
	Of course indie gaming has also taken off in the last 10 years, which was great!
</p>

<p>
	Online distribution has allowed for more exploitation. With great power comes great responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	Companies like EA, Activision, Ubisoft, BioWare, Bungie, Blizzard, and Bethesda have sold their soul to the devil because they became too successful for their own good. The money corrupted the art and they will never produce the same kind of great art they once did.
</p>

<p>
	Look to small, new companies for art. You are not going to find art at McDonalds.
</p>

<p>
	So glad I exited the industry in 2008 when all this horse armor stuff began.
</p>

<p>
	I had a phone interview with Todd for working on Fallout 3 but it didn't pan out.

<p>
	There is no practical way to verify anyone's age online.
</p>

<p>
	Moreover, this is a public forum. If someone wants to view it, they cannot be stopped.

<p>
	Sounds like you got some special genetics.
</p>

<p>
	How your body metabolizes chemicals depends on your genetics.
</p>

<p>
	I'm unusually sensitive, for example. You are the opposite.

<p>
	Yes, I have removed about 20-30 books which over time I felt didn't meet my quality standards. I replaced those books with better books.
</p>

<p>
	Quality is more important than quantity in this case. There are far too many books around which will waste your time.
</p>

<p>
	As I become more conscious my quality standards rise and I'm less tolerant of low-consciousness books.

<p>
	Obviously he wasn't anywhere near awakened, but his heart was in the right place and he was drawn intuitively towards Love, which resulted in his entire career and sense of life purpose. He's a great example of someone boldly following their LP.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people following their LP intuitively simply because it feels right, without an deeper existential understanding of why they're doing it. That's a fine way to get started. Later, existential understanding and consciousness work can be added on top of that to take your LP to crazy levels.

<p>
	No, it's deeper than that. The entire self/other distinction is imaginary. There is no one in the universe but yourself. By this I mean, you are the entire universe and all "others". Universal Mind imagines your body and all other bodies into existence.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: What Is Reality?

<p>
	That accounts for the mystical experience you were talking about. A mystical experience is an intuitive groking.

			The problem is the skeptic will claim that even after taking the psychedelic and being convinced of whatever mystical truth he might simply have been tricked due to the limitations of his brain. He might say that once he has the mystical experience he will be utterly convinced of it, which is why he must avoid it to stay objective.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, of course. This is an example of paradigm lock. Since you are God, if you take your own ideas seriously enough, you will get stuck in your mind until you die.
</p>

<p>
	So the solution to this kind of skepticism is death.
</p>

<p>
	There are a million different ways the mind can lock itself into an ideology from which it cannot escape other than through physical death. No amount of reason will solve this problem because reason itself is the problem.
</p>

<p>
	The skeptic must intuitively grok that skepticism is untruthful and biased. If he fails to grok this, he's fucked and nothing can save him.
