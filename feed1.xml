Police use overwhelming force in order to make sure people don't fuck with them. Which maintains the peace you enjoy.
</p>

<p>
	If you pull out a gun in a public area, you should expect to get shot by police. This is not inhumane. But obviously the police need to be well-trained not to use excessive force, especially against minorities. But if someone is waving a gun around in public, shooting him is not inhuman. If he has no gun, then he shouldn't be shot but tazered.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so complicated. It just requires good police training and accountability.
</p>

Most enlightened people just sit around and do nothing. You don't see enlightened people in the military or police force or 99% of other basic jobs.
</p>

<p>
	If everyone got enlightened tomorrow, society would completely collapse, worse than a nuclear war.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, enlightened people depend on the rest of society functioning unconsciously, in the same way that the police depend on criminals committing crimes.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment does have a certain elitism to it. It cannot really work unless society is advanced enough to support it. Or unless you are totally off on your own living in a cave. But even then you need someone to bring you food.
</p>

<p>
	In practice what happens is that an enlightened person is so rare the he can survive off his followers and fans.
</p>

<p>
	And also, in practice, if you are conscious enough to not suffer, you will be resourceful enough not to place yourself into a job where you have to shoot people.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, you can still probably be an enlightened police officer if you really wanted. I don't see why that necessarily requires suffering. There's no real contradiction shooting a bank robber. You shoot him because he's breaking an important law. Your job in this case is to defend society against devils, which ultimately helps society to awaken.
</p>

<title>How to survive whilst working towards life purpose?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/33841-how-to-survive-whilst-working-towards-life-purpose/?do=findComment&amp;comment=408962</link>

</p>

<p>
	There is no easy answer. Becoming financially comfortable whilst starting from scratch is very challenging, requiring creative thinking, strategy, focus, discipline, hard work, vision, and a bit of luck.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you will have to claw your way to the top using whatever means available.
</p>

<p>
	One very helpful piece of advice is to keep your living expenses as low as humanly possible. At least for the first 5 years of your LP, until you get established.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is to move to a very cheap part of the country, or even a 3rd world country as you develop your skills. Again, this is to keep your expenses as low as possible and buy yourself time to build skills.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is first build some more marketable skills which can help you pay the rent. For example it's possible to learn some programming skills, which tend to be well-paid.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is to work a relatively high-wage job for a year or two in order to save up a nest egg. There are some jobs which require zero experience and zero education but still pay well.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is to get a lower job but within your chosen field/industry. For example if you want to direct movies, rather than trying to get hired as a director (which is virtually impossible), try to get hired as an assistant to the director. Then you can prove yourself to the director and he might be willing to hire you in the future as a producer. Etc. Finally then you will become a director.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is to get a part-time job which allows you time to work on building your skills at home.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be very creative, opportunistic, and flexible when starting out.
</p>

<p>
	I spent 4 years building an entirely unrelated business to earn enough money to finally follow my LP. It was a huge detour and not at all easy or pleasant. But it was worth it.
</p>

			But how can you do all of that without suffering. Believing the thought ‘someone needs to be stopped’ by definition creates suffering. Fighting anything internally creates suffering. You can fight it externally, as long as you do not fight it internally. Are you saying we can’t survive without suffering?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Suffering IS a survival function. The only reason anything suffers is because it cares to survive.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering can be transcended through consciousness at the individual level, but at the collective level that's another story.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you framing it as "someone needs to be stopped"? You can act against devilry without being attached to it, and hence avoid suffering.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying you need to fight anything internally.
</p>

<p>
	I can vote against Trump without hating him. I can be conscious that he is me, but that he must still not be allowed to hold power. I can support the existence of a police department without suffering simply by understanding that police is needed for a decent society. This just requires some understanding of how government works.
</p>

<p>
	You can work to build a decent government without becoming an ideological partisan zealot about it.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, anything that can be done with suffering and attachment can also be done without suffering or attachment.
</p>

<p>
	You seem to be conflating action and education with suffering.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When the rubber hits the road, you will run crying to government to save your ass from the devils who want to rape you.
</p>

<p>
	The people who take government for granted are the ones who already feel totally safe because government has provided them with that safety without them even being aware of it.
</p>

<p>
	That's how good government is. It's amazing! Like magic!

</p>

<p>
	So you can act too cool for school, but that's only because someone else has worked their ass off to create a police force so that you can sit comfortably it your room without getting your throat slit.
</p>

<p>
	Survival demands action of you. If you are okay with dying, fine. Then you will die. See ya in the next life.
</p>

<p>
	Do not take government for granted. Without a good government you would be a slave. And good government does not happen by accident. It requires intense battle and effort against devils who would wish to enslave you.

</p>

<p>
	Start with a small dose and slowly work your way up.
</p>

<p>
	Any psychedelic can produce ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really prepare for it. It will just blindside you, you'll be dead before you realize what just happened. And then you will laugh as you realize death is a joke.

This is pathological Zen devilry.
</p>

<p>
	You are shirking your responsibilty as a creator. Nothing needs to happen, but that doesn't mean we cannot decide to execute Hitler for being a vicious devil.
</p>

<p>
	We get to decide how we want life and society to unfold. If you want to sit back and do nothing, that's fine, but that is your choice. Do not act like you are not making a choice. By not making a choice you've made your choice.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever choice we make becomes God's will.
</p>

<p>
	Reality makes things happen through YOU! Not for you. If you choose to not prepare for winter, winter will come and you will starve to death. Reality will not magically feed you. Reality gave you enough smarts to not be so stupid as to ignore winter.
</p>

<p>
	You are exhibiting a dangerous level of naivete.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality does NOT mean inaction or indifference.
</p>

<p>
	To escape personal suffering into some Nirvanic formless state and then to act like nothing else matters because you are free of suffering is perhaps the highest form of Zen devilry I have seen.

</p>

<p>
	If something is true, it is happening in your experience and you can observe it happening.
</p>

<p>
	So all you really have to do is look at what is actually happening without adding your own stuff to it.
</p>

<p>
	The tricky part is that you add A LOT of your own stuff to it.

<p>
	There is no formulaic answer.
</p>

<p>
	It's a delicate tight rope act. Following one's heart and intuition is a good rule of thumb. But that already assumes you've got a pure heart and good intuition, which not all people have.
</p>

<p>
	Mostly I keep myself safe by cross-referencing 100s of diverse sources and by understanding that my mind is self-deceptive.

			Is flow state a quasi 'mystical experience'?
		</p>

		<p>
			Whenever I get into flow (usually in high stake situations in sports, adventure sports etc) I will think right after the experience 'holy shit how did I manage to do that?' 
		</p>

		<p>
			Then I wonder-where did the 'I' go during that moment? My sense of self dissapeared for the duration and it it felt like time stopped...its quite difficult to subjectively explain the feeling because its so foreign.
		</p>

		<p>
			Hence, I was wondering if this is a glimpse into no-mind. How does flow state relate to nonduality?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is some similarity but it is also not really a mystical or nondual experience at all. You are still deeply unconscious in a flow state.
</p>

<p>
	It is similar in the sense that the sense of I is gone and thoughts are gone. But awakening is much more radical.
</p>

<p>
	Flow state shows you how nice it feels to not have ego controlling your life. But it gives you no understanding of what reality, Self, or God is.
</p>

<p>
	No, almost the opposite. 
</p>

<p>
	All that nonduality requires is to shut off the mind and sit in silence and concentrate for long periods of time.

<p>
	Concepts and thinking are the #1 obstacle.
</p>

<p>
	Sitting in silence and not thinking is not so easy if you are addicted to thinking (which everyone is).

</p>

<p>
	These things cannot be argued at you. You must take responsibility to contemplate them on your own.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to understand what 2+2=4 means, start by contemplating: What is a number? What is equality? What is truth?
</p>

<p>
	These are questions which takes years to contemplate.
</p>

<p>
	The greatest mathematicians on the planet do not understand such things. It cannot be explained to you in a forum post. This is very serious stuff. Argument, proof, and reason count for virtually nothing here because all of those have been co-opted by ego.
</p>

<p>
	If you truly understood what a number is, or what truth is, it would collapse your entire reality.

<p>
	You can't understand that at your current stage of development and consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	At your stage of cognitive development you simply take objective reality for granted, as a given. But there actually isn't such a thing.
</p>

<p>
	Your MIND is constructing "physical" "reality". The reality you construct is precisely of the sort which allows you to survive as yourself. Everything you consider "real" is filtered through your ego to make sure it allows the illusion of a self to survive as the illusion that it is, without you realizing that it is an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	If you weren't doing this, you'd be dead and a physical world would not exist.
</p>

<p>
	2+2=4 is a relative truth. It is true because you say it is and by how you situate it within your entire scheme of conceptual understanding. It is not an Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	This is why you cannot boil this work down to some stupid platitude like "be in the now".
</p>

<p>
	This work is much more complex and subtle than newbies imagine it to be.
</p>

<p>
	The ramifications of nondual awareness are enormous and they cannot be formalized.
</p>

<p>
	This is why post-awakening a lot of integration work is required. Your mind has to do work to figure out how to adopt Truth/Absolute to everyday life. And it is VERY EASY for your mind to distort the Truth and embody it incorrectly.
</p>

<p>
	Hitler could come to your house with a flamethrower and if you're naive, you might tell yourself something like, "Just be in the now" and that will be a huge mistake.
</p>

<p>
	It takes great intelligence to apply high spiritual teachings and principles. Newbies and fools will make terrible mistakes.

<p>
	Mostly dangers of being too unfocused or too conceptual.
</p>

<p>
	Theory and practice must be delicately balanced. Few people know how to strike this balance. They mostly veer off too much in one direction or the other.
</p>

<p>
	If you like my work, being too conceptual will be one of your biggest obstacles. If you don't like my work, studying too little theory will be one of your greatest obstacles.

<p>
	There is no right or wrong. It's all relative to survival.

<p>
	Hence there is conflict and disagreement, and it will always exist.

<p>

<p>
	There are some dangers to that approach as well. There are dangers everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	But overall I am highly in favor of studying 100s of sources or you will become deluded. Then again, you will probably also become deluded if you study 100s of sources.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to avoid delusion.

My mind-body was in full resonance from the beginning and that guy in the video is resonating with elf beings on low doses.  Yet, some mind-bodies are more like “meh, that was a waste of time and effort”.

<p>
	It's because very few people understand the breadth of this work. It's not only deep, it's broad. Psychological and sociological aspects of it cannot be ignored the way that many narrow nondual teachings assume.
</p>

<p>
	An integral approach is not done by almost any teacher or school. Thus horrendous gaps result.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of spiritual folks are in denial about the work's breadth. They want it to be as simple as someone like Eckhart Tolle or Rupert Spira makes it seem. But it just isn't.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Sure
</p>

<p>
	You could give yourself a panic attack without even taking psychedelics. It all depends on how your use your mind.
</p>

<p>
	To trip well you need to be relatively emotionally even-keeled. If your emotions and mind are all over the place, if your life is mess, you're not stable enough to trip, the ego is too fragile and insecure. You need more basic personal development work first in that case.
</p>

<p>
	Tripping requires maturity and self-control.

<p>
	I'm not really familiar with what he does.
</p>

<p>
	But it's very easy to do years of Vipassana but not be awakened or really understand the depth of consciousness work. In fact I would say that most Westerners who practice Vipassana have no idea what awakening or nonduality really are. Because they are following a very narrow practice on blind faith.
</p>

<p>
	I have met people who have done Vipassana for 5-15 years but have no idea what the world enlightenment means. Not to mention many other aspects of spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	This work goes so deep and has so many layers to it that you should NEVER assume that a person who does any kind of practice is awake or understands spirituality. It's all too easy to turn spiritual practices into narrow robotic habits and dogmas.
</p>

<p>
	Sam Harris supposedly also does meditation and has even had some degree of realization of no-self. But his worldview is still thoroughly materialistic and dualistic, and he is still missing 98% of spirituality. This is extremely common in the West especially. Westerners tend to dabble in spirituality while thinking to themselves that they've figured it all out. This is to be expected.
</p>

<p>
	As a general rule of thumb:
</p>

<p>
	When someone talks about spirituality, does spirituality, or teaches spirituality -- NEVER, EVER assume that they are at the highest stages of it. Always be skeptical. Especially with Westerners. True masters are very rare. Fully comprehensive teachings are very rare.
</p>

<p>
	Most people who do spirituality are doing it very poorly, pathologically, and half-assing it. This is to be expected given that almost no one understands the full scope of the mind's self-deceptiveness.
</p>

<p>
	Even awakening will NOT make you immune to self-deception. So watch out!
</p>

			i am asking this because i have tried psychedelics 3 times now and my experiences can be summarized as follows: <strong>1st </strong>time shroom, very mild high, totally in touch with reality, did not have any insights <strong>2nd</strong> time ayahuasca in a ceremony, felt my body dissolve and panicked for about 30s, but also did not get any insights, <strong>3rd</strong> time, the worst yet, i took too big of a dose (shroom), and it was just plain weird, i totally lost contact with reality, like i couldnt tell whats real and whats a dream and i kind blacked out and was brought to the hospital... i remember during the peak that i had some realizations but because i overshot it, i dont remember much...
		</p>

		<p>
			what do you recommend in this situation? do you see some obvious mistakes in the way i am proceeding?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Sounds like you still haven't found the right sweet spot.
</p>

<p>
	Some substances are better/easier than others. Mushrooms can be twisted and hard to understand. Ayahausca can be overwhemling and very uncomfortable for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	What I recommend is tightening up your protocols and tripping in a very controlled manner.
</p>

<p>
	You could try the following routes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		1g of mushrooms >> 2g of mushrooms >> 3g of mushrooms >> until you hit your sweet spot
	</li>
	<li>
		75ug of LSD >> 125ug of LSD >> 200ug of LSD >> 250ug of LSD >> until you hit your sweet spot
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This must be done in a good comfortable quiet setting, free of distractions, free of people, and other nonsense. You must do it on an empty stomach and you must sit still and contemplate about the nature of reality with your eyes open. Your intention must be pure & serious.
</p>

<p>
	If you did all that, I don't see how you wouldn't have some nice breakthroughs.
</p>

<p>
	60 trips is not a lot. That's just the beginning.
</p>

<p>
	That's like saying that 60 days of meditation is a lot when people meditate for 1000s of days to get amazing results.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That of course is unknown. It could get worse, it could get better. We don't really know.
</p>

<p>
	Impeachment might not be the right move. Voting him out would probably be the best solution. All of this will get resolved in the future.
</p>

<p>
	Worrying too much about backlash is not a good general approach because it's fear-based. Rather than worrying about how a devil will react against your good action, just act in the highest good. Deal with the consequences as they arise.
</p>

<p>
	Devils will always bitch and moan against progress. This does not mean that we appease the devils and stop pushing for progress. Sometimes a battle is necessary. Seeking to maintain peace at all costs is too simplistic a strategy for navigating the complexity of life and politics. A very delicate balancing act is required.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be a doormat for devils. The highest spiritual teachers are NOT doormats. Jesus, Gandhi, MLK, etc were very vocal against devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Just be careful that when standing up against devils you yourself do not become a devil. That is the great trap. It's very hard to avoid.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's right. But the question is, what are we gonna do about it? Hitler was also an ego backlash against the German loses in WWI.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to fall into a false fatalism here. Because you could easily make a fallacious argument like this: "Well, since Hitler was elected by the people, that must be the will of God, so I guess we should just let Hitler do whatever he wants."
</p>

<p>
	No! No! No! You get to decided every second what kind of reality you want to create. And deciding to let a Hitler run wild without limit would be a lack of responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	It was God's will that people elected Hitler. It was God's will that Hitler kill many Jews. But it was also God's will that Hitler was resisted, stopped, and killed. See? God's will is a very complex thing which waxes and wanes.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, but what you're overlooking is that if we kick the tyrant out of power, that too SHOULD be happening.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is deciding itself in every moment. There is no fatalism in nonduality. You and we are all determining how we want reality to unfold. Do you want to sit by and let a tyrant run lose, or do you want to contain him? The choice is yours/ours. What kind of world do you want to create?
</p>

<p>
	This issue of will and choice is extremely subtle and sophisticated.

<p>

<p>
	Most people are so myopic they never expect that their favorite tyrant would ever harm them. Not realizing that it is the modus operandi of tyrants to only care about themselves. Trump does not give a shit about you. He is like a rabid dog, which will bite its master.

	Yes, some people literally sit down, do a few days of meditation or inquiry and BAM! -- they awaken. But this is very, very rare. Don't count on that happening. Obviously if that happens, great! Consider yourself very lucky. You won the spiritual lottery.

<p>
	That's the trick! There isn't a "how". Formlessness cannot be reached through any method or process. Formlessness just is. You are it. You cannot reach it through any steps because it is the zero-th step. It is impossibly direct.
</p>

<p>
	Although psychedelics can put you there in minutes.
</p>

<p>
	The reaching of formlessness is a spontaneous occurrence, like a lightning strike. You cannot predict it or make it happen. But you can increase the odds by intensifying your inquiry & concentration.

Consciousness is all there is and the thoughts and feelings are also consciousness, so how can they ultimately not be me?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course they are a part of you -- because everything is a part of you. But they are not essential to you. For example, a thought or feeling can arise and then disappear. It's disappearance does not change your essence. So what you are -- your essence -- is independent of all arising phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	What you're missing is that you must distinguish yourself from all form. You have to separate the formlessness which right now is intermixed and confused with various forms. Then, later, you will realize that formlessness and form are in fact identical. But at the same time, they can be distinguished! It's a paradox.
</p>

<p>
	Your first awakening experience is you realizing that formlessness is distinct from all form. It's you realizing that Consciousness/You is distinct from any content that arises.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like a TV realizing that it is distinct from the images it displays. In the unenlightened state you are like a TV which is attached to the forms it displays, not realizing that in fact all forms could disappear without affecting the TV's existence.
</p>

<p>
	What you are looking for with self-inquiry is PURE CONSCIOUSNESS. Consciousness without any forms.
</p>

<p>
	But be careful, what I said above does not mean that any particular forms must be eliminated. So don't get some silly idea in your head that your sensory field will somehow turn off or go black. That's not what I mean. I mean you must realize that the sensory field is always occurring within formlessness. Like water is always occurring within some container. The True Self is the container. Find yourself as the empty container which holds the world. Right now you are so identified with the world that you cannot see the transparent container.
</p>

<p>
	Form = the material world
</p>

<p>
	Formlessness = the transparent container which holds it
</p>

<p>
	And ultimately, Form = Formlessness
</p>

<p>
	That's what "nonduality" means: not two.
</p>

<p>
	Of course in the Absolute sense, Trump is part of the total perfection. But that does not make him some strategic genius here to save mankind. If Trump is allowed free reign, he will cause a lot of harm. Such tyrants need to be stopped. The entire universe will conspire to stop his devilry. Or rather, his devilry will be the cause of his undoing.

<p>
	That is a very dumb phrase. 99.999% of people are not enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment means consciousness of one's true nature. Without CONSCIOUSNESS of it, there is no enlightenment even though, yes, you are still God. But you don't know you're God, hence not enlightened.

Sometimes it seems to me that many people are obsessed with becoming enlightened just because they can't tolerate themselves anymore, and use it as spiritual bypassing.

<p>
	EVERYTHING IS SPIRITUAL. It's just a question of how conscious are you about whatever you are doing. How conscious is your job, your business, your family, your relationships, your friendships, your finances, your entertainment, your art, your government, your politics, your science, your speech, your thinking, your emotions, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual just means: degree of consciousness, from zero to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Low spirituality = massive ego, massive devilry, maximum suffering
</p>

<p>
	High spirituality = little ego, unconditional love & goodness, minimal suffering
</p>

<title>Fasting before an LSD trip</title>

<p>
	It's not necessary to fast or have a special diet for long before the trip. Just make sure you trip on at least 4 hours of empty stomach and it will be fine.
</p>

<p>
	Fruits are good prior to and after the trip. Although usually after a deep trip I get very hungry and need more food than just some fruit. So have snacks handy. Often times I will half-way into the trip, and it creates no problems. As long as you're past the peak. Don't snack until you're past the peak.

Just sit and kinda stare at consciousness itself.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with asking too many questions is that the mind then gets in the mood of giving verbal answers, which is never going to be enough.
</p>

<p>
	The Neti Neti method is helpful here. Anything you identify as yourself, you must negate by realizing that that thing or property cannot be the True Self.
</p>

<p>
	What you're really looking for is formlessness. "The seer" is formlessness. So any from you think you are cannot be it. And you have to be very careful about not thinking "I am formlessness" because that is still form!
</p>

<p>
	This is supposed to be frustrating process and it takes intense concentration to break through. You will not break through if you do this process without intensity and consistency. 20 minutes of inquiry is just not going to produce enough intensity for a breakthrough. It's very important to schedule some long periods of time for nothing but inquiry. Like a solid week of full-time 12-hours-per-day inquiry. That is how people break through in practice. You must concentrate on it like an obsessive psychopath.

You shouldn't do it much over text or message. You must do it in-person. Text does not give you enough cues to know how the girl is reacting.
</p>

<p>
	In a face-to-face conversation you can quickly apologize like: "I was just joking. I actually love you. I want you to have my babies." But you cannot do that via text. It looks too weird and creepy.
</p>

<p>
	DO NOT try to attract women via text! It never works. Texts are purely for setting up a date and keeping in touch. Don't get overly cute via texts or you will lose many girls that way. Attraction must be built in-person. No amount of text game will compensate for shitting face-to-face game.
</p>

<p>
	Sarcasm and self-deprecating humor also does not work well via texts. Because texts do not convey enough information.

	That hits the nail on the head! Amen

<p>
	That's what it's like to be spiritually attuned. It's like being a different human being. People like that are not common.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I am able to do Actualized.org is because I have some degree of this attunement (but not any paranormal abilities). It comes naturally to me. But even so, I have to struggle really hard to actualize it and live up to my full potential. Do not assume that it just comes effortlessly. With great intelligence comes great responsibility.

This is false. Even if you are not spirituality talented, you can absolutely train yourself to be massively spiritual. It will just take more work.
</p>

<p>
	Talent is a real thing. But talent alone is never enough and it's a terrible life strategy to expect to coast on your talent. It is also a mistake to not do spirituality because you are not talented at it. It's worth doing regardless of your talent.

</p>

<p>
	A very important aspect of taking psychedelics is to do in such a way that you do not traumatize yourself or freak yourself out so much that you never want to do it again.
</p>

<p>
	Very commonly what happens is that people take to high a dose, totally freak out, lose all memory of the trip, and then vow to never touch a psychedelic again. In my book, this is a total failure. You must learn how to trip consistently and moderately if you want psychedelics to transform your life. Blasting yourself is not the goal. Neither is microdosing and staying beneath a breakthrough. You want steady consistent breakthroughs which you can integrate well. Find a dosage and administration method which does this for you. It will be different from person to person.

<p>
	You and 99% of humans. That's normal. That's just a consequence of being disconnected from your True Self and enmeshed in the Matrix of culture.
</p>

<p>
	Your survival almost entirely hinges on surviving within the Matrix of culture. Misalignment here can easily get you killed, so ego struggles and suffers a lot to navigate this domain successfully.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			what should person like this do? Try fit in?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice you should do both:
</p>

<p>
	1) Try to fit in within reason. Don't bend over backwards but also don't rock the boat too much. You don't want to be locked in jail, or punched in the face, or sued, or fired by your boss. So in this sense you must fit in within reason. But most people go way beyond this, trying to fit in far too much to the point of becoming a slave to impressing others.
</p>

<p>
	2) Work towards awakening and transcending your biographical and social identity. With this a great relief will come and you'll find yourself able to fit in without struggling to fit in. You will just flow with life and you won't worry to much about playing social roles. Yet at the same time you will still be able to play them, but consciously rather than reactively. So you won't suffer from not fitting in the way you do now. You will find your unique personality and place in life and you will stop caring how others judge you. It will not affect your happiness because you'll be totally grounded in your authentic personality and in your heart.
</p>

<p>
	What people don't realize is that an enormous part of their identity is social. We'll discuss that in future videos. Very few spiritual teachings discuss this aspect of waking up.
</p>

<p>
	If you realize that a causal chain is infinite, it's basically the same as realizing that nothing is caused at all. Because zero and infinity are identical.
</p>

<p>
	You could say there are infinite causes.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could say that everything is its own cause.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could say that everything in uncaused.
</p>

<p>
	Those are just different ways of looking at the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	It's paradoxical because Infinity cannot be captured in symbols or any linear finite framework. Infinity always finds a way to break out of any linear framework such as: A causes B causes C... causes Z. Nope! Cannot be that way. That kind of framework will ALWAYS be partial and incomplete. The Absolute cannot be formalized. Truth must always be bigger than anything you can say about it.

			Do you think that some spiritually-gifted people are discouraged from developing their abilities and never reach their potential?

<p>
	Yes, this can happen, especially with a bad upbringing.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, if a person is truly spiritually gifted they should have some sense of it, however faint and obscured it may be by bad social conditioning. These people should feel like "I am just different from other people." They may not know why yet or how, but they can intuit that they don't quite fit in with dumb society."

	This question makes no sense.

<p>
	I don't recommend psychedelics for people under 21 and those who are not emotionally mature. The reason I don't recommend it for people under 21 is because they are generally not emotionally mature or responsible. But there are always exceptions.

	If you're asking that question, then you probably aren't, unless maybe you had a really dysfunctional childhood.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking, spiritually gifted people will have one or more of the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Find it very easy to meditate or concentrate
	</li>
	<li>
		Are extremely interested in metaphysical and spiritual topics (more so than other topics)
	</li>
	<li>
		Are naturally very loving
	</li>
	<li>
		Really interested in Truth for its own sake
	</li>
	<li>
		Have paranormal abilities: they see auras, angels, and others weird stuff, they have telepathic abilities, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		Exceptionally intuitive
	</li>
	<li>
		They have spontaneous kundalini activation/awakenings
	</li>
	<li>
		Are wise beyond their years, wiser than all their peers
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Not all of those need to be present. Just one or two of those is already great.
</p>

Unconscious rulers become tyrants who spread evil and chaos. Case in point: Trump
</p>

<p>
	There is a profound link between spirituality and government.
</p>

<p>
	Of course don't confuse spirituality with organized religion. I am not talking about theocracy.

<p>
	Great!
</p>

<p>
	Looking forward to reading a detailed write-up from you once you return.
</p>

<p>
	It will be difficult but worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Hang in there. Don't give up.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If you have not successfully completed at 2 week retreat, start there! 30 days is REALLY REALLY hard.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's awakening. Or at least one degree of it. There's almost always more.
</p>

<p>
	The trick also is integrating it into your everyday life and living in alignment with it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, we've had this similar experience.

<p>
	At the same time, don't hate culture either. Just become aware of how limited, partial, and artificial it is.
</p>

<p>
	There is no liberation or freedom without transcending one's culture.

<p>
	For me it feels like I am borderline. There's no full ego-death, so the ego can feel uncomfortable as it twists around trying to make sense of things.
</p>

<p>
	Those borderline trips can be some of the worst. You want to find a dose that blasts you past the borderline state but doesn't lead to whiteout or overwhelm. That should be somewhere in the 20-25 mg range for plugged HCl. Oxalate is weaker than HCl so if you're using that you might need to go higher. If your substance is not pure, if it's not white-colored, you'll need a higher dose.
</p>

<p>
	Any color other than white contains impurities.
</p>

<p>
	If you are smoking it, your dose needs to be much lower. Do NOT smoke 20-25mg unless you've done lower doses.
</p>

Don't pre-judge your results.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing in the duality videos suggests you should stop brushing your hair or wiping your ass. It's much more nuanced than that.
</p>

<p>
	It's going to take you lots of experience and contemplation to understand what was said in these duality videos.

<title>How to deal with having nothing to do at work</title>

<p>
	This could actually be a great opportunity. You could:
</p>

<p>
	1) Use that time to meditate, concentrate, contemplate, or self-inquire.
</p>

<p>
	2) Use that time to start your own life purpose/business. Plan it out at least.
</p>

<p>
	3) Use that time to do something creative like writing a book.
</p>

<p>
	I planned my first business at my 9-5 job during downtime when I had no work to do.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately you should design your life such that you don't have this kind of downtime at work, as it's highly inefficient and a waste of one's life. Make very minute of your work connect to your LP.
</p>

			Leo what would you say to someone who's afraid to awaken for the first time? It seems like you would freak out from all of the realizations hitting you at once. Simultaneously realizing you're God/Everything, you were never born, your family isn't real, and that there isn't even a me sounds like a little much to take in lol. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It will not happen all at once. It will take you years to realize all those facets.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to overcome fear of awakening is via a psychedelic. It's not so hard. You will learn to enjoy ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	There's honestly nothing to fear but fear itself.

<p>
	No, that is not what I said. I said that you must look at the low vs high axis rather than the right vs left axis.
</p>

<p>
	You are looking at the wrong axis. Forget for a moment that the right vs left axis even exists. Focus on the low vs high axis.
</p>

<p>
	The key question is: how conscious are you? How universal is your identity?
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious that you are Hitler? No? Then you're not very conscious and your politics will reflect this disowned shadow of yours.

<p>
	We don't have to guess. There are many Jesus-level mystics alive on the planet right now. You can meet them face to face.
</p>

<p>
	People would consider most of them "radical left-wingers."
</p>

<p>
	The issue is complicated somewhat by the fact that one can be deeply enlightened but still not highly developed on the Spiral. Many Eastern mystics are stage Blue. They will be more conservative. But anyone at stage Green or higher will appear very liberal.
</p>

<p>
	Conservative vs liberal is a totally relative designation. It all depends on what you're using as your benchmark. Compared to Jews from 2000 years ago, Ben Shapiro and Fox News is a terrible example of liberalism.

<p>
	Killing and eating is also you. And every lifeform must kill other lifeforms.
</p>

<p>
	This is what you need to learn to love. This is the real test of your capacity to love. Can you love evil? If not, your love is weak and egoic.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how conveniently you ignore how many lifeforms you kill to sustain yourself.

<title>&quot;My Descent into the Alt-Right Pipeline&quot; Good video on internet radicalisation.</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The bias of a mystic is Truth, Goodness, Love, Consciousness, and Harmony.
</p>

<p>
	This does not square well with right-wing or conservative politics because the primary appeal of conservativism is ego and closedmindedness.
</p>

<p>
	You never heard of Jesus flipping over the money-lender's table? That was a very political act against the corrupt status quo. For this he was eventually crucified.
</p>

<p>
	Truth and Love upsets the political establishment very much, because it is always run by devils. Devils seek power and money. Mystics seek Truth and Love.
</p>

<p>
	See, the devil hates it when a mystic points him out as a devil. Because a devil can only stay a devil when he has other people and himself confused. But a mystic sees right through a devil because he is the Truth. So the mystic is the highest threat to devils. So the devil's #1 priority is to silence, demonize, and kill the highest mystics. The devil does all this without knowing he is doing it. Because if he knew, he could not do it.
</p>

<p>
	All I'm doing is pointing out devilry to devils. To a devil this might look like a "left-wing bias".
</p>

<p>
	More broadly-speaking, do I have opinions and biases? Of course. Every mind does. That's not the issue. The issue is, how conscious are you of your mind's biases? Are you aware of how selfish your mind is? Are you aware that your entire reasoning faculty has been hijacked by ego?
</p>

<p>
	See, what I'm talking about is not a matter of left or right, it is a meta matter. It is a matter of one's altitude of perspective. You should not be so much concerned with left vs right as high vs low.
</p>

<p>
	Very practically speaking, as you move into Spiral stages Green, Yellow, Turquoise and beyond you will appear to others as much more liberal/left-wing. This is a relative matter. It appears this way simply because high stages of development are very rare and society/culture/politics is dominated by the much lower stages of Red/Blue/Orange. These low stages are extremely mypoic, selfish, reactive, and closeminded. Almost at animal like levels.
</p>

<p>
	Visionary, cutting-edge perspectives appear radical to ordinary folks. This has always been the case. Amongst a horde of slave-owners, someone questioning slavery looks very "left-wing." The slave-owners will have no choice but to demonize the person questioning slavery because it is a direct threat to their survival.
</p>

<title>Questions on identity</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/33948-questions-on-identity/?do=findComment&amp;comment=407740</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	This issue is far deeper than you yet realize.
</p>

<p>
	Your identity as a human is a false one, but you need it to survive in the social domain. So you play various manipulation games, trying to suit your identity to what has social survival value. This makes it impossible to ever be happy about yourself because all these social identities are pure fiction.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate solution is to awaken out of that false identity to your true identity -- as Nothing/God. For this enlightenment is required.
</p>

<p>
	You can make your current identity more authentic and less pathological and less reactive. This will make your life better. But you will never be fully satisfied with that until you finally awaken to the fact that your true identity is Emptiness and formlessness.
</p>

<p>
	You are literally not anything. Or pure consciousness without any properties or forms. You are also litterally the entire universe. So how could any human identity make you satisfied?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	So you are standing in your own way by your attachment to being human.
</p>

<p>
	All you have to do is die. But that is the last thing you want to do. Hence the struggle. Struggle is part of survival.
