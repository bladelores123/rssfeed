			But that's just the same as saying that there aren't any moral requirements at all. That would mean that Donald Trumps lying, cheating etc. are in fact not a hindrance to his awakening.Because he is imagining that he is doing the right things.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Awakening is not normative. You are not obligated to awaken. Awakening is not better than not awakening.
</p>

<p>
	So yes, Trump will not awaken, but there is no one in the universe to say that is wrong. In fact God loves Trump just as much as the Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	It is us humans who judge Trump because it affects our survival and we are self-biased in that sense.
</p>

<p>
	So we can rightly kick Trump out of office, but that has nothing to do with him being bad in any absolute sense. It is a relative matter.

</p>

<p>
	A Masters or PhD in engineering is much more functional.
</p>

<p>
	Philosophy in particular is not meant to be studied in a university. This preverts the whole point of philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do serious philosophy, get yourself a bag of mushrooms and DMT and start doing yoga.

<p>
	Why? It will mostly be a waste of time. You can grow far better on your own and save the the money.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason for a masters or PhD is if you want to be university professor. It serves no other function and it certainly won't help you understand Truth.

<p>
	We are not going to be discussing extraction methods or creation methods on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that extraction and creation puts you into a whole nother category of legal problems. You will be treated as a drug dealer, not merely a recreational user. So do not go this route.
</p>

<p>
	If you are living with your parents you should not be doing this stuff at all. Be careful and don't fuck up your life.

	Psychedelics are far too threatening to all worldviews below Green.

<p>

<p>
	This is an important topic.
</p>

<p>
	Medically, psychedelics like MDMA and mushrooms will soon be approved by the FDA for clinical use. This will happen within the next 5-10 years.
</p>

<p>
	Weed legalization is important toward the ultimate legalization of psychedelics, so we need more states legalizing recreational weed, and we really need a federal legalization of weed. This might happen within the next 5-15 years.
</p>

<p>
	And then we just need the most progressive states like California, Oregon, Washington, NY, etc. to start legalizing mushrooms & LSD. This should start to happen in the next 5-20 years.
</p>

			Buddhists on one hand claim that you have to follow certain ethical rules to become enlightened and to be seen as enlightened and his argument is that there is no reason for that to be the case if enlightenment is only a spiritual shift. His example with the pills is used to as an argument that there is such a thing as enlightenment without adhering to moral precepts.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not so simple.
</p>

<p>
	Adhering to moral precepts is part of the path. It's hard to reach satori if one is a devil. Hard, but not impossible. And it's hard to live in alignment with satori if one doesn't adhere to some moral precepts.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the moral precepts serve as training wheels.
</p>

<p>
	Even when doing psychedelics, your trips won't go very deep unless your mind is pure enough. Giving psychedelics to a guy like Donald Trump will not result in his realization of Buddha nature because his mind is too impure. First his actions would have to change. He'd have to stop lying, stealing, cheating, manipulating, etc. Or at the very least cut back on them.
</p>

<p>
	Of course enlightenment does not require adhering to anything. It is total liberation. But in practice you'll never reach it unless you make an effort to be less egotistical.
</p>

<p>
	A spiritual shift is also an ethical & moral shift.
</p>

<p>
	If you complain that people are devils after enlightenment, just try to imagine how big of devils they would have been without it.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake here is expecting some kind of perfect moral actions from people. This is not possible because morality is relative. Zizek likes to moralize without acknowledging that his moralizations are constructed by his own mind. If you are digusted by Nazis and Stalanists, it's not because they are inherently disgusting, it's because your mind is doing it out of survival drive. That is a self-bias Zizek's mind projects onto reality. Zizek seems to hold people like Nazi's as an absolute evil or wrong-doing, but that it is not Truth. That's not how a Nazi looks after satori.
</p>

<p>
	Perfection is not something one achieves through good moral actions. Perfection is already the case. All one needs to do is attain satori to see it.
</p>

			With plugging of a breakthrough dose, is there any chance of freaking out or yelling/screaming? I'd like to do it in my room, but have roommates. Don't want to alarm them with a major freakout. If it's just a gentle trip full of insight, I wouldn't worry about doing it at home.

<p>
	Of course this will depend on you.
</p>

<p>
	Some people love to yell. Personally I never feel the need to yell. For me it's too profound for yelling. Silence is golden.
</p>

<p>
	The best idea if you have roommates is to rent a cheap motel room for the trip. You can probably find a room for $40 on the outskirts of town.

<p>

<p>
	5-10mg is petty low dose.
</p>

<p>
	But if I had to guess, the SSRIs will probably block most of dose regardless.
</p>

<p>
	It's not a scam. You're just not following proper tripping protocol.
</p>

<p>
	You are lucky something worse didn't happen.

<p>
	This is definitely NOT how my trips look like at all.
</p>

<p>
	I think that is very dangerous and unnecessary.
</p>

<p>
	There is no need for water when tripping other than if you're thirsty, which you shouldn't be. Just drink a bit before your trip.
</p>

<p>
	The dose there is also too high. That kind of dose would traumatize many people.
</p>

<p>
	You can achieve massive breakthroughs in a safe & gentle way through plugging.

<p>
	It's both, since infinite/finite is a duality. Depends on what state of consciousness you're in.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you think is finite is actually infinite at a high enough degree of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There is the human mind, and then there is Universal Mind. The human mind is just a partial form of Universal Mind, the way a finger is part of a hand. When mind becomes Universal Mind, everything becomes knowable.

		</p>

		<p>
			He says that consciousness is dependent on the body and ends with it, as opposed to Nothingness which exists regardless as the formless, underlying foundation to the world of form, but ultimately one with form.
		</p>

		<p>
			He says: "Some readers may be wondering why I say that Awareness is not the Absolute(...). If pressed as to whether or not consciousness is the Absolute, I would say, that, Mind is not Mind , yet neither is it no-mind. (...) In Nothingness, there is some degree of awareness present -it is not how most people imagine brain death- albeit unconditioned, object- and subjectless. The Consciousness (for lack of better word) of Non-Being is so subtle that the moment we try to reflect upon it to check if we are conscious, we are jarred back into 'bein' and into our ordinary dualistic consciousness. I hesitate even to call this experience 'pure subjectivity' as that invites a metaphysical position that I am not willing to support.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's right, God is Nothingness, and Consciousness is Nothingness too.
</p>

<p>
	The word consciousness is tricky. People use it in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	The way I teach, consciousness is the only thing there is. But the consciousness I speak of is not produced by any human brain or body. And it does not end.

	The brutality of life is what makes it all the more beautiful. Try to see ignorance as love.
</p>

<p>
	You can also start a life purpose to work on solutions.
</p>

<p>
	If you love so much, why don't you become the leader and show the world how to love nature as deeply as you?

<p>
	You could be the next Gandhi. What is stopping you from pursuing your highest love? When are you gonna realize you are a powerful creator?

	Your skepticism should be as big as your willingness to dig up the truth.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with you skeptics is that you love to talk a lot but do no research.
</p>

<p>
	Go read every book & article ever written on development psychology until your skepticism is satisfied.

<p>
	Just because you're in some state of no-mind or absorption doesn't mean you have insight into reality.
</p>

<p>
	Meditative states are not good enough here. You have to want insight. Which requiring questioning.
</p>

<p>
	You can bliss out in meditation all you want, but it doesn't mean you understand what's going on and why.

<p>
	My classifications are very loose approximations. It very much depends on which parts of the country you consider. No country is a single color. That's an oversimplification we make for sake of convenience.
</p>

<p>
	So yes, your classifications may be slightly different than mine.

<p>
	Again, it's tricky here. God's plan is so epic that it's hard for the human mind to comprehend. The plan is highly non-linear. It's not like a movie director planning out a movie. Rather God's plan involves creating creators and giving them freedom to creator. It's a sort of meta-plan. The plan is to allow as many beings as possible to experience being God. For this plan to succeed God cannot force you to do stuff. God has to allow freedom for experimentation, making mistakes, conflict, catastrophe, etc. Things are not set in stone. Everything is fluid, and yet it all works perfectly in the end. That's the genius of the design. Any fool can write a linear story. But how do you write a story which allows every character in the story to write his own story and not have it turn into utter chaos?
</p>

<p>
	See, since God is totally selfless, it is not interested in ruling over you. It is interested in having you rule over yourself. So you could know the glory of being God.
</p>

<p>
	God is like the ultimate massively multiplayer video game designer. How you play the game is in your hands. It's an infinite sandbox. The plan is that you make the plan <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	P.S. If you haven't tried DPT, that's one of the most occult-like psychedelics I've tried. You could probably do some amazing stuff with it. It's highly visionary.

<p>
	I'm not saying that cancer is acting out of some personal love that it feels. Rather, cancer is simply a byproduct of the entire structure of the universe, which is designed to maximize love. For example, God created you with the freedom to create things. You can create a cigarette and smoke it. Then you can get cancer from it. That is simply a byproduct of how you choose to live your life and what you choose to create.
</p>

<p>
	God doesn't mind giving you enough rope to hang yourself. This is how you learn what life is.
</p>

<p>
	Cancer is largely a creation of mankind. We created it with the food and chemicals we create. If mankind really wanted to, we could restructure society to eliminate 95% of cancer cases. God's top priority is not your comfort but your freedom. You are free to poison yourself and the planet. You are free to nuke the whole world. That's the fun of creation. God wants to see what you will create. Will you create heaven or hell? Either way is fine from God's POV because God's Love is unlimited. Nothing you create, no matter how horrific, can shake God' Love. God will Love it because God is all things and God is too conscious to hate itself. God is incapable of self-hatred, other than through human form. Self-hatred is only possible at less than infinite consciousness.

<p>
	It's tricky here because, remember, the future is imaginary. When you realize that, your question will sort of resolve itself.
</p>

<p>
	I have experienced omniscience. It is possible. But it doesn't work the way you imagine. It's not about predicting the future. It's about realizing that you imagine everything.

<p>
	You are making a mockery of Allah. Allah hates no one.

<p>
	Killing is a necessary part of life. Without killing there could not be human society at it now exists.

	I didn't say to kill for no reason. Life is complex and there are often good reasons for killing.

<p>
	Look at it from the POV of the tumor. That tumor is reproducing because it wants to live. Who are you to judge that the tumor is wrong? Do you see the self-bias in your view? Obviously you want your dog to live, but that's only one POV. You have to realize that reality does not merely revolve around what your ego wants. There is a much larger design which you are overlooking.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, sorry about your dog, and know that upon death your dog will melt into pure Infinite Love. So don't feel bad for it.

			As someone who has high functioning autism, I can say that I used to really close myself off from love (not as a child, but afterwards). However, one of the things that really changed for me was when I watched your “How To Be A Man - Part 2” episode where you talk about owning and accentuating our feminine qualities. I started getting more in touch with that this past year. Just last month, I became friends with a a girl. I can express all my emotions to her and she can really relate to them. We don’t judge each other and accept each other for who we are, but especially the flaws. She even opened up to me about how she is constantly suicidal. She was contemplating suicide one day; the only person she could open up to at that moment was me.

<p>
	From the absolute perspective, nothing.

<p>
	But the key is becoming conscious of what Love is. Without that it's hard to understand what loving really is.

<p>
	The most important thing is not to act lovingly, but to have an awakening to what Love is.

<p>
	It's similar to acting selflessly. Selfless action is less important than realizing there is no self.

			I am approaching 50 years of age. I have 1.2 lungs due to surgery for spindle cell sarcoma in 2010. I then was diagnosed with a non-related Carcinoma (different subtype of cancer) in my right kidney in 2015. Both were excized via laproscopy and knife (traditional surgery) respectively. I still live. My boxer dog died of Cancer a few years ago. Tumors all through her body. My wife and I were devastated. Her mother died of two years ago. Her father died of C.O.P.D. while we were living in his house taking care of him earlier this year. 3 months later my own dad died of a Glioblastoma (severe brain tumor) after slowly losing his mind. He used to be a Ph.D in History. Consciousness witnessed the total dissolusion of his "mind" (a nonexistant) as did us and his loved ones after attempting to keep his cath clean while he was on hospice. I moved out of my home and left all my worldly possesions to be my wife's father's full time hospice nurse, with no previous experience. Right after he died I had to help my mother with my dad. We survived.

<p>
	Not exactly sure what you mean.
</p>

<p>
	I try to have a full range of expressiveness. I'm not trying to act lovey-dovey all the time to fit some kind of stereotype of a loving person.
</p>

<p>
	But also I am still very much in the process of purifying myself. I'm nowhere near complete. As I eliminate various defilements I will appear more loving from your POV.

	I don't know if merely saying such things will trigger an awakening. To be safe you'd want to supplement with psychedelics or other methods. But of course such affirmations and visualizations can be great.

<p>
	Of course.
</p>

<p>
	Lowercase love is ordinary human love as an emotion. It is limited and conditional. It has an opposite: hate.
</p>

<p>
	Uppercase Love is an Absolute with no opposite. It is the substrate of all existence. It includes love + hate and everything else. It is not an emotion although it can trigger strong emotions of lowercase love.
</p>

<p>
	Uppercase Love is a mystical awakening. It is a kind of enlightenment. This is usually a combination of feeling loving + insight into the nature of what existence is. Afterwards although you may not feel loving all the time, you still know that all of existence is Love. Love no longer is limited to a personal feeling. You can feel angry and still know it is a form of Love.
</p>

<p>
	The highest feelings you get which motivate your life are a little taste of Love. But just a little taste. You will recognize the full scope of Love the moment you realize you just died.
</p>

<p>
	Love = Death
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Creation cannot occur without destruction. So by judging or demonizing one, you unwittingly shoot yourself in the foot and reject the large totality of reality.
</p>

<p>
	If you hate any aspect of reality, you are hating yourself, which means you are disconnected from God's Love and your vision is clouded by ego & delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Total enlightenment robs you of the ability to judge reality. Sorry. I know how much you love to hate, but that shit won't fly if you want to reach the highest levels of understanding.
</p>

			Hey Leo, my question is:
		</p>

		<p>
			Why is it important for us, egos, to blind ourselves to absolute love through survival?<br />
			What purpose, function, does this blinding serve from the "point of view" of absolute love?<br />
			How does this blinding serve the egos and absolute love itself?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Without survival you could not experience anything. So survival is the #1 requirement of any kind of formed existence.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose is to have you experience the multiplicity of Creation, the formed world.
</p>

<p>
	You are just like a droplet of water which has to break off from the ocean, fly up into the air, and then re-merge with the ocean. The purpose of this is to experience what it's like to be separated from the ocean and then to rediscover what it's like to be the ocean. You can't appreciate being the whole ocean without first breaking off and being a drop.

<p>
	The highest form of Love is most detached. Attachment limits love. But it is easier for egos to do attached love.

<p>
	That was a good start. You must deepen your appreciation for life. Keep at it.
</p>

<p>
	You are surrounded by infinite beauty all day long. You just gotta train yourself to appreciate it. Survival rips your attention away from the beauty of being.

			Hey Leo.  I have a question... sometimes I have seen the power of love turn around negative relationships.  Like when people have treated me badly I turned around and treated them well and it eventually led them to them treating me well too.  Other times it has felt like I have let others abuse me or have felt like I gave too much to the point of feeling bad and having to close down and pull back.
		</p>

		<p>
			I feel its a fine line and I try to err on the side of giving and loving more.   
		</p>

		<p>
			Its like being open and vulnerable is a beautiful thing that can do wonders in many situations but sometimes it feels like you over expose yourself to others who might hurt you.
		</p>

		<p>
			I feel like when you are totally alligned you can just bulldoze your way through everything with love transforming and uplifting people´s energy as you go but other times I have felt like I am just kidding myself and just overgiving or sacrificing.
		</p>

		<p>
			I guess honest communication with yourself and with others is the way to go, but its hard to know sometimes in the middle of a situation.
		</p>

		<p>
			Any thoughts on navigating this?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice I think it's always going to be tricky. Relationships are soaked through with survival issues so there's always a give and take dynamic. A careful dynamic balance is required. See my video on the issue of Balance.
</p>

<p>
	Think of relationships like surfing. You're balancing dynamically so it's always temporary victories and occasional wipe outs. But the more you practice the better you get and the less wipe outs you have.
</p>

<p>
	Relationships definitely require setting some boundaries. You can't just be lovey-dovey all the time. Setting boundaries is part of Love. But of course being more empathetic and unconditionally loving of yourself and your partner generally helps. Most relationships are ruined with judgment, criticism, and disrespect.
</p>

<p>
	Those are just two different ways of framing the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Learning how to love is about eliminating various judgments and selfish attachments. But it can also be proactive. Just, like, practice loving things more! It can be that simple.

</p>

<p>
	What happened there was by reading that sign, your small picture was expanded to a bigger picture. As the picture got bigger is put otherwise ugly & bad things into proper context, thus erasing the badness and ugliness.
</p>

<p>
	Now imagine that extrapolated to the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	My claim is this: if you adopt a large enough picture, every action that has ever occurred or will ever occur in the universe will be seen as an expression of Absolute Love. But you need to seriously expand your picture. It's far too small. In fact, your picture must become infinite.

<p>
	The only way is to realize that you ARE Love. This results in total absolute self-acceptance and self-love. Since you are God, your love for yourself is Absolute and unlimited. Since you are God, no one can love you but yourself. If you cannot love & accept yourself, no one else can and you are forever doomed by your own self-denial and self-hatred until you realize that self-love is the only true love.

<p>
	Religion is highly corrupt. The devil has co-opted all religion to use as a control mechanism. Fear (of Hell) is a powerful control mechanism. Many humans do no know how to follow basic rules of decency unless they are threatened with eternal Hell.
</p>

<p>
	When a child misbehaves, the easiest way to make it behave is to threaten it with a beating. Then the child quickly falls in line and obeys. Like a dog. This is the level that many people function at.

			Can Love be maximized - if Everything is Love?

			Is metaphysical love distinct from Absolute Love and common conditional love?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is where things necessarily get paradoxical.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, everything IS Love. But also, what is includes everything that is occurring at all levels and orders or reality. So just like at the order of atoms, that is Love, at the order of human social activities, that is love. So when the US bombs targets in the Middle East, the bombs are literally made out of love and with love, and they are dropped out of love -- despite the fact that they kill innocent civilians.
</p>

<p>
	This is so because there is a bigger picture to the universe which transcends the death of any one living being, no matter how innocent. The ego of course hates this idea and vehemently denies it. Because it's too dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	Love is maximized precisely BECAUSE everything is love!
</p>

<p>
	Metaphysical is just another word I use for Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Common conditional love is just a very narrow version of Absolute Love. It is like Absolute Love diluted to 0.00000001%. What makes it conditional is the desire for survival. Humans don't love unconditionally because it's far too dangerous. If you loved a grizzly bear unconditionally it might eat you.
</p>

<p>
	Attachment to survival requires modulation of unconditional love because survival is by definition conditional! You need certain conditions to be alive. So you are in an existential bind. You must either choose survival or unconditional love. For most people this isn't even a choice. Survival dictates the choosing of survival. Otherwise you couldn't be here to make the choice. It's the ultimate catch-22.

	Appreciation of the person's innate beauty. Not physical beauty or function. But the beauty of their totality of being.
</p>

<p>
	When you can look Hitler in the eye and see his beauty, there is your love.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. You are still free to kill him. Love and killing are not opposite. Seeing the beauty of a thing says nothing about what you should do from a survival perspective. You can see the beauty of cancer, but then decide to destroy the cancer. Destruction is part of the total beauty of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Try this: The next time you want to kill a house fly, first, stop for moment and admire it's beauty. Then kill it and admire the beauty inherent in the destruction. Notice that without destruction there could not be life. Admire the beauty of your internal conflict and moral deliberations about killing that fly. That too is love. You feel bad because you wish you could love that fly. Yet you also know you needed to kill that fly because you cannot allow a house full of dirty flies and maggots. Admire the beauty of survival. Yours and the fly's. Admire the inherent conflict between the two of you. Let the magnitude of it hit you. Imagine yourself as the fly being killed. Notice the sad beauty of that too.
</p>

<p>
	Survival dominates your life. Universal Love can be counter-productive to your survival.
</p>

<p>
	But also it's not so elusive. You love certain stuff all day long. You go to lunch and you love it. You jerk off and you love it. You watch Netflix and you love. You see a sunset and you love it. Your dog licks your face and you love it. You take a big shit and you love it. You earn some money and you love it. You crash on the couch after a long day and you love it. You read some profound book and you love it. You take a hot shower and your body loves it.
</p>

<p>
	If your life didn't have love in it, you would kill yourself pretty soon.
</p>

<p>
	What is the universe doing as a whole? Forget about individual people or atoms. What is the ENTIRE thing up to? Is it just a random mess of stuff? No! It's doing something intelligent. Consider the possibility that what it's doing is maximizing the expression of metaphysical love. If this were true, you can see how the movement of every atom would contribute to that ultimate goal in the same way that every atom in your computer's hard drive is contributing to the function of the hard drive storing data.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The materialist paradigm goes very deep. I think many people just assume that reality cannot be loving because it must be neutral or empty or mechanical and impersonal.
</p>

<p>
	Love is a distinct awakening that one must have. Some people, especially masculine men who tend to skew towards autistic may have a limited ability to realize love. Many men have closed hearts or avoid emotional expressiveness.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I'm not sure if a clinical psychopath can realize Love. My guess is he can, but he's just not very likely to.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston's style is very reductionistic, clinical, masculine. It's that classic sort of Zen style. But this is only one style of spirituality. It's not Truth per se. It's a style. It's one expression of Truth.
</p>

<p>
	But honestly I don't know why he doesn't get it. That's a good question that requires some scientific research.
</p>

<p>
	I am planning several new videos on the topic of Love.
</p>

<p>
	I will be addressing many common questions, objections, and misconceptions in those videos.
</p>

<p>
	So if you have a <u>genuine</u> question or objection about what Love is, why it's important, or how it works, ask here.
</p>

<p>
	I'm looking for genuine questions from your direct experience, not trolling or devil's advocate games.
</p>

<p>
	Your question may not be answered in this thread. But there's a good chance it may be answered in the new videos.
</p>

This would keep people from stockpiling weapons they don't use for hunting/sport. That money could then be funneled to mental health, gun training programs, suicide prevention, and helping victims of shootings. It would be a like a gun insurance pool.

<p>
	Stage Blue has authoritarian tendencies. Because they like to follow a strong leader. So once a strong leader emerges by conquering everyone else, Blue falls in line and conforms.
</p>

<p>
	Blue loves, loves, loves conformity. It gives Blue a sense of security & comfort.
</p>

<p>
	Blue loves unambiguous black & white leadership style. Like in the military. Everyone knows his rank and knows exactly what is expected of him.
</p>

<p>
	Blue makes excellent soldiers because they are so loyal. Of course the problem is, Blue also makes excellent Nazis.

		<p>
			You seem to put more effort/emphasis in communicating/teaching True Love than something like True Perfection. If this is so, why? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well of course what one chooses to emphasize when teaching is rather subjective and arbitrary.
</p>

<p>
	I am interested in teaching all aspects of the Absolute. But this makes the teaching far more complex. And it requires time to roll the teaching out.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that what you see of my teaching is a very early version, a work in progress that isn't even 10% complete. So when the full teaching is complete 10-20 years from now, then you can nitpick what I left out. But when you finally see the full teaching, you'll be more than satisfied.
</p>

<p>
	Love & Perfection as so closely related that it's not a big deal. When speaking you're gonna have to choose one framing vs another. All speech is limited and cannot fully capture what needs to be said.
</p>

<p>
	More practically, Love is something ordinary people can resonate with and learn to practice in their daily lives. Videos on that coming soon.
</p>

<p>
	Contrary to Love being some philosophical abstraction, Love is the fastest way to get people onto the spiritual path. People have a deep intuitive feel for love. Love cuts through the rational mind. If you've ever deeply loved another being, you'll understand how much God loves you and how powerful Love is. There is no power higher than your capacity to love. Love overcomes every single obstacle.
</p>

<p>
	All meaning is a construction of the mind. You are creating it while not realizing you are creating it.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't make meaning good or bad. It just is what it is. Become aware of how you create meaning.

Many people will disagree with this as the ego wants to put relative conditions on what is Perfect. "How can a car with flat tires be Perfect??!!". Yet this hijacks True Perfection for conditional perfection. In doing so, one cannot realize True Perfection. It seems like something similar is going on with True Love and conditional love - yet this may be even harder to realize since humans seem to be much more attached/identified to conditional love.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes. Perfection, Paradise, Heaven, etc.
</p>

<p>
	But Love is yet distinct from Perfection.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot reduce Love down to anything else, even though Love is identical to Truth / Being / Consciousness / Nothingness
</p>

<p>
	There are aspects of the Absolute even though it is ONE.

<p>
	This is precisely incorrect.
</p>

<p>
	You guys need to appreciate that I am pointing to something deeper which you are as yet missing.
</p>

<p>
	I would not make such a big deal out of this if it wasn't really fucking important.
</p>

<p>
	Not all spiritual paths lead to the same place. Some paths and teachings lead deeper than others.
</p>

<p>
	If I am emphasizing something to this degree, it's not a mere word game, it's something massive you're missing.
</p>

<p>
	I can lead a donkey to water, but I cannot make you drink.
</p>

<p>
	The word Love is used precisely because that's what it is. No other word is correct for this aspect of consciousness. To use other words just to appeal to egos would be a corruption of the highest truth.
</p>

<p>
	This corruption comes from lack of understanding. The truth is just too radical for people to accept. Even so called enlightened people. They can still deny love.
</p>

<p>
	How can God reveal itself to you when you are so adamant in denying it?
</p>

<p>
	Many people live with a lot of repressed emotional baggage and truama that they have been in denial about for years.
</p>

<p>
	It can be painful to open those old wounds.
</p>

<p>
	But this is by no means unique to psychedelics. Intense meditation can also cause such problems.
</p>

<p>
	Purifying the mind is not always a walk in the park. Especially if you have a dirty mind.

I remember making a big deal about if someone is going to foolish to believe in siddhis, then what wouldnt they believe in?

			It was when I started researching the energetic traditions like Chi-gung, Taoism, Reiki and some sects of Yoga and Buddhism, I noticed that they used similar techniques of combining breathwork, visualization and intention. That is when the crack formed in my skepticism. I decided to have an open mind, keep researching and here I am.

	From what I understand grenade launcher attachments for AR-15's are still legal and easily obtainable. But the grenade rounds are illegal and hard to find. It varies a lot by state. California banned a lot of stuff. But Nevada is like the wild wild west. We have the laxest gun laws in the country.
