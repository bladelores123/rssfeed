	The astounding thing is that understanding is possible.

<p>
	Everything can be understood.

</p>

<p>
	Just look at enlightened people throughout history. Did they continue having sex? YES! YES! YES! How could they have sex if they did not desire it?
</p>

<p>
	You can figure this stuff out through simple deduction.

<p>
	Well obviously. That's not even the future, that's already today.
</p>

<p>
	Life in the real future will be so different it will be impossible to understand it for today's humans. There will be things far beyond humans or even living creatures. Stuff in totally new dimensions as yet unimaginable.
</p>

<p>
	I forsee a future where beings can materialize physical objects using their will and imagination through no physical mechanism. Imagine building a jumbo jet using your mind and it appears before you. With enough intelligence that should be possible. That is how God does it.

<p>
	Getting lost in the map is much more problematic than getting lost in the territory. Finding your way out of a forrest is easy compared to finding your way out of your own mind. The forrest doesn't play devilish tricks on you the way your own mind does.

</p>

<p>
	Yeah, it helps to have a deep theoretical foundation in spirituality to make sense of experiences like this.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, nonduality is so radical it does not make sense to the lowercase self. Takes a lot of trips to make sense of it all.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics make it much easier as that breathing is hard work and gets pretty messy. The breathing works more at the bodily level than the mental/understanding level. That's still useful, but don't be surprised if it doesn't make sense.

<p>
	When you fully realize what ego is, it will be like you were never even born. It will not even be possible in that moment to imagine that there could ever be a self or a human.
</p>

<p>
	A human is 100% a total illusion, including birth, death, mind, body, and biographical life. None of it has any reality whatsoever. There is no such thing as biological creatures who are born, live, and die. All that is imagination.
</p>

<p>
	But you can't understand this at all from your current state of consciousness. Your current state of consciousness IS the imagination at work, locking in "reality". Whatever it imagines is "real" for you right now.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	5-MeO is almost too powerful for such questions. You will be in such a degree of consciousness that your old life will have zero import or meaning. Your old life will simply not make any sense because it is pure illusion. Under 5-MeO human life simply does not compute. It's like looking at a 2D object from the 4th dimension. Your only desire will be to share 5-MeO with the whole world.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms or LSD are milder and better for asking such questions.

Ask when you are in a state of nondual God consciousness. See what comes up.

</p>

<p>
	But just in case, keep an eye on that desire of yours. Desire is a tricky thing. Desire and attachment go hand in hand. Developing a "good" spiritual ego is a common way to avoid actual awakening.
</p>

<p>
	But after you awaken you can certainly have a life purpose focused around promoting justice.

Yes, part of it is genuine but part of it is also ego.
</p>

<p>
	On some level you still don't accept or love terrorism and war. Which is a self-hatred. You have to make sure that you're changing the world not as a reaction against some part of it which you refuse to accept.
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious of why war is necessary? Of what function it serves?
</p>

<p>
	If what you seek is one half of a duality, like peace/war, then that will not work. What's necessary is to transcend both of those and discover Peace as an Absolute which unifies and embraces peace/war. That is how you get true Peace.
</p>

<p>
	See, the problem is that the terrorist too is busy creating a good world, from his POV. Everything who tries to change the world for the better is in danger of falling into the trap of the lesser jihad.
</p>

<p>
	The desire to do good cannot be taken on blind faith since a devil always frames what he does as good. Good intentions are not enough to create a good world. You also have to be aware of how goodness is relative.
</p>

Keep doing that and soon you'll be ready for deep metaphysical epiphanies.

<p>
	The emotional work is all part of this same path.

<p>
	Be patient, pace yourself, this is a marathon not a sprint. It's all good.

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15672-ashlyn/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="15672" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15672-ashlyn/" rel="">@Ashlyn</a> I see. Sounds like you're resisting something.
</p>

<p>
	Have you tried contemplating what the root issue is? As in: why do you feel the need to do that?
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately what you want to do here is to become conscious that all the above is something that YOU ARE DOING. Right now you're not conscious that you are doing it, in the sense that it feels like something that is happening to you. To change this, you must take ownership of it. So step 1 is: "Okay, I suspect I am doing this, but I'm not sure how or why", and step 2 is: "Okay, now let me get to the rock bottom of why I am doing this. What does it get me? How is it serving me? What is it protecting me from? What bad thing would happen if I stopped doing it?"
</p>

<p>
	Sit down with a journal, set aside a couple hours, and really bore into this. You want to get to the rock bottom of it so that you're clear and conscious of what it is and why it is. It's clearly serving your survival in some fashion. As you investigate this, the goal is not to go back into your past and find justifications or causes. It doesn't really matter what happened in the past. What matters is why you still feel the need to keep doing it today.
</p>

<p>
	If you are able to reach the rock bottom, you should feel some release. But you have to actually reach the true source of this, not just some ideas or opinions. You need the actual source. And the source may not be what you think it is. It is often something counter-intuitive like a belief such as: I am fundamentally unlovable, or, I am afraid I will die, or, I am worthless, or, I am afraid that if I give my love freely it will kill me, or, I need money to be happy, etc.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I'd contemplate this deeply sober. Then I would take some mushrooms or LSD and contemplate it again during the trip until the issue because very clear. Psychedelics are perfect for this kind of self-reflective work.
</p>

<p>
	Fundamentally what's happening here is that the ego is sabotaging itself because it has a deeply flawed understanding of itself and life. The ego is stuck in some sort of unconscious survival pattern which it feels it needs.
</p>

<p>
	You could also try to address this issue from a somatic perspective. See my video: Shamanic Breathing and use that technique every day for a week and see what comes up. That should open up various blockages in your body.
</p>

<p>
	Practices like Hatha yoga might be helpful for you. Also see my video on Body Awareness. It sounds like you live too much in your head and are disconnected from your body. Body awareness practices can reconnect you with your body.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	And people don't even confuse love with the Absolute. Just the opposite. People vehemently resist the notion that love could be an Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	People are just driven by emotions like robots because they never bother to contemplate or be mindful of their emotions.

Oneness is trying to grasp itself but can't ever succeed in total. How can a blanket grasp itself totally? It can only grasp itself partially. To grasp itself totally is must simply be itself (without any grasping). And that is enlightenment.

<p>
	Actually, all symbols are just territory. There are maps proper. A map is what you get when you confuse part of the territory for another part of the territory.
</p>

<p>
	To make this real clear: if you draw a map of Florida in the sand on a beach in Florida, your map is literally Florida. There isn't a map + Florida. There is only Florida, which includes within it a smaller version of itself drawn in the sand. So what it means for Florida to be Florida is that is has drawings of itself within itself.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the fractal nature of how this works.
</p>

<p>
	Now expand this out to reality itself. A thought/image/symbol of reality is itself a part of reality. Such that all you have in the end is reality. All you have is the territory. So in fact: the map is the territory! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Strange loops are not a bug here, they are a feature. They arise due to the self-reference problem: when you have only one thing in existence, how can it point to itself? There cannot be a duality between map/territory. Symbols cannot stand outside reality because they are within reality and because there is nothing outside reality. Inside and outside are of course one.

			The question I raise as far as when the tables will really turn and the world really get's moving is when this stuff penetrates into mainstream culture. Stage Blue people in middle and southern end of the United States don't really seem to feel the magnitude of this technological revolutions because they're not really around it. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I think you underestimate its impact. Technology is always affecting culture, even in the rural South. Do they not have internet? Are they not affected by globalization? Are they not affected by Muslim migrants? Will they not be affected by driverless cars in 10 years? Are they not affected by closing factories and jobs moving to China? Are they not affected by Amazon 2-day shipping? Are they not affected by smart phones? Are they not affected by gay rights? Are they not affected by Youtube?
</p>

<p>
	You can't hide technology. Once it's mainstream it's everywhere around the world within a few years.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear, the effects of technology are not always positive. It's always a mixed bag. Stuff is changing very quickly now so there will be a lot of problems for people who are not quick adapters (which is most people). The faster one's environment changes the more mentally flexible and openminded one has to be to adapt to it. This is very big problem for stage Blue.
</p>

<p>
	All the political shifts we're seeing lately are directly connected to technological advancement.
</p>

<p>
	The 60's revolution itself was made possible by the technological developments of modern chemistry and psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Now try to imagine what might happen if 5-MeO-DMT went mainstream.

<p>
	In the 60's the US was extremely Blue. Green was very radical in the 60's. There was a huge backlash to it. And it really only emerged in California and the most advanced cities. You have to understand that what shapes culture via the media is not representative of the average people. Many people in rural America are still very Blue. They are the Fox News audience.
</p>

<p>
	Probably 70%+ of the world is at stage Blue or below. Hollywood media is not representative of that, giving a skewed picture of progress. Most people in the world are still racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and nationalist. Basically 70% of the world population is at the level of development of Nazis. Think about that.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/5437-immortal-peace/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="5437" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/5437-immortal-peace/" rel="">@Immortal peace</a> You're sort of conflating two issues there, existential issues with mundane survival issues.
</p>

<p>
	If you care about survival there's no escaping that you will have to handle those survival issues. For example if you're starving and you have no money or food, no amount of meditation will fix that issue. But what meditation can do is allow you to die in peace. How? Well, you'd need to become very good at meditation or you'd need to awaken to realize that death is an illusion. The body will die from lack of food, but you as God will not.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the body to be alive there's no escaping finding food.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why spirituality is not an escape from everyday obligations. That's a bad way to look at it. You want to get masterful at handling survival issues. Which in your case means: design a way to make a decent living. Don't try to offload this issue on meditation or enlightenment. Learning how to earn a decent living is a whole skillset. It's tempting to think that you can avoid developing such skillets through "finding peace" via spirituality. That's a bad approach.
</p>

<p>
	As your practice spirituality though, even though you'll still have tricky survival issues to deal with, you will deal with them more calmly and effectively. They won't stress you out as much as they would otherwise because in the end you know that whatever happens will be okay. And you will have more emotional self-control.
</p>

<p>
	A simple way to calm yourself is to breath slowly and deeply for a few minutes or hours.
</p>

<p>
	Sedona Method is also really good for clearing out emotions.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be emotional mastery without enlightenment. Emotional mastery is even harder than enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	But if you just want to do some basic self-help stuff and work on emotional issues, yes, you can do that. You ain't gonna be anywhere near understanding the true nature of emotions. But it can be helpful.

<p>
	You must understand that all such texts are highly context-sensitive. So you don't just robotically send such a text randomly to a girl.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I once sent that exact scorpion text to a girl because the day before at the bar she told me that she had scorpion pests in her neighborhood (she lived in Vegas). So it was a great text for her.
</p>

<p>
	If you think that text is sexual that's you reading that into it.

<p>
	Like I keep saying over and over again, enlightenment is not a binary thing, nor is it the only important factor. Spiral development stages are equally important and they are independent of enlightenment. You can have an enlightened Buddha who's also a racist and misogynist because he's at Spiral stage Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not going to unwire all of your beliefs, habits, or worldviews. If you thought the Earth was flat before enlightenment, you will probably still think the Earth is flat after enlightenment.

<p>
	Yeah, I think that's possible to some extent.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is already that technology in powdered form.
</p>

<p>
	It still won't be that easy in practice because to deeply awaken your entire mind has restructure itself. It's not as simple as cutting a few wires. Your entire web of beliefs needs to be reconfigured too. Otherwise it will be a half-assed enlightenment leading to Zen devirly and pathology. And awakening alone is not enough, there is also the need for Spiral development which cannot happen simply through some surgery or even a chemical.
</p>

<p>
	There are all sorts of rare and interesting abnormal brain case studies. For example some people can hallucinate monkeys or see the world as a cell-shaded cartoon. Some people convinced that other people are robots. The brain/mind is a very tricky thing. Enlightenment is far from the only interesting mystical thing that the brain can do.

Sure, those monks are badasses, but I doubt how much of reality they really understand or how Spirally developed and well-rounded they are. I would bet most of them are underdeveloped on the Spiral, which would be a great shame.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, running marathons has little to do with insight, development, or understanding. Don't automatically assume that doing brutal rigorous mechanical training methods will get you to the highest levels of understanding. I highly doubt it would. I am much more in favor of a thoughtful contemplative approach which incorporates study of psychology, sociology, semiotics, science, etc. I think some of the hardcore Eastern schools are not thoughtful and scientific enough. They can be too grounded in tradition for tradition's sake without evolving with technology and the times.

			Do you think that certain insights like Absolute Infinity (and potentially many more) are not possible to access with 40+ years mindfulness or self-enquiry? Do you think that maybe only through substances like 5 Meo Dmt can you truly go so deep that you become conscious of these things?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, I think it's definitely possible, just very, very rare and difficult. Yogis and sages have definitely accessed the highest levels of awakening without any chemical assistance. I suspect though that they were exceptionally gifted, whether due to genetics, karma, past-lives, upbringing, the right brain chemistry, luck or a combination of all the above. I don't know exactly why some people are exceptionally spiritually gifted. That is still a deep mystery waiting for an answer.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO just makes it so much easier and more accessible to ordinary people.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend a hybrid approach.

</p>

<p>
	What I meant was, he's still missing a few deeper layers of awakening like Absolute Infinity and Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Last time I spoke with him I asked him why reality exists and he was not able to give me an answer. Nor was he aware of Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I still consider him enlightened. Just not at the highest level of understanding possible because I've clearly become conscious of why reality exists. So I know it can be done. Just probably not through mindfulness meditation and labeling.
</p>

<p>
	Being aware of God is one thing. Being aware of the mechanics of God is another yet deeper thing. There is a lot of important stuff to discover about the mechanics of God. How does God actually materialize reality? And why? This can all be understood and it is worthwhile to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take this to be anything negative against Shinzen. He's still great.
</p>

	Hehe, that's mostly what self-help as a field/industry is. That's okay. It's mostly geared towards stage Orange/Green folks. There are still very important lessons there, just don't expect it to come anywhere near the depth of the stuff I teach.
</p>

<p>
	Most self-help does not include a metaphysical, epistemological, or spiritual component. As a result, it cannot possibly be profound or an ultimate solution. But I'm still a big fan of even that type of basic stage Orange self-help. People really need it in our society. In fact, most people who follow me probably need it more than they need my metaphysical musings. Metaphysical stuff is quite advanced and assumes you've already handled other basic parts of life.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Reddit is not a high-quality source of life advice. You should expect a lot of keyboard-jockeys there. For the best advice, read quality books.
</p>

<title>Is the universe just a mind/thought of God?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Whatever thoughts arise in your human head/mind are of course God's doing. God does not think somewhere elsewhere from human minds. When God is thinking, it's using a human to do it because thinking requires form. So God as a formless entity technically cannot think unless it first materializes a human who then becomes a vehicle for thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	So you might say that God as formlessness cannot do anything at all, but at the same time it can materialize all of physical reality and then whatever physical reality does, is equivalent to God doing stuff.
</p>

<p>
	So formless God cannot eat a cheeseburger (because eating is form), but it can spawn a Big Bang, wait 14 billion years, spawn a cow, spawn a human, spawn a chef who cooks the cheeseburger, and then have the human eat the cheeseburger. That's how God eats cheeseburgers <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	God as formlessness lives vicariously through all form. Remember, form and formlessness are identical. So God literally is the taste of the cheeseburger. Ta-da! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Or think of it this way: when you're playing a video game you cannot directly enter the world of Mario as a human. But you can live through that world as the Mario character. To manipulate Mario's world requires that you use Mario as the interface. You become Mario while also being a human who's distinct from Mario. Mario can die but it does not harm you.

I don't think he is ultimately awakened, but he doesn't need to be in order to teach what he teaches, and he's more than enough awake for you. He's an excellent meditation teacher.

</p>

<p>
	Each trip will go deeper and deeper, and wider and wider. There will certainly be significant cumulative effects.
</p>

<p>
	With this method you're cramming years of spiritual growth into a single week. So be prepared for some ego-backlash and unexpected stuff. In a sense it must disrupt your old life. This can be both great and problematic when you return.
</p>

<p>
	I highly recommend it for very serious, seasoned spiritual aspirants with a very solid theoretical and practical foundation, and high emotional maturity. Not for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be too surprised if this kind of work makes your depressive or even suicidal for a while. You need to be stable enough to weather such storms. The payoffs though are HUGE.
</p>

<p>
	To handle a solid week of 5-MeO requires pushing yourself. The ego will want to stop somewhere half-way through as it gets overwhelmed with Truth.

<p>
	That's not good enough. It doesn't count unless it's direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you ARE the one moving the fingers. Who else is there but YOU? You are all there is! You are the entire universe moving those fingers. The only problem is that you've confused yourself with being limited to a human body/mind. Start thinking of yourself as the entire universe. That will help a bit to give you proper perspective. But merely thinking you are the universe is still not enough. You must directly experience that it is so. This requires awakening. The boundary between self and word must collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to just believe me. Belief is the enemy here, even if it's positive belief or belief in nonduality. True nonduality is not a belief.

</p>

<p>
	You must break through the illusion of knowledge. No knowledge is actually possible.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot take science at face value in this work. You MUST contemplate for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Even more fundamentally, all human language is circular. And science is a human language. You cannot do science, math, or logic without language.
</p>

<p>
	So really what you should start contemplating is, What the fuck is language? How is language possible AT ALL?

<p>
	Actually no scientific variable is every clearly defined.
</p>

<p>
	Science has no definition for matter, gravity, energy, time, space, or any other fundamental property of nature. Because reality is groundless and nondual it is impossible to define. Any definition is partial, circular, and ultimately groundless.
</p>

<p>
	Check for yourself. What is energy exactly? What is matter? What is time? If you investigate this you'll discover that no scientist actually knows. You'll just be chasing your own tail. All scientific definitions must be circular. Energy is defined in terms of the unknowns of time, space, and matter. Matter is defined in terms of the unknowns of energy, time, and space. Time is defined in terms of the unknowns of matter, energy, and space. Space is defined in terms of the unknowns of time, energy, and matter. In this way, nothing is truly ever known but an illusion of knowing is created like a house of cards.
</p>

Contemplate your own examples.
</p>

<p>
	For example: Einstein's theory of General Relativity is only true at macro levels. It does not work at the micro levels of quantum mechanics. But even if it did, that still wouldn't make a difference because General Relativity is not true in your dreams or in a video game.
</p>

<p>
	And in the end, it's still only an approximation at best of only certain kinds of physical phenomena. There are a trillion things which General Relativity does not account for.
</p>

<p>
	Not to even mention that General Relativity is not possible at all outside the context of the human mind. General Relativity literally does not exist for a donkey. Because General Relativity is a symbolic human invention and projection onto reality. The remarkable thing is that it has any predictive power at all (but again, only relative to human life and human consciousness).

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, scientific models are NOT based on formal logic. Again, "formal logic" is a loaded word. There are an infinite number of different formal logics. So which one are you gonna base your scientific model on? They all contradict each other. You must do empirical research to determine whether your logic squares with reality. Often times it won't!
</p>

<p>
	In quantum mechanics particles do not follow Aristotelian binary logic. So physics has long ago debunked the naive notion that reality follows binary logic.
</p>

<p>
	The question of What is science? and How come science works? is a very tricky one. It takes decades of study and contemplation to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	In short, scientific models contain very partial and limited relative truths. They are true only under very very narrow circumstances and contexts. Just because some aspects of reality are predictable does not mean that reality is logical. In fact it tends to work the other way around: Whatever humans call "logical" is however reality happens to behave in contexts which are relevant to humans. For example, if chairs had a habit of turning spontaneously into cats whenever you sat on them, your mind would grow accustomed to that behavior and call it "logical".
</p>

<p>
	In practice, what you call "logical" is just whatever reality happens to do around you. If everyone you knew walked around naked on the street, you'd eventually start calling that logical. Because in fact it is impossible to distinguish between logical and illogical things. That is a matter of relative perspective. What's logical to me is not logical to you, and vice versa. Or to put it another way, YOU are the sole arbiter of what counts as logical. Whatever you insist is logical, becomes logical (for you). Whatever you insist is illogical becomes illogical (for you). Logic has no normative power. So if someone wants to be "illogical", they are free to do so and no amount of reasoning, argumentation, or evidence will convince them otherwise. Because they are only "illogical" relative to your judgment of them. They are not illogical in any absolute sense.
</p>

<p>
	There actually exists no standard to determine what counts as logical. It must be this way because reality is nondual and empty/groundless. Anyone who tries to ground reality in logic will fail. This was rigorously demonstrated back in the early 20th century. Logical positivism and the attempt to formalize reality with a finite system of symbols failed spectacularly. As it should have. Reality is not quantifiable or formalizable.

<title>Is Logic True?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/34095-is-logic-true/?do=findComment&amp;comment=410037</link>

<p>
	You have to be very careful to distinguish formal logic from the word "logic" as it is commonly used in mainstream culture.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly formal logic is not what you use to run your life. Not anywhere close it.
</p>

<p>
	And even in the case of formal logic, did you know that there are an infinite number of different formal logical systems with varying truths? So which one are you gonna say is the truest one? How will you decide? By using some meta-logic? But then there are an infinite number of meta-logical systems with varying truths. So you'll need a meta-meta-logic, and so on to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	As Kurt Godel proved, no logical system which is complete is consistent. And no logical system which is consistent is complete. This is because Truth is infinite and cannot be captured in a finite set of symbols.
</p>

<p>
	Most people who tout themselves as being "logical" have no clue what logic really is and its limits. In everyday life the ego co-opts logic to commit devilry. Even the craziest and most deluded people think they are being "logical". So how can you trust logic then? You could think you are being perfectly logical whilst you are totally deluded. So logic is no guarantor of truth.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Contemplate: What is logic?
</p>

<p>
	It certainly isn't true in any absolute sense.

	I will do some meta politics topics in the future where we look at the fundamentals of what politics is, how it works, and how it fits with spirituality.

<title>Subscribing to no religion while parents want you to go to church</title>

<p>
	Classic conflict of stage Blue vs stage Orange
</p>

<p>
	That can be difficult if your parents are solid Blue. They will not be openminded enough to allow it. But you might be able to convince them.
</p>

<p>
	You could try to explain to them how meditation will lead you to God. And then when they go to church you stay home and do meditation. Emphasize the mystical aspects of their religion. Every serious religious practitioner does meditation/prayer/contemplation. Guide their religiosity to spirituality.

Sleep is unconsciousness, awakening is consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	After you awaken deeply you can be conscious even during deep sleep. It's sorta like existing in a pure void.
</p>

<p>
	Sleep is a tricky thing. The fact is you don't really know what sleep is. That requires contemplation.

<p>
	You are talking about an imagined unconscious state. I am talking about total consciousness.

If it's dualistic it can still have some nuts of wisdom, but it will also contain a lot of misguided things.
</p>

<p>
	If you're using impure sources you will waste a lot of time sorting the the truth from the delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes I start reading a book, see too much dualistic delusion, and just stop reading. Such an impure source is not worth the effort to untangle when crystal clear sources exist.

<p>
	Be careful. Just because someone is a mystic or is enlightened does not automatically put them at Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of Spiral Dynamics is to differentiate between stages of development and awakening. They are not always correlated.
</p>

<p>
	Don't just assume that your favorite sage/mystic is Turquoise.

<p>
	Using the mind properly requires serious training, otherwise it falls into gross delusions.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately almost nobody teaches how to properly use the mind. People either teach how great the mind is, or how terrible the mind is, but not how to use the mind wisely.
</p>

<p>
	You are confused about who/what you are. This is how most normal people are. At the same time they identify with being the body, the mind, and also not that. They are unsure and confused. The mind plays these games where one minute it thinks its the body, another minute it thinks its a human, another minute it thinks its the voice heard in the head, another minute it thinks it was born, another minute it thinks its some kind of "soul", another minute it thinks its God, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of self-inquiry is to become very strict with yourself and force yourself to confront this shell game that the mind plays. What are you REALLY? Not as a belief, but what the fuck are you? If you claim that you are real, then you must be able to clearly specify what is it that's real. The body? The voice? The memories of childhood? The feelings of pain? If we put a gun to your head right now, what is it that you fear will die? << That is the false self.
</p>

<p>
	Getting clear about the false self is just as important as discovering the True Self. You can't disidentify with something unless you first clearly realize that you're identified with it. You might be identified with your childhood memories and not even realize it. So you have to ask yourself very seriously, "Am I identified with my childhood memories? Is that what I actually am?" And so forth with any other possible identifications until you eliminate them all. What will remain is nothing, which is what you actually are.

<title>What's the difference between complete mockery and spiritual teachings?</title>

</p>

<p>
	In the meantime you can study theory and maintain a mild daily practice of 30-60 minutes. You can also do a few yearly meditation retreats or psychedelic retreats.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes in this work you must inch your way up. Be creative. Find ways which fit your existing obligations.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't fool yourself into thinking that watching Borat is spiritual work. You must be brutally honest about whether the techniques you're using are actually raising your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind will most-definitely misinterpret truth. Ignorance cannot help being ignorant. You can count on that.
</p>

<p>
	By understanding this you will be a little less likely to do it. But you will still not be immune.
</p>

<p>
	You must be careful and study many high-quality sources, and think for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Also understand that mistakes are part of the process. No one walks the spiritual path without making some mistakes. Trial and error is how we grow. The key is to stay vigilant enough to correct yourself. You need to have enough theory under your belt to know when you've veered off course.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to be a bit deluded here or there so long as you know what the right course ultimately is.

</p>

<p>
	Try Nagarjuna or Plotinus instead.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, there is A LOT of dualistic delusion within Western philosophy, so be careful not to waste your time wading through bullshit. Go straight for the highest nondual teachings.
</p>

<p>
	You can easily spend 20 years reading Western philosophy and still not get any closer to Truth. With that said, there is the occasional gem and I still encourage everyone to think through philosophical questions for themselves. Philosophy is not meant to be read or believed, it must be DONE! -- as in: contemplate everything for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The power of philosophy lies more in the questions than in the answers. If you are not contemplating for yourself, you are not actually doing any philosophy.

</p>

<p>
	You are framing what I said as "This is so inauthentic and artificial". But once you actually internalize the skill of proper texting, it will become authentic and natural.
</p>

<p>
	Every skill you learned was at one point inauthentic and artificial, from mathematics to reading to writing to typing on the computer.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying you need to keep a file of canned text messages. Once you understand the principles of texting with a girl, you can generate an infinite number of spontaneous texts. Without learning this skill, your text messages will suck and you will lose girls by committing stupid mistakes which only years later will you understand why.
</p>

<p>
	People expect to be good at sex and dating "naturally" without any deliberate practice. Because love is supposed to be "natural". This is a silly double-standard. Nowhere else in life do you adopt this attitude. If you want to be good at something you must train and recognize principles. Girls will appreciate it when you don't creep them out with your texts.
</p>

It's too radical and it requires serious focus.
</p>

<p>
	You will not wake up without scheduling some week-long retreats every year. Waking up requires intense and prolonged focus. 60 minutes of focus will not do it.
</p>

<p>
	Or try psychedelics. That's the most realistic way for ordinary people to get a taste of awakening. It's fast amd effective, unlike meditation.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, you can still maintain a daily meditation habit.

<p>
	It requires a change in state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The sense of I is more than just a feeling, thought, or belief. It's an entire state of being such that you know no other possibility.
</p>

<p>
	Changing that state requires a lot of concentration practice, or kriya yoga, or psychedelics.

			Then I see what other guys write to girls, like really "gay" stuff with heart smileys and shit. And girls seem to go crazy for it, these guys have a deeper connection with her than the guy who only writes her in a matter-of-fact style and then tries to get physical out of the blue.
		</p>

		<p>
			Havent you seen that when a girl fancies a guy they text each other all the time, shes constantly on her phone. A PUA would tell you to never do that and ignore her. I listened to this PUA stuff, set all these rules for myself what to do and what not to do and it backfired in my face every time. I'm still working on getting all these PUA concepts out of my head, its pure neurotic poison, thats just what it is.
		</p>

		<p>
			I think your advice on this topic is heavily biased by your PUA phase Leo. No offense at all but I think If dating happened naturally and not in a forced way as a PUA late in your 20s I think your advice on this would be A LOT different.

<p>
	I was only talking about pre-sex communications. Once you have sex with her, then you can text her more seriously.
</p>

<p>
	You must distinguish between pre-sex and post-sex behaviors. They are very different.
</p>

<p>
	Pre-sex, while you're dating, there must be some gaming going on. After she falls in love with you, you can cut the gaming.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to manipulate her too much via text. The key is not to display neediness and desperation. The biggest mistake made with pre-sex texting is that the guy fucks it up by trying to say too much, trying to be too edgy/cocky/funny. Trying to attract her via text doesn't work. So actually my advice is to not game girls via text. Use texting mostly to handle dating logistics laced with bits of humor.
</p>

<p>
	Make your texts totally non-needy and unimportant. Don't be sending her long letters via text. Never try to logically convince her of meeting you. All that crap will blow you out very fast.
</p>

<p>
	Here are good kinds of texts pre-sex:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Hey gurl, let's grab a coffee.
	</li>
	<li>
		Coffee! Lets go
	</li>
	<li>
		Saw this shirt at Walmart and thought it would be perfect for you [insert pic of ugly shirt]
	</li>
	<li>
		Meow...
	</li>
	<li>
		Moo
	</li>
	<li>
		Hey dork
	</li>
	<li>
		Let's hang out
	</li>
	<li>
		When you free this week?
	</li>
	<li>
		Let's do something this week
	</li>
	<li>
		How's the recovery going? (from last night's club/bar)
	</li>
	<li>
		You're the weirdest gurl I met last night.
	</li>
	<li>
		I want to build you a mansion out of Legos and stock it with exotic baby animals.
	</li>
	<li>
		Reading a book
	</li>
	<li>
		Chillin by the pool
	</li>
	<li>
		Making juice
	</li>
	<li>
		Clipping my toe nails, thought you should know
	</li>
	<li>
		Trimming my nose hair, thought you should know
	</li>
	<li>
		Going to club XXXXX tonight. You?
	</li>
	<li>
		You remind me of a dog I just saw
	</li>
	<li>
		You seem great and all but I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with you. I bet you snore like a pig.
	</li>
	<li>
		I want to stick a scorpion in your pants
	</li>
	<li>
		Hope this isn't too forward but I mailed you this basket of puppies [insert pic of basket of puppies]
		<ul>
			<li>
				A few of them might arrive dead, I was too cheap to swing for overnight shipping
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That kind of stuff. Keep it lite and chill. Zero investment is key.
</p>

<p>
	This is the extent of pre-sex texting.
</p>

<p>
	NEVER, EVER get sexual via text unless you've already had sex with her a few times. It comes off way too creepy and needy. Act like you don't care about sex.
</p>

A narrative.
</p>

<p>
	But there is a True You -- the True Self/No-Self/Nothingness/Void/God. Your true nature is not human but God. You are God thinking it is Paul. So when you realize that you are actually God, you will also realize that God has Will. God has infinite Will, in fact. Paul's will is a tiny splinter off God's infinite Will.
</p>

<p>
	So in a sense you will discover Paul was never really in control.
</p>

<p>
	But then you will also discover that since you are God, you control and create everything. As God, you have Will which you can use to create. So literally God allocates a tiny percentage of its infinite Will to this body of Paul's so that it could create a life. As a human your creative capacities are not infinite, they are limited so long as you are in a human form. If you exit the human form your creative power will be infinite, you can literally materialize physical objects out of thin air. But at this point you're not a human any more, you are the Godhead. You are that which you were before you were born.
</p>
