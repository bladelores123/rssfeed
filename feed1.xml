<p>
	No because creation is endless. God itself cannot ever reach its own end because it has no beginning or end.
</p>

<p>
	You can count up the natural numbers forever without ever repeating one. Give it a try.

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	There is only your mind.
</p>

<p>
	But your mind is identical to the whole world and other people.
</p>

<p>
	You imagine the entire universe because you are God pretending to be human. You are one. There cannot be anything outside of you.
</p>

<p>
	All outsides are inside your mind.

<title>kambo healing</title>

<p>
	Kambo will make you vomit your guts out.
</p>

<p>
	But that can be healing.
</p>

<p>
	You can use the search function to find some old threads about peoples' experiences with it.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't expect it to heal serious things like Alzheimers. But it might heal you at the mental/spiritual level, helping you shed some ego.
</p>

<p>
	Kambo is not a psychedelic at all. It is a poison. It's basically like deliberately getting bit by a snake just for the experience.
</p>

<p>
	When you are being aware that you are human, you are actually misunderstanding what you are. You are imagining that you are human, in the same way that you could imagine that you are a kangaroo. But that doesn't make you a kangaroo. Only in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you are God. But you are too busy imagining you are human to notice this. The human obscures the God like clouds the sun.

<p>
	As you do more of this work you will become more compassionate with regards to the needless suffering of others.
</p>

<p>
	You need a heart awakening to really start to care about people. Most peoples' hearts are so closed and all they care about is themselves. But you cannot create a well-functioning and healthy community that way.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a family in which no one cared about the others. It would be a toxic disaster.

</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean you can't be passionate about your LP.
</p>

<p>
	But also, if you're first starting to become conscious of the existential Emptiness of life, that will likely rob you of motivation and make you depressed for a short period of time until you integrate it and the ego gets over it.
</p>

<p>
	A sense of meaninglessness and loss is a common egoic reaction to deep consciousness work. It will pass once you go deeper. It is one of the many threshold guardians which guard the deepest Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Trust that your sense of passion will come back even stronger once you fully awaken. But also be open to your passions changing and evolving. Maybe your passion for your current work will die completely but that's because some new greater passion with take its place. Be open to that.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, the ego will go through a period of mourning its own death. Just like it does with the death of a loved one. There is a period of resistance, emotional upheaval, depression, then acceptance, letting go, and moving on.
</p>

<p>
	Of course authoritarianism exists precisely because it works.
</p>

<p>
	But it only works up to a certain point.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness it stops working and becomes counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	So yes, at certain (low) levels of consciousness you have to be a dick to be successful.
</p>

<p>
	But at the highest levels of consciousness being a dick will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Not understanding that there are different levels of consciousness and that your followers have different levels of consciousness and different systems of values will make this guy's analysis and interviews incomplete.
</p>

<p>
	There are many different leadership styles which correspond to consciousness and values levels. Not to mention that you someone cannot escape being a dick if they are stuck in a certain level of consciousness. The leader himself has to grow massively to stop being authoritarian and yet remain effective. This is not easy to do for most people. Which is why its so rare and authoritarianism and abuse of power is so common.

<p>
	Smoking DPT 50 times is not dangerous if done properly. Nor do you have to smoke DPT at all. You could simply do some hardcore meditation or self-inquiry.

<p>
	The ego mind desires demonstrations. Awakening has nothing to do with manipulating realty. Awakening is the realization that everything is exactly as it is.
</p>

<p>
	No one can awaken you but yourself. God will never force itself on you. I am not going to play your games of trying to change your mind because your mind is not interested in change. Your mind is closed and you are not interested in serious inquiry as is clear by your arrogant attitude and lack of serious work. If you were doing serious work you would  not be on this forum arguing with me and asking for demonstrations. You would deep in meditation & contemplation trying to realize the Truth for yourself. But you are not at this point yet because you're very early in your journey. You are skeptical, and I totally get that. But you must understand that from my POV your skepticism is as silly as a child doubting that 1+1=2. It is a waste of time to even entertain such skepticism from an awakened position. Absolute Truth is prior to any possible skepticism or doubt because it is not a function of thought, belief, or mind. Absolute Truth cannot be thought, so it cannot be doubted either.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because all "use", utility, and value is a fiction. Nothing needs to be changed. Reality is Absolute Perfection. But you are too busy looking for utility, too busy manipulating reality to awaken to this fact. You want to drag God down into the domain of survival, thinking this will prove God. But this assumes survival is a true domain. In fact, survival is the domain of falsehood so God has no business there. God does not care about survival. It is beneath God. So rather than trying to drag God down to your level you must be willing to raise yourself up to God's level.
</p>

<p>
	The will of God is EVERYTHING! That's what you don't fathom. Nothing can happen which isn't the will of God. The whole planet could die tomorrow and it would be perfectly fine. Realizing this creates liberation since there is no need to manipulate anything. Manipulation is a function of survival which is falsehood. To God it does not matter what happens because God's mind is conscious enough to see that all value and judgment is falsehood. No state of reality is better or worse than any other. So there is no need to change it. Awakening does not grant the ego the ability to manipulate the world using God's will, rather it eliminates the ego entirely, surrendering you to God will precisely as it is. It is the ego-mind which wants to use God's powers to manipulate the world. And that is precisely what God will not allow because that would be to allow devilry to flourish.
</p>

<p>
	If you wish to access God, the cost is total surrender of your self. You must give up all of your attachments and demands. Which, of course, is the last thing you want to do. You want to hijack God for your selfish purposes. If you could, you would try to use God to become a tyrant over men. You would try to use God to get sex, power, money, luxury, and everything else your impure ego craves. And this is precisely what you are denied. Because that is devilry.

<p>
	Omniscience isn't what you imagine it to be. It is not a knowledge of relative things. It is Absolute Consciousness. All knowledge is finite and relative. I don't know what you had for breakfast. But I am conscious of how I create the entire universe. That's the paradox of awakening.

<p>
	That is your problem. You fundamentally misunderstand this work. This work is not about me convincing you of anything. This work requires that you be willing to surrender your arrogant mind in a personal search for Truth. You have to want the Truth so bad that it will literally kill you.

			I am also curious about one more thing. I remember watching a video of yours where you stated that science will be done non-symbolically 500 years from now. What did you mean by that exactly? Are you thinking that the nondual paradigm would affect scientific research traditions for the better? Can you give me a brief sketch of what this would look like, especially in areas like neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology and fundamental physics?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Science and mysticism will start to merge. The greatest scientists will be those who can access non-ordinary states of consciousness and have direct insight into the nature of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Science is by definition symbolic because it requires communication and coordination which cannot be done other than through language. But individual scientists can venture off by themselves and explore consciousness and bring back nuggets. The difficulty will be coordinating that with others.
</p>

<p>
	Science itself will be transcended and that transcendence of it will eventually transform what science is.
</p>

<p>
	No matter how much science you do, you will always be as far away from understand reality as you were before you started doing science. Because reality is infinite and science is finite. So you can do science forever and still never get any closer to the end. All scientific discovery is relative. Relative, but useful.
</p>

<p>
	Neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, and fundamental physics will admit that their discoveries are relative to certain states of consciousness. Fundamental physics is only true relative to an ordinary human state of consciousness and within a very narrow symbolic framework. All science is human species biased and ultimately imaginary. But imaginary things can still be useful. So it's useful for survival.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Anyhow, this will be my last communication here. I cannot teach a student who insists he is right.
</p>

<p>
	Good luck with your journey through the labyrinths of your own mind.
</p>

<p>
	I wish you total awakening.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Try to really appreciate this: your mind is deliberately tricking you not to awaken. Every thought you think is already hijacked to maintain your sense of self and reality. So when you think, "Leo is wrong" << that's already the trick.

<p>
	Selfishness always works in the short-term but crumbles in the long-term because Truth is selfless and the self is false.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same reason life always ends in death. Death is Truth so it must always win out.

<p>
	You guys love to play word games.
</p>

<p>
	When you are fully conscious that you are God, that is enlightenment/awakening. How long it lasts is irrelevant. It could last 1 minute or 100 years. For as long as you are conscious, you are awake. As soon as you are not conscious, you are asleep.
</p>

<p>
	If you are in doubt whether you're awake, you're asleep. If you have questions about what God is or means, you are asleep.

<p>
	Look at society like a family. If your mother got cancer, you would never leave her alone to die because she couldn't pay $2,000 month for her medication while you were swimming in cash and buying million dollar vacation homes and sports cars. You would not charge your mother $70,000 for treatment.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	60,000+ people die each year in America from lack of ability to pay for healthcare. Does that make any sense? Purely from a financial POV if these people didn't die think of how much tax money they would bring in over their lifetimes. It's idiotic for the government to let them die. The government is actually losing money on each death. Each person can bring in at least $5k to $10k in tax revenue each year. Not to mention the compassion angle.

<p>
	I don't feel he deeply understands Green. Because he hasn't fully gone through it.
</p>

<p>
	He's very rationalistic, materialistic, and moralistic.
</p>

<p>
	His political positions are problematic when he does his whole Islamophobia thing and his race IQ thing.
</p>

<p>
	One of the hallmarks of Yellow is non-judgment and the ability to appreciate the relativity of different perspectives. Sam has some of that, but not too deep.
</p>

<p>
	Again, he def has some Yellow, but not 100% Yellow. It's pretty pointless splitting hairs over this. You're never going to know a person's entire Spiral profile. We're just making best guesses here.

<p>
	Yes, Sam Harris is more developed than JP and of course Ben Shaprio. But Sam has plenty of Orange yet in him, and he is certainly not awake.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, he has a good deal of Yellow in him. But Yellow is not that high when we are talking about things like truth, consciousness, love, God, nonduality, spirituality, etc. Yellow is still childhood.
</p>

<p>
	Sam Harris is very moralistic and does not understand relativity. So he hasn't fully integrated Green.

<p>
	It's very simple. To be fully enlightened is to realize you are God and that you create the entire universe. If you're not conscious of that, you ain't really enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	If there is even one hair of separation between you and God, you're not fully awake.
</p>

<p>
	How you act towards others is a tangential matter. Enlightenment is not about behavior or action, it's about consciousness of what you are. You're either conscious that you are God or you're not.

<p>
	Your questions are directly part of the field of philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	Psychology will never even attempt to answer what existence is.
</p>

<p>
	But academic philosophy will also never succeed in answering what existence is. That can only be done via awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You created existence. So who are you asking? You are it!
</p>

<title>Can Enlightenment Work Cure Social Anxiety?</title>

<p>
	If you truly, fully awake, then yes. But that's so challenging and rare that you are better off working directly on your social anxiety.
</p>

<p>
	True and full awakening has the potential to cure everything. But are you willing to full awaken? Do you dare?

<p>
	Your suffering is not due to shallow breath, it's due to you attached to being you.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is attachment to a finite self.

<p>
	You can do it and you can get very creative with it. Your thinking here is just too narrow and materialistic.
</p>

<p>
	Abstract is good. Gives you lots of creative room. Your mind is just lazy with being creative. It's like you've been given a blank canvas and you are complaining there's nothing to work with.

	Own your passions and get to work.

<p>
	Of course real science relies on anecdotal evidence all the time. That's what clinical trials are. It's just very rigorous.
</p>

<p>
	But many fools have no idea how real science works.
</p>

<p>
	But yet, many scientists are far too dismissive of any modality which doesn't have a simply material physical explanation. So they will accept anecdotal evidence for a new chemical drug, but they will not for something like acupuncture.

	My brother got married off OkCupid.

<p>
	So of course it can work.
</p>

<p>
	But if you don't have the look or you want to get the best girl possible, online isn't a good strategy.
</p>

<p>
	If your look is above average or your standards are low, yes, you can gets plenty of dates online.
</p>

<p>
	But you can attract much hotter girls in person. The hottest girls are not found online.

<p>
	No! Do not even think of doing that.
</p>

<p>
	Opioid treatment requires a large flood dose. If you get the dose wrong you will kill yourself. This is no joke.

<p>
	Iboga is not like other psychedelics. You can kill the body with this one.

	Don't listen to people's opinions about psychedelics unless they've done 50+ trips.

<p>
	To say he has done psychedelics is highly deceptive. He has toyed around with them at most and has no idea what they really are or mean.
</p>

<p>
	He's too fearful and neurotic to use them properly. Same with Sam Harris.

<p>
	To be technical about it, there is no difference between life being a dream and life being real.
</p>

<p>
	Reality = dream
</p>

	So you can say the glass is half full or half empty and both are right.

<p>
	Nothing comes close to ibogaine for opioid withdrawal. Ibgaine resets the brain's opioid receptors effortlessly.
</p>

<p>
	Tell her to fly to Canada, Mexico, or Costa Rica to an ibogaine clinic.
</p>

<p>
	Ibogaine must be administered by a nurse. You cannot do it at home.

</p>

<p>
	Your desire for art and creativity is selflessness. That is your way of reconnecting with God. That is your church.
</p>

<p>
	Your only problem is your guilt and self-judgment. Let it go and pursue your art guilt-free.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let selfish people gaslight you or make you feel guilty. You fell for the gaslighting.

			Its a truly eye opening experiece, within hours you will get hundreds of matches and women will actively contact you. You can say the most braindead/evil/boring stuff and they wont loose interest. Just opening with "Sex?" will get a positive answer. A guy like this can arrange sex with 10+ different girls by putting in 1 hour of half assed effort.

<p>
	This is totally true because online dating is 100% about looks. Nothing else matters.
</p>

<p>
	When you post a pic of yourself online, that's all you're reducing yourself down to.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not a classically handsome guy, this is a terrible strategy for you because you are not displaying your other great qualities. Your strategy must be to get hot girls in-person with your personality, not your looks. Girls respond very differently in-person.
</p>

<p>
	Online is the lazy man's game. If you are lazy with game, don't be surprised when your results look lazy too.
</p>

<p>
	The bulk of a man's attractiveness is in his personality and the life he's built. So to reduce yourself to a profile pic is like selling a diamond at a dollar store.

			Does anyone on here do regular solo camping? Or have experience with bushcraft? If so, can you maintain spiritual practice in the wilderness? Obviously meditation would be easy, but I've always wondered whether it would be possible to do a solo bush retreat, and maintain a Hatha yoga practice. Perhaps I will take this on as my own challenge.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In practice you will be so busy just surviving in the wilderness that you will have very little time for true meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation requires completely detaching from survival. So it's actually easier to do in a well furnished home where most of your survival needs are easily handled. Ideally you'd have someone else even cook your food, so you don't get distracted. Even taking a shit is a distraction.
</p>

<p>
	Notice just how much survival distracts you.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if you just love camping or want to do it professionally, by all means. But don't confuse that with consciousness work.

	There is.

<p>
	Take a psychedelic with the intention to become conscious of all your projections, assumptions, and judgments. And be ready for a beating.
</p>

<p>
	And while you're at it, become conscious of what "other" is. You may be shocked to discover that other itself is nothing but your projection.

			Why don't these people then distinguish themselves from traditional communism?
		</p>

		<p>
			Even modern facists clearly distinguish themselves from the "nazis" we know from history books
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	First of all, they do. The problem is that the audience listening isn't intetested in making such a distinction. Conservatives and centrists like to play dumb because that serves the status quo. It serves Michael Bloomberg to think Bernie is a communist. It serves Jordan Peterson to think that trans activists are in the same category as Stalin and Lenin. Of course this is absurd. But they cannot see it because their careers and realities depend on them not seeing it.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, even Bernie and others like him are not conscious enough to understand what a distinction is. So they don't fully understand that the audience lacks the distinctions they have. Bernie takes his distinctions for granted.
</p>

<p>
	It's one thing to make a distinction, and it's a whole nother thing to know you've made a distinction and that the people you're speaking with haven't made it in their minds. That's some next level stage Yellow and Turquoise shit. Very, very few humans on this planet understand such subtle things. And it's not like you could explain it in a 2 minute CNN segment.
</p>

<p>
	Most of you here still have no idea what a distinction is, and you have been studying this stuff for years.
</p>

	Here's a very basic fact to contemplate:
</p>

<p>
	If these things did not work for some people, they would not exist.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is finding out if they work for your particular problem. They may, or may not. It depends on hundreds of factors. And the only way you'll know is by testing it yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Health issues can be very, very complex.

You can feel this inside yourself if you introspect genuinely.
</p>

<p>
	If your keep speaking from a closed mind, don't be surprised if you get banned. You're walking right on the edge. It seems from your POV that you're being intelligent and reasonable, but you are speaking from ignorance. I don't know how else to get you to understand this.
</p>

<p>
	Once again, open your mind. People here are trying to telling you about a radical truth which you have no understanding of yet. It's not personal. You just don't comprehend the depth of what consciousness is because you are asleep.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you are a dog and we are pointing to the moon and you keep biting the finger. You are missing the moon entirely. But your mind is fooling you into thinking that you know best and that you can rationalize and argue your way out of this problem. You can't. It takes the guidance of an awakened being to show you that you are asleep. But that cannot happen if your mind is closed and you keep insisting that you know best.
</p>

<p>
	You are inside of a dream. And everything your mind says maintains the "reality" of that dream. Your mind will defend, to the death, your dream. Which is what you have been doing this entire thread. But you're not conscious that you're doing it. Either start to wake up or this forum is not for you. This is a waking up forum. Arguing and reasoning will not wake you up. You have yet to realize that.
</p>

<p>
	If you have an emotional reaction to anything said here, just notice that, rather than acting from it. Those emotional reactions are your mind fooling you into staying asleep. You are ideologically attached to the notion of an objective reality because your entire life hinges on it, and yet it is entirely a fiction of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	My words are not something for you to believe or disbelieve, but to investigate. You can validate everything simply by carefully and patiently observing how your own mind works. Waking up is not a function of believing new things. All beliefs are part of the dream your mind creates. So is rationality, logic, science, and religion.
</p>

<p>
	You have to realize that there is something extremely profound that I am trying to communicate to you right now. But you have to really open your mind first in order to start to get it.
</p>

<p>
	If you fail to get the communication, that's okay. I understand. But you then need to understand that we are not going to waste our time babysitting you and over-explaining things to you here. Our time is better invested in helping those whose minds are open enough to hear the communication.
</p>

<p>
	Old school Soviet style communism of the Leninist stripe is more stage Blue than Green.
</p>

<p>
	Few people have the cognitive frameworks necessary to distinguish the difference between Blue vs Green or old-school communism vs Bernie-style Democratic Socialism.
</p>

<p>
	Even well-educated professors like Jordan Peterson fail to make such distinctions. Because their minds are closed and locked in various paradigms.
</p>

<p>
	Very, very few humans think for themselves. Mostly humans just ape other humans.

</p>

<p>
	But 5-MeO-DMT is beyond words.
</p>

<p>
	Shrooms have no limit to their potency. You can eat as much as your stomach can hold and trips forever higher. Your mind will not be able to handle it. So there's no glass ceiling potency-wise. The ceiling is your fragile mind.
</p>

<p>
	Shroom are quite challenging at higher doses. Otherwise psychedelics like 5-MeO-DMT are easier because they are clearer. Shrooms can be wacky, twisted, and confusing.
</p>

<p>
	But everyone needs to experience shrooms at least a few times in their life. They have a very magical earthy mystical quality.

	What info could you expect?
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to let all that shit go and focus on awakening to the fact that you are God.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is a radical move.
</p>

<p>
	But it's worth it in the end.

<p>
	Just want to report, 5-MeO-DMT freebase mixes well with coconut milk for plugging. The milk can reduce the burn. A few drops is all you need.
</p>

<p>
	Freebase also mixes fully in basic cooking vinegar. But vineger will sting your ass more than coconut milk. Still, not bad at all.
</p>

<p>
	You can also experiment mixing freebase in MCT oil. But oil will tend to stick more to any plastic surface like your mixing container, stirring device, and inside of the needless syringe, thus slightly reducing your dose.
</p>

<p>
	Coconut milk is nice in that it isn't sticky like oil.
</p>

<p>
	Coconut milk can also be used to reduce the pain of snorting. But you'd be a fool to snort anything once you master plugging.

And it is absolutely Absolute.

<p>
	You can be 100% conscious of what everything is. But not through science, relgion, or belief.

</p>

<p>
	Your body has exactly as much consciousness as a rock. The only difference is, you think you are a body whereas a rock does not think it is a rock.
</p>

<p>
	The reason it doesn't make sense to you is because you assume you were born. This is the key mistake. A rock isn't burdened by such an assumption.
</p>

<p>
	Your birth is imaginary. As a result of imagining your birth, you imagine consciousness belongs to you but not to a rock.
</p>

<p>
	You misunderstand the rock because you misunderstand yourself. And you misunderstand yourself because otherwise you could not be born! Your birth itself is a misunderstanding.
</p>

	Oxalate is 99% pure 5-MeO-DMT. Toad venom is less than 50% 5-MeO-DMT. The rest is other junk.

<p>
	People react to 5-MeO-DMT very differently.
</p>

<p>
	In your case I would suggest trying other psychedelics until you find one which suits you and feels good to you. Psychedelics are not supposed to feel like hell every time. They are supposed to feel wonderful. It's important to find the substance which fits you.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe after that you can revisit 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	Some chemicals just don't sit right with your body. The body metabolizes chemicals in different ways. Don't assume that all people are the same.

<p>
	These naive libertarian arguments are just silly, showing no understanding of how business or government actually works. We don't live in a libertarian fantasy.

	You are inspiring!
</p>

<p>
	Keep up the great attitude.
</p>

<p>
	Yes it's harder for you there. But it also makes you all the more rare and special.

	You're not gonna be able to earn instant money via biz. Freelancing will earn you much less than you imagine.
</p>

<p>
	I would look for a reasonable job and develop skills on the side until such time that your skills can provide genuine value to people.

	Infinity means there is no beginning or end.
</p>

<p>
	Ends are impossible.
</p>

<p>
	If you still distinguish between the beginning and end of a thing, you ain't awake.

	Have you considered that your depression is actually a disconnection from being and consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	Your pursuit of sober, practical reality is what makes you depressed, because survival is fundamentally hollow and unsatisfying. You are a hamster in a wheel.

<p>
	Definitely more philosophical.
</p>

<p>
	This is the branch of philosophy known as epistemology. It tries to answer the question: How do we know anything at all?
</p>

<p>
	Psychology doesn't go as deep. But also philosophy tends to do a lot of mental masturbation on this topic.
</p>

<p>
	Learning to accurately distinguish truth from falsehood is the most challenging endeavor the human mind can undertake because it is the linchpin which holds together reality.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully understood it, your entire sense of physical reality would collapse and you would experience "death". So very few people accurate get that far.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to reach Truth via university studies. Truth is far too radical for that.

<p>
	There are ways to be less ignorant about capitalism and relative things.

<p>
	Not many good ones. You can find a few on my book list.
</p>

<p>
	I'm working to correct that.

<p>
	Then you should be eager to read, learn, research, and contemplate stuff.

<p>
	Be open ended. You don't know what you'll discover.

<p>
	Good. But not nearly enough.
</p>

<p>
	Not-knowing is not just about admitting it, it's a whole lifestyle and state of mind.
</p>

<p>
	Try sitting for 5 minutes and just basking in I-don't-knowness.

<p>
	You can't know that ahead of time! That's the point.
</p>

<p>
	You are asking for an epistemic foundation. The nature of reality is intimately tied with everything else so it should to be avoided here.
</p>

<p>
	If you admit you don't know, you might be motivated to read some books on capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it takes work. You want a shortcut. And I am trying to show you that a shortcut here is a mistake. There is no shortcut for learning to distinguish truth from falsehood.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of reality is entangled with how you think about reality and with your survival. If these things were seperate, everything would be easy.

</p>

<p>
	But you are asking for a foundation. Do you want a foundating grounded in truth or falsehood? If truth, then your foundation must be not-knowing because that is most true for you. You do not know how to distinguish truth from falsehood. But if you want a foundation grounded in falsehood, then proceed as you were.
</p>

<p>
	I am not speaking of the Absolute here. I am speaking very practically. You do not know how to distinguish truth from falsehood even in the relative domain.
</p>

<p>
	For example, you do not even know if the Earth is flat. This has serious implications in the relative domain.
</p>

<p>
	I am not even talking about the Absolute here. You are so far from the Absolute that it's nothing but a fantasy for you at this point.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that a lot of epistemic mistakes are made in relative domain.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a foundation, it's best that your foundation not be based on falsehood. No one can give you a foundation because how would you know what they gave you is true? A foundation can only be derived by yourself through personal inquiry and contemplation.
</p>
