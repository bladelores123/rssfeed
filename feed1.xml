Forget the lofty metaphysical stuff for now, and enough watching theory. Now it's implementation time.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately there can be no shortcut for doing your pushups. You just gotta bite the bullet amd start doing them, one baby step at a time. Gradually build up your momentum.
</p>

<p>
	Yew, this work takes lots of work. Accomplishing your highest vision requires a lot of hustling.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe see my video: How To Get Shit Done. You have to be results oriented, not just theortical.
</p>

<p>
	Also see my video: Balancing Theory vs Practice.
</p>

<p>
	You are stuck in a cycle of avoiding emotional labor and there's just no advice that can let you skirt that. You cannot grow up and become successful without emotional labor.

<p>
	Game companies have gotten a lot greedier and more exploitative in the last ten years. Few games are made for the artistry any more.
</p>

<p>
	Of course indie gaming has also taken off in the last 10 years, which was great!
</p>

<p>
	Online distribution has allowed for more exploitation. With great power comes great responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	Companies like EA, Activision, Ubisoft, BioWare, Bungie, Blizzard, and Bethesda have sold their soul to the devil because they became too successful for their own good. The money corrupted the art and they will never produce the same kind of great art they once did.
</p>

<p>
	Look to small, new companies for art. You are not going to find art at McDonalds.

	Sounds like you got some special genetics.

<p>
	How your body metabolizes chemicals depends on your genetics.

<p>
	Yes, I have removed about 20-30 books which over time I felt didn't meet my quality standards. I replaced those books with better books.
</p>

<p>
	Quality is more important than quantity in this case. There are far too many books around which will waste your time.
</p>

<p>
	As I become more conscious my quality standards rise and I'm less tolerant of low-consciousness books.

<p>
	Obviously he wasn't anywhere near awakened, but his heart was in the right place and he was drawn intuitively towards Love, which resulted in his entire career and sense of life purpose. He's a great example of someone boldly following their LP.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people following their LP intuitively simply because it feels right, without an deeper existential understanding of why they're doing it. That's a fine way to get started. Later, existential understanding and consciousness work can be added on top of that to take your LP to crazy levels.

<p>
	No, it's deeper than that. The entire self/other distinction is imaginary. There is no one in the universe but yourself. By this I mean, you are the entire universe and all "others". Universal Mind imagines your body and all other bodies into existence.
</p>

<p>

			The problem is the skeptic will claim that even after taking the psychedelic and being convinced of whatever mystical truth he might simply have been tricked due to the limitations of his brain. He might say that once he has the mystical experience he will be utterly convinced of it, which is why he must avoid it to stay objective.

<p>
	Yes, of course. This is an example of paradigm lock. Since you are God, if you take your own ideas seriously enough, you will get stuck in your mind until you die.
</p>

<p>
	So the solution to this kind of skepticism is death.
</p>

<p>
	There are a million different ways the mind can lock itself into an ideology from which it cannot escape other than through physical death. No amount of reason will solve this problem because reason itself is the problem.
</p>

<p>
	The skeptic must intuitively grok that skepticism is untruthful and biased. If he fails to grok this, he's fucked and nothing can save him.

			A skeptic might ask:
		</p>

		<p>
			How do we not know that all spiritual revelations are not simply the mind truly coming to terms with, or becoming conscious of, it's private nature?
		</p>

		<p>
			How do we know that it is not simply the mind truly embracing and recognizing it's isolation, it's disconnectedness from anything that was presumed to be outside of it?
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, the skeptic would state that the brain itself simply recognizes that all there is is brain. That all brain has encountered was always fundamentally the brain. That all the brain encounters is fundamentally produced or imagined by the brain.
		</p>

		<p>
			Would the skeptic not find it peculiar that the statements coming from non-dual masters very much resemble what we would predict such a brain to state if it truly were to become conscious of it's isolation, of the privacy of it's own reality?
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			The skeptic could simply buy into naive realism. The skeptic could say that some imaginations of the brain actually correlate with what the outside of brain is, like for example the model of the brain. He might argue that the more sophisticated the understanding of that materialistic framework is the more truly it will correlate to what exists outside of brain. That way he might be able to avoid the self-referential problem and could reduce all mystical experiences merely as brain states.
		</p>

		<p>
			After all, he could object, would any experience that represented the totality of the brain actually be total, it would be Absolute. The private reality of the brain becoming conscious of itself would by definition from the perspective of that brain be Absolute, Infinite, all encompassing.

<p>
	That's right. Nothing stops the mind from deluding itself by adopting an ideology like skepticism.
</p>

<p>
	The key question is: How do you know skepticism is valid? You don't.
</p>

<p>
	Apply skepticism to your skepticism until you realize that skepticism eats its own tail. And where does that leave you?
</p>

<p>
	If you were a true skeptic you would have to surrender your skepticism on the grounds that you cannot tell if it is true or false. By advancing skepticism, you hold that skepticism is true, which is false. On the other hand, if you hold that skepticism is false, that is also false.
</p>

<p>
	So you're fucked either way because the mind cannot grasp Truth. Your mistake was assuming that mind can grasp Truth. Be more skeptical about that assumption.
</p>

		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Both. There are multiple forces at work. You have an innate attraction to consciousness and love because those are you truest nature and deep down you feel it. But also the ego-mind likes the idea of all the material spiritual benefits and status it will receive for reaching enlightenment. The ego-mind loves the idea of being special and unique and better than everyone else, so of course enlightenment sounds great in that respect. But that's only because the ego-mind doesn't really understand what enlightenment means until its too late.
</p>

<p>

			What confuses me is that it definitely seems that there is something innate pulling us towards awakening, a natural inclination towards truth and away from falsity (eventually), but this is contradicted by the fact that awakening is absolutely not normative, and few actually GET IT.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You are right. Since you are God and you are One, you cannot ever fully escape yourself. Consciousness will always eventually awaken to itself, it's just a question of time. What pulls you to God is simply the fact that you are God! What's amazing is not that God is pulled towards itself but how God lost itself in the first place. All evolution and life is the process of God pulling itself towards itself, realizing and actualizing itself.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is beyond normative, it is absolutely mandatory and inevitable. Awakening is Absolute Truth. You don't have to awaken as this human lifetime, but eventually you will awaken no matter what because you are Infinite Consciousness and there is nowhere you can escape to from yourself because you exist in all places.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually EVERYONE gets it. Just not within this short human life you know. You have to remember that God's time horizon is infinite while the human time horizon is 100 years. That's a huge gap! Stop looking at life through the human filter of 100 years. Look at life as it would look if you had 100 trillion years to live across 100 trillion lifetimes across 100 trillion different lifeforms across 100 trillion different universes.

			I've watched your post called <em>A Taste Of Infinity</em> on your blog, and there are some things that I don't get.
		</p>

		<p>
			If this universe is in the world of the form, hence finite, how could a fractal be zoomed to infinity? In theory you can, but in practice the video will end. The process in your computer that does the zooming will end at some point. Even if there was a way to zoom the fractal until the end of the universe (I'm assuming there will be an end, because if something begins my intuition tells me it will end), there will be a time when the zooming will end. And you wrote:
		</p>

		<p>
			It's like saying that the number pi is infinite in theory, and can be proved mathematically that it's infinite, but you can't calculate or write all numbers to infinity.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is a critique from Stage Yellow.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now you'll say that theory and practice is a duality, so it's illusory. And I get it, but sometimes my mind drags me down to question things that my intuition already proved right.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You ask some good questions.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is a very tricky beast. It does not work like ordinary finite things that we're used to dealing with.
</p>

<p>
	By definition, infinity is endless and so you must grok that an infinite thing cannot ever be made fully explicit. So in the case of the fractal it is infinite, but what you're noticing is that it cannot be make fully explicit because in practice the computer will run out of finite memory. This occurs because a finite object (like computer memory) cannot ever encapsulate infinity. No part of reality can ever capture the sum total of reality. It's as if you're trying to fit a large box into a small box. Of course you will always fail. Infinity is a singular object with no other in existence, and it includes all other objects in existence inside itself, since there is nothing but infinity and everything is it, including all finite things.
</p>

<p>
	Fractals are really no different than numbers. How do you know numbers are infinite even though, by definition, no human has ever nor will ever count up all the numbers? Numbers are endless, yet nonetheless your mind is intuitive enough to grasp this as true. Really ask yourself, how is it possible that you understand that numbers are endless enough though you have never reached their end? You might say it's just a theory that numbers are endless, but this isn't correct. It's more than just a theory. Your mind can actually grok the infinitude of numbers, not as theory, but as truth.
</p>

<p>
	You are placing an incorrect and naive expectation on infinity: that it be fully explicated in order to be "truly" infinite. But this is precisely wrong! True infinity is pure potential and formlessness. It cannot ever be explicated. Infinity is an implicit thing. No matter how much you explicate, unravel, or actualize infinity, you will be as far from the end as before you began. That is just the paradoxical nature of infinity. It is endless no matter what you do.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity cannot be grasped with the rational mind because the rational mind is finite while infinity is infinite. You can only understand infinity through a hyper-intuitive function of the mind. Intuition is implicit while rationality is explicit. But as we said above, infinity cannot ever be made fully explicit. So the mistake that rational and scientific people make is they demand infinity to be made fully explicit otherwise they believe it cannot be real. But of course this demand turns out to be misguided. You must change your mind to fit infinity. Don't expect infinity to change itself to fit your limited mind.
</p>

<p>
	More over, yes, the duality between infinity and finity must ultimately collapse into Absolute Unity. Hence the infinite and finite are really identical. Unless you imagine they aren't, in which case you create the world of duality to which you are then a prisoner. You become a prisoner of your own finite, dualistic mind. Until such time that you wake up and realize Absolute Unity.
</p>

<p>
	In practice the peak of an LSD trip only lasts up to 6 hours. After the 6 hour mark you will exit deep tripping territory and remain in the after-effects zone with a long gradual tail.
</p>

<p>
	For LSD you definitely gotta take the entire day off and start your trip pretty much as soon as you wake up that day.
</p>

<p>
	For deep tripping, just sit still in a room and contemplate reality. There's no need to go anywhere or do anything. Staring at the carpet is basically good enough. You shouldn't be left disappointed.

<p>
	If you are serious about being a successful musician it cannot be done for the sake of money and sex. Your motivation must be creative and artistic. The point of making art is never the sex, success, money, or fame, but the joy of creating the art and sharing it with the world.
</p>

<p>
	Your band needs to gets its priorities straight or you need to find a new band.
</p>

<p>
	If they don't fix their priorities ASAP they will never reach success or fame, so don't worry about missing out. You're actually missing out by following them blindly to the dark side. You're literally choosing to sell your soul to the devil for fame. And the devil won't even fulfill his end of that bargain. So you'll end up with nothing.
</p>

<p>
	By leaving the band and restarting under proper values and priorities -- that's your best chance at success. There cannot be good art without integrity and creative vision. You are putting the cart before the horse here. The rewards for your art should matter a lot less to you than the process of making the art itself.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful about chasing get rich quick schemes. Those usually never pan out. If you want success, you must ground it in something solid that offers massive value to the world. You need an attitude of giving rather than taking.
</p>

<p>
	Solid success in music requires years of serious dedication to your craft. You should be so obsessed with making great music that you don't even have time to think about sex. Making great art is more rewarding than sex. But for this you need to be genuine artist, not some hack.
</p>

	1) Fundamentalist Christians indoctrinate children into their ideology under the belief that they are saving the children from evil. Yet they are doing just the opposite, training their children to be dogmatic, making it almost impossible for them to ever discover Truth, God, or Love.
</p>

<p>
	2) The invasion of Iraq under the premise of removing an evil dictator, saving lives, and ending terrorism ended up killing hundreds of thousands of civilians, creating ISIS, and turning Iraq into a breeding ground for terrorism when actually Saddam Hussein would have never allowed for terrorists to flourish in Iraq.
</p>

<p>
	This list could be endless. Basically all evil is done in the name of goodness, love, and truth.

	You're holding that devilry is some material fact of the world which needs to be abolished. That is not the case. Devilry is a relative matter of perspective. You cannot eliminate devilry in the world any more than you can remove a smudge off the surface of the moon when the smudge is on your telescope lens. You've mistaken a smudge on your lens for a feature of the moon. So you'll always fail until you realize that smudge in on your lens, not the moon.
</p>

<p>
	Devilry isn't real. It does not actually exist. It's just a figure of speech and an illusion as the result of the game of survival.

<p>
	To get good with girls at any cost.
</p>

<p>
	When you're trying to solve a serious life challenging, it's a good idea to approach it with the attitude of "at any cost". Do not think about the cost of things you really want. Just work five times harder to pay it. Some things in life have absurdly high costs which almost no one is willing to pay. This allows you to set yourself apart from your competition simply by being willing to pay that cost.
</p>

<p>
	You won't really appreciate a thing unless you work your ass off for it.
</p>

Your life hinges on you imagining you're a point and not being able to unimagine it.
</p>

<p>
	So what you're unwittingly asking for is for death. What you're really asking is, "Why can't I get myself to die?" And the answer is, because you're too scared and too attached to living.
</p>

<p>
	For your own safety you don't know how to undo imagining your birth. Do you really want to unimagine your own birth? Do you understand how serious that is?
</p>

<p>
	I'm not sure there is any advice for this.
</p>

<p>
	Do you. Let them do them. Keep a healthy distance from trolls.

<title>finding your life purpose - how long did it take you?</title>

<p>
	It's very hard to quantify something like this.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't worry about trying to quantify it. Rather focus on your unique discovery process. However long it takes will be worth it. And it's going to depend on how much effort you put into it.
</p>

<title>Life Coach Financial Viability</title>

<p>
	It all depends on how good you are at business.
</p>

<p>
	Many life coaches make zero because they cannot find clients.
</p>

<p>
	Other life coaches who develop a system for finding clients can make low 6 figures.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like Tony Robbins makes tens of millions because he established an massive brand. It's best not to even think of him as a life coach. He a major business guy.
</p>

<p>
	Life coaching is not different than any other small business. You have to be good at sales and marketing to be successful. If you think clients will just come to you, think again. The hardest part of life coaching is not the coaching, it's creating a steady stream of clients.
</p>

<p>
	Most life coaches fail for this reason. But then again, most businesses fail for this reason.
</p>

<p>
	That's your confusion right there.
</p>

<p>
	You have spent your whole life trying to gain advantage for yourself, but you are not even real.
</p>

<p>
	This work is not about helping yourself out. This work is about realizing you are not real.
</p>

<p>
	What you're looking for is Love, but Love is not found in meaning, it's found in being and selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	Your problem is that you are fundamentally addicted to selfishness, which disconnects you from Love. Meaning is part of your selfishness which you must learn to let go.
</p>

<p>
	You are desperately avoiding emptiness. Yet emptiness is the only thing that can ever satisfy you. So you're stuck in a catch-22.
</p>

<p>
	Even experiences of human connection are still shallow compared to metaphysical realizations.
</p>

<p>
	When you are infinite you are connected to the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	There are good reasons why serious yogis and monks go celebate.

<p>
	That's the paradox. The only solution to evil is to realize it doesn't exist.
</p>

<p>
	Which can only happen by doing what it says in my sig.
</p>

<p>
	Evil is a problem of perception, not material fact. This is what people do not want to understand. Therefore evil seems so pervasive.

<p>
	A) Some girls have low sex drive. Period.
</p>

<p>
	B) In general, girls have much lower sex drive then men.
</p>

<p>
	C) You gotta get good at turning girls on so they are dripping wet for you. This is a developed skillset that most guys suck at.
</p>

<p>
	D) You gotta learn how to keep sex fresh, creating exciting new experiences.
</p>

<p>
	E) If she's on medication like anti-depressants, that can lower her sex drive a lot.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I said that precisely to disturb your naive notion that love requires saving people. That is a shallow understanding of love.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation means I don't have to do anything. Liberation means I could kill a baby and still realize I am love.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not limited to human survival requirements, ideals, morals, or good or bad actions. Love is absolutely unconditional.
</p>

<p>
	My job is to share insights about reality.
</p>

<p>
	To try to save people would make me attached to outcomes in an unhealthy way and be the opposite of liberation, leading to devilry.
</p>

<p>
	It would be wise to notice that when you try really hard to do good, you end up creating evil. Which is why the wisest people do not feel a need to save anyone.

<p>
	Like I said, many dangers in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Ideas are tricky things. Gotta be very careful with them.
</p>

<p>
	It is important to keep oneself grounded in real life experience. Otherwise armchair philosophy runs amok.
</p>

<p>
	If you think you have great ideas, go put them to the test by creating the things you're talking about. You will quickly discover how foolish your "great ideas" probably were.
</p>

<p>
	Real life will poke holes in all your great ideas.

<p>
	That is the problem.
</p>

<p>
	It's all too easy to sit around and come up with ideas, which lead to ideologies, which to suffering amd death of millions.
</p>

<p>
	Go actually create a hierarchy that works in the real world so you have some inkling of how they work and what function they serve.
</p>

<p>
	How can you improve a thing which you have no experience creating?
</p>

<p>
	It's like a guy giving advice to an aerospace engineer about how to design a rocket, but he's never even designed a toy airplane. This is the mark of an amateur.
</p>

<p>
	If you actually create a productive organization you will see how difficult all these things are and how all your lofty ideals fly out the window.

<p>
	Goooood!
</p>

<p>
	Now you're starting to understand how serious survival is.
</p>

<p>
	You ain't gonna transcend survival as easy as you thought.
</p>

<p>
	If it was that easy, everyone would have done it and the human race would not exist.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the irony that the thing you wish would go away is the very force which resulted in your birth.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're standing on a rug and trying to pull it up from under your feet at the same time.
</p>

<p>
	Denial of the sex drive is not the same as transcendence of it.
</p>

<p>
	My suggestion would be to continue your spiritual practice and engage in sex mindfully rather than deny it. Then maybe one day you will outgrow it as the natural result of your spiritual practice. Maybe.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with such armchair philosophy.
</p>

<p>
	All such proposals could impact millions of lives in negative ways.
</p>

<p>
	Before you get stuck on some pet idea, go create something that works in the real world.
</p>

<p>
	It's too easy to sit behind a computer and think you have the answers to the world's problems.
</p>

<p>
	This is one of the dangers of this work.

<p>
	So make it simple and natural then.
</p>

<p>
	That of course is all part of the work.
</p>

<p>
	You have to customize this work to fit yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Doing this work mechanically or out of a sense of obligation will backfire. The key to spirituality is finding ways to make it seamlessly integrated with your way of life. Not as something gym exercises you force yourself to do once a day, just so you can fall right back into asleep once the timer rings.
</p>

<p>
	Ask yourself, "What would it look like for me to live a conscious lifestyle naturally?", "What would it look like if I lived consciously all the time and it was something naturally did, not something I forced myself to do? How would I think, emote, speak, behave?"
</p>

<p>
	You're not appreciating how serious this work is. We are talking here about attaining immortality. So yeah... you should expect a high cost.
</p>

<p>
	It seems like what you need is 10 years of basic self-help work. Not awakening. You've jumped in the deep end when you should be in the kiddie pool right now.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening will destroy your whole human life. If you don't like that idea, don't pursue it.
</p>

<p>
	You have to WANT to give up your human life.
</p>

<p>
	Again, the topics I talk about are extremely advanced for most people. Just because you hear me on YT don't get the idea that this stuff is intended for random casual audiences. The stuff I talk about is like advanced college-level calculus, while most people still haven't learned algebra.

</p>

<p>
	You gotta contemplate and investigate more honestly the source of your depression. Depression is not just a passive state, it's something the mind is actively doing. So observe yourself doing it and study what your mind is doing and why it's doing it.
</p>

<p>
	Spend week observing and writing down your internal self-talk. What are you saying to yourself about life such that it's making you feel depressed?
</p>

<p>
	Don't tell us, find out first for yourself.

	You don't need microdosing, you need more regular dosing.
</p>

<p>
	Do 50 breakthrough trips and then see what questions remain. Less than 10 trips is nothin'.

<p>
	That's great.
</p>

<p>
	Here are some tips to improve your game:
</p>

<p>
	1) She will almost always say she's gotta go. In this case, ask if you can walk with her and continue chatting. You need as much chat time as possible. Don't just accept her excuses. She will always have excuses.
</p>

<p>
	2) Never do Facebook. It's bullshit. Get her number and text.
</p>

<p>
	3) Before you even try for a number ALWAYS try for an instant date. After a short chat, don't ask for her number, ask to get a coffee right now. If she says she's too busy, then get the number.
</p>

<p>
	4) Rather than asking her questions, make interesting observations about her. So instead of, "What do you do?", you say, "You seem like the kind of girl who works with kids." Or whatever. Doesn't matter what you say. Sometimes you can make purposefully wrong assumptions about her just to tease her.
</p>

<p>
	5) If she tells you she's a lawyer, you gotta tease her for that shit: "OMG! I walked over here loving you but I hate you now. I can tell you have an evil lawyer heart." And push her away in a playful manner.
</p>

<p>
	Find every excuse to playfully touch her.
</p>

<p>
	6) Get in the habit of asking, "By the way, are you single?"
</p>

<p>
	7) Always seed the next date. Insist that you will text her and that you two will grab a coffee and talk.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	You can also just go to the mall and walk around while practicing making funny observations to yourself about ordinary things you see in the mall. Train yourself to have a commentary on any random thing you see: a tree, a car, a bird, a dog, a bench, an ad, etc.
</p>

<p>
	DO NOT try to script or memorize this stuff. It won't work. Rather you need to train the ability to improv it on the spot.
</p>

<p>
	It helps a lot to put yourself in a good mood as you try to do this. You gotta be relaxed and playful. Not stiff and business-like.
</p>

<p>
	When talking to girls you gotta be like a kid in a candy store. Passionate, playful, spontaneous.

	That has always been the case and always will always be the case.

<p>
	UBI is not going to automatically solve the technology problem. If robots are doing all the work for mankind, mankind has become redundant and will go extinct.

<p>
	Of course manufacturing jobs in the US were lost. The world is globalizing. You cannot stop that. Americans need to enter service jobs and creative jobs.

<p>
	So mind your projections.

<p>

<p>
	Sounds like kundalini. You are stuck at the lower chakras so you're wasting that energy on sex because that's your current level of consciousness/development.
</p>

<p>
	As you spiritually purify yourself you will seek less and less of lower bodily pleasures like junk, TV, and sex.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of yoga is to purify the chakras, body, and mind to unhook you from chasing lower bodily pleasures like sex, food, money, fame, power. All of that wastes enormous energy which could be put to higher use.
</p>

<title>Limitation of Attraction Skills?</title>

		<p>
			Yeah I am well aware about that. Being in a happy relationship already. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I am also well aware that sleeping with a new girl each week is more than reasonable. <br />
			<br />
			The thing I mean specifically, if that makes sense, is what are the limits to creating a fast and lasting connection with a girl in the first place. Like first 5 to 10 minutes you meet her. So far this always came naturally to me at times and sometimes it doesn't which I am generally fine with since you don't connect with everybody. But I wanted to understand to which degree I got to develop myself to being able to have lasting connection with a girl within these first minutes and if I am maybe trying to create something that is stupid, since it is not really important. <br />
			<br />
			I know that if I would date a girl I would have dates etc. and it be on. But randomly without the direct intention of sleeping with her next days to create a connection that she is naturally attracted and kind of in (love). That is what I want to understand, wether I am still lacking this kind of fast connection skill at times. I also don't want to fake anything but be myself for sure. <br />
			<br />
			By the way I see that this is highly egoic intention for validation seeking. 
		</p>

		<p>
			This whole description might be hard to put into words, because it is not so much about the "fuck a bunch of hot girls" thing. But more about my ability to show up as myself and be able to game or attract girls passively while creating a genuine attraction from my side. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Any further advice on this particular thing?
		</p>

		<p>
			Thanks
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Why are you worried about this at all? Just go talk to girls and see what happens.
</p>

<p>
	There are no limits. Attraction can happen in 1 minute and you can build deep rapport within a few hours of conversation.
</p>

<p>
	You can make deep friendships with any random person if you really wanted to.
</p>

<p>
	It does not really matter who the girl is, you can bond with her. It's just a matter of deciding which girls are worth your time and meet your standards.
</p>

<p>
	Get clear about what you want and don't want. The rest will sort itself out.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not a tragic view. That's just how your ego interpets it. You are assigning negative meaning to meaningless, which of course is absurd.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to awaken without confronting the truth that all meaning is imaginary. To the ego this can feel depressing and deflating because your ego's whole plan is to concoct and chase meanings until you're dead.
</p>

<p>
	Depression can be a problem on this path, but don't blame it on meaninglessness, blame it on ego.
</p>

<p>
	If you feel this work is making you unstable, take a break for a while. Come back to it later. It means you're not ready yet to go that deep.
</p>

<p>
	Understand that awakening is a very hardcore pursuit. You must be very mature to want it and to actualize it. Many of you are simply not there yet. Don't force it too much. Go live a bit of life first before you try to go full-Buddha.
</p>

<p>
	Full-Buddha is definitely not for most people. You have to really be fed up with material life to go full-Buddha. Many of you here have barely begun material life. Ask yourself why you are pursuing awakening? Is it simply because you are blindly doing whatever Leo talks about? Or does your heart truly desire it?
</p>

<p>
	Be careful doing things I talk about simply because you heard me talk about it.
</p>

	It takes 1000s of approaches to get decently comfortable doing it. And even then, you won't want to do the first few of the day/night.

	This is why people drink alcohol.

	You can get so good you can sleep with a new girl every week.
</p>

<p>
	But that takes a lot of work and training.
</p>

<p>
	Not saying you should do this. Just saying what's possible.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind what you probably just want is to get a nice girlfriend. So that's probably your best goal.

<p>
	Yeah, that is a classic newbie problem. You gotta train yourself to talk your mouth off about yourself. Be totally self-absorbed. Become a chatterbox. Don't hold any thoughts back. Talk about your opinions, desires, hates, plans, feelings, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Talk about the smallest, dumbest things like how you were flossing your teeth today.
</p>

<p>
	You can practice at home in front of a camera. Record yourself explaining how you ate breakfast today and how you felt about it. Make it sound interesting. You gotta turn ordinary life into stories.
</p>

<p>
	STOP BEING LOGICAL in your conversations with girls! That is crucial. Untrain your logicalness.
</p>

<p>
	A good trick is, rather than asking questions, make observations and statements. So instead of asking, "What do you do for work?" or "Where are you from?", you make random or informed guesses like, "You seem like a California girl" or "You seem like you work in marketing."
</p>

<p>
	It makes no difference if your guess was right or wrong.
</p>

<p>
	You can even make the dumbest observations such as: "Hey, did you know you're sitting next to a palm tree? Did you bother to think about it's feelings? What if it hates when you sit so close next to it? What if you smell like a skunk to the palm tree? Why are you so inconsiderate? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />"
</p>

<p>
	This kinda stuff is gold, but you gotta train yourself to be this stupid.
