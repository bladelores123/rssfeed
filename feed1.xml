	Go out and practice socializing with strangers at malls, stores, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Practice on old ladies at the mall.
</p>

<p>
	There is no magic pill solution that will allow you to escape practice.

<p>
	Your practice shouldn't be focused on how to get anyone attracted, but just simple basic small talk. Learn to keep a conversation going with a stranger while holding good eye contact and being comfortable in your body.

	Keep it very basic.

<p>
	You and him are both fooling yourselves here. Especially you, but probably him too.
</p>

<p>
	If he sleeps around with other women he will never marry you and your relationship will end very soon.
</p>

<p>
	The subtext of his decision that you are not properly reading is this: "I'm not happy with you. You're not the one for me. I want to go find other girls who are better for me."
</p>

<p>
	That's really what he told you. He just sugarcoated it so that it doesn't break your heart and so that it appears justified in his mind. Don't forget, he must fool himself here too because otherwise he couldn't get away with such selfishness in his own mind.
</p>

<p>
	Dating is a game, and both parties are trying to get the best they can get. He's looking for an upgrade but has to do it in way that won't make him feel like a total asshole.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sorry to have to tell you this. It's some brutal truth.
</p>

<p>
	Do not fool yourself with fantasies of trying to tame him, change him, or capture him for yourself. That will not work. Clearly he's not ready to commit to you. That doesn't fit your values, so you should seek a new man.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason to continue to be with him is if you are both clear that this is just a temporary thing for sex or whatever. But don't fool yourselves into thinking this is going to go somewhere serious.
</p>

<p>
	Again, be ware of the trap of trying to tame him. You can waste a lot of that doing that. The bitter pill here that you need to swallow is that he just don't like you enough to sustain a relationship. Try not to take it personally.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Please don't literally shit your pants.
</p>

<p>
	Calling that "defunding the police" is such bad framing though.
</p>

<p>
	That framing will hurt the liberal agenda, scaring people away from embracing stage Green.
</p>

<p>
	We have to be very careful with slogans like "socialist", "defunding the police", "open boarders", etc. This freaks normies out.

			Could you unconditionally love the aspect of Leo that is his awareness? Whenever his presence shines through the layers of crud that mostly make up a person, and you get a glimpse of that, can you love that unconditionally? If it is the same in every being, then can you love the presence and not the person? That is what mooji speaks of when talking of love.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You could love any part of reality.
</p>

<p>
	But if you're picking between good and bad parts, that's conditional love.
</p>

<p>
	Unconditional love doesn't pick good parts.
</p>

<p>
	There is a Love that's higher than what Mooji talks about.
</p>

<p>
	It is wrong to say that Leo's "awareness" is pure and good while his crud is bad and evil. The truth is that the good and the crud are identical. What's necessary here is to become conscious of that identity, not to cherrypick parts.
</p>

<p>
	Love is simply the inability to see "bad".

<p>
	You forget the second part of that sentence: "no human will ever be as loving as God <u><strong>until it literally becomes God</strong></u>, at which point it is no long a human being"
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to reach unconditional Love. But there is a price to pay, which is surrendering all form. You call this death.
</p>

<p>
	You are only able to love as deeply as your attachments allow.
</p>

<p>
	The logic of love is simple: zero attachment = infinite love, infinite attachment = zero love.
</p>

<p>
	You find yourself somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.

<p>
	Get used to it. There's gonna be very hairy moments if you trip long enough.
</p>

<p>
	It happens because you are fundamentally afraid to become conscious of everything that is. Certain insights become so deep that your mind isn't able to handle them, so it reacts with fear.
</p>

<p>
	One bad trip doesn't necessarily mean anything. It's just a blip on the radar screen in the grand scheme of things. Sounds like you haven't even experienced a proper bad trip yet.
</p>

<p>
	Some trips are like nightmares that leave you horrified.

<p>
	When a mass shooting is happening, the "love" that must be used in that case is to shoot the shooter in the head.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to limit your notion "love" here. Love must be proportional to the situation. If you have a brutal situation, it will require brutal action to suppress.
</p>

<p>
	One of the common delusions of stage Green is thinking that they can fix stage Red criminals with some hippie love intervention -- which of course the stage Red criminal will just exploit.
</p>

<p>
	You can fight mild crime with "love", but serious crime also requires force.
</p>

<p>
	Force is often used precisely because all other options have failed to work and patience has run thin.

<title>Yellow approach to police defunding</title>

<p>
	You'd have to actually test it in the field in various cities to see how viable this is.
</p>

<p>
	It may be viable in some places but not in others.
</p>

<p>
	Social workers can replace police to some extent in the most developed parts of the country.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, America has lots of mass shootings, so you're still gonna need police with heavy gear to some degree. The question is, to what degree?
</p>

<p>
	This is one of those highly complex issues that cannot be resolved ideologically but only scientifically by doing it and carefully tracking the results.
</p>

<p>
	If guns weren't so widespread in America then the police force wouldn't have to be so heavily armed.

	You're gonna screw yourself up if you only listen to my perspectives on reality.
</p>

<p>
	When my finger points to the moon, look at the moon, not my finger. Right now you are still looking at my finger.
</p>

<p>
	Do not take any one human's ideas too seriously. Of course this applies to myself. This is a more general problem of the mind. The mind is a dangerous thing. You shouldn't ever take ideas too seriously. Ideas are not real life. As soon as you take ideas too seriously all sorts of evil results.

</p>

<p>
	You are right in your conclusion that it is impossible for your finite mind to love a thing unconditionally, but the real reason for this is because a finite mind must have conditions otherwise it will cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	Only an infinite mind which has zero attachments is capable of unconditional love. And another word for an infinite mind with zero attachments or conditions is God. Hence God is Love, and no human will ever be as loving as God until it literally becomes God, at which point it is no long a human being.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, if your mind became infinite you would realize that Leo's shape is irrelevant because all form is fundamentally just a fluctuation of your own consciousness, so the issue isn't about how to love Leo when his form is totally changing but how to love YOURSELF when your form is constantly changing. Since God has no form, it is able to identify with all form and therefore love all form unconditionally no matter how much it changes. From God's POV there is literally no difference between Leo looking like a human vs Leo looking like an alien. God's love is not applied at the level of individuals or objects, it's the entire field of consciousness itself, which is ONE.
</p>

<p>
	You could say that the recognition that all individuals and objects are ONE field, is Love itself.
</p>

<p>
	You  = Me = God = Love
</p>

	If you're taking LSD you should definitely use a test kit on it to screen out nasty substitutes which can be common. Since LSD is so popular it may often not be real LSD.
</p>

<p>
	This is less of an issue with research chemicals and powders.

	He's more of a political/social philosopher/humanist/scholar.
</p>

<p>
	Don't compare him to Western analytic philosophers.
</p>

<p>
	At least he understands the importance of Love.
</p>

<p>
	Any philosopher who doesn't understand Love has failed.

	If you take the entire population, it will be more Blue than Orange because there are millions of poor rural elderly Chinese. In big cities among younger folk it will be more Orange than Blue.

<p>
	Ralston is wrong of course.
</p>

<p>
	Will and material reality/experience are identical.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is Will.
</p>

<p>
	Since Consciousness is omniscient, omnipresent, intelligent, and sentient, it is capable of creating/imagining whatever it Wills. And since Consciousness is Love, its Will is Love.

<p>
	Most of North Korea survives by underground private markets. Most food and basic goods are procured that way.
</p>

<p>
	The North Korean government is fully aware of these illegal markets but will not shut them down or else everyone starves. All the high ranking elites and gov officials use these markets themselves.
</p>

<p>
	It's an open secret.

<p>
	And this is the key: your Love must be so strong and meta that you fully embrace everyone's unwillingness to unite and desire to slit each other's throats out of selfishness and fear.
</p>

<p>
	Once you grasp that, you're seeing it properly, from the eyes of God.

<p>
	If Love cannot love hate, then it isn't Love.

<p>
	Direct consciousness is NOT knowledge, belief, concept, or interpretation.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that you are conscious of existence. Existence itself is NOT knowledge, belief, concept, or interpretation. HERE IT IS!
</p>

<p>
	EXISTENCE!
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking about it and LOOK at it. You are unwittingly giving thought priority over direct experience. Stop doing that, silly.

</p>

<p>
	Drop your logic. You will not awaken that way. Everything you're doing here is still all at the level of concept, which is a million miles away from the real deal.

You just need to work on finding a job and moving out from your parents.
</p>

<p>
	You're still like a bird in the nest. Leave the nest and fly.
</p>

<p>
	Once you move out you will feel a lot of freedom and a sense of autonomy.
</p>

<p>
	How you move out is up to you. I would look for a job that can pay you some money and gain you some of the experience you'll need in the future. Or a job that gives you free time to work on your own stuff. Some jobs are less demanding than others. You'll have to get creative and see what opportunities are around.
</p>

<p>
	Once you have a job to pay basic bills you can work at night on developing new skills and upgrading your career.
</p>

<p>
	Work 40 hrs at your job and then another 20 hours at night on your skills.
</p>

<p>
	Firstly, I wasn't paying for it, so that helped things a great deal.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, I really loved philosophy and was thinking of becoming a professor.
</p>

<p>
	Thirdly, I was a really good student, so it fit me.
</p>

<p>
	Fourthly, I was also planning and training myself to be a game designer, so I wasn't really bought into the illusion that having a college degree would get me where I wanted to be.
</p>

<p>
	Fifthly, I was clueless about how the real world worked and the possibility of starting my own business.

<p>
	You don't get the depth of the problem.
</p>

<p>
	God is not trying to hide itself from you, as if playing some sick game.
</p>

<p>
	God wants nothing more than to reveal itself to you as quickly and directly as possible. But you are too AFRAID to look at God.
</p>

<p>
	FEAR is the only obstacle. So God must patiently wait for you to muster the courage to look at yourself.
</p>

<p>
	God gave mankind psychedelics, and mankind spat in God's face by rejecting them and demonizing them out of FEAR.
</p>

<p>
	So God went: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
</p>

<p>
	The entire human race could have awoken long ago had psychedelics not been outlawed and demonized for thousands of years by egos out of greed, selfishness, fear, power, and sex.
</p>

<p>
	Mankind is doing all this to itself. Out of fear and selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	God can only give mankind a gift it is willing to receive.
</p>

<p>
	It isn't uncommon, when fighting monsters, to become oneself a monster.
</p>

<p>
	It's a similar dynamic to how atheists get so passionate about denouncing the idiocy of religious fundamentalists that themselves become fundamentalist about atheism and materialism.
</p>

<p>
	You can't just do the opposite of those you hate, you must go meta to truly resolve it.
</p>

<p>
	Are there some violent stage Green people who fall into this trap? Of course! But they are not respresentative of Green. Just as Nazis are not representative of Blue.

<p>
	I think college is mostly a waste of money and time. There are much better uses of time. College is good if you want to be an academic, scholar, doctor, laywer, or STEM field. Otherwise, it's not very useful.

	But you can certainly learn lessons from him and learn to be more charismatic.

<p>
	Defunding police will only make the problem worse as cops will be more stretched thin, ready to snap, and eager to arrest people for money.
</p>

<p>
	This is where mob outrage becomes a problem. People are pissed off at police but that doesn't translate to wise policy.
</p>

<p>
	If anything police need more money for better training, less stressful workloads, and to hire better people.

	6 more years to finish university??? Dude, raise your standards.
</p>

<p>
	If it takes you 10 years to finish university then it probably ain't for you.
</p>

<p>
	Find something you're truly passionate about. You are still young. Don't squander the next 6 years. Your next 6 years can make or break your life.

<p>
	Do you understand that in a country with 330 million people and millions of arrests made every year, that some of those arrests will go horribly, horribly wrong?
</p>

<p>
	Even if 99.99% of police are angels, that still means hundreds of horrible arrests per year. And when everyone is walking around with cameras these days, we're going to see more and more of the horror on YT.
</p>

<p>
	Consider how many people die per year from doctors making mistakes.

	As the late Kilindi Iyi explained, in African tribes they use different psychedelics to enhance their performance while hunting, hiking, etc.
</p>

<p>
	If you're going to hunt a lion with a spear, you better drink some psychedelic.

<p>
	It's hard to say. There are no rigorous definitions for any of these terms. People use them willy-nilly to refer to many different states and conditions of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I would just point out that there are thousands of different awakened states of consciousness and consciousness has infinite degrees of wokeness. So it's a very vast territory to explore. Stop thinking of awakening in a linear, binary, or one-dimensional way.

<p>
	No. Consciousness untangles all things. And a psychedelic is consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it is utterly baffling and astounding. That part is correct.
</p>

<p>
	But don't forget, you are AWLAYS tripping. Your "brain" is always full of chemicals. So materialism is a specific kind of trip. There is so such thing as perception without a chemical medium in biological organisms.

<p>
	45 mins of shamanic breathing is very trippy and powerful, but it is nowhere near as powerful as a DMT breakthrough. Not even in the same ballpark.
</p>

<p>
	A DMT breakthrough is beyond anything the human mind can imagine is possible. It is literally the impossible made possible.

	I would focus your research efforts more on reducing/eliminating the pain and discomfort rather than some fantasy of regrowing lost body parts.

<p>
	Your real issue here is finding a solution to pain and discomfort, which is within reason.

<p>
	The paradox is that although materialism is false, material conditions still play a crucial role in determining your experience of reality because physics and chemistry is a very deep layer of the dream.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are powerful for the same reason that the floor you are standing on is powerful enough to keep you from falling through the Earth.

<p>
	This is false. Your brain doesn't exist and it is not translating anything.
</p>

<p>
	The color of the apple is real.
</p>

<p>
	All raw sensations are Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Color is not an interpretation. Your mind is projecting a conceptual scheme on top of raw sensation.

	This is possible.

<p>
	I would keep patiently researching this issue and exploring solutions. Don't give up hope. There likely exists a solution, you just gotta find it.
</p>

<p>
	Read books, talk to experts, research online, experiment with different things, etc. Turn it into a quest of discovery.

			I cannot agree more. Hehe. Excting times ahead.<br />
			<br />
			My life purpose is to help mainstream society explore the full power of psychedelics. We're talking both for just plain therapy-purposes and of course also for spiritual purposes.<br />
			<br />
			That's my LP. Leo, do you have any tips on how I can help make this life purpose become a reality? <br />
			<br />
			Right now, my plan is to study psychology at Copenhagen University (please everyone reading this, wish for me that I get in:D haha) and then use my psychology degree to study psychedelic therapy and at some point open centers in Denmark and the globe and spread that good shit.<br />
			<br />
			Sounds like an ok plan to you Leo? ANything you think I should know? You are after all probably the dude on this planet with the most psychedelic experience (in spiritual realms at least), so I'm honored to even be able to ask you this question.

<p>
	Sounds like an interesting plan.
</p>

<p>
	Just be mindful of the legal issues. Not sure what they are in your part of the world.

You got a lot to integrate there so don't trip again for a while. Sounds like you went right up to the edge of what your mind/ego were able to handle. If you integrate all that, next time you will be able to handle even deeper insights.
</p>

<p>
	But be careful with future dosages. You might want to lower them so you don't get ahead of your skiis.

<p>
	Of course you can read books and all that too.

<p>
	The most important first step is to set the desire/intention to have great skillful sex. If your intention is set, the rest will follow.

	The full power of psychedelics is virtually unknown to anyone. We are still in the Psychedelic Dark Age.

			Can you make the video about giving multiple orgasms, please? I have stable 1-2 per sex session and few times I managed to make it to 3-5 (often using the hand, though) and I seem to platoue there. My woman, though, doesn't believe that she can consistently orgasm more than 2 times and she says 10+ orgasms is some fairytale. Maybe that belief of her is the problem, she says she consciously tries to withhold orgasm for some time to make it more intense

<p>
	I already have videos about how to have great sex for men and women.
</p>

<p>
	Your woman needs to be guided by you. You need to take her and show her and train her.
</p>

<p>
	Be proactive about it. Great sex is not going to make itself.

<p>
	Of course if you press them on it they will be forced to admit it, but most of them keep it unsaid.
</p>

<p>
	Most of them don't even make the connection in their own mind that they started on the path because the culture changed to allow it because psychedelics became widely used.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason stuff like yoga and Zen and Buddhism and TM became popular in the West is because minds were opened thanks to psychedelics in the 60's. Psychedelics made the myths tangible. All of this gets taken for granted and unacknowledged.
</p>

<p>
	You think it's an accident, for example, that Ralston and Shinzen Young both lived in San Fransisco during the 60's??? They didn't do it on their own. Their culture led them to it.
</p>

<p>
	Hehe, it's easy. You just need to find the right man who knows what he's doing.
</p>

<p>
	3-5 times is the least I expect from a good session.
</p>

<p>
	But the most important thing is not the number, it's the depth and length. Imagine a full-body orgasm that lasts for a continuous 2 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	As with awakening, there are many orders of magnitude of orgasm.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, orgasm and awakening should become indistinguishable, since both are just the realization of LOVE.
</p>

<p>
	Death feels like an endless Cosmic orgasm. And after that your sexual orgasmd become Godly and Cosmic. You are not cumming for one person any more, you are cumming for the whole Universe! You are God cumming inside God at the realization of your own Infinite Beauty <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	An interesting fact that many of today's Western guru's don't tell you about is that the only reason they got involved in pursing awakening is thanks the 60's psychedelic experiences and culture.
</p>

<p>
	Without psychedelics half of today's 60 to 70 year old gurus wouldn't be enlightened. But of course they will deny this.

<title>do you orgasm at the same time as your partner?</title>

<p>
	It's actually very easy to do. You can just communicate and coordinate it.
</p>

<p>
	Try this: tell her that she is not allowed to orgasm until she gets your permission. Train her to cum only when you tell her to. Do not be letting her cum on her own whenever she wants. This is a rookie mistake. She has to follow your lead, and your lead should delay her orgasms to tease her until she is ready to explode. This will make her orgasms way more powerful and deeper. You can also use this to extend the length of her orgasms from seconds to minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Stop having lazy, unskillful, accidental sex.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but also One can communicate with itself. You can communicate consciously with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	See, if I have a profound conversation with Donald Duck, I will know I'm talking to myself but that doesn't invalidate the conversation, it only deepens it. I can appreciate that the Donald Duck part of me has something valuable to say. I can thank Donald Duck and even make love to him. Because I'm not afraid of imaginary things, because imagination is the only game in town and it's not a bad thing, it's the greatest superpower.
</p>

<p>
	Don't poo-poo your imagination. It is your most powerful tool. Just be conscious of what you're imagining and why. Imagination only becomes a problem when you aren't aware that you are doing it.
</p>

			That's the thing. I don't feel like I'm just believing the things anyone is telling me. It's an understanding coming from somewhere else. This understanding is guiding me to question everything I am, and everything that I think, even thinking itself, and the notion of Truth. I don't know how to surrender that. That's why I'm here asking these questions. Looking for answers that will help me guide my focus towards what I already "know" is there.

<p>
	You have a very faint intuition that what we talk about here is true. That is necessary and important, but don't confuse that with the Consciousness of it itself.
</p>

<p>
	This is the #1 reason why I keep saying to take psychedelics. They will cut right through the conceptual bullshit that gurus have spent years filling your head with. The psychedelic will show in 30 minutes what would otherwise take you 10 years to understand while lost in all your beliefs about awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Let the psychedelic show you what no words can. You lack the necessary reference experiences, and the only solution to that is to gain those experiences.

<p>
	Psychedelics are taboo. Hardly any serious person does them because it's demonized by our culture.
</p>

<p>
	What we're doing here is changing culture. Which obviously gets a ton of push-back from the status quo.

	When you talk about enlightenment teachers, you're talking about a culture which has very rigid ideas. Enlightenment is only ever talked about within the context of a specific culture.

<p>
	The same being you've always been communicating with: your own self.
</p>

<p>
	It's certainly consciousness.

<p>
	Then why are you communicating on this forum?
</p>

<p>
	ALL communication is like that! That's what you fail to understand. All communication is self-communication. That doesn't make it any less effective.

<p>
	If you become conscious enough you will be able to talk to the person directly by bypassing the idea of telephonic communication.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Consciousness gives you direct immediate communication access to every part of the universe instantly.
</p>

<p>
	To be fully awake is to have faster than light communication. People don't realize how profound this is. You can communicate with any being in the universe, instantly, doesn't even matter if they are alive or dead or real or imaginary. You can have a profound communication with Donald Duck or your dead friend.

<p>
	You have to be careful not to overdo it.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I would stay away from pscyhedelics for at least a year and ground yourself in mundane life. Do the integration work.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like you're a highly sensitive spiritual person and you require a unique path for doing the work. Discover your path.

	It's pretty clear that I will fully become God. It's just a question of how the surrender process will unfold. I have to give up everything. It's a lot to resign to all at once. Gotta take it in stages. It's like eating an elephant.

	Any stage can be violent. It just becomes rarer as you get higher.
</p>

<p>
	Dark shadow tendencies can be present at any stage.

<p>
	You have always existed. You just forgot.
</p>

<p>
	How can you be a human when that is a creation of your mind?
</p>

<p>
	When you look at a tree you already are it, you just think you are a human, which clouds your perception.

	You have no idea what perception is, nor for that matter what a tree is or what you are.

<p>
	No.
</p>

<p>
	This is a specific situation which requires a very careful understanding of mental disorders, spirituality, consciousness, psychedelics, and reality to run it properly.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between counting beans and making connections between complex spiritual things like psychedelics and schizophrenia. A materialist is qualified to count beans, not complex matters of consciousness.

<p>
	"Intellect" here is a very loaded and relative notion. It all depends how you define it and what your goals are.
</p>

<p>
	If you seek Cosmic intelligence & wisdom, that is very different from something like being good at solving logical puzzles or doing academic science. You can train your intellect/mind for all sorts of different tasks.

<p>
	Start by making yourself more compassionate and loving.

	Serious social change can only happen by inner self-transformation. Develop yourself and become a conscious leader. That is what changes society. Not whining about it from behind a screen at home on your couch while pigging out on Cheetos.

<p>
	Absolutely.
</p>

<p>
	But your potential in this material dream is extremely limited even if you are Jesus and can walk on water.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't change the radius of the moon with your mind, you are limited. Do not fool yourself into thinking you are unlimited when you are stuck in a highly limited form. That is my point.
</p>

<p>
	You are only able to do what your form allows you to do. Form is not unlimited. Which is why midgets don't play in the NBA no matter how badly they might want to. You must play to your strengths. Each form has its unique strengths and weaknesses. Find out what yours are. The Life Purpose Course helps you to do this.

<p>
	Every dose is a breakthrough dose.
</p>

<p>
	If I dose any higher, I don't know if I'm coming back. Every time I dose I wonder if this is the end.

	I get more visuals from 5-MeO than from DMT.

Will you just come up with another one?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I think that depends on whatever is best for the maximization of Love.
</p>

<p>
	Basically God cannot not do whatever maximizes Love, because Love is what it is. So if you leave the dream and then it is determined by Infinite Intelligence that it would be best for you to incarnate as some guru who helps others awaken to Love, then that's what will happen. Or if it is determined that it would be best for you to incarnate as a terrorist in order to maximize Love, that's what God will do.
</p>

<p>
	What you're not understanding yet is that God is so loving that it will not hesitate to incarnate as a terrorist/rapist/murderer/racist/etc if that will maximize Love. So all this "evil" stuff is actually the highest sign of God's Love. Imagine how much Love and selflessness it takes to willing to become Hitler because your intelligence has enough vision to see that this would maximize Love for others. The hardest thing is not being a victim, it's being an oppressor. The hardest thing is not being a saint, it's being a devil.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is, to be the greatest devil requires the highest selflessness and love. Because God becomes a devil CONSCIOUSLY! It is not an accident that devils exist. They serve a higher Good which they themselves cannot see while they are incarnated as devils.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine for a moment that Hitler was a good guy before he incarnated. In fact, he was the most loving and selfless soul. And it's because of that that he consciously decided, "Okay, I will take on the role of playing Hitler because I see that this will be necessary for the benefit of others. I will be evil for the good of others because I am that Good/Selfless. I am so strong that I am willing to be a devil for you, to serve in your awakening to Love."
</p>

<p>
	That's how evil actually works. It's the exact opposite of what you think it is.
</p>

<p>
	So when you judge an "evil" person, that is actually a test of your Love. You think you are being good and loving by judging Hitler, but actually it's the opposite, you are being tested by Hitler to see how strong your Love is. Will you pass the test? Most people fail. And that is precisely Hitler's role: to weed out the true lovers from the false ones.
</p>

<p>
	None of this is random or accidental. The highest and most loving intelligence is running the entire show for the benefit of all.
</p>

<p>
	No. God isn't doing anything out of boredom -- as that would be selfish and God has no self at all.
</p>

<p>
	God is LOVE. It cannot do anything but LOVE. Any action God takes is LOVE by tautology. That is the beauty of it. Non-LOVE cannot exist! When you fucking realize this, you understand the nature of reality, and it is utterly profound.
</p>

<p>
	THE ONLY THING THAT CAN EXIST IS LOVE!
</p>

<p>
	Nothing else can come into existence.
</p>

<p>
	Get it?
</p>

<p>
	The limitations are necessary for LOVE to be realized and appreciated.

	None of those statistics or studies can be trusted because they were carried out by materialist fools.

<p>
	Not sure. I have no frame of reference for how DMT would be for me prior to 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	I think the way it works is that as you become more conscious and pure, your trips increase in clarity no matter what the substance until every trip is crazy lucid, like crystal.
</p>

<p>
	For me DMT is crystal lucid, more powerful and clear than 5-MeO. It is the purest form of consciousness imaginable.
</p>

<p>
	It's the only psychedelic I will consume from now on.

	I realize now that all my 5-MeO-DMT trips was preparatory work to lead me to DMT.

	That's right. That is precisely what Love is: God's allowance of and understanding of your selfishness and fear.
</p>

<p>
	You want to remain a devil, and God totally understands and allows it. But then don't be surprised when others around you act like devils. You did that to yourself. Don't blame God for the fact that you chose to stay devil. You want to have it both ways: you want God to allow you to keep being a devil, and you want to blame God for not creating a better world for you.

	They will last for years. There's no reason they should expire unless you heat them up.

<title>How do you awaken if you have trauma?</title>

<p>
	Yes, you're gonna need to work on your traumas. But that doesn't means you have to fix them all before you start pursuing awakening. You can do both at once. Awakening work will bring up your traumas and attachments, which you can then address, heal, forgive, and let go.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are the most powerful way to process and heal trauma.
</p>

<p>
	Don't waste years of your life grinding out traumatic issues with therapists. Just pop a psychedelic and accomplish years of work in one night. Effective healing requires consciousness, not talking.
</p>

	This is just some libertarian stupidity.
</p>

<p>
	Completely overlooks the achievements of the Civil Rights movement and for that matter, abolition and the Civil War.
</p>

<p>
	By this logic black people would still be slaves.
</p>

<p>
	Organization is crucial when the other side is highly organized. Police have very powerful unions that fight for their survival agenda. As do rich people and white people. The entire Republican party is basically a White Lives Matter and Rich Lives Matter organization. And don't forget all the white supremacist groups which are still going strong.

<p>
	Roughly 50mg of harmala extract and 50mg DMT. That results in a very mild trip.
</p>

<p>
	To boost the trip I also vape DMT. It hits like a motherfucker.
</p>

<p>
	For a solid trip without vaping you'll probably need 100mg harmala + 100mg DMT. But be careful. That might be a serious trip which lasts a few hours. You can also try it orally. Taking that much harmala and DMT up the butt isn't so nice. Plugging works best with low volumes.

<p>
	I have verified that plugging harmala extract followed 30 mins later with DMT works. It's basically ayahausca but without the throwing up.
</p>

<p>
	It requires quite a bit of DMT to get a strong trip. But lasts much longer than vaping.

<p>
	Not he, you.

<p>
	Love!
</p>

<p>
	God's only desire is to share its love, but it has no one to share it with because it is alone, so it must share it with itself, and the only way to do that is to forget it is God.
</p>

<p>
	To appreciate Infinite Love you must lose it.
</p>

<p>
	The discovery of Infinite Love IS itself the highest expression of Love.

<p>
	Why can a human not swim as well as a shark? 
</p>

<p>
	Because being in a finite avatar places severe restrictions on you. Your body restricts infinite consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You can't have it both ways. You want to be both unlimited while clinging to all of your limits and attachments out fear. If you cling, you become limited.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be unlimited then go die. Otherwise suffer your limits.

			So basically unless you physically drop death your level of awakening is never 100%?<br />
			Like the highest you can get without dying is like what you got in 30 days retreat probably? Like 99.9% awakening, but not the 100% which would be when you physically drop dead?<br />
			<br />
			So the idea as this avatar is to get to the 99.9%, live and enjoy life and let life put you down in one way or another so that you die and get to the 100%. But if you don't care about life itself, but just to get to the 100% awakening, then the best way to awaken it would actually be killing yourself?<br />
			But then to say it in human terms, it would like an instant that feels like infinity and then you "reincarnate" meaning that you imagine a new world/life? <br />
			I guess from the absolute perspective of infinity all these infinite lives and possibilities are happening at the same time, but to say it in human terms, so in more linear terms you "reincarnate", right?
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't know if God reincarnates after it goes totally infinite. Seems silly to do so. But up to you I guess.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know if natural death will be enough to reach 100%. It might not be. I think to become fully God it has to be a conscious choice to never ever have a self again.

<p>
	Actually blacks did vote for him in the past. But now he will lose many blacks.
</p>

<p>
	It's also a matter of riling up the black vote. In 2016 many black people treated Hilary and Trump as equal. Now they know better and they will show up to the polls as a protest vote against Trump. This is good.

<p>
	Trump shows why voting for Republicans is lunacy.
