<p>
	Yes, consciousness definitely helps ground you and be more detached and authentic. But it's also not a cure-all. Approaching is a very specific skillset which needs to be honed, just like golf or tennis. Consciousness helps with all skillsets but doesn't replace training the skillset.
</p>

<p>
	I would not be immediately in state.

If you're still in school, you should even out and become more stable as you get older and practice more.
</p>

<p>
	As you build more positive habits and shed negative habits you should have less erratic ups and downs in your life.
</p>

<p>
	But the more you try to bull your way through issues, the more backlash you should expect. So maybe less bulling.
</p>

<p>
	Read the book Mastery to learn about the difference between the obsessive mindset and the mastery mindset. The mastery mindset is stable. The obsessive mindset is erratic and prone to catastrophic collapse.
</p>

<p>
	It's also important that you are fueled by positive rather than negative motivation. Negative motion tends to produce a yo-yo effect, defeating itself. Positive motivation is more stable. If you're motivated by avoidance then you'll get all of frustrating yo-yoing. For example, avoiding being overweight or avoiding being poor.

</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		One time an annoyed girl punched me in the mouth and gave me a bloody lip
	</li>
	<li>
		Another time an annoyed drunk girl clawed my neck causing a bloody mess and a scar that I still have
	</li>
	<li>
		Another time a careless girl burned my favorite jacket with her cigarette
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That's about it.
</p>

<p>
	One time a giant guy wanted to beat me up because he thought I touched his wife's ass (which I even didn't). Luckily I was able to back away.
</p>

<p>
	As far as awkward stuff, oh yeah... too much to list. Awkward is my middle name.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. One time I saw a girl step on a broken glass with her bare foot, creating a pool of blood on the dance floor about a meter in diameter. It was like a shark attack. Never go barefoot in the club.
</p>

<p>
	Another time I saw a totally drunk girl getting dragged out of the club across the floor by her hair by security while kicking and screaming.

</p>

<p>
	And the opportunities aren't just sex. I became a life coach after cold approaching a random girl at a bar in Dallas. She told me about the life coach training she was going to and I immediately knew that's what I should do. And the rest was history.
</p>

<p>
	One time in Vegas I accidentally cold approached a life coach who immediately invited me up to her luxury hotel suite to smoke weed (because I knew about life coaching). Then she kicked me out because I didn't want to smoke weed.
</p>

<p>
	Another time in Vegas I accidentally cold approached Tony Robbin's copyrighter and went on a date with her and she told me a bunch of gossip about Tony Robbins. We talked about self-help for hours. She knew all the top self-help authors.
</p>

<p>
	Another time I went on a date with the world's 75th highest ranked Russian tennis player. She was cashing $50,000 checks from her sponsors. She was as hot as you would imagine a Russian tennis player to be.
</p>

<p>
	Another time I met an actress from San Diego with giant boobs. I approached her by telling her she had nice boobs and politely asked if I could fondle them in front of her friends. She of course said yes.
</p>

<p>
	The craziest things materialize when you approach a lot. You would not believe such things were possible. You'd be amazed at the kind of stuff you can get away with.
</p>

<p>
	It's all a numbers game.
</p>

<p>
	One time I was outside the club and bumped into Michael Jordan. Another time I was outside the club and bumped into one of the world's most popular male porn stars. A few months ago I was walking through the casino lobby with a friend and accidentally bumped into Mystery outside the Marquee nightclub. Talk about going full-circle.

		</p>

		<p>
			I actually experienced this very recently tripping. I've tripped looking in mirror more than once and each time it was a totally unique experience. I think psychedelic mirror-working can be either extremely powerful and illuminating or very shadowy, which is also powerful. I feel they're both exquisite and worthwhile experiences. Even as meditative practices, tripping or no tripping.
		</p>

		<p>
			The more recent one I'd say was by far one of the best though. I spontaneously decided to frolic towards a mirror and curiously gaze into it and for the first time in my life I just got completely lost in the reflection with this pure love, peace, ease and divine acceptance flowing through me. Without even really paying attention to my features but simply gazing directly into my eyes and I felt this pure beautiful sense of self-compassion and self-love, could not stop smiling, it wasn't a flashback to Narcissus, it was just genuine metaphysical love and felt so intimate. And I actually felt quite beautiful, from the inside out.
		</p>

		<p>
			For a brief moment of time, it was almost as though I was looking through the eyes of someone else staring into my soul, someone who cares for me, a supportive loved one, a wondrous curious child, or a spiritual mentor/guide, if you will.
		</p>

		<p>
			It was quite literally illuminating as well. Mind you, the lighting in this bathroom was so radiant & luminous and in that moment it felt as though my whole being was encompassed or shattered by the Sun shining down on me, or twinkling stars, the atmosphere felt so glittery and firefly-like so it was quite an intense one haha. Internally I remember reciting "heaven".
		</p>

		<p>
			Since this is the dating domain, perhaps it's appropriate to say for a moment it was like having a soul-traveling date with myself. How to get a girlfriend? Hehe yes, just look in the mirror. ♥ But yes psychedelic bonding with others is just as beautiful too. ♥
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Right, because in the end, there is no one here but you! Anyone who loves you and anyone who you love is just you loving yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone you date is actually yourself!
</p>

<p>
	Anyone you have sex with is actually yourself!
</p>

<p>
	Anyone who's eyes you look into is actually yourself!
</p>

<p>
	It is an absolute truth at you are infinitely beautiful! But this takes some serious consciousness to see. The ego cannot believe it because it is constantly judging everything.
</p>

<p>
	How about instead, seeing this as an opportunity to make yourself into an awesome man?
</p>

<p>
	If you really wanted to, you could go sleep with an 8+ quality girl within the next 3 months. That's how awesome life is. You'd just need to seriously take ownership of this issue and apply yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Or you could keep whining I guess. But whining isn't as fun as banging an 8.
</p>

<p>
	Learning how to get good with girls is very rewarding and empowering. Not sexually, but for your self-esteem and personal development. The thrill of overcoming your inner whimp is actually more of a rush than the sex.

</p>

<p>
	P.S. One of the best guys I know is a 5'2" Pakistani guy. He gets girls like crazy. He is a shark. When he approaches I am in awe. Cause he just feels fully entitled to the girl. Like a king. Girls either love it or they slap him across the face. But either way he gets laid.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to getting girls, a delusional sense of self-confidence and self-love is a must. You have to trick your own mind into believing that any girl would be lucky to sleep with you, and every girl wants you. And you have to be able to handle rejection like a used car salesmen. Any rejection is her loss, her foolishness, because you are obviously the prize.

<title>I'm finally admitting that I suck at talking to women</title>

<p>
	Lol, this isn't exactly a big secret. Basically all guys suck at talking with women unless they trained that skill.
</p>

<p>
	You should approach even if you are not relaxed or "in state". Sure, you will blow up sets, but it doesn't matter because blowing up sets is what gets you to relax.
</p>

<p>
	Never expect your first approach of the day to go smooth. The first few approaches are just warm ups. They almost always blow up. If you're approaching, you should be doing at least 10-20 approaches within a few hours. Once you blow the first 10, then you'll hit state and you will start acing the rest.
</p>

<p>
	The key to learning game is to find a location where you can do 10-20 approaches within a few hours. Find an area with tons of girls so that you aren't worried about blowing sets up. Become an approach machine for a while and your skills will skyrocket.
</p>

<p>
	I remember when I approached 750 girls in one month. That was a productive month! You'll be amazed at what opportunities materialize from 750 approaches. The most unlikeliest of things pan out with those numbers. If you approach 750 girls, one of them will just want to suck your dick for no reason at all, LOL. Most guys don't meet that many girls in their entire lifetime. You can do it in one month.

<title>BIG TURNING POINT AND FEAR</title>

Yes, it's a good idea to develop some solid technical skills. If music is your passion then develop technical skills in that area. So you'll be able to leverage them into the future.

<p>
	Fear is normal.

<p>
	You have already made the hardest choice: to quit your major. Now comes the exciting part of doing what you're actually passionate about. Give yourself some space to figure it out. You don't need to know HOW just yet. Trust that you will figure it out as you go along. But at the same, don't just sit around and wait. Roll up your sleeves and get to work building your dream life.
</p>

<p>
	Teaching yourself technical skills online is easy these days. All that's required is the passion to learn and train. You can be self-taught. No one in the business world really cares about degrees. University degrees are a joke. What they care about is your ability to produce results. I became a video game designer at a world-class studio after a few years of teaching myself video game design skills. I did not get any formal education for it. And learning audio skills is easier than game design skills. You can find many tutorials and courses online. All you really need is an internet connection and lots of free time. If you can live cheaply in Morocco, got back to Morocco and invest a few years learning these skills, build up a solid portfolio and people should want to hire you in Morocco or even abroad in Europe.
</p>

<p>
	All of my knowledge of psychology and personal development is also self-taught. And thanks to that it's way better and deeper than I would get through a psychology degree from Harvard. You can educate yourself way more efficiently on your own, as long as you're passionate about it. Homework, tests, and lectures are all overrated. You can basically teach yourself most things, unless you need a professional license like for a doctor, lawyer, or engineer.

For example, you might be interested in being a counselor or therapist or social worker or teacher or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	If you know for sure that finance is something you hate (and you do), then it would be idiotic to keep pursuing it, trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.
</p>

<p>
	I changed my major half-way through college from Aerospace Engineering because I realized, just like you, that I do not want to work in a cubicle crunching numbers for some defense contractor.
</p>

<p>
	You must follow your passions. But also try to keep an eye on the pragmatics of how you will earn a living. You must develop a clear sense of what your career will be. It is not good enough to just take some major and then have no idea how you will actually earn a paycheck. For example, if you're going to be an English major, then you should also have a practical career plan like: I will be a popular fiction writer and sell books.
</p>

<p>
	Answer this question for yourself: What am I gonna be selling? To make a living, you gotta be selling something. The key is to be selling something you believe in, something you're passionate about.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I sell metaphysical insights that improve people's lives.
</p>

<p>
	What do you sell?
</p>

<p>
	Figure this out NOW! Don't wait! Once you hit the labor force your options will be severely limited and you will be stuck in wage slavery from which it is very difficult to break free. Your plan to escape wage slavery must start NOW. There is no time to waste. Invest some serious time pondering this and laying out a realistic plan.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry about dropping finance. In a few years you won't even remember it mattered. Changing majors is not a big deal. Graduating with a major you hate IS a big deal. It's a big mistake.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	As an adult it's a good idea to take responsibility for love rather than offloading that responsibility onto others.
</p>

<p>
	You are the love you seek from the world.

See, virtually every ego feels like it's not good enough. This is a deeper problem than it first seems. To be an ego is to constantly feel incomplete, inadequate, unlovable, and worthless.
</p>

<p>
	That is solved by spiritual practice and consciousness work. You need to become conscious of how incompleteness, inadequacy, and being unlovable are part of the entire dynamic of being human. These things are the consequence of your deepest held beliefs about life. Those beliefs need to be questioned very deeply.
</p>

<p>
	For example, who what is nobody loves you. Why is that bad or wrong? Why do you need love from others? Contemplate that seriously until you realize that you actually do not need love from others. This will feel counter-intuitive. There will be fear here that you must face head-on.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you should have no problem finding a man as long as you are going out and socializing. Setting boundaries is a separate matter. To set decent boundaries you need to resolve your self-esteem issues.
</p>

<p>
	You might also want to be more conscious of how you screen men. Get more clear about what you want in a man and what you don't want. Be honest about whether your ideal man is actually something you're attracted to. For example, you may say you want a sensitive empathetic man, but then in practice you actually get turned on by loud-mouthed charismatic assholes who would sell their own mothers a lemon car. Often what you get attracted to on the front end is not the ideal guy to be in a relationship with.
</p>

<p>
	The man is not going to help you believe in yourself. You must do that on your own.
</p>

Yes, of course Absolute Infinity is the ultimate answer to everything. But we can also still ask the question, are there aliens on Mars? And the answer might turn out to be Yes!
</p>

<p>
	Likewise there may be a soul of which you are still as yet unawares. No one is saying that the soul is the Absolute Godhead.

</p>

<p>
	Enlightened masters do not say they see unicorns but they do speak of past lives. So clearly there is something they are pointing to. What is that thing?
</p>

<p>
	If I point at a kangroo to someone who has never seen a kangroo, and you say, "Oh, well, it is all an illusion anyways. No need to look." That would be a mistake. Something is being missed.

	The problem with this is, many of the greatest enlightened masters report direct experience of past lives.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Generally I agree.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, science is moving ahead and it may one day have to map out stuff like souls and perhaps even figure out a way to create them.
</p>

<p>
	For example, maybe it's possible to use the science of souls to create a robot with a soul.

<p>
	That would be an improper definition. When people talk of souls that is different from the Absolute. The Absolute is universal, formless, and infinite. A soul is localized and limited.
</p>

<p>
	When we talk about souls we are talking: Body >> Mind >> Soul >> Absolute Self
</p>

<p>
	Each of those levels is less fundamental than the first. With Body being least fundamental.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute does not necessarily preclude souls. Souls could be an intermediate structure between Body/Mind and the Absolute.

<title>Music - Spirituality or Nature?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31457-music-spirituality-or-nature/?do=findComment&amp;comment=367744</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Of course people enjoy music because it has a spiritual quality to it.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, that's true of all art. The point of art is to connect us with spirit.
</p>

<p>
	Spirit and nature are identical. In fact, everything is spirit, so you could probably make anything into a vehicle for spirituality, like peeling potatoes.
</p>

<p>
	Music seems to have a hypnotic effect on the mind unlike other activities like peeling potatoes. Which makes music useful for changing people's emotional states. Which is a doorway to changing people's states of consciousness. Shamans use repetitive beating to induce shamanic trances and enable astral projection.
</p>

<p>
	In our modern materialist culture, where virtually everyone is disconnected from spirit and God, music becomes an easy alternative to undertaking the hero's journey. Which is why it's so popular and so shared. It's like spirituality for the spiritually-clueless, lazy, and cynical masses.
</p>

<p>
	It is fascinating how the human animal is like the only animal that digs music. Why don't cats tap their foot to the beat? That would be a great question for some neuroscientist to research.
</p>

<p>
	If souls exist they must have a beginning. Since the only thing without a beginning is the Absolute itself. And the whole point of the notion of a soul is that it's localized and finite, as soul is precisely not the Absolute Godhead.
</p>

<p>
	If souls exist, they are subtle forms. Which means they are born and die just like all forms.
</p>

<p>
	Before there was life on Earth, I would expect that there were no souls. So souls must have arose alongside the evolution of life.

			Well, karma theory doesn't allow that souls "begin" at all. They are eternal. Even at the end of a world cycle they go right back into storage and come back out. This leaves a lot to be explained, of course (one of karma theory's many downsides!)
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But supposedly a soul must have a beginning, even if it lasts across multiple lifetimes. The universe did not start out with human souls. They had to be created, and with a full and final liberation they end. They must also be individuated from other souls since all people do not share the same samskaras and past-lives. And just how many souls are there? 7 billion? What happens when the human population doubles? Is there an infinite number of human souls sitting around waiting for the Earth's population to grow before they can take Earthly form? Where did these 7 billion souls come from? Why would they exist long before humans were even a species? Seems like an ineffective design. Or are human souls the recycled souls of dinosaurs?
</p>

<p>
	So the question is, when these souls were born many life-times ago, were they all equally spiritually capable? Or were some more capable than others? Is the soul of a Neanderthal the same as the soul of a Homo Sapien?
</p>

<p>
	Lots of questions arise when it comes to souls and past lives.
</p>

<title>Are enlightened/ actualised people free from depression?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/31417-are-enlightened-actualised-people-free-from-depression/?do=findComment&amp;comment=367732</link>

</p>

<p>
	Through spiritual practice, through consciousness work, you can learn how depression is caused by the meanings your mind creates, and you can train yourself to stop having those negative thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to be depressed if you fully in the present moment, not lost in the conceptual past or future. But this will takes lots of mindfulness training to actualize. It's not enough to merely know it intellectually.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is not just about enlightenment. It's about emotional mastery. You must become more conscious of how your mind creates emotional states and how it assigns meaning to an otherwise meaningless world. You don't need to be enlightened to start developing mindfulness over your emotions. Nor will enlightenment automatically give you mastery of your emotions.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend to burn this candle from both ends.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, you need some "agenda" to bootstrap your spiritual journey. You can shed the agenda later, once you're towards the end. Careful not to burn the bridge before you've crossed.
</p>

<title>A Rant Against Science and Religion</title>

<p>
	The question of What is science? and Why does it work? is a very deep mystery. One worth seriously contemplating. I have resolved many question about existence for myself, and I have studied the foundations of science for over decade, but I have not yet resolved that one.
</p>

<p>
	What is understanding? How can we understand understanding?
</p>

<p>
	Genuine insight is a very real thing. Enlightenment is a genuine understanding of the structure of existence. So in a sense, enlightenment is a kind of science.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise, one can have a genuine insight into how to build an airplane or how to cure a disease or how to solve a differential equation. Which is different from pure fantasy.
</p>

Did Tiger Wood spend many lifetimes playing golf?
</p>

<p>
	Why not apply this logic across the board?
</p>

<p>
	But if you acknowledge there are natural differences in golfing ability across people, why not for spirituality as well?
</p>

<p>
	Does every human soul start existence with identical spiritual capacities? Why would that be so?
</p>

	Because Spira is the living embodiment of anti-cult-like. Which is how the best spiritual teachers are.
</p>

<p>
	Where are the Rupert Spira groupies with Rupert Spira tattoos and mugs?
</p>

<p>
	Like I said before, the highest sign of mastery is humility. It's very hard for the devil to fake.

<p>
	He is acting out stage Blue/Orange with a massively repressed Green shadow. Which is a common developmental pathology at his level.
</p>

<p>
	The danger with taking his teachings too seriously is that he will corrupt your mind with his massive Green shadow, causing you to have a massive Green shadow, thus stunting your growth to higher levels.
</p>

<p>
	His politics is also helping to maintain the status quo of corruption, American Exceptionalism, and mass income inequality as he resists systemic reform of capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, of course some of his teachings can be valuable. Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
</p>

<p>
	Very few teachers are 100% wrong. Rather, it's a question of how developmentally advanced, accurate, and healthy are their teachings? Is he teaching you pathological stuff like duality, judgment, hatred, demonization, dogma, illusions, division? Or is he teaching you love, consciousness, truth, integration, holism?

</blockquote>

<p>
	The hero goes through lots of suffering of course. My point is, the hero isn't undertaking his journey in order to suffer. Suffering isn't his motive.
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha didn't seek suffering, he sought the Holy Grail (an escape from the inevitability of death). Suffering was just a by-product of seeking the Holy Grail.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking it's good to have positive motivation for whatever you are doing, not negative one. Seeking rather than avoiding.

	Hare Krishnas a very dogmatic folks. Many of them are just brainwashed believers who have never approached awakening.
</p>

<p>
	This is the classic problem with religion: people belief stuff without ever validating it through consciousness work. Which is actually worse than atheism. At least the atheist values empirical investigation, albeit a crippled materialistic version of it.

Don't try to redefine it using other words. It is what it is. Find it in your direct experience and observe how it works. It is a sort of emotive force. Some people have more of this force, others less.

<p>
	You will only reach equanimity when you are fully conscious of what consciousness. And that is only possible directly, without analogy.
</p>

<p>
	Analogy, metaphor, and symbols are the only things separating you from God consciousness. You are going 1 step too far. You must take the zeroth step to reach yourself.

<title>An analogy for consciousness</title>

<p>
	Look around the room. Everything you see is consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	No analogy needed when you are neck-deep in water.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really analogize consciousness because since everything is consciousness, your analogy is itself consciousness.

	I don't think of it that way.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't feel like a negative need. It feels more like a postive need to express oneself. Like life bursting forth with creative enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
	There is this passion for creating stuff just for the sake of creation.

	I have found that some people just aren't into creativity. It has always baffled me because my entire life is dominated by creativity. Like 24/7 creativity mode.

</p>

<p>
	What differentiates science from pure fiction?

I guess you could also have that as a third class, since some folks are ambitious but not so imaginative, like the Wallstreet banker types.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously there are many ways to classify people. I was speaking of one distinction I have spotted over the years of dealing with people. I have run across people with very little ambition and they don't seem to care.

<p>
	From what I have seen there are two types of people: ambitious people and unambitious ones. Ambitious people crave a life purpose to work on. Unambitious people are happy working at the Post Office licking stamps. Unambitious people seem to have no vision or concern for their impact on the world.
</p>

<p>
	It would make sense that such is the case since society needs a lot of stamp lickers and factory workers.
</p>

<p>
	But I think it is also the case that a lot of folks would be more ambitious and visionary if they were shown how and given more opportunity. The degree of income inequality and our medival education system destroy a lot of potentially ambitous people from flourishing.
</p>

<p>
	That will not be enough.
</p>

<p>
	You're not appreciating the depth of the problem here.
</p>

<p>
	You were never born. Logic, science, and cause & effect are total illusions.
</p>

<p>
	Merely reflecting on this will not be enough. You must do an industrial-grade spiritual practice to change your state of consciousness because from your current state you are totally stuck, like a character in a video game world.
</p>

<p>
	Or, psychedelics. That would be the fastest way to blow up your materialist logical paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Logically you can understand whatever you want, but when it comes to actually facing your own death, all logic will fly out the window. This is a profoundly personal matter for you. How willing are you to die to know the Truth? Because that is what we are talking about when we say nonduality.

Suffering leads to legit spiritual purification, growth, and even awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering doesn't only seek pleasure.
</p>

<p>
	And ceasing to exist and nonduality "experience" are the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Do not take things that spiritual teachers say as absolutes. They are partial points of view. Sadhguru is never telling you the whole truth.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Many people who awaken are driven to it by intense suffering and dissatisfaction with everyday life.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is the greatest teacher. Once you suffer enough, you'll be ready to say: "I give up! I surrender!"
</p>

<p>
	Suffering DOES create seeking. But of course most people don't know about enlightenment at all, so they suffer without knowing the ultimate solution.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering is not needed to complete the hero's journey. It's just that in practice, if you have an easy life, you will get hypnotized by the comfort and probably never undertake the hero's journey to begin with, nor will you persevere past all the challenging obstacles.
</p>

<p>
	I've never suffered more than during meditation retreats. You have to be willing to go through some self-inflicted conscious suffering in order to awaken. Awakening is not the path of least resistance. It is like training for the Olympics. It comes with sacrifice. You must surrender your easy, unconscious life.
</p>

<p>
	There is a higher drive within the ego which seeks God. It's like a faint whisper amidst a sea of egoic noise. That faint whisper is what ultimately leads to awakening if you listen to it and act on it.
</p>

<title>My first BARELY TRIPPED trip report</title>

<p>
	Prepare your setting better. You should already had prepared snacks before hand.
</p>

<p>
	See, all of that moving around and playing around is distracting you from going deep into the trip. It's okay for now as you are just getting acquainted with shrooms, but serious tripping requires you sit still and focus. Falling alseep is not good.
</p>

<p>
	You've barely scratched the surface. Higher doses will get very twisted.
</p>

<title>Teal Swan and Her Teaching?</title>

<p>
	If even half the stuff in that article is true, it's a serious problem.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I have no idea if that article is true. You'd have to research further.
</p>

<p>
	As soon as I hear that someone is starting an unstoppable organization to awaken the world: that screams cult to me. That thing is gonna fly off the rails and cause more harm than good.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, I see big red flags here. Her videos can of course still be helpful. Cults are often founded on helpful teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Can anyone actually verify if some of the stuff in the article is accurate?
</p>

<p>
	A properly woke person should not be engaging in such nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	Glad I released that Cult Psychology series. Lots of cultists wannabees around lately.

<p>
	Mushrooms are really good for seeing your own inner beauty. Try taking mushrooms while looking in a mirror. They can show you how to love yourself regardless of how you look. They can also show you have to be more authentic, more charismatic, and more masculine.
</p>

<p>
	Girls love psychedelics too. They're great for bonding.

<p>
	Of course it's easier to be more confident when you are more physically attractive.
</p>

<p>
	Just like it's easier to start a biz when your daddy gave you a $100 million inheritance.
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean you can't start a successful business from zero.
</p>

<p>
	Be self-made. Stop looking for hand-outs from the universe. You must play the hand you've been dealt.
</p>

<p>
	It's all inner game.
</p>

	Fuel costs are pretty high for RVs.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, parking your RV in an RV park will cost $30/night at least.
</p>

<p>
	Living in a decent RV is actually more expensive than a one bedroom apartment in Vegas.

<p>
	Joe Rogan is wrong. Male and female is a conceptual category.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is a conceptual category does not mean it isn't useful. The whole point of concepts is that they are highly useful for survival, since you yourself, and life itself, are a category!
</p>

<p>
	This issue goes way deeper than Rogan can fathom.
</p>

<p>
	Not only can man and woman be deconstructed, your very existence as a biological being can be deconstructed. But of course, no one wants to go there.
</p>

<p>
	Biology itself is a category. Difference itself is a category. Even Joe Rogan is a category!

<p>

When I did my first try, 22 mg was a really low dose. I saw here that there was a recent influx of 5-Meo on the market, after a long dry spell? Maybe this new batch that they're now selling is just weaker.

<p>
	No, I know from experience that people react to 5-MeO-DMT very differently than me.
</p>

<p>
	I think difference in brain types accounts for it. I have a very metaphysically-oriented mind and personality. Most people are just not like that.

<p>
	Small to medium doses of 5-MeO-DMT can be more uncomfortable and frustrating than large doses. Because with a large dose the ego is just effortlessly wiped out.
</p>

<p>
	At smaller doses the ego tends to fight back.
</p>

<p>
	But for me, a 20mg dose is full God consciousness. I'm not sure why some of you need such high doses to get a breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so much the meditation, it's the contemplation that's more important for psychedelics I think.

	You can study science using a holistic, integral approach.

<p>
	Of course reality has no categories, we create them. But at the same time some categorization schemes are more useful than others.
</p>

<p>
	Careful with your assumptions.
</p>

<p>
	Human evolution is accelerating. The world is changing a lot faster today than it was 5000 years ago for the Egyptians. And Egyptian history has been broken up into more than a few periods. There is close to 5000 years of ancient Egyptian history. We would probably break it up into a lot more periods if we had more accurate records. Modern history is a lot more dense because we have much better records of it.
</p>

<p>
	I would just take the Spiral Dynamics model as it is, without trying to re-invent it.

There is no such thing as evil. You are making it up.
</p>

<p>
	Everything that happens in the Universe is Good, by definition.
</p>

<p>
	You can clean up your "bad habits" of course. But that doesn't make you a "good" person.
</p>

<p>
	You are simply free to be however you want. There is really no alternative. You will be you regardless of what you do.

<p>
	That is correct.
</p>

<p>
	But it would not change the fact that it's an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	Truth and survival are two very different things.

That is great. That is helpful.
</p>

<p>
	What I was speaking against is orthodox religious approaches, which try to get you to be a "good and moral person".
</p>

<p>
	The Work has nothing to do with being a "good person". In fact, it's the opposite. It's about accepting evil and your own inadequacies.
</p>

<p>
	The key is that you need to become conscious of how much you judge things and reject things, and stop doing that.
</p>

<p>
	You must recognize that good and bad have no place in consciousness work. The truth is neither good nor bad. Good and bad are always actions of the ego-mind. Stop thinking of anything as good or bad. Become more interested in what is.
</p>
