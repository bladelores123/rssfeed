	Materialism is horseshit. But that doesn't mean you can all the sudden avoid common life consequences.

<p>
	Stop linking those two things in your mind.

<p>
	In stage Blue society getting laid is a lot easier because you just go to church and marry some girl your church friends introduce you to.
</p>

<p>
	But also, men have been hitting on women since the dawn of time. You just learn about it today thanks to the internet.
</p>

<p>
	Bars and clubs and alcohol exist for one reason: for people to get laid.
</p>

<p>
	We live in a highly alienated time and culture.
</p>

<p>
	You know, in Quaker society none of the boys have a problem getting laid. Their parents just set them up to marry the girl next door.
</p>

<p>
	My dad met my mom by approaching her on a street corner. If he didn't have the balls to approach her, I wouldn't be here, and neither would you.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You fundamentally misunderstand what pickup is about.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about running a script. It's about learning how to be authentic. Guys struggle with social awkwardness A LOT. Guys are not as socially intuitive as women who practice socialization their entire lives.
</p>

<p>
	Again, you're not understanding because you have no genuine curiosity in this topic. You're looking at it and judging it from your female self-agenda.
</p>

<p>
	What you're doing is akin to me telling women: Don't watch any YT make up videos and don't shop for panties at Victoria's Secret and don't do anything to improve yourself. Don't wear heals. Don't wear bras. Don't do your hair up. Don't shave your legs. Don't shave your pussy. Don't do your nails. Don't hold in your farts. Don't go out and don't socialize at night with any guys. Just sit at home, be normal, and you'll get a great husband.

<p>
	When stuck in a loop, the best thing to do is to force your body to move to override any thoughts and simply change the environment. Walk outside, or crawl to another room, or go to the bathroom, or run a bath, or turn on and dance to some happy music, etc. It tends to work really well. But you must DO IT, rather than think about doing it. Train yourself to use your body to override thought, rather than thinking about using your body.

	Everything is imaginary, but that does not mean you get to imagine whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	By your silly logic I should be able to turn into a dragon on command and shoot fireballs out my ass.
</p>

<p>
	What you're missing is that Leo's ego is not in control. I could die tomorrow of cancer and none of that would contradict my metaphysics, since God is a tautology, God -- paradoxically -- cannot change anything about himself, and is perfect no matter what happens.
</p>

<p>
	It is the ego which thinks it can control reality and have all its wishes fulfilled. Awakening does not grant you control over reality. It merely surrenders you to whatever reality happens to be.
</p>

<p>
	If an enlightened person breaks his leg, he must go to a traditional doctor to fix it. He can't just wish it away. And yet, that broken leg is of course imaginary. Just because something is imaginary does not mean that ego gets to control it.
</p>

<p>
	Make no mistake about it, when your health deteriorates enough, your entire life will crumble. Doesn't matter how enlightened you are. Your ability to live is 100% contingent on good health -- which could go at any moment for a thousand different reasons.
</p>

<p>
	You could get hit by a bus tomorrow. And enlightenment will not save you from that.
</p>

<p>
	If a guy doesn't hunt you, how you ever gonna find a guy?
</p>

<p>
	You're looking at this the wrong way. You are seeing this as hurting women when actually helping men become better men creates more quality men for you ladies to marry.
</p>

<p>
	The problem here is not simply one of getting laid. The problem here is one of how to make better men. You are not going to have quality men when they are too scared to approach a woman. Those men will be socially awkward, bitter, hateful incels.
</p>

<p>
	You want to date an incel? Log into their forum and have you pick. If you dare.
</p>

<p>
	You are looking at this sitution in such a narrow and selfish way. As if all that matters is you.
</p>

<p>
	Men need an avenue for how to learn to date and be strong. It just needs to be done ethically.

<title>Politics &amp; Government Book List</title>

<p>
	Let's pull together a list of the best books on politics and governance.
</p>

<p>
	I'm noticing that one of the biggest challenges with politics is that people (including myself) are just damn ignorant of the historical facts of governance and geo-politics from around the world. We spend way too much time debating culture war issues and partisan demonization vs actually studying how societies around the world have been managed.
</p>

<p>
	Politics and governance is not my area of expertise, but I want expand into it more. I want you guys to become more educated about it too. To do that I feel we need to build a foundation with books.
</p>

<p>
	So search the web for the best political book lists. I'm talking about non-partisan, non-ideological stuff. Well-researched stuff. Stuff that goes into the details of how government works.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I want a list of books that Michael Brooks from the Majority Report was reading. See what you can find. It shouldn't just be about American politics but international politics.
</p>

	If God wasn't on board with it, it couldn't be happening. God's on board with everything, so it's a moot point.

	Don't invoke the name of God to justify your judgment and rejection of reality.

</p>

<p>
	God had to see what it was getting itself into before it pulled the trigger to incarnate into it.
</p>

<p>
	So imagine seeing everything that happened to Hitler from a birds-eye-view, and then saying, "Okay, now let me jump in there and live through it all." That takes some balls.

			That's a bit shortsighted.  The US helped established their power in the first place.
		</p>

		<p>
			"US intelligence helped Saddam's Ba`ath Party seize power for the first time in 1963. Evidence suggests that Saddam was on the CIA payroll as early as 1959, when he participated in a failed assassination attempt <u><strong>against Iraqi strongman Abd al-Karim Qassem</strong></u>. In the 1980s, the US and Britain backed Saddam in the war against Iran, giving Iraq arms, money, satellite intelligence, and even chemical & bio-weapon precursors. As many as 90 US military advisors supported Iraqi forces and helped pick targets for Iraqi air and missile attacks."
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You contradict your own point with your own words.
</p>

<p>
	As you quote above, prior to Saddam was someone as bad as or worse than Saddam.
</p>

<p>
	So even if the CIA had no intervention at all in Iraq, the only person who would be capable of ruling and unifying Iraq would be a brutal strongman akin to Saddam or Qassem -- or worse.
</p>

<p>
	That's because a stage Purple/Red society cannot be ruled by anything but a ruthless dictator. The CIA's meddling cannot change this. The CIA merely exploits the situation to favor America's survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Saddam was not born a dictator. He became a dictator because he had to in order to survive in the environment he lived in. And the same would be true of anyone else who took his place. This is not a problem of one or two bad guys. This is a structural problem of the state of society.
</p>

<p>
	So it is your view that is short-sighted.
</p>

<p>
	I think his work has been personally attacked a lot by Green and it was never really accepted within Green academia.
</p>

<p>
	Wilber also clearly understands the limitations of Green.
</p>

<p>
	But I think what Wilber misses is that even though university culture is Green, he does not appreciate that the rest of the country not even at Green yet. Wilber wants us to leap into Yellow without appreciating that first majority of the country has to solidly enter Green.
</p>

<p>
	I think that given how smart and advanced Wilber is, he's over-estimating the rest of the populace who haven't even finish university and have no idea the lessons of post-modernism.
</p>

<p>
	Wilber is criticizing Green from above, but he doesn't realize that 50% of the country is opposed to Green from below and that that 50% will have to be forced into Green before we start moving into Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	What the last 4 years of Trumpism has shown us is that America is less developed than most of us thought, that a transition to solid Green is still decades away, and Yellow will not happen in our lifetimes.
</p>

<p>
	The key takeaway is this: however bad Green universities are, the rest of the country is in far worse shape. We have a lot of work to do just to get the rest of the country to the same development level as liberal universities, and even once we accomplish that, we'll still have all of the Green problems to deal with.
</p>

<p>
	We are not going to magically leap from Blue/Orange to Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Hard to say. Some deaths sure do look like freak accidents.

<p>

	People do grow by making mistakes, but they also may not. There's no way you can know for sure.
</p>

<p>
	It's a gamble. It's a red flag.
</p>

<p>
	But also, if you go forward with him, if you hold this against him, it will sour the chance of him redeeming himself. Don't let it eat away at your mind.

<title>Landlords &amp; Abolishing Private Property</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/51895-landlords-abolishing-private-property/?do=findComment&amp;comment=676566</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/31-society-environment-government-politics/">Society, Environment, Government, Politics</a></span>

<p>
	Maybe in 300 years we could abolish landlording. But in our lifetimes it will not happen.
</p>

<p>
	Landlords being parasites is a partial truth. In many ways they are, but in some ways they incur risk of investment and add value.
</p>

<p>
	The practical solution is to create regulations which reduce the most parasitic forms of landlording. In general we need to tax passive income a lot higher than non-passive income. And we could tax people who own excessive amounts of property so that there's plenty for everyone and no monopolies.
</p>

<p>
	Taxes, taxes, taxes, -- is the simple solution.
</p>

<p>
	Making profit is important and essential to any business, so on that point Marxists are being dumb. Biz needs surplus to survive and expand. Profit is only a problem when it gets exessive and at the expense of others. Not all profit is at the expense of others.
</p>

<p>
	God cannot be Love unless it allows you to be selfish.
</p>

<p>
	If God hated or judged selfishness, that would make God evil/selfish.
</p>

<p>
	So by asking God to eliminate selfishness, you are asking God to be a devil.
</p>

<p>
	Only selfish people have a problem with selfishness. Get it?

<p>
	Because the whole point of the dream was to create a foil for awakening. God cannot share the gift of Infinite Love with anyone because it is alone. Thus God can only share it with itself by forgetting it is God.
</p>

<p>
	It is the ultimate act of Love.
</p>

<p>
	You can only appreciate the infinite by enduring the limitions of the finite.

<p>
	Be a man and go get the girls you want! You are the hunter. Stop sitting around waiting for them to hunt you. You should be the one who's screening girls to find which ones are worthy of your love.
</p>

<p>
	If a girl can't see how awesome you are, that's her stupidity and it is beneath you to try to second-guess yourself by assuming she is somehow right. Own your awesomeness rather than waiting for girls to validate it for you. Adopt the frame of a man who understands his own worth regardless of what the outside world is telling you.
</p>

<p>
	When the outside world tells you that you're not awesome, you need to tell yourself, "They're crazy! I'm even more awesome than I previously realized. How can they be so blind?"

Your entire life dissolves into the sweetest purest Love. Visual field becomes infinite just like all other 'perceptions', but these are largely unchanged.

<title>Freebase DMT vs Changa?</title>

<p>
	Obviously the more potent the dose the higher your chances of a breakthrough into the deepest truths.
</p>

<p>
	Pure DMT is extremely powerful. Changa is a milder form of it. But you can always just vape less DMT and get the same mild effect. It's just a matter of dialing in your dose. Pure DMT is more flexible since you can dose it low or high, depending on your mood.

	Awakening is not as restrictive as you imagine. It frees you up to do whatever will make you happiest. God is not gonna force you to do anything you don't want to do.

<p>
	If you don't have the eyes to see it, it isn't the case because perspective is everything.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is that if you're deluded, that delusion IS your reality.
</p>

<p>
	So in a very real sense, God does not exist for an atheist until such time that an atheist is able to see God. Then God comes into existence.

<p>
	No, because you are asking for a contradiction. You asking asking God to create a cat which is actually a dog. Even God cannot do that. You must be clear and consistent about what you want God to create. You can't ask for a cat and then complain that it doesn't look like a dog.
</p>

<p>
	For reality to exist as you know it, God has to fool itself into looking at reality in a narrow, finite way. Which means God has to trick itself into not being omniscient. How can God trick itself that it isn't God so that it could experience reality from some other position other than God? You see how challenging that is for God to do? So God's trick must be extremely clever, otherwise God will see right through it and the illusion of immateriality will collapse before it even gets off the ground. This is why all of reality is so sneaky and deceptive. Material reality hinges on the sneakiness of consciousness. If consciousness wasn't being sneaky, material reality would collapse just like waking up from a dream. The dreamer must be entranced by the dream in order to dream.

<p>
	It's a great question.
</p>

<p>
	The answer is, because reality is an illusion. It can only exist as an illusion, so consciousness must trick and deceive itself into buying into a material world.
</p>

<p>
	Just for birth to occur a great trick must be played on you.
</p>

<p>
	You see, if God didn't trick itself, God would be fully awake and fully omniscient. And so there could not be life or material reality.
</p>

Girls who love their man are eager to please and be emotionally available for him.
</p>

<p>
	A girl which isn't like that probably has serious childhood trauma to work out. Probably a history of abuse, molestation, rape, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You need to carefully dig deep into her past to figure out who hurt her.

	Businesses pay 50% in tax???

<p>
	The WTF is Joe Rogan smoking by accepting this nonsense? Most giant corporations pay 0% to 10% in effective taxes.
</p>

<p>
	Rogan is too tolerant of these stage Blue/Orange fools. He doesn't push back on their ideology effectively enough.
</p>

<p>
	Joe Biden more socialist than Sweden? This guy is a joke.
</p>

<p>
	America used to have a top income tax rate of 70%-80% from 1930's to 1970's. It worked well to maintain a healthy middle class. Was America socialist in 1950, 1960, 1970??? This is just ahistorical horseshit.

<p>
	You are free to pursue whatever natural cancer cures you want on your own.
</p>

<p>
	But you are not free to promote cancer cures which have not been rigorously tested by the FDA, as this can be very harmful in ways you cannot imagine.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't see the wisdom in that, that's on you, not the government.
</p>

<p>
	Government's job is to maintain basic standards of scientific rigor and to prevent quacks from selling you snake oil. Do you know how many bullshit cancer cures exist out there in the alternative medicine marketplace?

Haha!
</p>

<p>
	Guys gonna jerk off. It's what we do. It ain't cheating.
</p>

<p>
	Jerking off is what keeps you from cheating on her. Guys crave far more sexual variety than women and we are horny much more often overall. She's never gonna meet all your sexual needs nor should she want that as it would be a full-time job.
</p>

<p>
	She needs to come to peace with this and be happy that you're willing to be loyal to her in the first place. Most guys won't be.

			How do you know when you "have it right?". That is you know the liberals are more accurate than conservatives on this issue.  At which point do you conclude one perspective is better than another?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is difficult to explain.
</p>

<p>
	Basically it requires a lot of study and ultimate raising your consciousness, development level, and love.
</p>

<p>
	If you carefully observe how and why conservatives deny systemic racism, you can start to see their self-bias, hypocrisy, double-standards, ahisortisicism, ideology, lack of compassion, and mental gymnastics. Their own minds are tricking them into constructing and defending a self-serving ideology. That's what all these people like Ben Shapiro, Dave Rubin, Charlie Kirk, Steven Crowder, Tucker Carlson, Jordan Peterson, etc. are doing. They are not serious intellectuals. They are guardians and peddlers of ideology. They have no genuine desire for seeking Truth or becoming more conscious. They are zombies parroting ideology.
</p>

<p>
	If you study them closely you will notice it.
</p>

<p>
	Of course liberals and progressives also parrot ideology, but to a lesser degree, and their positions are more open, more conscious, more historical, more accurate, more healthy, more inclusive, more loving, and less ideological overall.

			Can you give some examples of what you consider healthy masculine man? All my life i struggle to find my authentic masculinity somethimes or feels like jou have to follow the "player,alpha males,badboy shit otherwise you  consider to be a beta, Simp,Nice guy,loser gUy. Maybe the so called Alpha males get the money girls status buth that wont make youreally happy i think. Seems like everyone follows them tough hell.. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe you can make a video on masculinity i think many men wil like it
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	I will make a deep video about how to build a health and deep masculine frame.
</p>

<p>
	In the meantime, I like what Beau has to say about masculinity. He's a good role-model if you're looking for an example of healthy, mature masculinity:

	That's any stage Orange or below patriarchal society/culture.

<p>
	Red, Blue, Orange are all toxicly masculine because they create a shadow out of the feminine.

<p>
	To me, toxic masculinity is a sort of insecure, over-compensating masculinity that tries to be overly macho because it is uncomfortable with its own feminine aspects. It makes a shadow out of the feminine. It demonizes homosexuality. It glorifies patriarchy. It thinks men are superior to women. It treats women as objects. It lacks empathy, intuition, heart, compassion, and love. It's materialistic. It's ethnocentric. It's about traditional gender roles. It's about domination of others. It's immature, juvenile, insecure, angry, bitter, conservative, regressive, reactionary, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Redpill, MGTOW, incels, PUA culture, Jordan Peterson, Steven Crowder, etc.

	Reaching the Tier 2 stages will require most people more time.
</p>

<p>
	Yellow and Turquoise at 26 would be pretty rare because most people at that age are still just starting to get a handle on Orange and Green.
</p>

<p>
	I didn't even know Turquoise existed until my 30's.

	Look, bro, that is 0.00001% of people.

<p>
	Your average poor person is a racist, homophobe, bigot, ignoramus.

<p>
	When we talk about politics, we have to consider averages and lowest common denominators. Citing a few exceptional counter-examples is not smart here.

	Not as much as you'd think. Most poor people are stage Blue. They are easily fooled and misled by demagogues like Trump. Their fears are easily stoked. Their prejudices, closedmindedness, and ethnocentrism is easily exploited by charlatans and narcissists.

<p>
	FDA != Big Pharma
</p>

<p>
	The FDA has extremely rigorous standards which are difficult and expensive to clear.
</p>

<p>
	Clearing all 3 phases of the FDA approval process usually costs tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. Obviously no natural supplement or herb will have enough research funding behind it to clear that bar.
</p>

<p>
	It's not a conspiracy theory. The FDA is not some evil bad guy holding back natural remedies in order to make the big pharma more $$$. The FDA simply has a very high bar for what they are allowed to endorse because millions of lives depend on it. Just because some natural remedy worked for a few people does not at all mean that it would pass rigorous scientific testing.
</p>

<p>
	If you really care to understand how FDA approval works, listen to Rick Doblin, he's an expert on this:

<p>
	Of course it's complicated, but the rich are smarter than the poor generally speaking.
</p>

<p>
	Beware this Marxist idea that the poor are somehow equal to the rich, equally capable as the rich, and equally smart/wise as the rich. This is a dangerous idea. The poor are, for the most part, idiots. This doesn't mean there aren't some rich who are idiots. There certainly are. And it doesn't mean that the smartest rich are deeply spiritually wise. But the rich are generally smarter and wiser and more competent than the poor.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget. People without college degrees vote overwhelmingly conservative and for buffoons like Trump.
</p>

<p>
	As bad as you might think being ruled by the rich is, being ruled by the poor would be way worse. Rule by the poor will lead to stuff like fascism and genocide.
</p>

<p>
	Believe it or not, rich people are actually MORE morally developed and conscious than poor people. Poor people simply have less opportunity and ambition to abuse it.
</p>

<p>
	Poor people are not your friend and they will not save society from evil.
</p>

<p>
	Progressives and socialists are way too enamored with poor people and populism. Populism is not some automatic good. Populism can cause all sorts of devilry.

<p>

<p>
	Of course.

<p>
	We need a special of tier of higher taxes for large multi-national corporations.

<p>
	We need stronger enforcement of existing tax laws and eliminating of loopholes.

<p>
	We need to stop all off-shore tax havens.

<p>
	We need to raise capital gains taxes.

<p>
	We need tiers of wealth taxes on wealth over $10 million, $100 million, $1 billion, $10 billion, and $100 billion.
</p>

<p>
	We need to tax luxury and elite goods more. Stuff like yachts, jets, expensive jewelry, expensive mansions, private islands, fur coats, exotic cars, expensive wine, etc.
</p>

<p>
	We need much higher estate and inheritance taxes.
</p>

<p>
	We need to tax 2nd, 3rd, and 4th homes at ever higher rates for each new home. If you're buying a 4th home you should be paying 75% of that in tax.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Nothing can survival indefinitely. Survival is always limited.
</p>

<p>
	In practice civilization is like The Ship Of Theseus:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus</a>
</p>

<p>
	It is constantly changing every day such that it never stays that same. Just like your body.
</p>

<p>
	Every object in the Universe is constantly dying and being reborn as something else.
</p>

<p>
	Don't think of it as collapse or death. It's evolution and shapeshifting.
</p>

<p>
	God is an Infinite Shapeshifter.

<p>
	Why? Isn't it obvious that you are more conscious when you are sober or meditating than when you are in a food coma?

<p>
	It hasn't changed.
</p>

<p>
	You just need to add to your model that consciousness comes in degrees of self-awareness and various states.

<p>
	Consciousness is like water. It can be murky or crystal clear and everything in between.

<p>
	That is tricky because there can be so much nuance in how those terms are defined by which people.
</p>

<p>
	It's just not so simple. There are hundreds of variations in awakening and various states and levels of consciousness and mastery. You cannot make sense of it with any simplistic model or set of categories. Consciousness is a very fluid thing.

<p>
	Self-actualization is different from self-transcendence (enlightenment), yes. You can read more about that from Maslow.
</p>

<p>
	Self-actualization is the second highest stage. Self-transcendence is the highest.

The closer one gets to infinity the more "moral" one can be.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to hit infinity to make improvement.

<p>
	A human is more conscious than a cat. A cat is more conscious than an ant. An ant is more conscious than a plant. And Obama is more conscious than Trump.

<p>
	So clearly there's something amiss in your inner game. It's a mind thing. You need to become more conscious of what your mind is doing at the moment when you penetrate and go soft. What is your mind thinking? What is the fear? What are you visualizing? What are you feeling?
</p>

<p>
	Get very clear and honest about that.
</p>

<p>
	Sound like you might have fear of premature ejaculation or that you're putting so much pressure on yourself to perform in bed in a certain way. Good sex requires getting out of your head and into the feelings in your body. Try literally moving your awareness out of your head and out into your body.

<p>
	It feels exhausting to the ego-mind which wants to be biased in its love.
</p>

<p>
	To really do this the ego-mind needs to be broke down. This requires some serious enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind will NEVER be able to love conditionally. The solution is not to force the ego-mind to love but to transcend the ego-mind altogether.

<p>
	Of course!
</p>

<p>
	Because most Chinese from mainland China are stage Blue ethnocentric.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why they put Muslims in concentration camps over there.

<p>
	In America -- and in many other parts of the world -- there is an especially strong anti-black racial bias.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I hesitate to call my Mom a racist, but if I married a Chinese girl, she would be okay with it. But if I married a black girl, she would freak out.
</p>

<p>
	Racism is not equal across all the different minority groups. Some groups are treated more "white" and acceptable than others.
</p>

<p>
	Even in China they have flagrant racism against blacks.
</p>

<p>
	So this talk that, "Well, Asians have higher IQs than whites and Asians don't have it so bad in America" -- first, of all, it ignores the long history of anti-Asian racism in America which still exists to this day. But, secondly it naively ignores the fact that Asians were never slaves here and they don't have nearly the same stigma as blacks.
</p>

<p>
	I'm willing to bet that your average KKK member would be relatively okay with allowing Asians into this country, but very much against allowing Africans and Mexicans. You have to look at racism specifically against each minority group. Not just racism in the abstract. Few people are abstractly racist. They usually have a few races they especially don't like. Because racism is learned from one's culture and environmental survival conditions. And cultures are most racist against those races which affect the survival of that culture the most (Africans and Mexicans in America).
</p>

<p>
	That's the kicker:
</p>

<p>
	Your perspective is Absolute, because you are God.
</p>

<p>
	Perspective is an illusion. There is only the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	What you think of as "my perspective" is the ego-mind co-opting the Absolute. But there is no ego, there is no ego's perspective. There is just the Absolute which you have confused with "your life" because you are selfish.

<p>
	That cannot happen because all form is impermanent.

<p>

<p>
	The problem is that your use of the notion of "good" is a relative one. No two living organisms will agree on what good is because ego defines good as "that which improves my survival". So good is different for everyone. This is an existential problem.
</p>

<p>
	There is an Absolute Good, but it cannot be limited to any philosophy or any attachment to life or positive feeling.

<p>
	Of course the ego-mind is power-hungry for purposes of survival. That's why it tends to think and act absolutistically. Absolutism just comes naturally with any sort of attachment.

<p>
	That cannot possibly happen because all survival is relative.
</p>

<p>
	You're not appreciating the depth of this problem.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot EVER be such as thing as perfect goodness within the relative domain of form because perfect Goodness is only available to Infinite Consciousness, which is formless.
</p>

<p>
	If an organism could simply be programmed to act good, God would have already done that. God made organisms selfish precisely because it was necessary for their survival.

<p>
	Dude, chill out. Using the n-word will get you banned here.
</p>

<p>
	You seem to be way overcompensating for something.
</p>

<p>
	Racist is a valid concept -- within certain relativistic limits -- and serves a function in stopping racism -- which is a real phenomenon.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the label racist can be overused. But splitting hairs over the concept of racism just strikes me as gratuitous.
</p>

<p>
	There are plenty of legit racists in the world, and calling them out on it is fair.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Bingo! That's it. It's as simple as that.
</p>

<p>
	It's even reflected in your username.
</p>

<p>
	You will have to do deep inner work to heal, forgive, and release that trauma. Then you will be able to be more intimate with men.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a problem of lack of sexual skill. It's an inner game problem due to your molestation.
</p>

<p>
	Your best bet is working with a spiritual healer/coach to release your trauma, rather than watching sex technique videos.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is not about mechanical technique. It's about your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you can't cum is because you were molested and now you're not able to fully surrender to the man. You probably have a deep fear of intimacy and vulnerability because you had to put up emotional armor to protect yourself against the hurt and shame of being molested by a family member.

			I read the following description of sexual frustration by a guy with a very high sex drive on reddit. I assumed that it was similar for you. I always thought that a guy sex drive could be evaluated by the number of time he can cum in a day. I guess it's more nuanced than that.

		<p>
			"Never-ending feeling of being horny. Talking from when I wake up, to when I go to bed, with the most intense times being right after I wake up and again before I fall asleep (being in a bed maybe?). It's a constant nagging sensation that just will not go away. Anything will make me horny. A look from a pretty girl, a bit of skin, really anything involving a nice-looking girl and I'm rock hard. It's subsided a bit as I move into my later-20s, but when I was younger I would get hard all the time over virtually nothing. A look, a laugh, a bra strap. Anything. It's a never-ending sensation of biological deprivation, a thirst you can't quench. And it can fuck with your head after a while.
		</p>

<p>
	I've never had a constant insatiable horniness like this guy is describing.
</p>

<p>
	I'm regularly horny, but I can also please myself and get on with work or whatever. If I want to, I can focus on work for a week at a time and forget all about sex.
</p>

<p>
	I get most horny during solo meditation retreats.

<p>
	Yes, if you push him on it, as a philosophical level he will acknowledge relativity. But then he will go back to calling half the country fascist.
</p>

<p>
	It's an interesting dynamic.
</p>

<p>
	Relativity is an extremely deep topic. It can be realized at mild levels or at extremely deep levels, or anything in between. Mostly people's understanding and appreciation of relativity is skin deep and purely theoretical.

<p>

<p>
	This is not the real Middle East. This is the rich kids from the Middle East. The cream of the crop. You gotta go to the rural parts of the Middle East to really see the depth of the problem. You gotta go to the Mississippi of the Middle East. It won't be Blue/Orange.

<p>
	Most guys are really turned on my femininity. So anything you can do to amp up your expression of femininity will drive them nuts. Just by acting up your femininity in bed this will make the sex 10x hotter. Acting up femininity is stuff like sweet talk, gentleness, moaning, squirming, going into heat, being submissive, etc.

	You just need to find the right guy and get turned on in the right ways.

<p>
	You can have a deep vaginal orgasm without even any physical touch.

<p>
	Hell, I can almost have a vaginal orgasm and I'm a dude.

<p>
	Russell Brand isn't a skill. It's his natural disposition. He's off-the-charts extroverted and charismatic. An introverted guy is never going to be able match that.

<p>
	My analysis is mostly looking at the Spiral development level of the people in that region.

<p>
	There is no way in hell a stage Purple/Red, highly tribal people, would be able to sustain some peaceful democracy regardless of outside influences. The entire region is too underdeveloped right now for peaceful coexistence.

<p>
	Sam has a lot of experience and wisdom when it comes to politics.
</p>

<p>
	What I admire about him is his no-nonsense groundedness. If you ignore the fun half of the show, then you can clearly see Sam's expertise and wisdom. But people like to skip the serious first half of the show to get to the fun half -- where, yeah -- he makes a lot of fun of people. It's fun but shallow. But it draws people in to the serious half.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with overly young pundits is that they simply lack the maturity and experience and wisdom. People in their 20's and 30's are simply too immature to do solid, grounded political analysis. They are still too utopian.
</p>

<p>
	Guys like Vaush, Kyle, etc. are still too young, too edgy, too immature, etc. They need to ripen into their 40's and 50's to really get good I think.
</p>

			The US played a major role in the long term destabilization of the region.  The US overthrew a democratically elected leader in Iran during the 1953 Iranian coup and installed an American friendly dictator who then signed a large fraction of Iranian oil fields over the Americans.  That planted the beginnings of the now well known hatred west, which festered for 25 years until it lead to civil war where the American installed Shah was overthrown by a theocratic regime. It's interesting because the country was generally fairly prosperous and in fact was largely being westernized in the 20 years after the 1953 Coup.  In this case, a CIA coup, worked to create a sort of Islamic conservative backlash which led to the Iranian Revolution 25 years later.  
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	All that is the case.
</p>

<p>
	But, I still think that Iran would have had a conservative backlash regardless. There is no way that Iran would have been able to sustain some thriving liberal socialist democracy. It's not developed enough for that. There is still way too much religious fundamentalism there, and the US is the not the cause of that.
</p>

<p>
	The US is merely exploiting such things for its own gain. Like a hyena picking at a crippled animal. The hyena did not take down the animal. The animal broke its own leg. Of course this does not excuse the US's exploitative behavior.
</p>

<p>
	And if the US has not taken out Saddam, he and Iran would still be at each others throats.
</p>

<p>
	It's really hard to say whether taking out Saddam was a net positive or negative in the very long run. In the short run it was bad.

	The whole region is tribal as fuck. Even folk of the same Shia sect won't get along. It's deeply tribal, which requires autocratic unification through oppression and genocide.

			The problem with this kind of categorization is that it is very black and white. It assumes that the human psyche is not a paradox of two opposing forces but either or. Thanks to Wilber and Graves and the others we know that that's out of date. Modern understanding is more of a spectrum and it's way more accurate and better at solving such problems.

			No one is a 100% narcissist. At the core of every narcissistic psyche there is deep empathy. That empathy can be revived and brought back to balance with the narcissistic trait through understanding and therapy.

<p>
	This is an important point. I agree with this.
</p>

<p>
	The human psyche is far too complex to simply fall into 4 categories like: "sociopath", "psychopath", "narcissist", and "normie". It's a complex blend of thousands of variables which no psychologist fully understands.
</p>

<p>
	Yet still, some people are just straight up flaming narcissists.
</p>

<p>
	My Dad was a pretty serious narcissist/sociopath.

			One time, I tested how far she would go. We had an issue that we both were contributing to and she wanted to place 100% of the blame on me. I said I was willing to take 90% responsibility for our problem and I spent several minutes explaining how I contributed to the problem and how I need to improve. I then asked if she would take 10% and look at herself. She refused. I then said I would take 99.9% responsibility as being at fault for all the problems we’ve ever had in the relationship. I asked if there was even ONE thing she had ever done that may have contributed to any problem we had and she gave a firm “No”.

<p>
	It's important, but the cost of Arabs selling so much oil is that Americans will interfere with their affairs. You can't have one without the other.
</p>

<p>
	So it's not proper to say, "Well, if only the West didn't interfere with the Arabs they would be thriving democracies." No they wouldn't. They would be ruthless monarchs living in the middle ages. The West has accelerated Middle Eastern development despite the obvious exploitation. The West has also accelerated the East's development despite the obvious exploitation.

	"Monkey see, monkey do."
</p>

<p>
	And...
</p>

<p>
	"Steal like an artist."
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Intimation is natural. It's how humans learn. The secret is to steal like an artist. By which is meant: intimate from dozens and even hundreds of obscure sources until you develop a style of your own.
</p>

<p>
	Intimation is only bad when you imitate the most obvious mainstream stuff. This is just creative laziness.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I imitate self-help professionals, but I will never imitate Tony Robbins or Eckhart Tolle, because they are too obvious. I imitate people no one knows about. And I imitate dozens of them. This way my creative gene pool is diverse rather than inbred.
