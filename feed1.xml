<p>
	That's true, except you can manipulate the BitCoin supply and market extremely easily, which happens all the time, making BitCoin so volitile it is basically unusable as actual currency. And there are 100s of competing crypto currencies and you have no clue which one will end up on top in the end and which ones will become worthless.
</p>

<p>
	BitCoin's privacy features have virtually evaporated now since all exchanges require ID verification and are monitored by the feds.
</p>

<p>
	One of the most important fratures of a currency is to be stable, which crypto is not.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No.
</p>

<p>
	Think deeper about what money means.
</p>

<p>
	To hold a $1 million dollars means that you can not work for several years while others serve you.
</p>

<p>
	That is wage slavery. The slavery is baked directly into the dollars. The only reason a million dollars seems like a lot is because it means a dozen people are forced to serve you.
</p>

<p>
	If wage slavery didn't exist your million dollars would not be worth so much.

<p>
	There is nothing special about anyone. Or, to say the same thing, everyone is equally special.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is bullshitting itself whenever it feels that one thing is more special than any other. That is ego in a nutshell. But you can't stop doing it or you'll die. So here we are, bullshitting each other.
</p>

<p>
	And now you understand all of human life, especially dating and relationships. It's all 100% pure bullshit which is why it's so unstable.

			Wasn't arranged marriage the norm since ever until very recently? Humanity were mostly tribes, if you tried to pick up a girl from another tribe they would cut your dick off. That is why most men are afraid of pickup I think. <img alt=":ph34r:" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ph34r.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ph34r@2x.png 2x" title=":ph34r:" width="20" />

	Players have been around since forever.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to go to another tribe to pick up girls. Although of course that happened too.
</p>

<p>
	You know the first thing that Magellan's men did after they landed on foreign shores in South America after weeks at sea? Go pick up the native chicks. To put that into perspective, that's like astronauts landing on Mars and the first thing they do is go looking for alien girls to fuck.

<p>
	When women get turned on by male stripper shows, it's not just the body. It's the emotional state the entire show puts her in. When girls go to male strip shows it's usually a pack of girls and they all drink and dance and get have fun together. This pumps up their state and then they get horny from that and want dick.
</p>

<p>
	Pumping up her emotional state is the magic key. No woman will ever fuck you logically. If you cannot get her out of logic-mode, she will say No.

<p>
	It's cringe in your eyes right now because you're in a cold and logical state.

	The dick pic can work as long as you already got her really turned on emotionally.

<p>

			However, I am now starting to think maybe women in general are not turned on sexually to any significant degree by any male visual aesthetics. Sometimes I wonder if there was even any point in me working so hard to look fit and masculine. Do women even masturbate to guys who look hot to them?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Haha
</p>

<p>
	Women are not sexually aroused in the same way as guys. They are not aroused by visuals alone. They are attracted to powerful personality and presence and leadership. They are attracted when the guy is good at pumping up her emotional state and making her feel like a girl. Women are emotional creatures. A photo of the biggest dick in the world will not make her excited. You must pump up her emotional state first. The silent James Bond approach will not get you laid. You must be chatty, playful, and extroverted. You need to play with her.
</p>

<p>
	Your looks are a great advantage -- they get your foot in the door -- but getting your foot in the door is NOT closing. Learning to close makes or breaks your whole lay count. If you are good-looking but have no clue how to close, you'll get laid less then ugly guys who know how to close.
</p>

<p>
	Right now it's like you own a Ferrari but have no clue how to drive. The Ferrari is a fast car that will beat a Toyota, but if I know how to drive my Toyota and you have no clue how to drive your Ferrari, I will beat you every time.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to understand what turns on women, go to Walmart and buy a romance novel. Read it. That's is porn for women. Women are turned on mentally, not visually.
</p>

<p>
	Also... attraction is also not seduction. You can get attraction pretty easy but then you must lay on the seduction until she's horny. A women does not get horny instantly like a guy. You need to guide her into it and manage all the logistics so sex can happen. You absolutely cannot count on women to handle the logistics. Learning to handle logistics like a champ is the #1 key to getting laid consistently.
</p>

<p>
	It's the logistics, stupid <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	All game boils down to two things: playful leading. Everything else is an unpacking of those two things. If you can't be playful and you can't lead, your game sucks, and so your chances of getting laid become extremely low.
</p>

	Once Trump is out of office for 90 days, and he's nowhere to be seen on social media, the Republicans <strong><u>might</u></strong> muster enough spine to convict him as the cost of doing so becomes negligible.
</p>

<p>
	No matter what, the Republicans are going to be forced to move forward without Trump. There is no way Trump will run and win again. So they need a new survival strategy.

<p>
	Even when the gov is controlled by Republicans, we still have regulations in place at the federal level against racism, hate speech, terrorist conspiracies, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Once the government's policies on policing online platforms are voted upon and set it place, they will be more strict than what we have now, where Twitter, Facebook, and YT are pretty lax with enforcement because they don't want to be labeled censors.
</p>

<p>
	Once online norms are established at the federal level, democratically, there will be much less squeamishness in enforcing them. The problem right now for these platforms is that they have no democratically established rules to rely on. So they must make up their own rules which don't have universal buy-in. This will change in the future.
</p>

<p>
	We explained this long ago:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/true-vs-false-skepticism" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/articles/true-vs-false-skepticism</a>
</p>

<p>
	Make the distinction between skepticism directed inwardly vs skepticism weaponized outwardly.
</p>

<p>
	Conspiracy theories are skepticism weaponized outwardly in order to avoid inward skepticism. See the trick?
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.actualized.org/articles/distraction" rel="external">https://www.actualized.org/articles/distraction</a>
</p>

<p>
	It's dead simple, but very sneaky until you're told the trick.

<title>Trump permanently suspended from Twitter</title>

<p>
	Here's the problem for right-wingers. If Big Tech is regulated by government -- which I am all for -- Trump and his racist MAGA douches would still get banned. Even faster actually. Government has laws against racism.
</p>

<p>
	If Twitter was properly regulated by government, Trump would have been banned years ago. With government regulation, platform ToS will become more strict and will be more strictly enforced. Which is bad news for devils, of which the right-wing is full.
</p>

<p>
	When the right wing cries about free speech and censorship what they're really crying about is not being able to continue their devilry unobstructed. Nice try, but we see through your bullshit.

This is an online social space, not an academic journal. People come here to socialize.
</p>

<p>
	Chill out and don't take social spaces so seriously. They will never live up to your pedantic standards.
</p>

<p>
	This is so obvious I shouldn't even have to say it. But apparently some folks here need it said.
</p>

<p>
	And if you think this place is like Twitter, you haven't spent much time on Twitter.

<p>
	It's parasitic because traders don't do any actual creative work, they leech off the labor of others in order to make easy money that would otherwise be impossible to make through creative labor.
</p>

<p>
	See, when you take $1000 and turn it into $1,000,000 via BitCoin, you've just figured out how to turn a few teachers, farmers, and retail clerks into your wages slaves. That is literally what you are doing, but you've masked it as something else so you can sleep well at night.
</p>

<p>
	That's the evil genius of Wall Street as a system. It gives legitimacy to professional thieves and parasites and allows them to sleep well at night as they pat each other on the back.
</p>

<p>
	Thievery in the 21st century has gotten so advanced and sophisticated that even the thieves who spend their entire lives doing it have no awareness that they are in fact thieves -- giving them perfect plausible deniability.

			It reminds me of watching livestreams of the biggest BLM rally in Portland. There were tens of thousands of protestors and hundreds of heavily armored feds to protect the federal building. Everyone knew that if the protestors pull down the fence, there would be a massive fed/police response and many people would be injured in the conflict. The majority of people on the livestream came to see a confrontation and got annoyed watching protestors merely shake the fence and throw minor fireworks into the courtyard. The chat was filled with comments like "This is boring!!", "How much longer do we have to wait?", "I want to see some action! Tear down the fence! Let's goooo!".

<p>
	I must admit, when I was watching the MAGA mob on Jan 6th, I was eager to see more violence.
</p>

<p>
	Who can resist such drama?
</p>

<p>
	That's part of Trump's whole effect on us. He's sells drama, drama, drama.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing missing from the insurrection mob were girls with big tits in American flag bikinis cheering in the background <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" /> How can anyone compete with that for ratings?

<p>
	You see the problem here? If people are only interested in politics when it's at a train wreck stage of crises, then that's how our politics will be. The ego is bored with reasonable politics hence we get the drama-politics which the ego loves.
</p>

<p>
	Is it an accident that Game Of Thrones is the most popular TV show of all time? Or is that because that's the kind of politics the majority of us crave?
</p>

<p>
	Conscious politics is boring. It doesn't sell tickets.

	Are you kidding? These people have little to lose. Their lives suck as it is and they are itching for battle. These militia groups have been training and buying up guns for this opportunity for years. They want a civil war to give themselves a sense of purpose.

	Now the stage Red warrior people will crawl out of the woodwork. These people will be motivated like sharks sensing blood in the water. Their eyes will glow with giddiness for battle in service of a righteous cause.

<p>
	When the German Nazis were defeated, the only way to heal that was for everyone in Germany to recognize and acknowledge that Nazism was wrong and toxic.

	I don't see that happening. The Republicans are completely spineless and at least half of them have drunk the Kool-Aid. It's clear now that their responses will be as tepid as possible for them to get away with. They will do as little as humanly possible to keep their jobs.

<p>
	We are going through a stage Orange >> Green transition. But right-wingers don't understand this transition, they demonize Green and refuse to change their ways. Which necessitates that they create their own toxic alternative-reality bubble. The more they try to deny the validity of Green, the more delusional and ideological their worldview must get. And they must blame someone for all this other than themselves. So of course they project their delusion onto Green.
</p>

<p>
	An entire media industry has been built over the last 5 years for the demonization and scapegoating of Green to cater to the insecurities and paranoia of the right. This industry is extremely profitable so it's not going away any time soon, yet it needs to be discredited and dismantled because it sows paranoia and delusion across tens of millions of people.

<p>
	The problem for radicalized Republicans now is that they are so wrong that it's too painful for their egos to admit it.
</p>

<p>
	There needs to be an admission by Republicans that Republicans were deeply wrong about Trump. But that is too painful for them to do. So they double-down with denial and scapegoating the left. In their minds they think the left is the problem, but it's them that's the problem and they need to acknowledge that publicly. But that's the last thing they will ever do.

	Malcolm Nance is a former CIA counter-terrorist agent. He has really good, sober and stark analysis of such issues:

	I hope I am wrong. But better safe than left with our pants down like last time. The MAGA people are crazy enough to try to stage a full-blown coup or simply lash out in vengance and rage. Assassination attempts likely.

	Also don't forget that the IRS now expect a cut of all your Bitcoin profits. So don't get yourself caught not paying tax. They are tracking you.
</p>

<p>
	After this huge bull run IRS will be cracking down on all the cheaters.

<p>
	The problem with BitCoin is that it attracts the lowest scum on the planet like flies on shit. That is the company you've chosen to keep.

<p>
	Absolutely.
</p>

<p>
	But you also have to consider: Green hippies and SJWs are not suitable for serving in a SWAT team. Law enforcement people must be hardened people given the animals they deal with on a regular basis. Law enforcement's job is largely to deal with stage Red -- who tend to be ruthless nutjobs.
</p>

<p>
	It is foolish to hold law enforcement types to the same standards as Echkart Tolle. When you tell a law enforcement type to be an Eckhart Tolle type, that's like feeding your dog tofu.

<p>
	To create massive value you must develop yourself and build the necessary knowledge, expertise, wisdom, and skills.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you make some easy cash fast does not mean you have a clue as to how to use it to create massive value. In fact there will be an inverse relationship there because if you were serious about creating massive value you would not be chasing easy money in the first place.

<p>
	I'm not saying don't invest your money. But recognize the difference between prudent investing vs gambling and hoping to get rich for nothing.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is that nobody knows the real value of crypto. So you're just gambling. Just because you get lucky does not make it not gambling. Be careful not to fool yourself that you know things which you don't really know.
</p>

<p>
	It's very easy to fool yourself with investing, especially when you're chasing some craze like crypto. You buy into social media hype and get so excited you stop thinking straight.

	This situation is so nuts that MAGA is now even turning on Brietbart and calling it fake news for censoring them and not telling them what they want to hear. Read the comments here of MAGA turning on Brietbart for not being right-wing enough for them! Lol
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/01/11/mike-pence-and-donald-trump-patch-up-relationship-in-white-house-meeting/#disqus_thread" rel="external nofollow">https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2021/01/11/mike-pence-and-donald-trump-patch-up-relationship-in-white-house-meeting/#disqus_thread</a>
</p>

<p>
	This is truly going off the rails. Even the far right-wing media leaders will soon lose control of this MAGA movement as it devolves into pure rage and insanity.
</p>

<p>
	When you tell these MAGA any fact that contradicts their narrow paranoid worldview, they just interpret it as you being part of the globalist conspiracy against them.
</p>

<p>
	At this point these MAGA are too nuts for even FoxNews. They have created a Frankenstein and now he has broken loose and turned on his master.

	I don't understand how it's hard for people to understand that the police are not a monolith. Out of 500 police, yeah, 20 might be sympathetic to MAGA. This is not a condemnation of the police. It's just a natural statistical outcome. The police are not fucking Rococop (and even Robocop had emotional conflicts of interest). They are real humans with emotions, egos, beliefs, religions, ideologies, biases, blindspots, weaknesses, etc. This is not an error. It just requires professionalism and oversight to manage.
</p>

<p>
	Remember, in the end, we are policing ourselves. No magical gods nor droid army is policing us.

<p>
	It's obvious that when the center of gravity of a society is, let's say Blue/Orange, there will be a natural bias to increase security for threats coming from enemies who are from stage Green vs from stage Blue/Orange. Just like you would have more security against strangers at your home vs family members even through the strangers could be nice people while your family members could be psychopaths who want to murder you.
</p>

<p>
	It's always harder to defend against a threat which is closest to you. Which is why it's virtually impossible to defense against the corruption of your own mind, because it is so close to you that it's you.
</p>

<p>
	How do you defend against the devil when you are him? <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	A floor lamp illuminates the whole room except the very floor it's standing on. That's the natural blindspot.
</p>

<p>
	You should note that dynamic this will also occur with stage Green. Progressives will also make this mistake and have a blindspot towards leftist violence. For example, if a crowd of rabid socialists stormed the Capitol to start a socialist revolution against capitalism, progressives in the media would be much more sympathetic to their violence than they are to right-wing violence. Nothing surprising here. It's not racism. It's deeper than that. We saw this with the BLM riots in the summer. Stage Green is much more understanding of leftist violence and will make excuses for it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, leftist violence is possible, although it is less likely. The left is generally more conscious, but they are still deeply unconscious and they are not beyond the possibility of some kind of revolutionary movement once they get pissed off enough about the evils of capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	It's extremely easy to denounce and demonize the other side when it goes too far. What's really hard is to denounce your side when it goes too far.

	But I am not really interested in going mainstream because what I teach will never be mainstream. And the core of my work is serious epistemology.
</p>

<p>
	I don't do the practical stuff to be more popular, I do it because I know it's needed to help people burn through their karma to maybe one day understand my serious epistemic work.

			Remarkably bad take by Sam Harris, who to his credit does at least understand the gravity of Trump's coup attempt and recognize the danger that Trump poses, while at the same time using Trump's coup as an opportunity to demonize the Left, and to deny the possibility of White Supremacist sympathies with the negligent way that the Capitol Hill Police weren't prepared for the quite obvious threat of violence from MAGA supporters.
		</p>

		<p>
			He seems to think that Black Police Officers being on scene discredits the entire notion of possible White Supremacist ties in the Capitol Hill Police; doesn't even cross his mind that the Higher Ups could have left the people defending the Capitol building out to dry, or that racism in institutions can be compartmentalized. He just kind of shrugs of thr dysfunction of the Capitol Hill Police as a mystery, and leaves it at that.

<p>
	I think Sam's analysis here is very good overall.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, he did leave out the factor that the management of the Capitol Police may have had some nationalistic biases or even explicit instructions from the Trump admin.
</p>

<p>
	But overall I agree with Sam. I would not call the Capitol Police racist. The simple explanation is that they were outnumbered and caught off-guard. A few of them, individually, were likely sympathetic to the MAGA agenda, but those few are not the majority. The majority of police are professionals, not racists. And systemic racial biases should not blamed on all individual cops.

<p>
	It stings like a bitch for a week. You feel it and go on with life. It helps a lot when you have built a good life for yourself centered around a life purpose and personal dev. Otherwise you will wallow in despair and depression because you got nothing else going for you.
</p>

<p>
	When you are proactive about building a good life for yourself and doing spiritual work, you need other people less and less to complete you. To the extent that your life is not well put together, the loss of people in your life will lead to huge catastrophe and deep suffering -- because you use these people as emotional crutches to avoid doing serious work. If you take this work deep enough, you will not need anyone for your happiness.

<p>
	Yes, but I see progressive YTers blur that line frequently, calling all police racists or white supremicists. That's not a good look for the progressive left. It alienates good police officers and forces them to side with MAGA dumbasses who at least don't call them racist (which is actually more accurate).
</p>

<p>
	Progressives need to be allies of the police so the police isn't sympathetic to fascists. We want the police on our side because the police is directly involved with social justice.

<p>
	1) Don't date humorless people
</p>

<p>
	2) Your jokes and teasing has to be well-calibrated. There is a fine line between a tease and an insult. Telling a girl that her cooking sucks is a dumb move. You don't want to be serious in that way. And don't tease her on their weight. Girls are extremely sensitive about their weight and you will nuke the whole interaction that way. And don't make vulgar sexual jokes either.

			Kinda sounds like traffic violations. The vast majority of traffic violations are minor and the police officer settles it there by writing a ticket. Yet the person can plead their case in court if they want. Other traffic violations are more serious - like hit and run - in which the court must get involved. And some traffic violations, like sex trafficking are so serious that the FBI and CIA may get involved.

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	What's cool is that all the problems that exist in the online world, we've already developed systems for handling them in the offline world. It's just a matter of seeing the connection between the two worlds. People tend to treat the online world as "unreal". But it's not less real or significant than the offline world. Hence policing is necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Just like the wild west days are over in the offline world, the wild west days are coming to an end in the online world.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, all of this is just paving the way for fully-immersive online worlds. Not just video games, but life inside a virtual world. Imagine what devilry will lurk there and how much policing will be needed.

<p>
	Again, the police are not white supremacist, but many of them have ethnocentric dispositions and egos.
</p>

<p>
	Calling the police white supremacist or racists misses the deeper point for a shallow understanding of the issue. Demonizing the police is not a good strategy because the police are what stand in the way between you and serious devils who would beat you to death with an American flag pole.

<p>
	Well, each of these companies will still need to devote massive manpower to policing their platforms.
</p>

<p>
	Just like in the off-line world, there are the police and there is the court system. These are distinct things and for every one judge there are 100 police officers out there arresting and ticketing people.
</p>

<p>
	So Apple will still need to have 1000s of online police-officer equivalents who then send cases to some government online court.

		<p>
			however, I'm just proposing this: looking at the link that <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/20019-jodistrict/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="20019" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/20019-jodistrict/" rel="">@Jodistrict</a> provided, aren't some of these group portraying a world view and a value system of blood thirsty natzis? I'm saying this in complete concern over what they might do, or what can happen in the coming days, and not soley to demean them. 
		</p>

		<p>
			it's fucking concerning to me to see this many people waring and carrying flags and symbols so alarmingly resembling that of natzi Germany. I don't think it's common sense not to call them by their name. not to say we should be scared of them, but just to be clear what they really stand for.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A) It will surprise you, but most Nazis are not blood-thristy people. They are good, ordinary, hard-working people who just happen to follow the herd and identify with their ethnicity, riled up by a fascist demagogue. They are slowly radicalized in the same way Islamic extremists are radicalized.
</p>

<p>
	B) Nazism is just an extreme form of stage Blue ethnocentrism.
</p>

<p>
	C) Every Spiral stage is very broad and can have healthy and toxic manifestations. There are many positive manifestations of stage Blue, and even ethnocentrism, but there are also extremely toxic ones. The problem is not stage Blue per se, it's toxic stage Blue riled up by demagogues, grifters, and devils like the Trump family and FoxNews.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that approx 50% of the global population is at stage Blue ethnocentric level of ego development. Therefore half the global population is susceptible to Nazi-like ideologies if they are allowed to flourish. The key is that those of us who are more developed and more conscious must steer them away from such extremes and show them a path toward healthy manifestations of Blue and beyond. Republican leadership has failed at this job by playing into conspiracy theories and not standing up against Trump's depraved behavior from day one.
</p>

<p>
	Few MAGA supporters are actually Nazis. So characterizing them as such will just make you look partisan. It's important now, more than ever, to be as precise as possible with our terminology and casting of other people -- to avoid demonization, scapegoating, and misunderstanding the nature of the beast. The more accurately we understand the problem, the better we can deal with it.
</p>

<p>
	Of course both types of responsibility are crucial and one cannot be offloaded onto the other.

<p>
	It's just classic nationalism and ethnocentrism.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue is ethnocentric. They defend whatever ethnic identity they have, regardless of whether it's Hindus, Germans, Russians, Chinese, Japanese, or Muricans.
</p>

<p>
	This is Murican ethnocentrism. Trump's entire appeal for the last 5 years has been American ethnocentrism. That's his entire platform, and ethnocentrically-inclined people lap it up. They love it because nobody else speaks to them in that way.
</p>

<p>
	To call it racism doesn't fully get the point. It's ethnocentrism. Which of course leads to racism in practice. Ethnocentrism is where racism spawns from.

<p>
	The solution to Silicon Valley overlords is for Congress to establish a legal process for designing ToS for major online platforms and to set up a special court within the existing legal system for handling online platform ToS violations, disputes, and appeals.
</p>

<p>
	We simply need a new branch of the court for handling online violations. And we need a democratic process for setting and adjusting ToS for major platforms across the internet.
</p>

<p>
	But of course, right-wingers don't really want this because in the end they will still get deplatformed due to violating the democratically selected ToS because no democratically select ToS will tolerate right-wing MAGA hatred, racism, conspiracy theories, and calls for violence.
</p>

<p>
	What right-wingers really want is the freedom to create an ideological echochamber for their delusions to go unchallenged by facts or reality. And that will never happen under a democratic system because it is toxic and dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	The problems with online platforms could be easily solved through good governance and regulations. But of course right-wingers hate government, so they will not support any such thing. Therein lies the stupidity of libertarianism.

<p>
	No, he's Orange.

<p>
	His book is helping people go from Blue to Orange. It's classic capitalist business/financial advice. It has nothing to do with Yellow or systemic concerns about "wage slavery" as a political or social ailment. He's just telling people how to make lots of money.

<p>
	I used to be more Orange. I've evolved a lot in 8 years.
</p>

<p>
	Some topics I still cover from an Orange perspective because all the higher stages include the lower stage capacities within them.
</p>

<p>
	When you become Yellow, you still have full access to the Orange abilities. If the topic I'm talking about is something like teaching incels how to get laid, then I will use a stage Orange approach because they do not need nor relate to Yellow. I am able to communicate from any color of the Spiral depending on what is appropriate to the situation. I'm not limited to operating from one color.

	If you want to understand just how deranged the MAGA crowd is, head on over to Brietbart, click on any random article, and read the comments section.

<p>
	Warning: not for the feint of heart.

<p>
	Love is the wormhole to God, since God is Love.
</p>

<p>
	Replace your fear with Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love truth, reality, and consciousness so much that you forget all about fear of nothingness or death.
</p>

<p>
	That is the way.

<p>
	Those bad apples need to be purged otherwise their corruption infects the entire batch.
</p>

<p>
	That's the key insight you're missing here.
</p>

<p>
	You want a platform that does not remove bad apples. Which will never happen because of how dangerous that is. Which is why all online platforms require moderation and TOS. What you want is called anarchy. Well, don't be surprised when others don't want anarchy. It isn't fun.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Women love to play coy and give fake resistance. Or sometimes she's just not comfortable and shy.
</p>

<p>
	The man has to be persistent and break through her coy displays and make her feel comfortable.
</p>

<p>
	If a woman resists your kiss, you butter her up with playfulness and wit, boost up her mood, and they try again 5 mins later when she's giggling. Never kiss a woman on a down-note. Kiss her on an up-note. Tickle her first, then kiss her.
</p>

<p>
	Women are highly state and mood dependent. By learning to shift her mood you get her to open to you. Women are not like men. They need to be warmed up and turned on. And they will play coy.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all this assumes she's interested in you. I'm not talking about raping a stranger while she protests. I'm talking about flirtation.
</p>

<p>
	The hotter the woman is, the more she will shit-test you before she lets you kiss her and fuck her. Women need to test how seriously committed you are to them. This is part of her survival strategy. She wants a persistent man who knows what he wants and can cut through her token defenses.
</p>

<p>
	One of the best tricks you can play on a woman is telling her this: "We are definitely not having sex tonight." Because that's usually her line. Then you have sex with her 10 minutes later. When she gives you the surprised Pikachu face, you tell her you were just kidding.
</p>

<p>
	You have to stop being serious with women. Play with them without abusing them.
</p>

<p>
	Push-pull is an important dynamic to learn. Stuff like telling her, "I hate you." and then kissing her. You need to be illogical to scramble her defenses.
</p>

<p>
	Self-image and identity is a mental construction.
</p>

<p>
	Having a dick does not actually give you a male self-image or identity. You must construct that.
</p>

<p>
	Nowhere in the universe is it writ that having a dick = being male. You make that up. Being "male" is actually a fantasy. You are role playing. You could also role play as a space kangaroo.

<p>
	There are far more aspects of being a he or she than physical dominance within athletics.
</p>

<p>
	If Mike Tyson wants to cut off his dick and become a she in self-identitication, that is her business and maybe it will make her feel better about herself. But box with girls Ms Tyson should not.

<p>
	Let's not derail this thread with a complex debate about transgender. You can start a separate thread for that.
</p>

<p>
	The only point I care to make here is that Rogan is not a transphobe.

<p>
	To a degree. But it still won't be fair to biological women. You are not going to entirely reverse a lifetime of biological manhood by taking some chemicals. Take height, for example. Men are taller than women on average, and no chemicals will reverse that. And it won't end there.

<p>
	That was said in the context of talking about competition in sports. Rogan was correct, despite his crass language.
</p>

<p>
	Equating Rogan with a racist or transphobe is silly. This is a mistake made by over-eager SJWs. Rogan is not transphobic.
</p>

<p>
	If you cut off Mike Tyson's dick that does not mean you can put "her" in a boxing ring with biological women. When it comes to boxing, "she" will still be effectively a "man".

	I find Joe Rogan's take on trans people overblown. He does not hate trans people, he just doesn't want trans people competing in non-trans sports. And I agree with him on that. A person born a man should not be allowed to compete in women's sports -- for obvious reasons.

<p>
	Haha
</p>

<p>
	That's so unnecessary. Of course you could do that. Or you could just square up to her, look deep in her eyes, move your face closer to her's, hold her hands in yours -- and you will see it in her eyes if she wants you to kiss her. If she is giving you puppy-dog eyes, you kiss her. If she flinches or recoils or darts her eyes as you move your face slowly towards her, you pull back. And if she allows you to stroke her face or the hair on her face slowly with your fingers, then she'll definitely let you kiss her.
</p>

<p>
	And if you go in for the kiss and she pulls away, you just laugh it off and try again 5 minutes later.
</p>

<p>
	Always assume the kiss will be successful unless she explicitly says No. If she agreed to go on a date with you, she's obviously already willing to fuck you. All you gotta do is not act weird or creepy and make her feel comfortable. You do this through lots of early physical escalation. Google Kino Escalation Ladder.

<p>
	I've seen him game in-person.
</p>

<p>
	He definitely gets results, but he is a dysfunctional, sociopathic rapist and so I cannot recommend him. He also games a lot while drunk. And the thing is, if you drink every night, you don't need game techniques. Being drunk IS the technique.
</p>

<p>
	I'm sure you can learn valuable things from him, but I cannot in good conscience endorse his methods because they are sociopathic.

<p>
	Yes, Elon Musk, please give us a platform where hate speech, racism, xenophobia, slander, lies, and outlandish conspiracy theories are allowed to flourish unchecked.
</p>

<p>
	Right-wing logic.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental problem that the right-wing has is that their worldview is untenable, therefore they need a custom, closed ecosystem where they can inbreed with their own kind and escape facts en mass through self-validating circle-jerking.
</p>

<p>
	Far right ideas can only survive inside a reality-denying echo-chamber.
</p>

<p>
	Don't like the facts? No problem, just invent your own and gather a million like-minded people so that no one you talk to tells you otherwise.
</p>

		<p>
			I see your point. However,I am thinking Jordan has publicly denounced that he sides with Nazi. I imagine he would take offence that someone claims he sides with Nazis given his background and study.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	My point was far more subtle than calling JP a Nazi. He is not a Nazi and he will speak out against explicit Nazi ideas.
</p>

<p>
	HOWEVER! -- His political ranting against SJWs and Cultural Marxists is part of an alt-right media echo-chamber that radicalizes millions of people. His ideas are the entry point to the MAGA rabbit hole via social media.
</p>

<p>
	This brainwashing of the population by right-wingers is very sneaky and subtle stuff. It is never explicit, and yet these media figures must all be held publicly accountable for the toxic ideologies they ease unsuspecting political noobs into:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Charlie Kirk
	</li>
	<li>
		Joe Rogan
	</li>
	<li>
		Ben Shapiro
	</li>
	<li>
		Dave Rubin
	</li>
	<li>
		Jordan Peterson
	</li>
	<li>
		Tim Pool
	</li>
	<li>
		Steven Crowder
	</li>
	<li>
		Mike Cernovich
	</li>
	<li>
		Dennis Prager
	</li>
	<li>
		Alex Jones
	</li>
	<li>
		Stefan Molyneux
	</li>
	<li>
		Tucker Carlson
	</li>
	<li>
		Laura Ingraham
	</li>
	<li>
		Sean Hannity
	</li>
	<li>
		Lou Dobbs
	</li>
	<li>
		Jeanine Pirro
	</li>
	<li>
		Rush Limbaugh
	</li>
	<li>
		Mark Levin
	</li>
	<li>
		Fox & Friends
	</li>
	<li>
		Candice Owens
	</li>
	<li>
		Kaitlin Bennett
	</li>
	<li>
		Dinesh D'Souza
	</li>
	<li>
		Breitbart News
	</li>
	<li>
		FoxNews
	</li>
	<li>
		OANN
	</li>
	<li>
		NewsMax
	</li>
	<li>
		Sinclair Broadcasting
	</li>
	<li>
		The Koch brothers
	</li>
	<li>
		The Mercers
	</li>
	<li>
		And entire Trump family
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	All of the above constitutes a subtle but highly toxic brainwashing funnel.
</p>

<p>
	The whole problem with indoctrination is that it's never explicit. Even the people doing it (the people above) do not know they are doing it. If they were conscious of what they were doing, they would stop doing it.
</p>

<p>
	There is rarely a direct link between the people above and violence, toxicity, and racism, but there is a serious indirect link. The primary mechanism of devilry is implicit and indirect because its allows for the shirking of responsibility. I teach the topics I teach in order to inoculate people against this bullshit. But I can't compete with the torrent of bullshit they churn out.
</p>

<p>
	It should also be added that Jordan Peterson bears responsibility for this. His paranoia and fear-mongering about "cultural marxists" has infected the minds of millions of MAGA people, making them feel justified in doing whatever.
</p>

<p>
	His paranoia that the modern left will lead to Stalinism was exactly the opposite of true. The greater danger has always been that the paranoia around Green stoked by the likes of JP and his ilk will lead to right-wing fascism.
</p>

<p>
	This man needs to be discredited as a public intellectual.
</p>

<p>
	For all of JP's study and deep cotemplation of Hitler's evils, he ends up siding with neo-Nazis.
</p>

	Good! That's precisely the culture we need to kill.

<p>
	The idea of chasing infinite wealth at any to cost society is in fact sociopathic and will be seen by future generations as selfish as slavery.

<p>
	In the future, when your fellow humans learn that you are chasing infinite wealth, they should look at you like you are taking a shit in the middle of the Thanksgiving dinner table.

			What I'm talking about is outer game geared towards introverts, with low energy. Approaching a girl on the street, talking to her for 10 minutes, getting her details, and within a few days or a week having her in your bed without ever having to raise your voice or having to do any flashy moves. It looks entirely different and feels completely different. Plus it's more authentic to an introvert.

<p>
	You don't need to do any flashy game. The "friendly chill method" has been part of RSD game from the beginning. Owen just leads with the flashy stuff because it sells seats. In practice most game is not flashy at all. But that doesn't sell.

</p>

<p>
	The military command will never allow him to launch a nuke. Trump does not actually control the nukes. If he ever called for their use his order would go ignored. That's how real power works.

	You make my point for me. In a properly structured society you would not need to rely on a billionaire to personally fund one art teacher at a time at his whim.

	Just like how MAGA is in denial that Trump legit lost, progressives are in denial that Bernie legit lost. They both make excuses because they live in fantasyland and refuse to acknowledge reality. Ideology makes one blind to reality.

	If you have a toothache you go to the dentist. Material problems should be solved at their proper material level. When your child is hungry, you don't pray to God, you go cook your child breakfast.

<p>
	Nobody needs more than $10 million of personal wealth. The money is completely meaningless after that point. In fact, it corrupts you and your children.

			Yeah! I was going you ask you what you thought about Joe Rogan opinions about Biden vs. Trump were. I too thought that he was going too far with his criticisms on Biden. He even criticized Harris too much for having been too "ruthless" of a prosecutor and not being trustworthy enough. His complaints with both Biden and Harris were indeed similar to those of what both Krystal Ball and Saagar Injeti said in their Rising show. In fact, here is this one video I watched several months were Krystal and Saagar were telling some raw truth about Biden back in March:

			</div>
		</div>

		<p>
			Looking back, I now don't like that Rising did that vid. I really think it that vids like that were a mistake for the public to watch.
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Krystal and Sagaar are idiots who enable the MAGA crowd.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone who harps on how bad Joe Biden is, is wrong. Because Biden is not being considered in a vacuum. He's being considered next to a morally depraved wannabe dictator.
</p>

<p>
	I don't doubt that Sagaar and Joe Rogan voted for Trump, and Krystal didn't vote at all. And their audiences followed their lead. That's what idiocy looks like.
</p>

<p>
	If people like Krystal, Sagaar, Rogan, and Jimmy Dore were in charge, and they had the choice between Hitler and Biden, they would criticize Biden and elect Hitler because at least Hitler is anti-establishment. That's how moronically anti-establishment they are. I'm tired of hearing their anti-establishment bullshit. Whatever you say about Biden, he is a league better than Trump. And if your worldview doesn't make that clear to you, your worldview sucks. Enough bullshit. People are getting needlessly killed.
</p>

<p>
	I'm all for Bernie, but when he democratically loses you get behind Biden and like it.
</p>

You are the one discounting menial labor.

<p>
	How about we pay a trash collector $100k/yr? We could do that if we stop giving Wall Street assholes $100 mil and 10 houses on the golf course.

<p>
	No it wouldn't.
</p>

<p>
	It would motivate millions of other people to have capital enough to be creative rather than locked in wage slavery.
</p>

<p>
	For every 1 person with $100 million, 1,000 people are locked into wage slavery.

</p>

<p>
	And 5-MeO-DMT extraction is near impossible. It is a delicate molecule present in very tiny quantities in plants so it will be destroyed in your extraction process and mostly what you'll end up with is N,N-DMT.
