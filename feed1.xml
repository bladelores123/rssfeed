<p>
	I started doing my first businesses when I was 15.
</p>

<p>
	I was registering corporations before I was even allowed to legally own one.
</p>

<p>
	I owned stocks before I was allowed to legally own them.
</p>

<p>
	I got a scuba diving license before the age when I was allowed to legally have one.
</p>

<p>
	No excuses. Creative people find creative solutions.
</p>

<p>
	When I was at that age I thought very strongly that teens should have the same rights as adults. Then I found out how stupid most teens were and now I've changed my mind. Most people should not even be allowed to drive or have kids till they are 25.
</p>

<title>Can you escape wage slavery before becoming one?</title>

You'll probably have to do some amount of it in the beginning.
</p>

<p>
	That's not too big of a problem if it's part of your escape strategy.
</p>

<p>
	The issue is, most people never even had an escape strategy. Then it's really hard to escape.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are like that squirrel who didn't stock up on acorns for winter. Winter is not the problem. The problem is you didn't prepare, and now you're cornered.
</p>

<p>
	Now you gotta work twice as hard to find a solution.

	You just take it for granted that people have a crystal clear conceptual understanding of spirituality and enlightenment. That's cause I've spoiled you guys with videos explaining everything.
</p>

<p>
	No ordinary person knows this shit. Not even close. Not even conceptually.
</p>

<p>
	The typical spiritual practitioner could not describe what enlightenment is in one sentence if his life depended on it. Never mind knowledge of all the complications and traps that come with it.

<title>[WageSlavery] Change morality ? Where F. Nietzsche is on the Spiral Dynamic ?</title>

That is the game of academic philosophy, which might win a battle here or there on technical points, but always loses the war.
</p>

<p>
	Every major Western philosopher basically made a few good points along with a bunch of nonsense. And now we have to waste thousands of hours sorting the few tidbits of wisdom from the overall pile of delusion.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is Neitzche did not have a good understanding the origins of religion. He was reacting against corruption within religion. Which is like shooting fish in a barrel.
</p>

<p>
	Is Neitzche a paragon of integral thinking? Is reading him going to teach you how to be a integral thinker? Your time would be better spent reading some Ken Wilber. That's what real Yellow looks like.
</p>

<p>
	After I realized God, my understanding of and compassion for Christianity shot through the roof. Even though there's so much corruption and stupidity within it. It's like watching a little child giving his best but just failing over and over again. The harder he tries, the harder he fails. It's sad really.
</p>

<p>
	The Christians know not what they preach. The devil sunk his fangs into them real good.
</p>

			That sounds nice to the ear, but I don't know what to make of it.  What is the best way to see through this devil's influence? Ultimately he doesn't exist, like Sam. Knowing this should be enough to see through that Idea's ideas

<p>
	There is a very big difference between thinking you're a thought, and being aware that you are a thought.
</p>

<p>
	You've gotten to the point where you understand no-self conceptually (which is good), but now the real work begins: grasping it ACTUALLY!
</p>

<p>
	Knowing is NOT enough. Knowing must end and Being must replace it.
</p>

<p>
	It is not enough to know that Sam isn't real, Sam must actually cease to exist. ACTUALLY!
</p>

<p>
	Thinking and imagining stuff is NOT actual.
</p>

<p>
	You must deeply realize that you were never born! Your birth is a conceptual story. What is ACTUAL if you stop assuming you were born as a human being? If we erase all your memories and all your thoughts, what is left?
</p>

<p>
	This room? This body? This universe? -- NO! Those are all thoughts!
</p>

<p>
	What is ACTUAL???
</p>

<p>
	Press your awareness on what is ACTUAL, like sizzling bacon to a frying pan, and hold it there, wondering what actuality is.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Psychedelics help. A lot.

Do you cry over it? Do you get angry? Do you seek revenge on the Koopas?
</p>

<p>
	No, because you're aware it's just a game. If you take the game too seriously, you may get so mesmerized by it that you actually get angry at the Koopas.
</p>

<p>
	Likewise with life.
</p>

<p>
	The only problem is, you don't think life is a game. You <u><strong>think</strong></u> it is very real.
</p>

<p>
	The operative word there is "think". Just because you think something is real does not make it so.
</p>

<p>
	The logic of all this is very simple. The problem is, you're not being logical about life, you're highly biased by your fear of death. So your thinking is highly irrational and distorted by your preoccupation with living. You actually have to be insane to believe that life matters.
</p>

<p>
	The trouble with insane people is, they don't know they're insane. If they did, they'd be sane!

<p>
	You can't take away being. Where are you gonna put it? Being already IS nowhere and nothing!
</p>

<p>
	Existence is nothing. It never really happened. There is no difference between existence happening and not happening.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that existence never happened. Well, that's what this is!!! You are inside of Nothing right now! You've just mistaken it for something.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing and Everything are identical because reality cannot tell the difference between something and nothing, existence and nonexistence.

<p>
	That's right. The mind cannot comprehend Nothing. Comprehension is something.
</p>

<p>
	If you had the set of all possible things, that set -- to truly be the set of all possible things -- must include its own negation. Therefore EVERYTHING = NOTHING. Everything and Nothing go full-circle.
</p>

<p>
	If Nothing was excluded from Everything, then Everything would not be Everything. Everything must be all-inclusive, including every possible exclusion!
</p>

<p>
	Paradox is not a bug here, it's the key feature!

<title>[WageSlavery] Change morality ? Where F. Nietzsche is on the Spiral Dynamic ?</title>

</p>

<p>
	But then again, many Orange atheist types will say the same thing today: puritanical Christianity is bad because it is too uptight, too serious, too life denying, too sexually repressive, too theocratic.
</p>

<p>
	Orange people tend to skew towards libertarianism and hedonism. Which is the pendullum swing from extreme repression to "the world is my oyster and all self-denial is bad".
</p>

<p>
	Watch some videos from the Amazing Atheist on YT. He criticisizes religion on these kind of Neitzchian grounds and he's very Orange.
</p>

<p>
	It feels like Neitzche's critique of Christianity is what a modern person's critique of Quakers would be: they are too life-denying, basically kill-joys. They need to loosen up and have a little fun.
</p>

<p>
	What is lost on the Orange person, and Neitzche, is WHY ascetic practices are done. It is not life-denying, it is really just the opposite. The ascetic is the one who becomes most alive. But of course asceticism must be done properly, not as stage Blue religious ritual, which is just an aping of real asceticism.
</p>

<p>
	Neitzsche is basically critisizing all of the egoic corruption within Christianity. But he ended throwing the baby out with the bathwater. What Neiztche really missed is what an ascetic like Sadhguru did. He is the opposite of life-denying.
</p>

<p>
	It is nice to see that Neitzche saw through the absurdity of positivism and atomism. In his day those materialist views had not yet taken dominance like today. Idealism was still somewhat alive. Today it is basically dead in the sciences.
</p>

<p>
	There is no how for the last step. No process, no method. Because it is DIRECT. Being!
</p>

<p>
	It is a quantum leap. Sudden and out of the blue.
</p>

<p>
	They call it the Gateless Gate for good reason. Your mind will never figure it out or sneak up on it. It sneaks up on you.
</p>

<p>
	You just keep pushing until something breaks.
</p>

<p>
	Or, take some 5-MeO and there it is.

The problem is no serious person wants to accept it.
</p>

<p>
	Science is not about to admit that their entire materialist framework is a house of cards.
</p>

<p>
	You may as well be asking the Catholic Church to admit it's full of shit. It's not going to do that! Collective ego doesn't give a fuck about truth, it cares about self-preservation.
</p>

<p>
	You accept science as though it were the word of God without realizing that in reality it's just a giant corrupt bureaucracy run by conservative old men who have children to feed and reputations to maintain. Same as the church.
</p>

<p>
	Wake up!
</p>

<p>
	Notice, the only reason you have scientific truths in your head at all is because it has been told to you by some old man in a position of power, whom you gullibly believed. If an old man in a position of power does not tell you it, how the hell will you ever know about it?? Through YT ads? Through CNN? Through Facebook? Where are you getting your information? Have you realized yet that all mainstream sources of information are propaganda channels for the collective stage Orange ego? You've lived inside an Orange echo-chamber your whole life! You are like a factory cow that's never seen real grass or sunshine a day in your life. If you ever met a real cow who told you about grass and sunshine, you'd think that cow was crazy. But of course the crazy one is you.

People like you usually become psychics or they represses that part of themselves and keep it secret.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you've got some natural paranormal talent and you could easily develop it using books, courses, workshops, and teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Read more New Age books and you'll get into that whole paranormal sub-field of the self-help market.

Focus is a general skill. If you can focus on one thing, you can focus on another. And if you can't focus, you can't focus on anything. The mind jumps around and it makes excuses for why it's good to jump around. Which is why you have not settled on a concentration target. The mind just does not want to.

Remote viewing is NEVER a 100% certain phenomena and it does not work the way materialists want it to work. It is probablisitic and hazy.
</p>

<p>
	You're missing the depth of this problem: no amount of evidence can convince a closed mind. Period.
</p>

<p>
	You can teach yourself astral projection. Bunch of how-to books available for it. It is a settled matter for those who care to know it. The only people who doubt it are the ones who are closedminded and inexperienced.

</p>

<p>
	A) It ain't easy. Takes lots of practice.
</p>

<p>
	B) Start small. 60 mins is too long. You need quality, not quantity. Try doing 5 minutes of laser focused concentration, like a hawk. Do that for a whole month, then move up to 10 mins, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	C) Being addicted to media and smart phone kills your concentration. Realistically you need to disconnect a lot. You're not gonna hit access concentration while binging on YT videos and dicking around on Facebook.

<p>
	It's a silly challenge because you are being asked to provide material proof for immaterial phenomena to the satisfaction of people locked in a hardcore materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The issue isn't the proof, but changing what you consider to be proof. Criteria for proof are always paradigm-dependent.
</p>

<p>
	The paradigm is the problem, not the proof.
</p>

<p>
	You want proof of paranormal? Eat 30 grams of dried mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Just be careful what you wish for. You might get it

I would bet a lot of money that all 5 numbers will come out different.

<p>
	As this post demonstrates, this muscle testing seems way too flaky and subjective to serve as a reliable measure of truth.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest dangers with it is, once you accept it, you're all-in, and it can really distort your entire worldview because you take the numbers seriously and think you can know everything this way.
</p>

<p>
	I thought a lot about adopting it, but ultimately decided that it is too epistemicly risky. It is more powerful to admit that you don't know than pulling numbers out of your ass and convincing yourself that you know something you don't.

Trust me on this. You have not studied this issue deeply enough.
</p>

<p>
	It seems you are conflating "inner" with monkey mind. That is not what inner means. Body sensation and Vipassana and focusing on the breath is all inner. Inner is anything inside the body, outer is anything outside the skin of the body.
</p>

<p>
	But even that point aside, it is totally possible to meditate on one's inner thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	The key factor is not inner vs outer, it is consciousness! Wherever you bring consciousness there will be consciousness, even in the monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, mindfully observing one's thoughts is super useful.
</p>

<p>
	Study some of Shinzen Young's work if you wish to understand this properly and you don't believe me.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	There are entire spiritual paths devoted to focusing on the inner, like Goenka style Vipassana retreats, parts of Shinzen Young's mindfulness system, and various kinds of yoga.
</p>

<p>
	The issue is not inner vs outer. The issue is how much consciousness are you applying to whatever you're observing.
</p>

<p>
	Focusing on the breath (an "inner" phenomena), for example, is one of the most common and effective meditation methods.
</p>

<p>
	So don't fearmonger about inner practices.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't like inner, if you don't find it suitable for you, then that's your preference. Don't universalize it to everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	And to those reading this who might now be scared of doing Vipassana or meditation -- just remember that the things described in this thread are very rare. This is not a reason to avoid serious spiritual practice. Nor is this a condemnation of Vipassana.
</p>

<p>
	You just have to know where to turn to if complications arise.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever you're dealing large numbers of people -- tens of thousands -- rare complications will always arise. Even routine surgery and medications have like 1:100 or 1:1000 serious complications.

<title>Depression after taking psychedelics?</title>

<p>
	Psychedelics are clinically proven treatments for depression.
</p>

<p>
	What you have to understand about depression is that it is self-created. You can get depressed about anything if you put your mind to it. It's all about how you're interpreting reality.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics tend to deconstruct reality. This can make you depressed if you are attached to various fantasies, illusions, and neurotic ways of living.
</p>

<p>
	Your prioritzation of work performance over truth and fulfillment is problematic. That's the wrong approach to life. And psychedelics will rudely awaken you to this point. Which might make you feel depressed if you have built an entire lifestyle and identity around it.
</p>

<p>
	Remeber, sometimes to grow you must pass through a dip. Growth is rarely always up, up, up.

</p>

<p>
	But if you really want to do it: Lynda.com
</p>

<p>
	PHP & MySQL are two the most versatile and well-paid web skills.
</p>

<p>
	A good web developer needs to know HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Linux web servers.

This is standard practice in Zen. And I almost always do it eyes open. And it's worked for me. My first mystical experience was eyes open inquiry. Grounding your awareness in external perceptions is a great way to turn off the monkey mind. It does not have to be distraction at all.
</p>

<p>
	Really, it makes no difference. You can do it either way. It's a matter of personal preference.
</p>

<p>
	Eyes closed does increase sleepiness though, especially if you are already tired.
</p>

<p>
	For me eyes closed only works if I'm super-alert and not sleepy at all.
</p>

<p>
	Not a true psychedelic, but people often like to think of it as one and tell themselves they're using it as one.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to distinguish between recreational and non-recreational uses of substances.
</p>

<p>
	I do not encourage recreation usage. These substances are to be used for metaphysical investigation. Which means you trip hard and deep, rarely. As opposed to mild pleasure highs every other day.
</p>

<p>
	Pot also affects people differently. Some people report more psychedelic effects.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12973-gryner/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="12973" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/12973-gryner/" rel="">@Gryner</a> Sorry to hear of your suffering. What you're describing is definitely highly unusual. Although not unprecedented.
</p>

<p>
	The human mind is a very complex thing. Not all human minds are alike. Some people are much more spiritually attuned and have access to psychic and paranormal realms that very few other people can access. Of course some people are also mentally unstable. Something like what you're describing is pretty rare. You could be legit mentally unstable. Or, you could just be very paranormally attuned and you're discovering this realm for the first time in your life and it comes as a shock and your rational mind does not yet know how to navigate these realms. You could also be repressing some kind of deep past trauma like abuse, molestation, rape, death in the family, etc.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I'd read up a lot more on other people who've had similar experiences. Don't expect quality answers from most Western doctors / scientists. They will just think you're crazy. You need to research transpersonal psychology, psychic stuff, the work of Stan Grof, New Age books, etc. You will probably find some answers there.
</p>

<p>
	There are paranormally gifted people you could find who can help you understand what is going on with you. Try searching for some in your area through Yelp.com
</p>

<p>
	Don't be to quick to judge this experience a negative. It might turn out to be a blessing in disguise, a gateway to a whole new dimension of reality and the beginning of a powerful life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	Do a google search for "vipassana psychosis" and other similar phrases that might describe your experience. You also want to be very careful and precise in describing what happened to you so you and others don't jump to the wrong conclusions.
</p>

<p>
	For example, some of my deepest psychedelic trips on 5-MeO-DMT were so deep, with insights about the nature of reality so profound, that if I did not have a rock solid theoretical foundation, I could definitely see myself feeling like I went insane. If most ordinary people were exposed to such insights point-blank with no preparation they would start to lose their grip on reality in a negative, dysfunctional way.
</p>

<p>
	You could also read books on psychosis to see what that means and how it works. Make sure you read a diversity of books from different perspectives, not just the standard Western academic perspective.
</p>

<p>
	Your ultimate intention should be to figure out what happened to you and why.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Traditionally, many shamans in native tribal cultures develop their abilities after a traumatic psychotic break. So fear not. You are not alone.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Try to do it when you're sharpest during the day, not right before bed. Inquiry is really good after a short nap.
</p>

<p>
	Inquiry requires strong focus skills. You could try doing it using a journal to help keep yourself on track.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, eyes-open works best for me. Closed-eyes tends to put me too much in my head and fall asleep.
</p>

<p>
	When inquiring you want to be in a very wake, sharp, calm state of mind.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO will freak you the fuck out if you've never done psychedelics. You will not know the difference between life and death on it.

</p>

<p>
	All of that is basically nonsense. It does not give a proper account of ego or consciousness at all.
</p>

<p>
	You are accusing me of being biased when really it seems more like you see me that way because you have not yet seriously investigated your own biases.
</p>

<p>
	Scott is not to be taken seriously at all. He's trapped in a stage Orange paradigm. The fact that he is enamoured with Trump's persuasion ability shows you how weak and short-sighted Scott's value system is.
</p>

<p>
	Being enamoured with Trump's ability to persuade is like being enamoured with Hannibal Lecter's skill at eating people.
</p>

<p>
	Just because I don't take such nonsense seriously don't confuse that with closedmindness. You brought a knife to a gun fight here, son <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	When you become very conscious you will easily see through all of this kind of egoic pseudo-intellectualism.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people get the bright idea to try to school me when it would be much wiser to take a seat and listen very carefully to what is being said. Very advanced stuff is being said that very few human beings on Earth understand.

</p>

<p>
	I don't see a proper explanation there of what the universe or reality is.
</p>

<p>
	There is no physical universe. That is just a concept. The universe did not originate from nothing, it is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	There is also no such thing as perception. There is also no such thing as consciousness inside a body.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is not dependent on reality. Reality and consciousness are identical.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like you may have realized no-self, but not the Absolute nature of reality.
</p>

<p>
	There are many depths of enlightenment and nonduality, so be careful.

</p>

<p>
	In the ultimate sense, there is only one substance, one thing in existence, so it is incapable of pointing at itself because it is itself!
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately there is only Being. All symbols collapse into Being.
</p>

<p>
	A snake eating its tail ultimately just turns into a dimensionless dot.
</p>

<p>
	You are the universe trying to point at itself without realizing that pointing is impossible because when you are the whole universe anything you point to is you and anything you point with is also you!
</p>

<p>
	What you are overlooking is Being! Direct Being!
</p>

<p>
	Being cannot be known symbolically. You must BE it.
</p>

<p>
	You must realize that all knowledge and thought is a 2nd order phenomenon, the foundation of which is Being. A 2nd order phenomenon cannot grasp 1st order phenomenon. Just like an image on an LCD screen cannot grasp a pixel because it is made out pixels! An image cannot know pixels because it IS pixels!

<p>
	You are God after all.
</p>

<p>
	Making shit happen is part of the movie! If the hero in the movie just sits around patiently waiting, nothing will happen. See? It will then just be a boring movie of a dude sitting around waiting.
</p>

<p>
	This paradox arises because you are both the watcher of the movie and the actor in the movie. You must learn to act, but in a detached way. Which is tricky and takes some practice.
</p>

<p>
	It's a newbie mistake to interpret no-free-will as an excuse for inaction and laziness. What no-free-will really means is that hard work happens without free will. It does NOT mean: don't do hard work or don't put in any effort. Effort is very necessary. Just realize, that effort is not really coming from the ego but from God/Spirit/Infinite Intelligence working through you. Become a channel for Infinite Intelligence and it will make you work hard to do its bidding. But it will be an enjoyable, free-flowing kind of work.
</p>

<p>
	Yup!
</p>

<p>
	Which is why it's scary.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality means that all distinctions are arbitrary, including the distinction between life and death, reality and fantasy.
</p>

<p>
	What's left is the Groundless Ground, The Void, The Infinite, The Absolute, The Godhead -- which is totally indistinct.

<p>
	Yes, of course!
</p>

<p>
	What you're missing is the distinction between thinking vs being.
</p>

<p>
	Thought != Being
</p>

<p>
	Thought of being != Being
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of neti neti is to stop all thought. Once all thoughts die down, whatever is left, is pure being.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever your true nature is, you are it prior to thought.
</p>

<p>
	The actuality of what you are is a constant. But holding that as a thought is not it.
</p>

<p>
	What are you when you are not thinking about yourself?
</p>

<p>
	Don't think the answer!!!
</p>

<p>
	BE it!
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Yes, you can be conscious of Infinity in your sleep. Happens to me occasionally. It's really cool. You exist as an infinite singularity.
</p>

<title>How to distinguish between ego trick / genuine insight?</title>

<p>
	You can't. Therein lies the whole puzzle of life.
</p>

<p>
	You don't know what you don't know.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why it's so important to stay openminded and humble. And to seek out alternative perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	You could always be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Yesterday's insight is tomorrow's delusion.
</p>

<p>
	A genuine commitment to truth at all costs is also very important. Just through radical self-honesty you can cut through 99% of fantasies and illusions. Most people do not set the intention to be self-honest.
</p>

If you're between 14 to 22, you're still basically a teenager and will require more sleep than an adult in their 30s or 40s.
</p>

<p>
	It also very much depends on how you use your mind and body, how much you work, how much you study, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's also a good ideas to optimize your sleep environment by lightproofing your whole bedroom, getting a good mattress, and eliminating noise.
</p>

<p>
	Diet also affects your sleep a lot. Cut back on carbs, wheat, and junk food.
</p>

<p>
	You might also want to get your thyroid hormone levels checked. Underactive thyroid is very common these days, causing fatigue and sleepiness.

<p>
	LSD is fantastic and super profound. Hard to go wrong with it.

</p>

<p>
	The materialist, rationalist paradigm is the chief obstacle. It must be undermined in the same way Copernicus and Galileo undermined the stationary Earth paradigm. This takes deacades and centuries because the status quo always clings. That's just what collective egos do.
</p>

<p>
	The book I'm working on and the videos I'll be releasing are designed to deconstruct materialism and rationalism. That is my long term project.

<p>
	You might also want to take a stab at self-inquiry. It has a very different feel than meditation. Meditation without serious self-inquiry tends to not produce enlightenment. It is important that you start to deconstruct the self and reality. The upside of this is that it has positive effects long before enlightenment happens. You can get a lot of value from just deconstructing everything you know. Pick a thing and deconstruct it. Deconstruction dovetails very nicely with psychedelics too.
</p>

<p>
	If you are really serious about spiritual growth, you can get a ton of it very quickly by combining contemplation, deconstruction, and a psychedelic trip once very two weeks for 1 year. With this formula you will grow more in 1 year than you have in the last 10 years combined.
</p>

<p>
	My deepest and fastest growth has come from this approach. In fact, it's too effective. I've had to back off on it because the mind can only integrate so much so fast.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation requires hardcore practice to get serious results. Most people who meditate will never get nondual states because that usually requires industrial-grade levels of meditation. It's very easy to waste years meditating ineffectively, doing weak versions of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Also, not all people have the same level of spiritual atunement. For some people meditation is easy and they don't need a lot of it to get big results. But this is not most people.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are far more effective for nondual insights and states. So yeah, doing some higher dose trips will definitely get you a taste of what you're after.
</p>

<p>
	But as far as your daily practice I'd say, either upgrade your technique to something more stringent, or switch to Kriya Yoga. I find Kriya far more effective than meditation.
</p>

<p>
	To get serious results from meditation usually requires doing hardcore week-long retreats and 1000s of hours of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	I'm one of those people for whom meditation is not that effective. For meditation to be effective you must develop laser-focused one-pointed concentration. Watch my video: Meditation vs Concentration.
</p>

<p>
	I've met people who have done 20 years of Vipasanna but still don't know what enlightenment is. This is actually the norm.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is a very radical state of consciousness. Very few human beings are capable of it without serious practice or outside means like psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to experience the highest levels of human consciousness, schedule a 5-MeO retreat. It will be worth the hassle and it will motivate you to meditate more.
</p>

<p>
	Forum comments are my version of Lays potatoes chips. Can't take this shit too seriously or you'll go insane trying to out-logic all the nonsense that exists on the internet.
</p>

<p>
	Many things don't even rise to the level of warranting a serious reply, in which case ridicule and snark becomes an effective tool. It's the equivalent of a Zen slap across the face.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like Trump has not earned enough respect to be reasoned with. Sometimes you gotta call devils for devils when you see them. Pretending that a devil is not a devil just to sound "fair" is actually untruthful. And that's exactly what a devil like Trump will try to exploit to his advantage.
</p>

<p>
	The middle ground between truth and falsehood is falsehood.

</p>

<p>
	You have to appreciate that most nondual teachers are preaching to the choir. They only teach that tiny percentage of the population which is already primed and ripe for the teaching. They make no effort to prime the rest of the population. You either come begging the Zen master for a teaching, or you have no chance to even enter the Zendo.
</p>

<p>
	It's one game to teach primed people nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	It's another game entirely to prime the vulgar masses to be receptive to nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to make your life easy as a teacher, you only teach students who are Spiral stages Green and above. The really hard work is teaching Orange and below, who are dense, arrogant, and numerous as fuck.

<p>
	That is where you are wrong.
</p>

<p>
	The confirmation bias in this case is on behalf of the materialist scientists who reject the statistical and anecdotal data.
</p>

<p>
	The data is all there. People just suck at handling the radical truth.
</p>

<p>
	The mind naturally denies whatever does not fit its survival agenda. That's all it is.
</p>

<p>
	Bigoted minds deny cutting-edge truths all the time. This has been happening in every domains of life for over 5000 years of human history. And you can bet it happens today.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you're trying to capture subtle phenomena using gross means, like trying to capture a delicate butterfly using a bulldozer. And then you complain that butterflies don't exist. Yeah, because you kill them with your fucking bulldozer.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is: leave your bulldozer at home.
</p>

	That is my natural inclination, but one of the problems with teaching self-actualization and nonduality is that people get so sucked into all sorts of twisted ideologies -- like that of JP, Sam Harris, Stefan Molyneux, SJW, capitalism, post-modernism, anti-post-modernism, etc.  -- that it becomes impossible to teach them without some amount of deconstruction work.
</p>

<p>
	That is in fact the unconscious goal of people like JP, Sam Harris, Stefan Molyneux, etc. -- their job is to make the intellectual marketplace so muddied, confused, and polarized that it becomes impossible for people to find serious spiritual teachings. This is no accident. This is how the devil works: through muddying the water. The devil knows he can never win on merit because his position if fundamentally false, so all he can do is confuse people and stall out the clock.
</p>

<p>
	This is a classic tactic use by global warming deniers, for example. They just need to muddy the waters and sow enough doubt to stall out the clock to get their paycheck.
</p>

<p>
	So some of these devils need to be called out on their BS sometimes, to put them in their place. Otherwise the unwitting masses start to take them too seriously. An intelligent devil like JP or Sam Harris is a dangerous thing. It is not obvious how he is wrong and how best to rebut him. To a casual observer a lot of the things he says ring true and reasonable. Of course that's precisely how the devil works. He sprinkles nuggets of truth into his bullshit lasagna.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of all ideologies is to distract from truth-seeking. Which is why ideologies have been so widespread throughout all of human history up to and including today. The devil's strategy is: flood the marketplace with so much bullshit that people cannot even tell that actual Truth is possible. If you want to safeguard a precious diamond, throw it into an ocean of liquid shit full of fake diamonds. Then no one will ever find it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't agree that Plotinus was that low.
</p>

<p>
	Seems clear to me from his writings that he was deeply nondual and conscious of God way beyond no-self.

<p>
	How is it possible for thing A to see thing B?

<p>
	You are taking this ablility for granted. As if it is possible. It is not!

<p>
	How can thing A be aware of thing B?
</p>

<p>
	If a brain can be self-aware why can't a coffee table?
</p>

<p>
	To say that God is self-aware is to say that everything is self-aware.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, there is nothing in existence but self-awareness. Name one thing which is not self-aware.
</p>

<p>
	Self-awareness has no opposite.

Nietzche just misunderstood spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	What he blasts as "slave morality" is just surrender, humility, love, peace, and enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	 Nietzche's entire understanding of the origins of religion are wrong. Humility was not forced on anyone. Humility is the end result of ego loss.
</p>

<p>
	Nietzche's ego demonized it.
</p>

<p>
	I would put him at Orange. He hated Blue. A classic Orange atheist nihilist knee-jerk reaction to Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Many statistical studies have been done on ESP. They all come out positive in meta-analysis.
</p>

<p>
	The chances of ESP not being true are like one in a billion according to the statistical analysis. The problem is that no serious scientist wants to accept it because it would ruin his career.
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention that you can teach yourself to do it.
</p>

<p>
	Check out Dean Radin's research.

</p>

<p>
	If only it were as easy as to just sit down and make a game.
</p>

<p>
	You must be extremely prudent and strategic about testing niches and taking risks in business.
</p>

<p>
	Starting a successful biz usually requires many years of experience within a certain field. You must know many of the traps of your field.
</p>

<p>
	The advice is, find your life purpose and master a specific narrow field.
</p>

Read 10 diverse books on nonduality and that will clear a lot of stuff up for you. You don't have to reinvent the wheel here. Mankind has understood nonduality for 5000 years at least. It's all been written down for those who care to read.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like you're struggling your way through mathematics when all you gotta do is pick up a math textbook.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is actually older and more solid than mathematics. They just don't teach it in school because it destroys all reality and society.
