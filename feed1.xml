</p>

<p>
	Can you see how your hatred for religion is really just hatred of reality, and therefore hatred of yourself? Which is precisely what you don't like about religion. So you're hating on haters.
</p>

<p>
	Adding evil on top of evil does not create Good, it only compounds the evil.
</p>

<p>
	You have turned religion into your shadow.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to transcend this issue, apply love to religious people. Stop seeing them as separate from you. Stop judging them.
</p>

<p>
	It would be helpful if you studied religion more and developed a deep understanding of why religion exists.
</p>

<p>
	Let me reframe your question from a fundamentalist religious person's POV:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Christian: How long will it take until all Muslims are dead?
	</li>
	<li>
		Nazi Aryan: How long will it take until all Jew are dead?
	</li>
	<li>
		Muslim: How long will it take until all infidels are dead?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That is what you're doing.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than dreaming of destroying stuff, how about you learn to accept reality as it is?
</p>

<title>Will Science ever prove Non-Duality?</title>

</p>

<p>
	The movement of your hand is not at all the same as understanding Einstein's General Relativity and being able to predict the existence of a black hole 100 years before it is photographed.
</p>

<p>
	You are underappreciating the degree of intelligence and understanding that goes into science. It is not so mechanical, and you cannot seperate it from truth in the way that you are trying to do.
</p>

<p>
	You are creating a duality between science and truth. There is a profound connection between metaphysics and epistemology.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is far more nuanced and profound, and no bit of forum explanation is going to do it justice.
</p>

<p>
	You take understanding for granted. Genuine understanding is possible. This is a very amazing thing!
</p>

<p>
	How is it that a dumb simplification can predict a black hole?
</p>

<p>
	All of this must be deeply contemplated, not replied to with dismissive answers.
</p>

<p>
	Without properly understanding this issue science and spirituality will not be integrated but fragmented from each other. In the future, mankind will integrate the two.
</p>

<p>
	What is the connection between science, truth, and understanding?
</p>

<p>
	You cannot just dismiss all science as delusion, since there is no fundamental division between science and spiritual inquiry. Spirituality is the science of spirit, you might say.

<p>
	There's a pretty massive difference between 10ug of LSD and 125ug of LSD.
</p>

<p>
	Or 0.5g of mushrooms and 4g of mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	Or 15mg of 5-MeO and 30mg of 5-MeO.
</p>

<p>
	Doubling a psychedelic dose more than quadruples the effects.

<p>
	"Give me some advice for doing personal development successfully" is very broad.

He's interested in going as deep as possible and telling the truth like it is with no filter, weather people like it or not, similar to J. Krishnamurti. It's more so Spira, Tolle, Watts, Mooji, Sadhguru etc... that are to spread it wide as possible within peoples limited understanding, and thus heightening their level of awareness. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I try to go wide and teach to ordinary people. I don't see myself as the deepest. I see myself as a bridge-builder, helping people to interconnect various parts of reality. At least that's my role for now. It might change in the future.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Sadhguru does not give a fuck about helping you understand how science and spirituality interconnect. I do.
</p>

<p>
	What is the connection between Western science & spirituality? << That's a really good question to contemplate.
</p>

			Okay, I see. But in instances where god is speaking words to/at someone, surely they would realise that it was themselves if the experience where true?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, surely not. Duality is a tricky beast. In this case they are getting close to Truth but they still haven't realized that self/other is a duality which must collapse. Despite that, they can still glean some nugget of truth from that experience, like the sense of Divine Love. That sense of Divine Love might then inspire the person to be more selfless and to practice more yoga until finally they realize one day that self = other and that self = God. Then their realization will be complete.
</p>

<p>
	My point is, you should allow people a path towards the Absolute without cutting them down at intermediate stages. It's very demotivating and confusing for a spiritual seeker to realize something like Divine Love only to have a callous person tell them something like, "That's all ego delusion."
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if your child came home from 1st grade and showed you the A+ he got on his homework and you responded with, "So what? That's all horse shit. Where is your college diploma? Talk to me when you get your diploma."
</p>

<p>
	It's not realistic to expect everyone to become a Buddha without a lengthy spiritual path. We should allow people to walk their paths, being patient with them and helping them out without cutting them down.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	What I'm telling you is that the situation is more nuanced than that. Mystical experiences -- even if they are not full-blown enlightenment -- are not pure ego or delusion. They can be valuable, truthful, and healing. So don't be so quick to dismiss them.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is not 100% Absolute Truth does not mean it should be dismissed. Much of what we deal with in this work is various degrees of half-truths. That is okay. We shouldn't expect perfection from humans.

<p>
	I would say you're not deeply enlightened because if you were deeply enlightened you'd realize that you are God.
</p>

<p>
	But your experience of that old man, if it really occurred, really occurred, and it may contain some deep truth, such as that you are loved or that God is real. It's just a partial truth.
</p>

<p>
	Most truths are partial truths. Partial truths are still valuable. You can't always expect 100% unadulterated truth. Most people need to do a lot of work before they are ready for that.

<p>
	It's not so simple. Mystical experiences are common and genuine. Of course delusion can surround them too. And they are ALWAYS interpreted through one's stage of Spiral development (which is often as low as Purple or Blue).
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're struggling to understand this is because you're coming at it from a narrow materialist paradigm. Where you are expecting there to be one external physical-like reality which all people see. That's not how reality works. Stuff is more fluid and relative than that. Different people experience different realities. Some people might see an angel while you do not. This does not make the angel any less "real" any more so than you never seeing a kangaroo makes it any less real.

<p>
	Sure you can. You can be more or less aligned with the Truth. Someone like Donald Trump is God, but he is not aligned with it so his power, love, and goodness is very limited. There are many degrees of alignment and embodiment. For example, an awake racist is not fully aligned with the Truth. And yes, there are awake racists, sexists, and so forth. Many people have awoken but stayed at stage Blue ethnocentric. That's very common in the East.
</p>

<p>
	Some folks act more God-like than others, even though of course all folks are God. Hitler did not act very God-like. He was more of a devil. But of course the devil is none other than God. But it's a God which lacks self-awareness that it is God. So what we're talking about is degree of awareness of oneself as God. For example, I know that I am God. But I could be more aware of it than I presently am.

<p>
	The problem with that is that Ramana Maharshi was clearly extremely spiritually gifted. Whether it was genetics or good karma doesn't really matter. He had unique capacities which ordinary people do not have. So comparing yourself to him can be problematic. It's like Arnold saying that benching 500 lbs is a piece of cake. Yeah, for him it is.
</p>

<p>
	If your brain is already in a spiritual configuration, then obviously you don't need yogic techniques which are designed to rewire your brain into a spiritual configuration. If you are 7 feet tall you don't need high heels. Some folks are born 7 ft tall. Some are born spiritual midgets.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Yoga has more of a physiological and bodily component to it than meditation or self-inquiry. This is not to say that self-inquiry or meditation are bad, but there is good reason why yogis do all those bodily practices. It really helps with embodying one's enlightenment. There is an energetic component to enlightenment which could easily be missed if all you do is self-inquire. Emotional blockages can reside in the body.
</p>

<p>
	After the drug wears off you are not totally back to normal. Permanent shifts are made. You have to stop thinking of this process of awakening in a binary way of "awake/not awake". There's much more nuance to it.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I think yoga is more powerful than meditation or self-inquiry. But that's my guess and it could vary for person to person. If meditation was as powerful as yoga, yogic techniques would be obsolete and they would not have been invented. That's my guess. It's hard to fairly compare all the techniques because they each require so much training that no one person has mastered them all. Also, no two people have identical capacities.
</p>

<p>
	The point is: keep an open mind and experiment to see what works best for you. I am not trying to convince anyone that yoga is best. It's hard to argue that yoga is not powerful. So it's worth exploring.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe only take the top-tier ones like modafinil. The ones that give you the most bang for your buck.

</p>

<p>
	1) Keep in mind that most people look happy from the outside when in fact they suffer deeply inside and their lives are going down hill. Many celebrities fit this description.
</p>

<p>
	2) It takes time to build up a great thing. Investment is required. For example, starting a business might put you into debt more so than someone working at Starbucks. But in the long-run you will be much wealthier as a business owner.
</p>

<p>
	3) Learning theory takes time and energy away from practice. Some guy totally focused on practice will achieve more results in the short term but less in the long term.
</p>

<p>
	4) You cannot compare yourself to anyone else. Other people are not in your shoes. They have different abilities, strengths, and weaknesses. Some people are "naturals" in certain areas of life which you will have to work your ass off to attain.
</p>

<p>
	5) Progress is highly non-linear. It has ups and downs. Sometimes you must take 1 step back to go 2 steps forward.
</p>

<p>
	You need to have a vision and long time horizon and be patient.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Be Fucking Patient!

<p>
	Besides which, how would you know? Have you tried all the techniques? Have you gone all the way? How would you even know what "all the way" is? All you have are stories from gurus. And how do you know which guru is right and which is wrong? Because they certainly don't all say the same thing.

<p>
	There are many valid techniques.
</p>

<p>
	But to reach the highest levels will require that you use these techniques with such focus and intensity that it will physiologically change how your brain fires.
</p>

<p>
	You have to consider: your brain physiology puts some hard limits on your degree of consciousness. Which is why psychedelics are so great. They change your brain physiology in such a way that you are able to access states of consciousness which most ordinary brains cannot access without incredible periods of practice, or even at all.
</p>

<p>
	Consider the possibility that if your brain was twice bigger your awakening would be deeper in ways that a normal human brain cannot even fathom.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga is specifically designed to change the physiology of your brain. Think of it like doubling the size of your brain. Of course you are not physically doubling its size, you're just changing how it's wired. Which is just as significant. And not just the brain but also the bodily nervous system.
</p>

<p>
	Do not assume that all people or spiritual practitioners have access to the same brain hardware. Not at all. Every brain is unique, with unique pros and cons. Some people's brain hardware is so inadequate they cannot add two numbers together or recognize their mother or father.
</p>

<p>
	People take all this for granted. The reality of how spirituality works is much more complex than most people are willing to admit.
</p>

<p>
	And the paradox is, brains still don't exist <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Tricky, tricky stuff.

<p>
	The mind can get "downloads" from God/Universal Intelligence. These downloads can be verbal or non-verbal. It doesn't really matter what symbols are used. God can "speak" to you through math equations, English, Japanese, ancient Egyptian, colors, an angel, an image of Christ, Ganesha, tea leaves, or a million other things.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's also possible for the ego-mind to be deluded and mistake it's own devilry for communication from God. Alex Jones is a great example of this. So you always have to be careful to distinguish your personal egoic agenda from downloads from Universal Intelligence. It can be tricky to sort this out if one's mind is no sufficiently pure. The devil loves to pretend his own agenda is God's agenda.
</p>

<p>
	As you become more conscious and spiritually attuned, it will feel like you're in communion with God all the time. Hell, you ARE God, so eventually you realize that every thought arising in your mind is how God gets shit done through your body. Really what's going on is that a field infinitely intelligent consciousness is creating reality. This is happening at all times. Every thought you have is part of this field.
</p>

<p>
	As the ego-mind dissolves, God takes over your entire mind and body. Your mind and body become indistinguishable from God. Eventually, if you purify yourself enough, every action you take becomes a movement of the entire universe. Every time your finger moves, the intelligence of the whole universe conspires to move it towards Absolute Goodness and Perfection. The movement of your finger creates Heaven on Earth. Your entire experience of life glows with God's consciousness. You are illuminated. Your will becomes God's Will. You are totally at ONE with God, with zero distance between the two. All duality collapses into Absolute Oneness which knows no opposite. Total self-realization has occurred. Now you finally understand the magnitude what you are. You are Infinity. Your Will is creating the entire universe.
</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	No, you must contemplate and observe it very deeply. Only be becoming very familiar with how survival works can you begin to liberate yourself of it.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not conscious of survival in detail, it is controlling your entire life and it is making you an unwitting devil.
</p>

<p>
	The whole problem is that life is NOT a game for you. You take life all too seriously because you're not conscious of what survival is. Life only becomes a game once you are fully conscious of survival. Right now you are a slave of survival. You are a survival robot and you don't even know it yet.

	Just because you don't have a concept of it doesn't mean you aren't doing it. A squirrel has no concept of survival either, but it's doing it 24/7.

	You are not appreciating the depth of this issue of survival. It's worth you contemplating further, rather than dismissing it.

<p>
	To attain the deepest liberation, survival must be deeply contemplated and observed. Emotional mastery requires consciousness of one's survival mechanisms. 99% of emotions are survival.

	In practice it's not a big threat. Just start with a small dose.
</p>

<p>
	The worst thing you can do as a newbie is take too big a dose. So always err on the side of smaller and you should be okay.

He has no idea how deep the rabbit hole goes. He's still within the materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The stuff I talk about is what the most advanced yogis realize and embody. Total God-realization. You are not going to acheive that with a bit of self-inquiry or meditation. It requires a rewiring of your entire brain and even body. Which is what yogic techniques are designed to do.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like Sadhguru is a good example. He is living in a full state of God-realization.

<p>
	There is no egoic free will, but there is God's infinite Will, and you are God. So it goes full-circle.
</p>

<p>
	Free will vs no-free-will is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	In practice your will is a sliver of God's infinite Will, just like your intelligence is a sliver of God's infinite Intellignece. By becoming more God-like you get more will and more intelligence.

<p>
	The rabbit hole goes very deep. There are facets of the Absolute that even most enlightened people have not realized.
</p>

<p>
	This is not just a verbal or stylistic difference. You can realize Nothing but miss Everything. You can realize Everything but miss Nothing. Or you can realize them both at once to see they are identical.
</p>

<p>
	And it does not end there. There's more! There's God, there's Infinity, there's Intelligence, there's Love, there's Eternity, there's Goodness, there's Will, there's Truth, there's Consciousness, there's Paradise, and it still does not end there.
</p>

<p>
	You can spend a lot of time understanding all the above at deeper and deeper degrees of wholeness and interconnection.
</p>

<p>
	Do not expect a typical enlightened YouTuber to have that level of total understanding. This is rare, rare stuff. It requires extreme levels of seeking and openmindedness which almost no one has. Neo-advaita is not gonna cut it.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I don't claim to be awake. But I know how deep the rabbit hole goes. It's ironic how many awake people do not. See, this shit is very, very tricky. When you try to boil this work down to a binary categorization like awake/not-awake you over-simplify and distort it. If only it were so simple.

I actually agree with everything you wrote. Life IS brutal, and we only got here off the backs of countless other human and animal lives. Of course! If the natives did not eat animals, they would have died, and whether that's "right or wrong," here we are. Ta-Da! 
		</p>

		<p>
			However, I feel like you may only have part of the story here. While there is a necessary duality of cooperation vs. competition, nature as a whole is predominantly based on cooperation. Our higher light and instincts, while an integration of the two, is something that ultimately transcends human nature. Your example of the two enlightened beings highlighted something that I believe adds another twist to this story. See, two lesser men would probably debate which life was worth more, and if they couldn't reach a consensus (which they wouldn't), it would inevitably turn to a fight to the death. However, we're talking about two enlightened beings. Would they debate which life was worth more? No, that's impossible. Would they fight each other to the death? No. I firmly believe that the only conclusion to be reached, from a nondual universal perspective, is for both to die in peace. I personally would rather go out that way than to live with that on my conscience. There is something here that transcends animal instincts, to appeal to karmic balance.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm not asking you to agree with me, I'm just asking you to seriously consider this possibility. Would you sacrifice your body so that another may live? Would you kill another man so that you may live? You are both the victim and the perpetrator, so only if you answered Yes to both of these questions would your scenario play out... But would it? That's a stalemate! There would be no purpose to any of this nonsense, would there?
		</p>

		<p>
			As an example, remember the brilliant ending sequence of the two ships in <em>The Dark Knight</em>? See, the Joker was convinced that either one of the boats would blow the other up. That's human nature, is it not? And yet, it took a brave prisoner to come forward to do the unthinkable. "I'll do what you should of did a long time ago," as he threw the detonation device out the window. That was the action of an enlightened being. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course it could work that way in the most ideal circumstance. But so what? In real life that is not how 99.9999% of beings behave. I was more interested in showing you how life works.
</p>

<p>
	In practice even the most enlightened people are still forced to navigate life. Even if they don't eat people, they behave selfishly in other less dramatic ways.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, don't over-idealize enlightened people. You will be disappointed when they fail to live up to your utopian fantasies.
</p>

<p>
	You must explain why so many enlightened people act so selfishly, and your answer cannot be: because they aren't really enlightened.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Obviously not. My point is that the arguments humans have are not always small-minded.
</p>

<p>
	Who should control the Middle East? Iranians? Jews? Arabs? The US? That's not a small-minded argument. That's a serious survival issue affecting hundreds of millions of people. How is it going to get resolved? How many people are you willing to sacrifice in order to resolve that situation well? 10 thousand? 100 thousand? 1 million? 10 million?
</p>

<p>
	See, it's not so easy. Life is extremely complex and counter-intuitive. By trying to compromise you might end up getting 10 million people killed.
</p>

<p>
	Are you going to compromise or fight with the big oil companies on global warming? If global warming gets out of hand, millions of people are going to die from starvation, disease, displacement, violence, and civil war.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that small vs big is a duality. Small things lead to big things which lead to giant things. So the small details matter.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hahaha... this kind of naivete is exactly why I said what I said. This is not how life works.
</p>

<p>
	Life ALWAYS works at the expense of other life. You can minimize that to some degree, but you cannot eliminate that totally. Just the fact that you are alive means some other organism cannot be alive. For example, the fact that you were the winning sperm means that millions of other sperm had to die.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you're not yet conscious of the trade-offs and costs of life. Study more closely how life works. Life and death are a duality which necessarily must feed off itself. It's not just an accident that wolves must hunt rabbits to survive and squirrels must hunt acorns. For every acorn that a squirrel eats, that's one potential oak tree that dies. So don't think that squirrels are innocent little creatures. Squirrels are acorn murdering machines.
</p>

<p>
	This needs to be accepted and understood, not avoided or worked around. You must profoundly realize how life and death are intertwined. Otherwise you will be under the illusion that if we could just get rid of death, everything will be peachy. No! The point is to realize that death itself is inevitable. You cannot be alive without dying.
</p>

<p>
	Cooperation and competition are a duality. You cannot have a life of 100% cooperation and zero competition. You must realize how the two co-arise.
</p>

<p>
	You have a self/ego for a very good reason: because you need it to survive. Selfishness plays an important role in life. You cannot just be 100% selfless and stay alive. If that were possible, ego would not be needed and it would not exist. You must realize that selfishness and selflessness are a duality too. You cannot have one without the other.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, we can still work towards a more selfless society. But don't get overly utopian about it. People still gotta shit, eat, make money, fuck, and kill. Be clear-eyed about such realities. Life has hard stakes. Don't take survival for granted. It's very easy to create a sceneario where you will have to kill to survive, and you will. You do it every day. You just conveniently ignore it, because it's not useful to your survival. You are a survival machine first and foremost.
</p>

<p>
	When a Native American hunter killed his prey, he would say a little prayer for taking the animals life. He realized that he had to take the animal's life to sustain his own. That is what it means to be aware of your selfishness. This is not something to feel guilty about. This is something you can turn into a spiritual experience. Survival is a spiritual experience (if you look at it the right way, without taking it for granted).
</p>

<p>
	It's very important to face the brutality of life, rather than trying to avoid it, pretending like it's not there. Life is fucking brutal. Business is brutal. Relationships are brutal. Etc. This brutality is a real test of your capacity to love. Your love can become so strong precisely because life is so brutal. You can cry for every carrot you eat. "Thank you carrot, for giving me your life. I promise to use your energy towards the highest good."
</p>

	If two enlightened people are locked in a cage with no food, one of them will likely eat the other one. This is the nature of survival and it is not wrong. It must be accepted and embraced.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to over-idealize or over-romanticize life. People still got to eat, shit, make money, and fuck if society is to exist. Life is Love, but life is also brutal.

<title>Is having good manners and being polite stage green values?</title>

<p>
	The key thing to understand about good manners and etiquette is that they are all a social construction and a survival function. They are not absolute. The mistake that many stage Blue people make is they take manners, social norms, cultural customs, paying respect, tradition, etc as absolutes, and therefore normative. In other words, you SHOULD and MUST adhere to social norms. This is delusional.
</p>

<p>
	As you become conscious and developed you will naturally respect people without making it a dogma or a should.
</p>

<p>
	Manners, social norms, cultural customs, paying respect, tradition, etc become problematic when they are done mechanically in lieu of consciousness.

<p>
	Just understand that whatever your role-models hate or judge, you will probably start to hate or judge too. If your role-model has a shadow, you will tend to absorb their shadow and make it your own. Make sure you're aware of what the speaker's shadow is. His shadow is the place he's reacting from, which lessens his alignment with Truth and Goodness.
</p>

<p>
	Remember that all judgment is delusion. No exceptions.

<p>
	There is no such thing as bad, AT ALL! Bad is an egoic delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Anything which exists is Absolutely Good. Murder included and anything else you can conjure up.
</p>

<p>
	Without an ego you would not be bothered by murder.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: from the perspective of the universe as a whole, nothing can be bad because there is nothing outside the universe to contrast it with. This is one of the radical consequences of ONENESS.

<p>
	No, it makes you understand that all such things are necessary aspects of Absolute Good. You do not become apathetic. You are filled with unconditional love. The love is so deep it may seem like apathy from an egoic perspective because the ego confuses selfishness with love.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

			Because meanwhile it is technically true that the ultimate nature of reality is Good (concuousness / Brahman), that doesn't mean that empathy for those who are suffering and working towards a fully awake human community living as one in harmony peace egalitarianism and altruism suddenly get canceled even if it looks like a tall order now.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's easy for the ego-mind to see Absolute Love and spiritual detachment as apathy. It only appears that way because the ego-mind is so attached.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Love requires detachment because so long as you are attached to anything, your love is highly partial. You cannot love the whole world from a position of attachment. Anything you are attached to means you can't love its opposite. If you are attached to peace, you cannot love war. If you are attached to love, you cannot love hate. If you are attached to justice, you cannot love injustice. If you attached to beauty you cannot love the ugly. Etc. Absolute Love loves EVERYTHING! No exceptions. Anything you don't or can't love, that's ego being scared and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	So you should distinguish between dualistic love (what most people call love) and nondual Love, which knows no opposite and has no boundary.
</p>

<p>
	Like I explained in the Understanding Duality episode, good and bad are relative whereas Good is the transcendent absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The transcendence of good/bad does not leave you in a neutral place the way most people would imagine. It puts you in Heaven.
</p>

<p>
	Similar to how the trascendence of science and religion does not leave you with agnosticism, it makes you God!

<p>
	I don't know who trungpa is.
</p>

<p>
	If a teacher is an asshole, then yeah, I'd say he's got some devil in him. He has more work to do. He can be awake but he has a repressed shadow which needs work.
</p>

<p>
	There are also degrees of awakening. Such a perosn may not have awoken to absolute Love for example, which is why he's still an asshole. It's pretty easy to realize no-self without realizing God or Love or Goodness and be an asshole.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why a good Zen master will drive his students to go deeper after their first kensho. The first kensho is just the beginning. A good master will not let a student stop at the first kensho. There is what's called post-satori practice.
</p>

<title>Spiral Dynamics case study on an ex-KGB member</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The key issue with nations is the stage of development of their infrastructure. It does not matter what the ideology is so much as what values the infrastructure is embodying. If the courts, police, and politicians are corrupt, and the economy is pre-industrial or only based on one resource like crude oil, and there is no seperation of chruch and state, then no Green government is possible even if a Green ideology is spread to everyone.
</p>

<p>
	It works just like with individual development. Just because you read a lot of books or watch a lot of videos about personal development does not mean you will be highly developed. It's very easy to create a lofty image in your mind of how developed you are when in reality your diet is terrible, your emotions are all over the place, you have a crazy monkey mind, your finacial situation is a disaster, you live in a bad environment, your friends are criminals, etc. Such a person will not be able to function at a high level because the infrastructure is so poor.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, the underlying motivation is the key moreso than any particular behavior. You can respectful at any stage of the Spiral. It's just that stage Blue values respect for tradition for its own sake and becomes rigid about it. For example, you must respect the Pope because he is a spokeman for the one true God, Lord Jesus Christ, and he is infallible. By not respecting him you will go to hell. Bow your head before the Pope or we may torture you for being a devil worshipper.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, that concept is straight from Zen itself. Zen masters teach about Zen devils and Yako Zen, aka "wild fox Zen".
</p>

<p>
	Technically, a Zen devil is one who practices Zen without ever reading scriptures. And a wild fox is one who only reads about Zen without practicing.
</p>

<p>
	A Zen devil will say things like, "Who cares about the suffering of others? I am liberated and suffering is an illusion so nothing matters." Or stuff like, "Who cares about global warming? The world is an illusion anyways."

<p>
	Ken has a very robust grasp of awakening and nonduality, and much more.
</p>

<p>
	His work is not just about awakening, it is about stages of development and various kinds of pathologies in this work.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is independent of one's stage of development. Both are important. To awaken but still be stuck at a low level of development is very common and dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	If your teaching only emphasizes awakening and nothing else, it is a narrow and incomplete teaching which will produce a lot of problems if it's taught to lots of people.
</p>

<p>
	Stages of development are extremely important and yet they are virtually unknown to most teachers and traditional teachings. Which is why so many spiritual practioners come out half-baked.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot understand stages of development by sitting on a meditation cushion, even if you are the best meditator in the world. Introspection is not enough.

<p>
	Because without a self, nothing is bad.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize you are immortal and infinite (the Absolute), you will be in literal heaven, where nothing bad exists. Heaven is an Absolute!
</p>

<p>
	Once your perspective of life becomes absolutely holistic, you will literally not be able to see bad any more. You will realize that "bad" is a fictitious concept. You will realize there was only absolute Good.
</p>

<p>
	It's a life-transforming realization. This is how you transcend suffering.

<p>
	It's understandable that an ex-Soviet would have an allergy to Green and leftists because of his personal experiences with Soviet communism. The mistake though is to confuse stage Blue and even Red communism with stage Green American liberalism or democratic socialism. They are very different things and this is hard to distinguish unless you've studied Spiral Dynamics (which almost no one has).
</p>

<p>
	This is a common mistake conservatives make. They equate Bernie Sanders with Venezuela, which is absurdly bad analysis. Venezuela is closer to Republicans than to stage Green.

<title>How to allow emotions?</title>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15232-funbun/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="15232" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/15232-funbun/" rel="">@FunBun</a> Emotions are very tricky. What's required is mindfulness practice over them, and also getting to the bottom of why you feel the need to emote in those ways. See, those emotions are how the ego-self survives. So who you are results in those emotions getting acted out. Changing who you are will change those emotions and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are one of the most powerful tools for showing you a way past all that egotistical acting out. See, right now you don't even know what it means to be free of it. So it will be very tricky to stop acting out.
</p>

<p>
	You need to become deeply conscious that you are "doing" emotions as a means of ego survival. The emotions are there to keep the ego intact. The whole process is ruthlessly efficient and very tricky to stop because it is a matter of life and death from your POV.
</p>

<p>
	To change those emotions you will have to REALLY change. To become like a whole new person.
</p>

<p>
	How you define yourself is what then gets emoted. Take a look at how anger, fear, judgment, guilt, jealousy, etc. are serving to maintain your self-definition, your self-image, your persona. How would you have to change your self-image such that your habitual angers, fears, judgments, and guilt no longer needed to arise?
</p>

<p>
	What are all those emotions defending?
</p>

<p>
	This is a big can of worms which will take some serious work to sort out. But it's worth it.

<p>
	Yes. When the nonduality and consciousness of God gets really intense it will literally make you feel sick to your stomach. Although I've never actually had to follow through with it. But if there was food in my stomach I would have probably vomited.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes you feel like vomitting simply by realizing how full of bullshit your entire understanding of reality is.
</p>

<p>
	I have never run into problems tripping solo. That's with around 30-40 trips. But I am very careful when I trip. Solo tripping is ideal if you are responsible and careful. Bad trips will happen, but you just tough them out, letting them beat you up a bit, reminding yourself that this is how growing is done.
</p>

<p>
	Ideally you become your own shaman/guru without needing a Mommy.
</p>

<p>
	Yup
</p>

<p>
	To the ego it feels like a loss of meaning, purpose, and identity. It can feel depressing (for a time), like you are losing a dear friend. All of this is an illusion, but it will not feel like an illusion when it happens to you. The ego is going through its final death throes.

<p>
	Seems like you're creating unnecessary stories about this issue. Keep it simple instead: stay as alert and conscious during meditation as possible. If you find yourself falling asleep a lot, then do your practice after a nap. That's all.
</p>

<p>
	Calling sleep an "egoic activity" sets up an adversarial relationship with sleep, which is needless.

Just the fact that you are evaluating the fairness of life based on how much sex you do or do not get, is absurd. As if the universe cares about how much sexual pleasure you receive. No one cares about that but you. It's got zero importance at all in the big picture.
</p>

<p>
	Also notice how you assume that if you don't have sex, then some other guy will have sex instead of you. This is a horribly warped and biased way of looking at things. Most of the time when sex doesn't happen is has nothing at all to do with another guy stealing that sex. Sex fails to happen for many reasons, many of them valid. A lot of times sex fails to happen because it was not supposed to happen, because the chemistry was missing, because you two were not a good match for each other, or simply because the logistics and timing was bad.
</p>

<p>
	Nobody owes you sex. And nobody is competing with you for sex. Drop these toxic mindsets.
</p>

<p>
	Relate to the whole woman. Right now you are relating to the sex.
</p>

<p>
	The valid way of looking at things is: "Sexual pleasure has zero importance. If it happens, great. If not, oh well, I got important shit to do."
</p>

<p>
	Not necessarily. Shadow work is also important and it also depends how deep your emotional wounds are. If you had heavy trauma that will probably take a lot of dedicated work regardless of your meditation or mindfulness practice.

	Well, another radical solution is to become a yogi/saint and live a very simple and peaceful life. You could do that in any country and inspire others with your simplicity and goodness. Jesus or Gandhi-style. That would be a very powerful way to live.

<p>
	You are definitely in a tougher situtation than most self-actualizers here. It's not easy to self-actualize in Iraq, which is at such a low level of development.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe consider starting some kind of online business which would not be tied to the Iraqi economy. There are lots of opportunities but you have to get really creative.
</p>

<p>
	Don't rush too much. You will need to spend some number of years solidifying your base needs in a healthy way before you can really go to town on the top of Maslow's pyramid.
</p>

<p>
	Try to think of a long term strategy which will allow you to travel out of Iraq and be independent of the stuff going on there.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Don't feel bad. Just realize this work is extremely deep. It will take you 10-30 years of full time work to understand everything someone like Ralston has to offer. He does not lay things out for newbies like I do.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, his approach is direct, brutal, and a bit cold. You're gonna have to really work at it to understand it.

<p>
	Brutally direct teachings can be good, but they are also too advanced for most people to get results from it, and they oversimplify things too much, to the point of ignoring important complications, sticking points, pathologies, stages of development, and stuff like emotional mastery, shadow work, integration, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Brutally direct teachings often ignore the human side of this work. The pasison and the love. They can be too autistic and masculine. Some enlightened masters are basically autistic so their style will reflect that. This may not resonate well with you. Personally I prefer a more passionate, warm approach. Love has the power to transform a person like nothing else.

	That's half-true. The other half of life is seeking communion with others.
</p>

<p>
	When you become truly individual you will go full-circle and be in communion with all other individuals.
</p>

<p>
	But it is a mistake to think that life is only about being an individual because you will then create a shadow out of community.

Who is there to even say what counts as a body and what doesn't? Humans make up all such boundaries, including the boundary of human vs non-human. In other words, humans only exist as a species because we say that we do. The universe does not know what a species is.

<p>
	Truth or an absolute is not held at all. It is just what is. Isness itself is an absolute. In fact, the absolute is all there ever is.
</p>

<p>
	The present moment is absolute, but ego is not conscious of this. To be simply conscious of the present moment is the closest you can get to the absolute. Or take a psychedelic.

<p>
	1) An absolute is not a belief. You can hold a belief in an absolute, but that would be a belief, not an absolute.
</p>

<p>
	2) An enlightened person is identified with nothing. Thoughts arise, just like birds chirp when you walk outside. It's not a big deal. You don't need to kill the birds, nor do you need them chirping all the time or in any particular way. You are detached from the chirping such that it's fine either way.
</p>

<p>
	Well sure. It's not like Ken has a monopoly on this stuff.
</p>

<p>
	But as a general rule of thumb, I would never trust a professional academic's level of awakening or metaphysical understanding to be the highest.
</p>

<p>
	The wisest and most conscious people would never be academics. This doesn't mean academics don't have some valuable contributions to make. They do. But their understanding will not be too high or all-encompassing and they will miss very important facets of the big picture.
</p>

<p>
	To understand the highest stages you must look for visionaries and geniuses.
</p>

I was/am very anti-conformist like you. Nothing wrong with that. It's just a part of your personality. It might mean you should be a leader, a boss, a solo artist, or just off doing your own thing. This is great. In this case you will have to build yourself up and lead yourself a lot before others start to follow you.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be afraid to carve your own path in life. Maybe consider starting a business within a field you are passionate or curious about.
</p>

<p>
	A traditional cookie-cutter college major or job is probably not right for you. You need something more custom, more your own.
</p>

<p>
	Autistic is also okay. Just part of your personality type. You just need to find a career/purpose which leverages that.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to pursue truth is via yoga, contemplation, philosophy, self-inquiry, and/or psychedelics. So I would build experience will all the above and see how that feels for you. If you really value truth you should love all that.
</p>

<p>
	Try to think about what kind of career would be most aligned with your personality and the value of truth. It's basically that simple. Don't beat around the bush. Nail your top value.
</p>

<p>
	The core of awakening is being conscious of your true identity as Nothing. If you identify with being a body, mind, some human life, or any form whatsoever -- you ain't awake.
</p>

<p>
	What are you?
</p>

<p>
	If you have to think about it or search for it, you ain't awake. An awake person knows what they are immediately, directly.

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics breaks down around Turquoise. Ken Wilber's intergal model works much better at mapping stages above Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you cannot understand anything above Turquoise unless you become very awake and experienced with spiritual practices. Which the creators of Spiral Dynamics are not. So it is above their head.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a sign that you are moving in the right general direction, but it's unclear when an awakening will come. The awakening may still be far off if you've got a lot of energtic blocks and stuff to work through. That stuff that's coming up needs to be worked through, processed, and ultimately let go of.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you're doing okay. Keep working at it. Let the energy take over you. Act it out for a bit in a safe manner and then it should leave you.
</p>

<p>
	Some sort of intense physical activity should good for acting out the energy, like boucing around on a trampolene, etc. I think the key here is to act it out rather than trying to bottle it up. So if you feel like speaking in tongues, or flailing your arms, or yelling, do it. Lock yourself in a room with a punching bag and let it all out. Do so safely.
</p>
