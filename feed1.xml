<p>
	You've got it backwards:
</p>

<p>
	Words don't express Truth, Truth expresses words.
</p>

<p>
	In the same way that atoms are not made of words, words are made of atoms.
</p>

<title>Does spirituality make you lose motivation ?</title>

<p>
	Yes, it's challenging to rewire your motivations. At deep levels of consciousness you realize that everything is pointless, valueless, and meaningless. So there's really no reason to do anything. And this can feel depressing and demotivating for a while. But that's true detachment. You just have to give yourself time and find ways to ground yourself. You can build up some healthy ambitions over time which are based on a higher purpose, even though you know purpose is an invention.
</p>

<p>
	It can be tricky. Make sure you give yourself time. Don't make any rash decisions or actions. And trust that if you're in a depressive funk, that will not last forever. You will pull out of it with time.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest mistake people make when they are depressed is that they assume this depression will last forever. It will not.
</p>

<p>
	I think the way this problem is overcome in a tradition such as Zen is through rigorous habits and discipline. After enlightenment, the laundry. It's a grounding exercise.
</p>

<p>
	I do a mix of Pranayama 2 + the Pranayama described in Gamana's book.
</p>

<p>
	You can play around with different versions, the essence is the same. I like to visualize energy flowing up the spine to the very top of the head through all the charkas. I think the more precise your visualization gets, the better.
</p>

<p>
	Gamana says not to visualize the energy flowing up each chakra, but I feel it's more powerful to visualize it. I find that doing a detailed visualization also helps stabilize and focus the monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	Experiment around and see what works best for you.

You're still trying to reason this out intellectually, and that will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Stop theorizing and do the practices with an open mind. (Right now, your mind is not open.)
</p>

<p>
	The situation is the exact opposite what you think: Truth is all there is. There is no such thing as non-Truth. Non-Truth does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of spiritual practice is that it IS possible to transcend experience. Experience is not all there is. Experience is a 2nd order phenomena. 1st order is BEING, which requires no experiencer. Experience is a dualistic notion, which is why it must be transcended.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness, experience will become recontextualized into Absolute Being. Nothing visual will change. But a radical recontextualization will happen once the ego is seen to be non-existent. You will realize that what you used to call "experience" was really Absolute Being the whole time, you just weren't conscious of it because the ego was in the way.
</p>

<title>How to find the root of the truth?</title>

</p>

<p>
	For example, when was the last time you did a 10 day retreat?
</p>

<p>
	Do you do yoga every day?
</p>

<p>
	Do you do psychedelics?
</p>

<p>
	That's where the results are. Simple but tangible stuff like that.
</p>

<p>
	Theory -- while important and necessary -- produces very little results.
</p>

<p>
	I would tweak that to say: the goal is to be joyful with whatever is.
</p>

<p>
	So if you're feeling crummy, be joyful about it. It sounds paradoxical, and it is, but it's not.

<title>The Infinite Why</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	The why is, you want to feel good, feel complete.
</p>

<p>
	If you felt complete right now, you would not want anything.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that every day, you feel incomplete. Your entire life, you've felt incomplete. So you chase things which you think will make you feel complete.
</p>

<p>
	But it never works, because completeness is an existential insight, not a material object.
</p>

<p>
	This is because, you are disconnected from who/what you are existentially. Completeness can only come with existential understanding.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like if you imagined you should have 3 arms, but you only saw you have 2. So you'd go looking to acquire a 3rd arm to feel complete. But the counter-intuitive move is not to go chop off someone's arm and stitch it to your chest, but to realize: "Oh!!!! Duh!!! I should only have 2 arms! So everything is perfect! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" /> "
</p>

<p>
	Happiness is wanting exactly what you presently have.
</p>

<p>
	Unhappiness is wanting something you don't presently have.
</p>

<p>
	It's that simple. But not easy to really grok. The mind will not just surrender its wants. That requires enlightenment. Your very life is tied to your wants. The reason you want anything is because you want to stay alive. So the really counter-intuitive move is to say, "I want to die."
</p>

</p>

<p>
	P.S. I don't advise 5-MeO for people who have never done milder psychedelics. AL-LAD is great for newbies but still very powerful.

<title>Kriya Yoga Mega-Thread</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	For those of you into Kriya, I would highly recommend that in addition to reading the original Kriya book I suggested, you also read the books of Santata Gamana. I now prefer his more simplified techniques. It's a much more streamlined version of Kriya which I think will be even more effective. I found too much needless complexity and variety in the other way.
</p>

<p>
	Right now my technique stack is very simple:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Mahamudra x3
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Pranayama x24
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Supreme Fire x3
	</li>
	<li>
		One-pointed Concentration for 5 mins
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Eventually, with lots of practice, you should aim for something like the following stack:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Mahamudra x3
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Pranayama x36-x72
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Supreme Fire for 10-20 mins
	</li>
	<li>
		One-pointed Concentration for 10-20 mins
	</li>
	<li>
		(Bonus: Yoni Mudra x3)
	</li>
	<li>
		(Bonus: Kechari mudra)
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	EDIT: ideally, do this stack twice per day. But if you don't have that much time, at least once per day.
</p>

<p>
	Don't attempt to do this second stack right off the bat. It will not be sustainable. You need to gradually build up to it, like with heavy weightlifting.
</p>

<p>
	I think the original book I recommended is still very good as an introduction and foundation because Gamana's books are so short and thin that they do not provide enough information about Kriya to a total newbie. They are aimed at people who have already been initiated in one school or another.
</p>

<p>
	If you are strictly following the original book, that is okay. You can keep doing that if you want. Or you could switch to this more streamlined version like I decided to do. I don't like learning too many complicated techniques. But that's just me. Both ways should work in the end. It's mostly a matter of style. Although I actually think the streamlined version will end up to be more effective because it concentrates your limited time on the most powerful techniques, and less time is wasted on learning new complex techniques.
</p>

<title>What's the difference between awareness and consciousness?</title>

<p>
	I usually use those words interchangeably.
</p>

<p>
	Some teachers like to split hairs about it. I prefer not to because it confuses people.
</p>

<p>
	Suffice it to say, if you knew what awareness/consciousness was, you'd be enlightened. It cannot be explained in words.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is awareness/consciousness. But you are not aware/conscious of what awareness/consciousness is!
</p>

<p>
	If you want to become aware/conscious, place your awareness/consciousness on awareness/consciousness itself for a long time without distraction. Eventually the true nature of awareness/consciousness will dawn. And that will be enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	It does no good to ask people what awareness/consciousness is. You must observe it directly in your experience. There is the answer.
</p>

Way too much epistemic arrogance.

	What 5-MeO does, you could not imagine in the wildest science fiction movie. It basically kills you. Try for yourself and see, rather than doing armchair philosophy. It's all fun and games until you start dying.

<p>
	No, it does not.
</p>

<p>
	You are misunderstanding what consciousness is.
</p>

<p>
	You haven't actually had a direct experience of what nonduality means. You're intellectualizing it.
</p>

<p>
	I know an enlightened master who took 1000ug of LSD after his enlightenment to test himself. He was unable to tell the difference between night and day. But his grounding in Nothingness was unshaken.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness isn't a product of the brain. The brain is a form within consciousness, and as consciousness is the only thing there is, it is self-interactive.
</p>

<p>
	A rock hitting you in the head and causing a bruise is consciousness (a rock) interacting with consciousness (your head) causing a change in consciousness (a bruise).

<p>
	1) Ego backlash
</p>

<p>
	2) Sex drive is hard to just stop. In fact you bascially can't. The only way to transcend it is through lots of conscious spiritual puriffication work. I wouldn't worry about sex too much. Don't try to suppress it. Learn to accept it and to fulfill it in healthy ways.

Most work is just a waste of time and life.
</p>

<p>
	There are other options to the conventional rat race. You could join an ashram or commune.
</p>

<p>
	I have a friend who didn't want to work so he joined the Hare Krishna commune in Tennessee.
</p>

<p>
	I don't necessarily endorse that. Communes can have lots of issues of their own, but it's certainly one viable possibility. Research your options. Stop thinking inside the rat race box.

<p>
	Reality doesn't work by chance at all. It only seems that way when the linear materialistic mind cannot fathom nonlinear infinity.
</p>

<p>
	When a scientist says "chance" or "random", what he really means is: "It's too complex for me to figure out in detail. And I don't want to admit it because I know best and science knows all. So chance."

<p>
	You have to take into account that the people in solitary confinement are already very mentally dysfunction. Many of them are violent offenders and probably have mental illnesses. So solitary for them only makes things worse.
</p>

<p>
	They also do not know how to meditate or self-inquire, or that this is even an option.

<p>
	Just to be clear, I will not be sitting still the whole time like the story of the Buddha. In fact, I am sort of over the whole Zen formal sitting thing. I do not care how I sit or if I move.
</p>

<p>
	My #1 priority will be surrendering of the mind and maintaining contentration on the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	I've sort of stopped caring at this point about using formal techniques. I just sit and focus on the immediate present moment and the fact that consciousness is happening.
</p>

<p>
	I will also be doing lots of 5-MeO to definitively demonstrate its permanent enlightenment potential.
</p>

<p>
	My goal is to show that 5-MeO is the best tool for awakening, along with just sitting and surrendering. I want to demonstrate that 5-MeO can permanently rewire the "brain". It was already done so for me, but now we will take it to the next level.
</p>

<p>
	I want to accomplish what the Buddha accomplished, but using 5-MeO. Or to show that it isn't possible.
</p>

<p>
	I don't hate Mooji.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing I said was hateful. I was merely pointing out how ego distracts itself from doing the work.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you don't kiss someone's ass doesn't mean you hate him. There is a middle position. 
</p>

<p>
	Respect your teachers, but do not kiss their ass. This isn't complicated. But people love to worship people. Lots of people looking for idealized daddy figures to worship, like Osho.

	That is your naive materialist assumption.

	A beer having an effect does not prove a brain any more than Super Mario drinking a beer proves he has a brain.

<p>
	The beer is a hallucination. You drinking it is a hallucination. It affecting you is a hallucination. Your brain is a hallucination. YOU are a hallucination. Cause/effect is a hallucination.

<title>The cult of Mooji!</title>

<p>
	Of course. That's the case with most gurus, and they get off on it.
</p>

<p>
	Did you really expect people to do the hard work of pursuing their own enlightenments? Nope! The whole point of a spiritual community is to delay enlightenment as long as possible by distractions such as kissing Mooji's ass.

<title>How to be yourself, when you don’t know yourself</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Exactly. It's because you don't know yourself that you struggle to be yourself.
</p>

<p>
	What are you really? What do you want from life really? What are your values really?
</p>

<p>
	The point of the inner work is to find out.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make here is to assume that because they were born, they should somehow automatically know themselves. Nope! You gotta work for it. It takes several decades of proactive work to come to know yourself.
</p>

	Don't beat yourself up over mistakes. Reframe them as valuable lessons.

<p>
	Right here you already betray that you know what the right path is, and what the wrong path is.
</p>

<p>
	Waking up is the right path. Falling back asleep is the wrong path.
</p>

<p>
	Don't beat yourself up too much about being 100% on the right path. That is difficult and rare. In practice, you will fall off the path and slide into unconsciousness many times along the way. Maybe when you first start, you will only be 20% on the right path and 80% on the wrong path. That is okay. Just keep your eye on the ultimate vision and keep working the right path. Over time you will build momentum and your percentage will increase from 20% to 30% to 40%, etc.

<p>
	It's not practical because you are not yet conscious of what pain is. You've merely been told about this as a possibility. You haven't done anything yet to actualize it. You might as well complain that earning a million dollars is impractical simply because you've heard it's possible to earn, but you haven't bothered doing any work towards it yet.
</p>

<p>
	If you became conscious of what pain is, the pain would stop being pain.

<p>
	On this forum, we use the words "awakening" and "enlightenment" interchangeably.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever distinctions you make between those words, are your own idiosyncratic creation.

<p>
	Laughter could be a phase. It will pass with more tripping.

<p>
	But get your substance and dosages straight. Don't be relying on stuff some random friend handed you.

<p>
	More like, your emotional reactivity.
</p>

<p>
	Mood is a terrible measure of growth. Mood changes wildly. You gotta ground yourself in something more long-term and stable. Like Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	The truest measure of growth is how deeply you're grounded in Nothingness/Truth/You. Because Nothingness is the only thing which cannot be destroyed. Everything else is fleeting, including success, joy, health, wealth, relationships, career, friends, reputation, thought, or anything else. Even experience itself will end. But Nothingness will remain forever.

While most people I have asked never experienced anything like that even on the very high doses. What was the reason do you think? It seems like shrooms are taking you wherever and whatever you are ready to see.

<p>
	Of course. It all depends on one's spiritual attunement.

<title>A Universe from NOTHING?</title>

<p>
	There is no way to get it short of enlightenment. This is the heart of enlightenment. Your mind cannot create a "sneak peak" of enlightenment. A genuine nondual experience is necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Also, thinking about nothingness will not get you to Nothingness. "Figuring it out" will not work. I tried that for several years and I wasn't even close. You are not going to think your way into enlightenment.

	It's not from nothing.
</p>

<p>
	It IS nothing!
</p>

<p>
	Important difference which is lost on the scientists.
</p>

<p>
	The universe is as nothing today as it was 14 billion years ago. It's ALWAYS eternally nothing. It can never be anything but nothing. Nothing doesn't become something via time. Time itself is nothing.

</p>

<p>
	So what's the problem? Enjoy illusion for what it is.
</p>

<p>
	Why do you need it to be real? Why must you insist that in order to watch a movie, it has to be footage of actual events that took place in the world?
</p>

<p>
	You see how silly that is?
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of life is that it is a CREATION! You are creating it from scratch! The possibilities of creation are infinite. So enjoy the creation unfold. God pulled all of creation out of his ass, and in fact, he's doing it every millisecond.

	1g should be fine.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms are awesome when you do them right.

<p>
	I will explain it all at some point. I've discovered some powerful protocols which speed up meditation by like a factor of x100. Most people have never really meditated properly one hour in their life, until the machine shows you what true meditation feels like.

<p>
	I'm not going to get into that here because it's a very technical subject. The name of the machine is not the issue. The issue is the software and training protocols, which took me a month to research.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately EEG at-home training is just not accessible for but the most hardcore people. You're looking at at least a $2500 investment plus a month of hardcore research to training yourself how to use it.
</p>

<p>
	Wish it could be easier, but it isn't.

Although LSD can also get pretty hairy if you're not careful.
</p>

<p>
	For me, 5-MeO is always positive unless I don't do it on an empty stomach. Oddly, small doses tend to produce nausea for me more than larger doses. 22-25mg is the sweet spot. Lower doses can feel wonky without the full breakthrough.
</p>

<p>
	But everyone is different. People can definitely get into bad trips with 5-MeO if they don't know what they're getting into.
</p>

<p>
	One man's Infinity is another man's hell.
</p>

<p>
	I always treat each trip with mild trepidation and great care, like handling a loaded gun. I think as soon as you get cocky, it's like you're asking for a bad trip, and you will get one.
</p>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Accept yourself as you are. Surrender to the whatever the actuality is. Forget about evolving (for a while).
</p>

<p>
	This is simple advice, but hard to actually do because it will take your mind a lot of beating around the bush before it even starts to admit all the ways you don't accept yourself. "Evolution" is part of the ego's habitual agenda, believe it or not. The counter-intuitive move is to drop it.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: How To Love Yourself
</p>

<p>
	The deepest evolution comes from acceptance. But it has to be a radical, deep acceptance. A deep surrender. Which isn't something you just do by thinking about it for 5 minutes. You gotta really work at the acceptance.
</p>

Even if you slide all the way back, you're really not the same any more. You will move ahead much faster now.
</p>

<p>
	Your state will fluctuate a lot. Don't use state as a measure of growth. It's the wisdom and lessons learned that really matter, even if your state is sucky right now.

<p>
	This is wrong.
</p>

<p>
	It's very obvious what God is when once you awaken. You are it.
</p>

<p>
	Any supernatural or mystical phenomena will be lesser than awakening. There is a lot supernatural phenomena possible within the field of spirituality, but awakening will beat them all. Don't get distracted with shiny objects.

<p>
	Even a householder can plan a few 10-day retreats strategically throughout the year.
</p>

<p>
	The real question is, do you want to awaken? If you do, you'll find a way. And doesn't have to mean ditching your family.

<p>
	That's just cause you guys are taking the wrong substances in the wrong ways.
</p>

<p>
	What trippers do not realize is how important the substance is. They trip on the wrong psychedelics in the wrong ways, gets some bad trips, and take that as a message to hang up the phone.
</p>

<p>
	When you're tripping the right way, you won't be told to hang up the phone for 100+ trips. There is too much wisdom there to hang up on. The hang up happens because the mind isn't ready to handle it, and went too deep too fast.
</p>

<p>
	When I hear someone saying they took 5 trips and got the message to hang up the phone, I laugh. That's like driving 5 miles outside your city and realizing, "Welp, I guess I've seen all the world has offer. Time to head back home."
</p>

<p>
	Tripping requires persistence and patience and exploration of many different substances to find the right ones.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In regards to what?
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate Absolute Truth??? That's so profound and reality-shattering that you cannot possibly miss it. It doesn't take place at the level of knowledge or intellect or language. Instead, you can think of it as a breaking of your entire perceptual system.
</p>

<p>
	Minor insights just have a ring of truth of them. I don't know how to describe it. You feel it intuitively. But of course, you must be careful in that you could always be deluding yourself with minor insights because the mind is heavily involved.
</p>

<p>
	An Absolute insight is so deep that even as you're experiencing it, you cannot pin it down with words. It would be like seeing aliens invading from outer space. You'd be so shocked you'd be speechless, and it would have nothing whatsoever to do with a story.
</p>

<p>
	There a clear difference between a story of an alien and witnessing an actual alien invasion happening right now.
</p>

<p>
	If you're verbalizing it, it's not Absolute, it's mental. Mental insights can still be valuable and great, but they are nowhere near Absolute insights -- which are the mystical insights that are the most life-transforming.
</p>

<p>
	The easiest way to quickly get a sense of this difference is via a psychedelic. It will immediately show you the difference.
</p>

The more you try to force an insight, the less likely it tends to come. You gotta be in a relaxed state of mind.
</p>

<p>
	If you're seeking existential insights (like enlightenment) then those require enormous amounts of concentration, and they do not come as knowledge or ideas, they come as radical shift in your experience of reality.
</p>

<p>
	Minor insights are more intellectual.
</p>

<p>
	A blank mind is good. "I don't know" is also good. But it will probably take a lot longer than 1 hour to get your answer. It might take 100 hours.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta take into account that some of these answers you're seeking are MASSIVE. They aren't just an intellectual answer. They are life-transforming, so the large investment in time and energy will be worthwhile in the end.
</p>

<p>
	The insights will be much harder to get than you first expect. But they will also be much more amazing too, so it balances out in the end.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's possible to know what fear or a feeling is. It's even possible to know what all of existence is, what God is, or what death is.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 factor that determines the effectiveness of contemplation is your ability to laser-focus on the present moment without distraction for long periods of time. Imagine focus so great that you feel like you could burn a hole through a steel plate. That's what really deep contemplation requires. It's not easy to do.
</p>

<p>
	Or, the way I like to do it is let my mind wander around and randomly stumble upon insights. But this doesn't work so well for deep existential insights. It works better for minor psychological or life insights.
</p>

<p>
	No, I've probably only scratched the surface of how deep the insanity goes. I don't really care to ever experience it again. Which is why I stay away from mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	McKenna had some mushroom trips that were supposedly so terrifying he never took them again.
</p>

<p>
	I'd stick to AL-LAD or 1P-LSD. I think if you play around with mushrooms long enough, they will scare the shit out of you and probably sour your whole attitude towards psychedelics.

	Oh, BTW, 5-MeO-DMT must be done an a totally empty stomach. No eating for like 4 hours at least.
</p>

<p>
	You will be very sorry otherwise. I've noticed the trips can start to get wonky with even a bit of food.
</p>

<p>
	I've also noticed the trips get wonky for me if done in the morning.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise I never get nausea.

You literally become God.
</p>

<p>
	Your motivation should be: I want to know what reality is and why it exists!
</p>

<p>
	Tap into that deep curiosity until it's the primary thing driving your life.
</p>

<p>
	Or find some other way to frame it. If you're a God-believing person, then you could frame it as: I want to know what God is!
</p>

<p>
	Since you are young and in high school, you have LOTS of free time, especially during the summer. Stop screwing around and do a 10-day meditation retreat. You can easily get a glimpse into awakening within those 10 days. And then you'll have your motivation.

			Hey Leo,
		</p>

		<p>
			During last blog video when you took 5-meo multiple days in a row, I was wondering, what dosage did you use? did you do multiple high dosages, multiple low dosages, or slowly progress from low to high?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I've found my perfect dose now through lots of experimentation. 22-25mg rectally.
</p>

<p>
	Below 20mg is powerful, but not quite fully Infinite. 25mg is just to the point where any more would be too much to tolerate.
</p>

<p>
	At least that's for me. Everyone will be a bit different.
</p>

<p>
	On my retreat all of my doses were in the 20-22mg range. A few of the doses didn't work as planned because my plugging technique wasn't perfected yet and also because weighing out substance accurately is quite challenging even on a milligram scale, especially in a humid environment.
</p>

<p>
	I want to transition to volumetric dosing because the scale is just not consistent.
</p>

<p>
	These <a href="https://amzn.to/2r2RXpH" rel="external nofollow">micro scoops</a> should do the trick.

<p>
	They can take you to infinity, but the road will be twisted.
</p>

<p>
	Breaking through that barrier of insanity is a really important step. So long as you're afraid of going insane, you're not yet capable of contemplating the nature of reality. The Truth lies beyond insanity.
</p>

<p>
	You may want to upgrade to a less twisted psychedelic, like LSD.
</p>

<p>
	The trouble with mushrooms is, it can be hard to integrate their lessons because they can be so twisted.

	5-MeO-DMT is the polar opposite of that. You get Infinity without any twist, which is ideal. I haven't found any other psychedelic which is as clear and as direct. Most psychedelics are murky and capricious. The visual distortions also get in the way. And mushrooms fuck with your memory and sense of time in a weird way. They sort of hypnotize you.

</p>

<p>
	Use the most powerful techniques like:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Psychedelics
	</li>
	<li>
		Kirya yoga
	</li>
	<li>
		10-day retreats
	</li>
	<li>
		etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	No, no, no.
</p>

<p>
	The ego self is your physical existence. The idea that were born and are alive.
</p>

<p>
	The no-self is death of that.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that one day your life just ended. Like you were never even born. But your body keeps on living. That is enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	What people fail to understand about enlightenment is that "being alive" and "being born" and "physical existence" are just IDEAS! And once you realize they are IDEAS, all of reality will unravel and your life will collapse into Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Physical existence is not a fact. It is an IDEA.

<p>
	Yup, sad.
</p>

<p>
	That's what happens when materialism goes to its fullest conclusion. It is totally hollow, and the more successful you become, the more you start to see the truth of that.
</p>

<p>
	Most poor people are lucky because they will never get successful enough to realize just how pointless success is.
</p>

<p>
	It's very hard to believe unless you actually start to experience this phenomena for yourself. After you get all of the material stuff you most-wanted, the very next day will be the worse day of your life. So be ready for that. Have an escape plan.
</p>

<p>
	Materialism corrupts creativity because creativity is a spiritual pursuit.
</p>

<p>
	The Hero's Journey doesn't say anything about sidekicks.
</p>

<p>
	There are Threshold Guardians which lead up to the final Boss. Those Threshold Guardians are obstacles the Hero must overcome, because every journey has obstacles, otherwise it wouldn't be a journey but an amusement park ride.
</p>

<p>
	In practical terms, if your goal -- let's say -- is to kill Hitler, you're gonna face his goons before you get to him. Powerful people surround themselves with guards and delegate tasks to henchmen. If they didn't, they wouldn't be powerful.

<title>Thoughts on Peter Ralston Enlightenment Intensives</title>

<p>
	Enlightenment Intensives are very.... INTENSE. They will definitely push you hard and you will grow in more ways than one.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston's teaching style is very advanced. He doesn't coddle you at all. Most people will not get the depth of what he has to offer because he doesn't present it in an easily accessible, mainstream-ized way.
</p>

<p>
	But the Enlightenment Intensive is just dyads. You do not get any "teachings" or theory during an Intensive. It's just a week of pure self-inquiry in a very structured setting, with partners.
</p>

			I have a question for the ones more experienced with this substance.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have been experimenting with 5-MeO for a short while now with mild results only. My last try was the most I have done - 27mcg 5-MeO-DMT HCl plugged. I experienced some purging via energy shifting, but it did not feel too spectacular (very comparable to a short time of the shamanic breathing). I expected something more dramatic or powerful at this amount of 5-MeO.
		</p>

		<p>
			Should I proceed with 30 and go up?
		</p>

		<p>
			Or should I try 30  and just stick with 30 until something clicks?
		</p>

		<p>
			What could be the optimal dosing in my case?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I'm not sure why 5-MeO seems to not work on certain people. Or it works much less effectively. Probably has something to do with differences in brain physiology and also innate spiritual attunement. My guess is, not all human brains are equally susceptible to 5-MeO-DMT. I'm guessing you need to have the right structures already present in the brain which can utilize the 5-MeO, otherwise not much happens. Either you require large dosages or maybe this chemical is just not the right one for you. Do you have a high tolerance to other psychedelics like LSD or mushrooms?
</p>

<p>
	20mg of 5-MeO should produce radical shifts in consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You may want to experiment with smoking/vaporizing it. Just be careful with dosage. Smoked dosages need to be MUCH smaller. Start with something like 5mg smoked, then work up to 10mg, then 15mg.
</p>
