	I got 20 minutes of anesthesia done last week. Out cold. Zero consciousness. It was a pretty cool experience. Woke up feeling refreshed and alert. It kicked in so fast, like within 60 seconds I was out.

<p>
	But we don't need to wait that long. Many of those non-western parts of the world will raise themselves to the west's level in the next 50-100 years. China and India are on the way. Especially if the US doesn't bully or exploit them. It would be great progress for the US to just stop bullying others. Many South America countries were terribly exploited by the US, with their democratic populist governments undermined for corporate profit.

	This hinges on how deeply you realize that you are the entire horse race and every horse in the race. If your identity is limited to that of one particular horse, then you will only cheer for that horse.
</p>

<p>
	But it is possible to realize that you are the entire playing field -- that we are all ONE -- and that life does not have to be zero-sum game. By working harmoniously we can all profit.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives identify with one horse.
</p>

<p>
	Progressives want every horse to do well.

<p>
	This sounds so ridiculous once you have some God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	It's people like Pena who became tyrants and mob bosses.
</p>

<p>
	What Pena is missing is that if everyone in the world becomes feminine, there won't be a need for war. So the absurdity is that he wants men to be more macho in order to protect us from other macho men. LOL
</p>

<p>
	Masculinity: that which is needed to protect people from the savagery of masculinity.

<p>
	Yes, there's no guarantee the west will remain most advanced forever. It's an endless horse race with different horses in the lead at different times.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why it's silly to make a big deal when your horse happens to gain the lead. Your horse ain't as special as you think it is just because it is your horse.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is to cheer for one horse over all the others when you could be cheering for all the horses and the whole dynamic of the race. Right-wingers make this mistake of cheer-leading for one horse. A horse is a horse, of course, of course, which means in the end every horse dies.

	I do suspect that there is a deep spiritual blockage/neurosis within him. He is fighting with himself at a deep level. But I'm very hesitant to speak about medical issues from such a distance.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is we don't really know what's going on with him, so lets let him be. Only he can sort himself out anyways. Our opinions will not help him. And I hope he gets well regardless of his ideology.

It is objectively more advanced in many ways. The real problem is when you justify that with genetics, IQ, or some kind of innate superiority when the real reason has more to do with geographical and historical factors, and most importantly the situation is not hopeless or irredeemable. Underdeveloped countries and cultures are fully capable of advancing to the level of white western civilization. It will just take some time. So we don't need to treat them as hopeless, but rather help speed them along.
</p>

<p>
	And also, it's important to acknowledge the great qualities of non-western cultures. In some ways they are better and more advanced than the white west. India, for example, has crazy spiritual development which puts the west to shame.
</p>

<p>
	The general solution here is simple: start loving all cultures and peoples and treat them as if you will one day be born as one of them. Be ware of your own cultural biases and don't try to justify them like Molyneux does.
</p>

			Do you really think roughly half the country agrees with Molyneux? From what I’m reading he seems alt-right with a heavy emphasis on white supremacy, conspiracy theories like white genocide, Star Wars movies persecuting white people, an obsession with white superiority of IQ etc. . . Yet perhaps I’m underestimating white supremacy popularity. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I wouldn't say that half agrees with his exact detailed justifications of white superiority. I'd say half leans right-wing. And I think plenty of right-wingers have a vague sense that white western civilization is better than the rest because it has historically been so dominant and successful -- regardless of how you explain it. I think at least half the country is ethnocentric, feeling like their race and culture is the best.
</p>

<p>
	Ethnocentrism is a more nuanced thing than racism. Stage Green SJW types would benefit from making that distinction. It's easy to call people racist when really they are stuck in ethnocentrism. They are unable to see beyond their bias towards their culture and ethnicity. Such people are not nazis, facists, or explicit racists.
</p>

<p>
	I would say, for example, that my mother is ethnocentric. She def has biases against blacks and others simply given her upbringing, but not in an openly racist way. It's subtle. I think A LOT of people are like that. At least 50% of the world population. You can call such people racist but you are going to turn them against you and make them stubbornly defensive. They will never admit they are racist.
</p>

<p>
	For example, if I married a black girl, that would def disturb her. I think that is super common in the boomer generation.
</p>

<p>
	This is a tricky thing. The problem with any ideology is that it tends to radicalize people and things escalate quickly even when the original founders don't intend them to. Very tricky to regulate that. Lots of grey zone.
</p>

<p>
	Overall I'd say Molyneux was very much in the grey zone. Which makes it so tricky.

<p>
	Well, it can take a while to figure out how to use psychedelics proper for you. It requires experimentation.

	The thing about how worldviews and ideology works is that one is a true believer. One feels entitled and fully justified to one's worldview by definition.

			I think a huge part of the problem is the way YouTube functions and is monetized, everyone is reliant on keeping their echo chamber in tact or and if they stray too far in developing themselves or displease their audience in any significant way, it starts to crumble everything they've built up. And god forbid they lose some money trying to become better people in the process! Can't have that!

<p>
	I don't think he was corrupted by money in this case. He's just a true believer in his ideology. He does not recognize it as an ideology.

</blockquote>

<p>
	He doesn't see his worldview as useless or racist. He sees it as crucial and scientific/realistic.
</p>

<p>
	All this just boils down to a difference in worldview. And all worldviews are relative.
</p>

<p>
	The whole problem of racism is that racists never see themselves as racists, they see themselves as realists. It takes deep self-reflection to recognize one's own racists justifications as self-biased. This requires radical openmindedness and painful self-honesty.
</p>

<p>
	Being a philosopher, Molyneux fell into the trap of turning his philosophy into an identity which he is now committed to surviving and reproducing. It's not about money for him, it's about his pride and his identity. He's a very idealistic guy. Personally I wish him well. I think he has a good heart, although of course I don't agree with his ideas on race, IQ, and the superiority of Western European culture. He simply does not understand development psychology or how consciousness evolves.
</p>

<p>
	Banning someone like Molyneux might end up backfiring moreso than banning someone like Alex Jones. Molyneux is someone who could be debated and reasoned with. Driving this stuff underground could be like sweeping food under the kitchen rug.

	Paradox is what happens when the dualistic mind -- which divided the world -- is finally forced to confront the consequences of that division in a sea of what is otherwise an Absolute Unity.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually all dualities collapse and all divisions get unified.

<p>
	Undivided = Infinity

			Molyneux is saying YT has erased all of his thousands of videos and billions of user comments. Yet that would seem like a stupid move for YT. If YT erased it all, they would be letting go of some of their power. Suppose they had to go court proceedings. Those videos and user comments could come in handy.

</blockquote>

<p>
	As I said above, of course it can be a tool in that way. If some angry, pissy kid wants to use heavy metal music to overcome his homicidal desire to shoot up a school full of children, excellent! That is a good trade. There is value in that.
</p>

<p>
	But also consider that basically anything can be a processing tool, including violence and murder.
</p>

<p>
	Torturing kittens might help a homicidal person to not commit homicide. But that doesn't mean torturing kittens is a high consciousness activity.
</p>

<p>
	For example, when I was a kid, I liked to shoot animals with bee-bee guns. Killed some birds and things. Then one time I saw up close a bird that I fatally shot, but it wasn't dead yet. It was suffering. Seeing that made me feel so guilty that I stopped shooting animals from then on. So basically torturing animals made me a better more compassionate and conscious adult.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course not!
</p>

<p>
	You need to carefully think through what your words mean.
</p>

<p>
	"A single undivided item" << Okay, if you do that, you have Infinity. One thing. There cannot be two undivided things! You can't add together two undivided things, they must be divided to begin with for there to be two of them.
</p>

<p>
	You can add together two divided things. But what constitute "a thing" is already relative to how your mind carves up the world. The world is not made up of things. Your minds projects division on the world and calls those conceptual divisions things. But even if you get past all that, there is no guarantee whatsoever that by combining two random things you will be left with 2. There are many instances in nature where you add 1 and 1 and get something that isn't 2. Fundamentally there is no reason why you couldn't add two things together and get 0, for example. You could design a virtual reality in which 1+1=0. Or whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	And none of this in independent of a sentient being because it's all happening inside your sentience. If not, where else is addition happening?
</p>

<p>
	Even just the very notion of addition itself, is relative. After all, what is addition and how do you even understand it? Is addition something found in the outer world? Of course not.
</p>

	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If you were a donkey, 1+1=2 would not be true for you. How is this not obvious to you? 1+1=2 cannot be true for you unless you are able to think it and tell yourself that it is true.

<p>
	I agree with Bret. Technically, it may not be murder in the classical meaning of that word. Police are given lots of legal leeway in dealing with people who resist arrest.
</p>

<p>
	Of course that doesn't mean it was appropriate or that laws/regulations shouldn't change.
</p>

<p>
	Bret is just being very precise and cautious. Which most people don't want these days. They are outraged and want action. So that's the disconnect here. Both sides have their merit. It's just a matter of what you prioritize higher: precision or action?
</p>

<p>
	But this is why we have courts and why we have the right for peaceful protest. Both play an important function.

<p>
	I have. You can merge with it and still come back. It's really not different than here. Here and there, forward and back get dissolved and unified such that the material world becomes part of that pure infinite consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	And yet, it might still be possible to fully merge with it and never "come back". But I wouldn't worry about that at your stage.

<p>
	Actually, it really does.
</p>

<p>
	I say this, but it does not mean that anger is "bad" or wrong. It is what it is. But it is a low vibration of consciousness. High consciousness beings don't have almost any anger at all in them. It's been purified away and healed by the light of Love.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if heavy metal is part of your coping process and helps you to release your anger, then it can be valuable. But even so, once you release it you will want to move on to higher forms of music. A crutch is a great things when you have a broken leg. But once your leg heals, you throw the crutch away.

	Hehehe.... one day you will look back at the importance you placed on grades and test scores, and just laugh. It's complete pointless nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to really be intelligent, simply start doing the practices to explore and investigate your own consciousness. That will be true, embodied intelligence -- the only kind that really matters.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that's required to be an intellectual is to read books and contemplate the material deeply for yourself. That's it! Everything else is distraction and nonsense. If you can read and contemplate, you can be an intellectual. It's actually very simple, but it must be done consistently over years. You cannot become an intellectual in a month or a year.

			the way you're making fun of something so personal and expressive to people is counter-productive, IMO. Unlike say, political opinions, there's little immediate, explicit harm that music choices can have on the world, so it just seems kind of callous to tell people off for liking what they like. And yes people will naturally grow out of it the more they grow and develop in consciousness, but that's a choice they have to make themselves, not one that I think can be forced on people.

<p>
	I don't really judge it. Obviously I'm just expressing my own tastes. I'm not dumb enough to think that my tastes are somehow absolute.
</p>

<p>
	God loves heavy metal as much as anything else. But also, art exists are various levels of consciousness, and not all art has the same effect on one's consciousness. A horror film can be art, but it isn't necessarily good for your consciousness to fill your mind with images of horror.

<p>
	Actually, there is no difference. Who are you to say that a snuff film isn't art? It can be made artfully.
</p>

<p>
	Almost anything can be turned into an art, from murder to rape to cannibalism. It's all totally relative. But things do have consequences.

<p>
	I agree. He's healthy is many respects but also clearly shows that Green is not Yellow. A real shift happens at Yellow that takes away that toxic Vaush edge. Of course then you can't be as shocking and popular with the YT kids. That edginess stems from epistemic arrogance.

<p>
	Yes, what this tells you is that you two are simply not compatible personality-wise, values-wise, development-level-wise, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You MUST look for fit in new relationships. Not all people and personality types or value sets fit together. You must screen harder for this on the front end before you two fall head over heals in love.
</p>

<p>
	Muster the courage to admit to yourself that you two are not fit for each other, and move on. It is doing you both a disservice to try to make an unfit relationship work. It will not work. Relationships are hard enough even when you have great fit. When you have poor fit, forget about it.
</p>

<p>
	FIT! FIT! FIT! Look for FIT!
</p>

<p>
	When fit is found, the relationship flows naturally like a dance. Without fit it feels like grinding gears every week.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be a shortcut to doing.
</p>

<p>
	Reconnect yourself with a juicy vision for your life, and then just do it. It will feel hard and uncomfortable at first.
</p>

<p>
	A juicy vision is crucial, otherwise you can't even be motivated to try.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, breaking addictions is always hard and there is no way to avoid suffering. Which is why you should be careful not to get addicted to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	If you get addicted to heroin, there's no painless way out. You must go through the withdrawal.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Overcoming Addiction, which gives you the ultimate solution to addiction.
</p>

<p>
	But also! Don't guilt yourself too hard for watching self-help videos. This is still valuable stuff which is an investment in your future. There are much worse ways to spend your time.
</p>

	"Most republicans are degenerate sub-humans." -- Vaush
</p>

<p>
	I like this example of Green completely demonizing Blue republicans. You can see that his worldview is not yet sophisticated enough to appreciate why people have different perspectives on reality:

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">

<p>
	The perfect example of a stage Green trap. Even, though, of course, his critiques of racists are pretty good. He just overgeneralizes way too much. Most republicans are NOT white supremacists or fascists.

<p>
	I think there are actually some studies which show the effect heavy metal music vs classical music has on the mind/consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You ain't gonna find some blissed out yogi listening to heavy metal for a reason.
</p>

<p>
	Heavy metal will affect your consciousness in a similar way that watching horror movies might. The lower your consciousness the more you will gravitate towards dark, brash, aggressive material.
</p>

<p>
	Speaking of Red, I recently heard a report that one of Trump's favorite movies is Bloodsport, and when he watches it, he has his son fast-forward past all the dialogue and love scenes, to get to the bloody action. So it's just 60 minutes of pure bloody action. That's how Red operates. It sure explains a lot.

<p>
	I disagree with him on that. I don't buy into apocalyptic teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I could be wrong. We could all die tomorrow. But I'm not gonna live my life that way or tailor my teachings that way. I'm a long-term optimist. Of course shit will happen in the short-term.
</p>

<p>
	You also have to consider how important the timing is. Maybe Shunya is correct in some ultimate sense, but that doesn't mean it will happen in our lifetimes. What really matters is the next 50 years. If it ain't happening within that timeframe, don't worry about it. That's not your generation's responsibility.

<p>
	Since he's a socialist, fundamentally be believes capitalism is unsustainable and will eat itself at some point.
</p>

<p>
	And while that might be true, again, the crucial question is when? Maybe in 100 years. Or maybe never if socialist policies are gradually implemented over the next 50 years (which seems most likely to me).
</p>

<p>
	Of course crashes and recessions will happen.

<title>How to avoid hell on 5meo (did it this weekend)?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/50826-how-to-avoid-hell-on-5meo-did-it-this-weekend/?do=findComment&amp;comment=655311</link>

<p>
	Yeah... that's fear. You've got a lot of fear to surrender before you are able to realize the Love of that alien super-intelligence. You're not going to get stuck in hell forever. That's just one of your deepest fears, so of course it hits you hard.
</p>

<p>
	The reason it feels forced is because YOU forced! LOL. That's what 5-MeO-DMT is! When you sit down to smoke bufo what you are basically saying is: "Force God upon me." And so it is. Then the question is are you able to handle what you asked for? Are you able to chew what you bit off? Which is why moderate dosing is crucial. You can certainly traumatize yourself with God by taking  a large dose because by putting a chemical in your system you are brute-forcing awakening at the material level. And the material level tends to be ruthless. Gravity is not going to have compassion for you if you jump out of an airplane. Gravity will feel unloving in such a situation. But that's because you were crazy enough to jump out of an airplane. It's your job in this situation to ensure you have a parachute and know how to deploy it.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely try plugging it. Much gentler and smoother.
</p>

<p>
	Lower your dose. Don't be macho. This is not about who can do more. It's about finding the perfect dose for your current station in life.
</p>

<p>
	You will also get used to 5-MeO-DMT the more you do it. The first few times it just feels so alien, otherworldly, and confusing.
</p>

<p>
	Go slowly. Be patient. Play the long game. Take time to integrate. Trip only when you feel like you're ready for another dose of Truth. Sometimes I have to take months between trips. Don't be trying to copy me by doing some 30 days challenge bullshit. That's way too much. You should not be taking that as the standard example of how to trip. I was doing very hardcore stuff there because I wanted to test the limits.
</p>

<p>
	The levels are not discrete things. Think of it more like light. There are many degrees of light, from an LED to the sun and beyond.

<title>Is Time Fundamental?</title>

<p>
	Time is purely conceptual and imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	When you become conscious enough you can just stop imagining it. You can just forget it like you do an old childhood memory, until it pops back into your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Time is a conceptual projection of your mind. Don't confuse it with raw experience. Just because raw experience changes DOES NOT mean it happens in time. Change and time are not the same thing, even though we measure time by using change.
</p>

<p>
	Also be careful with thinking that reality occurs in frames or has a frame rate. It does not. There is one continuous field.
</p>

<title>Does Info Wars count as a cult?</title>

<p>
	Technically it is not a cult because it does not coerce you to be a member or prevent you from leaving.
</p>

<p>
	But effectively it is a cancer of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	The technical definition of what a cult is will have to be updated to account for this new online era we now live in, where physical coercion becomes less practical. The best kind of manipulation and corruption is not physically forceful.

<p>
	It's not false per se, it's conceptual, relative, and partial.
</p>

<p>
	There are multiple orders of reality which we can talk about. Be careful not to confuse them. Sensation is a 1st order thing. Causation is a 2nd order thing. Similar to how sand is a 1st order thing and sand castles are a 2nd order thing.
</p>

<p>
	In this inquiry we are only interested in 1st order things. So stop asking 2nd order questions.

			Yes, I mean that pain is caused by a bar (while doing squats) on my neck and while I was going up it moved something at my neck and since then I have this pain, hence me going to physio therapy, but until now no luck <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

		<p>
			Anyway, the reason why I'm telling you that is because the ego obviously wants it to be healed and obviously nobody can say if it will, but "I" have faith. However, if it is self caused and pain is pain, this pain on my neck caused the numbness in my right leg too, so somehow it is connected. By what? consciousness? Measurements such as physio therapy, what are they doing? Moving my consciousness to the right place again?

<p>
	There is only a field of sensations and whatever causal explanations you're holding in your mind are drawing relationships between these various sensations, trying to make sense of them. Your mind can draw an infinite number of causal relationships between an infinite number of different sensations.
</p>

<p>
	E.g., you get an itch on your ass and you connect it in your mind with an image of a mosquito. You are connecting sensations with other sensations and those connections are themselves sensations.
</p>

<p>
	You've got nothing but sensations of various qualities.
</p>

<p>
	These are complicated conceptual questions. Don't worry about that for now. You can explore those questions in a few months -- assuming they still remain -- once you've done some serious inquiry grounded in direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	The short answer is: everything is self-caused. The brain doesn't cause pain. Pain causes pain. Pain IS pain. Everything is itself. That's it. A = A.

<p>
	No. Fear of intimacy is not your problem.
</p>

<p>
	Your problem is a total lack of experience in dating. This is a very different problem, and actually easier to fix.
</p>

<p>
	Step 1: Stop playing victim and making excuses.
</p>

<p>
	Step 2: Watch some pickup videos about how to attract women.
</p>

<p>
	Step 3: GO OUT AND TALK TO GIRLS IN REAL LIFE EVERY WEEK!
</p>

<p>
	Step 4: Enjoy sex.
</p>

<p>
	Everything will auto-correct if you just keep going out regularly.
</p>

<p>
	No, I'm saying you are the first person who will come crying and asking for regulation as soon as your safety is threatened. You don't care about freedom. You care about your survival. "Freedom" is just a euphemism you invented for your selfishness. By preaching about freedom you are just blowing smoke up your own ass. You are terrified of true freedom. If true freedom was given to you, you would immediately reject it as you felt its gravity.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're yelling, "Give me heat! Give me heat!" so we bring you close a fire and you like it. So you yell, "This is good. Give me more heat! More heat!!!!" but we tell this is close enough. But you yell even louder, "Give me more heat!!!!!!" so we bring you right next to the fire and it burns you. Then you yell, "You bastards! Why did you burn me?!"
</p>

<p>
	Like a child, you have no idea the consequences of what you ask for.

	"Censorship" as you so sloppily call it, exists at all stages in various ways.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	All regulation, by definition, becomes political as people have different survival values and will disagree about which regulations are necessary or valid.
</p>

<p>
	Society will never not have regulation, and the regulation will always be grounded in some value set and worldview. There is no such thing as "without an agenda". You are complaining because it's not your agenda which being implemented. But any implementation of anything requires some agenda vs another.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Because Google, Facebook and Youtube are doing this, there is an asking for free-speech platforms. There are a few cropping up like Bitchute.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There will never be a mainstream non-toxic absolute "free speech" platform. The people who think Google, Facebook, and YT are violating their free speech are mostly trolls, cultists, fundamentalists, extremists, racists, homophobes, fascists, criminals, assholes, devils, and ignoramuses who cannot even understand the Constitution. So your "free speech" platform will aggregate the lowest scum on the internet and they will masturbate furiously together inside a toxic, self-reinforcing ideological echo-chamber without any adult supervision until some great evil precipitates, forcing law enforcement and the courts to shut it down. This is what happens on sites like 4chan. Although even 4chan has moderation and regulation, so it's not nearly as bad as it could be.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be any healthy social media site which goes unmoderated. This is clear as day if you have any experience running a forum. This is the whole reason that societies creates laws in the first place. If humans were responsible enough not to need laws, laws wouldn't exist. Every law is a restriction on freedom.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	All the gifs in this thread represent the realization of some aspect of awakening. The realization that you are God/Love/Nothing/Everything/Infinity/No-self/Self/other/ONE/Eternal/Absolute, etc.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="epiphany-01.gif" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed" data-fileid="24646" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2020_06/epiphany-01.gif.f6f7bf0a98d69512e361de89a01a3d70.gif" />
</p>

<p>
	Add to the list if you find some good ones.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the wide range of feelings and reactions for various facets of realization. It's not just a single insight.

<p>
	You have to clarify in your experience what "a brain" is. What does the phrase "a brain" or "my brain" actually refer to in your direct experience? For example, the phrase "Santa Claus" refers to an image of a fat bearded guy in a red costume in your mind. How about "the brain"? You'll have to be very careful here not to get lost in layer upon layer of concept.
</p>

<p>
	If you think "my brain" refers to an actual physical object in your skull, think again! That is NOT true in your direct experience. That is a conceptual fabrication because there is no physical brain present in your direct experience. If you're honest, you've probably never seen a brain in your entire life. Which obviously means your entire notion of brains is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Now, of course, this is where your mind will get extra tricky. It will say, "Okay, but if we cut open my skull there is guaranteed to be a brain in there!" But now you need to carefully notice that this too is imaginary! You are imagining your skull cut open. This is not real in your direct experience. Now you will say, "But what if it becomes real?!" << But that too is imagination! The entire notion of a future is imaginary! <img alt=":o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy@2x.png 2x" title=":o" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	You see, imagination works in multiple interwoven layers in order to create a sense of objective reality which isn't really there other than in your mind. If your mind stopped working, objective reality would disappear.

<p>
	Don't take my word for it. Take a look at it. Is there anything about reality which is objective outside your imagining that it is? How is it possible that you have ever accessed anything objective at all when 100% of your experience of life has been subjective???!!! <img alt=":o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy@2x.png 2x" title=":o" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Notice that objectivity is just subjectivity denied.

<p>
	Part of the challenge here is seeing the relativity of "healthy". You are in some sense applying a stage Green idea of "health" to stage Red. But stage Red survival happens in a very different environment than modern developed society. So even a warlord or a mobster is not necessarily unhealthy once you consider the environment they have been forced to survive in. It mostly becomes unhealthy when you put that warlord into a modern developed society.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, you don't blame a crocodile for being unhealthy when he snaps at an antelope.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's primitive and exploitative (by today's standards).
</p>

<p>
	Well... people's notion of life-transforming is of course highly subjective.
</p>

<p>
	Those who are well-suited to it will get a lot more juice out of it. Exponentially more. Like 100x more. So that can explain that.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I'm not well-suited to it. My mind is hyper creative non-stop.

	A problem is only a problem if the mind says its a problem.

<p>
	It's far more shocking than that.
</p>

<p>
	There is only one dream. Yours. You are dreaming all the other dreamers.
</p>

<p>
	This requires a yet deeper awakening to realize. It's a hard one to stomach and it boggles the mind.

<title>6 Years of Daily Meditation - My Thoughts</title>

			the benefits of mediation have become a bit overblown, it's a power tool sure, but is it life transforming? Perhaps not.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The reason you feel that way is because for meditation to be life-transforming it must be done with extreme rigor.
</p>

<p>
	If you half-ass meditation, it is 100x weaker than if you do it rigorously.
</p>

<p>
	Most people in the West are not taught to do serious meditation. They are taught meditation for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	It took me a lot of trial and error just to learn this. And I'm by no means a great mediator. But I understand what makes it powerful or life-transforming.
</p>

<p>
	Also, not all people are equally suited for it.
</p>

<p>
	To really appreciate meditation it must be done as a hardcore monk, virtually full-time. But almost no one is willing to pay that cost.
</p>

<p>
	With consciousness work you get what you are willing to put into it.
</p>

			No opportunism is not an ideology at least it is not used in this context as far as I can see.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Maybe a better way to put it is that most ideology is deep down opportunistic because its core function is to serve survival.
</p>

<p>
	Have you not noticed how the most ideological and dogmatic people are also the most hypocritical, making all sorts of excuses and exceptions for their own behavior? Why is that? Is that merely an accident or is there some deep connection between the two?
</p>

<p>
	Ideology is never some pure thing. It is always corrupted by the needs of the one who holds it because if the one who holds it doesn't get his needs met, he dies, and so does the ideology. So the paradox is that even though the ideology pretends to be rigid and pure, actually it's flexible in just the right ways that allow for the host to get his needs met.
</p>

<p>
	For example, murder is bad, but not when it comes to slaughtering animals -- because the host who carries that belief has to eat.
</p>

			I don't believe that. I think oppurtunists play the game better than people who believe what they are doing because oppurtunists studied the rules of power, persuasion. They can adjust to situations. They can make money by being leftist and also by being neo conservative. <br />
			<br />
			Of course if you believe in something you have super powers. You don't get tired like others but you may not be able to implement it into real life.<br />
			<br />
			For example guys like Fidel Castro. I think he does not care about socialism or capitalism. He can do both because he knows the rules of the game.

<p>
	In ordinary life, yes.
</p>

<p>
	But the point of these political and philosophical discussions to question certain held "facts".
</p>

<p>
	For example, it's an legit question to wonder whether such a thing as "a man" and "a women" really exists, or if it's just a socially constructed "fact" which we use because it's convenient.
</p>

<p>
	All human knowledge works this way. First we over-simplify reality, then we discover that our over-simplifications aren't nuanced enough to deal with complex edge-cases like trans people. And so we have to re-evaluate our simplistic ideas. But lots of people are resistant to doing so because they have taken on those oversimplifications as "facts", and they get outraged when they find you denying their "facts".
</p>

<p>
	Point me to a fact in the world which says, "That is man, and that is woman." You will not find such a fact within biology.
</p>

			I hadn’t thought of that. . . I also think it’s harder to call out one of your own. When Warren accused Bernie of telling her “A woman couldn’t become president”, I felt a strong repulsive reaction to it and was like “Bernie would never say that”. I took effort to step back and be open to the possibility that Bernie did say it.

<p>
	The real test for progressives is if someone like Bernie wins the presidency and then starts doing evil things. Will progressives have enough integrity and impartiality to call him out on it? Many won't because they will justify it in their minds as, "Well, he's still better than any neoliberal."
</p>

<p>
	That's exactly what Republicans do with Trump.

<p>
	Yes, but that is also easy for them to do now because they are not in a position of power yet. It serves the progressive survival agenda to rip apart neoliberals because the neoliberals are in power. But once progressives get into positions of power they will start to use double-standards to excuse away their selfish behaviors.

<p>
	The real test of your integrity is when you have serious power. It's easy to act noble and righteous when you are powerless.

			It seems conservatives do this more often, yet democrats are not immune. When Kavanaugh was accused of sexual assault, the democrats were all in supporting Blasey-Ford and how she should be believed.

<p>
	Of course. This is what I refer to as self-bias, where one's own position is held as privileged and sacrosanct.
</p>

<p>
	The lower down the Spiral, the more self-bias there is.
</p>

<p>
	The mind uses double-standards, confirmation bias, projection, denial, and justification to enforce its self-bias.

			Could one way of doing this be to think “I’m defending solid, good, American conservative values and I need to be agile to respond against crazy and evil communists”. . . That way if they come in on Wednesday and the narrative completely changes, they can rationalize it as “adapting” their strategy against the crazy and evil communists.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course!
</p>

<p>
	Once the mind paints some situation as evil and another as good, virtually any action can be justified in the avoidance of that evil situation because it's seen to be in the service of good -- which can't be wrong (by the mind's logic).
</p>

<p>
	For example, if the mind believes that it is on God's side, almost any action is justified in the service of God. And you better believe all those FoxNews people believe they are doing God's work.
</p>

<p>
	Since they see the communists are taking more and more radical actions and gaining ground, they feel more justified to take off the kid gloves and use every trick in the book to win.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I disagree with Kyle on this. Trump is fundamentally more dangerous than Bush, even though Bush might have caused more lives lost strictly-speaking with Iraq. You have to distinguish between potential damage and actualized damage. You don't know how bad Trump could get if he gets 4 more years. A nuclear war is on the table. And when we take a look at the slow Covid response, hundreds of thousands of deaths could be on Trump's hands. A war with Iran is still on the table, which could be worse than Iraq.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously Bush was a dangerously ignorant leader. But Trump is more ignorant and more dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously I have not interest in whitewashing Bush's presidency. It was a disaster on many levels, both internationally and domestically. I was extremely critical of Bush during that era.

	They are in a bubble of their own BS. In order for them to bullshit their viewers they must first bullshit themselves, otherwise they could not do their job.

<p>
	Don't underestimate the mind's ability to fool itself into believing whatever serves its survival. Self-deception covers its own tracks. They are not aware of their own hypocrisy because then they couldn't live with themselves. From their POV they are defending solid, good, American conservative values against crazy and evil communists who seek to destroy America. They see themselves as heroes and guardians of mankind. This justifies all of their flip-flopping and manipulations.

<p>
	My point is that such a question is not as easy to answer as people assume.
</p>

<p>
	The mind deliberately conflates its worldview and its survival agenda to the point where it's hard to distinguish what is authentic and what is an act.
</p>

<p>
	I would bet that he believes that Democrats are far more corrupt and dangerous than Trump, which renders the question of Trump's misdeeds and corruption moot in his mind, similar to how we might overlook Biden's problems because we see Trump as the greater evil.
</p>

<p>
	He cares about elites abusing their power to the extent that it serves his worldview and career.

<p>
	So what's missing from that analysis is that Tucker is still operating under a worldview and an ideology.
</p>

<p>
	His mind -- like all minds -- tailors his worldview to fit his survival needs, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	Believe it or not, even with everything said in the above video, he's still acting in good faith, in a deeper sense. His worldview is one in which his actions are fully justified, reasonable, true, and good.
</p>

<p>
	Of course his ideology conveniently aligns with what is good for his career.

	Most of my life I've been too busy for sex because I was so focused on my LP. If you lead a lame, boring, passionless life, then yeah -- masturbation is like all you got going for you.
</p>

<p>
	Usually, the less creative I am, the more my mind wanders towards sex. When I'm most creative, sex disappears into the background.
</p>

	Is here against peaceful protest? I don't think so. He's more complaining about extremist elements from what I remember.

<p>
	It's a deep topic. You'd have to start defining what you mean by critical theory and give concrete examples of it. Some of it will be reasonable, some of it will be excessive.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental thing that's not understood by Bret and JP is relativism. There are no objective facts per se. Reality is relative and constructed by the mind.
</p>

<p>
	If there is no such thing as absolute time, as Einstein showed, there surely is no such thing as absolute male or female. It's pretty embarrassing how a hard scientist like Bret can accept General Relativity but then insist that males and females are objective biological facts.

	The mistake there is taking universities too seriously.

<p>
	Be an independent thinker. Nothing is stopping you from taking whatever combination of classes you want.

<p>
	Be careful not to get caught up in petty social squabbles. Focus on creating your life as you want it.

	Sure, although those countries might also have less resources to mount an effective response.

<p>
	Which events?
</p>

<p>
	If you mean some of the deplatforming events on college campuses, like what happened to Bret in his classroom, yes, I think that is excessive and problematic. Stage Green can get excessively SJW-ey. But this is an exception and shouldn't cause too much alarm. Bret thinks it will cause a societal collapse, which is silly. That is just fearmongering.
</p>

<p>
	Bret wants progressive reforms, but he's unwilling to pay the cost in terms of social and cultural upheaval that will be necessary to bring it about.

	It's been pretty obvious for a few months now that America is not going to be able to suppress the virus like China.
</p>

<p>
	We are gonna have to face it head-on because the leadership isn't capable of anything else at this point and the people are too ignorant for effective coordination.

<p>
	I watched the entire interview last week.
</p>

<p>
	Overall he's a reasonable guy. More reasonable than JP. I actually agree with most of his analysis of the George Floyd case.
</p>

<p>
	But of course he's not properly understanding the "cultural marxist" phenomena on college campuses. He sees it as a dangerous force that will destroy democracy. This is the same mistake JP makes. He's conflating stage Green with Maoism. He doesn't understand that stage Green has many healthy versions which are more evolved than the status quo. Of course Green has its excesses, but he's overly focused on that because he personally suffered from it. That's understandable, but it is skewing his perspective of where society is headed. Stage Green is not the end of democracy, it will lead to better democracy. He's failing to distinguish between health and unhealthy version of Green.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, Bret's a decent guy. He simply doesn't have a high enough perspective on things. He's still stuck in materialism, which is why he can't fully understand stuff like critical theory and its post-modernist roots. This is clear when he says that scientifically, male and female are some biological objective fact. This is obviously false if you have a deep understanding of epistemology and metaphysics. But he doesn't have that understanding because he's operating on materialism and realism. He doesn't understand how "male" and "female" could be categories projected by his own mind. He takes this the metaphysics for granted, as most STEM people do.
</p>

<p>
	And Joe Rogan does not have enough intellectual chops to challenge him on these points. Which is part of the problem when Joe interviews serious people on serious topics. He's not able to properly challenge their points. He mostly just ends up agreeing with whatever they say, and by extension so does his audience. Virtually nobody in Joe's audience will be able to deeply question Weinstein's view post-modernism. Post-modernism is really challenging to understand.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, he does it in good faith. He's a true believer in his own ideology.
</p>

<p>
	He simply has a different worldview than you. If it seems that he's acting in bad faith, it's because you don't appreciate the difference in worldview because you are looking at the situation from your own worldview.
</p>

<p>
	You're missing the relativity of all worldviews. Your worldview is not "true", it's a projection of your own mind and its survival concerns. Same as Tucker.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to grow, drop your worldview and try to look at the world from Tucker's POV until you understand its appeal.
</p>

<p>
	This is your error.
</p>

<p>
	You need a way to satisfy yourself sexually because you cannot always have the stars aligned with another person, even if you are in a relationship or married. Many times they will simply be physically unavailable.
</p>

<p>
	You need to realize that there is no difference whatsoever between having sex with another person and having sex with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	A sexual fantasy is as real as "real" physical sex.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, your sex will become much more potent and satisfying once you embrace the imaginary, purely mental aspects of sex.
</p>

<p>
	Don't buy into the societal norms and judgments which gives a negative connotation of fantasy or imaginary sex.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you have sex with someone physically, that desire will still probably not get satisfied or go away. It will only be a temporary satisfaction which will turn into a new craving in a few days. So it's not that much different than masturbation.
</p>

<p>
	A true sage has sex using the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than suppressing your need desires, embrace them and allow yourself to have the love you crave. You will overcome craving more effectively through love than through denial.
</p>

<p>
	Own your sexuality.
</p>

			So, I sit there for 25 minutes and ask the following: 
		</p>

		<p>
			- who am I? <br />
			- you are the brain, of course<br />
			- how do I know that? <br />
			- well, everything you do, comes from the brain<br />
			- but RIGHT NOW, who am I? <br />
			- you are aware of your sensations and your thoughts...isn't that your brain?<br />
			- why should it be the brain? <br />
			- because it is scientific proven<br />
			- your DIRECT EXPERIENCE...RIGHT NOW...who are you? <br />
			- someone is always watching my thoughts, which doesn't speak and doesn't do anything...am I the awareness? <br />
			- could it be? <br />
			- but then who comes up with these thoughts? <br />
			- they come up out of nowhere...so is this nowhere you? <br />
			- you cannot only be the awareness cause else who is doing the actions? coming up with thoughts? who decides things? <br />
			- me<br />
			- who is this me? it can't be you because you are a thought and you are definitely not a thought<br />
			- its nothing? 
		</p>

		<p>
			That's where I'm currently stuck at. These thoughts they arrive out of nowhere. So, is this nowhere and nothing that is deciding everything? My thoughts, actions, including the awareness? 
		</p>

		<p>
			Right now when I'm typing all of this, who decided this? It's not the thought, but it's the one BEFORE the thought, which is located nowhere. Am I right? Am I on the right track?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that is a good start.
</p>

<p>
	Get very simple and direct with it.
</p>

<p>
	Try this next time you sit down for 25 mins: Take your finger and try to point to yourself. Notice carefully what the finger it pointing at. Try to clarify what that thing is. Notice, the finger never points at a brain. What is seeing the finger?
</p>

<p>
	As you do this, try to minimize thinking. Don't think about it, look at it. Clearly, thoughts come and go, so they cannot be essential to what you are. What is essentially you?
</p>

	He's just deliberately obnoxious, sexist, and insensitive. So of course many softer letfies will get turn off by him.

<p>
	No, it's not that simple. It's just one brute force method that tends to work well for clubbing.
</p>

<p>
	It does not necessarily address the root issue of your anxiety. But you gotta start somewhere. Sometimes problems auto-correct simply through exposure and practice. If you've been living in your mother's basement, going  out to lots of clubs and socializing will auto-correct much of your social awkwardness, since most of it simply comes from inexperience. Practice builds competence and confidence.
