</p>

<p>
	You have no idea if things are imaginary or not. You are just parroting some words you heard someone else say. These words are not true for you.
</p>

<p>
	For you, if we cut off your finger, you are gonna think it's a real problem. So that's what is true for you.

			Yeah, so you became God and fully conscious that you imagine stuff up. The point is how you take it is your choice, a matter of perspective. Even if I became fully conscious of how I imagine a rock, to say that it's therefore less real doesn't fit well with me. I would simply understand that imagination=reality, reality=imagination, no difference.

	You aren't getting the depth of this.

<p>
	This is exactly what late-stage capitalism looks like. The total debasement of society for success, fame, sex, and money.
</p>

<p>
	A late stage Orange society getting ready to shed its skin and move into Green. Before a rebirth a collapse is necessary. This is what rock-bottom Orange looks like.
</p>

<p>
	There's still a question of how bad this rock-bottom will get. Will it be a quick recovery or a deep, painful decent into hell? No one knows yet.

	And what did the Buddha do? What did Christ do? What did Muhammad do? What did Moses do? What did Joseph Smith do? What did Yogananda do? What did Sun Myung Moon do?

<p>
	Bodhisattvas build large movements which later become dogmatic religions and perpetuate ignorance through collective ego.
</p>

<p>
	This story has been played out since the dawn of human civilization.
</p>

<p>
	No one is to blame for this. It's inevitable given how consciousness works. You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.

<p>
	That's real. There is a fascistic element in all right-wing politics around the world and it can get out of hand if allowed to get far enough. If Trump goes down hard, he will take the rest of the country with him, that's for sure. His ego will not allow him to lose quietly or admit defeat. If he loses the election he will try to take the democracy down with him by poisoning the well.

	Ironically, Trump is probably too much of a coward to start a nuclear war. Big ego = lots to lose.
</p>

<p>
	Someone like Hitler was willing to put his own balls on the chopping block. Trump is not. He is not competent enough to be a dictator, LOL. He's a fake dictator!
</p>

<p>
	In a true dictatorship Trump would be deposed by someone more cunning, hard-working, disciplined, and bloodthristy. The only thing protecting Trump is the America bureaucracy, or "deep state" as he ignorantly calls it.

<p>
	The rock will only become less real when you are directly conscious that it is something you imagine. Right now you are just playing intellectual games. You are not actually conscious that the rock is imaginary. There is no substitute for consciousness here.

<p>
	That is not due to the psychedelic. That is because most people who stumble into psychedelics are highly dysfunctional drug addicts with lots of shadow issues and terrible karma due to abuse, bad childhoods, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Generally well-functioning members of society don't encounter psychedelics. You have to go out your way to use them due to the social stigma.
</p>

<p>
	Most trip reports I read are written by highly dysfunctional, impure, and immature people.
</p>

<p>
	Look at PsychedSubstance's trip reports, for example. Stupidity on stilts.
</p>

<p>
	Today he's more mature though. So good for him. But unfortunately psychedelics are still such an underground thing that lots of low-lives do them, giving them a bad reputation.

<p>
	What more is there to say? If you look up the textbook defintions of those terms they tell you basically what it is.
</p>

<p>
	Karma is basically the sum total of everything you imagine you and reality are -- your entire memory bank, including genetics, or whatever other thing you made up to explain why you are how you are.
</p>

<p>
	Memory, genetics, history, life story... it's all basically the same thing. These are anchors for the ego's reality.

<p>
	Some spiritual schools do. Weed and datura have been used in India for millennia by some schools. And then there is the ancient psychedelic drink called Soma, the contents of which we don't know for sure, but was likely similar to magic mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	I'll tell you this much, if the Buddha has access to 5-MeO-DMT, I don't doubt he'd use it. Are we really supposed to believe that a guy who nearly starved himself to death in pursuit of Truth would have refrained from taking a psychedelic?

			What would be interesting to know is how much easier it was for them to awaken vs someone who didn't have these experiences in their youth.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It can still be difficult for them. Plenty of spiritually gifted people have harrowing journeys to awakening (like the many classic shaman stories). So don't get the idea that being spiritually gifted makes this process a walk in the park. You can be spiritually gifted and still have a lot of shadow material to work through.
</p>

<p>
	But the biggest thing is, most people will never even attempt to awaken or know about awakening otherwise, unless they are lucky enough to stumble upon it.
</p>

<p>
	A big secret to successful awakening is have the right motivation, curiosity, and desire for it. That in itself is a very rare thing which already requires a certain degree of spiritual attunement. If you motivation is strong, the rest is just a matter of time. If you motivation is weak, almost nothing can help you. So getting your motivation straight is crucial. Which is where psychedelics can be especially helpful. People would be a lot more motivated to awaken if they had a direct experience of God or Infinite Consciousness. It's very hard to build motivation off hearsay and fairytales. It's crucial to experience God for yourself so you know that it is more real than a brick wall. It's very hard to be motivated to pursue a thing for years which you doubt is real.
</p>

			How did you come to the conclusion that most masters are spiritually gifted? It seems like a hard thing to investigate scientifically.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Not so hard really. If you ask most masters about their childhoods and how they got into spirituality, many of them will tell the same story of having spontaneous (psychedelic-like) mystical experiences, kundalini activations, astral projection, lucid dreaming, etc. when they were in their teens. Not to mention that basically all of them were deeply interested in metaphysical and spiritual questions from their youth. It is not at all an accident that they got involved in spiritual work.
</p>

<p>
	I notice this in myself. I was born a philosopher. I would estimate I have double the baseline level of consciousness of the average human and my sensitivity to psychedelics is at least double or triple that of a typical human. But even so, I never had spontaneous mystical experiences as many masters do. So I am nowhere near the top of the bell-curve of spiritual giftedness. But it is no accident that I ended up in this line of work.
</p>

	That is exactly what mediation is: worming your way up Mt Everest. If it sounds needlessly slow and painful, that's because it is.

<p>
	No, they just skirt the issue and teach to a very mainstream audience -- whoever will listen and pay. Besides, what do you expect them to do about it? They can't recommend psychedelics because 1) they have no serious experience with them, and 2) most of their followers can't access them, and 3) they would get into trouble.
</p>

<p>
	The more mainstream the teacher, the more mainstream and mild his techniques need to be.
</p>

<p>
	Do you really expect Sadhguru to stand up in front of 10,000 people and tell them point blank: 99% of you will not awaken? Why would he do this? Of what benefit is this to his followers or his organization?
</p>

<p>
	Also, when you are highly spiritually gifted from birth you have no idea what life is like for people who are not spiritually gifted. It is like living in a different reality. So easily many teachers can be dismissive of the struggles of newbies and normies.
</p>

<p>
	You have to ask yourself, what is it you want and how badly do you want it? Do you really care to know what reality is? How important is it to you that you discover the answers in this lifetime?
</p>

<p>
	See, Sadhguru's agenda is not that. He will not resolve this for you. He is busy building his organization. If you die without reaching the ultimate answers, it won't bother him one bit. But if it would bother you, then you need some sort of reliable plan for how you're going to get those answers.
</p>

It's just a way to understand reality at the highest and deepest level which would otherwise be virtually impossible.
</p>

<p>
	The psychedelic will motivate you to get serious about the work. You basically won't understand half the things I say until you do some psychedelics. And then the real work can begin.
</p>

<p>
	Most of those gurus became awakened by fluke luck, so it's not wise to count on that happening to you. You are not Sadhguru, so don't expect his results. You are you, so you must deal with the cards life has dealt you. Life has dealt most of you bad cards, so you will want every tool at your disposal to overcome that.
</p>

<p>
	If you insist on crawling up the mountain on your belly, go for it. But you could also just take a helicopter.

<p>
	So start working on building the skillset you'd need to do that job. Whatever that entails. It might start with reading certain books, or taking certain classes, or finding mentors, or just cleaning up your own life.
</p>

<p>
	If you have no vision and no motivation to build your skillset, then you're stuck until such time you do.
</p>

<p>
	What does it look like to be light worker? What kind of skillset is required? Think about the in lots of detail and then create a plan for how to move in that direction. It's not rocket science. But it will require some serous vision and dedication.

<p>
	What is the point of building a deep relationship if you two are already agreed that it will end within months?
</p>

<p>
	Don't kid yourself. What will realistically happen is that as soon as she or you hook up with your next partner, you will forget all about her and there will be no friendship left at all, since the function that this person served in your life will be gone.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget that relationships are functional, transactional exchanges. If the function is lost, the relationship will fall away. The relationship must serve both of you in some significant way. Once you hook up with someone else, this old relationship will actually become a potential threat to the new thing you got going.
</p>

<p>
	I would not waste too much time trying to maintain this thing if you are already clear it will not last. You are young and in university you will encounter a thousand other girls into whom you can invest your energy. Likewise on her end. She will almost certainly forget about you once she hooks up with her next guy.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's worth it.
</p>

<p>
	It certianly won't get you awakening, but at least it will be a gateway to more serious spiritual pursuits in years to come.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a chance at awakening via meditation you will have to do at least week-long retreats where you meditate nonstop all day long, every day. Month-long retreats would be more realistically necessary.

<p>
	If water is real, why drink it?
</p>

<p>
	Can you see that your drinking of water has nothing to do with its reality or unreality? You do not care what is real, you only care what advances your survival. If survival turns out to be unreal, you don't care. You will still keep doing it because you are addicted to survival and don't a damn about truth.

<p>
	Even if that were true -- and it certainly isn't from the absolute perspective -- so what? Do you not have a brain filled with chemicals while you meditate which causes sensory effects and changes in perception in unpredictable ways?

<p>
	What do you think makyo are?

<p>
	Taste your own medicine.

<p>
	Everything your mind thinks and sees is makyo. The Earth you think you're sitting on is makyo, and so is your brain.

			<strong>Makyō</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			The term makyō is a Zen term that means “ghost cave” or “devil’s cave.” It is a figurative reference to the kind of self-delusion that results from clinging to an experience and making a conceptual “nest” out of it for oneself. Makyō is essentially synonymous with illusion, but especially in reference to experiences that can occur within meditation practice.
		</p>

		<p>
			In Philip Kapleau's The Three Pillars of Zen, Hakuun Yasutani explained the term as the combination of ma meaning devil and kyo meaning the objective world. This character for “devil” can also refer to Mara, the Buddhist “tempter” figure; and the character kyo can mean simply region, condition or place. Makyō refers to the hallucinations and perceptual distortions that can arise during the course of meditation and can be mistaken by the practitioner as "seeing the true nature" or kenshō. Zen masters warn their meditating students to ignore sensory distortions. These can occur in the form of visions and perceptual distortions, but they can also be experiences of blank, trance-like absorption states. In the Zen school, it is understood that neither category of experience – however fascinating they may be – is a true and final enlightenment.
		</p>

		<p>
			Contemplative literature contains numerous descriptions of the perceptual distortion produced by meditation. It is characterized in some schools as "going to the movies," a sign of spiritual intensity but a phenomenon that is considered distinctly inferior to the clear insight of settled practice. In some Hindu schools it is regarded as a product of the sukshma sharira, or "experience body," in its unstable state, and in that respect is seen to be another form of maya, which is the illusory nature of the world as apprehended by ordinary consciousness.
		</p>

		<p>
			Tibetan contemplative literature uses the parallel term nyam, which fall into three categories, usually listed as clarity, bliss, and non-conceptuality. Many types of meditation phenomena can be classed under this rubric, and are generally tied to the reorganization of the body's subtle energies that can occur in meditation.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The mistake you're making is confusing psychedelics with makyo. Psychedelics are precisely NOT phenomenal distortions but pure insight, deeper than the insight of Zen meditation. The visual distortions that some psychedelics cause are to be completely ignored. The visual distortions arise with psychedelics precisely for the same reason they arise in meditation. They arise even more with psychedelics because they are like meditation x100. So you get 100 times stronger visual distortions but also 100 times deeper insight. Ignore the distortions and keep the insight, just as the Zen masters advise.
</p>

<p>
	There is no mistake in the Zen advice, but the way you are applying it to psychedelics is precisely backwards.
</p>

<p>
	You should dismiss makyo whether you're meditating or tripping balls. And don't forget, all of physical reality is makyo. So don't forget to dismiss that while you're at it <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	This can vary for different people.
</p>

<p>
	In my view yoga is signficantly more powerful because it is a bio-chemical-mechanical change of the body-mind organism. Much moreso than meditation. Yoga leads to effortless meditation by a mechanical silencing of the mind.

	No, it's not useless. But it just cannot compare to a powerful psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	It's the difference between a bow & arrow and a nuclear bomb.

	But also appreciate this: if you don't have a nuclear bomb, a bow & arrow is still damn useful.

<p>
	If you think something is not imaginary -- that's you imagining it.

<p>
	You need to practice talking more about yourself and what interests you. Push your personality out onto others. Share yourself. This takes courage and practice. Probably you feel deep down that you will be rejected or that people are not interested in what you have to say. This boils down to a low self-esteem issue.

TYT is so progressive it will take 50-100 years to enact all their ideals. The bottleneck lies elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
	You could choose to be happy that something like TYT even exists and that they got people like AOC elected. Learn to appreciate small victories. Progress is always happening, even under Trump.

				If we completely let go of the ego, experience ego death, let go of the identity, be totally selfless, become the whole universe, would we not than be: 0 work ethic, 0 dedication, 0 discipline, 0 perseverance, lazy beings? How can we create from that? How can we deal with resistance which shows up? How can we be true masters at anything?

<p>
	The ego-mind is making improper assumptions about what will happen once the ego is transcended.
</p>

<p>
	Laziness is part of the ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	Without ego-mind, you become a super-conductor for Infinite Intelligence. A ton of energy is freed up. You can be more productive than you've ever been as an ego. But also, there is no need to be productive. You can be just as happy going off in the forest to starve to death. Since nothing matters, you are free. And you don't need to control anything. Everything will unfold according to Infinite Intelligence. Infinite Intelligence isn't lazy. Ego is lazy. You don't even need to worry about what will happen -- there is a total surrender to the flow of the Universe.
</p>

<p>
	Resistance is 100% ego and falsehood. There is zero resistance once ego is purged.

	To be on the safe side, I'd lower your starting dose to 1g.
</p>

<p>
	Better to start low and go higher later than overshoot.

<p>
	You have no idea what you're getting yourself into with psychedelics.

<p>
	You don't need any books. Throw them away and focus on direct experience.

	Stage Blue people are incapable of appreciating multiculturalism and they are incapable of secular government. So there will be cultural and ethnic battle until they evolve to Orange and above. Until then there will basically be nationalism if not something worse, like ethnic cleansing or concentration camps. It will probably take India and Pakistan another 100-200 years to evolve out of Blue and leave behind their childish ethnic identities.

	Nothing is wrong with anything.
</p>

<p>
	It's just not a means of you reaching Truth. If you're looking for a public debate to reveal some deep truth to you, you're not getting what this work entails. The real work is completely internal. You should not expect anyone to prove or explain anything to you. Turn inward. Turn to direct experience.

<p>
	"How could I survive?" is a totally deluded question.
</p>

<p>
	That is ego asking from fear. A rock does not ask such a question.
</p>

<p>
	The beauty is, after awakening, you would have no problem just starving to death. It wouldn't matter at all.

<p>
	The ego cannot have emotional groundedness because all of it is false.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing there is to ground into is Truth, which the opposite of the you who wants control.
</p>

<p>
	For a calm attitude, you must die.

	To some extent, probably.

<p>
	But this is always the case. You think Bernie Sanders is not swayed by his grass-roots volunteers? Just the other day Bernie Sanders was forced, by this upset volunteers, to un-endorse Cenk. Bernie was forced into a politically correct position due to reasons of image, not substance.

<p>
	TYT is a much bigger organization than all those one-man YouTubers. TYT has like 50+ employees. A lot of mouths to feed. As they grow they will become more corporate.
</p>

<p>
	All of these issues are far too deep to be avoided through some simplistic approach like "Corporations are evil." The devil cannot be cast out so easily precisely because the devil is you. Survival forces all of us to sell out to some extent.

<p>
	What you have to understand is that if you are going to change the system in a big way you are going to have to Aikido the system's energy against itself. And of course as you co-opt the system, it will also co-opt you.
</p>

<p>
	Using money to combat money in politics isn't hypocrisy per se, it's a necessity.
</p>

<p>
	TYT is playing a game of survival, just like everyone else, just like corporations, religions, politicians, you, and me. This means chasing money to some extent.
</p>

<p>
	You shouldn't be too purist about these things because politics and survival are not a purist sport. If you want purity, become a monk and forget all about politics. Politics is pure survival. So it's gonna be dirty.

<p>
	Yes, ego was terrified because the trip was too much too fast. With plugging it's much easier.
</p>

<p>
	You also probably have plenty of shadow material to work through before you can have a full beautiful 5-MeO breakthrough.

<p>
	Giving a newbie a high dose of smoked 5-MeO is so stupid. Such a waste.
</p>

<p>
	You want the trip to be gradual and as long as possible. 4 hr trips are ideal.
</p>

<p>
	Consider something like low dose mushrooms or LSD. You will get a lot more out of it.
</p>

<p>
	People here are too preoccupied with 5-MeO. There are other psychedelics to explore which will be more beneficial for most of you. 5-MeO is for very experienced psychonauts, not newbies.

<p>
	Sadhguru is going around marketing himself. What is hard to understand about this?
</p>

<p>
	If I was invited to go on CNN and talk enlightenment, I would go. Just for the views. All interviews and debates are basically marketing gimmicks. Then again, nothing of substance would be accomplished by this.

<p>
	You have to understand that just because a candidate talks well about a thing doesn't mean it will ever get passed. Legalization of psychedelics will never pass at the national level under any candidates right now. People are not ready for it. Even if Yang wins no one will go along with him on legalizing mushrooms.
</p>

<p>
	This issue is best handled at the local level.

<p>
	Depends on how you define "depression". Technically depression is a severe negative mood which lasts continuously for 3-6 months. By this definition I've never been depressed.
</p>

<p>
	But do I sometimes experience a few days of sadness or negativity or frustration with life? Of course! This is normal. And it will happen more often if you go deep into self-inquiry / meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Meaning and purpose is something you create. That's all. No big deal. You can have it and be conscious that you are creating it.

		<p>
			A concept like this is making me extremely depressed. And it's not just a minimal depression. It's a <em>harsh</em> one.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's a deep suicidal depression where everything gets dark. It's like The Dark Night of the Soul.

<p>
	The ego cannot integrate this. Awakening to the Truth is required.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you're not ready for this work of awakening. You might just want to pursue success and basic personal development for now. The pursuit of awakening requires serious passion for Truth and emotional maturity. If truth is making you depressed, this work is not for you. You should be excited that life has no meaning or purpose. You should be excited that reality is an illusion. You need a LOVE for truth.

			in a sense, is the ego trying to control the plot that was originally assigned by the universe? but what if the ego has better options than something so tragic as an accident, so what's the point of  surrender for the true will  <span><a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="1" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/" rel="">@Leo Gura</a></span>

<p>
	The ego's delusion is to believe that one outcome is better than another. The ego is a biased perception of reality. This bias is what creates suffering. So if you want to manipulate reality your whole life, go ahead. The cost of that will be living in a self-created hell. If you want an easy and effortless life, surrender to the will of the universe and stop manipulating.
</p>

<p>
	The point of surrender is heaven and joy.
</p>

<p>
	By trying to get everything your way, you end up creating your own hell. That's the tragedy of the ego's game.
</p>

<p>
	There is no best. It depends on your style and who you resonate with. There are lots of good dating coaches and materials out there. Find which ever ones you like.

<title>Does Daygame really work?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Of course it works.
</p>

<p>
	Don't ask women if they want to be approached. No woman will ever admit that she would sleep with a guy from a cold approach because that would make her look like a slut. But she will if you attract her. Just do a quality approach.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is not a logical choice. Never ask women if they would logically date you. The answer will always be No.
</p>

<p>
	Day game is the best. The only trick is that you need a location with lots of beautiful women. That's hard to find in most cities. You need a big city. Cities like LA, NYC, and London are amazing for day game. You need a place with cafes, malls, boardwalks, beaches, busy sidewalks, college campuses, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I like day game because the approaches can be a lot more genuine and natural. And there's zero competition.
</p>

<title>Can an enlightened being fall back into delusion?</title>

<p>
	The problem here is with the overly-simplistic and binary notion of "an enlightened being". There is no such thing. There are many degrees of awakening and many different states of consciousness and many different modes of being.
</p>

<p>
	Most so-called awakened people still have plenty of impurities and their state of consciousness is not as high as it could be.
</p>

	Science will never get to Truth.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way to state Truth without it pissing off everyone in the audience. The ego-mind does not want Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The very notion that God is real will piss off all Orange people.

The difference is exactly whatever you imagine it to be. All difference is imagination itself.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between anything until you imagine there is. In this way you construct all of reality.
</p>

<p>
	The desire or need for spirits to be predictable or consistent is YOUR projected expectation, part of the scientific paradigm. Nothing says they have to fit your paradigm. They are their own paradigm.

</p>

<p>
	You can get all the technical details right and still come up totally wrong. Or you can get the big picture right and screw up the technical details.
</p>

<p>
	Chopra has the big picture right. And that's what needs to be understood.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe he is doing a disservice to science, but science is doing a disservice to God, which is the far greater sin. Science basically understands nothing about consciousness, so to act as though science is this great thing which is being maligned is a joke. Science itself is the malignment of intelligence and Truth.
</p>

<p>
	The hunter is the prey here. Sam Harris would not stand a chance in a serious discussion of nonduality.
</p>

<title>Why this Trump impeachment is a waste of time for progressives</title>

<p>
	The problem is that voters don't vote based on policy, they vote based on their own Spiral stage and cultural issues.
</p>

<p>
	The right wing is great at exploiting those cultural issues which trigger a fear for the higher Spiral stages and make people vote for lower stages.
</p>

<p>
	That is Fox News' entire playbook.

<p>
	So the joke is on Sam.

</p>

<p>
	You are speaking as though the books are some BS which don't work for anyone.
</p>

<p>
	The spiritual path is full of various problems. This is par for the course. Dealing with them is part of the path.

</p>

<p>
	Look, psychedelics are not gonna do all the work for ya. Start doing Kriya yoga every day and you should build up a natural psychedelic in your body.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is best practiced alone. You don't really need anyone else doing it with you. Just get serious about yoga and do occassional trips out of country for psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you aren't far from the most spiritual country in the world: India. Lots of gurus and ashrams there. You could travel there and get shaktipat from a guru.
</p>

<p>
	China also has many unbanned research chemicals for sale which are even better than classic psychedelics. Do your research. It only seems like China cracks down on drugs when actually they make so many research chems.
