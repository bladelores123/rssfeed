<p>
	You are EVERYTHING. The entire field of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful with your ideas of Nothingness. Whatever ideas you have of it are not it.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not about becoming convinced of something. Awakening is not a logical conclusion or a belief. It is a new state of consciousness. You need to access a new state, rather than trying to convince yourself from within your current state.
</p>

Some trips requires weeks or months of integration while others don't. There are so many factors. You gotta be patient and intuitive about it. Don't re-trip too soon if you're still not done processing the previous trip.

			true, that's why we can't just look police reform as an isolated issue. That sounds like a disaster.

		<p>
			If we want to increase training standards, I think it would also make sense to also implement serious criminal justice reform(end war on drugs), increase education spending, increase infrastructure spending, and increase spending on fighting homelessness and poverty. These policies would decrease the need for so many police officers. I think initially, there would be more upfront costs, but downstream, it actually saves money.

<p>
	Of course that's a nice ideal. But the reality is that if you want every cop to have several years of training then you're gonna have to double or triple their budgets.
</p>

<p>
	The more rigorous your process, the fewer people will become cops and the more pay they will demand.
</p>

	These things cost $$$$$$.

<title>psychedelic states through meditation?</title>

<p>
	Just because you can access a certain high state of consciousness thru meditation or yoga does not mean that you can access the full range of states that consciousness is capable of. You will miss 99% of possible states that way, and as a result your understanding of consciousness will be limited.
</p>

<p>
	There is no substitute for states. States are all there is. There are states which you cannot even imagine and which cannot be described in language or even stored in human memory once you've been there.
</p>

Obviously enlightenment is possible without psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	But enlightenment does not give you access to anywhere near the full range of states that consciousness is capable of. An enlightened person cannot access what DMT or salvia can give one access to, for example.

This is some bullshit invented by online trolls and keyboard jockeys.
</p>

<p>
	Go out, meet women, date, and follow your life purpose. Stop caring what meme-y label some fool uses to define you. To even seriously consider such ideas a "SIMP" is already an insult to your consciousness and humanity.
</p>

<p>
	You are God. Start acting like it.

			From what I've seen, It seem that next to an INTP you are also a 5 type on the Enneagram. I myself am an INFJ on MBTI and a 5 on Enneagram. Which leads me to believe that most people that connect with your teaching are either INTP's (so similar in how their cognitive functions work) or enneagram 5's (same mode in how to approach life and similar core fears).

<p>
	Yes, of course.
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing like a 2 hour metaphysical video to weed out all the non-INTPs.

<p>
	It's not that it's fluid, it's just that you're not aware of it deeply enough yet.
</p>

<p>
	It takes years of self-observation work to start to become aware of one's own personality. This is counter-intuitive because you probably expect that since the personality is yours that you should have full awareness of it. But of course that can't be the case without a lot of self-reflection.
</p>

<p>
	You don't know what your face looks like precisely because you're too close to it.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Meditation still has enormous value because you cannot be hopped up on psychedelics all the time. Psychedelics should be done rarely. Like 1-5% of your life. The other 95%+ of the time you will be sober and you'll want to boost your sober state with manual techniques like meditation or yoga.
</p>

<p>
	Regardless, you need to develop the ability to just sit and do nothing for 60 minutes straight, and to concentrate your mind for 60 mins straight. These are crucial skills to develop for anyone doing self-actualization.
</p>

<p>
	Think about it, why aren't medical records disclosed to employers?
</p>

<p>
	If someone had cancer, shouldn't the employer be told about it so that they could reject such an employee?
</p>

<p>
	You can see how problematic that would be.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I can confirm that it is certainly impossible.
</p>

<p>
	You ain't gonna reach a salvia or DPT state even after 40 years of meditation.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics states are so intense, powerful, and diverse that you will never access all of them without pumping your brain full of new chemicals.
</p>

<p>
	Through meditation perhaps you can access 1% of the full range of psychedelic states.
</p>

<p>
	This doesn't make meditation bad. It's still an important practice. But don't fool yourself into thinking you'll access a DMT, DPT, or saliva breakthrough via meditation. You will not. Also, don't confuse ego-death, samadhi, and awakening with the full range of possible states of consciousness. The range of states that consciousness can take is astounding in its diversity and intensity.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I took the 16personalities one and long time ago I had a professional evaluation done. Both results came out the same. It's very accurate for me.
</p>

<p>
	But you're not me.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes it takes a while for your personality to mature and for you to really start to understand yourself before this test becomes meaningful. Especially if you're young.
</p>

<p>
	You can try other tests too. There's hundreds of them.
</p>

<p>
	You can also try to do the process backwards. Rather than taking a test, just read descriptions of all 16 personality types until you find which one resonates with you the most. I find this more accurate than answering silly ambiguous questions.
</p>

<title>Resources For INTP's</title>

<p>
	I found this online course specifically for INTPs & INTJs:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://personalityhacker.com/intx" rel="external nofollow">https://personalityhacker.com/intx</a>
</p>

<p>
	Can't speak to whether it's worth it or not, but seems promising.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Seems like us INTPs have a unique challenge with awakening & meditation because we love to use our minds so much. It's harder for us to shut down our minds because we are so creative and philosophical.

<p>
	Since many of us here are INTPs I thought it would be useful to start a collection of resources for this personality type.
</p>

<p>
	If there is high demand, we can do the same for some other popular types.

	It's amusing how shocked people are by Trump's behavior when it is classic stage Red stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Trump behaves that way. He's a stage Red con artist, the republicans fell for it and the adults in tbe room can't make sense of how anyone can be that way or fall for it.

No need to punish him further after that unless you want him to stay a criminal -- which will come back to bite you.

	No, it's the imagination that you experienced something.

<p>
	That would be an example of doing it irresponsibly.
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention that that comes off as desperate, needy, creepy, and dysfunctional. You would never send someone you hardly know sexual messages or pictures. That is analogous to whipping your dick out at a bar.

<p>
	Then there will be entire bot-nets hired to dislike and take down content.

<p>

<p>
	It's okay to date people you meet from your job. You just have to do it carefully and responsibly. It is possible to abuse it, but not every instance is automatically abusive.

	The problem is that whoever polices Facebook will be doing it from some stage of the Spiral, which will piss off the rest of the Spiral below Yellow. It's a game that can't be won.

<p>
	3 billion people are not all gonna agree on how to police Facebook. Each faction will feel it is being oppressed or biased against.

<p>
	Awakening on camera is a challenge because it reinforces a sense of other and gets one in one's head. It becomes a distraction from going deep within.
</p>

<p>
	At some point he's gonna have to realize that he is talking to himself and that there's no one here but him to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Best of luck to him. Not easy stuff. Hopefully he isn't doing it for the views and attention.

<p>
	Your ideas of Green are overly simplistic.

<p>
	Google is a great example of highly nerdy people being Green.

<p>
	Facebook employees recently protested against Zuckerberg's policies. Clearly that protest was from a Green standpoint.

<p>
	Sitting with the suffering, feeling it mindfully, rather than trying to escape it, avoid it, hide it, distract from it, or numb it out.
</p>

<p>
	And contemplating the root of your suffering.

<p>
	I like Scarborough because he has a nice character arc. He used to be very Blue and then Orange and now he's starting to see the light of Green, but he's still got plenty of Orange and Blue left.
</p>

<p>
	His development is a microcosm of American culture's arc. The pendulum is starting to swing Green but it's not fully Green yet and it doesn't fully understand what's going on at the meta level with all the various stages, so it gets self-righteous (as Joe does above) without realizing the true complexity of issues that Facebook and Zuckerberg face.
</p>

<p>
	Blaming Zuckerberg for Facebook is a cute move, but it's don't really grasp the depth of problems we face.
</p>

<p>
	But Joe is an example of an evolved and reasonable conservative.
</p>

<p>
	Anyhow... I love to see all this evolution happening! We live in rapidly evolving times!

<p>
	It is genuine FOR HIM. It's his way.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that the process of awakening, if actually filmed, will look very different -- much more messy and incoherent -- than some interview with Eckhart Tolle or Osho 30 years after the fact.
</p>

<p>
	Now that we have YouTube, more and more awakening processes will be filmed in real-time. And they will not look pretty or be grounded like some enlightened master sitting on a pedestal. It's gonna look a lot more "real". By which I mean, you're going to see the ego-mind acting out and airing its delusions. That is real. That's part of the process. Especially for young and immature people.

<p>
	It's foolish to compare cities and rural areas because they present very different governing challenges.
</p>

<p>
	Governing a giant, interconnected city like Chicago is much more challenging than governing some rural country town like Midland Texas. Giants cities are highly diverse culturally. Small towns are mono-cultures. Simplistic policies may work well in Midland Texas but they will not scale at all to a city like Chicago.
</p>

<p>
	Taking into account complexity, diversity, and scale is crucial. Of course these are notions far beyond the heads of most right-wingers.
</p>

<p>
	And if you want to play the blame game, liberal cities are far economically successful than small conservative country towns. Most of American's economic power and taxes come from big diverse complex liberal cities. It's no accident that all the biggest cities are liberal. They have to be in order to handle the diversity and not rip themselves apart. This one point shows that liberalism is a more evolved version of conservativism.
</p>

<p>
	If Midland Texas ever reaches the population size, diversity, and complexity of Chicago, it will become as liberal as Chicago.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "real" justice. There are various forms of it depending on your level of consciousness and development.
</p>

<p>
	Blue justice is very real and important. It is stern law and order type of justice. It's more masculine in flavor. A lot of the court and legal system is from stage Blue. Police. Military. etc.
</p>

<p>
	Green justice is more hippie and feminine in flavor. It's softer, more compassionate, less authoritarian, less punishing.
</p>

<p>
	Conservative justice vs liberal justice.

<p>
	I'm not sure what they mean. People can experience Oneness in various ways.

<p>
	Personally I wouldn't call my awakenings explosions. Maybe if you smoke a large dose it could feel that way as it hits you like a freight train. My awakenings are usually more cerebral.

	Nope, sorry, you won't become a kangaroo.

If you actually ever do turn into a kangaroo that will be the most horrific experience of your life and it will leave you traumatized for months.
</p>

<p>
	Get serious about the consequences of what you're asking.
</p>

<p>
	If you could push a button right now and turn into a kangaroo, pushing that button would be scarier than putting a loaded gun in your mouth. This is not a game. This is not some cartoon where you turn into a kangaroo and it's all fun and games.

			I have a story on that topic.
		</p>

		<p>
			Last year I was training on a bike on one particular track, and I was like going extra hard coming back home. Saying: God, give me strength, the power to ride faster, I want more speed. I did it many times, always in the same place. And this year I went to ride this track once, but on my new e-bike that rides 50 km/h no problem, and I was like: "shit, my wish has been granted, just not in superhuman strength, but better equipment".

			God works in mysterious ways. <img alt="xD" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/laugh.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/laugh@2x.png 2x" title="xD" width="20" />

<p>
	When I was in full God-mode one time, I looked at a candle on my countertop and said, "Okay, let's make this thing levitate." And I tried to do the whole Jedi force levitate thing on it. Then I instantly realized, "Wait! Why am I being such an idiot?" and I just picked it up with my hand and smiled as I realize that this is how God levitates a candle. And I just laughed at how obvious it was.
</p>

<p>
	People are always looking for God in some miraculous event while overlooking the fact that EVERYTHING is a fucking miracle already.
</p>

<p>
	The way God magically eliminates hunger is by grilling a burger and then eating it. THAT is the miracle!

<title>Paradox: Infinite Love Vs The Cruelty of Survival</title>

</p>

<p>
	Of course selfishness is inherent to surviving as a finite self. That's the whole problem of existence! If you are attached to a finite form and to life, you must be selfish to succeed in that. And the reason you are selfish is because you love life and you love your ego-self.
</p>

<p>
	But this is not just some random shit that God threw into the soup for fun. The whole point of life is for selfish things to realize the joy and wonder of selflessness. Selflessness requires conscious realization. And for conscious realization of selflessness requires that you start out as selfish.
</p>

<p>
	Since reality is ultimately nondual, selfishness must equal selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way, if God could push a button right now and end all cruelty in the universe, would you happily agree to it? Yes? But that would mean that God would have to destroy all life, including you. Are you cool with that? See? So God is letting you hang around here and be cruel out of Love for you. Because you are too selfish to accept the end of cruelty. And God is too selfless to force you to be selfless. You must come to God at your own comfort level.
</p>

			Here's an interesting theory about what Connor might be trying to pull off right now. So in his video below, Connor talks about (from 6:15 - 9:15) how Jesus was enlightened and basically faked his resurrection as an epic magic trick to convince the masses into believing that he was divine. Connor also draws a lot of parallels between himself and Jesus in another video titled 'The Truth' and references Jesus' big magic trick again there. So the big questions is... is it reasonable to infer that Connor is following Jesus's playbook right now, as he described in his earlier videos? Maybe he's actually being fed through the window in his bathroom throughout the livestream fast. Connor clearly credits Jesus's resurrection stunt as being pivotal to the spread of Christianity, sees himself as Jesus, and has no qualms about lying if it results in more people awakening. So why wouldn't he do this? I could be completely wrong of course, but I think it's worth noting this because it almost seems as if Connor alluded to a master plan in his earlier videos.

<p>
	That can work, but there's a limit to how much you can bull your way through life.
</p>

<p>
	The key ingredient is CONSCIOUSNESS. The more consciously you do things, the more you will learn and grow from them.
</p>

<p>
	If you just mechanically put yourself into punishing situations that can backfire and it will certainly hit a glass ceiling.
</p>

<p>
	Pushing your comfort zone is important, but it must be done carefully, strategically, and not mechanically.
</p>

<p>
	Surrendering is an advanced teaching which most people are not able to understand or do. Usually it takes years or decades of struggle and growth to finally learn the wisdom and power of surrender. Some stage Orange macho alpha bro is not gonna appreciate surrender yet.

<p>
	YOU ARE GOD!
</p>

<p>
	God's consciousness is so high that it understands that whatever is happening is the best way it could be. Since God is Love, it can't help but love itself.
</p>

<p>
	The whole key here is for you to realize that no better reality is possible. The best reality possible has already been created. Here it is. The only problem is that you need infinite consciousness to appreciate it. Counter-intuitively, if rape didn't exist, that wouldn't be the best reality possible. It would be a worse reality. Any reality you imagine which is different than the current reality will be a worse reality. You just aren't intelligent enough to understand that because your vision is finite.

			Beautiful analogy. Yes. And this explains "synchronicities" and so on. <br />
			<br />
			The Universe is One. It's all-knowing, all-intelligent, all-powerful, omniscient. <br />
			So naturally, the Universe can communicate with itself in many - infinite - ways, human minds simply cannot understand.<br />
			<br />
			For example, the Universe may know exactly what "Bob" needs to read on this forum in this very moment in order for him to progress towards his awakening. So he is shown <em>that</em> (as a comment by "Alice"). It seems coincidental, but nothing is coincidental; everything is happening out of and because of: Intelligent Love = Your True Self = Me = God = Consciousness = Absolute Infinity.<br />
			<br />
			Ultimately, what is happening on this forum -- just as in the whole universe -- is one Self (God) talking and doing things to Itself ... <em>The Infinite Dance of The Self  ... </em>The Self has of course splitted Itself up into infinite many 'seemingly separate selves'... just for kicks... but they are ultimately all Absolute Oneness.

<p>
	Yes

<p>
	It's like playing an MMO game and realizing one day that you are not the player avatar but the entire server which generates all the avatars. The server is obviously one and contains all the seemingly-separate avatars.
</p>

<p>
	Just consider, every forum post and forum user on this website is obviously located on a single server which "knows" all the data more intimately than any one of us individual users can. In this sense the server is omniscient and all-powerful. The Universe as a whole works in a similar way.

It became so terrifying that I needed all strength I had to stop it. But in retroperspective this could just have been a normal step/hurdle that everyone has to pass at some point smoking 5-meo. I do not want to believe that I went deeper than you so if possible please tell me that this supernova thing is a regular awakening you already passed on your way to enlightenment and that there are much higher awakenings to achieve!

<p>
	I have no idea what level of consciousness you reached. Only you can know that.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe in this case you should lay off the 5-MeO and double-down on manual practices. 5-MeO can only take you so far.

	Endlessly hitting the pipe is not sustainable.

<p>
	Don't confuse a physical act with your value judgment of it.
</p>

<p>
	The value judgment is your mind's projection.
</p>

<p>
	Rape is not inherently "bad". Your mind is necessary to say that a thing is "bad". Notice that your mind is doing this.
</p>

<p>
	About the same speed as swapping a mag in a pistol.
</p>

<p>
	They have more expensive models which can fire 2 shots before reloading. But that's overkill. The laser sight alone should be enough to spook most people away.
</p>

<p>
	And if you miss, you can still always taze point blank.

<p>
	I don't think it leaves lasting damage unless the darts maybe hit you in the face.
</p>

<p>
	But certainly if the cop is running at full speed and he gets tased, he will take a nasty tumble on the pavement. Could possibly crack your skull open.

<p>
	I have a profressional police taser that fires wired electric darts with a laser sight.
</p>

<p>
	If those darts land, the taser is active for 30 seconds. You will be totally unable to move for 30 seconds and the trigger can be pulled again for another 30 second dose as many times as the battery lasts, and if the darts miss their target the taser can still be used at point blank range.
</p>

<p>
	Profressional tasers are pretty awesome!
</p>

<p>
	In the video you can see the darts flying at the cop.
</p>

<p>
	If any of you creepers get out of hand, your ass is getting tased for at least 30 seconds! <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />

			So Leo, what is the highest dosage of DMT you have tried in one hit yet?<br />
			<br />
			10 mg? It's nothing. <br />
			<br />
			You know, science has made it absolutely clear that DMT is physically <u>and </u>mentally 100% safe for normal sane people, at least <40 mg. (We have studies where they give regular ppl DMT in the doages of 20-40 mg IV).<br />
			 
		</p>

<p>
	The dose number is irrelevant, and varies greatly from person to person. Stop treating these numbers as an objective or absolute standard -- that is dangerous. These numbers are purely relative.
</p>

<p>
	I have done DMT trips which would traumatize a normal person. And I've certainly gone above 20mg.
</p>

<p>
	I am at least 3x more sensitive to psychedelics than a normal person. So 20mg for me is more like 60mg for you.
</p>

<p>
	It's not the dose that counts, it's what you're able to become conscious of.
</p>

<title>How is that the Ultimate Love aka God doesn't give a shit when a kid is raped?</title>

<p>
	Evil only exists IN YOUR MIND!
</p>

<p>
	The Universe cannot know what "evil" is for the same reason that it cannot know what up or down are. There is no up or down without some relative reference frame.
</p>

<p>
	Just as in outer space there is no up or down, in God-consciousness there is no evil.
</p>

<p>
	In order to create evil, there needs to be a relative reference frame of an ego-self. Evil is not baked into any action. The mind has to project it onto the action in the same way that the mind projects up and down onto the Earth. The Earth does not have an up or down and it does not know itself as being rightside up or upside down. Any angle the Earth is at is right. Now translate this to how Absolute Love works.
</p>

		<p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	My words are not so simplistic.
</p>

<p>
	When I say you don't need external sources to fill you that is speaking from the absolute perspective.
</p>

<p>
	From the relative, practical, everyday perspective, yes, loving parents, teachers, friends, environment, etc are very important.
</p>

<p>
	But the ultimate solution to not having gotten the love you needed is to take responsibility for that and to start giving it to yourself, which also includes attracting more loving people into your life. Getting love through an intimate relationship IS self-love! You are creating and attracting that relationship and you are deciding how the love flows in it. You can create that relationship as part of your plan to fill yourself with love.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious and developed you become, the more you'll be able to directly fill yourself with love without needing external sources. But on your way to this ideal you can certainly rely on external sources to strategically fill yourself up.
</p>

<p>
	Stay away from salvia. It is gonna get you in trouble.

	God is infinite, so it cannot not love all parts of itself, including rape. God is so conscious of itself that it knows rape cannot be rejected but must be accepted. God cannot escape what is.

<p>
	This is why psychedelics must be used very carefully and dosed carefully.
</p>

<p>
	You dosed too high and you didn't leave enough time for integration.
</p>

<p>
	You have to know your own limits and treat each trip seriously.

			If materiality is a complex hallucination then why you can't control it? You said that once you become aware that you are God, you should be able to do things which seem to be impossible from a human perspective. Do you think that once you become selfless, you will be able to transcend all the limits and do what? Hope that you don't say "do nothing".

</blockquote>

<p>
	The paradox is that once you become fully conscious you cannot do anything at all because what you realize is that reality is Absolute Love, and nothing can be done other than that. It's a total surrender. God is a tautology and cannot be otherwise. The paradox is that even though God is omnipotent, it cannot be anything other than what it is. When you are totally selfless there is no need or desire to change the world because it is Perfect.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense you cannot control reality because on a deeper level you're creating it as it is in the first place. There is confusion in you -- due to lack of consciousness -- about how you are creating the entire thing.
</p>

<p>
	It's like this: you are kicking yourself in the nuts and wondering why you cannot stop it. Because you are too busy kicking!
</p>

<p>
	The ego thinks that it can gain power and manipulate reality more. But actually what happens is that to gain power you must surrender ego until you have surrendered it so fully that all your desire to control reality has disappeared and you then fully realize that whatever is happening is already Your/God's Will, so the only thing you gotta do is Love yourself exactly as you are.

<p>
	Exactly. You can't expect a drunk person to behave in a sensible or safe manner.
</p>

<p>
	But it's worse than that. The cops in this case didn't know if this guy was merely drunk or on meth or any other drug or just plain psycho. Which makes him unpredictable and more dangerous with a taser in hand.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, if you are so drunk that you wrestle with cops, steal their taser, and fire it as them -- yeah -- you're playing with fire. Of course if he was sober he probably wouldn't have made such a bad decision to resist arrest.
</p>

<p>
	And yet people demonize psychedelics.

<p>
	You can transcend certain human limits by becoming more conscious. The limits are not really human, they are limits of your consciousness. Smoke some DMT and the limits disappear, at least for a few minutes.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Finite form, fear, attachment, selfishness, and lack of consciousness are what prevents you.
</p>

<p>
	Every finite form will have less than full omnipotence. That's the just the nature of a finite form: it can't do everything equally well, so it's limited.
</p>

<p>
	You can elevate mind over matter by become more conscious, but there are still limits as dictate by the form your mind takes. For mind to become totally unlimited it must become totally formless, which means you must surrender all attachment to any kind of bodily form. At which point you cease to exist on any material plane.
</p>

<p>
	There is a strict trade-off between form and power. The more "material" a thing is the more constrained it is. Materiality is nothing but constraint. But if you define the material as real, then the most powerful things are, by your own definition, unreal. But that's because you've confused materiality for reality.
</p>

<p>
	The most powerful things are purely abstract and immaterial. That's just the natural cost of power.
</p>

<p>
	Full Omnipotence must be totally formless -- as only it can give rise to all form.
</p>

<p>
	A rock isn't omnipotent precisely because it is limited to doing what a "rock" does. For a rock to become omnipotent is must stop looking and behaving like a rock.

			Is there any way to tell when the freebase has dissolved, i.e. is there a visible change in the substance during the conversion with vinegar that I should watch out for?

<p>
	Freebase should fully dissolve in a few drops of vinegar if you stir it around a lot and break up the clumps.

	Salvia and DMT is a gnarly combo. That's some serious mindfuckery. I'm too terrified to take a full hit of that.

<p>
	You are not understanding. The "void" is right here. Everything is Void. Form is Void too. Life is Void too.
</p>

<p>
	Stop holding "void" as some blank space that's separate from the material world. Void is Absolute which means it's here now.

<p>
	NOW is Infinity.

<p>
	Death is Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	There is no difference between life and death other than whatever you imagine it to be.
</p>

<p>
	God cannot die. But it does change forms. So if you attach to any one form, it will appear to you like you die.

<p>
	Do you understand that if a cop gets successfully tazed, he is now immobilized and the criminal can just grab his gun?

	Tazing a cop is a very serious and dangerous offense.

<p>
	I have no fixed schedule. Sometimes daily, sometimes not for months.
</p>

<p>
	Right now I don't feel I need any more tripping.
</p>

<p>
	When I trip these days, it's mostly for science, just to see what will happen on some new chemical.

	Improper neurochemistry.
</p>

<p>
	Just because Arnold can bench press 700 lbs does not mean you will be able to unassisted.

<p>
	Those yogis have incredibly rare neurochemistry to begin with. That's their secret. They are NOT NOT NOT normal people.

<p>
	Thinking is useful. Your problem here sounds like fear based thinking, which can be problematic. Although even that is sometimes warranted.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you are just doubting yourself and apprehensive about a new situation -- which is normal.

<p>
	The police seem professional and decent in the above video.
</p>

<p>
	The guy seems to have really startled them because there was no sign he was going to resist arrest so hard at the last second. It's like the arresting cop gave him too much benefit of the doubt. He expected to handcuff him without any resistance.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, in a rapidly escalating situation like that, as the cop you don't know if the guy not only stole a taser but maybe a gun from the other cop. From the comfort of watching the video at home it's clear he only stole the taser, but he could have stolen a gun. That's not easy know within a few split seconds while you're tumbling on the ground. In these kinds of situations cops are often dealing with a lot of unknowns.

<p>
	One hit is enough for me with some substances. All depends. Most people will probably need multiple hits.
</p>

<p>
	Vaping is quite imprecise. You just eye ball it and take small hits to get a feel for how much you can handle. Since you can easily always take another hit there's no need for big doses.
</p>

<p>
	I would start with like 10mg of a substance. And even that I wouldn't fully hit. Start with a mild inhale at half strength.

<p>
	I have tried the GVG a lot and don't like it. Oil pipe is much better. The DMT will run down into the bottom of the GVG and it gets all nasty. Needlessly complicated. GVG is basically unusable without herb. And I don't want to inhale herb smoke in my lungs.

<p>
	The "sex" is metaphysical so to speak.
</p>

<p>
	It comes from dissolving boundaries between things like you, your grandmother, and a mouse.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize those boundaries were always imaginary, they start to melt into one another, and you realize that as true Love.

	My dad had a good amount of Red. It was a really fucked up way to grow up in ways most people could not believe.
</p>

<p>
	If I told you stories of all the shit my dad did, it would be more outlandish than a movie and your jaw would drop to the floor.
</p>

<p>
	Americans, for the most part, don't appreciate what stage Red is. You have to go to a 3rd world country like Russia to witness it. Americans would call it sociopathic, and yet it's just how people at Red schedule their day.

	Dude was driving while intoxicated. Could have easily killed another driver or pedestrian. You can't let DUI's run free. And you can't let intoxicated people run around with tazers.
</p>

<p>
	If that cop let this guy run away with his tazer, and then he tazed some innocent lady with it, you would also want to hold the cop responsible: "How could you let a criminal run away with your weapon?! What kind of cop are you?"
</p>

<p>
	Just as a thought experiment, what do you think would happen if you went up to a cop at the mall and starting licking the gun attached to his hip? I wouldn't be surprised if I was shot for doing that.

<p>
	Yeah, Red is tricky. I think most of us simply don't have enough direct experience of it because our societies and cultures have evolved beyond Red so much by this point.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to understand Red you're gonna have to have some direct interactions with Red people and sub-cultures. Reading about it is not enough. We lack reference experiences for what we read about Red.
</p>

<p>
	In developed societies Red is experienced very early in the childhood and teenage years. A developed society simply doesn't tolerate Red behavior much beyond that. Adults will quickly shame the kid into Blue because dealing with Red is too much hassle.
</p>

<p>
	If your parents beat you, it's probably because you were acting too Red and they wanted you to be Blue. So literally they beat the Red out of you.

<p>
	Oil/crack pipe is so easy. You just put the powder on the pipe and very gently apply a blowtorch lighter to it while slowly sucking in. It takes a few tries to learn how much heat is too much. If you apply too much heat it will not vaporize but burn black on the glass. In which case wash it out with a q-tip and try again applying less heat to the glass.
</p>

<p>
	You should buy a few oil pipes in case you burn one out. And I would use a different pipe for each different substance because there will be crystal residue left over.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever you successfully vape, it will create crystal vapor, which quickly cools and turns into white crystal, like frost, on a glass surface.
</p>

<p>
	After a few days of trial and error you will get the hang of it.
</p>

<p>
	Because Love is Infinity and Infinity is the only thing which can exist.
</p>

<p>
	Love is an Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	This must be directly realized.

<p>
	With any vaped substance you gotta go extra easy on the dose. It's easy to take a big hit and get in over your head.
</p>

<p>
	Baby doses. Since vaping is so fast, it's easy to redose if you undershoot. Impossible to undo if you overshoot.

			Yet don’t you think there are also some contexts in which fairness can be increased without huge investment? For example, perhaps there are police and justice systems in parts of the U.S. that are only 80% fair. Going from 80% to 85% fair would be much less expensive than going from 94% fair to 99% fair. For example, there could be accountability and oversight measures that are inexpensive.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, definitely. We gotta look for the low-hanging fruit in police reform, like body cameras, banning choke holds, etc. Some stuff is cheap and easy to do.

<p>
	Actually, it is, if you are calling for a 6-man squad of police per incident.
</p>

<p>
	You have to think through the practicalities of your policy proposals.
</p>

<p>
	If you steal a cop's taser, expect to be shot. Not so difficult. As for Floyd, that was an excessive case and some kind of reform is necessary there.
</p>

<p>
	No choke holds is probably a good new policy. It seems that lots of people have breathing challenges so choke holds end up killing people unnecessarily.
</p>

<p>
	The key here to find practical policies which will solve the problem without costing too much time or money.

If you prefer vaping now, do you still plug harmala first? How many mgs are you vaping? and (if) using the harmala before vaping, how long do those trips last? Mine was the typical 10 minute trip.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, I vape without harmala. I haven't noticed that harmala changes the vaped trip too much. But I haven't tried doses of harmala beyond about 60mg. A large dose of harmala might make the trip very potent, so be careful.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	That's the job! Police deal with such situations every day. You cannot have police walking around in packs of 6 just because some big guy might overpower one of them and steal their taser. In such a case, you kill the guy. Policing is not free. It costs a lot of energy and resources. Police need to use their energy efficiently. They cannot coddle every idiot they encounter on the street. If you waste the police's resources, yeah, get ready to have a gun pointed at you.
</p>

<p>
	There is a trade-off between fairness & the energy required to deliver that fairness. And this equation has diminishing returns. Which means that to go from 99% fairness to 99.9% fairness might require a tripling of energy invested. Are you willing to triple your sales tax in order to get that 0.9% of extra fairness? These are the real-world decisions that politicians and police chiefs must make. It's a delicate balancing act.

<p>
	That can work when there is huge demand for that industry, as there is with programming.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, many of those people are probably miserable because they are not suited to be programmers, they did it forcefully.

Seeds are crap.
</p>

<p>
	You plug the harmala mixed with a few drops of vinegar + light coconut milk. Wait 30 minutes. Then plug the DMT mixed with a few drops of vinegar + light coconut milk. The larger the dose the more it will sting.
</p>

<p>
	To get a breakthrough this way you'll need quite a lot of DMT. 50mg+ or even 100mg+
</p>

<p>
	But the trip will last much longer.
</p>

<p>
	I actually prefer to vape DMT because it stings the ass too much given the needed dose.
</p>

<p>
	But you can experiment around and see which you prefer.

	That's a big part of it.

			Part of the problem with that is an unfair justice system. What if I’m in a situation in which I have a prior drunk driving arrest and received a disproportionately severe prison sentence. Cops <i>and</i> the justice system are against me. If I get caught drunk in my car, the consequences are disproportionately stacked against me. I’m not going to get a fair shake and I could go back to the damn prison for this. That factors into my response.

<p>
	Yes, of course. I totally get that. If you're in poverty you cannot even afford to pay a speeding ticket.

<p>
	More regarding that Rational National video:
</p>

<p>
	We have to recognize that those who are given power are likely to abuse that power. So like the Standford prison experiment showed, people put in positions of power over "criminals" are likely to abuse it. That is a problem deeper than racism.
</p>

<p>
	How do you stop cops from wielding power in a bullying way when they are upset? That's not easy to do. Remember, cops are human and they have egos. If you piss them off, yeah, they will crack your skull just for the satisfaction of it.
</p>

<p>
	It's very difficult to train a cop to be totally fair and neutral, especially under stressful conditions. Being a cop is harder than being a judge. A judge can be neutral in the comfort of his office and high chair. A cop has to be on the streets dealing with punks and idiots all day long. Imagine a judge trying to be neutral while the defendant is spitting in his face and calling him names. The courtroom has the luxury of decorum. And even so, judges are human too and they are not always neutral.
</p>

<p>
	The general problem here is: How do you train highly conscious people who are given lots of power? Any given cop or judge can only be as good and uncorrupted as his level of consciousness and development allows.

<p>
	I agree that police culture is very self-serving, as we see with police unions who defend their own unconditionally in a self-biased manner. This should be reformed and improved.

<p>
	Any predatory behavior must be reformed. But I think 99% of cops cannot be reasonably called predators or kidnappers. But then again I ain't black and my experiences with police are not from the ghetto. How it works in a ghetto, I dunno.

			Within the context of the analogy of the vase and our perfect omniscient infinite singularity being at the <em>center </em>of a field, with the non-omniscient aspects being around the periphery.... does this imply that in all aspects (both omniscient and non-omniscient) we are subject to some degree of geo-spatiality? I'm familiar with the concept of <em>Dimension Zero </em>as a good way to reference non-duality, but how would that fit into a dimensional model with a center and a periphery? Or is this just a limitation of the analogy?

<p>
	Space in that model doesn't represent space, it represents Selflessness/Love/Consciousness.

	Your separation from the Godhead is not a function of space or time, it's a function of lack of consciousness and Love, or fear.

			Another thing I've struggled with is a similar paradox of the omniscient infinite God seemingly existing under the authority of a <em>time dimension. </em>For example, we know that infinite consciousness is timeless consciousness,  yet the process of moving between the various states of non-omniscience up into the unified non-dualistic state would imply a certain animation.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The Godhead exists outside of time, Eternally. So the Godhead literally spends Eternity in its formless state. And then at any point in Eternity it can imagine time and thereby limit itself to some time-bound dimension.
</p>

<p>
	Since God is unlimited, there is literally nothing preventing God from doing anything it wants instantaneously without a how. If God has to ask itself, "But how can I do this?" that would be a limit! The whole point is that when you realize you are God, you realize that no how is necessary.

<p>
	Actually this correct.
</p>

<p>
	You can't appreciate policing until you've personally done some form of it.
</p>

<p>
	The thing about policing that most people don't understand is how relentless it is. The volume is very high. You are handling borderline cases all day long for years. After arresting hundreds of people and dealing with thousands of devils it makes you jaded. You can't handle each case like a snowflake. There are too many devils to treat each one like angle. Devils take advantage of your generosity. You don't shoot one of them, and he stabs you in the back with a knife.

			One police reform could be to use a shoot-to-wound policy  in some cases like these.  With an officer behind him, and knowing the suspect didn't have another weapon (they already frisked him), I think he could have shot him in the ass or leg.  Cops in the US are always trained to shoot-to-stop the threat; usually multiple shots in the chest or back (which often results in death).  This would of course require more marksmanship training. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I agree this could be improved upon. Like, don't shoot in the chest or head unless he has a loaded gun. But then again, if a criminal was shooting a tazer at me, I would shoot him in the chest. That's a serious threat. It is the height of arrogance to steal a cop's tazer and use it against him. You thereby practically leave him no choice but you shoot you. That tazer was the cop's humane tool to arrest you with.

			You're not questioning WHY policing is tough in the first place enough. WHY is policing tough? WHY do people steal tasers? WHY are people committing crimes? WHY are they resisting arrest?
		</p>

		<p>
			There are countries out there where policing is 1000x easier than it is in the US. Policing is way easier in Denmark, UK, Australia, Canada, etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			Policing is easier in those countries because the culture is different, social norms are different, there's less systemic problems there, people have their basic needs met more, people are treated better, people are more aware, the laws are different, consequences are dealt with different, more holistically, more compassionately, less harshly, more focus on rehab than solidary confinement, etc.
		</p>

		<p>
			Most developed countries have banned guns... and that's a first start for the US. The fact that you guys have guns is unacceptable and way below your standards as a country.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, policing is hard everywhere.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, it's harder in the US because we have a unique culture here and a different level of development.
</p>

<p>
	Policing will always be harder in less developed countries and countries with higher economic disparity. Western Northern Europe is more egalitarian with less economic disparity and slightly higher level of Spiral development.
</p>

<p>
	Europe doesn't have a huge legacy of slavery to deal with.

<p>
	There is an ennegram personality type which loves to get its sense of purpose and meaning from enforcing laws and justice. These types of people love to do work such a military, policing, bouncing, security, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's a valid personality type. Such people serve an important function. They are not bossy per se. They actually value loyalty and they can be healthily expressed. But if they become unhealthy then it can look very ugly as abuse or tyranny.

<p>
	There is a big difference between conscious polyamory vs cheating. If you both agree to be in a polyamorous relationship, no problem. Then it ain't cheating. The problem happens when people fool themselves about polyamory when what they secretly want is to use polyamory to find the best mate they can and then ditch all the rest. It's not a true commitment to polyamory, it's a manipulative and selfish ploy.

	Yes, I get your point. I definitely believe that happens. If you were black you would have more suspicion overall.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That is correct because blacks have lower incomes than whites on average and there is going to be a correlation between lower income and violent crime. Of course this is not because they have bad genetics. It is because of the legacy of slavery. But nevertheless, it is what it is. If you go to a poor white neighborhood vs a rich one, you will be more suspicious of the poor one.
</p>

<p>
	All these subtle associations are baked into our collective culture. Which is why it's so hard to eliminate systemic racism.

<p>
	That is the meta-challenge in this whole issue. Striking that balance between corrective action without losing objectivity is hard to do. Over-correction and under-correction are both risks. People can be too complacent or too proactive. Burning down a Wendy's over this case is an example of over-correction.
</p>

<p>
	To have a smoothly functioning system requires exquisite balance -- which requires the intelligence and consciousness of God.

			So my questions are:
		</p>

		<p>
			1) If I was a black male in this same situation, what are the chances that a police officer would have treated me this way. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, there would be more suspicion of you. Because humans make stereotypes and have unconscious biases as part of survival.
</p>

<p>
	A cop is not going to treat a nicely dressed guy in a business suit the same way he will treat a guy who slurs his speech and wears a hoodie. Call it unfair, but such stereotypes are going to be a part of policing.
</p>

<p>
	For example, when I police this forum, I have to manually approve each new member who signs up. I manually check their IP address. If their IP address is from India or Bangladesh I ban their account in about 50% of cases because 95% of spam accounts are from India or Bangladesh. Sometimes I ban Indian people by accident who aren't spammers. Is this fair or am I being racist? You can say I'm being racist, but it's just a fact of online policing that 95% of spam comes from India. I would be a fool to treat accounts from India the same as accounts from the US or Europe. Indian accounts must clear a higher bar. This is just the harsh reality. Nothing against Indians other than their fucking endless spam. Why do Indian's spam so much? Because they have dirt cheap labor costs and they speak English better than most underdeveloped countries with cheap labor costs, and they have decent internet access.
</p>

<p>
	If I treated Indian accounts the same as US and European accounts, there would be a lot more spam on this forum. It would also cost more energy. But it would be more fair. So there is a trade-off between security, energy, and fairness.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically, if you want very tight security AND high fairness you need to invest A LOT more energy into the policing system.
</p>

<p>
	When a drunk person is shooting a taser at you, the last thing you'll be thinking of is how you should let him go and re-arrest him the next day at his home.
</p>

<p>
	If this his how arrests worked, everyone would resist arrest all the time.
</p>

<p>
	If a cop gets tazed, his gun is free for the taking.

	I don't agree with Shunya's apocalyptic messages. I would ignore that part of his teachings.
</p>

<p>
	Bad stuff has always happened throughout human history. Nothing new here. Humanity gets through it and keeps going.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Valid is a relative notion, of course.
</p>

<p>
	Do whatever you want. But in this work/teaching we have some standards for what is acceptable and what is not.
</p>

<p>
	Depression is something that can be reversed in many cases. So it's worth suffering through it.

	There can be valid reasons for wanting to end one's life (like in the case of chronic or terminal disease, or torture).
