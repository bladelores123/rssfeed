<p>
	That's cute, but don't conflate relative and absolute domains.
</p>

<p>
	Dating is a relative domain and there are certainly winners and losers, just like in chess.
</p>

<p>
	It's not always a zero-sum game, but it's also not a game in which everyone goes home with a trophy.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, it seems that way TO YOU because you're looking at it from a woman's survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	It's like I am trying to teach a wolf how to hunt rabbits, and -- as rabbit -- you enter the chat and start talking about how hunting rabbits is unnecessary and troubling to you, without any concern that the wolf will starve if he is not taught how to hunt. The wolf is not going to survive on carrots.

<p>
	This is why I don't discuss attraction with women. You're not interested in understanding it. You're interested in your agenda.

<p>
	You should distinguish between equality under law vs cultural norms and values. We will never has equality at the cultural level, and that's being asked for. What's being fought for is equality under law and equality in material treatment, like in the workplace.

<p>
	You can treat a boy and girl differently, but with equal fairness. You don't have to dress the girl in a tuxedo to treat her fairly.

			The socialization skills part of pick up is awesome but that's obviously not the main objective. Plenty of women sleep around but sleeping with someone you barely know is far more risky to a woman than it is to men. You give men advice here on how to get the kind of women who are willing to do that, not how to get a long term girlfriend.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	ALL women are willing to sleep with a cool guy. This is not some special slutty subset of women.
</p>

<p>
	There is not difference between what attracts a woman partying at a club with her friends vs a women sitting at home reading books and shopping for groceries once a week. The only difference is that the one sitting at home is harder to reach. And to get her during that narrow window at the grocery store requires serious practice in settings where women are plentiful.
</p>

<p>
	It is not possible to get a long-term girlfriend without first attracting and sleeping with her.
</p>

<p>
	I highly recommend long-term girlfriends. But before that happens, the man has to build himself up and fix his internal weaknesses and learn how to attract women in general.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No. The city is irrelevant and the kind of woman is also irrelevant.

			In your experience honestly, are the woman you encounter psychologically, spiritually healthy?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I rarely meet psychologically or spiritually healthy humans.
</p>

<p>
	Most women are nuts. But hey... you can't live without them, and you can't live with 'em. So here we are <img alt=":P" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/tongue@2x.png 2x" title=":P" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, this conversation is not for you. You are looking at it from a woman's self-biased perspective -- obviously. But a man has a different survival agenda than you. The man has no obligation to explain or justify his survival agenda to women, just as women have no obligation to do so to men. Most women have zero interest in understanding a man's survival agenda. So unless you're truly interested in that, its best to stay out of this discussion because it's really not about helping you, it's about helping guys.
</p>

<p>
	If we were having a discussion about helping women find men, the tables would be turned.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake is trying to impose your survival agenda on the opposite sex or expecting the opposite sex to surrender their survival agenda to suit you. Women are not going to surrender their survival agenda, and nor will men. It's called "game" for this reason. It's a sophisticated game of chess and both sides are playing to win.
</p>

<p>
	If you act like you're not playing this game, that's precisely the game you're playing. Whether you know it or not, or admit it or not, the game is being played.
</p>

<p>
	This is a grey area. This forum is certainly not going to allow sex trafficking, but this case of escorting is more like sex work rather than sex trafficking. And the legalities of such things will vary from country to country.
</p>

<p>
	We'll allow this for now, but don't let it get out of hand or into illegalities.
</p>

<p>
	As for whether it's a good plan at all... well...

	In online dating the opening line is largely irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	Put all your energy into upgrading the quality of your photos.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do well with online dating, hire a professional photographer for $500 to do all your photos.
</p>

<p>
	Your photos MUST look awesome.

			This is what I'm trying to understand:
		</p>

		<p>
			1) It is often mentioned that I create the Universe, the Moon and every creature and object and every hair on my body, and infinite amount of forms etc.  
		</p>

		<p>
			While at the same time you say that:
		</p>

		<p>
			2) "When you are aware of it, you create it"
		</p>

		<p>
			So something exists ONLY if I am aware of it?
		</p>

		<p>
			Did I create an alien in some other Galaxy? 
		</p>

		<p>
			But I am not aware of the alien or any Galaxies.
		</p>

		<p>
			I am only aware of a thought about an alien. Which means that the alien exists only as this particular thought? 
		</p>

		<p>
			But why then mention other creatures, objects, planets, humans and everything else that I am not aware of and say that I created them?   
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Like a video game renderer, you create whatever is on screen right now.
</p>

<p>
	So right now you are creating the thought of an alien in some other galaxy.
</p>

<p>
	But if you get on a space ship and fly to that galaxy which you imagine, and meet that alien which you imagine, you will be creating that galaxy and that alien.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you see is PRECISELY what you are creating. Nothing more, nothing less. Precisely!
</p>

<p>
	Well, that works too. Approaches are approaches. It does not matter where, when, or how many.
</p>

<p>
	The mall can be a great place to approach.
</p>

<p>
	My first success came from a mall approach. It was a thing of beauty. Hot 25 year old girl was walking and talking to her mother on the phone. I stopped her and told her to hang up on her mom. She did. We talked for 5 minutes. A few days later we got a coffee and she slept with me. Amazing girl.

<p>
	It's not ironic at all.
</p>

<p>
	Taking 100% responsibility is the foundation of our work here.
</p>

<p>
	My criticism of libertarians is that they shirk collective responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	You must be both individually responsible AND collectively responsible. That's what I teach. Just one or the other is not good enough.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, in this work I expect you go above and beyond what any normal person is willing to do. That's the key to becoming an amazing human. You must be willing to do what others are too lazy to do.
</p>

<p>
	I am giving advice for guys who are SERIOUS about becoming great. If you're happy with mediocrity, my advice isn't for you.

<p>
	Roosh is dumb.
</p>

<p>
	Gives pickup a bad name.
</p>

<p>
	A perfect example of a stage Blue/Orange reactionary against Green. Culture war drivel and toxic masculinity.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately this kind of ideology is common within the pickup community. The ideology that can come with pickup techniques is like mind cancer. It's utterly selfish and self-biased. Classic devilry and projection.

<p>
	That's exactly why practice is crucial.

<p>
	Any time a girl makes eye contact with you like that, you MUST open her. She'll be super receptive. Her giving you that eye contact is like her writing on her forehead: "I will date you"

			This is the most disillusioning thread until now for me. Leo advice is to ask out hundreds of girls a month (!), tell 'em if they are not in line you'll spank 'em like she you little sister (I'm a single Child, so I don't know what to say about that).

<p>
	Strawman much?
</p>

<p>
	You don't ask out hundreds of women like some needy creeper. You SOCIALIZE with them and some of them get attracted to you because you're a cool guy who isn't sitting in his mother's basement jerking off to Jordan Peterson.

<p>
	When you are aware of it, you create it.
</p>

<p>
	Feel the hair on your arm. As you feel it, you create it. Awareness IS creation.
</p>

<p>
	You are not aware that you are creating Everything. Because you're asleep.
</p>

<p>
	All I'm saying is that you CAN become aware of how you designed it. Obviously you're not anywhere near that degree of consciousness right now. Which is why is seems so outlandish to you.

<p>
	Of course developing internal pathways is crucial to our work here.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics by themselves will never be enough.

<p>
	Obviously one can get a boner naturally rather than by using Viagra.
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean that all states of consciousness can be accessed "naturally". This is not at all a safe assumption.

They are not about seeking pleasure.
</p>

<p>
	There is no internal mechanism that you can open which will give you the consciousness possible on 5-MeO-DMT, for example. But you can only understand that by doing lots of it. Which of course you will refuse to do because you think you've got reality figured out.

<title>Libertarian Examples Mega-Thread</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/51170-libertarian-examples-mega-thread/?do=findComment&amp;comment=667666</link>

<p>
	This clip here has a nice explanation of the problems with unlimited free speech which libertarians love to argue for:
</p>

<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo ipsEmbeddedVideo_limited">
	<div>
		<iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mynWhShRHBk?start=269&feature=oembed" width="480"></iframe>
	</div>
</div>

<p>
	So what libertarians don't understand about unlimited free speech is that it gets exploited by clever egos to actually take away the free speech of others, leading to an overall reduction in free speech for all.
</p>

<p>
	This is a microcosmic case of the larger macrocosmic problem with unlimited freedom as I discussed in my libertarian video. The paradox of freedom is that unlimited forms of it lead to oppression. Which is what libertarians refuse to understand.
</p>

<p>
	Vaush's analysis here is precisely correct as he understands the counter-intuitive ways in which freedom can backfire. The guy he's arguing against does not understand this because he isn't taking into account the clever and radically selfish ways in which ego will exploit his unlimited free speech. And of course the hypocrisy is that even that guy must admit of restriction on speech in case of threats of violence.
</p>

<p>
	Also notice how the libertarian guy does not have an understanding of relativity when Vaush pushes him with examples of white people being offended by the presence of black people in a restaurant. To a libertarian this does not compute because he naively thinks that white people cannot legitimately feel oppressed by the mere presence of a black person. Which of course they can and do!
</p>

<p>
	Vaush does a brilliant job of breaking this guy down.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a thread about empathy for rape victims.
</p>

<p>
	The context of this thread is: "female celebrities getting away with sexual misconduct"
</p>

<p>
	The reason this happens is because the standards for female sexual misconduct are very different -- and SHOULD be very different -- than the standards for male sexual misconduct. Because the male can be much more forceful about it.
</p>

<p>
	It baffles me that you guys are having a hard time understanding this. It would help if you set your woke-scolding aside for a moment and try to understand why I communicated what I did.

<p>
	Most men get raped by other men.
</p>

<p>
	I was not minimizing male on male rape. I was minimizing females raping males. Which is such a silly and rare thing that it isn't worth talking about in the context of males raping females.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying it cannot ever happen. I'm saying it's absurd to act as though men face anywhere near the same threat from females as females face from males. This is a difference by a factor of at least 100x if not 1000x.
</p>

<p>
	So spare me your SJW woke scolding and outrage.
</p>

<p>
	The average male faces zero threat ever of getting physically restrained and raped by a female.
</p>

<p>
	I have never in my life worried that a woman would rape me. Like zero chance of that. I worry more about getting hit by lightning. Yet if I was a woman I would have those worries frequently throughout my life. Which is why women hitting on men is not such a big deal.
</p>

<p>
	You misunderstand what equal means. You are taking it too literally which leads to absurdities like: "That means a man should be able to talk into a woman's dressing room" or "A woman should be allowed to walk around on the sidewalk topless."
</p>

<p>
	Equality means fair treatment while respecting gender differences.

<p>
	Cougar on the prowl.
</p>

<p>
	The difference is, she can't rape that guy.
</p>

<p>
	Although given how heavy she's going at him in that video, I do wonder... <img alt="O.o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/blink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/blink@2x.png 2x" title="O.o" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	See, if a guy gets raped by a woman, he will most likely enjoy it.
</p>

<p>
	Not so the other way around.

	Old news.
</p>

<p>
	So what?
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's real. But the devils at the CIA have no idea what to do with it.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	75 approaches per month?? That's why the guy isn't getting his dream girl. You gotta be doing 5x-10x more.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously not every girl will be attracted to you. It makes no difference. If you do 750 approaches per month, you will get many girls attracted to you.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to tell when a girl gets attracted. Hook-point is usually reached within 5 minutes of an approach.
</p>

<p>
	And yes, the quality of your approach matters A LOT. Girls are attracted to PERSONALITY. If you can't display your awesome personality within 5-10 minutes, you'll lose lots of girls who would otherwise get attracted.
</p>

<p>
	If you approach 1000 girls, you will attract at least a few stunners, and many average girls.
</p>

<p>
	PUAs are not lying to you. They get crazy results because they go out so much and approach so much and they got crazy good game that will take you years to develop. I have befriended many PUAs, not professional coaches but ordinary guys. And they get laid a lot.
</p>

<p>
	A knew a newbie virgin guy who moved to Vegas and started doing PUA. He was had average looks and average height. A bit chubby. He was a total virgin. Within a few months he slept with something like 20 or 30 girls. It was amazing. Of course Vegas is uniquely good for pickup, but still. Even for Vegas that's a lot.

	You can't have anarcho-syndicalism with nuclear weapons. It's nonsense on stilts.
</p>

<p>
	The state needs to be at least large enough to manage nuclear weapons and prevent private actors from getting their hands on them. And that's just one out of thousand problems.

	When you create breakfast, who is creating it? What is creation?

<p>
	You have no problem admitting you created breakfast, but you deny you created the Universe.

	He's simply not conscious of what God is.
</p>

<p>
	God-realization is a very advanced stage of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You have to go really deep to realize that you are God and that you created the whole universe.
</p>

<p>
	Just because someone is a Buddhist does not make him God-realized.
</p>

<p>
	The only proper answer to the question of "Does God exist?" is: YOU ARE GOD! DUMMY!

	As with all things, there is criticism from above and from below.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that most criticism I see is from below. But that doesn't mean it cannot be criticized from above.
</p>

<p>
	Feminism is a very diverse cultural movement. Are there some excessive aspects to it? How could there not be?

			This is so true. Any tips on how put up with this tendency and effectively deal with that?

		<p>
			I've personally wasted a lot of time learning various technical design skills, or different marketing tactics while the most effective strategy was to focus on one or a few things, master them and then leverage it. Thats probably not as damaging as becoming a Nazi or getting into other kind of toxic ideology, but still, holds you back a lot if you're not aware of it happening

			It seems shame can be effective in some contexts. Yet can it also be counter-productive in some contexts? A lot of people aren’t overtly racist, yet they have a vague sense of ethnocentrism and are ok benefitting from systemic biases that are in their favor. Sometimes, it seems calling it to their attention without any shame is more effective.

<p>
	Sure, this requires what the Buddhists call skillful means.
</p>

<p>
	But it is the nature of conservatives to resist progress. So it will be hard to move them without stepping on a few toes.

			Youtube does have an OBVIOUS agenda when it comes to the trending tab. It favours traditional media and late night shows, while often neglecting independent content creators.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Obviously.
</p>

<p>
	This is not because big media is paying them. This is because YT wants to serves up more authoritative sources and smaller fringe independent creators are less trustworthy. YT can safely assume that CNN or MSNBC will not serve up racist content. YT cannot assume that about small creators who could be Neo-Nazis or the like. Even with PewDiePie vs Jimmy Fallon, YT can trust Jimmy Fallon a lot more than PewDiePie not to say some racist or false shit.
</p>

<p>
	The bigger YT gets, the more mainstream it must be because mainstream is the only way to sustain the largest viewership numbers.
</p>

<p>
	Google's search algorithm does the same thing with websites. Google heavily favors mainstream authoritative sources vs no-name indie blogs. Because mainstream sources can be trusted as having some kind of journalistic standards.
</p>

<p>
	If Google did not do this, it's algorithm would quickly be gamed by spammers, hackers, and the scum of the internet.
</p>

<p>
	Most normies have no clue how scummy the internet is. Google serves up a highly sanitize version of the internet after filtering out 90% of the scum.
</p>

<p>
	Google's search algorithm literally has a list of the top 1000 sites that Google hand-selected as authoritative sources. And this list seeds the authority of the entire internet basically. Any links coming from those 1000 sources determine the authority of every webpage on the entire internet.

<p>
	Nothingness is imagining everything. Just like how a white sheet of paper holds whatever is drawn on it.
</p>

<p>
	You can have all sorts of mystical experiences of aliens, out of body, astral realms, chakras, etc.
</p>

<p>
	But all of it is happening within Nothingness. All of it is Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	No-self is a higher degree of consciousness than an OBE or a formed mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	The highest realization is that you have no form whatsoever. There is no reason to get out of your body because you were never in your body to begin with. You are omnipresent. You cannot go anywhere because you are already everywhere and everywhere is nowhere and nothing.
</p>

			Feminism, pick up, socialism, conservativism, MRAs, right extremists... At some point you gotta ask yourself what's the point of using all these terms though, when there are so huge diversity in how these words are used and perceived. Like, if I tell a crowd of 20 people that I'm a "feminist" or that I do "pick up ", and those 20 people have totally different definitions/views on those terms, wouldn't it then be better if I said " I'm a huge believer of equal rights and I feel like we still have a long way to go" or " I really enjoy approaching girls and getting to share my authentic self and by that giving both her and my self a pleasant experience which could potentially lead to something more"? It would obviously make the communication more clear at least.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Congrats! You've discovered the trade-off between brevity and clarity.
</p>

<p>
	"I'm a huge believer of equal rights and I feel like we still have a long way to go" << even if you said that every time instead of "feminism" you'd still be stuck with a lack of clarity. Now you'd have to define "equal rights" and "a long way to go".
</p>

<p>
	In fact, you in order to get full clarity you would have to define every single term in your entire worldview/mind. But you'd be dead before then. And still, people would misunderstand you because they lack your reference experiences used to define the terms.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is a slippery beast. Which is why this stuff gets argued about for ages without resolution.
</p>

<p>
	It's called a rabbit hole for a reason. It works like a funnel. You start watching Joe Rogan talk about comedy. Then you watch him interview Jordan Peterson. Then you go to Jordan Peterson's channel. Then you start getting anti-SJW content. Then you start getting racist stuff.
</p>

<p>
	You're not understanding how this works.
</p>

<p>
	YT isn't doing it. YOUR MIND is doing it because every mind is interested in validating its existing worldview.
</p>

<p>
	YT is just a mirror of your own mind. It serves you up what your mind wants to watch.

<p>
	Being nice to minorities is a systemic and cultural issue more so than a personal one. No one cares if you're an asshole as a person. The issue that people care about most is systemic inequality and bullying, which is baked into the culture.

<p>
	Actually, demanding conservatives not to be dicks to minorities has little collateral damage.

<p>
	It's reasonably health and necessary. I don't see how else you do it. It's not like conservatives and racists are gonna admit wrong-doing or change their way of life unless some pressure is applied. The whole point of conservatives is that they will resist ANY change whatsoever. That's their game. And then they justify it with whatever excuses sound good to them.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes to get a bully to understand that his bullying is bad, you must give him a taste of his own medicine. The problem is that a bully doesn't understand that his bullying hurts others until he feels the hurt reflected back on him by those he hurt.
</p>

<p>
	So when a racist is publicly shamed or deplatformed, it hurts him, and then he gets a taste of what it feels like to be bullied as a minority.
</p>

<p>
	See, racists used to be a majority who bullied the minority, but now they are starting to become the minority who gets bullied by the majority, and this scares the shit out of them. It creates an existential crises of them.
</p>

<p>
	The tables have turned and the racists and devils are getting hoisted by their own petards. That's the problem with devilry -- it always boomerangs.

	That's precisely why there needs to be a stronger federal government with much better funding and strict protocols in place as soon as a new virus hits.

<p>
	This virus is directly the result of libertarian-like approach to government: let's just do nothing and the free market will fix itself.

	It sounds nice in theory, but in practice leads to mass death and economic horror.

<p>
	So by your logic, in the Civil War, the North was fascist against the South.
</p>

<p>
	And during the Civil Rights movement in the 60's, black people were fascist against white people.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the whole trick with building a good society is that selfish people have to be forcibly restrained or at least shamed from being selfish because a selfish person will not do so of his own recognizance.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes equality gotta be forced.

At this point it's basically become the default method of information exchange for so many millions of people that the corporation has become incredibly powerful in terms of controlling what people's eyeballs see. I mean I guess they're doing a good enough job as it is, but at the same time some sort of regulations could ensure that it doesn't abuse its power for one malicious end or another?

<p>
	Yes, of course all massively popular social media platforms need government regulation and oversight.
</p>

<p>
	The feds could set up an "online media court" which handles cases like that of YT vs Stefan Molyneux or Alex Jones, where an impartial and well-educated panel of judges adjudicates whether community guidelines were violated or not, and the whole thing can be aired live on YT for all citizens to see. This would be a huge win for liberal democracy, free speech, and civil rights.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to ban people as long as the process of getting banned is fair and transparent, and the person has an ability to defend himself against strawman arguments or being taken out of context.

			But let's say, you need some material ammunition for your ego to at least be able to believe in the story. Trump and Pence are both fueling their delusions by cherrypicking whatever reinforce their perception of themselves in their environnement. They are helped and validated in their pretenses by cultural narratives, a lifestyle, an entourage, a community and supporter base which helps support that claim.

<p>
	YES! That's precisely the function of the culture war they love to wage.
</p>

<p>
	You see, when your whole identity is a socially constructed fiction, you need to fight very hard to make sure your cultural hegemony remains in place, otherwise your whole reality unravels.
</p>

<p>
	The culture war is just a proxy war to save the dying conservative self-identity.

<p>
	It's more complicated than that. Because conservatives still fundamentally believe that being a man or a woman is "real", "objective", and "scientific" while other identities are not.
</p>

<p>
	The real issue here is how many trans and gay teens end up killing themselves because they get bullied, harassed, and mocked for their sexual identity/preferences.
</p>

<p>
	If conservatives stop mocking and bullying trans and gay people, then there won't be a big issue about pronouns and the like.
</p>

<p>
	See, this is being framed by conservatives as if trans people are oppressing them, when really it's mostly about conservatives who want the freedom to bully trans and gay people.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, government is going to take away your freedom to bully and mock people of different sexual identities. Sorry. You're not gonna win that battle.

<p>
	Nudity is also against TOS for obvious reasons. Millions of kids use YT.
</p>

<p>
	YT does not promote racist or sexist stuff. It is against their TOS and YT just banned a bunch of big racists channels. Moderating such stuff is very challenging. Overall YT is doing a good job, considering how many thousands of new videos are uploaded each minute to YT.

<p>
	Youtube is a technology platform. It doesn't "welcome" anything. It is not Youtube's job to micromanage the content that people upload. All that YT asks is that people don't upload hateful, racist, sexist, toxic, violent, illegal stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Joe Rogan has one of the biggest audiences in the world. It's his responsibility to vet for dangerous clowns and ideologues. Most of Rogan's audience is not even on YT.

	Society has NEVER EVER been consensual. That's what you misunderstand.

<p>
	You are whining about the inconvenience of isolation when your ancestors had to die in war to defend your ability to exist.

	You seem to not understand how community works. Your community will force you to do WHATEVER IS NECESSARY for the community's survival. Welcome to Earth, human.

	Libertarians are not some morality superior heroes. They are naive and deeply selfish people acting out their own personal survival, which happens to include surviving the libertarian mind virus which has taken them as host.

<p>
	The libertarian is not a hero because he does not understand the consequences of his philosophy. So this simply makes him a fool. Like a child playing with a loaded gun. The child is not a brave hero for doing so.

	All fear is imaginary. But the problem is, when you are afraid it does no good to tell you that there is nothing to fear, since if you accepted that you wouldn't be afraid in the first place.

<p>
	Conservatives should legit fear the loss of their worldview, identity, and the ensuing existential crises that will come with that. Of course all of this is good stuff, but they don't want to hear it.

Open borders are more problematic than some progressives imagine. Covid-19 clearly shows the importance of border control. Although Americans are so stupidly libertarian that they infect each other worse than any outsiders would.

<p>
	Undermining of one's identity is never benign. It's a matter of life and death. Which is why conservatives are so triggered by it.
</p>

<p>
	Something as innocent as admitting that a human could legitimately consider herself a unicorn is actually a very troubling thing for the conservative ego-mind. If she could be a unicorn, who am I then?

<p>
	Hunting is not about the joy of killing. Hunting is about the thrill of the hunt.
</p>

<p>
	Rogan hunts his own meat and says he doesn't buy meat from the store. In which case he's not killing any more than a non-hunter kills.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly Rogan exhibits stage Red and Orange to some degree. Mostly he's pretty healthy about it from what I can tell. He's not a toxic guy. He has a good heart. But I feel his audience can be easily mislead down an alt-right rabbit hole. It's easier to convince his audience that men and women are objective biological facts rather than that men and women are socially constructed and relative categories. A lot of his audience does not understand or appreciate stage Green, which is why bringing on people like JP, Sam Harris, the Weinsteins's, Dave Rubin, Tim Pool, Alex Jones, etc. is so problematic.

<p>
	A powerful technique they teach life coaches is called Validation. It works like this:
</p>

<p>
	Whenever a client introduces some new problem or challenge he's facing, you as the coach hear it out and say:
</p>

<p>
	Coach: "How does that make you feel?"
</p>

<p>
	Client: Explains feelings
</p>

<p>
	Coach: "How do you REALLY feel about?"
</p>

<p>
	Client: Explains even deeper feelings
</p>

<p>
	Coach: "I hear you say you really feel X because of Y. It's valid to feel that way because..."

	Rogan has many male followers from UFC & MMA, which are low on the Spiral and so they will skew a lot to the right, even though Rogan himself is Green.
</p>

<p>
	This is why Rogan's platforming of alt-righters is so problematic. It's the perfect bait for his vulnerable audience, but Rogan isn't aware of this because he's just flying by the seat of his pants.

<p>
	All identity is relative, subjective, and self-constructed.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you think you are, you're imagining that. Whether you think you're a human, a 30 year old male, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you feel some of these identities are more real and less constructed is because society happens to reinforce your imaginary identity.
</p>

<p>
	So, for example, if you were born into a society/culture which believed that all humans are aliens, you would identify as an alien and you would feel that this is your true biological identity.
</p>

<p>
	Your actual identity is Nothing. Which allows you to pretend to be whoever you want. But the added wrinkle is... since you are addicted to the approval and authority of your culture, you only tend to take seriously those identities which your culture says are valid and real. So when some college kid tells you that she's a unicorn, you think that's stupid. Because your culture tells you that people cannot be unicorns.
</p>

<p>
	Who is right? No one. It's all relative.
</p>

<title>Vaush on Fascism</title>

<p>
	Vaush is definitely over-blowing the whole Nazi/white supremacist/fascist angle.
</p>

<p>
	These people are right-wing. But right-wing has plenty of degrees and they should not all be equated with Nazis just because they have nationalist and ethnocentric predilections. Most people in the world are simply not evolved enough yet to be cosmopolitan. That doesn't make them Nazis. Calling such people Nazis makes the situation worse as they don't think of themselves as Nazis and they start to feel righteous in resisting progressives. "How can progressives be right when they keep calling me and my friends Nazis when we clearly aren't? Therefore progressives must be wrong."
</p>

<p>
	In his desire to be edgy Vaush is weakening his otherwise solid position.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarianism is good against a severe authoritarian state, perhaps like that in China.
</p>

<p>
	But libertarians always act as though the government is oppressing them -- no matter what size government is -- so they cry wolf even about sensible regulations which are not really oppressive.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like Medicare For All and Green New Deal and Civil Rights is not oppressive or authoritarian. It benefits the vast majority of people. Yet libertarians will oppose it. So they become useful idiots for corporations and plutocrats who want as little regulation and public services as possible.

<p>
	It seems that way to you because you watch too much right-wing media.
</p>

<p>
	The entire point of right-wing media is to make Green seem as toxic as possible -- because then we don't have to evolve.
</p>

<p>
	People are eager to have their existing worldview reinforced even if the existing worldview is what is toxic.

<p>
	To be fair, there is a progressive rabbit hole as well.
</p>

<p>
	The only difference is, the progressive one is much less toxic and actually helps advance society to the next stage.
</p>

<p>
	But progressive/Green ideology and group-think is still a thing. So be careful. If you watch too much progressive YT, you will develop blindspots.
</p>

<p>
	It's important diversity your sources and not just get all your info from YT.

<p>
	Paradox only arises when you try to grasp Oneness using a dualistic mind.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, you keep trying to put reality into relative boxes when it is absolutely unboxed.
</p>

<p>
	It is the same problem as when you try to map the Earth onto a flat square. The result is always distorted and full of seams which don't exist on the Earth itself.

And because you have such a competitive landscape you will get competing forces instead of unifying forces.

	In the end we all unified under Love. Love is not some fake story. Love is the bedrock of consciousness. So we don't need to bullshit ourselves with nationalist, racist, or fascist mythology. We can unify under a common consciousness of Love.

	These are the trade-offs between being more authoritarian vs democratic. But China pays a heavy cost for their rapid mobilization ability. It's dictatorial and tramples many civil rights.

	Yes, of course. And now we're talking about how to help the US reach the next level of evolution.

<p>
	What got us here will not be enough to get us to the next stage. We need a paradigm shift. Unfortunately conservatives see this paradigm shift as crazy, evil, and unAmerican. It's exactly the same thing as what happened with Galileo and the Catholic church. They were fearful of his new paradigm even though it was the obvious way forward.

<p>
	Here's an example of the common libertarian mistake of thinking that local government is better and less oppressive/corrupt than centralized government. The caller fundamentally misunderstands issues of scale and the fact that local gov is MORE corrupt due to its self-biased nature.

<p>
	Careful, technology will not save us or make us more conscious. Technology does not have consciousness of itself. Each stage will use new technology to advance its survival agenda, just as the internet is used by far right stage Blue nationalists or nuclear weapons could be used by stage Red terrorists. AI can be abused by lower stages. We're already starting to see it with deepfakes.

	More accurately he is a vain, incompetent, sociopath, narcissist, demagogue, opportunist with no principles or philosophy of any kind other than self-aggrandizement.
</p>

<p>
	To be a proper fascist he would have to care about some communal goal beyond his own personal aggrandizement. He's both too selfish and too lazy to care about such a goal. And even if he overcame that, he would be too ignorant and incompetent to execute it.

		<p>
			I'm amazed a systems thinker such as yourself is even interested in using such logic semantics as a defense.

		<p>
			Yes I appreciate they are in unique situations and their hands are tied, but you have to understand the reason people even use such language as "criminal" (even if it is recklessly applied sometimes) is to push back and challenge the systems that justify and rationalize those acts, and to expand our standards of what is acceptable behavior and what isn't.

<p>
	Presidents make all sorts of decisions that people will disagree with it. That does not a criminal make.
</p>

<p>
	My defense is not semantic. It's fundamental. Presidents are given serious life and death situations and decisions to deal with. If you start calling them criminals willy-nilly because they seem too harsh, that's your misunderstanding of the challenges and complexities of governing a nation of 330 million people.
</p>

<p>
	You can question and criticize their decisions without resorting to falsehoods and hyperbole.
</p>

<p>
	You can disagree with Obama without calling him a criminal. Calling him a criminal weakens your argument by making you look ignorant, reactionary, and sloppy.
</p>

<p>
	Making life and death decisions for a president is not a crime. It's the job!

<p>
	To call a president or politician a criminal is silly because the job itself just has serious consequences no matter who holds it.
</p>

<p>
	If you think Obama and Biden are criminals, you have no appreciation of what a truly corrupt person in such a position of power would be like.
</p>

<p>
	A few drone strikes is peanuts in the grand scheme of things and does not a criminal make. Obama is probably the least criminal a politician as has ever held serious office.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be careful with your liberal fantasies of how politicians and presidents should be angels. They can't be angels because they are in the business of fighting off monsters and devils. An angel would never get the job.
</p>

<p>
	When you are president, even a small decision could easily end up hurting or killing thousands of people. And often times your decisions are like this:
</p>

<p>
	Plan A: 1,000 people die
</p>

<p>
	Plan B: 100,000 people die
</p>

<p>
	There is no Plan C.

<p>
	It's similar to Silicon Valley. They are Green on social/culture issues, and Orange on economic and metaphysical issues.
</p>

<p>
	A capitalist is much more threatened by relinquishing Orange values on economics, metaphysics, and epistemology than they are in being pro-gay, pro-women, pro-minority. It doesn't cost Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Tesla, etc much to be Green on social/cultural issues. But it costs them tens of billions to give up Orange economics.
</p>

<p>
	The engine that runs most universities is still Orange capitalism/materialism. With a Green outer shell.

			Interesting idea. I don't know of many lower-ranked employees who would like to share the loss margins if the higher-ups mess up though. Would this require them to invest in the stocks of their company too?

		<p>
			It will take immense levels of trust between people. It could work. I'd say it's worth a shot.

<p>
	I think the most you'd stand to lose is your share of future profits and your job.
</p>

<p>
	The low level employees would not invest their own money. They would be given the share of ex-employees who left the company.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the company would constantly be reallocating shares based on who's working, how much work they do, and how valuable their work is. If you leave the company, you lose all your shares. If the company makes no profit, you gain no bonus, but you still get a base salary. If the company goes bankrupt you lose your job and your shares.
</p>

<p>
	Basically the point is to make sure that no one who isn't working in the company can buy shares. Only workers should be allowed to have a share of the profits, not outside speculators or Wall Street wolves.
</p>

<p>
	The billion dollar question I have is this: is it possible to entirely abolish Wall Street? Or does Wall Street actually serve a necessary role? Could we construct a society and economy in which Wall Street's role would be made completely obsolete? I'm not sure, but it's a question worth seriously exploring.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it should be obvious now why the people in power absolutely HATE this idea and will do everything in their power not to even consider it as a possibility. Those in power primarily thrive off the labor of others, yet they MUST deny this in their own minds.
</p>

	There are pros and cons to each location. And it depends a lot on where you live. Some cities are great for daygame while others are not. Some clubs and bars are shit, some are amazing. You can't beat a Vegas nightclub pool party for game. XS on Sunday nights in the spring and summer is just paradise. Los Angeles, Miami, NYC is great for daygame.
</p>

<p>
	Finding good locations is crucial to your success. Invest a lot of time finding the best locations.

<p>
	I think it could work the way pirate ships worked. The pirate ship was basically a co-op model. But it wasn't flat. It had hierarchy and strong leadership, but every pirate, even the greenhorn, would get a percentage share of all the loot.
</p>

<p>
	So, the captain might get 1/3 share.
</p>

<p>
	His lieutenants might get 1/15th share.
</p>

<p>
	And the lowest greenhorn sailor might get 1/100th share.
</p>

<p>
	As you rise up the ranks and gain more experience and responsibility, your share increases.
</p>

<p>
	This all basically boils down to how ownership and spoils get distributed.
</p>

<p>
	The federal gov could basically mandate that each corporation with over 10, 50, or 100 employees must adopt this share model or face heavy fines/taxes.
</p>

<p>
	1) Green must build on top of the accomplishments of Orange, not outright reject them. The difficulty is figuring out which aspects of Orange to ditch and which to keep. There is no simple answer to that question.
</p>

<p>
	2) Just cause it's Green doesn't make it more effective. Green's metrics for success are different than Orange. Green is more about relationship and community than raw productive output. Hippies aren't exactly well-known for their effectiveness. But, hey, maybe that's a better way to measure biz effectiveness.

<p>
	I honestly don't know if it would be a disaster or an triumph. It's hard to predict. It needs empirical testing.
</p>

<p>
	The whole trick with new social systems is that no one can really predict ahead of time whether they will work. It requires experimentation and fine-tuning in an evolutionary manner.

<p>
	That is the case with any chemical. Psychedelics affect people very differently.
</p>

<p>
	My experiences on DMT, for example, are highly unlike normal DMT trip reports. I get no visuals, I see no aliens.

<p>
	They are on this list. But good luck finding them.

			Do you consider the stacking of psychedelics to play a role in the experience? 
		</p>

		<p>
			For example, if someone has previously experienced MDMA, shrooms, LSD, DMT, and then takes 5-Meo, will they have the same experience as someone taking 5-Meo for the first time?

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's all one big arc. So yes.
</p>

<p>
	Even just with using one substance, your first 5-MeO trip will be very different from your 20th. The chemical is less of a factor than your mind's development is.
