</p>

<p>
	And people don't even confuse love with the Absolute. Just the opposite. People vehemently resist the notion that love could be an Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	People are just driven by emotions like robots because they never bother to contemplate or be mindful of their emotions.

	It's sort of like trying grab one part of a blanketing using another part of the same blanket because all you have to grasp with is blanket itself. The blanket is oneness. Oneness is trying to grasp itself but can't ever succeed in total. How can a blanket grasp itself totally? It can only grasp itself partially. To grasp itself totally is must simply be itself (without any grasping). And that is enlightenment.

Don't confuse it with other emotions. Love as an Absolute is not really an emotion.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to understand emotions, just observe them in your life as they arise. You don't need any awakening to do it.

<p>
	Actually, all symbols are just territory. There are maps proper. A map is what you get when you confuse part of the territory for another part of the territory.
</p>

<p>
	To make this real clear: if you draw a map of Florida in the sand on a beach in Florida, your map is literally Florida. There isn't a map + Florida. There is only Florida, which includes within it a smaller version of itself drawn in the sand. So what it means for Florida to be Florida is that is has drawings of itself within itself.
</p>

<p>
	Notice the fractal nature of how this works.
</p>

<p>
	Now expand this out to reality itself. A thought/image/symbol of reality is itself a part of reality. Such that all you have in the end is reality. All you have is the territory. So in fact: the map is the territory! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Strange loops are not a bug here, they are a feature. They arise due to the self-reference problem: when you have only one thing in existence, how can it point to itself? There cannot be a duality between map/territory. Symbols cannot stand outside reality because they are within reality and because there is nothing outside reality. Inside and outside are of course one.

			The question I raise as far as when the tables will really turn and the world really get's moving is when this stuff penetrates into mainstream culture. Stage Blue people in middle and southern end of the United States don't really seem to feel the magnitude of this technological revolutions because they're not really around it. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I think you underestimate its impact. Technology is always affecting culture, even in the rural South. Do they not have internet? Are they not affected by globalization? Are they not affected by Muslim migrants? Will they not be affected by driverless cars in 10 years? Are they not affected by closing factories and jobs moving to China? Are they not affected by Amazon 2-day shipping? Are they not affected by smart phones? Are they not affected by gay rights? Are they not affected by Youtube?
</p>

<p>
	You can't hide technology. Once it's mainstream it's everywhere around the world within a few years.
</p>

<p>
	To be clear, the effects of technology are not always positive. It's always a mixed bag. Stuff is changing very quickly now so there will be a lot of problems for people who are not quick adapters (which is most people). The faster one's environment changes the more mentally flexible and openminded one has to be to adapt to it. This is very big problem for stage Blue.
</p>

<p>
	All the political shifts we're seeing lately are directly connected to technological advancement.
</p>

<p>
	The 60's revolution itself was made possible by the technological developments of modern chemistry and psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Now try to imagine what might happen if 5-MeO-DMT went mainstream.

	I know that state well. There are no misgivings about being in it. It's is a state of total God-realization. You cannot want anything more.

<p>
	In the 60's the US was extremely Blue. Green was very radical in the 60's. There was a huge backlash to it. And it really only emerged in California and the most advanced cities. You have to understand that what shapes culture via the media is not representative of the average people. Many people in rural America are still very Blue. They are the Fox News audience.
</p>

<p>
	Probably 70%+ of the world is at stage Blue or below. Hollywood media is not representative of that, giving a skewed picture of progress. Most people in the world are still racist, homophobic, misogynistic, and nationalist. Basically 70% of the world population is at the level of development of Nazis. Think about that.

</p>

<p>
	If you care about survival there's no escaping that you will have to handle those survival issues. For example if you're starving and you have no money or food, no amount of meditation will fix that issue. But what meditation can do is allow you to die in peace. How? Well, you'd need to become very good at meditation or you'd need to awaken to realize that death is an illusion. The body will die from lack of food, but you as God will not.
</p>

<p>
	If you want the body to be alive there's no escaping finding food.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why spirituality is not an escape from everyday obligations. That's a bad way to look at it. You want to get masterful at handling survival issues. Which in your case means: design a way to make a decent living. Don't try to offload this issue on meditation or enlightenment. Learning how to earn a decent living is a whole skillset. It's tempting to think that you can avoid developing such skillets through "finding peace" via spirituality. That's a bad approach.
</p>

<p>
	As your practice spirituality though, even though you'll still have tricky survival issues to deal with, you will deal with them more calmly and effectively. They won't stress you out as much as they would otherwise because in the end you know that whatever happens will be okay. And you will have more emotional self-control.
</p>

<p>
	A simple way to calm yourself is to breath slowly and deeply for a few minutes or hours.
</p>

<p>
	Sedona Method is also really good for clearing out emotions.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot be emotional mastery without enlightenment. Emotional mastery is even harder than enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	But if you just want to do some basic self-help stuff and work on emotional issues, yes, you can do that. You ain't gonna be anywhere near understanding the true nature of emotions. But it can be helpful.

<p>
	You must understand that all such texts are highly context-sensitive. So you don't just robotically send such a text randomly to a girl.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I once sent that exact scorpion text to a girl because the day before at the bar she told me that she had scorpion pests in her neighborhood (she lived in Vegas). So it was a great text for her.
</p>

<p>
	If you think that text is sexual that's you reading that into it.

<p>
	Like I keep saying over and over again, enlightenment is not a binary thing, nor is it the only important factor. Spiral development stages are equally important and they are independent of enlightenment. You can have an enlightened Buddha who's also a racist and misogynist because he's at Spiral stage Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is not going to unwire all of your beliefs, habits, or worldviews. If you thought the Earth was flat before enlightenment, you will probably still think the Earth is flat after enlightenment.

<p>
	Yeah, I think that's possible to some extent.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is already that technology in powdered form.
</p>

<p>
	It still won't be that easy in practice because to deeply awaken your entire mind has restructure itself. It's not as simple as cutting a few wires. Your entire web of beliefs needs to be reconfigured too. Otherwise it will be a half-assed enlightenment leading to Zen devirly and pathology. And awakening alone is not enough, there is also the need for Spiral development which cannot happen simply through some surgery or even a chemical.
</p>

<p>
	There are all sorts of rare and interesting abnormal brain case studies. For example some people can hallucinate monkeys or see the world as a cell-shaded cartoon. Some people convinced that other people are robots. The brain/mind is a very tricky thing. Enlightenment is far from the only interesting mystical thing that the brain can do.

Sure, those monks are badasses, but I doubt how much of reality they really understand or how Spirally developed and well-rounded they are. I would bet most of them are underdeveloped on the Spiral, which would be a great shame.
</p>

<p>
	The thing is, running marathons has little to do with insight, development, or understanding. Don't automatically assume that doing brutal rigorous mechanical training methods will get you to the highest levels of understanding. I highly doubt it would. I am much more in favor of a thoughtful contemplative approach which incorporates study of psychology, sociology, semiotics, science, etc. I think some of the hardcore Eastern schools are not thoughtful and scientific enough. They can be too grounded in tradition for tradition's sake without evolving with technology and the times.

			Do you think that certain insights like Absolute Infinity (and potentially many more) are not possible to access with 40+ years mindfulness or self-enquiry? Do you think that maybe only through substances like 5 Meo Dmt can you truly go so deep that you become conscious of these things?

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, I think it's definitely possible, just very, very rare and difficult. Yogis and sages have definitely accessed the highest levels of awakening without any chemical assistance. I suspect though that they were exceptionally gifted, whether due to genetics, karma, past-lives, upbringing, the right brain chemistry, luck or a combination of all the above. I don't know exactly why some people are exceptionally spiritually gifted. That is still a deep mystery waiting for an answer.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO just makes it so much easier and more accessible to ordinary people.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend a hybrid approach.

	What I meant was, he's still missing a few deeper layers of awakening like Absolute Infinity and Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Last time I spoke with him I asked him why reality exists and he was not able to give me an answer. Nor was he aware of Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I still consider him enlightened. Just not at the highest level of understanding possible because I've clearly become conscious of why reality exists. So I know it can be done. Just probably not through mindfulness meditation and labeling.
</p>

<p>
	Being aware of God is one thing. Being aware of the mechanics of God is another yet deeper thing. There is a lot of important stuff to discover about the mechanics of God. How does God actually materialize reality? And why? This can all be understood and it is worthwhile to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take this to be anything negative against Shinzen. He's still great.

<p>
	Hehe, that's mostly what self-help as a field/industry is. That's okay. It's mostly geared towards stage Orange/Green folks. There are still very important lessons there, just don't expect it to come anywhere near the depth of the stuff I teach.
</p>

<p>
	Most self-help does not include a metaphysical, epistemological, or spiritual component. As a result, it cannot possibly be profound or an ultimate solution. But I'm still a big fan of even that type of basic stage Orange self-help. People really need it in our society. In fact, most people who follow me probably need it more than they need my metaphysical musings. Metaphysical stuff is quite advanced and assumes you've already handled other basic parts of life.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Reddit is not a high-quality source of life advice. You should expect a lot of keyboard-jockeys there. For the best advice, read quality books.

</p>

<p>
	Whatever thoughts arise in your human head/mind are of course God's doing. God does not think somewhere elsewhere from human minds. When God is thinking, it's using a human to do it because thinking requires form. So God as a formless entity technically cannot think unless it first materializes a human who then becomes a vehicle for thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	So you might say that God as formlessness cannot do anything at all, but at the same time it can materialize all of physical reality and then whatever physical reality does, is equivalent to God doing stuff.
</p>

	So formless God cannot eat a cheeseburger (because eating is form), but it can spawn a Big Bang, wait 14 billion years, spawn a cow, spawn a human, spawn a chef who cooks the cheeseburger, and then have the human eat the cheeseburger. That's how God eats cheeseburgers <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	God as formlessness lives vicariously through all form. Remember, form and formlessness are identical. So God literally is the taste of the cheeseburger. Ta-da! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Or think of it this way: when you're playing a video game you cannot directly enter the world of Mario as a human. But you can live through that world as the Mario character. To manipulate Mario's world requires that you use Mario as the interface. You become Mario while also being a human who's distinct from Mario. Mario can die but it does not harm you.

I don't think he is ultimately awakened, but he doesn't need to be in order to teach what he teaches, and he's more than enough awake for you. He's an excellent meditation teacher.

</p>

<p>
	Each trip will go deeper and deeper, and wider and wider. There will certainly be significant cumulative effects.
</p>

<p>
	With this method you're cramming years of spiritual growth into a single week. So be prepared for some ego-backlash and unexpected stuff. In a sense it must disrupt your old life. This can be both great and problematic when you return.
</p>

<p>
	I highly recommend it for very serious, seasoned spiritual aspirants with a very solid theoretical and practical foundation, and high emotional maturity. Not for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be too surprised if this kind of work makes your depressive or even suicidal for a while. You need to be stable enough to weather such storms. The payoffs though are HUGE.
</p>

<p>
	To handle a solid week of 5-MeO requires pushing yourself. The ego will want to stop somewhere half-way through as it gets overwhelmed with Truth.

<p>
	That's not good enough. It doesn't count unless it's direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you ARE the one moving the fingers. Who else is there but YOU? You are all there is! You are the entire universe moving those fingers. The only problem is that you've confused yourself with being limited to a human body/mind. Start thinking of yourself as the entire universe. That will help a bit to give you proper perspective. But merely thinking you are the universe is still not enough. You must directly experience that it is so. This requires awakening. The boundary between self and word must collapse.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to just believe me. Belief is the enemy here, even if it's positive belief or belief in nonduality. True nonduality is not a belief.

</p>

<p>
	You must break through the illusion of knowledge. No knowledge is actually possible.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot take science at face value in this work. You MUST contemplate for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Even more fundamentally, all human language is circular. And science is a human language. You cannot do science, math, or logic without language.
</p>

<p>
	So really what you should start contemplating is, What the fuck is language? How is language possible AT ALL?

<p>
	Actually no scientific variable is every clearly defined.
</p>

<p>
	Science has no definition for matter, gravity, energy, time, space, or any other fundamental property of nature. Because reality is groundless and nondual it is impossible to define. Any definition is partial, circular, and ultimately groundless.
</p>

<p>
	Check for yourself. What is energy exactly? What is matter? What is time? If you investigate this you'll discover that no scientist actually knows. You'll just be chasing your own tail. All scientific definitions must be circular. Energy is defined in terms of the unknowns of time, space, and matter. Matter is defined in terms of the unknowns of energy, time, and space. Time is defined in terms of the unknowns of matter, energy, and space. Space is defined in terms of the unknowns of time, energy, and matter. In this way, nothing is truly ever known but an illusion of knowing is created like a house of cards.

Contemplate your own examples.
</p>

<p>
	For example: Einstein's theory of General Relativity is only true at macro levels. It does not work at the micro levels of quantum mechanics. But even if it did, that still wouldn't make a difference because General Relativity is not true in your dreams or in a video game.
</p>

<p>
	And in the end, it's still only an approximation at best of only certain kinds of physical phenomena. There are a trillion things which General Relativity does not account for.
</p>

<p>
	Not to even mention that General Relativity is not possible at all outside the context of the human mind. General Relativity literally does not exist for a donkey. Because General Relativity is a symbolic human invention and projection onto reality. The remarkable thing is that it has any predictive power at all (but again, only relative to human life and human consciousness).

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, scientific models are NOT based on formal logic. Again, "formal logic" is a loaded word. There are an infinite number of different formal logics. So which one are you gonna base your scientific model on? They all contradict each other. You must do empirical research to determine whether your logic squares with reality. Often times it won't!
</p>

<p>
	In quantum mechanics particles do not follow Aristotelian binary logic. So physics has long ago debunked the naive notion that reality follows binary logic.
</p>

<p>
	The question of What is science? and How come science works? is a very tricky one. It takes decades of study and contemplation to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	In short, scientific models contain very partial and limited relative truths. They are true only under very very narrow circumstances and contexts. Just because some aspects of reality are predictable does not mean that reality is logical. In fact it tends to work the other way around: Whatever humans call "logical" is however reality happens to behave in contexts which are relevant to humans. For example, if chairs had a habit of turning spontaneously into cats whenever you sat on them, your mind would grow accustomed to that behavior and call it "logical".
</p>

<p>
	In practice, what you call "logical" is just whatever reality happens to do around you. If everyone you knew walked around naked on the street, you'd eventually start calling that logical. Because in fact it is impossible to distinguish between logical and illogical things. That is a matter of relative perspective. What's logical to me is not logical to you, and vice versa. Or to put it another way, YOU are the sole arbiter of what counts as logical. Whatever you insist is logical, becomes logical (for you). Whatever you insist is illogical becomes illogical (for you). Logic has no normative power. So if someone wants to be "illogical", they are free to do so and no amount of reasoning, argumentation, or evidence will convince them otherwise. Because they are only "illogical" relative to your judgment of them. They are not illogical in any absolute sense.
</p>

<p>
	There actually exists no standard to determine what counts as logical. It must be this way because reality is nondual and empty/groundless. Anyone who tries to ground reality in logic will fail. This was rigorously demonstrated back in the early 20th century. Logical positivism and the attempt to formalize reality with a finite system of symbols failed spectacularly. As it should have. Reality is not quantifiable or formalizable.

<br />


							
							
<p>
	You have to be very careful to distinguish formal logic from the word "logic" as it is commonly used in mainstream culture.
</p>

<p>
	Certainly formal logic is not what you use to run your life. Not anywhere close it.
</p>

<p>
	And even in the case of formal logic, did you know that there are an infinite number of different formal logical systems with varying truths? So which one are you gonna say is the truest one? How will you decide? By using some meta-logic? But then there are an infinite number of meta-logical systems with varying truths. So you'll need a meta-meta-logic, and so on to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	As Kurt Godel proved, no logical system which is complete is consistent. And no logical system which is consistent is complete. This is because Truth is infinite and cannot be captured in a finite set of symbols.
</p>

<p>
	Most people who tout themselves as being "logical" have no clue what logic really is and its limits. In everyday life the ego co-opts logic to commit devilry. Even the craziest and most deluded people think they are being "logical". So how can you trust logic then? You could think you are being perfectly logical whilst you are totally deluded. So logic is no guarantor of truth.
</p>

<title>Subscribing to no religion while parents want you to go to church</title>

<p>
	Classic conflict of stage Blue vs stage Orange
</p>

<p>
	That can be difficult if your parents are solid Blue. They will not be openminded enough to allow it. But you might be able to convince them.
</p>

<p>
	You could try to explain to them how meditation will lead you to God. And then when they go to church you stay home and do meditation. Emphasize the mystical aspects of their religion. Every serious religious practitioner does meditation/prayer/contemplation. Guide their religiosity to spirituality.

Sleep is unconsciousness, awakening is consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	After you awaken deeply you can be conscious even during deep sleep. It's sorta like existing in a pure void.
</p>

<p>
	Sleep is a tricky thing. The fact is you don't really know what sleep is. That requires contemplation.

<p>
	That is not what I am talking about.
</p>

<p>
	You are talking about an imagined unconscious state. I am talking about total consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot understand because you have not yet awoken. Once you awaken you will understand what was being pointed at.
</p>

<p>
	Your ideas of awakening are never going to match actual awakening. That's what makes this so challenging.

If it's dualistic it can still have some nuts of wisdom, but it will also contain a lot of misguided things.
</p>

<p>
	If you're using impure sources you will waste a lot of time sorting the the truth from the delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes I start reading a book, see too much dualistic delusion, and just stop reading. Such an impure source is not worth the effort to untangle when crystal clear sources exist.

<p>
	Be careful. Just because someone is a mystic or is enlightened does not automatically put them at Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of Spiral Dynamics is to differentiate between stages of development and awakening. They are not always correlated.
</p>

<p>
	Don't just assume that your favorite sage/mystic is Turquoise.

<p>
	The mind is a very powerful tool. Precisely because it is so powerful it is easy to get lost in the labyrinth of one's mind -- an endless labyrinth of symbols and ideas which tend to validate themselves no matter how misguided they are.
</p>

<p>
	Using the mind properly requires serious training, otherwise it falls into gross delusions.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately almost nobody teaches how to properly use the mind. People either teach how great the mind is, or how terrible the mind is, but not how to use the mind wisely.

<p>
	You are confused about who/what you are. This is how most normal people are. At the same time they identify with being the body, the mind, and also not that. They are unsure and confused. The mind plays these games where one minute it thinks its the body, another minute it thinks its a human, another minute it thinks its the voice heard in the head, another minute it thinks it was born, another minute it thinks its some kind of "soul", another minute it thinks its God, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	The purpose of self-inquiry is to become very strict with yourself and force yourself to confront this shell game that the mind plays. What are you REALLY? Not as a belief, but what the fuck are you? If you claim that you are real, then you must be able to clearly specify what is it that's real. The body? The voice? The memories of childhood? The feelings of pain? If we put a gun to your head right now, what is it that you fear will die? << That is the false self.
</p>

<p>
	Getting clear about the false self is just as important as discovering the True Self. You can't disidentify with something unless you first clearly realize that you're identified with it. You might be identified with your childhood memories and not even realize it. So you have to ask yourself very seriously, "Am I identified with my childhood memories? Is that what I actually am?" And so forth with any other possible identifications until you eliminate them all. What will remain is nothing, which is what you actually are.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	In the meantime you can study theory and maintain a mild daily practice of 30-60 minutes. You can also do a few yearly meditation retreats or psychedelic retreats.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes in this work you must inch your way up. Be creative. Find ways which fit your existing obligations.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't fool yourself into thinking that watching Borat is spiritual work. You must be brutally honest about whether the techniques you're using are actually raising your consciousness.

	The ego-mind will most-definitely misinterpret truth. Ignorance cannot help being ignorant. You can count on that.
</p>

<p>
	By understanding this you will be a little less likely to do it. But you will still not be immune.
</p>

<p>
	You must be careful and study many high-quality sources, and think for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Also understand that mistakes are part of the process. No one walks the spiritual path without making some mistakes. Trial and error is how we grow. The key is to stay vigilant enough to correct yourself. You need to have enough theory under your belt to know when you've veered off course.
</p>

<p>
	It's okay to be a bit deluded here or there so long as you know what the right course ultimately is.

	You can easily spend 20 years reading Western philosophy and still not get any closer to Truth. With that said, there is the occasional gem and I still encourage everyone to think through philosophical questions for themselves. Philosophy is not meant to be read or believed, it must be DONE! -- as in: contemplate everything for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The power of philosophy lies more in the questions than in the answers. If you are not contemplating for yourself, you are not actually doing any philosophy.

</p>

<p>
	You are framing what I said as "This is so inauthentic and artificial". But once you actually internalize the skill of proper texting, it will become authentic and natural.
</p>

<p>
	Every skill you learned was at one point inauthentic and artificial, from mathematics to reading to writing to typing on the computer.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying you need to keep a file of canned text messages. Once you understand the principles of texting with a girl, you can generate an infinite number of spontaneous texts. Without learning this skill, your text messages will suck and you will lose girls by committing stupid mistakes which only years later will you understand why.
</p>

<p>
	People expect to be good at sex and dating "naturally" without any deliberate practice. Because love is supposed to be "natural". This is a silly double-standard. Nowhere else in life do you adopt this attitude. If you want to be good at something you must train and recognize principles. Girls will appreciate it when you don't creep them out with your texts.
</p>

It's too radical and it requires serious focus.
</p>

<p>
	You will not wake up without scheduling some week-long retreats every year. Waking up requires intense and prolonged focus. 60 minutes of focus will not do it.
</p>

<p>
	Or try psychedelics. That's the most realistic way for ordinary people to get a taste of awakening. It's fast amd effective, unlike meditation.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, you can still maintain a daily meditation habit.

<p>
	It requires a change in state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The sense of I is more than just a feeling, thought, or belief. It's an entire state of being such that you know no other possibility.
</p>

<p>
	Changing that state requires a lot of concentration practice, or kriya yoga, or psychedelics.

			Then I see what other guys write to girls, like really "gay" stuff with heart smileys and shit. And girls seem to go crazy for it, these guys have a deeper connection with her than the guy who only writes her in a matter-of-fact style and then tries to get physical out of the blue.
		</p>

		<p>
			Havent you seen that when a girl fancies a guy they text each other all the time, shes constantly on her phone. A PUA would tell you to never do that and ignore her. I listened to this PUA stuff, set all these rules for myself what to do and what not to do and it backfired in my face every time. I'm still working on getting all these PUA concepts out of my head, its pure neurotic poison, thats just what it is.
		</p>

		<p>
			I think your advice on this topic is heavily biased by your PUA phase Leo. No offense at all but I think If dating happened naturally and not in a forced way as a PUA late in your 20s I think your advice on this would be A LOT different.

<p>
	I was only talking about pre-sex communications. Once you have sex with her, then you can text her more seriously.
</p>

<p>
	You must distinguish between pre-sex and post-sex behaviors. They are very different.
</p>

<p>
	Pre-sex, while you're dating, there must be some gaming going on. After she falls in love with you, you can cut the gaming.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to manipulate her too much via text. The key is not to display neediness and desperation. The biggest mistake made with pre-sex texting is that the guy fucks it up by trying to say too much, trying to be too edgy/cocky/funny. Trying to attract her via text doesn't work. So actually my advice is to not game girls via text. Use texting mostly to handle dating logistics laced with bits of humor.
</p>

<p>
	Make your texts totally non-needy and unimportant. Don't be sending her long letters via text. Never try to logically convince her of meeting you. All that crap will blow you out very fast.
</p>

<p>
	Here are good kinds of texts pre-sex:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Hey gurl, let's grab a coffee.
	</li>
	<li>
		Coffee! Lets go
	</li>
	<li>
		Saw this shirt at Walmart and thought it would be perfect for you [insert pic of ugly shirt]
	</li>
	<li>
		Meow...
	</li>
	<li>
		Moo
	</li>
	<li>
		Hey dork
	</li>
	<li>
		Let's hang out
	</li>
	<li>
		When you free this week?
	</li>
	<li>
		Let's do something this week
	</li>
	<li>
		How's the recovery going? (from last night's club/bar)
	</li>
	<li>
		You're the weirdest gurl I met last night.
	</li>
	<li>
		I want to build you a mansion out of Legos and stock it with exotic baby animals.
	</li>
	<li>
		Reading a book
	</li>
	<li>
		Chillin by the pool
	</li>
	<li>
		Making juice
	</li>
	<li>
		Clipping my toe nails, thought you should know
	</li>
	<li>
		Trimming my nose hair, thought you should know
	</li>
	<li>
		Going to club XXXXX tonight. You?
	</li>
	<li>
		You remind me of a dog I just saw
	</li>
	<li>
		You seem great and all but I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with you. I bet you snore like a pig.
	</li>
	<li>
		I want to stick a scorpion in your pants
	</li>
	<li>
		Hope this isn't too forward but I mailed you this basket of puppies [insert pic of basket of puppies]
		<ul>
			<li>
				A few of them might arrive dead, I was too cheap to swing for overnight shipping
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That kind of stuff. Keep it lite and chill. Zero investment is key.
</p>

<p>
	This is the extent of pre-sex texting.
</p>

<p>
	NEVER, EVER get sexual via text unless you've already had sex with her a few times. It comes off way too creepy and needy. Act like you don't care about sex.
</p>

A narrative.
</p>

<p>
	But there is a True You -- the True Self/No-Self/Nothingness/Void/God. Your true nature is not human but God. You are God thinking it is Paul. So when you realize that you are actually God, you will also realize that God has Will. God has infinite Will, in fact. Paul's will is a tiny splinter off God's infinite Will.
</p>

<p>
	So in a sense you will discover Paul was never really in control.
</p>

<p>
	But then you will also discover that since you are God, you control and create everything. As God, you have Will which you can use to create. So literally God allocates a tiny percentage of its infinite Will to this body of Paul's so that it could create a life. As a human your creative capacities are not infinite, they are limited so long as you are in a human form. If you exit the human form your creative power will be infinite, you can literally materialize physical objects out of thin air. But at this point you're not a human any more, you are the Godhead. You are that which you were before you were born.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, everything is God's choice. But the kicker is, you're God! But simultaneously you're human <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	None of this is to be believed. You must discover if it is true through consciousness practices.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become the more of God's Will will be at your disposal. Eventually you and God will merge into one such there will be zero distance between your lifting a finger and God willing it so.
</p>

<p>
	The definition of a devil is someone who thinks he is separate from God. The devil seeks to separate itself from God and rule using his own will. But the devil is always just a partition within God. So the devil is tricking itself into thinking that it is in control. Eventually the devil must surrender control and accept that it was God all along. This merges the devil back into God as if the separation never even happened. That's nonduality in a nutshell. Nonduality polarizes into duality and then depolarizes back into nonduality.
</p>

Police use overwhelming force in order to make sure people don't fuck with them. Which maintains the peace you enjoy.
</p>

<p>
	If you pull out a gun in a public area, you should expect to get shot by police. This is not inhumane. But obviously the police need to be well-trained not to use excessive force, especially against minorities. But if someone is waving a gun around in public, shooting him is not inhuman. If he has no gun, then he shouldn't be shot but tazered.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so complicated. It just requires good police training and accountability.

	Not sure why you needed to fly all the way to Mexico though. Bufo ceremonies are done in Europe all the time.

Most enlightened people just sit around and do nothing. You don't see enlightened people in the military or police force or 99% of other basic jobs.
</p>

<p>
	If everyone got enlightened tomorrow, society would completely collapse, worse than a nuclear war.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, enlightened people depend on the rest of society functioning unconsciously, in the same way that the police depend on criminals committing crimes.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment does have a certain elitism to it. It cannot really work unless society is advanced enough to support it. Or unless you are totally off on your own living in a cave. But even then you need someone to bring you food.
</p>

<p>
	In practice what happens is that an enlightened person is so rare the he can survive off his followers and fans.
</p>

<p>
	And also, in practice, if you are conscious enough to not suffer, you will be resourceful enough not to place yourself into a job where you have to shoot people.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, you can still probably be an enlightened police officer if you really wanted. I don't see why that necessarily requires suffering. There's no real contradiction shooting a bank robber. You shoot him because he's breaking an important law. Your job in this case is to defend society against devils, which ultimately helps society to awaken.
</p>

<title>How to survive whilst working towards life purpose?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/33841-how-to-survive-whilst-working-towards-life-purpose/?do=findComment&amp;comment=408962</link>

</p>

<p>
	There is no easy answer. Becoming financially comfortable whilst starting from scratch is very challenging, requiring creative thinking, strategy, focus, discipline, hard work, vision, and a bit of luck.
</p>

<p>
	In practice you will have to claw your way to the top using whatever means available.
</p>

<p>
	One very helpful piece of advice is to keep your living expenses as low as humanly possible. At least for the first 5 years of your LP, until you get established.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is to move to a very cheap part of the country, or even a 3rd world country as you develop your skills. Again, this is to keep your expenses as low as possible and buy yourself time to build skills.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is first build some more marketable skills which can help you pay the rent. For example it's possible to learn some programming skills, which tend to be well-paid.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is to work a relatively high-wage job for a year or two in order to save up a nest egg. There are some jobs which require zero experience and zero education but still pay well.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is to get a lower job but within your chosen field/industry. For example if you want to direct movies, rather than trying to get hired as a director (which is virtually impossible), try to get hired as an assistant to the director. Then you can prove yourself to the director and he might be willing to hire you in the future as a producer. Etc. Finally then you will become a director.
</p>

<p>
	Another possibility is to get a part-time job which allows you time to work on building your skills at home.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be very creative, opportunistic, and flexible when starting out.
</p>

<p>
	I spent 4 years building an entirely unrelated business to earn enough money to finally follow my LP. It was a huge detour and not at all easy or pleasant. But it was worth it.
</p>

			But how can you do all of that without suffering. Believing the thought ‘someone needs to be stopped’ by definition creates suffering. Fighting anything internally creates suffering. You can fight it externally, as long as you do not fight it internally. Are you saying we can’t survive without suffering?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Suffering IS a survival function. The only reason anything suffers is because it cares to survive.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering can be transcended through consciousness at the individual level, but at the collective level that's another story.
</p>

<p>
	Why are you framing it as "someone needs to be stopped"? You can act against devilry without being attached to it, and hence avoid suffering.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying you need to fight anything internally.
</p>

<p>
	I can vote against Trump without hating him. I can be conscious that he is me, but that he must still not be allowed to hold power. I can support the existence of a police department without suffering simply by understanding that police is needed for a decent society. This just requires some understanding of how government works.
</p>

<p>
	You can work to build a decent government without becoming an ideological partisan zealot about it.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, anything that can be done with suffering and attachment can also be done without suffering or attachment.
</p>

<p>
	You seem to be conflating action and education with suffering.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When the rubber hits the road, you will run crying to government to save your ass from the devils who want to rape you.
</p>

<p>
	The people who take government for granted are the ones who already feel totally safe because government has provided them with that safety without them even being aware of it.
</p>

<p>
	That's how good government is. It's amazing! Like magic!

</p>

<p>
	So you can act too cool for school, but that's only because someone else has worked their ass off to create a police force so that you can sit comfortably it your room without getting your throat slit.
</p>

<p>
	Survival demands action of you. If you are okay with dying, fine. Then you will die. See ya in the next life.
</p>

<p>
	Do not take government for granted. Without a good government you would be a slave. And good government does not happen by accident. It requires intense battle and effort against devils who would wish to enslave you.

</p>

<p>
	Start with a small dose and slowly work your way up.
</p>

<p>
	Any psychedelic can produce ego-death.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really prepare for it. It will just blindside you, you'll be dead before you realize what just happened. And then you will laugh as you realize death is a joke.

This is pathological Zen devilry.
</p>

<p>
	You are shirking your responsibilty as a creator. Nothing needs to happen, but that doesn't mean we cannot decide to execute Hitler for being a vicious devil.
</p>

<p>
	We get to decide how we want life and society to unfold. If you want to sit back and do nothing, that's fine, but that is your choice. Do not act like you are not making a choice. By not making a choice you've made your choice.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever choice we make becomes God's will.
</p>

<p>
	Reality makes things happen through YOU! Not for you. If you choose to not prepare for winter, winter will come and you will starve to death. Reality will not magically feed you. Reality gave you enough smarts to not be so stupid as to ignore winter.
</p>

<p>
	You are exhibiting a dangerous level of naivete.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality does NOT mean inaction or indifference.
</p>

<p>
	To escape personal suffering into some Nirvanic formless state and then to act like nothing else matters because you are free of suffering is perhaps the highest form of Zen devilry I have seen.

</p>

<p>
	If something is true, it is happening in your experience and you can observe it happening.
</p>

<p>
	So all you really have to do is look at what is actually happening without adding your own stuff to it.
</p>

<p>
	The tricky part is that you add A LOT of your own stuff to it.

<p>
	There is no formulaic answer.
</p>

<p>
	It's a delicate tight rope act. Following one's heart and intuition is a good rule of thumb. But that already assumes you've got a pure heart and good intuition, which not all people have.
</p>

<p>
	Mostly I keep myself safe by cross-referencing 100s of diverse sources and by understanding that my mind is self-deceptive.

			Is flow state a quasi 'mystical experience'?

			Whenever I get into flow (usually in high stake situations in sports, adventure sports etc) I will think right after the experience 'holy shit how did I manage to do that?' 
		</p>

		<p>
			Then I wonder-where did the 'I' go during that moment? My sense of self dissapeared for the duration and it it felt like time stopped...its quite difficult to subjectively explain the feeling because its so foreign.

		<p>
			Hence, I was wondering if this is a glimpse into no-mind. How does flow state relate to nonduality?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is some similarity but it is also not really a mystical or nondual experience at all. You are still deeply unconscious in a flow state.
</p>

<p>
	It is similar in the sense that the sense of I is gone and thoughts are gone. But awakening is much more radical.
</p>

<p>
	Flow state shows you how nice it feels to not have ego controlling your life. But it gives you no understanding of what reality, Self, or God is.

<p>
	No, almost the opposite. 
</p>

<p>
	All that nonduality requires is to shut off the mind and sit in silence and concentrate for long periods of time.

<p>
	Concepts and thinking are the #1 obstacle.
</p>

<p>
	Sitting in silence and not thinking is not so easy if you are addicted to thinking (which everyone is).

	Not just I understand it. Thousands of people do. But most mathematicians don't because they don't question metaphysics. Their entire pursuit is conceptual.

</p>

<p>
	These things cannot be argued at you. You must take responsibility to contemplate them on your own.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to understand what 2+2=4 means, start by contemplating: What is a number? What is equality? What is truth?
</p>

<p>
	These are questions which takes years to contemplate.
</p>

<p>
	The greatest mathematicians on the planet do not understand such things. It cannot be explained to you in a forum post. This is very serious stuff. Argument, proof, and reason count for virtually nothing here because all of those have been co-opted by ego.
</p>

<p>
	If you truly understood what a number is, or what truth is, it would collapse your entire reality.

<p>
	I did answer your questions but you are incapable of understanding what I am saying because you insist on maintaining your paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	What I am telling you is outside that paradigm. So this conversation cannot go any further.
</p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating how tricky the mind is. You cannot trust anything your mind says. It's all games and lies.

<p>
	You can't understand that at your current stage of development and consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	At your stage of cognitive development you simply take objective reality for granted, as a given. But there actually isn't such a thing.
</p>

<p>
	Your MIND is constructing "physical" "reality". The reality you construct is precisely of the sort which allows you to survive as yourself. Everything you consider "real" is filtered through your ego to make sure it allows the illusion of a self to survive as the illusion that it is, without you realizing that it is an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	If you weren't doing this, you'd be dead and a physical world would not exist.
</p>

<p>
	2+2=4 is a relative truth. It is true because you say it is and by how you situate it within your entire scheme of conceptual understanding. It is not an Absolute Truth.
</p>
