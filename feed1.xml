<title>Can psychedelics get you to Rainbow body?</title>

<p>
	No, psychedelics can give you some amazing glimpses, but they will not do this kind of bodily transformation which takes decades of daily training.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, ordinary meditation and even awakening experiences themselves will also not give you this kind of super-natural degree of bodily transformation.
</p>

<p>
	You're asking for something which extremely few people have ever achieved via whatever methods. The only person who has a chance of achieving this is a full-time monk who has no life other than meditation/yoga. So even talking about such things is almost pointless because no one who is connected to the internet will ever achieve it. If you need guidance on how to achieve it, you will never achieve it.
</p>

<title>Why does enlightenment have to be so hard to achieve?</title>

And those who do are almost always talented or predisposed to it.
</p>

<p>
	This is one of those truths which nobody in the spiritual community wants to admit.

<p>
	This is the key problem right here.
</p>

<p>
	To have a realistic chance at awakening your technique needs to be rigorous and you must do it hardcore, at industrial grade levels.
</p>

<p>
	On and off again meditation, even if done for 40 years, will not be enough in most cases. It's very important to do long mediation retreats where you can focus for days at a time without interruption. If this wasn't the case monks and yogis wouldn't be a thing.
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha is a good example of what it takes to seriously awaken. He wasn't dicking around. He renounced his whole life. And that's basically what it takes.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a glimpse of what the Buddha accomplished without renouncing your whole life, psychedelics offer that, just ween off anti-depressants.
</p>

<p>
	I suggest you focus less on awakening right now and more on basic personal development and mental health, so you can be free of anti-depressants. Don't get too ahead of your skiis. There's much value to basic personal development work. That's what most ordinary people need who are not ready to renounce their whole life.
</p>

<p>
	Many books have been written about how to overcome depression. Do your research and get to work.
</p>

<p>
	What people often overlook is that corruption is a relative and system thing. In a systemically under-developed country like Bolivia there's no hope of electing a perfectly uncorrupt leader. It's a matter of gradual improvement.
</p>

<p>
	That's a deeply stage Blue country which has a lot of growing pains ahead.

<p>
	Any sufficiently complex thing should in theory be capable of awakening, assuming its got an ego to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	That's my best guess so far. It's still an iffy area for me.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see why compters cannot one day develop egos. But we are very far from that. Current AI is not even in the right ballpark.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is made of consciousness. Just different configurations of it.

<title>schizophrenic taking ayahuasca?</title>

<p>
	You are better off starting on a different psychedelic like LSD or mushrooms which can be dosed much more accurately.
</p>

<p>
	The key for you is to start with a very low doses and gradually ramp up. You will not be able to do that with Aya because it's never accurately dosed by shamans.
</p>

<p>
	Taking a random dose can certainly cause a freakout. I would consider that¬†reckless in your case.
</p>

<p>
	Accurate dosing of psychedelics is crucial in this work.
</p>

<p>
	1g of mushrooms or 60ug of LSD is a good starting point. Most people should easily handle such a dose.
</p>

<p>
	It's nothing personal. It's not like I hate WinterKnight. It's just that I won't allow a teacher to use my platform to teach things I clearly know are mistaken.
</p>

<p>
	It would be like allowing someone to enter a Zen temple and set up shop in the corner, teaching the opposite of Zen. Obviously that would not be tolerated. In such a case, go set up your own school. Then you can teach whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	No school tolerates all perspectives equally. The whole point is to exclude false teachings. Who gets to decide what is a false teaching? The one who runs the school. How else could it be?

<p>
	Femininity is attracted to masculinity.
</p>

<p>
	Being nice does not exude masculine essence.
</p>

<p>
	Which is not to say there's anything wrong with being nice. Just don't expect it to make a girl wet.
</p>

<p>
	Women get attracted by boldness, confidence, and assertiveness. And other things, like wit and humor.

<p>
	Kriya yoga might be a good option.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, if you have serious mental health issues you'd probably want to sort that out before pursuing enlightenment. Enlightenment is very advanced stuff. Handle the basics first. Usually a guru will not teach you yogic techniques until you are mentally stable and have your life handled.

	But also keep in mind that 2 days after a trip is still the honeymoon phase. So don't be surprised if you fall back into duality and ego.

<p>
	And your work is still not complete. There is much more to become conscious of. This is only the beginning of your development, not the end.

The only way God can react to itself is through a finite form. These reactions will vary as much as the forms vary.
</p>

<p>
	If you as a human are amazed, that is how God reacts to itself.
</p>

<p>
	If some other human is horrified, that is how God reacts to itself.
</p>

<p>
	If some other human shits his pants, that is how God reacts to itself.
</p>

<p>
	Neither reaction is better or truer than any other. All reactions are relative and partial. Reaction is only possible in the domain of form and duality.
</p>

<p>
	A combination of awe, terror, joy, and confusion is a common human reaction. How a human reacts depends a lot on how pure the human's mind and body are. The bigger one's shadow the more contracted and fearful one's reaction will tend to be.

You are describing unhealthy Green, not Green proper. And Yellow must build on a foundation of Green. Each stage builds on the previous ones.

<p>
	Sounds like you were doing it in a creepy way.
</p>

<p>
	This almost never happens.
</p>

<p>
	If you are camping a small supermarket every day, yeah, you will probably arouse suspicions.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do lots of approaches you need a large¬†high volume area like a mall or nightclub or sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
	Places like supermarkets require being highly selective. You can't be an approach machine there.
</p>

<p>
	Flirting with a stranger is not sexual harassment. Girls are used to being chatted up. If you do it right, the girl should feel flattered and pleased about herself. It's a huge ego boost for her to be desired. Just don't be creepy. Dress nice, smell nice, groom nice, and SMILE for fuck's sake. Do not approach girls without a big cheeky smile.

And so culture will evolve.
</p>

<p>
	Rape and pilage is self-defeating because karma is a bitch. You rape long enough, someone you love will get raped. And that will make you rethink rape.

<p>
	They could, if they seek publicity.
</p>

<p>
	Osho was great at it.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru got nothing better to do than fly around and charm people. He already finished his spiritual awakening process.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru is just executing his life purpose of awakening the ignorant masses. Publicity can be useful for this. Ignorant masses love¬†stunts. If Sahguru shot a fireball out of his ass, they'd all be impressed and start doing his yoga.

<p>
	Don't limit karma to something that happened in the past. Karma is all your current habits.
</p>

<p>
	Your time is better spent becoming more conscious of all your present habits, emotional reactions, beliefs, attachments, fears, desires, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can't change the past. Work on the present.

<p>
	That is how all dualities work. You cannot have an up without its opposite, you cannot have a beginning without its opposite.

	I would recommend that you have a psychedelic breakthrough by whatever means possible as soon as possible. Otherwise you just can't understand what you are missing. But of course responsibility for that is all on you. I cannot tell you want to do.

	You're basically not going to even understand those levels without becoming a full-time mystic/yogi/monk with decades of hardcore practice achieving crazy high mystical states.
</p>

<p>
	Those are the kind of things which cannot be written or talked about. You're gonna be all on your own. Don't expect any support, validation, or anyone to understand you.

	Sorry, cannot allow a teacher on here who denies the truth of Love and God. That kind of corruption is unacceptable no matter how helpful the person might otherwise be. His formulation of nonduality is simply incomplete.

<p>
	I don't know what your deal is, but Yellow is close to Turquoise, so you don't need to actively avoid Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	All it should take to get you interested in Turquoise is a few solid mystical experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Turquoise is basically inaccessible without mystical experiences. Seems like you're lacking those.

</p>

<p>
	In your self-centeredness you interpret the message of "stop violence against women" as somehow taking resources away from men. Yet this message doesn't mean to ignore men's issues.
</p>

<p>
	You lack basic empathy for those who are not you.
</p>

<p>
	You are like a white guy in the colonial South who walks by a poster that says, "Stop slavery now!" and you say to yourself, "But why should I care about the slaves when white poor folk are hungry on the streets? How is helping slaves fair?"
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking that helping to elevate others somehow takes away from you. This is a scarcity mindset.
</p>

<p>
	By caring about women, you will increase your care for men. By helping animals you will also help the whole universe. << this is the proper attitude. Love is an unlimited resource, so you don't have to worry about holding it back.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	A good way to test for flakes on the day of the date is to text her 1hr before you get in your car: "Doing some chores and then will head out." If she doesn't respond, you know she's gonna flake.
</p>

<p>
	If she's gonna go on a date with you, she needs to be responsive to texts.

<p>
	That's due to class similarities.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to use cultural disagreements to distract from class differences. So lots of simple-minded people end up supporting Trump for cultural reasons against their own class interests.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is clearly not going to help low income people because he's thinks they are scum.

	That's how it is. Takes a lot of practice to overcome that. Usually years of rigorous practice are required.

<p>
	This problem of boredom is existential. It goes very deep. It can't be avoided. The point of meditation is to face it directly, which creates suffering -- which is why hardly anyone meditates.

<p>
	That's a classic example from philosophy of mind / phenomenology. Unfortunately even when you give that example, people still ignore it. Materialism simply discounts all phenomena as "subjective" and therefore insignificant.

<p>
	A materialist scientist will simply not understand how seeing the color red has any importance to science. "Okay, so even if I miss the color red, so what? Doesn't change a thing."

It's more important to mobilize the progressive base.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Bernie and Yang have some cross-over, which is nice.
</p>

<p>
	But Biden does well against Trump in polls.
</p>

<p>
	Warren would probably have the hardest time. But then again, caring about what Trump voters think/want is not a top priority. They had their chance, they fucked it up, and they show little remorse.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump voters admitted their error, then maybe we could have more sympathy for them. But as long as they act like assholes and keep denying any wrongdoing, no deal. There need to be consequences for electing terrible leaders. You don't get to elect a terrible leader and then come back the next time and make demands about how you're not getting enough of what you want, expecting everyone cater to your priorities.
</p>

<p>
	Catering to Trump voters is not necessary to defeat Trump.

<p>
	I simply consider that healthy Green.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful holding demonization as a defining feature of Green. That's pathological Green.

<p>
	Of course Bernie has some elements of Yellow in him. It's hard to tell what the exact percentages are without knowing him more personally.

<p>
	Love and forgiveness is the solution in such a case.
</p>

<p>
	What such a "test" is testing you for, is the breadth and depth of your love.
</p>

<p>
	If you fail the "test", that's okay too. You'll just suffer more.
</p>

<p>
	The cure to all forms of abuse is deeper self-love, both for the parent, the child, and the abuser.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive because when your survival is deeply threatened the last thing you want to do is love. It takes great wisdom, bravery, heart, and consciousness to be able to love in such situations. And therein lies the "test". Such situations reveal your true level of development. Highly developed beings are capable of embracing it with love. But of course this is rare among humans. We are a crude species.
</p>

<p>
	Deeper self-love is the cure to all trauma and injustice.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, I don't make a big deal about it. I'm just pointing out hidden consequences which you may not have considered to this action.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is more complex than just mind/body. There seem to be structures which persist between lifetimes. Suicide could affect those structures.

			It's not like the only way to exist is by being attached to an animal host, in our case it is being the homo-sapien bodies. It is like people have no confidence in their being and they rely upon an animal-host¬†to exist, no matter how much pain/suffering this animal host gives to the Mind. Especially when your Mind advanced enough to not be "content" with whatever pleasures the animal host can provide, be it sexual, food, any other forms of carnal entertainment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In the ultimate sense, everything leads back to total oneness, so there is no problem. But it seems to take consciousness many incarnations to get there. I'm not saying suicide will damn you forever to hell. I'm saying it could be temporary set-back, slowing the overall process. There is nothing wrong with slowing the process, per se. It's all relative.

<p>
	By definition everything that happens is "God's plan". But not in the simplistic sense of everything being predetermined. God's plan is a meta plan which includes your human plans. You have the freedom to make your human plans.
</p>

<p>
	No choice is right or wrong. Any choice you make is fine from God's POV. God has no desire to manipulate you and no particular desired outcome.

<p>
	It's imaginary in the same way a brick wall is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	The notion of "imaginary" is much more robust than most people think. It encompasses all of "physical reality". So just saying that something is imaginary doesn't automatically set you free of it.

<p>
	Nope. Humans clearly affect nature with our actions. Even if you decide to take no action, that will have an affect on nature. It is impossible to not take action. Even inaction is a kind of action.

<p>
	That's warm but doesn't hit the nail on the head.
</p>

<p>
	Your definition is not fundamental enough. It still requires activity like "recognizing" and "communicating", which is 2nd order stuff.
</p>

<p>
	1st order Love requires no action. 1st order Love is simply Being itself.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to think of it is like this: replace your notion that everything is made out of atoms to "everything is made out of love". Love is the very substance of physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	An exercise I like to do is to look at my hand and just remind myself that it's made out of Love. This reconnects me with Love, reminding me that it's more fundamental than an activity.

<p>
	As soon as you start rating happiness, you'll lose it.
</p>

<p>
	The proper answer is: who gives a fuck? Reality is whatever it is and you feel however you feel at any given moment. Don't confuse true happiness with mood. That can be a serious error.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to "lock in" a happy mood is very counter-productive. You are guaranteed to fail at that.
</p>

<p>
	If you want real happiness, stop caring whether you're dying or being tortured. Then you'll be happy. And nothing less than that will hold up.
</p>

<p>
	Karma is much more than fear mongering.
</p>

<p>
	This topic is too complex and advanced to discuss on a forum. You'd need decades of advanced spiritual practice to begin to understand such things and I'm nowhere near understanding all that.
</p>

<p>
	If you violently disrupt consciousness (via suicide), it's not unreasonable to expect a ripple effect which cascades from such an event, disrupting the evolution of consciousness. Don't think of it as a punishment, think of it as a natural consequence of self-rejection and self-hatred. How can consciousness continue its evolution if it hates itself so much it cannot even finish out one human life?

<p>
	That's a bit questionable. I'm not certain how much of Obama was Yellow or Orange/Green. It's hard to tell without knowing him more deeply.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, the higher a person is up the Spiral the harder he is to assess accurately because there is more uniqueness of expression at Tier 2.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie is definitely more progressive than Obama, so I see Bernie as a step up for American politics. He is certainly less acceptable to the mainstream than Obama. America has yet to elect a solid, powerful Green leader. Few people embody solid Green. It's one thing to dabble in Green, it's another thing to really master it as Bernie has.
</p>

<p>
	For America to elect a solid Green leader would be a massive step forward. And it would cause a serious backlash as well. Bernie will not be well tolerated by many people even if he is elected. Turbulent times are ahead as America is forced to go Green kicking and screaming. We need to solidify in Green before we start worrying too much about Yellow. Green is good enough for now.

</p>

<p>
	I don't rank consciousness on any linear scale because I feel that would be misleading.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that just because a book is on my book list doesn't mean I agree with it 100%. If that was my standard the book list would be empty. I expect you to read books and evaluate them using careful and nuanced discernment. No book can be trusted or followed blindly.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that spiritual paths can be very unique. Don't try to follow anyone else's way. Make your own way -- whatever that entails. My way entailed psychedelics and I don't regret it.

<p>
	It happens all the time. Tens of thousands of times per year.
</p>

<p>
	But don't assume the "respawn" is free and clear. There is very likely an enormous karmic debt that comes with suicide. So avoid it if you can.

<p>
	No, it has it's value. We just need to be conscious of its limits.
</p>

<p>
	If it had no value I wouldn't have it on my book list.
</p>

<p>
	Try to be more nuanced in your thinking. Things aren't good or bad, valuable or valueless. It's all in the details.
</p>

<p>
	Tools of the mind need to be used properly to avoid traps and errors.

<p>
	A human being grasps and understands and deals with tiny portions of God. A human is like 0.0000000000001% of God and has that amount of power allocated to him/her. Humans thoughts affect reality, but in a very weak way.
</p>

	A human is like an App in an OS which has only been given access to a tiny percentage of the total system resources. It is not proper for a single App to have access to total system resources and root access. These limitations are there for your safety so you don't accidentally kill yourself and the entire Earth.

<p>
	These days YT is very over-saturated. You have no idea how competitive and manipulative marketing is. It's a blood sport. This is not a game. You are talking about money here. Tens of millions of dollars. People are ready to kill you for money. Never forget that.
</p>

<p>
	Internet success is highly manipulated behind the scenes in ways which most of you cannot imagine. It is a Wild West for hacking, spaming, bots, money exchanges, politics, deal-making, backstabbing, lying, manipulating, stealing, bribery, exploitation, etc. This is how business works. It's ugly behind the scenes. Do not assume that internet success is "natural". There's nothing natural about most of it.
</p>

<p>
	Many giant internet companies defrauded their way to success and all of it is kept secret, creating the illusion of "natural" growth.

This is not a flex. This is really advanced stuff that most humans cannot fathom or handle. You've sorta got yourself in the deep end here.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to keep in mind that most humans beings have the consciousness level not much higher than animals. So this stuff is not suitable for most people.

<p>
	You feel that way because you are so needy.
</p>

<p>
	When you get a really clingy girlfriend you will see that it repulses you. You will start to¬†feel disgusted by her and even have desire to abuse and exploit her. She will start to feel almost sub-human to you.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously this can get very toxic and dangerous.

	Good, this is called Wu Wei, or effortless action.

	Your spirituality is skin deep if it is forced, premeditated,¬†or mechanical. The¬†key is to make it a seamless activity of your whole life, your natural way of being.

<p>
	Of course awakening helps with detachment in¬†profound ways.
</p>

<p>
	But if you can't teach yourself to attract girls I would not trust you to be able to awaken yourself. That's much harder.
</p>

<p>
	Start with managing the easier stuff.

<p>
	Before you go spending a lot of money on that, I would doing a comprehensive blood work, check your hormone levels, and get a heavy metal provoked urine test using DMSA and ALA.
</p>

<p>
	Heavy metal toxicity is one of the leading causes of ADHD and other issues like that. You need to test for mercury, lead, arsenic, etc. If these chemicals are in your organs/brain they can serious decrease cognitive performance and cause all sorts of other problems.
</p>

<p>
	Blood testing for heavy metals is not good enough. A provoked urine test is necessary using DMSA and ALA.

<p>
	Because suffering is false,¬†same as fear.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason you don't like suffering is out of selfishness. So by trying to end suffering you are doubling down on selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to suffering is to stop caring about it. Stop trying to escape it.

<p>
	Actually I never said that.
</p>

<p>
	You certainly can become enlightened that way. I just consider it an inferior motivation.
</p>

<p>
	The soul's desire for Truth/Love/Union is a higher drive than the escape of personal suffering. The soul actually doesn't care about suffering. Suffering is irrelevant in the end since it is a finite and relative illusion.

<p>
	They are not the same spectrum at all.
</p>

<p>
	SD is a lot more modest and successful as a model. SD does not rank people in a simplistic fashion. It acknowledges that people are complex and occupy multiple colors across multiple lines.
</p>

<p>
	I notice that many of you here have not studied SD deeply. You have a very surface level understanding of it based purely on watching my videos, which is a problem.

<p>
	Ego, ego, ego. Survival, survival, survival. Duality, duality, duality.
</p>

<p>
	Being outraged by and righteous about a thing is survival and delusion.
</p>

<p>
	This work is about truth, not justifying attacks on¬†parts of reality which threaten your survival.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you attack is none other than your self. Just because you hate something a lot doesn't change this fundamental fact.
</p>

<p>
	If you have been hurt in the past, that is understandable, but adding ego on top of the hurt creates a spiritual trap.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot overcome evil through hatred or judgment. Never, never, ever. Until you realize this, you will be stuck.
</p>

<p>
	The only solution to evil is Truth. And what you wrote above is not Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not just based on one man's reaearch, and¬†it's a complex model that doesn't assign people numerical values for awakening, and like I always say, you need to understand that it's relative and has its limits.
</p>

<p>
	SD is much more robust than a linear numerical scale for nonduality.

<p>
	You do not know the degree of awakening of any human beings. Just keep that in mind. That is what is true for you. Anything else are beliefs you have picked up from hearsay or your own speculations.
</p>

<p>
	You have no idea how awakened Ekhart Tolle is, or Ramaji is, or anyone. And even the notion that you could know is highly suspect.
</p>

<p>
	Assigning numbers to teachers is a dangerous game.
</p>

<p>
	It's extremely important that you admit to yourself that you don't really know these things. Otherwise you fall into a delusion of thinking you know something which you actually do not know.
</p>

<p>
	If Ramaji's mind is corrupt, then his scale could be corrupt and you have no way of knowing that. You cannot just assume that his scale is accurate. To assume such a thing would violate the whole thrust of our work here.
</p>

<p>
	FYI, Ramaji's numerical rating of me was immediately incorrect. He rated me too highly and wasn't aware he did so.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot trust anyone in this work. No one! Not Ramaji, not Buddha, not Christ, not me.
</p>

	No, it is based on Ramaji's experience, which is hearsay/belief to you.

<p>
	You guys need to be a lot more accurate about identifying when a thing is belief/hearsay vs direct experience.

<p>
	Awakenings do not come with numerical values attached. Lol. This is not even Ramaji's direct experience, it is something his mind is constructing.

			The main doubt/excuse¬† is this: I¬†have a fear that if I'm going to approach a girl on the bus, on the way to school or even in school or in my town,¬†people will start say that I'm a weirdo that talks to strangers and the consequenses that this might have scares me.¬†
		</p>

		<p>
			So, are there other places where I can go to meet new people or I should brake through my fears?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	You will ALWAYS have that fear. That fear is not going to go away no matter which location you go to.
</p>

<p>
	It takes 1000s of approaches to start to get fearless. Until then, expects lots of fear. Approach despite the fear.
</p>

<p>
	Bus, sidewalk, cafe, mall, store, school... it's all the same.
</p>

<p>
	If it looks wierd it's because your mind imagines it so, and also because you are doing it in an uncool/creepy¬†way. When done well an approach is never creepy or weird, regardless of location.
</p>

<p>
	You can even aproach a kissing couple on a park bench and have fun flirting with his girl. It's all in how you do it.
</p>

<p>
	You can even approach while she is with her mother and father and flirt with the whole family! Again, this requires some serious skill, so don't start here.
</p>

<p>
	The best location to start is bars and clubs because you can get away with a lot less skill and there are 10x more opportunities so you can blow up interactions without worry. During the day time you need to be much more precise than at night. Day time presents much less opportunities so you gotta strike with precision and skill.
