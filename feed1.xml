<title>Response to Leo's Blogpost Regarding LSD Brainscans</title>

<p>
	That is correct. Ego requires an activated default mode network which is deactivated by psychedelics. Ego is an active construction. The default state is Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics deactivate certain portions of the brain and interconnect others. This is sort of like unseating a tyrant and installing a widely distributed democracy.

<p>
	Well, they obvious had some kind of financial backing, from parents or whatever. Tickets to India don't pay for themselves.
</p>

<p>
	There do exist ashrams/monasteries around the world which are free. Which basically means you live there and work for them.
</p>

<p>
	Osho's commune had people paying him tons of money to be there. Sometimes giving up their entire life savings.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta be careful. Sometimes these ashrams/communes will leech your money or can even be actual cults.
</p>

<p>
	When cash is low, you can get creative. For example, your cash will go much further in India or South East Asia than in Costa Rica. Then again, you tend to get what you pay for. There are lots of shitty places in India.

Robert Monroe's books are good. Thomas Campbell talks a lot about astral projection too.
</p>

<p>
	I have never had a proper OBE. I've had sleep paralysis a couple of times, but it was very short and I never made much sense out of it. For me they are extremely rare. My guess is, I don't have the right type of brain/pysche for it.

</p>

<p>
	In the end, you cannot run away from solving the career/job problem. This is the entire problem of survival. You can't just expect someone else to solve this problem for you. This is a huge thing. This is what my LP Course is for. There is no quick fix solution to survival.
</p>

<p>
	If you had a decent job you could save up money.
</p>

<p>
	If you had a decent business you could live off passive income.
</p>

<p>
	If you had highly valuable skills you could offer those for trade.
</p>

<p>
	But all of that takes years to establish.
</p>

<p>
	Ashrams are not a cure-all for life and in some ways they can be a trap. Once you're there with no money and no exit strategy, you're stuck.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot expect to just live your whole life mooching off of others. What value are you going to offer the world? Answering this question is not really optional. By not answering the question your answer is the default: nothing. Which means, don't expect much in return from the world.
</p>

<p>
	You only get what you give.
</p>

<p>
	To escape wage slavery you must become a massive value provider, or rob a bank.
</p>

What is your intention?
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps rather than just having them accost you randomly, you could infuse some intention into it.
</p>

<p>
	You can choose to infuse infinite love into whatever experience you are having. Evil entities and whatnot should not bother you if you tap into the power of infinite love. You can even say something like, "Be gone devils! I reject your evil ways in the name of love."
</p>

<p>
	All of these astral realm type experiences are what is called the Subtle body. Which is basically the dream realm.
</p>

<p>
	Visualize yourself tapping into infinite love right before bed every night to program your mind to do it when you're in one of these OBE's.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, take ownership of your OBE's. Don't let them turn you into a helpless victim. Don't let evil push you around. Truth and love conquers all.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When I call someone a devil that's very different than when a dualist/moralist calls someone a devil. When I use the label "devil" it is not a personal or moral judgment. It is a matter-of-fact pointing out of unconscious selfishness. When I use the word I understand that the devil is actually God. Most people do not.
</p>

<p>
	That is the difference between dualistic and nondual understanding.
</p>

<p>
	The dualist really feels that evil is real.
</p>

<p>
	The nondualist is conscious that evil is really impossible.
</p>

<p>
	That's because logic is dualistic and reality is nondual.
</p>

<p>
	It is ONLY possible to be deliberately evil while being unconscious.
</p>

<p>
	Go outside and try to crush an ant with your finger while you are simultaneously conscious of the ant's subjective state of mind, it's connection to the entire ecosystem, to the fact that you are the ant, and the ant's inherent beauty. And see what happens.

And ego, even when it is being Machiavellian and deliberately exploitative, is still deeply unconscious and foolish. There certainly are evil, exploitative people in the world. But they are fundamentally ignorant. Which is why they are evil.
</p>

<p>
	Like Trump and his cronies. They are rigging the system. But they are all deeply ignorant.
</p>

<p>
	That what selfishness is! Ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is not really a personal thing, it is a force of nature. And in this sense, it's all part of the structure and unfolding of the universe. Evil people cannot help but be evil because they are ignorant.

</p>

<p>
	It's not that enlightened people are lazy, it's that unenlightened people are deluded. Deluded people do foolish things, like competing, because they are not wise enough to see it is delusion.
</p>

<p>
	You are a mouse running in wheel chasing an imaginary piece of cheese. When someone comes along and points this out to you, you say, "But if I stop I will just be a lazy mouse who sits still. I must keep running until I'm dead."
</p>

<p>
	That is the tragedy of your predicament. You are so mesmerized by life that you refuse to stop and question it. "No time to stop, I've got important cheese to chase."
</p>

<p>
	You are creating a false dichotomy between being enlightened vs working. You can do both and in fact enlightenment will make you extremely effective at anything you choose to do. The best scientists will be enlightened ones.

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not a measure of nonduality. It is a measure of cognitive, emotional, moral, and cultural development.
</p>

<p>
	This  a very important distinction.
</p>

<p>
	You can be fully nondual but still at a low level of development. Development is distinct from states of consciousness and you are not going to attain a high level of development merely by sitting on a cushion.

<p>
	Lol, of course! That is survival!
</p>

<p>
	The issue is HOW. What is the proper way for mankind to survive?
</p>

<p>
	Every stage of the Spiral is trying to survive, in its own way, blind to all other ways above it.
</p>

<p>
	JP's stage Blue & Orange political solutions are a no-go. His notions of order will actually create more disorder. Because he is not aware of the deeper egoic dynamics which are running the show.

	The only sickening part is the foolishness of people who are clearly engaged in survival but so unaware of it that they don't understand the imperatives of survival and thus the importance of good governance.

I have heard from people that it worked for them. It really depends on the person. Seems like it works best on people who are already close to awakening. It doesn't work so well on random Joe Shmo off the street corner.
</p>

<p>
	I even scheduled a Shaktipat session once. But then I refused it at the last minute because my purpose was to prove out 5-MeO-DMT and Kriya yoga for the benefit of others. God indeed works in mysterious ways. I do not regret it. I will take 5-MeO over Shaktipat.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with Shaktipat is that you are giving all of your power away to someone else. This is a strategic blunder in my book. What happens when it does not take you all the way? You need more reliable tools. Try it, but have a solid practice in place.

<p>
	"The prophet Mohammed, who, when one day he saw a Bedouin leaving his camel without tethering it, questioned him as to why he was doing this. The Bedouin replied that he was placing his trust in Allah and had no need to tie the camel. The prophet Mohammed then replied, 'Tie your camel and place your trust in Allah.' "
</p>

<p>
	Politics is the domain of survival. If I was to drive a dump truck full of toxic chemicals to your house and dump it on your front lawn, you would not say, "Okay, no problem. It's perfect." You would say, "No! This should be against the law. Stop polluting my lawn." And thus regulation was born.
</p>

<p>
	"Trust in God, but tie your camel."
</p>

<p>
	Another illustrative story:
</p>

<p>
	A holy man fell off the side of a large ship and was drowning in the sea. He started to pray for God to save him. Over and over again the crew tossed out life preservers to the drowning man, but over and over again he refused because his faith was so strong that he knew God would save him. Finally he drowned. When he arrived in Heaven he saw God and started yelling at him: "I was your most faithful servant! Why didn't you save me from drowning?!!!" And God replied, "I threw you the life preserver over and over again."

An enormous amount of evolutionary development has happened in the last 2000 years of human civilization.
</p>

<p>
	Your view of evolution is very materialist and limited.
</p>

<p>
	Evolution is NOT a biological process happening through DNA. Evolution is a universal process happening through every single movement of every molecule through every scale of order, from the subatomic to cellular to the cultural to the galactic.
</p>

<p>
	You grossly underestimate how much reality has changed in the last 10,000 years and are taking many evolutionary developments completely for granted, like the invention of mathematics, science, language, history, psychology, biology, logic, government, laws, human rights, education, housing, etc. None of these things were a given. They all had to evolve through lots of conflict and struggle.
</p>

<p>
	The human race has solved billions of problems. Which is why you can sit there and enjoy a life of non-slavery, or why you even think you are a biological organism. You are taking your current Spiral stage completely for granted. As if humans like you were just born 10,000 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	Life does not stand still! Evolution is at work, and it has a particular direction: towards increasing consciousness. Life is not some random accident. In the next 1000 years human society will change so radically it will be unrecognizable and horrifying to most egos. Luckily, they'll be long dead.

	Consider the possibility that actual vs not-actual is a conceptual duality you created.
</p>

<p>
	What is this thing you call "actual"? Are you actual?
</p>

<p>
	What is the difference between an actual demon and a non-actual demon?

<p>
	Reality is one system. There is nothing to check it but itself.
</p>

<p>
	The only check to pathological government is healthy government. There both is and is not a check on government. Government is the result of egos enslaving other egos, but then softened by egos voting to make the government more healthy. It's a complex strange loop. Once you are assimilated, you have some say in how the super-organism should work.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, order and disorder, freedom and regulation are the yin-yang. That is the dualistic play of God.
</p>

<p>
	We need to not only check the small egos, we need to check the large corporate egos. Without regulation there will be corporate enslavement. This is already the case. The problem with corporations, unlike individual humans, is that I'm not sure how conscious they can be. A human can become enlightened or at least do spiritual practice. A human has a conscience and sense of morality. A corporation... not so much. At least not in their current configuration.
</p>

<p>
	Corporations make this whole game more tricky because there are 4 entities now within this super-organism: humans, corporations, local governments, and national governments. All 4 need to figure out a way to play together nicely. And then there is global governance of all nations to be considered. The challenge is how to best integrate them all. There are no easy black and white answers. The solutions are nuanced, complex, and really a topic for scientific research.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that stage Blue/Orange people have very simplistic answers which will not possibly work -- they have already run their course. Stage Green is much better, but still not integral enough. Stage Yellow is what we really need most urgently, but to get to Yellow, we need more people at Green.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	High quality science-based regulation is exactly the solution. We regulate those parts of society which behave too egotistically and are hurting the whole.
</p>

<p>
	Government is an agreement between people to regulate each other for the good of all. That's what government is! The answer to bad government is always better, more scientific, more precise government. Not less government. Government must grow as the complexity of the human super-organism grows.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot have a highly complex organism (human society) without strict rules and regulations. Regulations actually enable high degrees of complexity. You cannot have a human body if each cell says "Fuck you, regulation is bad, freedom!" Then you have chaos.
</p>

<p>
	Freedom IS chaos! Order is regulation.
</p>

<p>
	What people do not understand is that humans are not individuals, we are a hive mind and all future forms of the human super-organism will involve higher and higher degrees of integration until eventually there will not be human individuals are all! It will be one collective mind integrating human brains with super AI and all kinds of other technology into one giant mega-conscious integral super-organism. For that to happen, you gotta get over yourself.
</p>

<p>
	This is not about you. This is about YOU! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	In the end, you will be assimilated, over your cold body if necessary. Because that is what evolution is. It integrates, then sub-framents, then integrates, then sub-fragments like a fractual to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	You have no choice about any of this. It will happen whether you resist it or not. The ego always loses.
</p>

<p>
	JP and his egotistical followers will all be integrated in the end.
</p>

<p>
	He is not so innocent. He's polarizing people against Green. If all he did was help elevate low Blue to high Blue that would not be a problem. But what he is doing is entrenching Blue deeper into Blue by giving them an out-group to hate: Green.
</p>

<p>
	JP demonizes Green to gain the love and money of Blue. This is not just done innocently. It is a shrewd marketing tactic. The only way someone like JP becomes as popular as he is, is by being deliberately controversial and polarizing.
</p>

<p>
	Many of JP's viewers don't even realize his teachings are a Trojan horse for a stage Blue value system. They lack any capacity to make such fine distinctions.

	Fear-mongering and moral crusading is a classic stage Blue recruitment tool.
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention how JP's philosophy makes young men hate women.
</p>

<p>
	JP is not popular because he helps evolve Blue people but because his philosophy is the perfect excuse for Blue people to never evolve. The Blue ego seeks sources to tell it that Blue is best and there is no higher to go. Blue has this need and Blue will pull out their wallet to pay for it being met.
</p>

<p>
	Trashing JP is not the point. The point is to be aware of the Trojan horse.

<p>
	You guys should really contemplate this one deeply. There's a lot here.
</p>

<p>
	It takes an enormous leap in consciousness for a caveman to understand that a finger pointing at a deer actually means "look at over there". Or that a finger can even be used to point.
</p>

<p>
	The entire notion of "pointing" is non-obvious and had to be invented.
</p>

<p>
	A rabbit does not know what pointing is. You can point your finger at the rabbit all day long but he will not understand that you are pointing to the wolf sneaking up behind him. Because you invented pointing while the rabbit didn't.
</p>

<p>
	How is it possible (at all) that you can take a thing (finger) to mean something it is obviously not ("look over there").
</p>

			Leo, you are absolutely right those are very serious issues. And I care about those things. To me, JP is pointing to those top capitalist who are using their influence to use propaganda in the media and lobby the government in an effort to create a totalitarian system. I think JP and libertarianism sprang up for this reason. Even JP in his book talks about not being an ideologue about anything. I went through a phase of libertarianism, watched some Milton Friedman material, I felt it was necessary to really understand the effect of individualism, but I also saw its limitations. Which I believe there is an alternative to the capitalism we have now and the communism that happened then.

<p>
	Libertarianism is a stage Orange trap. It will not solve those social issues. It will actually worsen them.
</p>

<p>
	You are NOT going to curb pollution by deregulation. You will only get more pollution.
</p>

<p>
	In a free marketplace, ego will exploit, dominate, monopolize, and enslave everyone it can, until it stopped by use of force.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarianism is fundamentally untenable because it does not understand how ego works, how exploitative ego is.
</p>

<p>
	If allowed, ego will enslave and rape. The history books are filled with that.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot tame the ego to good behavior through reason and moral principles, as libertarians imagine. State use of force is absolutely required.
</p>

<p>
	Anarchism is even more naive and foolish than libertarianism.

One trip will be worth 100 hours of my videos. Of course, it's precisely because this vehicle is so effective that most people do not want to use it. Because it was never their desire to wake up. The biggest bottleneck in this work is desire. People just don't desire to understand reality deeply. And so they never do.
</p>

<p>
	You tend to get from life exactly what you desire. Weak desire, wrong desire results in a weak life, wrong life.

<p>
	It's not a valid concern because: A) no mainstream person anywhere is advocating communism or Marxism, B) stage Green is not communism. There is not a single communist elected official in America.
</p>

<p>
	You have to start to become aware of capitalist propaganda. It goes almost unnoticed in the US.
</p>

<p>
	Read some Noam Chomsky if you want to understand how this propaganda game works.
</p>

<p>
	Valid political concerns would be: gross income inequality, corporate corruption of government through lobbying and dark money, the military-industrial complex pushing for endless wars and arms deals, 50,000+ people dying every year from corporate pushing of prescription opioid drugs, and environmental pollution which gives people cancer and disease.
</p>

<p>
	These are real measurable issues that kill tens of thousands of people very year. These issues need solutions which stage Blue & Orange cannot provide. Only Green+ can attempt to solve those problems.

</p>

<p>
	Which is why the alt-right is so obsessed with cucking. It's a projection of their own fears.
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing original about this value system. It's been the dominant value system for over 1000 years. But now it is dying in Western democratic countries all over the world. But Blue will not let it go. Hence people JP construct a clingy ideology to counteract the inevitable.

<p>
	By JP's logic we should abolish capitalism and install socialism.
</p>

<p>
	JP is bitching about sexual inequality while being completely oblivious of the most glaring inequality in society: money & power!
</p>

<p>
	The entire argument for socialism is that the money and power hierarchy has become way too steep to the point of destabilizing society.
</p>

<p>
	Yet all of this is totally lost on JP as he worries about feminists robbing men of the sexual power they amassed over centuries of stage Blue patriarchy.
</p>

<p>
	The way a stage Blue ego-mind works is, it is hyper-sensitive to the dangers of new progressive ideas, but totally in denial of the destabilizing dangers of the status quo. Because fundamentally, stage Blue ego is fighting to defend the status quo regardless of what the status quo is or does. That is Blue's agenda. That is JP's agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Somehow tens of millions of poor wage slaves is okay, but tens of thousands of sexually incompetent incels is a giant problem in need of a socialist-like redistribution of vagina. How convenient that redistribution of power is totally fine, and even paramount, so long as the power is being redistributed back to the top of the old Blue hierarchy. The top on which JP and his fanboys would like to make their nest.
</p>

<p>
	JP is a rooster squawking because his roost is being removed.

<p>
	Joe pokes holes in JP's bullshit Blue value system very quickly.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to sound coherent when you're speaking to a crowd of angsty young white males age 18-24 who have never bothered to seriously study politics, feminism, government, post-modernism, socialism, philosophy, metaphysics, epistemology, psychology, science, sociology, history, religion, mysticism, or self-help.
</p>

<p>
	All you gotta do is tell them what they want to hear and to their ego-mind it will sound coherent.
</p>

<p>
	Also, eloquence has nothing to do with truth, reality, development level, or consciousness. The most eloquent people are usually full of shit.

It's about the level of depth one grasps it at.
</p>

<p>
	As I have said many times before -- but people refuse to hear me -- there are incredible degrees of depth to this work. Whatever you think you've understood or grasped, you can understand and grasp it 1000x deeper.
</p>

<p>
	People mislead themselves by looking for new topics, new teachings, new experiences, when what is really most paramount is grasping old vanilla teaching more fully.
</p>

<p>
	How deeply do you understand what existence is?
</p>

<p>
	That is the key thing.
</p>

<p>
	Well, at least this shows you are starting to question existence. Which is the most important point. Of course none of the above is actual conscious, it's more just your mind starting to realize that conventional knowledge is a farce.
</p>

<p>
	Reality did not come out of nothing. It is nothing. Something and nothing are identical. The mistake is seperating the two, holding them as opposites.

This was specifically related to arguments with false equivalence being the fallacy. I think it's in fact kind of lazy. <img alt=":)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/smile@2x.png 2x" title=":)" width="20" />

		<p>
			There is a large difference between an islamist fundamentalist and a harvard lawyer. If you compare those two with the comparison of two other random people, there's no difference in the amount of difference. But it depends what difference we're comparing those two on.
		</p>

		<p>
			In the wikipedia example, it was between the suitability of pet between a snail and a cat.

		<p>
			Here's one of spilling oil:
		</p>

		<p>
			 
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is no different from your neighbor dripping some oil on the ground when changing oil in his car."</strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			<em>(the comparison is between things differing by many orders of magnitude: Deepwater Horizon spilled 210 million US gal; 780,000 m3 of oil, your neighbor might spill perhaps a pint.)</em>
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	All of this is purely subjective and relative -- a construction of your mind.
</p>

<p>
	The differences are large and significant only because your ego says so.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how you sneak your egoic agenda into the discussion to help you convince yourself that you have a winning argument here. The oil spill only matters because you think it matters to your survival. The oil spill is a positive thing from the perspective of bacteria that thrive off eating the dead animals killed by the spill.
</p>

<p>
	All argument is ego, not truth.

	It does not have to be that way. That's the way of lazy sheep.
</p>

<p>
	That happens to people because they never do personal development.
</p>

<p>
	Senility is not just some random affliction. It is caused by things like improper diet, improper use of one's mind and body, and improper lifestyle.

<p>
	Well, it does vary from person to person, but yeah, that's generally how it feels. You start to feel like you're inside a dream, everything is consciousness, and you are God looking through your own eyes.
</p>

<p>
	What once felt like a solid, heavy, material, physical reality now feels like an airy, intelligent, living, fluid field of spirit.
</p>

<p>
	Your body just becomes an extension of your mind.

</p>

<p>
	You can function very well from abiding nondual awareness. But not so much on a 5-MeO peak. The 5-MeO peak is too nondual to be practical for everyday living. Which is precisely why normal and even enlightened people are not that conscious 24/7. At a certain point you can become so conscious that there is no world any more.

<p>
	It's very common to have brief glimpses of nonduality and then fall back into duality.
</p>

<p>
	But after a certain point, after enough glimpses, something should crack in you and then nonduality becomes your permanent way of seeing the world.

<p>
	Much of academic psychology is pretty crude. It certainly won't incorporate spiritual or mystical insights. But there's some value in it.
</p>

<p>
	What you really want is transpersonal psychology, humanistic psychology, positive psychology.
</p>

<p>
	Or just straight up spirituality, mysticism, and nonduality.

	Nice quote.

<p>
	Yes. Whitehead was the kind of scientific mind which is rarely seen these days.
</p>

<p>
	His later works are quite good. He understood the ignorance of positivism, materialism, and reductionism.
</p>

<p>
	It's like modern scientists are going through an idiocracy phase.

			but how does being on lsd or 5meo make it less hallucinatory?

<p>
	It doesn't. It just makes you aware that you are inside a hallucination whereas previously you weren't.
</p>

<p>
	It makes you aware of the full ramifications of your own logic, because right now you still aren't.

<p>
	Teens in native tribal cultures do psychedelics all the time, and have been doing it for over 5000 years.
</p>

<p>
	Case closed.
</p>

<p>
	What's really damaging is all the TV you watch, all the video games you play, and all the garbage junk food you eat. Why ain't you worried about that?

So by your own thought process, your entire thought process is contingent on an arbitrary soup of chemicals. According to you, all human knowledge is a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	And you are right. But if you are right, that means the brain, chemicals, the body, the universe, and science are also hallucinations. It even means that you being right is also a hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	So what now? Anything you think or do is a hallucination (according to you).
</p>
