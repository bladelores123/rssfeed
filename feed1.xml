Pranayama is really the heart of the practice. Everything else is secondary.
</p>

<p>
	Focus on learning the spinal breathing. Really master it. That is the key to it all.

<title>Examples of Zen Devils?</title>

<p>
	True, but think of the image from a PR perspective:
</p>

<p>
	CNN Breaking News: "Enlightened master beats follower with sharp stick and enjoys it. What a monster!" <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is, the enlightened master doesn't have a problem with his anger. It's the outside world that judges him. And unfortunately for him, the outside world ain't as enlightened as he is.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru has been accused of murder and holding followers hostage in his cult. I've been accused of being a pedophile. So yeah... if you're gonna be enlightened, you need to develop a stomach for being misunderstood.
</p>

It basically lets them use human beings as guinea pigs without repercussions. That bill prohibits the FDA from collecting any statistics on people who die from those trial treatments. So drug companies can feed sick patients experimental new drugs, and if those patients die or become even more sick, the government is legally prohibited from collecting and using that data against the drug companies. It's a very clever bit of law.

<p>
	That's generally correct. Except, enlightened masters are also humans, and can also get triggered and get angered in an unconscious way. Just because you're enlightened does not mean you're in control of your emotions 24/7. Enlightened masters also get horny. So watch out <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	If you poke someone with a sharp stick long enough -- even Sadhguru -- he will probably get angry and beat you with it.

<p>
	In personal correspondences with Martin I have asked him about whether he thinks smoking 5-MeO can cause any kind of energetic or psychological damage. And he just flatly says No.
</p>

<p>
	I disagree about that. I think 5-MeO, especially smoked in large doses, if one is unprepared, can cause energetic and psychological damage. So I would be very cautious. Rectal administration is much safer, especially for newbies.
</p>

<p>
	You also need to take into account that Octavio has done like 10,000 of these psychedelic ceremonies. So you have to reasonably ask yourself, if 1 out of 5,000 sessions going bad is really that bad of a ratio. With psychedelics as powerful as 5-MeO, I would expect 1 out of 1,000 people to have serious negative side effects. So it's complicated.
</p>

<p>
	1/1,000 surgeries certainly goes really bad.
</p>

<p>
	Smoking 5-MeO for someone who isn't ready for it, is gonna be in for a wild ride. Hell, I don't even dare to smoke it.
</p>

<p>
	Well... about that Martin clip... you see... no matter how enlightened you are, you can still get angry. In fact, Zen masters are famous for their fits of anger.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightened rage, they call it <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Newbies often confuse enlightenment for saintliness, and that just isn't the case. It is possible to be an enlightened prick. Of course, it's also possible to be an unenlightened prick. So how do you tell the difference?
</p>

<p>
	Corruption is common among even highly enlightened yogis and masters in all traditions.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if 5-MeO is being administered by these people in a forced or dangerous way, that is not good. They could be doing that whether they are enlightened or not. Of course I have no idea if any of these rumors are true. From my limited interactions with Martin, he seems legit and he has a good heart. Of course I have no idea how he behaves behind closed doors.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Being is prior to doubt. Doubt is constructed out of being.
</p>

<p>
	Also, if you become conscious of Infinity, you simultaeously become everything that has ever existed, past, present, and future. Your being is so total that you realize you are every possible thing that could ever be. It is beyond all possible doubt. You realize that you exist as every doubt that every living creature in the entire universe has ever had, and infinitely more.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are God, this is no doubt you are God. Hence it's called awakening. You are 100% awake to the entire functioning of the universe. Nothing is hidden from your awareness. You realize there is no place for anything to hide. There is nothing behind the scenes. Everything is seen to be precisely what it is, without reliance on experience or knowledge. It is omniscience. But it is nonverbal, so you cannot speak it.
</p>

<p>
	It was a growth experience for sure.

<p>
	But I still don't know which is better. I just know that I like spinal breathing, pulling prana up my spine. Sadhguru aparently doesn't teach that.

</p>

<p>
	Then I replaced most of his techniques with Pranayama.
</p>

<p>
	Different strokes for different folks I guess.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the question is not whether his yoga is good, but whether Kriya is better. I cannot say definitively, but I had to make a choice. I like Kriya more. But I have not done Sadhguru's advanced trainings, so I cannot speak to that. Maybe he has some killer advanced techniques? I dunno.
</p>

<p>
	Also, I interviewed one of his advanced students and when I asked him about enlightenment, he said, "I don't know what enlightenment is", which was a big red flag for me. I highly doubt most of his advanced students are enlightened. But I could be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big difference between doing yoga and being enlightened.

			My understanding is because non-existance by its very nature and definition means that "it doesnt exist" it applies to itself as "non-existence", leaving only the possible thing "existance" to remain.

			But the emptiness is full of non-existent and existent information, that's what I meant. Everything that is not within your awareness is non-existent to you.

<p>
	No, what I am trying to communicate to you is that Nothingness is existence.
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness is NOT non-existence. This is a very important point:
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness exists!
</p>

<p>
	You're still not realizing that non-existence is a concept, which is occurs within existence.

Which is why so few folks are enlightened. You should figure, if something is so rare that 1 in a million people have it, there must be a catch. And that's the catch.
</p>

<p>
	The good news is, there's nothing to fear about death. It's a marvelous thing. Your experiences of suffering were not death, they were life! Be careful not to project that onto enlightenment. Whatever suffering or fear you experienced, that was not enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire post is an expression of fear. That is perfectly normal, but start to notice that it's just fear. You fear pursuing enlightenment, and you fear not pursuing enlightenment. Yes, that's normal. That will need to be resolved with time. Be patient. Allow yourself time.
</p>

<p>
	You are more powerful than you give yourself credit. The way out of your dilemma is to keep doing the practices and growing. As you grow, your fears will dissolve more and more, gradually. Do more trips and see that death is nothing to fear.
</p>

<p>
	Just because right now you feel that you are not strong enough to surrender, doesn't mean it will always be that way. Right now you are weak, but a month from today you might become strong. You don't know how strong you are yet. So don't worry about it too much.
</p>

<p>
	For now, just very practically, I would say: focus on your daily practices: yoga, meditation, self-inquiry. The beauty of yoga is that it will build up your strength and gradually dissolve your fears, so that surrender becomes easy.
</p>

It's actually beyond knowledge or experience, you are it. You are the Absolute. You can't get any more direct than that. When you're at infinite consciousness, there is no doubt. Doubt is an activity of the mind.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can go to the Absolute and then fall back down into the relative. That's mostly what happens after a trip. But the Absolute was nevertheless the Absolute while you were in it. And really, it's still here. It hasn't gone anywhere. You're just disconnected from it. Like clouds temporary blotting out the sun. The sun is always there shining. Even on a cloudy day.
</p>

<p>
	Even if I achieved full Buddhahood, nothing for you would change. You would still not know if I was deluded or wrong. There is only one way for you to know the Truth, and that is to awaken for yourself. That is the only way. Yes, from your POV I could be wrong, mistaken, deluded. Then again, maybe it's you who are wrong, mistaken, deluded?
</p>

<p>
	I'll tell you what the rest of life is like after I live it. I am a work in progress and there is still much I have to discover about this whole process of awakening. But I can tell you for sure that the Absolute exists, and you can discover it for yourself, and it's more amazing than anything you could imagine.

<p>
	I think they can be life-changing, although personally, to me, I found his yoga not as potent as the Kriya we're discussing here. It probably gets more potent as you go to his advanced programs, but his introductory program didn't seem potent enough for my liking. It would make sense to me that he, being very responsible, would save the most potent techniques only for his most advanced students. And I don't like jumping through all those hoops to get the most potent techniques. I want something I can learn at home on my own. Hence I prefer Kriya. But this not to say you shouldn't do his programs or that his teachings are bad. He's knows what he's doing. He has to be very careful about taking his yoga to millions of people. At those scales, a lot of things can go wrong, so you have to teach very responsibly and focus on safety.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking, the more mainstream a teaching gets, the more watered down it gets.

<p>
	There is no such thing as non-existence, only existence. Non-existence is a concept existing in your mind.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness, existence, and Nothingness are all the same thing, but this "Nothingness" is not non-existence, it is existence. Existence is, and it is empty. Then it can get filled with all kinds of forms, one of which is the concept of non-existence.
</p>

<p>
	Existence has no opposite. It only feels like it does because the ego-mind creates a conceptual "should", telling itself, "But why doesn't X exist?" But that is existence!
</p>

<p>
	"Non-existence" exists within existence.

<p>
	There is no such thing as non-being. Even after the body dies, you will still not escape being. Being is infinite and eternal. So you're stuck being whether you like it or not. So might as well surrender to it.
</p>

<p>
	By "Being" I don't mean "your life", or some way that you are, I mean the substance of reality.

<p>
	Experience - ego = Being

			Being does not have an absolute point, value or meaning. But there is definitely a relative point, value, and meaning that might or might not be created by ego-minds. To boil all points, value and meanings as simply ego-mind self-preservation is kind of dumb unless you mean it in an absolute sense. You know you're beyond of knowing that for sure, that's why you're so uncertain of your writing.
		</p>

		<p>
			Play some music. Lying about your experience is ego-mind trying to fulfill a specific story and not tell what the experience is.
		</p>

		<p>
			You're really telling an ego to look around the room and notice every object has no value or meaning. The fact that I have a chair in my room is due to an attribute of its meaning beyond the ego-mind. You don't understand why you're typing here or writing to each other. Is your pursuit of enlightenment, being a sage, and teaching, meaningless? You don't know. Does a hunter 300,000 years ago think about what the point of the spear does, or why he aims it? He doesn't know. That's what Thinker ego-mind does. Do you think about the computer or the chair? Or science?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not dumb. It's what is. Meaning and value are inventions -- and you are still obviously resisting this by playing these clever mind-games.
</p>

<p>
	You haven't yet become conscious of what Being or meaning are. Careful with that arrogance. It's keeping you from growing.
</p>

<p>
	You would greatly benefit from doing that exercise for a month or two.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, what we are talking about is switching orientation from living from the relative to the Absolute. Which requires becoming conscious that meaning is an invention of your mind.

It's a skill that must be developed with practice.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to solve this problem by sitting at home on your couch.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can also be helpful. They will reveal to you how to be authentic. Then you can carry those lessons over into social life. I found mushrooms to be good for this issue. They make you more playful, uninhibited, and goofy.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, it's a bit paradoxical.
</p>

<p>
	I like to experiment and tinker with stuff and do things my way. I accept the risks.
</p>

<p>
	For newbies I suggest you pick a book/school and stick with it.
</p>

<p>
	I don't think the differences between the two books is as great as it might seem. It's variations on the same basic thing. There are dozens of schools of yoga because in practice, people end up making tweaks and variations to suit themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Because most yoga is taught dogmatically, many schools sorta lie to their students that "You must do it perfectly the way I teach it, or it will not work". But this seems obviously false since there are many different masters from many different schools. So there's clearly some degree of leeway. The question is, when have you taken it too far? And that cannot be easily answered. You will only know by trail and error.

			What about the sentence "Life is suffering" that all the religious people have always talked about? Isn't that more accurate than pointless, valueless, and meaningless? The latter three seem like emotions to me, for example, the experience of meaning can be quietness of self-referential thoughts or a piece of Music.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Life is suffering from the ego-mind's POV.
</p>

<p>
	What the religious people meant when they said "Life is suffering" is "Ordinary materialistic life is suffering" and that this can be transcended with deep enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	BEING is pointless, valueless, and meaningless. This is not an emotional statement. This is as factual as it gets. This is really not different from what physics would tell you: atoms do not have value or meaning.
</p>

<p>
	It's actually a very important milestone in the spiritual journey for you to realize that BEING is meaningless. The ego-mind creates meaning to enable self-preservation to happen. Suffering cannot end unless meaning is realized to be an illusion. Suffering comes from the mind's pursuit of meaning and value.
</p>

<p>
	Here's the 1st exercise from A Course In Miracles Workbook: Look around the room and notice that every object has no value or meaning. Like, you see a chair. What does a chair mean? Nothing.
</p>

<p>
	It's a very simple but powerful exercise. Keep doing it.

<p>
	Yes, it's challenging to rewire your motivations. At deep levels of consciousness you realize that everything is pointless, valueless, and meaningless. So there's really no reason to do anything. And this can feel depressing and demotivating for a while. But that's true detachment. You just have to give yourself time and find ways to ground yourself. You can build up some healthy ambitions over time which are based on a higher purpose, even though you know purpose is an invention.
</p>

<p>
	It can be tricky. Make sure you give yourself time. Don't make any rash decisions or actions. And trust that if you're in a depressive funk, that will not last forever. You will pull out of it with time.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest mistake people make when they are depressed is that they assume this depression will last forever. It will not.
</p>

<p>
	I think the way this problem is overcome in a tradition such as Zen is through rigorous habits and discipline. After enlightenment, the laundry. It's a grounding exercise.
</p>

<p>
	I do a mix of Pranayama 2 + the Pranayama described in Gamana's book.
</p>

<p>
	You can play around with different versions, the essence is the same. I like to visualize energy flowing up the spine to the very top of the head through all the charkas. I think the more precise your visualization gets, the better.
</p>

<p>
	Gamana says not to visualize the energy flowing up each chakra, but I feel it's more powerful to visualize it. I find that doing a detailed visualization also helps stabilize and focus the monkey mind.
</p>

<p>
	Experiment around and see what works best for you.

<title>Truth doesn't exist, here's how!</title>

You're still trying to reason this out intellectually, and that will not work.
</p>

<p>
	Stop theorizing and do the practices with an open mind. (Right now, your mind is not open.)
</p>

<p>
	The situation is the exact opposite what you think: Truth is all there is. There is no such thing as non-Truth. Non-Truth does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of spiritual practice is that it IS possible to transcend experience. Experience is not all there is. Experience is a 2nd order phenomena. 1st order is BEING, which requires no experiencer. Experience is a dualistic notion, which is why it must be transcended.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness, experience will become recontextualized into Absolute Being. Nothing visual will change. But a radical recontextualization will happen once the ego is seen to be non-existent. You will realize that what you used to call "experience" was really Absolute Being the whole time, you just weren't conscious of it because the ego was in the way.
</p>

<title>How to find the root of the truth?</title>

</p>

<p>
	For example, when was the last time you did a 10 day retreat?
</p>

<p>
	Do you do yoga every day?
</p>

<p>
	Do you do psychedelics?
</p>

<p>
	That's where the results are. Simple but tangible stuff like that.
</p>

<p>
	Theory -- while important and necessary -- produces very little results.
</p>

<p>
	I would tweak that to say: the goal is to be joyful with whatever is.
</p>

<p>
	So if you're feeling crummy, be joyful about it. It sounds paradoxical, and it is, but it's not.

<title>The Infinite Why</title>

<p>
	The why is, you want to feel good, feel complete.
</p>

<p>
	If you felt complete right now, you would not want anything.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that every day, you feel incomplete. Your entire life, you've felt incomplete. So you chase things which you think will make you feel complete.
</p>

<p>
	But it never works, because completeness is an existential insight, not a material object.
</p>

<p>
	This is because, you are disconnected from who/what you are existentially. Completeness can only come with existential understanding.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like if you imagined you should have 3 arms, but you only saw you have 2. So you'd go looking to acquire a 3rd arm to feel complete. But the counter-intuitive move is not to go chop off someone's arm and stitch it to your chest, but to realize: "Oh!!!! Duh!!! I should only have 2 arms! So everything is perfect! <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" /> "
</p>

<p>
	Happiness is wanting exactly what you presently have.
</p>

<p>
	Unhappiness is wanting something you don't presently have.
</p>

<p>
	It's that simple. But not easy to really grok. The mind will not just surrender its wants. That requires enlightenment. Your very life is tied to your wants. The reason you want anything is because you want to stay alive. So the really counter-intuitive move is to say, "I want to die."
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I don't advise 5-MeO for people who have never done milder psychedelics. AL-LAD is great for newbies but still very powerful.

<title>Kriya Yoga Mega-Thread</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	For those of you into Kriya, I would highly recommend that in addition to reading the original Kriya book I suggested, you also read the books of Santata Gamana. I now prefer his more simplified techniques. It's a much more streamlined version of Kriya which I think will be even more effective. I found too much needless complexity and variety in the other way.
</p>

<p>
	Right now my technique stack is very simple:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Mahamudra x3
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Pranayama x24
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Supreme Fire x3
	</li>
	<li>
		One-pointed Concentration for 5 mins
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	Eventually, with lots of practice, you should aim for something like the following stack:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>
		Mahamudra x3
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Pranayama x36-x72
	</li>
	<li>
		Kriya Supreme Fire for 10-20 mins
	</li>
	<li>
		One-pointed Concentration for 10-20 mins
	</li>
	<li>
		(Bonus: Yoni Mudra x3)
	</li>
	<li>
		(Bonus: Kechari mudra)
	</li>
</ol>

<p>
	EDIT: ideally, do this stack twice per day. But if you don't have that much time, at least once per day.
</p>

<p>
	Don't attempt to do this second stack right off the bat. It will not be sustainable. You need to gradually build up to it, like with heavy weightlifting.
</p>

<p>
	I think the original book I recommended is still very good as an introduction and foundation because Gamana's books are so short and thin that they do not provide enough information about Kriya to a total newbie. They are aimed at people who have already been initiated in one school or another.
</p>

<p>
	If you are strictly following the original book, that is okay. You can keep doing that if you want. Or you could switch to this more streamlined version like I decided to do. I don't like learning too many complicated techniques. But that's just me. Both ways should work in the end. It's mostly a matter of style. Although I actually think the streamlined version will end up to be more effective because it concentrates your limited time on the most powerful techniques, and less time is wasted on learning new complex techniques.
</p>

<title>What's the difference between awareness and consciousness?</title>

<p>
	I usually use those words interchangeably.
</p>

<p>
	Some teachers like to split hairs about it. I prefer not to because it confuses people.
</p>

<p>
	Suffice it to say, if you knew what awareness/consciousness was, you'd be enlightened. It cannot be explained in words.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is awareness/consciousness. But you are not aware/conscious of what awareness/consciousness is!
</p>

<p>
	If you want to become aware/conscious, place your awareness/consciousness on awareness/consciousness itself for a long time without distraction. Eventually the true nature of awareness/consciousness will dawn. And that will be enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	It does no good to ask people what awareness/consciousness is. You must observe it directly in your experience. There is the answer.
</p>

<p>
	No, it does not.
</p>

<p>
	You are misunderstanding what consciousness is.
</p>

<p>
	You haven't actually had a direct experience of what nonduality means. You're intellectualizing it.
</p>

<p>
	I know an enlightened master who took 1000ug of LSD after his enlightenment to test himself. He was unable to tell the difference between night and day. But his grounding in Nothingness was unshaken.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness isn't a product of the brain. The brain is a form within consciousness, and as consciousness is the only thing there is, it is self-interactive.

<p>
	A rock hitting you in the head and causing a bruise is consciousness (a rock) interacting with consciousness (your head) causing a change in consciousness (a bruise).

<p>
	1) Ego backlash
</p>

<p>
	2) Sex drive is hard to just stop. In fact you bascially can't. The only way to transcend it is through lots of conscious spiritual puriffication work. I wouldn't worry about sex too much. Don't try to suppress it. Learn to accept it and to fulfill it in healthy ways.

Most work is just a waste of time and life.
</p>

<p>
	There are other options to the conventional rat race. You could join an ashram or commune.
</p>

<p>
	I have a friend who didn't want to work so he joined the Hare Krishna commune in Tennessee.
</p>

<p>
	I don't necessarily endorse that. Communes can have lots of issues of their own, but it's certainly one viable possibility. Research your options. Stop thinking inside the rat race box.

<p>
	Reality doesn't work by chance at all. It only seems that way when the linear materialistic mind cannot fathom nonlinear infinity.
</p>

<p>
	When a scientist says "chance" or "random", what he really means is: "It's too complex for me to figure out in detail. And I don't want to admit it because I know best and science knows all. So chance."

<p>
	You have to take into account that the people in solitary confinement are already very mentally dysfunction. Many of them are violent offenders and probably have mental illnesses. So solitary for them only makes things worse.
</p>

<p>
	They also do not know how to meditate or self-inquire, or that this is even an option.

<p>
	Just to be clear, I will not be sitting still the whole time like the story of the Buddha. In fact, I am sort of over the whole Zen formal sitting thing. I do not care how I sit or if I move.
</p>

<p>
	My #1 priority will be surrendering of the mind and maintaining contentration on the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	I've sort of stopped caring at this point about using formal techniques. I just sit and focus on the immediate present moment and the fact that consciousness is happening.
</p>

<p>
	I will also be doing lots of 5-MeO to definitively demonstrate its permanent enlightenment potential.
</p>

<p>
	My goal is to show that 5-MeO is the best tool for awakening, along with just sitting and surrendering. I want to demonstrate that 5-MeO can permanently rewire the "brain". It was already done so for me, but now we will take it to the next level.
</p>

<p>
	I want to accomplish what the Buddha accomplished, but using 5-MeO. Or to show that it isn't possible.
</p>

<p>
	I don't hate Mooji.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing I said was hateful. I was merely pointing out how ego distracts itself from doing the work.
</p>

<p>
	Just because you don't kiss someone's ass doesn't mean you hate him. There is a middle position. 
</p>

<p>
	Respect your teachers, but do not kiss their ass. This isn't complicated. But people love to worship people. Lots of people looking for idealized daddy figures to worship, like Osho.

	That is your naive materialist assumption.

<p>
	A beer having an effect does not prove a brain any more than Super Mario drinking a beer proves he has a brain.

<p>
	The beer is a hallucination. You drinking it is a hallucination. It affecting you is a hallucination. Your brain is a hallucination. YOU are a hallucination. Cause/effect is a hallucination.

<p>
	Because hallucination is all there is.

<title>The cult of Mooji!</title>

<p>
	Of course. That's the case with most gurus, and they get off on it.
</p>

<p>
	Did you really expect people to do the hard work of pursuing their own enlightenments? Nope! The whole point of a spiritual community is to delay enlightenment as long as possible by distractions such as kissing Mooji's ass.

<title>How to be yourself, when you don’t know yourself</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/20851-how-to-be-yourself-when-you-don%E2%80%99t-know-yourself/?do=findComment&amp;comment=222502</link>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Exactly. It's because you don't know yourself that you struggle to be yourself.
</p>

<p>
	What are you really? What do you want from life really? What are your values really?
</p>

<p>
	The point of the inner work is to find out.
</p>

<p>
	The mistake people make here is to assume that because they were born, they should somehow automatically know themselves. Nope! You gotta work for it. It takes several decades of proactive work to come to know yourself.
</p>

The important thing is that you learn the lessons from each mistake. Make sure you are really learning each lesson. Contemplate what each of those mistakes was meant to teach you about life.

	Don't beat yourself up over mistakes. Reframe them as valuable lessons.

<p>
	You didn't pay $5,000 for a stupid tattoo, you paid $5,000 for the life lesson it taught you. What was that $5,000 lesson?

<p>
	Right here you already betray that you know what the right path is, and what the wrong path is.
</p>

<p>
	Waking up is the right path. Falling back asleep is the wrong path.
</p>

<p>
	Don't beat yourself up too much about being 100% on the right path. That is difficult and rare. In practice, you will fall off the path and slide into unconsciousness many times along the way. Maybe when you first start, you will only be 20% on the right path and 80% on the wrong path. That is okay. Just keep your eye on the ultimate vision and keep working the right path. Over time you will build momentum and your percentage will increase from 20% to 30% to 40%, etc.

<p>
	It's not practical because you are not yet conscious of what pain is. You've merely been told about this as a possibility. You haven't done anything yet to actualize it. You might as well complain that earning a million dollars is impractical simply because you've heard it's possible to earn, but you haven't bothered doing any work towards it yet.
</p>

<p>
	If you became conscious of what pain is, the pain would stop being pain.

	How could it not be?

<p>
	Why would pain be fundamentally different from pleasure? Both are just sensations.

<p>
	On this forum, we use the words "awakening" and "enlightenment" interchangeably.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever distinctions you make between those words, are your own idiosyncratic creation.

	Are you sure it was LSD?

<p>
	Laughter could be a phase. It will pass with more tripping.
</p>

<p>
	But get your substance and dosages straight. Don't be relying on stuff some random friend handed you.

<p>

<p>
	More like, your emotional reactivity.
</p>

<p>
	Mood is a terrible measure of growth. Mood changes wildly. You gotta ground yourself in something more long-term and stable. Like Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	The truest measure of growth is how deeply you're grounded in Nothingness/Truth/You. Because Nothingness is the only thing which cannot be destroyed. Everything else is fleeting, including success, joy, health, wealth, relationships, career, friends, reputation, thought, or anything else. Even experience itself will end. But Nothingness will remain forever.

While most people I have asked never experienced anything like that even on the very high doses. What was the reason do you think? It seems like shrooms are taking you wherever and whatever you are ready to see.

<p>
	Of course. It all depends on one's spiritual attunement.

	Psychedelics don't work on dense people.

<title>A Universe from NOTHING?</title>

<p>
	There is no way to get it short of enlightenment. This is the heart of enlightenment. Your mind cannot create a "sneak peak" of enlightenment. A genuine nondual experience is necessary.
</p>

<p>
	Also, thinking about nothingness will not get you to Nothingness. "Figuring it out" will not work. I tried that for several years and I wasn't even close. You are not going to think your way into enlightenment.

<p>
	It will be challenging enough to get people to actually show up in LA.

<p>
	It's one thing to show up online, it's another thing to show up in person. People always have last-minute excuses.

<p>
	It's not from nothing.
</p>

<p>
	It IS nothing!
</p>

<p>
	Important difference which is lost on the scientists.
</p>

<p>
	The universe is as nothing today as it was 14 billion years ago. It's ALWAYS eternally nothing. It can never be anything but nothing. Nothing doesn't become something via time. Time itself is nothing.

</p>

<p>
	So what's the problem? Enjoy illusion for what it is.
</p>

<p>
	Why do you need it to be real? Why must you insist that in order to watch a movie, it has to be footage of actual events that took place in the world?
</p>

<p>
	You see how silly that is?
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of life is that it is a CREATION! You are creating it from scratch! The possibilities of creation are infinite. So enjoy the creation unfold. God pulled all of creation out of his ass, and in fact, he's doing it every millisecond.

<p>
	Nothingness is not what you imagine it to be. It's the opposite.

<p>
	I hesitate to post such videos because it will turn off casual observers. The mind loves to judge things it does not understand.

<p>
	I might create a whole course on psychedelics in the future.

<p>
	1g should be fine.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms are awesome when you do them right.
</p>

<p>
	Even 1g will be the coolest experience of your life, if this is your first time doing psychedelics.
