My heart told me I must pioneer the 5-MeO-DMT path.
</p>

<p>
	But I am not opposed to shaktipat.

<p>
	I think yoga goes all the way up to the highest nondual stage. Depends on which yoga and how you do it.

<p>
	I would not underestimate yogis. They are some hardcore fuckers.

<p>
	I'm about to read a book by a yogi who spent 30 years straight meditating for 8 hours per day. Don't even dare to guess what he became conscious of.

I think awakening must be not only in the head but the whole body. Energetic blockages must be released. Otherwise you might awaken but your embodiment of it will be lacking.

He laughed and said that yogis are not really enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever that means.
</p>

<p>
	The bliss you can definitely experience on psychedelics. Very strong doses of 5-MeO-DMT also activate kundalini although I'm not sure if it's being activated safely. On my highest dose ever of 5-MeO-DMT, the consciousness was so powerful that it was too much to handle and I felt kundalini shoot out of my fingertips like force lightening, resulting in skin damage to my fingertips. It was a very freaky experience bordering on the paranormal. I don't think it was healthy. But damn was it powerful. I have never had kundalini activation on 5-MeO-DMT except that one time. That was a very large dose which I would not want to take again. To be any more conscious you'd be so conscious you'd physically pass out.

Neither of those two ever talk about losing identification, God, Kundalini, etc. unless I am unaware. All their teaching stops at "I-I". Which really is just a step before self-realization. 
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Ralston is a sneaky one. He's very tight-lipped and coy. He deliberately does not mention God, but he's fully aware he is God. He just won't talk about it because (I assume) he's worried it will get the ego-mind churning with religious fantasies. Kundalini he does not talk about. Not sure why. I think he might consider it a distraction, a relative experience. Losing identification is his whole teaching. He clearly has zero identification with anything. You have to really study his work closely to understand his depth. He might be one the most enlightened human beings on the planet. But his teachings are very advanced. He does not over-explain things for newbs like I do AT ALL. You have to really struggle through his teachings to understand their depth. The only way to appreciate Ralston is to study with him face to face. It's quite an experience. He is deeper than a Zen master. He teaches some very advanced things but they all sound so simple you can easily miss it and he don't give a fuck if you do. It's like an advanced graduate college class where the professor just expects you to do all the work. He doesn't even bother to give you homework or tests or explain much.
</p>

<p>
	Seems to me that Rupert Spira also teaches about losing identification, he just might not use that language.
</p>

<p>
	The trick with evaluating teachers is that they might not use the language you use. So you have to give them some leeway. Some teachers develop their own systems which do not use the categories and verbiage of classical traditions like Vedanta or yoga or Buddhism.
</p>

<p>
	Seems to me that it's possible to awaken without having a kundalini awakening experience, thus people who awaken without much kundalini surges might not emphasize it in their teachings. Teachers tend to emphasize their own path to awakening. But there is more than one path because not all human minds/brains/bodies/personalities are the same. Imagine for example what it would be like for an autistic male to awaken versus a super emotional psychic female. They will have VERY different paths even though the ultimate realization of Truth will be similar after the dust settles. There are a lot of psychic people who have very weird and twisted paths to awakening. It's going to be very hard to understand or evaluate them unless you have had those kinds of extra-sensory abilities for your entire life. It's like being a different species of human. Their brains work differently.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine what awakening might have been like for a neanderthal. It is said they may have had bigger brains than humans. Their awakenings would have been different than human awakenings. But of course this does not negate that the Absolute is still the Absolute. People underestimate how much neurology plays a part in the awakening process. This becomes obvious if you do a lot of various psychedelics. You experiences impossible states of consciousness which are totally outside the catalogue of the traditional spiritual literature. Because consciousness can basically be any which way imaginable and there are just things which you will never be able to meditate or self-inquire your way to. Something like saliva you are not going to get through meditation. There are also various kinds of brain-damaged states and brain pathologies which lead to interesting new kinds of consciousness which virtually nobody knows about or understands because all that's really mapped out are the mainstream norms. Not the very weird edge-cases. Imagine what it would be like to awaken as a psychopath or schizophrenic.

</p>

<p>
	What is your experience of Infinity?
</p>

<p>
	For example, are you able to look at an object like a pen and be conscious that it is infinitely deep?
</p>

<p>
	What is your experience of time? Are you conscious that every moment is eternal?
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious of how you create your own body?
</p>

<p>
	What is your consciousness of causation? Are you able to be conscious that every object, like a pen, has an infinite chain of causation leading to its current state?
</p>

<p>
	Just curious which facets you've experienced and how they line up with stuff I've experienced.

</blockquote>

<p>
	What I'm saying aligns with the best spiritual traditions. Almost all of them talk about degrees of awakening. So it's not an ego thing. I don't really care about being more awakened than someone else. I just care about not missing some important insight which I might easily overlook if I wasn't careful and comprehensive. I would rather err on the side of comprehensiveness. Because I can't anticipate everything I don't know. I always leave room in my epistemology for surprises and big reversals. All that's really required is radical openmindedness. Don't close down your mind even after an awakening. Keep being curious. Keep learning. Keep reading. Keep hearing other points of view. You just never know what you might discover.

But that end sits at the bottom of a very deep well, so very few people have reached it. But I could be wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Of course minor insights about life have no end. Those and science are infinite. There is an infinite amount of personal development -style insights.
</p>

<p>
	Liberation does not require learning about everything. Learning never ends, but liberation I think has some end-point. You could be liberated but still learning new stuff every day about the world. It's important to distinguish those.
</p>

<p>
	If you define liberation as totally knowledge of everything, then that seems impossible.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't spend too much time worrying about it. Learn from whoever you feel is good enough for you. Learn from multiple sources to avoid blindspots. Have at least 10 different sources that you are cross-referencing or you will get blindspots.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I cross-reference 50-100 sources to make sure I don't get trapped in a blindspot. That's how seriously I take this epistemic problem. It is no joke. You will get trapped, I can almost guarantee it.

<title>How deluded Leo is ?</title>

<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

<p>
	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/6963-legendary/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="6963" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/6963-legendary/" rel="">@legendary</a> That is very difficult to assess in practice, especially if you haven't had multiple awakenings yourself.
</p>

<p>
	The challenge is that different minds talk about awakening in different ways, so just because two people talk different and emphasize different things does not necessarily mean their level of awakening is different.
</p>

<p>
	To be totally honest, I don't know anyone else's level of awakening. I only know what levels I have experienced. The rest is my speculations.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to try to guess a person's levels of awakening by asking them various questions about the nature of reality. Depending on how they answer these questions you might catch some clues about how awake they really are. But again, you're still just guessing. You don't really know. It could just be a failure to communicate. Many awake people are just poor communicators.
</p>

<p>
	Some questions I like to ask people to determine how awake they are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Why is there something rather than nothing?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		How does God create?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is your true nature?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is non-existence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Truth?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Infinity?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Consciousness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is Love?
	</li>
	<li>
		Have you become conscious of infinite intelligence?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is the deepest thing you've become conscious of?
	</li>
	<li>
		Do other people exist?
	</li>
	<li>
		etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	If they are not able to answer these questions clearly and satisfactorily, then I consider that they are not fully awake. Although it might just be that they don't want to answer such questions. It can be hard to tell.
</p>

<p>
	To me the highest teaching must affirm: 1) You are God, 2) Total nonduality, 3) Infinity & Nothingness
</p>

<p>
	Teachings which cannot answer the question of why there is something rather than nothing are incomplete in my opinion. Because I have clearly answered this question for myself. So I know it can be done. Teachings which try to emphasize emptiness or formlessness over form are also incomplete in my opinion since they fail to fully comprehend that form and formlessness are identical. Teachings which claim there is no God are also suspect. Since you can clearly recognize that you are God. I am also suspicious of teachings which never talk about absolute Love or which deny Love as an Absolute. I am also suspicious of teachings which do not ever mention the energetic aspects of awakening. I am super suspicious of any teachings which claims that enlightenment is binary and has no degrees. To me this is clearly false as my experience says otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	If someone cannot explain clearly what God is, why God is, and how God works, they are not fully awake in my opinion. Since I have been able to understand all that for myself. It can clearly be done. And not as theory, belief, or speculation. You can be totally conscious of how God works.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can also evaluate a person's demeanor, energy, and vibe. But this can also be misleading. It can be hard to tell whether you are projecting your own ideas onto them.
</p>

<p>
	So in practice the best thing you can do is not to get married to any one teacher or teaching. Keep looking for deeper and deeper teachings and you will probably keep finding them. And also remember, just because someone isn't fully awaken doesn't mean you can't learn a lot from them. So don't get too perfectionistic trying to find the perfect teacher. The most awake people are often poor teachers. Teaching ability is not at all the same as degree of awakening. The best teachers will likely be less awake than the most awakened people: precisely because they spend a lot time teaching! In the same way that the best mathematicians are not the best math teachers.
</p>

<p>
	Whenever you are in doubt, just ask 5-MeO-DMT and it will tell you the truth -- assuming you're ready to stomach it. It will not lie to you. Your mind might lie. But 5-MeO does not. Every answer you want is there. You just have to dig it out a bit, which can take time. I will trust 5-MeO-DMT over any living master. Direct experience is king.

<p>
	Oh, yes! One can definitely have a direct consciousness of why it all exists.
</p>

<p>
	It's because something = nothing. In other words, reality cannot distinguish itself from nothing. It is being all states at once, so to speak. There is on one in reality to arbitrate between whether reality is happening or not. If you think it is happening, that's true for you. But you could also stop thinking that it's happening, and that will be true for you. Which is really true? Both and neither!
</p>

<p>
	You think there is something, but that something is not different from nothing. So it's sort of like reality never really happened. And yet it did. Paradox.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to phrase it is: infinity = zero.
</p>

<p>
	Existence has no opposite. Existence is Nothing/Zero.
</p>

<p>
	Pick an object in your room, like a chair. Look at it. Now, try to see it as though it were a hologram from Star Wars. A hologram is like an object which exists (it has an appearance of a chair) but actually it is nothing. It has no substance. It is just a hollow appearance with nothing behind it.
</p>

<p>
	Yet another way to phrase it is like this: Imagine that reality never happened at all. Imagine there was only nothing. Well, congrats! because that's precisely the case! You're sitting in this nothing right now! You are right in the middle of that nothing. You must stop thinking of nothing as formlessness. You must see that form is identical to nothing too. The duality you create between something and nothing must be erased since it never existed to being with.
</p>

<p>
	In other words: nothing looks precisely like whatever you are seeing right now. Nothing is NOT the absence of appearances. Don't fall into that trap. You must learn to see appearances as nothing. Look at a chair and see it as nothing. Look at a cat and see it as nothing. Look at a wall and see it as nothing. Look at human and see it as nothing. Look at a tree and see it as nothing.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is nothing, nowhen, nowhere, nohow. And yet appearance is there.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to phrase it is: reality has nowhere else to be but where it already is: nowhere. It's like a deleted computer file which cannot go anywhere once it's deleted but into the void. And so there it exists, in the void.
</p>

<p>
	Yet another way you can think of it is: there is no difference between actual and potential. You can think of our physical world as just a possibility within the mind of God which only exists as a possibility, not as actuality, because there is no such thing as actuality. There is only possibility. Reality cannot distinguish between possibility and actuality. That is a duality which must collapse. Conversely you could say that there is only actuality with no possibility. Either way we are saying the same thing: the collapse of those categories. What happens when all categories collapse? Nothing!
</p>

<title>Will Science ever prove Non-Duality?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/33025-will-science-ever-prove-non-duality/?do=findComment&amp;comment=392816</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/4-meditation-consciousness-enlightenment-spirituality/">Meditation, Consciousness, Enlightenment, Spirituality</a></span>

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14120-sqaad/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="14120" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/14120-sqaad/" rel="">@SQAAD</a> Science proved it 100 years ago with the radical epistemic discoveries of quantum mechanics. It just hasn't premeated mainstream culture.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that you cannot prove something to a closedminded person no matter how much proof you have. If an ego-mind wishes to believe in materialism, no amount of proof will convince it otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	The way this problem is resolved is that culture must evolve. There must be a culture war to the point where materialism is so discredited that you would look like a fool to ever speak of it publicly. In the same way that you would look like a fool to say publicly that the Earth is 5000 years old. Serious people will laugh at you. So it must become with materialism.
</p>

<p>
	It will take hundreds of years for that to happen.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point is that the ego-mind does not allow its metaphysics to be open to being disproven. It is taken as fact/reality and you cannot change facts (or so the ego-mind believes). Of course there was nothing factual about materialist metaphysics to begin with. But this is denied by the materialist.
</p>

<p>
	It's a catch-22 situation. Individuals cannot realize it because culture is backwards. And culture cannot change because individuals are backwards. So it takes a long time for progress to occur. Generations must pass. The old dogmatic folks must natrually die off.
</p>

<p>
	This is one reason why death is good. If humans lived forever they would become totally rigid and stuck in their minds. Culture could not evolve. Technology could not happen as rapidly.
</p>

It is highly selective. Yet it is still EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
	This part is paradoxical.

Max potency is not what you want. You want max clarity. I have not found anything yet with a higher clarity than 5-MeO-DMT.

<p>
	Yes, I have tried the other subtance. It was quite freaky. I would not recommend it to most people. It really warps your mind and has a high body load.

			Insights carry legitimate truths but they are stored in the frontal lobe, and merely by storing them due to their reductionist nature they distort and pervert. Are hijacked by the devil. Emotional highs, subconsious distortions are created without ones being the wiser. Look up the brahmanjala sutta. The Buddha talks about this at length in said sutta. 
		</p>

		<p>
			What is my point. If your stable level of consciousness is at one point and you jump deep into the depth of reality. The insights you carry back will be heavily perverted. Far more than you know. They will carry the stench of the devil. The ten defilements, and although they will sound good and reflect an actual reality. They will be far, far in purity. To the actuality.
		</p>

		<p>
			Ones mind needs to be trained to ingest an insight without perversion. Insights with heavy perversion can even be counterproductive. Eg there is nothing to do types in advaita.
		</p>

		<p>
			In my opinion the psychedelic path suffers heavily from this fact.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is some truth to what you are saying. Yes, it's important to be careful.
</p>

<p>
	But also you have to consider where many people would be who do psychedelics if they didn't do them. My suggestion is: in a far worse place. For example, if I had not done 5-MeO over the last 2 years, my teachings would be significantly worse and less truthful than they are now and I would never have been able to access the levels of consciousness, truth, insight, and purification through traditional meditation or self-inquiry. So what was I to do in this case?
</p>

<p>
	My point is, don't let perfection get in the way of one's growth. Most people who follow me are nowhere near capable of having 5-MeO levels of consciousness and insight sober through a few sits of meditation or self-inquiry. So what do you suggest they do? Your suggestions must be practical and workable for ordinary people. You cannot just assume that the person is spiritually gifted as it sounds like you have always been.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is not equal for all people. Some people have a much harder path than you. What is to be done with such people? Since most people are in fact like this, we cannot expect perfection from them. It's not about becoming fully awake, it's about helping them become MORE awake THAN THEY'VE BEEN.
</p>

<p>
	There is a process at work here. Yes, there are traps in the process. Every spiritual path has many traps. Psychedelics do have some unique traps. But they are also amazing and life-changing is very positive ways.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	They mostly agree that awakening = Absolute Truth = Nothing = Everything = God = Love = Consciousness
</p>

<p>
	It's just a question of how deeply you comprehend it, how much of its consequences you see, how well you embody it in everyday life, and how conscious you are of things. These vary greatly.
</p>

<p>
	There's also the issue of: how integral is your view of spirituality? For example, are you going to deny that Hindu's understand awakening? That Muslims do? That Jews do? That Buddhists do? Are you gonna pick one team and criticize all the others? Are you going to deny that people who use psychedelics have legit awakening experiences? Are you going to insist that self-inquiry is the one true way, or yoga, or Zen, or meditation? Are you going to insist that Jesus was the most awake, or Buddha, or someone else? Or are you gonna say that all awakened people are equally awake?
</p>

<p>
	There tends to be a lot of disagreement about all that mostly because the people disagreeing have not fully experienced and explored the things they're disagreeing with.
</p>

<p>
	Before you go disagreeing about 5-MeO-DMT, for example, how about you do 10 trips? Then let's talk.
</p>

<p>
	Before you go disagreeing about Islam, how about you travel to the Middle East and talk to 10 enlightened Sufi masters. Then let's talk.
</p>

<p>
	To really understand all this diversity there has to be genuine desire to understand it. You can't just cling to your POV while maintaining that everyone else is deluded.
</p>

<p>
	This understanding is not strictly-speaking enlightenment. It is a side pursuit. But in my opinion it is highly worthwhile. We are living more and more in an integrated world. We must learn to understand each other better, otherwise confusion, delusion, and evil happen.
</p>

Then again, paradox does not really exist. Paradox only exists within the realm of mind, when mind tries to articulate infinity. If you just sit and look at reality as it is without thought, there is no paradox.
</p>

<p>
	So the paradox is that there is no paradox, until you start to think about it <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	"=" has nothing to do with math. It's a way of saying two things are one.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I could say: you = me. That's not math. It's a nondual truth.
</p>

<p>
	I could say:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I = God
	</li>
	<li>
		God = Love
	</li>
	<li>
		God = Intelligence
	</li>
	<li>
		God = Nothingness
	</li>
	<li>
		God = Infinity
	</li>
	<li>
		Ego = devil
	</li>
	<li>
		Fear = illusion
	</li>
	<li>
		Nonduality = Oneness
	</li>
	<li>
		Infinity = Zero
	</li>
	<li>
		Truth = Love
	</li>
	<li>
		Form = Formlessness
	</li>
	<li>
		God = Creation
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	And these are all highly worthwhile realizations to have. You are not going to realize all these identities in one shot. This is why having multiple awakenings is so important.
</p>

<p>
	The above is actually a very elegant way of communicating the highest truths. In fact, I'll be doing a whole episode about these "equations".
</p>

<p>
	My formulations are just one way of expressing/communicating Truth. There are many other ways. Each way will be partial and emphasize different aspects of Truth/God. If you want the full Truth, then you must go beyond the words.
</p>

<p>
	The point here is: never take my words too literally. Always leave some leeway. Read between the lines. Grok the intention behind the communication.

	What you must realize is this:
</p>

<p>
	Something = Nothing
</p>

<p>
	Infinity = Zero
</p>

<p>
	Form = Formlessness
</p>

<p>
	Illusion = Reality
</p>

<p>
	This is one of the deepest awakenings you can have. You will not understand this logically. Only at the moment of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Asking if God cannot be without form assumes that form and formless are two, but they are in fact one.
</p>

<p>
	God is simultaneously without form (the Godhead) and all form which has ever occurred anywhere. It is both! It is ALL!
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate realization of nonduality is the unification of form and formlessness, so you see them as one. In this way, the everyday material world becomes nothing, like a divine hologram. Your body starts to feel light, like it is a ghost, like you are etherial.
</p>

<p>
	Etherial = ether = 5th element = nothingness = consciousness = love = God

Sure the mind can only express so much and even if your experience deepens it may translate into the same speech output. But the question is how this experienced depth translates into increased reverberation in your system and transforms you in a qualitative and long lasting way.

<p>
	This retreat was at least 10 times more profound and powerful for me. Maybe more.
</p>

<p>
	Words can't do it justice. The degrees of awakening and understanding are hard to capture in words. So to an outside observer it might all sound the same.
</p>

<p>
	"Leo, how many times can you say that you are God/nothingness/infinity? Haven't you said all this 2 years ago?" 
</p>

<p>
	Yes, but the degrees of it are lost in the communication.

<p>
	That distinction is somewhat moot.
</p>

<p>
	A Zen student strives very hard before and even after awakening. According to your logic you would say that all Zen is artificial. And by that standard all spirituality and all growth is artificial. Which is not a good view.
</p>

<p>
	Seeking to embody and to be more fully conscious of God is not artificial, it is a natural part of this whole awakening and self-transformation process. How else could it be?
</p>

<p>
	When transformation happens in you, you feel it. I am not saying that I am 100% transformed. It's not different than after any meditation retreat. You would be back, you would be somewhat transformed, but you would also still mostly be the old you. And you will have to work to embody the stuff you learned and realized during your retreat.
</p>

<p>
	Radical transformation does not happen over night. Realigning the mind is like realigning teeth with braces.
</p>

<p>
	In practice, to become fully God-realized will require some force and some contrivance. It is not going to be an effortless, purely organic process.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't it interesting how much disagreement exists between people on this issue of awakening? I want you guys to notice that. How do you explain it?
</p>

<p>
	The very fact that this much disagreement exists -- and it exists not just on this forum but across ALL spiritual schools and teachings -- is evidence that there is far more than one degree and aspect of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth is Absolute and One, but there are many degrees and facets to it and very few people have accessed all the degrees and facets. Hence the disagreements.
</p>

<p>
	If Truth/God was one-dimensional, there would be no disagreements amongst enlightened people, but there are! Take any two deeply enlightened people and you will likely find some disagreements between them in this point. Sometimes very stark disagreement.
</p>

<p>
	If you disagree with what I just said, that itself is evidence of what I am saying.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful when dismissing other people's POV as delusion
</p>

<p>
	Every great spiritual teacher I have come across acknowledges that there are degrees of awakening. Zen masters acknowledge it. Not just degrees of embodiment. Degrees of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	As God, you would realize your penis is Perfect and Good however it is.
</p>

<p>
	The desire for a bigger penis is devilry and lack of self-acceptance.
</p>

<p>
	EVERYTHING is as it should be! You only need to purify yourself enough to see the truth of this.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how you create your own hell by wanting a bigger penis. See? You are in heaven but you create a hell out of it. That is the core mistake of humans.

			The way Leo talks about the Absolute- I mean things like infinity, god, how a chair is infinite, how the 20 years old memory still existing now, how his human body is literally God's body etc and etc; don't these declarations subtly imply the existence of an independent universe with strict laws and regulations out of which nothing exist?
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It all exists as nothingness/emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	It exists sort of like a hologram in Star Wars. Here it is, but its substance is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	What I was describing was how the infinite hologram works.
</p>

<p>
	The illusion does exist. Otherwise you wouldn't see, hear, or feel anything. Form exists. It's just that form and formlessness are one. And form is always changing from the human POV while formlessness does not change.

<p>
	Hmmm... so it sounds like the main issue is that it doesn't dissolve as well. That's somewhat of a shame. HCl dissolves within seconds very easily, just like table salt or sugar would.
</p>

<p>
	That might affect the plugging method. Although I would think it should still work.
</p>

<p>
	The plugging method requires that your bowls be empty. Very important. And you want to plug it not too deep, but also not too shallow. It takes some practice but I perfected my technique such that it works consistently almost every time.
</p>

<p>
	20mg of HCl is enough for a breakthrough for me. Although that will be too little for most people. I have seen people take 20mg of HCl without anything close to a breakthrough like I get on exactly the same dose and substance. So individual variablity is a real issue.
</p>

<p>
	Anyhow, thanks for sharing.
</p>

<p>
	I wonder if there is an easy method of converting Oxalate to HCl?
</p>

<p>
	I haven't found it any harder than integrating insights from a 10 day Vipassana retreat.
</p>

<p>
	Integration is core to all spiritual practice. Do not assume you will just awaken and become an angel without a TON of integration work.
</p>

<p>
	There is more work in integration than there is in having the awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Try doing 30 days of Vipassana and then go spend a week living with your mother and see how that goes. See if you can keep your Vipassana insights while living with your mother.
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to keep your Vipassana insights when you meditate for 8 hours a day in a cave non-stop while someone else prepares your food for you. It's much harder when you have to run a business, raise a family, attract a mate, cook your own food, do your own taxes, etc.

You are judging is improperly when you judged it like so: If it fully enlightens me in one go, then it's good. If it doesn't, then it's bad and useless.
</p>

<p>
	If you're gonna use that criterion, then you should apply it equally to meditation. Like so: if I sit down and meditate for 30 minutes and it fully enlightens me, then I will do it and it's good. But if doesn't, then it's bad and I'm never going to meditate again.
</p>

<p>
	How many meditation sits does it take to become stably awakened? 1000? 5000? 10,000?
</p>

<p>
	Now apply those numbers to psychedelics. So your comparison is fair.
</p>

<p>
	What would happen if you did 1000 trips? Would you become stably awake? If so, you'd beat mediation by 10x.
</p>

<p>
	Why do I have a deeper understanding of metaphysical reality than Shinzen Young, who has 40 years of professional practice while I have less than 5 years of amateur practice? How do you explain that? There's some facts and statistics for ya.
</p>

<p>
	You see, there's more to this than just awakening. You must look at psychedelics as a holistic tool for self-awareness, personal development, and mental health.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to say. You can only know by doing both and seeing which one gets you higher.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is gonna be hard to beat. You could only beat it if you devoted your entire life to full-time practice. You basically would have no life but meditation.
</p>

<p>
	The real answer is to do both. They complement each other perfectly. Nothing I realize on 5-MeO-DMT really contradicts what the most advanced yogis say. The alignment is uncanny.
</p>

<p>
	If 5-MeO somehow revealed truths which were the opposite of what the most advanced yogis say, then we would have a serious problem, as you would not know which to trust. But if they are 90% aligned, then there's no problem.

			Is it not possible that by doing consciousness practices for years and years, one actually creates a process for becoming more conscious which exponentially increases consciousness so that it seems like, for someone who has not practice long enough, it would be impossible to reach consciousness levels as high as one does with psychedelics?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course, that's exactly what it takes, decades of industrial-grade practice which virtually no one is ready to do.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that most people are not full-time yogis. So what good is it to tell people: become a full-time yogi, otherwise you will not understand anything I teach?
</p>

<p>
	What we need are efficient ways of communicating these powerful insights. 10 to 20 years of practice is not within the realm of reality for most people. So we need something more effective. Someone who is going to do these practices hardcore for 20 years is already fully-bought in. You are preaching to the choir when teaching him. The real issue is, how do you teach to new people? People who are not part of the choir.
</p>

<p>
	That's where psychedelics come in.
</p>

<p>
	And also don't forget, there are many Zen masters and teachers who still have never accessed levels of consciousness as high as 5-MeO-DMT can deliver within 15 minutes. So 20 years of practice is no guarantee whatsoever that you will beat out 5-MeO-DMT. Can someone like Sadhguru beat out 5-MeO? Probably, but that's totally irrelevant because that helps no one. That is like saying that Arnold can lift 500 pounds. Yes, he can, but your sister can't. She needs to use a forklift.
</p>

<p>
	The point of technology is to make things which almost no one can do accessible to everyone easily.
</p>

<p>
	Could you imagine how backwards it would be if everyone had to be computer programmer in order to use a computer or smart phone? Or a pilot in order to use an airplane? Think about it.
</p>

<p>
	Think about how backwards it is that a person must spend 20 years of his life chasing an enlightenment experience.
</p>

So it's not about not being excited, it's about realizing that excitement is happening within the emptiness that is your true nature. Trying to achieve some monotone state is not the goal, nor will you ever succeed in that. You can have emotional ups and downs while being conscious and detached from them.
</p>

<p>
	Emotional range is good and healthy. Don't try to be monotone. Laugh & cry.

<title>Emotional Problems Sub-Forum</title>

<p>
	Also understand that a significant percentage of the general population has serious emotional issues to work through. So banning such talk is not going to eliminate the problem. It will only make it worse. At least here people can vent and get some decent pointers/resources. By eliminating this sub-forum people would have to keep all that pent up inside them with no one to talk to. And of course it would inevitably spill over into the other sub-forums.
</p>

<p>
	It's not self-actualization or this forum which is causing these serious emotional problems. They are pre-existing conditions. A psychologically healthy person is not going to come to this forum and leave sick or suicidal. So don't blame the existence of this forum for these issues. This is just a place for people to express themselves. Expect to see a lot of ego expressed here.
</p>

<p>
	I have noticed that when someone here is truly feeling suicidal, people on this forum try to do what they can to help them. But even so, some people are in such bad shape psychologically that forum talk is not going to heal them. How else could it be? With thousands of people visiting this forum, we are gonna some really dysfunctional cases which might even be beyond help (at least help via online).
</p>

</p>

<p>
	 
</p>

<p>
	Like I have said to the devils that lurk here, don't think for a minute that I don't see through your games.
</p>

<p>
	As far as seriously suicidal people, those we should treat with compassion and try to help them, but only if they ask for our help. If a person does not want any help (even if they are suicidal) then that is their choice and we are not to impose our will and our desires on them. Keep in mind that people have a right to commit suicide and you should not judge them for it if that is what they really want.
</p>

<p>
	If a person truly wants help with a serious emotional issue, they will ask for help. And they will receive it.
</p>

<p>
	But keep in mind that the ego-mind loves to use threats of suicide to play games, get sympathy, get attention, etc. So do take such threats with a grain of salt. If someone really wanted to commit suicide they would just do it. They would not brag about it on a forum, trying to fish for attention -- that is all ego.

Just because something works for you doesn't mean it will work for everyone. So stay humble with your advice. Health issues can be very complex, multi-factorial, and personal.

<p>
	Do not stick your nose in other people's health issues as if you know them.
</p>

<p>
	The point of the money is to afford the medical treatments (which tend to be expensive). If <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/9989-fountainbleu/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="9989" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/9989-fountainbleu/" rel="">@Fountainbleu</a> didn't have a money shortage, then this situation would be much easier to handle. Not everyone can just take months off from work to heal. That is a luxury which assumes you've got money to burn through.
</p>

<p>
	Generally-speaking I am very against anti-depressants. But if there is no other way, then you must do what you must do to survive.

	It has.

</p>

<p>
	It's not just patterns and survival. I'm talking about understanding the metaphysical structure of reality and why it is the way it is. There is no accident or randomness to it. It has a Logos.

Are you saying that all of these social anxiety issues started after your car crash?? You didn't have them before?
</p>

<p>
	Brain trauma is a serious thing and requires serious treatment, not merely spiritual techniques. There are supplements and various EEG brain training methods which might help you a lot. Research neurofeedback brain training.
</p>

<p>
	You can also contact the Dr Amen brain clinic in California. I know they do great work when it comes to assessing and healing brain injury. Or find another similar provider.
</p>

<p>
	I would focus on doing whatever it takes to heal your brain injury because you are gonna have to live with it for life and it will seriously affect your earning potential.
</p>

<p>
	If you need to take some meds to start a biz to earn the money to heal your brain, that is a good plan if you cannot afford to heal yourself immediately.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a link to Dr Amen's clinic:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.amenclinics.com" rel="external nofollow">https://www.amenclinics.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	You should also do research into brain injury recovery. Many books have been written on the subject. Educate yourself on the best ways to heal.

<p>
	Things are not just as they are. They are a very specific way, a very deliberate and intelligent way. Everything is intelligible. It is possible to become conscious of why every hair on your arm exists exactly as it does and not otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to understand why the whole universe exists. Profound awakening required of course. This is no ordinary reason. You must penetrate the very structure of God. It has a logic to it.

<p>
	There is nothing wrong with Zen teachings per se, I was just saying that they are minimalist. Minimalism does not make people aware of what they are missing.
</p>

<p>
	How many Zen students really understand the depth of Zen? Virtually none. It requires super-human levels of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha said: no one will understand. And so it is. It's too much.

<title>Using the force of God as an excuse to have sex your son's wife?</title>

It plays coy.
</p>

<p>
	Virtually no one who practices Zen understands how deep consciousness goes or what God is. Only a few of the highest Zen masters do.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Shinzen Young does not understand why reality exists. He's not fully woke and he does not know it. That's with 40 years of professional Zen practice.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, nothing at all against his teachings. I'm just saying there are levels which virtually no one has accessed. I am just using this example to point out how tricky this work is. No one is safe. Proceed with extreme care.

<p>
	No they aren't.
</p>

<p>
	They are just less corrupted by beliefs and less rigid.
</p>

<p>
	Kids are very selfish and nowhere close to woke. They are like animals. They have no clue they are God.

In it's disguise as the devil God does all sorts of evils. In its pure undisguised from God is pure love and goodness. For God to hate it must incarnate itself as an ego and delude itself into believing it is not God. So when God forgets who it is, it does evil. When God is forced to play the game of survival, it does evil in order to survive.

</blockquote>

<p>
	If you mean Absolute Truth then your contemplations should eventually converge. But even so, there are many facets to Absolute Truth such that even the same person will not reach the same point twice in a row, never mind other people. The trick is that the Absolute is singular, but it can be seen in various light, so to speak, and it will be interpreted very differently by different minds. It's sort of like looking at an object with very little light in the room. The object itself is always the same, but the lighting conditions plus your perspective on that object plus your distance from that object determine what you will see. Someone from 100ft away at night will see something very different than someone 2 inches away in full daylight. And then there's your reactions, opinions, feelings, and judgments about the object. All of that makes it very unlikely that two people understand/see anything the same way, even the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, there should be some rough broad consensus.
</p>

<p>
	As far as relative truths are concerned, the situation there is even worse. The mind will color everything in such a way that your understanding of relative truths will tend to be very different from other people. Because how you see the world is a direct reflection of how you must see it in order to survive. Survival distorts perception enormously. What you see, what you know, and how you understand things is almost totally dominated by your survival needs. Truth is hardly anything your mind cares about. Your mind is 99.9% preoccupied with survival. Which is why there is so much disagreement between people.
</p>

To fully grasp what consciousness is so astounding that it ends you entire old way of life.
</p>

<p>
	When you ask What is consciousness? you are really asking What is the substance of all of existence? That's a monster of a question. It may take you 10-20 years of work to get the answer.
</p>

<p>
	I have a video: What Is Consciousness? Maybe check that out.
</p>

<p>
	In short: consciousness is nothing, consciousness is everything, consciousness is God. But just hearing that as words does very little for you. You must undertake a journey to personally realize what consciousness is. This requires multiple deep enlightenment experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Very simply, to ground your inquiry, pull out your hand right now and hold it close to your face. Look at it closely. Your hand is consciousness. Realize that. And then begin to wonder: What is consciousness? What is it's very essence? Here it is, but WHAT is it?
</p>

<p>
	HINT: Any object you look at is consciousness. There is nothing but consciousness. Consciousness is not a thing, it is a sort of ever-present, self-aware, space.
</p>

<p>
	VERY IMPORTANT: Stop thinking of consciousness is a secretion of the brain or somehow arising out of matter. The brain and matter are both made out of consciousness. Consciousness is prior to physics or physical reality. It is impossible to understand consciousness from within the materialist paradigm.
</p>

I am currently making myself familiar with Ken Wilber's model of cognitive/consciousness development/evolution.
		</p>

		<p>
			When making statements like "Things only happen by God's will." are we not running into the risk of confusing and deluding people due to the stark difference in interpretation between gross, casual, subtle and non-dual state of consciousness, and also due to a difference in cognition from different cognitive stages? 
		</p>

		<p>
			It seems to me like a person only capable of, for example, formal operational thought is actually incapable of correctly interpreting your statement, due to the inherent limitations of his cognition. Statements coming from vision logic or beyond will actually cease to be the same statements when viewed from formal operational cognition. When they read it and they are at that stage, and they agree with you, they are actually wrong about what they agree with you about. And if they do not agree, they are wrong too because they do not even comprehend the true meaning of the statement. Either way they will come out confused, whether they believe you or not.
		</p>

		<p>
			And to me this is a real problem in the spiritual community, especially with non-dual "truths" that are being thrown around like candy, necessarily misinterpreted by those who hear them, as they themselves cannot truly understand the meaning of those truths if they have not reached any non-dual states.
		</p>

		<p>
			In this forum alone I see countless of people who are adopting non-dual, casual, subtle or psychic intellectual positions without having even experienced these states. And furthermore it seems like these statements only make sense while being in the particular state they originated from, which further complicates everything as it can easily lead to self-delusion by the person who has temporarily experienced one of these states.
		</p>

		<p>
			What do we do about this problem? I know your style is not conducive to the zen-master riddle approach, but are you not worried about leading people on the wrong path if you give them higher truths that they are bound to be deluded and misinterpreted? Wouldn't a spiral wizard be a little more sophisticated, by for example luring a person to the next stage instead of going full non-dual on them if they are far removed from that realm?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, that's basically right. Higher truths/wisdom requires a certain wisdom to understand and interpret properly. Ignorant devils will misinterpret the hell out of all the highest teachings because that's what devils do. Devils turn truth into falsehood. That's the entire function of a devil.
</p>

<p>
	We are sort of damned if we do, and damned if we don't. If we don't talk about God, we are not being honest and people are being mislead. If we do talk about God, we are creating representations of God, all of which are not the actual thing, and people will be mislead. That's the tragedy of our collective situation.
</p>

<p>
	When I speak of God's will, I speak from direct experience. Of course most people have no experience of what God or God's will mean. And any ideas you have about it are wrong. So what are we to do? Direct experience is required to understand the highest teachings.
</p>

<p>
	One of the reasons I'm big on psychedelics is that they give ordinary people such direct experiences very quickly, without decades of grueling practice. So then they can understand me a lot better. You can take a psychedelic and ask it the question, "What is God's will?" or "What is God?" and it will show you the answer very clearly, as long as you are truly open to it and willing to surrender yourself and your beliefs. It might take you a few trips, but you'll get it.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, talking about God to uninformed people is very misleading to them. Because their ideas of God are so confused and backwards. You can really only talk about God to people who have experienced that they are God. Which sort of defeats the point of talking at all. And yet without talking about God how are people gonna find God? Only by accident. Which is not a good solution.
</p>

<p>
	The world of form is infinite in all directions. You can study it forever and you will be no closer to the end than when you began.
</p>

<p>
	But as far as understanding the Absolute, you can make some really headway there. You can grasp the nature of reality in one shot, although there are many facets and degrees of depth to it. So even there you can spend a lot of time understanding it deeper and deeper.

<p>
	Sometimes you grow out of your passion onto something new. And sometimes you just need to rekindle your passion because you are doing it too mechanically, too much for external rather than internal reasons.
</p>

<p>
	Taking time to contemplate your life in solititude helps enormously to figure what the problem is.

<p>
	Try not to make a big spectacle of it. Then it won't be so dramatic and scary. With spiritual death you discover that you've jumped off a cliff only to land on the fluffiest feather mattress, so you're not really losing anything. Don't let the ego create a big story about how it's losing so much. You're mostly losing bullshit delusions and gaining peace and authenticity. So it's a good trade.
</p>

<p>
	I've made the mistake in the past of over-dramatizing the ego-death part. Yes it happens but facing death is also not as hard or bad as it sounds. After a couple dozen ego-deaths it becomes natural and not a big deal.
</p>

In fact, Absolute Truth is all there ever is. That's what truth is: that which is the case. It's actually very simple: whatever is must be true. And that which is untrue does not exist at all.
</p>

<p>
	The being of this very moment is none other than Absolute Truth, but you are not yet conscious enough to see it as such. Concepts are getting in the way of direct consciousness of being.
</p>

<p>
	Once you find the Absolute Truth you will discover that it is so grand, astounding, epic, and good that it will kill you.

</p>

<p>
	Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	But this will take you some years of hard work to fully realize. So get to work. It's worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe everything I said above is false? You don't know. This requires exploration.

</p>

<p>
	You could eat some magic mushrooms and know things which would otherwise be impossible for a human to know. That would be another way.
</p>

<p>
	You don't even know if Kriya yoga will work. Maybe it's a scam as far as you know. See how tricky knowledge is? What do you trust? What is true?
</p>

<p>
	Truth is a highly non-trivial matter. How do you even know what criterion you'll use to determine if a thing is true? What if your criterion is false?
</p>

<p>
	And yet at the same time you also cannot say that all knowledge is false or impossible since that itself would be true knowledge, and you don't actually know that for sure. Such a claim would require that you test every piece of knowledge in the universe to make sure they are all false. You are nowhere close to doing that.
</p>

<p>
	So the bottom line is: keep a very open mind, don't dismiss anything, and run some experiments. Kriya yoga is one such experiment out of hundreds that you will have to run in order to come to know what knowledge is and is not.
</p>

Although violence and disturbance is also an aspect of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There is no "best" really. It depends on your goals. Some people love their suffering and fantasies. Very few people are really ready and willing to awaken from Maya.
</p>

<p>
	Harmony is a tricky thing. Being a total pacificist for example when all your neighbors are wolves will not lead to harmony but your extinction or enslavement.
</p>

<p>
	Violence and peace are both necessary, which is why they co-exist. Violence begets peace, and peace begets violence. It's dialectical.

This kind of thinking is itself delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Be nuanced. Not all beliefs and teachings are wrong or false. You must evaluate them within a certain limited relative context. Stop trying to make everything be absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Teachings have certain pragmatic purposes and also limits. Teachings are partial relative truths. How else could it be?

<p>
	It is not cut in actually, it is cut as an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	If an actor on stage got so wrapped up in playing his character that he forgot for a moment that he was just acting, that's how ignorance comes about.
</p>

<p>
	It is the nature of consciousness to be very hypnotic. It hypnotizes itself into dreamlike states which it then cannot resist.
</p>

<p>
	Ever play a video game and get so immersed in the world that you forget about the "real" world? Well, that's precisely how consciousness works. Appearance becomes reality. For a while. Always only for a while.
</p>

<p>
	Ever jerk off to porn? What is that? You are literally jerking off to an LCD screen! There's your illusion.

I have been studying this question for over 15 years. I have literally poured thousands of hours contemplating this one question because it is so important. On it hinges everything else. If you get this question wrong, you're basically fucked in life.
</p>

<p>
	From your current POV the truth is you don't know what can or cannot be known. You do not even know what knowing is!
</p>

<p>
	This is a great place to start. From this place you can do some serious inquiry. This question is not to be guessed or answered by looking up an answer in a book. You must really go on a journey and explore what knowledge is and how it works.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind that there are different kinds of knowing. Verbal or rational knowing is only one kind. The most advanced things I speak of are knowable, but not from your current state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	For example, it is possible to know what God is or why existence exists or what consciousness is. But not through coventional logical verbal knowledge. There is knowing and understanding beyond the human mind.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest insights I share are not just stories or beliefs -- they are transrational understandings.
</p>

<p>
	Consider that there is a very profound connection between knowing and being. Some things can only be known by being them. This is the domain of mysticism and samadhi.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Knowledge as a relative thing is good and legit.
</p>

<p>
	Understanding is real and not to be trashed. Without understanding you could not even understand this sentence or awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Be more nuanced. The Absolute and understanding and knowledge can all co-exist. Each has its proper place and role to play. The mistake is to confuse them. The mistake is to not realize their limits. Knowledge simply has limits.

You must exhaust the mind's answers. Purge them. It would be very helpful for you to write down all your theories about what you are, no matter how ridiculous, just to purge them. Write them out, then cross them out and throw them in the trash.
</p>

<p>
	Not knowing is exactly the place you want to get to. The problem is that you still have many ideas and theories about what you are. You haven't purged enough yet to truly not know.
</p>

<p>
	The mind will never grasp it. It must be silenced through this purging method. Then just sit and bask in the silence, and that will be your best chance of enlightenment. It will not happen via your mind. The mind is the only obstacle to enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	A LOT of purging must happen. Way more than you'll be comfortable with. You must even purge things like your childhood memories of yourself, since they are not the True Self.

<p>
	Since God is Absolute Truth, even a hint of lying, dishonesty, falsehood, or inathenticity automatically severes your connection to God. That is okay. It is not "bad" to be seperated from God, but it painful since you become lost in your own falsehood. That is the definition of devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Lying is only "bad" relative to if you want to be happy. If you are okay with being unhappy, then lie a lot. If you want to be happy, lie as little as possible. If you want to realize God, lie as little as possible.
</p>

<p>
	There is only one reason you lie: fear. If you were immortal, untouchable, and fearless you would never lie. In other words if you were God, you'd never lie. Really think about that. That's deep.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute ethics is Truth/Love. It is Goodness without an opposite. It is God.

It will be unique for each person, and it will even change for the same person over time.
</p>

<p>
	You must experiment and see what works best for you.
</p>

<p>
	You can certainly maintain a 1hr daily meditation practice or Kriya yoga practice while you do pickup or dating. That's the minimum I'd recommend.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking you should set an overarching goal/plan for your year. What is the biggest thing you'll be focusing on this year? Attraction? Enlightenment? Business? Improving self esteem? Better nutrition? etc.
</p>

<p>
	Don't try to do it all at once. Space things out. You'll be amazed how much stuff you can do in 5-10 years if you focus.
</p>

<title>What Does It Mean To Question Existence Itself?</title>

<p>
	That's a belief you should question.
</p>

<p>
	It seems nothing will change, but the whole point of this work is that appearances are very deceptive.
</p>

<p>
	Basically, just take a psychedelic. Otherwise you will waste 10 years and still not realize what you're missing. I am not kidding about psychedelics. They will change your life forever. There is no more powerful tool for understanding reality.
</p>

<p>
	You absolutely need to hit entirely new states of consciousness to understand the power and depth of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Let go of what you've been told and sit with an empty mind. You must enter a deep state of not-knowing. The simple truth is, you do not know what you are.
</p>

<p>
	Make a clear distinction between talking about, reading about, listening to, or thinking about what you are, versus actually sitting and silently observing what you are. These are totally different activities.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: What Is Actuality? to help ground yourself in the actual work.
</p>

<p>
	Or, just take a psychedelic.

	I don't know where you found that nonsense. That is not what I consider proper pickup. Why are you even looking at that when there is so much good material out there?

<p>
	Pickup theory does not apply to women trying to find men. Women need a whole different set of advice and techniques. You can find tons of material specifically tailored to women. Dating advice for women. It is not going to involve cold approaching men on the street asking for phone numbers.

Really, really, really advanced stuff! It took me tens of years of earthly development before I got to the lofty topics I'm now covering. There are many earthly materialistic development topics which I hardly cover at all even though they are very important for the average viewer.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like I'm teaching a college calculus class but you walk in by accident as a 5th grader. You need to handle the basics first.
</p>

<p>
	What most of you guys need is some basic Tony Robbins shit. Do some of that before you try to get all spiritual. Be mindful of getting ahead of your skiis.

<p>
	I'm not sure what this means.
</p>

<p>
	The finite can know the infinite. And the infinite can know the finite. The infinite is not other than the finite.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand spiritual phrasing in their proper contexts.
</p>

<p>
	What Spria might be talking about is the the Absolute formless Godhead which you can think of as sort of disconnected from the formed realm. You could say that it does not know the finite formed realm. But at the same it is also identical with the finite formed realm.
</p>

<p>
	In this context, you have to understand that the word "know" is virtually identical with "be". We are not talking about linguistic knowledge. We are talking about being.
</p>

<p>
	But all of this talk will only confuse you more. You must let all this go and just do the practices. Take a psychedelic to easily see what Spira is pointing to.
</p>

	It's not the weed, it's one's existential questioning that does the work. The weed is just a lubricant. A lubricant does not do the work by itself, it needs a running engine.
</p>

<p>
	Which explains why most people who smoke weed never realize God. Because their engine isn't running to begin with. They are not existentially questioning reality.

	The whole point of enlightenment is to reach your Absolute Nature and to be sure about it.

<p>
	If you feel like you can die, you're not there yet. Keep going until you're 100% sure you're immortal.

<title>Can low self-esteem make you selfish?</title>

<p>
	Low self esteem people tend to be very insecure, helpless, and needy. They love to play victim.
</p>

<p>
	When you are incapable of meeting your basic needs your entire life becomes dysfunctional and backwards. You are forced to resort to outrageous degrees of selfishness just to maintain your basic existence.

			There's always more to learn and more to be conscious of for the hippocampus. But "enlightenment" is before all that. You already are it all, there's no need to huff and puff to try to reach for something other just seeing that you are the one reaching. I mean look. It would be fun to know but there's nothing that will fill up the illusionary empty hole you keep thinking up when pretending you're somethin else than that which you are..!

<p>
	You misunderstood what I asked you. I was not talking about learning more stuff for the hippocampus. I was talking about being conscious of things which you're still not conscious of.
</p>

<p>
	A little bit of enlightenment is a dangerous thing indeed. Makes for a flippant smartass.
