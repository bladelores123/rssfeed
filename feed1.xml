	But I've been to a Sadhguru event and his members are total sheep. They are just zombies. They don't think about spirituality for themselves at all and they worship him. It's pretty stupid. After he's dead it's gonna turn into just another religion/cult.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru does not teach his people to think critically, he just teaches them dogmatic techniques which they perform like monkeys.

	Why are you talking a substance if you don't trust what it is?
</p>

<p>
	You took 35mg of 5-MeO-DMT? And you are surprised it didn't feel good? At 35mg you're lucky you're not dead.

<title>Understanding Relativism and the Validity of All Perspectives</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/66464-understanding-relativism-and-the-validity-of-all-perspectives/?do=findComment&amp;comment=910030</link>

<p>
	In the Absolute sense, nothing is higher or lower. But in a relative sense, things are higher and lower.
</p>

<p>
	Relative to survival and your personal well-being, you don't want to be QAnnon supporter. Being a QAnnon supporter is a problem relative to the QAnnon supporter's own worldview, because a QAnnon supporter's worldview holds that certain things are true and certain things are false. And one day the QAnnon supporter will discover that QAnnon violate his own standards of truth. It is not Leo who says QAnnon is false. It will the QAnnon supporter himself who will realize QAnnon is false. So the problem with QAnnon is that it is incoherent by its own standards -- it's just that the QAnnon fanatic hasn't realized it yet. When he realizes it, he will be in pain.
</p>

<p>
	Any perspective which is selfish, unconscious, hateful, and fear-based will ultimately be incoherent by its own standards.
</p>

<p>
	The only perspectives which are coherent are conscious, selfless, and loving ones.
</p>

<p>
	Now you could argue: "But what's wrong with having an incoherent perspective? It's that okay?" To which the answer is: it's okay so long as you're okay with the suffering that incoherence results in. If you are okay with anything no matter what, then there is literally nothing wrong with anything. But then you're also awake. So the problem is that you are definitely not okay with anything on matter what. You are triggered so easily.
</p>

<p>
	The perspective that you have two ass holes is not equally valid to the perspective that you have one ass hole. Because eventually you will have confront the reality that you only have one ass hole. So it does matter how truthful your perspective is. The less truthful your perspectives are, the more you will struggle and suffer. But if you are okay with massive struggle and suffering, then there is no problem.
</p>

<p>
	What you need to realize is that it is you yourself who is judging the results of your own perspectives. If you didn't judge your results, there would be no problems. But you judge your results very much, hence you literally create your own problems. A wrong perspective is not wrong because others say so. It is wrong by your own standards!
</p>

<p>
	For example, you might adopt the perspective that rape is good. But then when someone rapes your mother you will realize: rape is horrible. And thus you yourself will violate and condemn your own perspective. You will realize that your perspective was selfish and foolish. In this way you evolve. It is your own internal contradictions that lead to your ruin.
</p>

<p>
	It is not necessarily ego.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds to me like he is extremely strict and demands his students obey his extreme spiritual practices. And then to support those extreme practices he needs money of course. This is not necessarily ego, it could just be his very high standards for how to do spiritual work. Obviously has some extreme ideas about society collapsing and so forth. If you honestly believed that society will collapse into nuclear war within the next 10 years, you would probably behave as he does. Although he's fooling himself if he thinks he'll be able to survive nuclear war in Costa Rica. His ashram only survives thanks to money pouring in from the outside world.
</p>

<p>
	He's basically running a monastery over there. Monasteries are radical and extreme places. I can see why he would not put up with shit from normies. A Zen monastery will also be very strict and extreme. These kinds of places are only suitable for extreme, hardcore spiritual seekers. I think the problem is that his students don't realize what they got themselves into when joining. Living in an ashram is not suitable for 99% of people.

<p>
	Sounds to me like if you socialized a lot you could change many of those weak parts of yourself.
</p>

<p>
	This is what you need, not psychedelics:

<p>

<p>
	Jokes and stories must be delivered with proper body language, state, energy, contextual awareness, etc.

<p>
	The words you say matter less then how you say them. Just parroting my story will not help you. You need to invent your own stories that fit your style.

	Reality is Absolute Perfection when you look at with a high enough degree of consciousness, free from all of your biases and attachments.

<p>
	Not necessarily. There will not be any simple formulas for this kind of thing. People simply have very different personalities and minds. The complexity of variables is staggering.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Awakening will make your innate character and personality stand out more. You will be more "you" than ever. You will be more authentic and unique as a character.
</p>

<p>
	For example, as I had awakenings I noticed they actually made me less nicer and less outwardly cheery because I realized those were masks I wore for much of my life so that people like me. So I actually became more authentically me, but at the cost of people perhaps liking me less because I no longer wear the masks they want.
</p>

<p>
	You stop giving a fuck about pleasing other humans. Of course some humans will not like this, because they like to be pleased.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is, just be true to yourself and let the chips fall where they will.

	I was subtly alluding to there being something higher than your kunadilini awakening.

<p>
	But I will not try to prove it you.

<p>
	Because it is necessary. You just lack the consciousness and intelligence to see the necessity of children dying.
</p>

<p>
	Everything that exists is absolutely necessary and could not be otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is Absolute Perfection. The only problem is that your vision is clouded.

<p>
	Don't even take my word.

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">

<p>
	Of course, but that's AFTER you deal with horror of it.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I love it! But if you're worried about solipsism being true, you probably won't love it so much.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			I'd like to know one thing, though - and this may be the most important question, after all - and it is specific to you - after such a realization dawns upon you, what gives you the eagerness and the capacity to Love 'another' in the relative sense?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't necessarily love anyone any more in the the relative human sense. My love is very metaphysical and detached. Most people would not even consider it love.
</p>

<p>
	It's very subtle. It's a deep inner love for reality itself, not towards any particular person or thing. Imagine if you will that you just fell in love with the idea of reality itself.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			To 'exist' in everyday life needs a strong foundation on the tasks of a dual nature, too - is it that you have removed the egoic desires that come with it?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Be careful what you assume about me. I have not removed all my ego or its desires. Still plenty of that left.
</p>

<p>
	I have never made any promises or pretenses about "removing all my ego / desires". You guys often fall into the trap of assuming this about me, and it's very misleading. You will be disappointed.
</p>

<p>
	The only different between me and you is that I understand what reality is. You don't. That's all. This understanding does not make me some magical special extra-good person. You will find plenty of humans who don't know anything about reality and yet are nicer and kinder that I am. I am a bit of a jerk, actually. I am not too empathetic and I don't care very much about people's personal feelings. Mostly all I care about is understanding reality. You may find this difficult to relate to.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

		<p>
			I'd like to know how you, specifically, look at the world after such a groundbreaking realization, yet in a manner that that takes into account all the subtle distinctions with regards to people, groups, institutions, politics, identities etc.?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	How can it be explained? In many ways I look at the world just as you do. The only difference is that I understand what God is. You do not.
</p>

<p>
	Again, it's a very subtle shift in perception. Nothing crazy.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			How to do you incorporate the Oneness and the infinite distinctions? I'd like to know the answer from a practical, everyday life point of view. Yes, because you have understood that form = formlessness, but how does it manifest in your everyday life - given the limits of consciousness that have been placed upon you as a human?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Who says it needs to manifest in any way at all?
</p>

<p>
	Truth is Truth. Truth is not there to be used by you for anything. You just enjoy it. Maybe it helps you not take life too seriously.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			When you meet 'another' - what goes around in your head? How do you perceive them?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Mostly no different than before. I just also know in the back of my mind that they are projections of my own mind.
</p>

<p>
	Most of my interactions with humans are transactional. I am not kissing the mail man when he drops off my mail. In fact, I don't even know his name.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

		<p>
			How has this realization of Oneness impacted the way you co-habit the world with other beings - in the relative sense, of course? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Mostly I avoid humans. I'm not running around hugging everyone. I keep to myself and try to enjoy my life and work on my life purpose. I am not an extroverted person or a social person. Now, of course, I can still socialize if I choose to. But I have little desire to do so. You may be different. People have different personalities.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			If it might not be too much of a stretch - could magic / miracles / occult be an example of this? The merging and play of forms with formlessness?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It could, but your ideas of awakening are too fantastical. Mostly nothing happens. You have some awakening and then go about taking out the trash. It's not like fireworks are shooting out of my dick every day.
</p>

<p>
	This is some good stuff! Thanks for sharing.
</p>

<p>
	Although I should add, I see plenty of egoic projection in some of these critiques. Students often become disgruntled for whatever personal reasons and need someone to blame and they are too ignorant to understand the position of a deeply mystical and God-realized person.
</p>

<p>
	My biggest critique of Sat Yoga is that I doubt there is a single person there who is woke other than Shunya. As you become his little sheep servant monkey -- you won't have the time to awaken. You'll be too busy pulling weeds from his garden.
</p>

<p>
	The way I evaluate the quality of an ashram is based on how much time they actually give you to meditate. If you only have 2 hours per day to meditate, that's a shitty ashram. If you get 10 hours per day to meditate, that's a great ashram. Before joining any community make sure you are not just being used as a source of cheap manual labor.
</p>

<p>
	Also, the large sums of money they demand, if true, is a huge red flag. That's one of the reddest flags of a proper cult. You should not be paying any spiritual guru tens of thousands of dollars.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's technically correct. However, you do not have enough time in your life to embody everything. You can only embody a tiny amount of what you can understand.
</p>

<p>
	And it is not desirable to embody Hitler. But you can still understand him within reason without embodiment.
</p>

<p>
	Embodiment will always be a subset of understanding.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to punch yourself in the face to understand that doing so is not a good idea.

Because you experienced it? How do you know that direct experience leads to the truth? I am of the opinion that truth and understanding are just two more concepts that you will eventually have to deconstruct. Of course deconstruction itself must also be deconstructed.

</blockquote>

<p>
	When you finish deconstructing deconstruction, you will realize that consciousness is Infinite Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	You think you can escape consciousness somehow, but you can't because consciousness is all there could ever be.
</p>

<p>
	You won't understand how I know this until you awaken. Until then you will be under the illusion that something outside of consciousness can exist.
</p>

<p>
	What I am telling you is not a theory or a speculation. It is 100% certain. This is the whole point and promise of awakening. It is 100% certain. No doubt is possible.

<p>
	If you keep going down this road of misunderstanding you will be asked to leave the forum. You are misunderstanding a lot of stuff.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	When I was there I definitely got strong group-think vibes. They worship Shunya way too much. But nothing I saw was a cult. But then again, my exposure to them was only 1 week long.
</p>

<p>
	All of Shunya's behaviors that I observed were of very high integrity. And he clearly knows this shit. My biggest gripe with him was his constant apocalyptic talk. Everything is framed as mainstream society is about to collapse any day, and this ashram is the only island of salvation.
</p>

<p>
	The people I met there were very nice, but they felt like sheep, not deep critical thinkers.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, Sat Yoga is basically a monastery. So you have to set your expectations appropriately. Monasteries are hardcore and conformist places.
</p>

<p>
	Practical is just selfishness. Of course there are many people how have practical morality. The point of all morality is to be practical and to serve one's survival. But this doesn't make it true. It is a fiction.

<p>
	No two people in the world have the exact same morality. Which clearly tells you that morality is relative.
</p>

<p>
	Moral systems around the world and across time vary enormously.
</p>

<p>
	There are many commonalities because humans tends to have similar survival needs. Since morality is pure selfishness, people tend to be selfish in similar ways.

<p>
	The core problem here is that you fundamentally don't understand relativity. Contemplate what relativity is.

When you do, it will feel extremely solipsistic to you in a horrifying way.
</p>

<p>
	Talking about dreams is all fun and games until you realize you dreamed up your mother. Then you shit your pants and cry.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, a video on solipsism is planned. I am not yet ready to talk about it.

<p>
	No. The difference is that I understand that all morality is invented and relative and selfish whereas JP and conservatives do not.
</p>

<p>
	I fully admit and embrace that my morality is groundless. It is purely my personal perference and bias. My morality is not normative nor objective. Not so for conservatives.

<title>Fear vs. Caution?</title>

<p>
	The difference is, fear is a charged emotion.
</p>

<p>
	Caution is not emotional. It's more of a cool, rational understanding and premeditated avoidance.
</p>

<p>
	If you are standing at the edge of a cliff, you could feel fear or you could not. But just because you feel no fear does not mean you must jump off. You could simply decide not to jump and you could take a step back to be sure a gust of wind doesn't blow you over. That's caution.

<p>
	I don't know.

<p>
	The problem is, people who follow my work are not hardcore full time monks. So my work cannot assume that. Just by watching my work already admits you are spiritually lazy and not willing to work hard like that monk. That's just the nature of YT.

<p>
	Pretty much. Although for some people it could activate kundalini. But that is not its core purpose.
</p>

<p>
	If you boil spirituality down to just raising kundalini then you'll miss a lot of amazing stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are 1 tool in the toolbox.

</p>

<p>
	A single video of mine might require a year of contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, this nihilism video is the result of 15 years of my contemplation and life experience. You could watch this videos for 15 years and still find new things in it.
</p>

<p>
	The stuff I talk about these days is very deep. Peole don't realize that. It will take most people years to realize how profound the ideas are.

<p>
	I don't think anything will. He is too attached to his human views of reality.
</p>

<p>
	He would need to deconstruct his whole mind. He is lost in the labyrinth of his own mind.
</p>

<p>
	Being more conscious than 90% of people is nice, but also not nearly enough to be speaking about God or Love.

The end.
</p>

<p>
	What you can dream is completely unlimited.
</p>

<p>
	As a newbie this will not help you. You need to do practices or psychedelics to become more conscious.
</p>

<p>
	If you want Truth you should be willing to burn every assumption to the ground. Including the assumption of other people.

<title>God Realization Video Question</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Imagine knowing EVERYTHING in the Universe perfectly.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how unexciting that is after a while.
</p>

<p>
	Do not take my words too literally. These are abstract pointers to things.
</p>

<p>
	If you were God you would want to be human. And if you were human you would want to be God. The grass is always greener on the other side. The finite seeks the infinite, the infinite seeks the finite. Two sides of a coin.

<p>
	No.
</p>

<p>
	But also what you will realize if you become conscious enough is that chakras are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Being really conscious and raising your kundalini are distinct and seperate things. You can have one without the other.

	His answer is pretty decent considering he isn't conscious that EVERYTHING is Love.
</p>

<p>
	His is a human sort of answer.

<p>
	Mine is a God sort of answer.

<p>
	You can't understand the answer without a profound God-realization awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Just the fact that you have such a negative attitude about solpsism already tells me that you are not ready for God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	You need answers but your cup is full.

	If you are as conscious as that monk you don't need guidance from this forum.

<p>
	Your logic is your own. It does not apply to me or even most other people.
</p>

<p>
	Practically speaking people who seek the end of suffering will never reach it because it tends to be a selfish and needy motivation.
</p>

<p>
	If what you live for is to end suffering, I feel sorry for you. Your life is so narrow. And, btw, the best way to do that is to kill yourself. This is what the desire to end suffering usually leads to in practice. It rarely leads to God.

<p>
	Dude, if she doesn't answer your texts you certainly cannot call her and game her. Learn to take a hint. She's not going to date you.
</p>

<p>
	Do you have any idea how many guys hit on a hot cashier? She gives out her number to 20 guys a week. Without rapport a number means nothing. Stop wasting your time hoping to get lucky. Learn to build real attraction rather than trying to get lucky. A 9/10 girl will not sleep with you out of sympathy.

<p>
	Basically do the work to move up the Spiral Dynamics stages. As we all move up the stages stuff like racism, selfishness, hatred, judgment, violence, war, terrorism, corruption, etc will all dramatically reduce. We don't really need aliens to help us with that. I doubt they even can.
</p>

	Also, we need more material wealth and economic development. Much of the world is simply held back from developing themselves psychologically and spiritually because they lack basic safety and material conditions. You cannot self-actualize in a warzone.

	It's like you're saying: the building is more important than the blueprint. But you cannot create a building without a blueprint. And the blueprint of the building is actually of a higher truth than the building itself. I don't care about the building as much as I care about the blueprint. Most people aren't like that. Most people just want the building and they don't care about the blueprint, because they are pretty selfish.
</p>

<p>
	This is not to say that embodiment is not important. It is important and I do care about it. But it is not the most important thing to me. Because you will always be able to understand way more than you will be able to embody. And not everything understood deserves embodiment. For example, I can understand Hitler without embodying him. Embodiment is a limited subset of pure understanding. If I place embodiment above understanding I would not understand many things because you simply don't have enough time to embody everything.

<p>
	I mean... I don't want to suffer. But ending it is not what excites me about life. My motivation for life is not negative, and I think people who place the end of suffering as their top priority are making a big mistake. To me, that is an act of selfishness.

			Just look at Owen, he has mastered some aspect of the social aspects in life. He is magnetic, extremely charismatic, knows how to "hang out" so that maximum number of people have a good time and probably knows how to say no, how to retreat.
		</p>

		<p>
			It's not just about dating that this works. Words can make somebody ruin your life, right words can cause your life, de-escalate conflict. Attract right kind of people. Socialy speaking, you are worth that what and how you are expressing. The streets got something for you. Either it can take everything from you and gice what you want. Have to be careful, sometimes it punishes your greed, somtimes your non-expression.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you were hostile to everybody, immagine how TERRIBLE your life would be, you would be on the street, because you can't properly relate to anybody, and on top of that, somebody would kill you for the smallest of things. So presenting yourself and enabling your self-expression is whats pick up seemingly can do, besides getting you laid, at least that's what tyler radiates.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course Owen teaches a lot more than just getting laid. But I was speaking about PUA as a whole. It is about getting laid. The rest is secondary in that community. Owen is a spiritual guy and he has lots of great ideas about more than getting laid, but he does not understand enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is: don't go to a PUA to get enlightened, as he will badly mislead you in that area.

<p>
	Enlightenment is when you realize you are God dreaming up the entire universe, including death.

<p>
	Obviously don't be trying to learn about enlightenment from a PUA. That is not his function. His function is to get you laid.

<p>
	It is less of a deception than a dream or imagination game. Since nothing can exist but via imagination, if you want to create a solid feeling realty, the only way to do it is via a very juicy/powerful illusion.

<p>
	See... here is the problem with your explanation. No matter what was disclosed about aliens or consciousness or whatever, 99%+ of the people of this planet would still be deeply selfish, biased, and corrupt, and thus all those problems of ignorance you mentioned would not disappear. Your conspiracy theory paints this picture of elites holding back the rest of mankind, but this is obviously not the case because it is 99% of mankind which is so ignorant and selfish that it unwilling to act in conscious and loving ways -- and it is they who elect the leaders.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a problem of anyone holding mankind back, it is problem of mankind simply not being developed enough.
</p>

<p>
	If the majority of normies cannot handle watching an Actualized.org video, how can you expect them to listen to some aliens talking about peace and love? They would just call the aliens evil and want to destroy them.

<p>
	You should try to get as much rapport and time as possible. Very short numbers will flake 95% of the time. Don't pride yourself on getting numbers, pride yourself on getting dates.
</p>

<p>
	You should always push for an insta-date right where you approach her. Walk her to a coffee.

<p>
	Generally the progression is this:
</p>

<p>
	1) You realize no-self.
</p>

<p>
	2) You realize Nothingness/Emptiness/Formlessnesss
</p>

<p>
	3) Then you realize The Self.
</p>

<p>
	4) Then you realize Formless =  Form
</p>

<p>
	It does not have to happen in that order, but this a very common progression.
</p>

<p>
	You need more consciousness to see that Formless = Form
</p>

<p>
	You progressively realize deeper and deeper that everything is ONE. All dualities merge into each other more and more and more and more until it gets so radical that you literally cannot tell the difference between anything.
</p>

<p>
	It's a slow process of defragmenting the mind until your mind becomes a perfect Unity. You are healing and unifying old divisions in your mind like, self vs other, life vs death, love vs hate, good vs bad, reality vs illusion, God vs self, truth vs love, something vs nothing, relative vs absolute, etc. In the very end you realize that everything equals everything else.

<p>
	Whatever you like.

<p>
	Mindfulness with labeling is very good because it is so rigorous. But tedious as hell.

<p>
	This is a problematic duality you've created.

<title>Question to Leo regarding day game</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/66319-question-to-leo-regarding-day-game/?do=findComment&amp;comment=908254</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	You don't need to demonstrate much high value during day game. The direct approach itself is enough, plus your confidence, body language, and humor.
</p>

<p>
	And of course you will suck at all that when you start. But you will improve. Just start approaching. Things will tend to auto-correct the more you do it.
</p>

<p>
	Lying isn't really necessary. You can literally make up stories and tell her you're making them up. For example, you can start telling her about how you and she are sitting on a beach in Hawaii drinking pina coladas. You can be very imaginative and fantastical with your conversation such that you are just spinning funny future-stories of you two together. And then you're not lying, it's just fun conversation.
</p>

<p>
	If you want interesting stories to tell, you can also just read a magazine or newspaper every day before you go out. That way you got some fresh material to talk about every day. You can tell her stories of interesting things you read in a magazine.
</p>

<p>
	Metal Floss magazine is good for this: <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.mentalfloss.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	It's just random factoids and weird stories.
</p>

<p>
	You can also just come up with stupid stories to say. For example, I would often open girls with the following: "Hey, me and my friend are starting a new business. It's a nutrition bar company. We will make nutrition bars from used up apple cores, Chinese newpapers, and bubblebees. We're calling it Bzzzzz. You should invest in our company." I got my first girlfriend from that stupid story.
</p>

<p>
	When you say stupid things, they don't have to be real or true and they don't count as lies because it's a joke.
</p>

<p>
	#1 rule of talking to women: Don't be serious. The dumber you are, the better.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course. Totally understandable.
</p>

<p>
	But on the other hand, if two people don't fit, it will break up eventually anyway.
</p>

<p>
	You should try to make it work, but if it keeps not working, at some point you gotta move on.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, if a girl gets emotionally upset at me for watching porn like in the movie clip above, she's not my kind of girl. I'm not saying she's wrong, I'm just saying I got different standards than her and I don't consider porn cheating. In fact, I would watch porn with her. To me it's just not an issue. But those are my standards. Of course some girls won't agree.
</p>

<p>
	Just get clear on your standards and values, and what you're willing to compromise on and what you're not. To me, a girl as needy and insecure as the movie clip above is a turn-off. I don't need that much drama in my life. That kind of emotional reaction is suitable when someone cheats on you, not over porn.
</p>

<p>
	Those are all facets of God.
</p>

<p>
	But you still have yet to grasp as a whole what God is and how it works.
</p>

<p>
	What is God? << that's the key question to crack. Answers such as "awareness" or "consciousness" or "nothingness" are partially correct, but not good enough. Those are glancing strikes. You must hit the nail right on the head to reach complete self-understanding.

<p>
	Of course. It's just a matter of realizing this more holistically.
</p>

<p>
	Look at your hands. Your body is God. This is what God looks like. God has a human body.
</p>

<p>
	God is a singular being who creates itself using infinite imagination. You are that being pretending to be human.
</p>

<p>
	You are an Infinite Dreamer. YOU! YOU! YOU! No one else but you. Just look at what you dreamed up.
</p>

<p>
	My work has a strong bias towards pure understanding. Pure understanding is not always useful and it does not promise you embodiment.
</p>

<p>
	My work is not results oriented. So if you care about maximizing results you have a different value set than me.

<p>
	Yes, the first stages of encountering God will have an "otherness" quality to it. You will probably not understand it is you, at first.
</p>

<p>
	Getting rid of all otherness takes lots of work.
</p>

<p>
	Many people hold the belief that being God is somehow arrogant or egotistical.

<p>
	I mean, good, but this is an online forum. It will have plenty of BS.
</p>

<p>
	Do not get some illusion that this forum will be some beacon of righteousness. It's a forum. On the internets. Don't forget that.
</p>

<p>
	If anything people take this place too seriously. This is a casual place with many loose ideas. People need to keep that in mind so that expectations are properly set. It's when people start taking this place too seriously that problems happen.
</p>

<p>
	It's good that you want to minimize your own BS. But this cannot be expected of every member here. They simply aren't capable of it. And we get new people every day.

<p>
	Yes, but that's not what is being considered in my question. The question is how to change the physical flow of material reality.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I once was so conscious I could almost reach a point where I could turn on and off the lights in my room using my mind. But I still was not conscious enough.
</p>

<p>
	According to my theory, if you become conscious enough you should be able to send an email to anyone in the world using your mind. The only thing stopping it is your lack of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Meh, most such people aren't gonna be powerful enough to perform miracles.

<p>
	I think the real key is having insane levels of consciousness -- beyond even what most psychedelics allow. I just don't know how it can be sustained.

<p>
	You can develop many soul mates. Intimacy can be consciously created. It doesn't just have to be something that thrusts itself on you.
</p>

<p>
	Take responsibly for creating your soul mate connection.

<p>

<title>Why does God leave Breadcrumbs?</title>

<p>
	Of course. But what you don't realize is that it would be unGodlike to thrust Infinity on a normie. That is like if God dumped a metric ton of gold coins on a panhandler. It's not as good as you imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Since YOU are God, the problem is not that YOU are the obstacle to your own God-realization. You're preventing it from happening by getting lost in survival and fear and attachment.
</p>

<p>
	You are treating this problem as through it is outside of you. But it's not outside of you. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM! For God to solve your problem he would have to kill you. And you call this evil.
</p>

<p>
	How would you feel if you came to me for enlightenment and I beat you in the head with a baseball bat until your ego was gone. Would you like that? To force awakening on someone who doesn't want it is basically a form of torture.

<p>
	What's so confusing? If a human body can die unconsciously why can't a human body die consciously?
</p>

<p>
	Mahasamadhi makes little sense for a young person who still has a full life ahead of them. But if you're some crusty old 70 year old enlightened master and you got not much else to do, Mahasamadhi may be the perfect exist plan.
</p>

<p>
	(Remember: Mahasamadhi is NOT achieved through physical action but internally.)

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	To me the answer is very simple: start your own business and make it successful. By the time you finish that, which should take about 5 years, you should have a solid grasp of Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Of course that is not the only way. But I think it's one of the most powerful and it worked very well for me.
</p>

<p>
	Of course starting a successful business is very challenging. But that's what makes the growth so solid.
</p>

<p>
	If you are not a business type person, you could also pour that same effort into a career of some kind.
</p>

<p>
	Starting a business is one of the biggest growth opportunities in life.
</p>

<p>
	Integrating Orange is about being very proactive about your success in life. Stop sitting around and taking it easy. Go hustle and work your ass off. Go take a Tony Robbins seminar.
</p>

<p>
	Because I feel it is more truthful and authentic.
</p>

<p>
	To me a real speaker should be able to speak without edits.
</p>

<p>
	Real life rarely gives you the luxury of editing what comes out of your mouth, so I figure why not just learn to speak fluently?
</p>

<p>
	You also would not believe how much time it saves in the editing using. In the amount of time a typical YTer spends editing his 15 minute video, I can record a profound 2 hour talk.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This would be like the pinnacle of this work.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect it to come quickly or easily.
</p>

<p>
	The desire to achieve a permanent carefree state will itself backfire and create lots of suffering as you will always be upset that, "Why am I not in a carefree state yet?" This can actually make you very miserable and depressed.
</p>

<p>
	So the solution here is to pursue awakening and liberation, BUT for fuck's sake, enjoy the journey and don't wait to be happy. Be happy now, regardless of whatever shit is imperfect in your life, regardless of your state.
</p>

<p>
	Waiting for a state to solve all your problems is not a healthy or effective attitude for this work. A much better attitude is to be willing to get dirty with life, to get beat up and keep going no matter what. Stop asking for life to be easy. Stop seeking too much personal comfort. Embrace the challenge and brutality of life.
</p>

<p>
	I have been getting more strict over the years relative to where we started.
</p>

<p>
	And it actually did improve the overall quality.
</p>

<p>
	However, as soon as we move in that direction people love to scream censorship, and it appears tyrannical and cult-like, as people say that only yes-men are allowed.
</p>

<p>
	It's a very challenging needle to thread. This forum has taught me a lot about the appeal of authoritarian rule. It's very tempting to just impose my will on the whole thing. But then people get disgruntled as they do in all authoritarian regimes. But the irony is that authoritarian rule, when done properly, yields to a better overall result. It's just that it pisses people off in the process. So it has a cost.
</p>

<p>
	This forum works almost like a small scale replica of a government. And it makes you appreciate how difficult it is to lead a government. It's much harder than it seems to strike the right balance between freedom and order. It's herding cats with sensitive egos, most of whom feel like they are not being listened to.

<p>
	They are the same. Just a matter of depth and totality. The latest one was a lot deeper, revealing more of how the dream is constructed.
</p>

<p>
	When you go really deep it feels like you're looking at the Matrix and seeing how it is constructed while you're in it. For example, you can watch you construct your own hands into existence or your own parents.
</p>

<p>
	You become the God process. You see how creation is occurring on the fly.

<p>
	Honestly, in retrospect. All of the workshops and retreats I've done over the years in various places, very few of them disclose how bad things can get in the worst case scenarios. That info is kept well in the back pocket until you're already a veteran and then you catch wind of wild stories. They are also not honest about their result numbers. Way inflated. Far fewer people get woke than advertised. Like WAY fewer.
</p>

<p>
	The nice thing with physical retreats is that there is a lot more control and supervision possible because it is an expensive paid event and it only lasts a week or two. It is not ongoing 24/7/365 with a rotating cast of 500 anonymous characters.

<p>
	Honestly, running a forum is the worse business decision you'll ever make. It eats up all your time and earns you nothing.
</p>

<p>
	And the brand liability is enormous because you will get crazy people doing crazy things.

<p>
	It's really something that you should do if you're passionate about building a community. It's not a good business thing.

<p>
	No. Kids pass through all the lower stages, but more rapidly if the culture is higher, and sometimes fail to integrate the lower stages fully. Kid might rise to Green as a teen, but will likely not have a solid Red, Blue, Orange. But it depends on how the kid is raised.

<p>
	In between Yellow and Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	And still some work left to do on Tier 1. There's basically always lower stage work to do. Stages run deep. Shadows are easily developed and hard to unlearn.

<p>
	This is a list of action steps in each Spiral video for how to evolve to the next stage. Did you not hear it?
</p>

<p>
	Reading the Spiral Dynamics books is a great way to being the transition from Green to Yellow. You will become Yellow when you stop judging the lower stages and start understanding them as valid but limited POVs.
</p>

<p>
	As far as your job situation goes, it would be smart to start looking for a job which lets you be around stage Green or Yellow people.

<p>
	If you become infinitely conscious, you will know all there is to know.
</p>

<p>
	I cannot give you the answer to the "other" question. You must come to it yourself.

<p>
	Anyhow, let's not derail this thread any more with the solipsism question here.

<p>
	This is not accurate. I didn't say the ONLY thing. You can do multiple things. I just said handling survival is important.
</p>

<p>
	There is no reason why you can't ready metaphysics as a hobby while working on your business. In fact, that's how my journey started! I didn't start with metaphysics and philosophy full time. I gradually ramped into it over the years while building out my normal life and doing business. Business by day, philosophy by night.

<p>
	It's hard to say. You can do a bit of work each day, but it might be best if you set aside 10 days per year for a hardcore retreat. Or some combination of the two. It all depends on how your life is structured. I don't know what you got going on.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's hard to say. The fastest path would be something like an ayahausca retreat or a hardcore 10 day meditation retreat.
</p>

<p>
	These would not get you to God-realization but they might yield some juicy mystical experiences or a minor awakening -- which is all you need to start.
</p>

<p>
	Don't worry about God-realization right now. Start with some basic mystical experiences.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Very hard to say. Depends on your goals and desires and biggest needs.
</p>

<p>
	Reading books is probably the easiest way to start. You learn good ideas and can contemplate a plan of what is most worth doing. Sorting out your job/career is probably one of the biggest pieces as far as basic self-help goes. Do you enjoy your work? If not, you should work to fix that.
</p>

<p>
	The LP Course offers a very solid foundation for newbies to find their direction in life. But it is not about spiritual work.

<p>
	What you're not aware of is that if you become more conscious than Rupert Spira you will realize he's not fully conscious that he is imaging all other minds, and that you are imaging him imaging other minds.
</p>

<p>
	Like I have told you guys before, you are falling into the trap of taking these gurus on their word. You are not questioning Spira enough. You assume he has it figured out. And what I am telling you is: he does not. This is not an attack on him. This is something I say for your own benefit if you wish to fully awaken someday.
</p>

<p>
	I know you guys don't like to believe it, but I'm telling you simply that I have accessed levels of consciousness which go beyond what you hear from famous neo-Advita teachers. But hey, find out for yourself what is true.

<p>
	You're not aware that all those points of view are imagined by you. You even imagine Rupert Spira.

<p>
	This is an excuse and a rationalization for not becoming more conscious of what other minds are.
</p>

<p>
	You can become directly conscious of all other minds. If you want. And then you will understand what they are.
</p>

<p>
	This realization cannot be reached through the words or logic of any guru.

			1:04:00 you talk about Christianity , and how we can make anything dangerous when we misunderstand etc.. But in Christianity in particular there is a safeguard rail. It is very commonly known for Christians that if you commit suicide you won't be allowed in the kingdom of Heaven. Basically exactly what SoonHei was looking for with that jump - to find/ be in heaven itself.
		</p>

		<p>
			If he believed a little bit that what Christianity is saying is relevant, it would have challenged his idea that jumping would get him quick access to that. He would probably be here if he had more of a Christian background and had this doubt about the suicide being "Good", because there is "nowhere else to go". 
		</p>

		<p>
			About "Repent and you will be allowed in Heaven" being like a visa to do anything, it might appear like that, sure.. But I have had an insight about that one... How would one feel, when in Heaven, knowing that they don't deserve it... It would not be a good feeling and it would make heaven into a kind of hell, where you are like an undeserving dirt.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is not a critique on your teachings, it is a critique of your critique of Christianity.

<p>
	The mind will rationalize whatever it wants to do. It will also conveniently neglect things it even knows.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe the 10 Commandments say that killing is wrong. But a foolish person will reason like this: "Killing babies is wrong. So I'm going to go kill that abortion doctor who kills babies because he is breaking the 10 Commandments!" And there will be no recognition at all that killing the doctor also breaks the 10 Commandments.
</p>

<p>
	You assume the mind is going to be very rigorous and consider all sides of the issue but it will not. It will ignore obvious warnings and prohibitions.
</p>

<p>
	You honestly think that SoonHei never heard it said that Truth is NOW, the present moment? He obviously knew what. His sister told me that he Eckhart Tolle quotes on his dreamboard and talked about many spiritual authors he's read. So obviously he knew that NOW is the place to be. But he ignored that for some fantasy of a future Mahasamadhi heaven.
</p>

<p>
	When the mind gets stuck on some fantasy, it's logic becomes one-sided and anything can be justified in that way.
</p>

<p>
	You think suicide bombers don't know it's wrong to kill civilians? They know it. But they get trapped in some other fantasy and ignore basic common sense.
</p>

<p>
	This is a common misconception.
</p>

<p>
	It is actually possible to become so conscious that reincarnation itself is seen to be imaginary. So you transcend even reincarnation.
</p>

<p>
	So it very much is possible to understand such things. It's not belief or speculation. You can realize it directly.

	That's exactly my point. You are looking for war. And you create it.
</p>

<p>
	It would be wise if you made a distinction between looking for a fight vs seeking genuine understanding.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you are not even interested in considering the possibility that Actualized.org offers people some genuine understanding of life. You just dismiss that possibility from the start because that's boring to you. You want some red meat to throw to the dogs. But as you do this you actually promote egotism and ignorance -- not genuine understanding. And you slander my brand. Then you act surprised when the slandered party calls out what you are doing.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Actually no. The bad PR is something you create but take no responsibility for.
</p>

<p>
	I do not control the lives of my viewers. If one of my viewers wants to jump off a bridge, he has that right. And I do not know what he is doing or why. Precisely because this is not a cult. I have very little oversight of people here. It's like herding cats here, not sheep.
</p>

<p>
	If you were an honest actor you would see that.
</p>

<p>
	We have a rather libertarian philosophy here of: as little control over people as we can get away with and still maintain an non-toxic forum.

<p>
	Actually that's not my problem, that's your problem.
</p>

<p>
	Precisely because this place is not a cult, I have no control over how members here express themselves on your YT channel. Nor do I care to micromanage what member here say to you.
</p>

<p>
	All I would ask my members to do is to not be rude, don't attack anyone, don't start fights, and try not to get goaded into flame wars and drama. In other words: BE CONSCIOUS! Which is all I basically teach. Just be fucking conscious if you can. Simple, timeless advice that is guaranteed to work.
</p>

<p>
	What this situation requires is deescalation. If people here keep escalating, it will get escalated. And that's how war happens, FYI.
</p>

<p>
	War sorta goes against my teachings, in case that wasn't obvious.
</p>

<p>
	It would be wise of you to acknowledge that the way you do your videos is fuel for the reptilian brain, so don't be too surprised when you call everything a cult, that you get people who vehemently disagree with you.
</p>

<p>
	It's a rather low blow to call something people love a cult, and then when they respond to you passionately that it is not a cult, then you use that as evidence to validate your original theory. This is called confirmation bias and self-fulfilling prophecy 101 and there's nothing nuanced or sophisticated about how that works. This is basic self-deception and it misinforms your own viewers who I assume you would rather be educating rather than triggering.
</p>

<p>
	See... you could do this with any popular brand. You could call CNN a cult, you could call Tesla a cult, you could call any spiritual teacher a cult, you could call Nintendo a cult, you could even call a university a cult -- and if the brand has passionate fans you will have triggered them to instinctively attack you, and then you would use that as evidence that they are a cult. But what you're doing there is not anything rational or scientific, it is just poking a hornet's nest.
</p>

<p>
	When you make triggery videos, people get triggered.
</p>

<p>
	If you're going to be using the cult word, maybe actually read some books about what cults are and are not. Or if you don't want to read, I have videos about it: Cult Psychology - Part 1 and Cult Psychology - Part 2.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with your critiques is that you clearly have not listened to much of my teachings. Or if you listened, you were listening with an eye for clickbait drama psychedelic stuff rather than actually bothering to hear the teaching.
</p>

<p>
	Your idea of God is one breadcrumb, which, if followed, will lead you to the real thing.
</p>

<p>
	Don't over-think this. Don't psyche yourself out. It's not so complicated. You are God. Now just become conscious of this. That's all.

<p>
	The illusion is not always so great. It's fun for a while but you don't want to be stuck in it forever.
</p>

<p>
	If God didn't leave a breadcrumb trail you would be here asking: "Why is God so evil to lock me forever in this illusion of suffering?"
</p>

<p>
	The breadcrumb trail is so subtle that 99% of people won't follow it. To follow it requires a serious desire. So it's actually a pretty clever design. It satisfies both kinds of people: those you want to escape and those who don't.
</p>

<p>
	"abused the Truth" is a relative notion. If he is happy with his action then good for him. But we gotta deal with the fallout which requires telling people that our teachings have never been about physical harm to the body. Which is true.

<p>
	If this forum continues for years, we will definitely have more suicidal people joining and there is always a possibility of someone following thru on it. There is no way I can prevent that. There are 40,000 suicides every year in the USA alone.
</p>

<p>
	If I am going to be personally held responsible for every suicide that someone who sees one of my videos commits, then basically there cannot be a forum, or a comment section, or videos. Holding me personally responsible for the suicide of a person I have never talked to is an absurd standard which you would never hold any serious professional to. And you would feel outraged if anyone held you to such standard.

			<strong>Consciousness work</strong> :  I find value in your work when it comes to your trip reports, protocols and research. There are few contradictions for instance when you say "what I communicate is only what is true at my current level of consciousness, it couldn't be otherwise" but then you threaten to ban anyone who challenges that love is the ultimate, or temporary experience doesn't make it less true. As per your first statement, and you made false statements in the past (eg. that you were rewiring your brain during your enlightenment experience on youtube, or the healing in god mode) someday you may hit a permanent experience or understanding and speak differently.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That is the nature of teaching and communication.
</p>

<p>
	I could make the same counter-argument to those who deny Love as Absolute. I could say, "You are just being dogmatic and one day you may change your mind."
</p>

<p>
	There are always going to be some things within a body of teaching which are core to the teaching we the teacher will refuse to compromise on. This is true of any teacher or teaching.
</p>

<p>
	If you go to a Zen master and say, "But what if the Buddha wasn't enlightened? What if you are deluded?" The Zen master will laugh at you and kick you out of his zendo. Because if you truly feel the Buddha wasn't enlightened, you have no business being in a Zen classroom. You should go do more productive thing.
</p>

<p>
	Endlessly arguing about spiritual topics is extremely counter-productive to spiritual work. Which is why we cannot have endless in-fighting and debate here. The problem is one of distraction. I want you doing the work, not arguing about Love.
</p>

<p>
	Love to me is absolutely fundamental to this work. If you believe I'm deluded, fine, but then why are you here? Go follow someone who isn't deluded according to your logic. I will not compromise on Love. You can torture me and I will still tell you that Love is Absolute Truth. If you think that's closedminded and delusional, well, I cannot help you. You actually misunderstand what openmindedness means in this case.

			<strong>Conscious politics</strong> : I mostly disagree with your entire conscious politics arc :
		</p>

		<p>
			- Spiral dynamics : its merit is to introduce some common vocabulary and framework of understanding but to me is fundamentally flawed, especially the idea of verticality  (one stage is superior to the other). Let's compare stage blue and stage yellow : a stage blue farmer has a life of hard labour, has to work from 6am to 7pm, has little to no entertainment, manages to live like this for decades supported by his religiousness. A yellow stage academics spends his day debating people, living in his head building models and imagining interactions between systems but has the luxury of this time only because the blue farmer is producing food for him. If the academic had to replace the farmer he would have no clue and couldn't handle the rigor of such a life, physically exhausting, no mental entertainment, he would be unable to take over the farm. How can you say that the stage yellow is superior to the blue stage ? The blue farmer is a stronger being than the yellow academics on many levels (and the yellow is stronger on others, they are complimentary not superior/inferior). One counter argument is to say that the farmer can be yellow and the academics blue, it highlights another flaw of the SD : you can twist the SD model any way you want, if something doesn't fit your narrative just add a bit of percentage, eg "he has some green which explains why he said that but he really is mostly orange !",  it has no predictive value. Saying Trump is red is an illustration of that, you're putting him on the same level as a low education burglar or murderer.
		</p>

		<p>
			- Trump/conservatives : This point is linked with the SD point because there is the underlying notion of value that I disagree with. First you say that all criticism is untenable, that you are Trump and Trump is Leo, that love is the ultimate, etc. Yet you are so strongly biased against Trump that it throws all the previous statements in the bin and make you look like you don't integrate your own realizations. And don't say that your stance on Trump is compatible with those statements, you nag him, you call him stupid, you are not equanimous. I don't feel strongly about Trump either way, my problem is the implication of your stance to your respect of democracy. Trump is not Hitler, to my knowledge he never made hateful comments about races or minorities unlike Hitler, the idea he would put people into death camps isn't serious. Now Trump got elected on key ideas that he advertised clearly, and those ideas are certainly in the purview of democracy. Tightening borders is in the purview of a democracy, citizens have the right to tighten their borders, medicare, monetary policy, foreign affairs, etc all those are in the purview of a democracy. Once he was elected his political opponents should have folded to some extent and reevaluated their positions towards the choice that had been made, this is democracy. If all you do is resist everything and refuse to reevaluate the slightest then you are not a democrat (as in pro-democracy).
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's fine. I'm happy to have discussions about political stuff and SD. I'm not concerned much about disagreements there. I'm more concerned about constant debates about core spiritual truths which do not progress a seek in any meaningful way.
</p>

<p>
	Do not debate Love. Go become conscious of it. Or don't.
</p>

<p>
	The reason for seeking to minimize debate is not for the sake my ego. The point is to create an environment in which people's reptilian brains are not constantly triggered into ideological battle. These ideological battles make spiritual work impossible. I don't like debate because it is extremely unproductive. And then we have to waste a lot of time moderating it.

<p>
	Well, actually, I'm experimenting with imagination techniques with the hopes of finding some good ones.
</p>

<p>
	You also have to keep in mind that my work is always unfolding and new stuff is being researched.
</p>

<p>
	People have this desire to "be done" with it all, and they then tend to treat my teachings as such too. Whereas I treat the whole thing as a very long exploration and journey. But people love to bash the spiritual journey and just say, "Be done and stop seeking, if you're still seeking then you are doing it wrong." This is ridiculous position to take because I'm not in the business of merely reaching enlightened ASAP. I'm in the business of exploring new ways of doing spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people just don't understand this idea of pioneering something new. They like to dismiss it as ego.

			Here's where I stand. 
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Your work has not only changed my life and helped actually turned my life around but also helped lay the ground work to not give in to suicide when I was at my most suicidal. I ran into your work after being in a hospital and it showed me the way out such that I now have had several enlightenment experiences, my relationships are better than ever, I've turned around many of the things that I've been traumatized by since I was kid including things like ADHD by providing resources and outlets and also community to find what I've been looking for my entire life.
			</li>
			<li>
				Your work has provided me a community such that I've met people in person that have helped me turn my life around 180 degrees.
			</li>
			<li>
				When I came across what you had to say about psychedelics in the early days I was on 5-7 different psych medications that were destroying my very cognition to the point where I couldn't function anymore. I was taking 2-4 hour naps everyday, barely able to stay awake, could barely drive, and at my lowest point in terms of sheer hopelessness and depression. I trusted what you had to say about psychedelics and that you recommended a slow gradual approach and also how they are not safe to mix with SSRI's, mood stabilizers, and such substances. I trusted you and I actually got off all my meds and abandoned the system was doing more damage so I could try this route in order to get to the root of my own suffering and deepest demons. Turns out, by and large, through extensive research (which you recommended), trial and error, a careful methodical approach, it did help me with just that. However, like you also said, they were no magic pill in that I still had to follow up and do the heavy lifting. 
			</li>
			<li>
				You provided resources to teachers, some of whom have become some my own teachers personally. If it wasn't for you, I don't know if I would've found them. I imagine not though. 
			</li>
			<li>
				In March of 2020 I had my first spontaneous powerful kensho/satori where it was clear that no experience is ever enlightenment. So I do disagree with you when it comes to that. However, I've also seen you say that you are simply a gateway for newbies. That's what you were for me. I've also met plenty of other teachers (I just had dinner with one) that I disagree with about things they deluded about and I think you know a lot more on when it comes to society, government, mind, etc. Teachers and people in this work disagree in one fashion or another and it's expressed in about as many ways as there have been people. So I don't hold hard feelings like that. I think people are probably going to get lead astray if they just sheepishly take what you have to say, hear it, have some experience (psychedelic or otherwise) and taint whatever experience they have and lay some conceptual layering over it which is comprised of their interpretations they have of what you say based on what they create in their mind. I may think you're incorrect but they're responsible for their end. So I don't feel it's fair for me to fault you on that. 
			</li>
			<li>
				Although I disagree with you about awakening I do think your contributions on psychology, development, and so forth is solid enough and I think you are of great service. I can nit pick but it's just nit picking.
			</li>
			<li>
				I don't consider you my teacher. To be honest you never were for me. You were a guy very similar to me, as far as I could tell from videos, which is extremely limited (for all I know you could have children chained to a radiator in your basement - assuming people in Vegas have basements...) that showed me the way, the path to what it was I looking for my entire life but didn't know it. And I will always be thankful for that. Anybody that says your video promote suicide can talk to me and I'll tell them to go fuck themselves. 
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Make of that what you will. 
		</p>

<p>
	Thanks for your feedback and support.

	I released a video last month called "Is Actualized.org A Cult?" in which I told people clearly: "Commit to never harming your body. Ego death is not physical death."

<p>
	It is pointless for me to make more videos when people don't watch the old ones which clearly explain all these things.

<p>
	You think I'm some fool who has never considered that somebody might twist my teachings into some evil and stupidity? I have issued all kinds of warnings for years. This is not some recent development. All of this was foreseen years ago. I told you many times that people would look for ways to corrupt my teachings. Here we are.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental problem here is that I teach truthful things every directly. And people just don't handle it well. They take it personally. As egos love to do. I have worked hard to stay authentic to my style of direct and blunt teachers because that is what my heart is into. I do not like beating around the bush with people and withholding things.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I should clarify. I am not dismissive of manual practices to the point of saying they shouldn't be done. I would say I'm just more realistic about them.
</p>

<p>
	Having attended plenty of meditation treats and others places which stressed manual practices, what I saw was many, many people who were basically clueless in their levels of consciousness. And these were not newbies. These were serious meditators with 10+ years of experience. So after seeing that, I realized that this whole meditation and self-inquiry thing is a racket. It's designed to lure people in with sweet promises and then not delivering them.
</p>

<p>
	The objective facts are on my side. If meditation and self-inquiry are so effective as you believe, then why are 98% of meditators not awake? Why don't know what God is? Why can't they say what Love is? Why don't they understand what Infinity is? Why can't they answer basic metaphysical questions about reality and consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	The answer is simple: meditation can work, but it rarely gets you that high unless you are ridiculously good at it and you do it as a full-time job.
</p>

<p>
	Again, to be crystal clear: manual practices are very important! But they are really mostly suitable for hardcore practioners. And still, you will not become as conscious as you could with psychedelics, unless maybe you are a genetic spiritual freak.
</p>

<p>
	I am tired of spiritual teachings which leave most people clueless and in the dark and struggling with decades of sitting on the cushion. Those teachings already exist, they are ridiculously ineffective, and I have no desire to recreate another such teaching. If that's what you want, go have it. Why do you need Actualized.org to rehash it for you? Go do Vipassana. See how far you get. The typical person won't get far. Hence I de-emphasize that stuff.
</p>

<p>
	The world needs a new way of doing spirituality which is more direct, more effective. My job is to research and share that way. Maybe you think I'm deluded for attempting that, but even if I fail, to me it was a worthwhile goal. And I have already discovered many amazing ways to speed things up. If only people are willing to listen and practice.
</p>

<p>
	Clearing misconceptions is exactly my goal. But any time I try to clear a misconception it will be framed as drama, defensiveness, ego, etc. It's just all the classic smear-merchant stuff. None of this is new. This how politics works. When someone is a threat to you, you smear them. Oldest ego trick in the book.

</p>

<p>
	God is not an easy thing to stomach.
</p>

<p>
	But assuming you dissolve much of that ego, then God is the most beautiful and enjoyable thing. It's like magic.
</p>

<p>
	Life is totally meaningless, but you can enjoy it regardless.
</p>

<p>
	Seeking God is for people who appreciate understanding the Truth of what the Universe is. If you really loved the Universe, you would want to understand what it is and why it is.

<p>
	The building blocks of reality are not atoms, they are differences.
</p>

<p>
	It is not that differences aren't experienced, obviously they are. It's that these differences are imaginary and change at any time.
</p>

<p>
	What is salt? Salt is literally the difference you imagine between it and pepper, and every other thing in the universe. But if you realize those differences at all imaginary, there will literally stop being a difference between salt and pepper. Salt and pepper will become one thing.
</p>

<p>
	Your mistake, as it turns out, was to assume that salt and pepper are distinct rigid material objects.
</p>

			This is a comment I was going to leave on the other thread in response to Leo's reaction to video <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/7840-kieranperez/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="7840" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/7840-kieranperez/" rel="">@kieranperez</a> posted. It's directed at Leo but anyone who feels to respond feel free 
		</p>

		<p>
			@LeoGura I thought the discussion was open and as @Forestluv said they came at with good faith. I do agree that they misunderstood some of your pointers and teachings, however they made valid points about some of the culture on the forum which has been brought up before in terms of turning non duality into an almost religious rhetoric.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I fundamentally disagree with this characterization of my work and rhetoric.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing religious or dogmatic about what I teach. Just the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	In that video, both people were speaking from ego, neither person was even remotely close to having a deep grasp of spirituality, and they deep and fundamentally mischaracterized my work, Spiral Dynamics, levels and facets of awakening, and so many other points that it's hard to list all the ignorance in that video.
</p>

<p>
	That video is precisely ignorance which misleads people.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing on this forum is about a competition for who is more awake. This is completely antithetical to my teachings. Nobody here is in competition for being most woke or most spiritual or most Spirally developed. All that is pure projection and strawmanning.
</p>

<p>
	I talk about higher and higher levels of awakening only for one simple reason: That's precisely my experience of the spiritual path. And any serious spiritual seeker will relate. It has nothing to do with ego or wanting to escape the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	The things said in that video are so fallacious and slanderous that I would be laughing had it no influence on a gullible audience.
</p>

<p>
	I'm honestly baffled how Adeptus can do so much psychedelics -- and run an entire psychedelic channel -- yet be so clueless about spiritual work and what the psychedelic experiences mean.

			One of my fundamental, perceived, disagreements is your dismissal of manual practices like meditation. Not that you dismiss them per-say, but that you significantly down play their effectiveness due to a personal lack of success and label the people who have serious success with them as “spiritually gifted.”
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, good.
</p>

<p>
	You are right. I do dismiss manual practices for several valid reasons which I have explained in the past:
</p>

<p>
	1) Most people will not be successful with them. The factual evidence of this is very clear. Almost no meditators are deeply awake or even have a clue what God or Truth is.
</p>

<p>
	2) Most people are not motivated enough to do them. And part of my job is motivation.
</p>

<p>
	3) Even those people who do years of manual practice will almost certainly not reach the levels of consciousness that I speak of. This is also borne out by factual evidence and real-world experience talking to meditators.
</p>

<p>
	4) For meditation to be effective is requires 100s of continuous practice. This is very hardcore and most people don't have the time for that.
</p>

<p>
	5) There are some people who can meditate with little effort and get huge results quickly. Such people are rare and spiritually gifted without even realizing it.
</p>

<p>
	These are actually profoundly important points for any newbie spiritual seeker to understand.
</p>

<p>
	And finally, I still believe manual practices are important and even necessary. But for them to be effective people first need to be exposed to mystical experiences, otherwise there will be no motivation or even an idea of what meditation is for.

And I am mindful of the problem of creating a echo-chamber. That's not what I'm aiming for. I do not want a bunch of yes-men here kissing my ass.

			The only point that keeps cropping up in my mind that I think is worth sharing here is on the nature of progression. It's undoutable that you did a lot of so called 'traditional' spiritual work regarding non-duality and no-self and so on before you started giving the God-realisation and Love teachings.
		</p>

		<p>
			Do you think that for anyone else who also wishes to explore God-realisation and Love, these other steps are important grounding work before one can tackle more advanced teachings?

<p>
	Of course it's important.
</p>

<p>
	Much of the stuff I teach is grounding work. I am all for doing the basics.

			When you said the universe would end, and discussed Mahasamadhi, I could not quite tell whether you were talking in a relative or absolute sense... That is, by "take everyone with you" etc. is that the relative sense? Like Yogis prior who went through with the act, they died and we are still here. You also spoke of final preparations... So did you expect relative experience would continue or all subjevtivity to cut out. Essentially from my relative experience I too would have died and ceased to exist?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In that case I meant it in the most Absolute and final and radical sense. In other words, literally, nothing would remain. No, you're not still here at that point. Mahasamadhi does not mean you're still here.
</p>

<p>
	No material experience at all would continue. It's effectively death, for real. You don't cease to exist, you become an infinitely conscious singularity.
</p>

<p>
	WARNING: I do not recommend Mahasamadhi for any of you. It is to radical and you will kill yourself if you go down that road. And I don't mean merely ego-death. Mahasamadhi is not something anyone here should be thinking about. And it's also not what I teach. I spoke of it in that episode simply because I got close to it personally and I wanted to share it as a cautionary tale with you. It was not a pleasant experience for me to get that close.

<p>
	I have explained Love a lot in my videos: What Is Love - Part 1 & 2, and elsewhere. Watch those again.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not merely understanding. Love is all the physical such that exists. Love is also the realization that there is not difference whatsoever between anything. When you realize that there is literally no difference between an orgasm and cancer, you will realize what Love is.

<p>
	Consider the possibilities that these are not fallacies but actually high consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you become conscious enough, you will literally be so conscious that you won't see any difference between licking ice cream and licking a hot stove. These radical levels of consciousness are obviously dangerous, and I have warned people about it in the past in my discussions of psychedelic dangers.
</p>

<p>
	How do you supposed a Tibetan monk does self-immolation? He literally is so conscious that he cannot tell the difference between setting himself on fire vs otherwise. The difference between pleasure and pain is ultimately imaginary. This very much fucks with your survival. You see? After you deconstruct pain, you have to be careful and wise not to do something stupid like stick your hand in woodchipper, because pain and fear won't be holding you back any more.

<p>
	Yes, but you're overlooking the obvious: it's true.
</p>

<p>
	It is true that harming the body does not matter after a certain level of consciousness is reached. This is nothing new that I invented. This is part of age-old mystical teachings. Yogis train to sleep on a bed of nails. That's what strong determination sitting is about. Those sits are not good for the body, but the meditator does not care.
</p>

<p>
	Just because SoonHei decided to jump off a bridge in a tragic way does not in any way change what is true about pain and consciousness. He simply abused that truth. Truth itself makes no prescriptions. How you use the truth requires intelligence, wisdom, responsibility, and consciousness.

<p>
	The truth is that there is no reason to not jump off a bridge. You are free to do whatever you want. If you want to jump off a bridge, no one can stop you and even your own mind may not stop you.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that most people don't jump off bridges because they fear death and because they enjoy life. As soon as you stop fearing life and stop enjoying life, you will probably jump off a bridge. So I recommend you enjoy life more. If you really love life, you will stick around to enjoy it. And if you don't, no force on Earth will stop you from killing yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You should note, all of my teachings are life-affirming. I talk about having a passion for life and building a great life and loving life. I do not talk about life as something to run away from or escape. Life is beautiful. So stick around.

<p>
	The human body does limit your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You guys seem to confuse two things: 1) Statements of truth, vs 2) What you should do about it.
</p>

<p>
	Many things are true but that does say anything about what you ought to do.
</p>

<p>
	If a yogi tells you that the body limits consciousness, that does not mean you should kill the body.
</p>

<p>
	The body has certain fundamental limits. What you do about it up to you. I have never said to harm the body as a means of raising consciousness. Harming the body NEVER been a valid Actualized.org technique. Look through all of my teaching and one example where I told you that harming the body is valid technique which I endorse. I have obviously never said that because it would deeply irresponsible.

	Also, guys, please... those of you who support my work, do not attack, harass, or aggressively defend me in public or on other channels, etc. Because people will just use that to further demonize and misunderstand what we do here. Be polite and not too aggressive. The way this PR game works it that the more you try to defend Actualized.org, the more people will call you a delusional cult member. So you have to be smart about the PR game here. This is not about truth anymore, this is all a PR game now. This is collective ego survival 101. So those who will be attacking and demonzing Actualized.org will not care about truth, they will care about validating their worldview. And in their worldview Actualized.org is, of course, very conveniently, a dangerous cult. That will always be the easiest, laziest angle of attack.

<p>
	Everything I read on this forum is feedback. But of course that doesn't mean I agree with it necessarily or that I will adopt it.
</p>

<p>
	But yes, this thread is very much about feedback and I will certainly use the lessons here to make future decisions about how to best structure my teachings and how to deal with people in general.
</p>

<p>
	This is not just a thread to cull people out who are critics.
</p>

<p>
	I am open to criticism. That is nothing new to me. I get criticized every day. Any healthy community must be open to feedback and criticism. The issue here is that I see A LOT of people fundamentally misunderstanding my teachings. Either they don't watch the videos or they just got some twisted ideas about what is said. It is those misunderstandings that I want to squash.
</p>

<p>
	My first responsibility is to make sure that my teachings are correctly understood and not misunderstood. So that's the purpose behind what I'm doing now. I see way to much misunderstanding and that frustrates me. But I'll deal with it.

<p>
	No, that does not sound like a clear no-self. That was a glimpse into what consciousness is and a seeing through the illusion of materialism.
</p>

<p>
	No-self is simply when you clearly realize there never was a human self. It will fee like: "OF COURSE! How could I have been dumb as to ever believe there was a self?!!! What the fuck is a 'self' anyway?!!! Of course there's no self!"
</p>

<p>
	It's very clear and obvious when you hit it.
</p>

<p>
	It will help you to contemplate: "What is a self?"

<title>Major Discussion Of Actualized.org Teachings &amp; The Future</title>

<p>
	<strong>Edited: After some deeper reflection, I am modifying my original post be more open and accommodating.</strong>
</p>

<p>
	This will be a master thread of sorts for dealing with the fallout of recent events, specifically focused on clarifying and discussing the nature of my work and Actualized.org as a whole.
</p>

<p>
	This community and my followers are going to go through a self-sorting. Whatever grievances you have with my teachings, express it here.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe my work has ever promoted suicide, you should leave this forum because you fundamentally misunderstand my work and we will not get along. If you have a problem with psychedelics, if you believe psychedelics are bad, wrong, dangerous, untruthful, and not genuine awakening, you should also leave this forum because we have a fundamental disagreement that I will not be arguing with you about. My work and research is deeply intertwined with psychedelics. If you don't like that, then simply find a community or teacher who does the classic path.
</p>

<p>
	In general, feel free to vent whatever grievances you have with me personally, or with my work. Whatever you don't like or disagree with. Lay all your cards out on the table so that we clear the air. This is necessary to create a non-toxic community going forward which is not constantly at war with itself. The general rule is this: don't waste your time and energy on things you do not align with. Think carefully whether this community aligns with your values, and if it doesn't, just let it go and move on to things that align with you.
</p>

<p>
	Is this a joke?
</p>

<p>
	These people are both clueless.
</p>

<p>
	They have no understanding of my work.
</p>

<p>
	This is the problem with this entire situation. Which is that clueless people will start to opine on things they have no understanding of because "it's a cult" and "I don't feel comfortable" and "It's all ego". Of course in truth both of these people are speaking of ego so deep they don't even know what ego is yet.
</p>

<p>
	So what will happen now is A LOT of profound misunderstanding and projection which causes people to completely get distracted from consciousness work and waking up. And that is precisely how devilry works -- out of ignorance and fear it mislabels true teachings as falsehood, while replacing the true teachings with ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	So this is how the game works. Be ware of that, it will be happening a lot.
</p>

<p>
	There is going to be a culling of this community. My teachings will polarize people, those of you guys who have a problem with my core teachings will have to leave this community and find yourself other communities, because I am not going to tolerate nonsense and projection here. Going forward I expect a very nuanced understanding from you of my teachings, and if I don't see that, you will be asked to leave. Nothing personal, but I have better things to do than argue with ignorance or trolls.
</p>

<p>
	I am not going to sit by and deal with people who have little comprehension of the things I teach and the warnings about this work that I have given out in the past.
</p>

<p>
	If you honestly believe that my work promotes suicide, you should make plans to exit this community because we will not be getting along and I have no interest in teaching such people.
</p>

<p>
	Those of you who understand that my work obviously has never promoted suicide, I appreciate your support.
</p>

<p>
	I should also note, those of you who disagree with my teachings about Love and God-realization will also be asked to leave. You have no business following my teachings.
</p>

<p>
	This thread is being closed, but I will be opening a new thread which will be a discussion about the nature of my teachings and you guys can vent whatever grievances you have with me or my teachings there. There you can also hand in your resignations if you are leaving the forum.
</p>

<p>
	I want to clarity for people who might be reading this anew that measures will be taken to further minimize misunderstanding of the teachings and make things extra clear regarding suicide and other potential dangers and how to avoid them. So don't get the idea that nothing is being done or no feedback is being listened to.
</p>

<p>
	Making the teachings safer and clearer is something I hold as important.
</p>

<p>
	But you also need to understand that they will never be fool-proof and people will ignore warnings even when they are given. The kind of people who are most susceptible to misusing the teachings are precisely those who will tend to skip over warnings.
</p>

<p>
	It's an interesting question. I don't know of a good answer. It's mysterious and infinitely complicated to explain what makes awakening occur in scientific terms. It's not even clear that there is an explicit answer.

			From what I'm gathering it is unclear to mostly everyone here that with this gentleman's death this community has just entered a kind of dangerzone of becoming a hotbed for suicide contagion. That he did it with so much grace, and because timeless nondual truth has little bad to say about suicide, and because this forum as a place of spiritual exploration and communication is full of diverse people contemplating death (as they should be) including a fair number of emotionally unstable folks, we are ripe for a suicide cluster.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you don't know what I'm talking about please google "suicide cluster", "suicide contagion", and "the Werther effect". Sadly, we see this in high-schools all too often. There we can attempt to control the much more manageable environment and offer clinical help to everyone, and still multiple impressionable confused young people take thier lives. There is little chance of halting it here.
		</p>

		<p>
			<br />
			In short folks, this may be the beginning of the end of the forum. The days and weeks to come will tell. It will only take one more, and then there will be a few more. Investigations, lawsuits, all manor of demonization of this work, and a general complete shitshow will follow... Love peace but prepare for war 😞
		</p>

<p>
	Do not fearmonger and spread toxic ideas.
</p>

<p>
	We are here discussing this issue so people can get closure. This thread is not a license for run hog-wild with crazy ideas. Nobody is here to kill themselves and nothing in these teachings is remotely about that.
</p>

<p>
	This idea that anything whatsoever in these teachings is even remotely close to suicide needs to end right now. There is no such confusion in the mind of any reasonable or sane person. Please stop spreading such rumors. Keep in mind that if you guys insist on promoting such ideas about my work, I will stop sharing my teachings with you entirely. And then you will be all on your own.

<p>
	SoonHei was nowhere near the consciousness or development level of The Buddha. If he was awake he would not have jumped off a bridge. An awake person doesn't behave that way and certainly doesn't ask others about it.
</p>

<p>
	He was simply eager to reach liberation via suicide rather than doing the hard work. Why spend 10 years meditating or taking psychedelics when you can just jump off a bridge?
</p>

<p>
	"Die before you die" does not mean: go die. He took it as that.

<p>
	The experience bubble you're in is Absolute Truth. It just has nothing behind it. Like a video game. There is nothing behind the walls, so to speak. It's just a bubble of surfaces that create a perfect illusion of a game world. The world itself does not exist as anything but the appearance of the NOW moment. You can say there is only 1 frame to this movie/game. That frame is Absolute, and you see it now. This frame is God/Universe/Self.

<p>
	You are not in complete God-consciousness, you are in human consciousness.

	It's not stupid at all. It's infinitely genius. Otherwise it could not fool you.

<p>
	All of these are standard nondual truths.
</p>

<p>
	If you cannot handle them, then stop doing spirituality and nonduality. I am not going to babysit you.
</p>

<p>
	The entire point of all spiritual work is to realize that death is imaginary!
</p>

<p>
	"The secret to life is to die before you die -- and find that there is no death." -- Eckhart Tolle
</p>

<p>
	"Nothing that was real ever died, only names, forms, and illusions. The end of illusion – that's all death is." -- Eckhart Tolle
</p>

<p>
	"When you have died this death, you realize that there is no death, and that there is nothing to fear. Only the ego dies." -- Eckhart Tolle
</p>

<p>
	"There is no doubt whatsoever that the universe is the merest illusion." -- Ramana Maharshi
</p>

<p>
	"Death is nothing else but going home to God, the bond of love will be unbroken for all eternity." -- Mother Teresa
</p>

<p>
	"Death is not extinguishing the light; it is only putting out the lamp because the dawn has come." -- Rabindranath Tagore
</p>

<p>
	"Death is a taboo in most societies in the world. But what if we’ve got it completely wrong? What if death was not the catastrophe that it is made out to be but an essential aspect of life, rife with spiritual possibilities for transcendence?" -- Sadhguru
</p>

<p>
	"The only reason why people have such a fear of death is they know nothing beyond the body." -- Sadhguru
</p>

<p>
	"Death is a cosmic joke. If you get the joke, falling on the other side will be wonderful." -- Sadhguru
</p>

<p>
	"Death is a fiction of the unaware. There is only life, life, and life alone, moving from one dimension to another." -- Sadhguru
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	So please, spare me your crocodile tears about my teachings. My teaching are perfectly consistent with 2000 years of mystical and nondual tradition.
</p>

<p>
	Again, your guys' expectations for this forum are way off.
</p>

<p>
	This forum is purely pro-bono work. I offer no guarantees to any member or user of this forum that I will reply or help in any way. I could leave and not post on this forum for 2 months. This is not a clinic, this not therapy, this is not even life coaching. There is zero client relationship here. It's simply a big chat room. No guarantees of help are given. And in fact, no serious help is possible in this format.
</p>

<p>
	Vulnerable people will inevitably come. Suicidal people will inevitably come. Drug addicts will come. Mentally ill people will come. Poor people will come. Criminal people will come. And it is not my job to help any of them any more than it is your job to save every mentally ill poor person you see the sidewalk. There are thousands of people in the world who need serious help. Unfortunately there is not enough time or energy to help them all.
</p>

<p>
	I help those who I can when I feel capable and have some free time. Otherwise it is not my business. I am not here to save the world. And I am not in the business of building out a mental health organization. It is a full-time job just to keep Actualized.org running, even not counting what nonsense goes on on the forum.
</p>

<p>
	Please understand this. No Youtuber or CEO or guru is running around personally saving people. Sadhguru or Eckhart Tolle is not gonna answer your email and talk to you. Sadhguru does not even show up at his seminars. It's just a video recording of him. The amount of time and energy which I have devoted to answering your guys' questions and problems via forum and comments is so outrageously high that you can not even being to calculate it. Nobody in the self-help or spiritual industry or on YT has answered as many questions, in such depth, for free, as I have. Find me one person who has done more.
</p>

<p>
	I spent an hour on the phone last week talking down Connor the madman. Just to get trolled.
</p>

<p>
	You are seriously taking for granted how hard I work for you for free. And if this kind of attitude continues, I will stop commenting and answering questions full stop. It will all be shut down. I have zero desire to play these social games. And I will have zero guilt about it, because I owe you nothing. I could be enjoying a drink on the beach right now, counting my money and smoking some DMT. Interacting with you and helping you has been something I've done for 5 years purely out of passion.

<p>
	I basically expect you to handle your own emotional stuff. I don't have the time to deal with people's emotional ups and downs.
</p>

<p>
	I talk about emotional issues in my videos but I am not going to hold your hand through them. This is totally unfeasible to do and you gotta learn to deal with it yourself anyways. If you need emotional assistance, that's what you hire a therapist for. And don't forget, a therapist charges $200/hr.
</p>

<p>
	If you were playing me $200/hr, then you could expect one-on-one personal help with your emotions.
</p>

<p>
	A doctor charges you $400/hr.
</p>

<p>
	This is an online chatroom.

Or the simpler question, is there anything other than what's right here right now? From how I've understood your teachings as well as my own insights via psychedelics, the answer is perhaps no. But I could see how that knowledge could lead to some twisted places, or at least twisted in the construct of what society deems to be twisted. Or twisted in how the ego hijacks this absolute truth and uses it to reorient life in a sociopathic way. Please let me know if I'm misunderstanding something.

<p>
	Well, you need to become conscious what is absolutely true about the matter.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I have answered the question for myself. I know it's all an illusion. But you have to see that for yourself to believe it.
</p>

<p>
	Beware! To see the total illusion will not be easy to stomach. And it may endanger your material existence.
</p>

<p>
	I reached a point in my consciousness where if I went any deeper, I would probably be dead right now.

<p>
	I didn't say "valuable" I said true.
</p>

<p>
	Value is a relative human matter. My concern is truth.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I never discount the value of permanent awakening -- whatever that even means. I just dispute people who say that temporary awakening is false, unreal, delusional, not valuable, or not part of the awakening process.

<p>
	I was speaking figuratively from a human's POV. God dreams because that's what God is, an infinite dreamer. God has nothing better to do but to play these games.
</p>

<p>
	You guys keep missing something very important about life: life is play! It's a game! It's meant to be playful. Yet you take it so seriously. It's like the idea that God could be playful does not occur to you.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That is not feasible and that will not be happening.
</p>

<p>
	I made a decision a few years ago when I updated the disclaimers to the Forum Guidelines that we are not in the business of suicide prevention or mental healthcare. Nor will we be entering that business.
</p>

<p>
	This forum's purpose is to be a casual place for chit-chat. This forum is a tiny part of my job and it eats up way too much time and energy as it is. I spend more time policing this forum that I do on any other aspect of Actualized.org -- just to keep the devilry in check. This is precisely why I never started a large organization or spiritual commune. The idea was to keep things small and simple and casual.
</p>

<p>
	In the future I may remove every social aspect of Actualized.org entirely. No comments, no forum. Just videos. Because that is the core of what I do. I am not a babysitter. I am a researcher. And we don't have any corporate team here.

	That is the whole problem. It takes a lot of time and energy to sort the truth from the games.

	Our resources on this forum are limited. This is not designed to be a full-service shop. This is suppose to be a casual place for basic Q&A and socialization. We are not equipped to deal with serious mental health issues here.
</p>

<p>
	If I had a way to filtering out mentally unstable people from joining this forum, I would do so. Because it is not my job to work with such people. But such filtering is impossible.

<p>
	He may get suicidal at some point, but he was certainly trolling me. He had no intention to kill himself at all.
</p>

<p>
	One of the reasons I didn't even take SoonHei's case seriously here is because I was sick of getting trolled by Connor just a week ago and I was dealing with all his bullshit.
