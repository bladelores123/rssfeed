	Giant tech companies and social media platforms definitely require serious federal regulation and guidelines.

<p>
	That's not my claim.
</p>

<p>
	My claim is that consciousness can become infinitely conscious, regardless of form or complexity. So what I am talking about is not merely exploring more of the formed world, like some astral realms. I mean pure consciousness itself becoming infinitely more conscious of itself.

<p>
	I totally agree.
</p>

<p>
	But until such regulation exists, Facebook gotta keep their shit together. And even after such regulation, Facebook still gotta keep their shit together.
</p>

<p>
	Regulation is not gonna make Facebook more free, it will make it more restricted. There will be public rules on top of private rules. Just as there are in McDonald's. The government regulates McDonald's to make sure they do not refuse to serve black people simply for being black. And then McDonald's has a bunch of their own private rules on top of that. You're not allowed bring your dog into McDonald's and have it take a shit on the counter.
</p>

<p>
	QAnnon = dog shitting on the counter

</p>

<p>
	If Facebook started banning black people just for being black, then you'd have a good case. But them banning QAnnon is the least they could do to remain non-toxic.

	McDonald's and Starbucks will not hesitate to kick out a customer who walks into their store with a t-shirt that says, "Obama is a monkey".
</p>

<p>
	They are very centralized with 100s of thousands of employees and millions of customers. These stores effectively have ToS. You cannot walk into a McDonald's without shoes and shirt, and many other restrictions exist. They can even force you to wear a face mask!
</p>

<p>
	Imagine what would happen if you walked into a McDonald's with a giant poster of hardcore porn.

<p>
	But there is way more. So much more.
</p>

<p>
	He is not Infinitely Conscious even though he got some permanent shift.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever state he is in, it is a state, and there are much higher states. He simply has not yet accessed them yet.
</p>

<p>
	If he was in the highest state he would not be shooting a video. There would be no universe to shoot a video in.
</p>

<p>
	Of course the present moment is God. But that does not mean you are infinitely conscious of it.
</p>

<p>
	I appreciate his kind words in the intro. He sounds like a sweet guy.
</p>

<p>
	But don't confuse the limits of your present state with the limits of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening will never be a simple binary switch. Nor even a 10-stage switch.

	It's no different than the above example. You are just comfy with the above example so you are not paranoid about it.

	If you work in a company, your boss is the law. He gets to decide the rules of the workplace as long as it is not something illegal.

<p>
	Design your life so that it is so full of meaning that losing a girl does not take anything away. Whether the girl is there or not, your life should be awesome either way.

<p>
	You're playing with words. It is still private in the sense that it is not owned by the state.
</p>

<p>
	Whether or not a company is traded on the stock market does not change the fact that it is owned by private people and not subject to any free speech protections.
</p>

<p>
	Facebook could ban every Republican tomorrow if it decided to. And this would be perfectly fair under capitalism. Facebook could even become a neo-Nazi site overnight with pictures of Hitler on the front page, without any legal problem.

<p>
	Nah... I thought she was average to mediocre.
</p>

<p>
	Look, nobody judges these debates objectively. They merely use the candidate to justify their per-existing self-biases.
</p>

<p>
	If you are stage Orange/Green, Kamala Harris won.
</p>

<p>
	If you are stage Blue/Orange, Mike Pence won.
</p>

<p>
	It's that simple. Spiral stage tells you how a person will vote. The rest is just the ego's rationalizations and excuses.
</p>

<p>
	These debates do nothing but reflect your Spiral stage back as you. Whatever stage you came into the debate with is the stage you will come out of it with. Undecided voters are people so clueless they don't even know what stage they are at or the candidates are at.

<p>
	That is inherent to how capitalism works. Any large company gets to dictate the terms of the use of its products and services.
</p>

<p>
	There are no Free Speech protections for private forums. You are not allowed to go on a kid's forum and start posting porn. This is not a violation of free speech.

<p>
	It is a fear-based survival strategy that you developed as a child. Being secretive allowed you to hide ugly parts of your self from others, and therefore the light of consciousness. It is an ego defense mechanism that creates a sense of you vs other. At some point in your life, revealing too much probably led to you getting wounded. And you act out those wounds to this day.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a lot of courage to air all your inner thoughts and feelings to the world without manipulation or conceit, as you will be challenged by others who will call you out on your biases, selfishness, and bullshit. People will also use this information against you. To manipulate and exploit you.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind withholds information from others in order to gain an advantage in manipulating them.
</p>

<p>
	Actually, it's a very big problem for you. It dominates your entire life in ways that are too scary to even admit to yourself. It makes you feel fundamentally inauthentic, scared, weak, and isolated.
</p>

	Amongst CNN female viewers, sure Kamala won.
</p>

<p>
	The folks who like Pence left the CNN chat back in 2016.

			What about in less developed, stage Blue countries, where people have this idea engraved into their minds that sex until marriage is wrong. There isn't the same cultural context in every country, right?

<p>
	That's different. But even then, the girl will not respect a man who fawns over her. In stage Blue countries women are basically treated like property, and while this may be oppressive and sexist, at least the oppressiveness of it makes the woman respect the man.

<p>
	Kamala and Biden are not taking Trump's monstrous administration to task enough. They are just giving neo-liberal talking points rather than ripping apart the Trump corruption and deeply unpopular and anti-democratic policies.
</p>

<p>
	These kind of debates make the Trump admin seem normal and reasonal because it's hard to rip them apart in this 90 second format where you have to answer some given question.
</p>

<p>
	The disastrous nature of the Trump admin is invisible in these debates. The Trump admin just seems like any other Republican admin. All Pence has to do to win is just seem chill and professional and act like a classic Republican.
</p>

<p>
	Biden's whole campaign is so luke-warm. Like having sex with a fresh corpse.
</p>

<p>
	I don't care about winning an argument with you. Just don't act cnuty on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	For someone so adamantly arguing for left-wing anti-racistic positions, you have the attitude of a right-wing 4chan troll.
</p>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			In regards to this topic, I'm curious whether you would consider the "white supremacist" description of Proud Boys as classified by accredited US intelligence agencies enough to justify the terms' usage in reference to these extremists. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_Boys#cite_note-SPLC-10" rel="external nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proud_Boys#cite_note-SPLC-10</a>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The lines between various right-wing nationalist and racist groups tend to get very blurry.
</p>

<p>
	I basically agree with the Southern Poverty Law Center's initial characterization of the Proud Boys:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			...the Proud Boys are self-described “western chauvinists” who adamantly deny any connection to the racist “alt-right,” insisting they are simply a fraternal group spreading an “anti-political correctness” and “anti-white guilt” agenda.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is how the Proud Boys see themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Of course left-wingers will see them differently.
</p>

<p>
	You have to make a distinction between how people view themselves vs how you view them. You might actually learn something by taking their self-identification and self-description seriously.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The only way to find out is to experiment carefully.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt psychedelics will just automatically cure you. But they might give you insight into your condition and offer some temporary relief and hope.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds like your brain chemistry is not good. You should seriously research how to detox your brain. That is more likely to help you than psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will not cure a toxic and dysfunctional brain chemistry, just like they will not cure a broken leg. You must identify and solve the root cause at its appropriate level. It might be material, or it might be spiritual. Don't try to fix material problems with spirituality, and vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	You can always test psychedelics with very little risk at low doses. A 1/2 gram of mushrooms will not harm anyone.
</p>

Most couples i know were as i am saying. This is maybe USA culture or idk where people do not care about each other before sex because you do not need sex to be attracted to someone. Love might need sex but that is another issue. I know girls that were not comfortable talking to a guy because they liked someone else even before kissing them. It all depends on age tbh, girls before 20 tend to be like this from my observations.

		<p>
			And i am not talking obessing and dreaming about marrying them and gay shit like that. I am saying just geniounly liking them

	"If I work really hard, could I attract this girl..."

<p>
	That is the context of this thread.

<p>
	That attitude must be dropped.

<p>
	This is factually false.
</p>

<p>
	Most guys never get the girl who they obsess over. The more you care about the girl before sex, the less likely you are to sleep with her.
</p>

<p>
	Because a high-value guy would not care. And girls subconsciously know that. So they avoid needy guys like the plague.
</p>

<p>
	A man who fawns over a girl he hasn't slept with is deeply cringe and unattractive. It reveals just how weak the man is.

<p>
	This thread: egos talking past each other, defending their own biases and selfish agendas, as though it were truth.
</p>

<p>
	You are never going to get men and women to drop their reproductive survival biases with logic.
</p>

<p>
	Reproduction is far too important to succumb to logic.

She will never sleep with you due to that.
</p>

<p>
	You have to stop caring about any one girl until she sleeps with you.

<p>
	Zero investment before sex. Zero!

<p>
	Your own logic defeats itself since right now no politician cares about 40 million people in California. You are cool with that. Yet the prospect of not caring about some rednecks in Wyoming offends you.

<p>
	The country should not be run according to the agenda of rednecks in tiny towns and underpopulated states. There is no balance in the development of this country. It is deeply undemocratic and backwards.
</p>

<p>
	That is 80% of America's problem right there. Stop putting rednecks in charge of serious global policy. A moron like Bush lost the country trillions in dumb redneck wars.

	If you ever become infinitely conscious all those questions will melt away into absurdity.

<p>
	You don't need to use cockroaches as an example.
</p>

<p>
	Just go to your local bar/club and hit on some women. See how ruthlessly they shut down your attempts at love. They don't give a damn about your love unless you make them wet.
</p>

<p>
	The only way to get to a woman's heart is through her pants. But of course this is never spoken of in polite company. This is something every guy must learn the hard way. Try to get a woman to love you without getting in her pants first.

			I don't think that was the message of the video. Rather he had genetic mutations which made any exposure to the DMSA/ALA damaging to his health. So maybe a small percentage on here will actually get worse from it due to genetic mutations, even if rigorous use is followed.

<p>
	Firstly, those genetic mutations are very common. Some 25% of the population has them. I have some of them. I don't know which ones he had exactly so I cannot compare mine to his.
</p>

<p>
	Secondly, his case was abnormal. He did some weird stuff like accidentally ingesting a massive amount of ALA. Seems like he was extremely toxic. Most people will not be anywhere near as toxic as him. Although his case is so extreme that I doubt any of you guys here have anything close to that, there are important lessons to be learned here.

			I had to go to the dentist yesterday and I asked whether any of my fillings (drank lots of sugary drinks as a teenager and fucked my teeth up) contained metal. Thankfully only 2 of them do, so I plan on getting these swapped out as soon as possible (Relatively cheap here in the UK). Unfortunately one of them is massive and goes right next to the tooth nerve so I may end up having to have a root canal just to get the metal filling swapped out. It'll be worth it in the long run though, i'm sure. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm going to get a mineral hair test first - would be good to know if I do actually have some level of metal toxicity or not.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Those filling are definitely ruining your cognitive function. Get them out ASAP and do some solid detox.
</p>

<p>
	If you had metal fillings, I wouldn't even take a hair test. Just start doing detox. You will feel it.
</p>

<p>
	But you MUST get the filling removed first.

<title>Isn't Pickup Unconscious?</title>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There is no mystery or contradiction.
</p>

<p>
	Dating and relationships have a material foundation, a survival foundation. If this foundation is ignored or denied, it is like being a hippie who ignores the importance of money in favor of love and peace, but then finds herself homeless and begging for coins, or prostituting herself.
</p>

<p>
	While women love to talk about intimacy and love and relationship, the hard reality is that they will get attracted to guys who have a solid material masculine foundation. Then the love comes. There is no love for weak guys.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a solid shot at love, handle the material/survival layer first. Then you might get some shot at love.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a matter of treating women as objects. There are simply real survival forces at work here and to ignore them will produce bad results for men and women alike.
</p>

<p>
	Love all you want, but also tie your camel. Love cannot replace tying your camel.

<p>
	You're getting lost in dualities.
</p>

<p>
	There is only ONE thing. Here it is.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as not-being.
</p>

<p>
	What you call not-being is just being without form. That does not make being non-existent. It just makes it formless.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness can take on many forms, or it can take no form at all. When it takes no form at all, it is still consciousness.

<p>
	Iraq was definitely a royal mistake and it was obvious to anyone with half a brain even back in the early 2000's how unnecessary the war was.
</p>

<p>
	But you also have to understand something: a senator is part of group think. A senator is not some king. The senate basically fooled itself into the war and not much could be done about that. 9/11 cast a spell on the public and government officials too. The whole country wasn't thinking straight. They were also misled by the Bush admin.
</p>

<p>
	Trump, on the other hand, is reckless in ways which are gratuitous. And don't you dare underestimate his ability to start a war.
</p>

<p>
	Again, Biden is no love-dove. He is a centrist. This is well understood by everyone. But a centrist is better than a demagogue right-winger.
</p>

<p>
	While you're counting deaths, you should count how many people were/will be killed by Trump's horrid environmental policy and deregulation.
</p>

<p>
	The environment alone is all the reason anyone needs to vote Biden.

<p>
	Your paradigm is not different. You're just fooling yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: Why don't you want to wake up with a homeless guy in your bed? According to your paradigm, he is wonderful and attractive. You forget this.
</p>

<p>
	You keep trying to reduce this discussion to physical appearance. But it is not about merely that. It is about the ENTIRE package. A pig is not merely an ugly person. A pig is the ENTIRE package being ugly -- inside too.

	Well, if you want to wake up to a pig by your side every night, no one will stop you <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	High value is not just about sexual appeal or physical appearance. It's the entire value proposition of being in relationship with someone else.
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate this: The only reason you relate with anyone is to get value out of them. What that value is, will vary. It could be sex, companionship, intimacy, someone to talk to, happiness, peace of mind, security, money, love, children, a house, or whatever. All of that is value.
</p>

<p>
	If you wanted no value, you would not relate in the first place. So don't act like you don't want it. Clearly you do. You want a whole bunch of things from that person. Things you don't even consciously know about.
</p>

<p>
	Being in a relationship is not charity work. You are hoping to extract value from it. And as soon as you stop getting the value you expected, you will break it off to find it elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
	This is not true.
</p>

<p>
	And stop framing this as "tricks" to get in a girls panties. Proper game is about becoming a legitimately more attractive and higher value guy. It is not fake. It is real. The confidence and humor developed through pickup is REAL. And it will be respected and appreciated.
</p>

<p>
	Today I am genuinely much more attractive than I used to be. Because of the development work I did. And any woman who sleeps with me will benefit from that. It's not some trick I'm running on her.

You use words like being edgy, but what does edgy actually mean? I do not really see any of my friends being "edgy" and they still get decent girls. Maybe confidence humor and non neediness is all you need these days (good sex too hehe)
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There are many factors that go into being "high value". You don't need to check every box to get a girl. But the more boxes you check the higher value girl you'll be able to attract and keep.
</p>

<p>
	Edgy means saying and acting is slightly outrageous ways. Edginess spikes the woman's emotions and makes her feel alive and adventurous. An edgy guy keeps the woman's emotions stimulated by saying and doing bold and unusual things. This is what creates that classic "bad boy" vibe.
</p>

<p>
	It is not necessary to get a girl. But it can be highly attractive, especially to very hot, very feminine girls.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing in game is ever necessary. You can get a girl by being a total fool just through pure luck. But game is all about maximizing your value and odds.

Great video. It aligned with many things I have experienced with my own health.
</p>

<p>
	If you struggle with concentration problems, brain fog, fatigue, ADD, autism, inability to meditate, crazy monkey mind, etc. -- that's a good sign you might have heavy metal toxicity and you need to get it fixed before attempting any serious consciousness work.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness work is basically impossible without a properly functioning brain. Which is what most gurus never tell you.

<p>
	Find a better girl.
</p>

<p>
	It's not about the cheating potential. That girl is gonna have so many emotional problems.
</p>

<p>
	You don't just walk away from being a prostitute without serious trauma.
</p>

<p>
	Even dating a stripper is a huge red flag. She's gonna be nuts.
</p>

<p>
	Given how many nice girls are out there, why on earth would you settle for an ex-prostitute? It shows you have low value and can't get anything better.
</p>

<p>
	Unless you want to do charity work here. Then by all means, go for it.

<p>
	Yes indeed.
</p>

<p>
	Not dramatic.
</p>

<p>
	It is actually good that women are picky. It encourages the man to be stronger. This gives men an incentive for self-improvement.
</p>

<p>
	The solution for men is not to wish that women were less picky, but to wish oneself to be stronger. And actualize it.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with Incels is that they don't want to transform themselves, so they whine about women being too picky.

		<p>
			From my perspective that's a load of bullshit.

	</div>

<p>
	Like I said, it all depends upon your standards. If you have low standards you can go develop a deep intimate relationship with a crack whore or a hunchback. But who are we kidding? We want the best we can get.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need to go crazy with maximizing sexual value. But your mind IS maximizing it to some degree, whether you know it or not. Feelings of attraction ARE the maximization process at work. It is not a logical process, it is all handled subconsciously by your mind and all you know about it is the feelings of attraction and arousal.
</p>

<p>
	When you feel aroused by another person, that's your mind telling you:
</p>

<p>
	"ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! HIGH SEXUAL VALUE DETECTED! HIGH SEXUAL VALUE DETECTED! CAPITALIZE ON THIS IMMEDIATELY! DO NOT IGNORE!"
</p>

<p>
	And your ego-mind says, "I love that person for who they really are. I'm so loving. This is true love."
</p>

<p>
	It's all self-biased bullshit. A delicious hallucination.
</p>

<p>
	The context of this conversion was sleeping with a Leonardo De Caprio style guy. The female equivalent of which is a supermodel.

<p>
	There is actual win-win, and then there's talk of win-win which actually benefits one party a lot more.
</p>

<p>
	Orange TALKS win-win while bending the other guy over.

There are a lot of "ugly" guys that are with hot women, and no, they aren't necessarily rich or have extraordinary social status. I'm a below average looking guy myself(I would say for sure), yet I have been with very hot women that guys drool over. And I still get interest from a lot of other hot women. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Maybe it also comes with the mindset as I don't really care that much about a women looks. Most important to me is her personality. Which differentiates me from most guys as most guys do care most about a female's looks. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A supermodel is a lot more than just a hot girl. She has fame, status, and millions of dollars.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, I could bang a hot nobody girl. But landing an actual supermodel is a very different matter. She's not gonna date a guy who's not at least a millionaire.
</p>

<p>
	Celebrity dating is a whole nother league, son.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I once went on a date with the 75th top ranked Russian pro tennis star. She was buying BMWs with cash and she was smoking hot. Her body was incredible. But we didn't get along so I never got the chance to sleep with her. But I got real close. If our personalities were more aligned it would have happened.
</p>

<p>
	So yeah, even a guy with my looks can attract hot girls. But it requires game. It ain't gonna happen "naturally".
</p>

			I understand that this is what you wished women would be. Just as, from a female perspective, we would wish men to be looking for love, something deeper etc. You are asking us, women, to try to see this from a male perspective. Yet you are trying to push your experience as a male into the experience of a woman by comments like this.<br />
			<br />
			Please note that comments like this devalue your teaching which I find highly valuable. Reading comments like this show you in a rather unattractive, unintelligent, misogynistic light. <strong>This comment said to a woman in real life, could be considered sexual harassment.

	You can raise your value but only so far. Genetics is a big factor.

<p>
	You ain't ever gonna land Leonardo De Caprio. Just like I will never land a supermodel.

<p>
	Tough titty.
</p>

<p>
	But here's the silver lining: you can find someone near your level of sexual value.
</p>

<p>
	You deal with it by loving who you are regardless of who you are.

<p>
	No one is talking about taking away their voice.
</p>

<p>
	But they should not have a disproportionate voice as they do now.
</p>

<p>
	It is absurd that somehow rural areas are special and need more of a voice. Every person gets one vote. Just because your village is in the middle of nowhere does not entitle you to more voice. Your village matters less than NYC because it has 1000 times fewer people. It's not villages who vote, but people.

<p>
	Right... but now compare that to how many guys who are incel virgins and can't get a girl at all.
</p>

<p>
	To even sleep with 4 guys by your mid 20s is still more than many non-player guys get.
</p>

<p>
	Because it is far easier for a woman get laid than a man. Unless the man has serious game or status.

<p>
	Of course. The reality is, a woman wants strong emotions. And a player gives that to her like no other man can. Which is why women will cheat on their lame boyfriends and husbands with players. A women with get attracted to whatever guy gives her the strongest emotions.
</p>

<p>
	Again, not all players are short-lived. Many of them settle down once they get tired of gaming or find the right girl.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I'm fine with settling down with a girl I really like. I don't need multiple girls as long as I got one good one. But I will be picky in that case.

	Allow me to put your face next to the faces of 10 pedophiles on a pamphlet that I pass around to all of your co-workers at your workplace. In the pamphlet it will say: "Pedophiles are taking over the workplace. All these guys are proven pedophiles, except maybe this guy."

	That's totally up to you. You don't have to sleep with anyone. But if you sleep with Brad Pitt, you should understand the consequences. Brad Pitt is not gonna be loyal to you, sorry. Not unless you are a supermodel. And maybe not even then. Cause he's Brad fucking Pitt.

<title>Isn't Pickup Unconscious?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	You have to understand that if your standards for your sexual partner are very modest, then you should have little problem finding a partner.
</p>

<p>
	This very much hinges on how high your standards are. The higher your standards the more work it takes and the more precarious it is.
</p>

<p>
	If you have high standards it is like trying to balance a knife on its point.
</p>

<p>
	If you are okay with loving any random dude, then that's easy. But also be careful what you wish for. Don't expect him to be all self-actualized for you. Expect him to be a broke, beer-guzzling, sexist, racist fool. Cause that's what a random dude is. And he will probably have anger issues which he will take out on you.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a highly conscious guy who has done a ton of work on himself, what are you willing to give in return?
</p>

<p>
	Being in a long-term relationship is still playing the game. It's only a matter of time.

<p>
	Don't forget that guys with serious game are like 2% of the population.
</p>

<p>
	So if you don't want a player, you can easily avoid them. As long as you can keep your legs closed for them <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	The thing about players is.... you want to open your legs for them real bad. That's what makes them a player.

<p>
	Haha
</p>

<p>
	In practice what most women do is this:
</p>

<p>
	They spend their teens and 20s sleeping around with the hottest, most high-value guys they can find. But since these guys are high value, they tend to be players who leverage their value and won't commit, or are abusive narcissistic assholes. So eventually by the time you hit your 30s you learn your lesson and lower your standards to guys who are less players, but also less attractive and you find some comfortable compromise position with such a guy and you two settle down.
</p>

<p>
	Then you get divorced.
</p>

<p>
	This is a tale as old as mankind itself. Nothing at all surprising about it. This is the game. The game is happening whether you know it or not, whether you want it or not.
</p>

<p>
	The only way out of the game is not be alone and not have sex. If you're going to play the game, you're gonna suffer its inherent limitations. There is no free lunch in the relative world. Sex and relationships have a high cost. Which is why monks and yogis avoid them entirely.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Well, that's beyond the scope of what most men are interested in learning. Most men want to buy advice for how to get more sex, not how to be nice to their girlfriend.
</p>

<p>
	Again, you are expecting men to want to suit your female sexual agenda. But of course men have their own agenda. Why should men work towards your agenda when you don't care about fulfilling their agenda?

<p>
	Haha! And if women would freely open their legs for men when the man wanted it, then men would be much happier with no frustration or burden.
</p>

<p>
	You are not understanding that women and men have conflicting agendas. You expect the man to align to your agenda while you will not do so for him. So here we are stuck in sex wars.
</p>

<p>
	The nature of sexual relations is adversarial. This needs to be understood.

<p>
	Yes, but you will never give your love to a man you don't find attractive.
</p>

<p>
	Neither will a man.
</p>

<p>
	You expect the man to bend over backwards for you. Which is selfish. But when you act selfish, why are you surprised when the man acts selfish too? He's merely mirroring your own selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	Your desire to lock down a high quality man is selfish and that is your agenda. A man is not under any obligation to do that. Maybe he wants that. But maybe he doesn't. And there is noone to say which is right or wrong because this is a purely relative matter.

<p>
	No, that's highly relative. Like I said, you are free to date whoever you want. Date a socially clueless and humorless man. Go date an incel. They got zero game. But they also have zero value.
</p>

<p>
	But of course you will never be attracted to an Incel.
</p>

<p>
	You see, you are trying to steal sexual value. What you really want is this: you want a super attractive high value man who will never leverage his value. Well, good luck. The more value a man has, the more he will leverage it. Likewise, the more value a woman has, the more she will leverage it. A hot women will not hesitate to leverage her value to get the best man she can. Don't act like only men do this leveraging. All hot women do it.
</p>

<p>
	If a woman has enough value, she will be able to leverage it to get the man to be loyal to her. But if she has insufficient value, she won't. And this is what really pisses you off. Because you want to be able to lock down a man with higher value than you, and you see how easily that fails. But you still want it because you are greedy. You want value for free. This is otherwise known as stealing value. Your ego-mind wants to steal sexual value. Well, that doesn't work so well. So stop doing it.

<p>
	I know plenty of players and PUAs who ended up settling for one woman. For most guys, pickup is a phase they go through. They sleep around with a handful of girls until they find one and settle down. Few guys want to be hardcore players for life. This is an exception, not the rule. It's also not very sustainable or even desirable. Dating multiple women gets exhausting and time-consuming.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't pretend like women don't go through a slutty phase. Women sleep around as much if not more than men, but you love to deny it.

			What I find interesting is that the Democrats project their hatred onto Trump but they never ask themselves where they fell down in order to be defeated by someone they have no respect for.  After all, they had the demographic advantage and should have easily won the election.  Trump was able to perceive a discontent that they totally missed and take advantage of it.

<p>
	Democrats self-reflect far more than Republicans.
</p>

<p>
	The only reason Democrats lose is because they have a huge demographic disadvantage with the electoral college and senate system.
</p>

<p>
	Trump exploited peoples' fears and ignorance. Plain and simple. The peoples' true discontent is with the late-stage capitalism system, but they don't understand that, so they are easily exploited by right-wing demagogues.

	If he was truly smart, all of his businesses would not have failed.

	He started out with more money than he now has. Trump started out with an inheritance of $400 million! Adjusted for inflation, that's more than he's currently worth.

</p>

<p>
	RO bottled water is almost always have minerals added back in as the final stage of the process.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing you gotta watch out for with water bottles is the BPA in the plastic. Best to get 5 gallon BPA-free thick jugs.

	Isn't it obvious that of course Trump will downplay any illness he gets?
</p>

<p>
	I mean, this is business as usual for him. He downplays anything that makes him look weak.
</p>

<p>
	He seems mostly functional, which means its not lethal for him, and that was the only part that mattered.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, this recovery is pretty impressive for a guy his age and with the garbage he eats.

<p>
	This is just absurd.
</p>

<p>
	You can easily test the impurities level of your tap water and bottled water with a $15 water meter from Amazon.
</p>

<p>
	Bottled water is about 20 PPM. Tap water is around 300 PPM, depending on where you live.
</p>

<p>
	Tap water is not run through RO filters. Bottled water is. It would be super wasteful to run tap water through and RO filter at the city level. RO filters waste 3-5 gallons of tap water to produce 1 gallon of pure drinking water.

<p>
	Yes, of course it is difficult. Good men are rare just as hot women are rare. Dating is an auction system for reproductive value distribution. If you want a high quality mate, you will have to work on it. It won't come for free. Because high reproductive value is very valuable among humans.
</p>

<p>
	The whole key to getting good results in dating is to raise the value you bring to the negotiating table. The higher the value you bring, the higher the value you'll get. Be ware of trying to steal or leech reproductive value like a parasite by offering little in return.
</p>

<p>
	There will never be an easy solution to this problem because reproduction is a struggle for maximizing value. It was never an activity of unconditional love.
</p>

<p>
	You would not sleep with a homeless person. Why not? Does he not deserve your love?

			I mean I get it a lot of guys are into this thing called pickup game. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But this thought was in my mind about how unhealthy or unconscious this has to be. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Guys view dating as a game. They think of it as a sport. They think of it as hunting, fishing or gaming. I mean these are the labels that can be used to describe this phenomenon. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Then, the question that arises in my mind is, wouldn't I consider the guy a predator? 
		</p>

		<p>
			The one who hunts is considered a predator. 
		</p>

		<p>
			So a pua guy picking up my heart isn't a predator? 
		</p>

		<p>
			I somehow cannot wrap my mind around this whole pickup game and think it's normal or caring.. It looks super predatory to me. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Also my heart is always looking for true love. I don't want a gamer. But a true lover..
		</p>

		<p>
			At a time when I'm trying to raise my spiritual vibration, I should condemn something that I see as low conscious or unhealthy. 
		</p>

		<p>
			I want people to look for real love and cultivate the path to conscious love and not look at love as a means to an end. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Love should be about loving someone and not hunting or grifting someone to snatch what you want 
		</p>

		<p>
			Did that make sense at all or nah?

<p>
	What you have to understand is that that is your agenda based on your needs as a woman.
</p>

<p>
	Guys have a different agenda.
</p>

<p>
	It's just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	You must also consider that for guys to attract girls, the guy has to take the lead and do the work. It doesn't happen passively for guys as it does for many girls. If the guy doesn't go out and hunt, he starves.
</p>

<p>
	Hunting is not predatory in some evil sense here. The guy could be hunting for his dream girlfriend/wife. In fact, that's what most guys probably want. But to get her, they must first learn how to hunt in general. You can't just land your dream girl with one attempt. It takes a lot of work and practice. Hunting is not mutually exclusive to romance and love.
</p>

<p>
	Dating can be done unconsciously or consciously, and many shades in between.
</p>

<p>
	And don't forget, just because a guy doesn't get into pickup does not mean he don't abuse or manipulate women. He certainly will as he will be even more desperate and lacking the hunting skills. A starving limping wolf is more dangerous than a strong well-fed wolf.
</p>

<p>
	Also, pickup is not merely about hunting girls. It's most about transforming oneself into a better man in order to attract and keep higher quality girls. In the end the guy will discover that tricking girls doesn't work, so the guy is forced to grow himself to get the best girls.
</p>

<p>
	None of this makes much sense from the girl's perspective because you are not tasked with the burden of approaching. You should be thankful that you don't have to carry that burden because it's quite heavy.
</p>

<p>
	Do some guys abuse it? Of course!
</p>

<p>
	See, the thing is, women LOVE a strong guy. But they don't love the process which a guy must go through to become strong. Women only want the end-result of the work. Women expect that strength to be effortless, natural, and free, without any work. They don't want to know how the sausage is made.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you should realize that what you call "real love" isn't real love. It is selfishness and survival. Women do not love men unconditionally. You are attracted to strong men who fit your survival needs. You are attracted to weak, needy, humorless men.
</p>

<p>
	Men will love women unconditionally the same day that women love men unconditionally. Which is never. All romantic activities are highly conditional, biased, and selfish.
</p>

<p>
	If you can't experience them, why do you say they are true?
</p>

<p>
	You need to seriously investigate what "true" means at all. What sense does it make to say a thing is true if you don't experience it?

<p>
	Why? Isn't that what's literally true in your experience?
</p>

<p>
	Maybe what's truly absurd is believing in the magical experiences of others which you have in fact never seen?
</p>

<p>
	Why is it absurd to believe in unicorns, but not absurd to believe in "other experiences" when both are equally imaginary? Contemplate this.
</p>

<p>
	You have to seriously question the assumptions culture has programmed you with. Consider the possiblity that you've been brainwashed into believing that other people are real.

	Don't confuse con artistry, manipulation, and exploitation with smarts.
</p>

<p>
	The dude hasn't read a book in his life. He's as ignorant as can be. But he is very good at exploiting people.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Red has a high exploitative intelligence.

<p>
	Just because you successfully rob a bank does not make you smart.

			   Aha! That's a more subtler level of conspiracy theory. See how that criticism might seem like it's not an obvious conspiracy theory, but the underlying defensiveness to the dangers to that psychedelic usage, but these people, while they do have a higher consciousness, still can't catch themselves in the act of being defensive to a specific danger. They get this tunnel vision, and at that point they are now lost in their position.

<p>
	Unless these people are saying I'm part of some secret cabal, I wouldn't call their criticism of me a conspiracy theory. Tons of people will disagree with the stuff I say.
</p>

<p>
	And even calling me a cult leader is not really a conspiracy theory. I get called a cult leader by default by most normies. It's just a standard defense mechanism.

<p>
	I don't propose obessing over it. Many of these are one-time fixes.
</p>

<p>
	Buying a good filtration system for your house is a one-time fix. Easy.
</p>

<p>
	Changing your shampoo, soap, toothpaste, etc. are also easy one-time fixes.
</p>

<p>
	Changing your Teflon pans to stainless steel is a one-time fix.
</p>

<p>
	The only cost here is a bit of time and money.
</p>

<p>
	I will shoot a video in the future about how to detoxify your entire lifestyle.

<p>
	You are still gonna have preferences after enlightenment. If you preferred your wife before, you will probably prefer her afterwards.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment will make you appreciate your wife a lot more. Right now you take her for granted. Afterward you will see her as a goddess.

			Hi , I'm following leo videos for a long time and i remained confused about some spiritual topics.<br />
			My questions are:<br />
			1. On some videos leo talks about consciousness as a quality you have, for example he says "your goal in life is to increase your level of consciousness, or you are not conscious enough, or you have to develop your consciousness and so on.

	Imagine you are sitting in a room with the lights turned up to 1%. The room is light. But its hard to see clearly what's going on. Now imagine the light is cranked up to 1,000,000% and you see everything perfectly. The room is still the exact same light, but now nothing in the room is hidden from view.
</p>

<p>
	Light = consciousness (in this analogy)

	There aren't really 2 people. There is one single field of consciousness which imagines separation. This is almost impossible for the ego-mind to understand because your ego-mind assumes it is real and separate from everything else.

<p>
	Contemplate this question:
</p>

<p>
	Assume God really did exist. How could God ever be sure he was God? Who would he ask? since anyone he asked would be himself. What if God asked himself but then lied to himself? Would that mean God exists but never knows he is God?
</p>

<p>

<p>
	God is not merely a feeling. It is TOTAL OMNISCIENCE of all of reality in one fell swoop. Imagine if you understood in one fell swoop how you designed every hair on your head and every molecule in your parents' bodies.
</p>

<p>
	What you're not appreciating is that the Universe is capable of TOTAL OMNISCIENCE. It can know itself perfectly.

<p>
	New institutions are being built as we speak. Just over the last year companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. have started cracking down on conspiracy theories and toxic right-wing ideologies. And that will only get better going forward. It's far from perfect, but these platforms need time to properly flesh out their moderation teams and guidelines, and to code better AIs.

	Remember, all this chaos is an opportunity for you to rise up to your full Godly potential and to guide mankind towards the light. The devils that lurk around you are there to test your divinity. Will you stand for Love, or succumb to the fear? That is the only game in town.

<p>
	I think the craziness has to play itself out so that people can suffer from the consequences and learn to let go of unworkable and painful ideas.
</p>

<p>
	Humans basically learn through suffering. Excess leads to chaos and suffering, suffering leads to a desire for re-balancing, sanity, and peace. And so it goes in cycles. It's the Hegelian dialectic. We have had 80 years of relative peace since WWII. This peace has made us complacent and spoiled. Now this peace is starting to crack as the old system which got us here will not be enough to get us to the next level, but people are not willing to evolve consciously. So there will be suffering. This is what the Orange >> Green transition looks like. It has begun, but only just, so there is much backlash.

<p>
	Don't poo-poo quality education. All of my work with Actualized.org is grounded in a solid classic education. I wouldn't be here otherwise.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why Trump supporters are mostly white people with no college education. And why they are so prone to toxic conspiracy theories. And why the right-wing is so critical of universities. 2/3rds of Americans have no college education. If 50% of Americans had a college education, Trump would never have gotten elected. Quality classic education is hugely important. It teaches people basic academic rigor which cut down conspiracy thinking a lot.
</p>

<p>
	Universities are somewhat corrupt, but overall they are a net positive force in society. We need more, not less. And also better.

	A Trumpist's definition of truth is inferior to that of the mainstream news. The mainstream news is biased, but at least they have serious journalists with some integrity working for them. The Trump cult just makes up bullshit all day long and treats it as truth.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This can be a clever cop-out by lefties. I think it's too convenient to say that true communism was never attempted. The point which conservatives are right about is this: what if it can't really be attempted because human nature doesn't allow it to even get off the ground? At least not at our current level of development.
</p>

	If every time communism is attempted it goes horribly wrong, that tells us something important about the lack of fit between communism and people. It's sort of like saying, "I've never truly attempted to put on a size 8 shoe" when my foot is size 12. Yet I keep going to the store and buying size 8 shoes, convinced that one day a "true attempt" will finally get it on my foot.
</p>

<p>
	"True attempt" is a very loaded and sneaky notion in this situation.
</p>

But right now in 2020, communism is like giving a 1000 horse power super-car to a 5 year old child and his friends. The child is simply not developed enough to wield such power. And to give such power to a child would be an act of cruelty in my opinion.

<p>
	Yes, I totally agree. That's the biggest lesson we learned from Soviet Russia, China, and Korea.
</p>

<p>
	Socialist ideals are good, but ideals are not enough to make a thing fly. It needs to be practical too. A 1st grader cannot handle algebra. Most people are too selfish to handle socialism. So we need to work on the selfishness part.

	To be fair, this guy did not shit on them. His communication was very balanced and reasonable.

<p>
	But the thing you gotta ask this guy is, "What kind of psychedelics? How much of them did you do? And in what settings?" << That is the key question when a guru starts talking about psychedelics. Ask them that question and you will probably realize that they are utterly inexperienced.

	Sure. That's selfishness and survival and devilry in action. It's been that way since the dawn of civilization. It is important to study and understand how selfishness and survival and devilry work.

	Proper, quality education -- while admittedly a rare thing -- does not make you a slave. It teaches you how to learn and think for yourself and how to have high epistemic standards.

	I admit I was very provocative. Similar to my Libertarianism video. Yeah, it pisses some people off. I should soften up my approach in the future.

			Interestingly, I could rephrase your statement and generate a talking point on the opposite side of the political spectrum: "Yes, any far-left politics in America will functionally be communist in its outcome -- which is what Blue conservatives are reacting to. I totally get that." It is interesting that both sides (left/right) appeal to the slippery slope argument.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	And in a sense that's not wrong. If you listen to the most radical leftists they tend to want some pretty radical socialistic stuff that probably will never work in practice, at least not for hundreds or thousands of years. Yes, both extremes of the political axis are slippery slopes that veer off into delusional ideas of society which will never scale to the mainstream. The center is a pragmatic compromise and tends to scale well.
</p>

<p>
	For example, some far leftists advocate the idea of totally open boarders or actually disbaning the police. This is a silly utopian idea that will never fly. Covid clearly shows the importance of national boarders.
</p>

<p>
	But there is still a difference. The ideals of communism are more conscious than the ideals of white supremacy or nationalism. There is no way that white supremacy will ever work in the future. But communism or socialism might. It's just a question of, To what degree?
</p>

<p>
	White supremacy is an evolutionary dead end. Socialism is not. At least not yet. There is much to study and learn from socialism even if we don't fully go socialist (which, BTW, I don't advocate doing in our lifetime). But there is little value to studying the merits of white supremacy or nationalism other than as an example of what not to do. At least not in developed countries like the USA or Europe. Maybe in the Middle East or Africa nationalism still has some merit, although even that is becoming hard to stomach. The illusion that your nation/culture is the best simply cannot survive in our globalized economy.
</p>

<p>
	How much easier life would be if people simply surrendered the notion that their culture/nation/race is the best. It's such an obviously childish and self-biased position.
