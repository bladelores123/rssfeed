<p>
	Of course, because you are resisting integrating it. Which is why JP appeals to you. He's stuck in the same place. So it's something that's keeping you stuck from growing to your full greatness.
</p>

<p>
	You're not going to be very consciousness unless you understand Green's perspective without judgment. Your hatred of Green is simply your hatred of shadow aspects of yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You are the "Neo-Marxists" that you hate.

<title>Genghis Khan Enlightened?</title>

The Mongols did not just rape and pillage out of the blue. They gave their enemies many opportunities to surrender and join their empire peacefully.
</p>

<p>
	From today's era you can look at Genghis Kahn or Muhammad as a bloodthirsty warlord. But from their own eras, you can look at them as civilizing influences in their regions. As evil as an empire may appear, an empire is more evolved and civilized than a horde of warring tribes (who actually do a lot of random raping and pillaging).
</p>

<p>
	What most people fail to appreciate it what it takes to start a civilization. It doesn't happen through rainbows and butterflies. There was no United Nations back then, it had to be built from scratch.
</p>

<p>
	People like Saddam Hussein are not comic book villains as they are often portrayed. These leaders a rough and brutal because that is the kind of environment they are faced with. You cannot just bring democracy to people. They have to be evolved enough to handle it.
</p>

<p>
	Building a new civilization can be a dirty business.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I have no idea whether the Kahn was actually enlightened. If I had to bet, I would say not.
</p>

<p>
	The issue has never been a denial of post-modernism's or stage Green's limitations. OF COURSE they are limited. Every stage is limited in its own way. The greater mistake is to react against the limitation in a closedminded and egoic way.
</p>

<p>
	Post-modernism has it's limitations, but JP is overreacting to it, blowing it way out of proportion, which just polarizes people and creates a lack understanding.
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to transcend Green by badmouthing Green. Most people who hate post-modernism are stuck in deep Blue/Orange, haven't bothered to actually read it, or think about its lessons. It's just an egoic judgmental reaction out of ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	JP is ensuring that stage Blue and Orange people stay stuck there forever by feeding their demonization of Green.
</p>

<p>
	Classic example of a red herring. Classic Spiral Dynamics trap: failure to fully integrate.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Soviet Communists/Marxists were not modern Green post-modernists. They were Blue ideologues closer to JP's audience than to SJWs.
</p>

<p>
	Oh the irony...
</p>

<title>Too much devotion to mooji</title>

<p>
	One of the downsides to the love-centered approach to nonduality is that it attracts a lot of love-bunnies, who become very devotional to the point of idol worship. Which then creates a sort of stage Green mob mentality, which mirrors stage Blue dogmatism.
</p>

<p>
	I have a friend who joined the Hare Krishnas, and it's this same kind of blind devotion mentality which leads to this kind of spiritual co-dependency. That's the danger of being part of a tight spiritual community. You become dependent on it and you stop thinking for yourself. This can easily lead to abuse and cult-like behavior, even if the guru is a nice person. Precisely what happened with Osho's community.
</p>

<p>
	The guru and his followers both become dependent on each other too much.
</p>

<p>
	A good guru will not let you worship him, keeping a professional distance from his students. Otherwise it becomes incestuous.
</p>

<p>
	I'm guessing Matt Kahn's followers fall into this same kind of trap given his style of teaching.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying anything negative about these gurus, just pointing out some common traps people fall into.
</p>

<p>
	Change is harder than most people expect.
</p>

<p>
	It's not that it doesn't work. It works too effectively. The problem is, you don't really want to change, and you're not addressing the root of your issues. No one has shown you how to actually APPLY self-help advice. So you're lost in theory and improper application.
</p>

<p>
	Victim mentality (which is what your entire post is), can be tricky to overcome. Especially when you are first starting out and you're deep in the hole from a lifetime of dysfunctional living.
</p>

<p>
	The good new is: the advice works and the end-results you can get are way beyond your wildest dreams. The bad news is: it will take lots of work to actualize it.
</p>

<p>
	Redouble your efforts, have hope, and drop your victim mentality.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Getting pissed is part of the process.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Nor did I say that the mind is the only role in healing. I said "most", not all.
</p>

<p>
	You're the one making assumptions.
</p>

<p>
	The way you speak about the "physical" clearly tells me that you believe in physical reality. Otherwise you wouldn't be saying such things. So your level of consciousness is no secret to me.

Not always, but possible. Because your mind controls your immune system.
</p>

<p>
	But this is something you're not going to understand at your current level of consciousness. Because you still believe in a physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	The healing arts are a deep topic which takes years of study and practice to really fathom. And it takes a very open mind. There is a deep mystical component to healing, above and beyond the psychological and "physical" aspects.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff like ADHD is definitely a good candidate for yogic healing. No guarantees, but worth a shot. Obviously the psychological and physical aspects should also be looked after. If you're eating bad food, that could be an important factor. But then again, yoga will purify your mind and chakras so much that you should automatically want to start eating healthier.

<p>

<p>
	Whatever your present state is, it is chemically induced. Ego is just chemicals at work.

</p>

<p>
	P.S. Chemistry itself is also a hallucination.

That looks so much like a deep psychedelic trip.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's an infinite strange loop feeding into itself.
</p>

<p>
	That's sorta what infinity feels like, but without the visuals.

Don't worry about that. Fixing your self-esteem is INNER work. You don't have to do everything you write. Consciousness is being raised by the exercises. The exercises ARE the action in this case.
</p>

<p>
	Stop guilting yourself and allow yourself to just do the exercises without expectations or rules, without needing some kind of outcome.
</p>

<p>
	As your self-esteem & consciousness increases, your action-taking abilities will also increase.
</p>

<p>
	Action != self-esteem

			What is the obsession with 'no purpose'. There can be a purpose of just experiencing? Living in the moment. Making the most of whatever the dream is?

</blockquote>

<p>
	If you do not become conscious that purpose, meaning, and value are created by your ego-mind, you will forever be a slave to self-survival and never reach the deepest levels of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	It is absolutely vital that you guys become conscious of what meaning, purpose, and value really are. Your entire deluded life hinges on those 3 things. The slate needs to be wiped clean. You need to come face-to-face with the fact that life is utterly meaningless. Only then does spirituality begin.
</p>

<p>
	"Living in the moment" or BEING is not a purpose, nor is there any meaning in it.
</p>

<p>
	Sit down and contemplate: "What is meaning? Where does it come from?"
</p>

<p>
	Another exercise you can do every morning is to look around the room and tell yourself, "Every object in this room is totally meaningless and valueless." Focus on each object and tell yourself, "This object meanings nothing." Then move on to the next object. Don't make any excuses or exceptions for any objects. Don't even make an exception for your body, your child, your cat, your dog, your spouse, your wallet, etc. They are all meaningless.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically, you're not going to know. You gotta keep probing it over and over again for years. Your understanding of the topic will keep deepening. A topic like Fear you could contemplate for decades and still find new insights there. Fear is a huge topic. Fear runs your entire life in many subtle ways. Fear also runs humanity and civilization at large.

Everything exists eternally, simultaneously as an infinite singularity.
</p>

<p>
	From the relative perspective, human beings perceive time and linear cause/effect. So in this sense there is evolution. Evolution appears to occur inside the dream.
</p>

<p>
	This explanation makes no logical sense. And yet it is true.

<p>
	Bordem is just something you will have to face down on the journey to enlightenment. The ego is like a shark in water, always moving forward, always looking to the future or past to escape the present moment. Bordem is really just the ego being present and slowly dissolving. It takes a long time to dissolve. Many hundreds of hours.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually, if you can face it for long enough, there should be a breakthrough, and once that happens, Being will become magical and interesting. The ego-mind finds Being boring.
</p>

<p>
	The point of solo retreats is to face the bordem head on. You can't really face it effectively without doing long retreats. Ordinary life has far too many distractions. It takes a few weeks of isolation to really face it.
</p>

<p>
	There's no shortcut. You gotta man up and make the time to face it. It will be very challenging. Especially if you have media addictions.
</p>

		</p>

		<p>
			So if it is unlimited, why does it has to create at all? Why cant it limit itself to unity.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It HAS limited itself to unity. What you're missing is that unity = disunity. True unity contains all possible disunities. In the same way that true freedom contains all possible forms of enslavement. Think about it. There is no true freedom unless you are free to enslave others. (Freedom within human governments is not freedom, but the opposite: limitation). The function of government is to limit freedom. Because true freedom is way too radical and dangerous for the ego to cope with. True freedom means death, which is the last thing you want.
</p>

<p>
	Unity doesn't create, it just is. Creation isn't a process, creation is unity. Creation appears to look like a process from your POV because you are under the illusion that time is real. In fact, time is a concept.
</p>

<p>
	Why does God allow evil? Because God is all-allowing. God allows EVERYTHING. God cannot discriminate. Which literally means that God cannot see evil. To God, evil cannot exist, other than as delusion. Because in TRUTH, nothing is evil. Evil can only exist as falsehood. For God to create evil, it has to lie to itself that evil exists. And that's how evil is born, as an illusion within the eyes of God incarnated as a human being. Only human beings are deluded enough to see evil in the world. God is too smart to see evil, so it has to make itself stupid (born as a human) to experience evil. A human is just a retarded version of God. Why would God retard itself? Because God is unlimited, it must allow every possible thing, including every possible retardation of itself, from a microbe to an ant to a monkey to a human.
</p>

<p>
	But Leo, I don't like being retarded! Well, that's cause you're a selfish retard. If you were really smart, you'd see retardation is necessary to complete the whole. There cannot be infinity without retardation.
</p>

		<p>
			Ok, for what? For what do we need exactly this is one variation of infinity (and by this I mean your exact life) ? Why the fuck would infinite consciousness not stay in unity for ever?
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>What I want to say is that I do not see the reason why unity would have ever created duality? </strong>
		</p>

		<p>
			Just because its infinite and thus has to create everything? Why cant it be infinite in its unity?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's very simple. What you're failing to comprehend (because you are stuck in the duality paradigm) is that nonduality and duality are IDENTICAL!
</p>

<p>
	There exists only one thing: Infinity. That's where you find yourself sitting right now. Smack in the middle of this infinity.
</p>

<p>
	This infinity includes nothing, and everything simultaneously.
</p>

<p>
	God doesn't really "create" anything. Creation is not something that occurs through time. Creation is NOT a process. Creation is. Like a giant static singularity. God is all things all the time. God cannot help being all things because that's what limitlessness means. To be unlimited is to be EVERYTHING all at once.
</p>

<p>
	Duality was never really created. It was always just an aspect of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	ONENESS is so ONE that it contains all possible divisions of itself. In the same way that pure white light contains all the colors of rainbow inside itself. White light doesn't create red, blue, green, yellow, etc. White light is IDENTICAL to red, blue, green, yellow, etc.
</p>

<p>
	A carton of eggs contains: 0 eggs, 1 egg, 2 eggs, 3 eggs, 4 eggs, 5 eggs, 6 eggs, 7 eggs, 8 eggs, 9 eggs, 10 eggs, 11 eggs, and 12 eggs -- ALL AT THE SAME TIME! A carton of eggs does not create 3 eggs. It is BEING 3 eggs already! That's what carton means. Is it true that there are 3 eggs in a full carton of eggs? Yes!
</p>

<p>
	Now imagine an infinite carton of eggs.
</p>

<p>
	You are one of those eggs, and also the whole carton.

And If not, how can you be sure not to doubt your experience?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's the opposite. It's like waking up from being asleep. Asleep is what you are now. You are asleep to the fact that many-ness is identical to ONENESS. You're failing to notice the ONENESS, because you believe you're alive and separate from other things.
</p>

<p>
	According to duality, there is a difference between duality and nonduality. But according to nonduality, there isn't.

</p>

<p>
	Success != consciousness
</p>

<p>
	A con artist can be very successful on the surface for short periods of time. That's self-survival 101. Evil 101.
</p>

<p>
	And you should further distinguish showmanship and displays of success vs true success.
</p>

<p>
	Photo opp != success

<p>
	1) There is no how. All knowledge is nontrival and delusion-prone.
</p>

<p>
	2) Absolute Truth is not an experience or knowledge. It is DIRECT. You are it. You will only understand that with an enlightenment experience. An enlightenment experience is not really "an experience" and it is not knowledge. It's not anything you've ever encountered in your life yet. It's a 3rd type of thing which is totally unknown to you as being possible. Hence it comes as a shocking surprise.
</p>

<p>
	3) The Absolute is self-knowing and self-validating because it is Absolute. It is true under all circumstances. It's not something you need to trust. It is raw pure TRUTH! How that's possible cannot be known to you until you awaken.
</p>

You speak of things of which you have not yet become conscious.
</p>

<p>
	Don't bring JP into discussions of nonduality please. He's no clue what nonduality really entails, nor does anyone who takes him seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than pushing your ideology, why not sit down and become conscious of what meaning really is?
</p>

<p>
	Look closely. You have no idea what it is yet.

<p>
	A ruler is also an invention.
</p>

<p>
	Einstein taught you this 100 years ago. The length of a ruler changes depending on its velocity relative to the observer.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "a ruler" in any objective sense.

</p>

<p>
	The whole process is relative. It's all about where you are now and where you need to go next. You have insights and then you outgrow them, have some more, outgrow them, and so on.
</p>

<p>
	You're not gonna go from newbie to Zen master in one giant leap. It's gonna be a long, slow, grueling process of having dozens and hundreds of various insights.
</p>

<p>
	You're going mature every day a little bit. Some days a lot. Some days, you will regress.

	Consciousness is unlimited, so it creates every possible thing, the same way that a gas will expand to occupy every corner of its container. But consciousness has no container, so it just keeps creating forever.

Pure intelligence. As Anaxagoras described it. This is NOT the same thing as merely feeling the miraculousness of the present moment.
</p>

<p>
	Apparently you ain't done that yet.
</p>

<p>
	Like I keep saying, there are many facets and degrees of penetration to this work. But nobody seems to take me seriously when I say that. You guys keep thinking I'm deluded or something. But I warned you guys a long time ago that there is more complexity to this work than most people realize.
</p>

<p>
	If you are content with being in the present moment, that's all well and good. But you don't know what intelligence is. That would be a cool thing to discover someday, if you're the metaphysically curious sort. Don't you wanna know how you engineered yourself?
</p>

<p>
	These kinds of threads become very toxic very fast on this forum.
</p>

<p>
	Sorry
</p>

<p>
	All politics is self-agenda in action. Regardless of whatever your positions are. So there cannot really be any truthful discussion of politics, because the goal of politics is to rig the game to meet your ego's needs.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you think your politics is going to save the whole world << that's your ego meeting its perceived needs. It's survival through and through. Which is why political discussion quickly devolves into shit-slinging contests.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be very careful when mixing politics and personal development.
</p>

<p>
	Depends on how you use it.
</p>

<p>
	All theory comes with the danger of misuse and mental masturbation.
</p>

<p>
	Most of my videos are meant to be INSPIRATIONAL. Not technical how-to's. You get inspired by the theory, which then makes you want to work hard to actualize it.

	If you were not limited to sitting down, you'd be standing up. You're overlooking the obvious: you <strong><u>ARE</u></strong> limited in that case. Your body is very much limited. Which is why it occupies a very specific position and location within the universe. Of all the possible ways you could be located in the universe, you are located EXACTLY one way -- the way you find yourself being right now!
</p>

<p>
	Ponder the following: Why would reality be one way vs another way? What would enforce or obligate reality to be any particular way rather than its opposite? And what would enforce that enforcement? And what would enforce that enforcement of enforcement? And so on....
</p>

<p>
	You see?

</p>

<p>
	Your idea of Infinity is not Infinity, it is finity. See?
</p>

<p>
	The map is not the territory.
</p>

<p>
	Anything you think about Infinity is automatically wrong. Any logic you apply to Infinity will crumble and not make sense.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity cannot be held in the mind. But it is definitely Infinitely Intelligent.

<p>
	The ocean is still there to be explored.

But it's not the kind of "questioning" you're talking about. The "questioning" you're doing right now is a sort of fear-based skepticism. That's not true questioning. True questioning is totally open and curious. Fear of being wrong shouldn't be on your mind. It's the ego-mind which fears being wrong.
</p>

<p>
	The psychedelic will reveal truth to you in an organic, effortless manner. You can doubt it afterwards if you like. If you try to apply fear-based skepticism in the middle of the trip, you are not surrendering, and you will likely have a bad trip. Psychedelics punish arrogance. And fear-based skepticism -- despite how it might seem to you -- is arrogance.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like your aversion to psychedelics is fear-based.
</p>

<p>
	For me, stopping is not a problem or an issue. I have no attachment to psychedelics. I use them like a tool, in moderation.
</p>

It needs to be directly experienced.
</p>

<p>
	Meditation, yoga, self-inquiry, psychedelics. That's what you need.
</p>

<p>
	The present moment you are experiencing right now is a tiny fragment of an Absolute Infinite singularity, which includes all things that could ever be, and at the same time, none of it ever happened or even exists.
</p>

<p>
	What you are experiencing right now, is Absolutely Nothing. But it sure doesn't feel that way, does it? Because you have created a duality between something and nothing, when in fact the two are ONE.
</p>

<p>
	You are everything that could ever possibly be, and you are nothing. This is beyond the mind's ability to understand. It requires a radical shift in consciousness.
</p>

<title>All mathematics destroyed (1 + 1 = 1)</title>

<p>
	Of course the whole trick to mathematics is how to define the units, and every definition is permissible.
</p>

<p>
	You can say a carton of eggs is 1, or a dozen, a trillion trillion atoms.
</p>

<p>
	Mathematics is a projection of the mind. It's about where your mind chooses to draw the boundaries.
</p>

<p>
	Also, interestingly: 1 infinity - 1 infinity = 1 infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity contains an infinite number of infinities inside it! <img alt=":o" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/ohmy@2x.png 2x" title=":o" width="20" />

But 3-4 rounds is really nothing. I recommend you do 12-24 rounds at least. The point of yoga is to move that prana up your spine. Open those chakras. Then you can meditate.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise, you're not really doing yoga, you're meditating. In which case just meditate and forget about yoga.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga is not for everyone. For some people, meditation will be a better path. Find what works for you.

		<p>
			Also how can we know for sure that insights we have while tripping are true? They may feel true, but when it’s something as powerful as 5-meo; is it not possible that it might be able to create things that are true, or feel true? After all, how can we really know what a substance is capable of doing, and what’s it’s not capable of doing?

<p>
	Try it and see. That's the only way you know anything at all.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot know ahead of time how the Absolute is Absolute. But it's Absolute, and you'll know it immediately once you're in it. How is that possible? This cannot be explained to you because you are asleep.
</p>

<p>
	Of course it's possible to misinterpret psychedelic trips. Very possible. The tendency for self-deception is ALWAYS at work in everything you do. Self-deception is even possible after enlightenment. There is no escaping the possibility of self-deception, ever, so long as you have a mind.
</p>

<p>
	The question you should be more concerned about is: "What if my current thinking is self-deception? What if I'm having all these doubts about this path because I'm asleep? What if I'm questioning psychedelics because I'm really just too afraid and lazy to try them?"

Whereas nonduality is ACTUAL.
</p>

<p>
	Solipsism also don't acknowledge the possibility of awakening
</p>

<p>
	And solipsism doesn't acknowledge other facets of enlightenment like that you are God, Absolute Infinity, infinite intelligence, transcendence of death, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And solipsism doesn't acknowledge no-self. A solipsist is still full of ego.
</p>

<p>
	Solipsism is still stuck at the level of human perception. It just says, "This bubble of human perception is the only truth. Others don't exist."
</p>

<p>
	With nonduality, it's more like: "Others exist as illusions that I created as God. The illusory world is infinite."
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is going to feel very different than solipsism from a first-person POV. Although the ego-mind may think they are the same.

This understanding is both intellectual and at the emotional/body level. Less-so at the body level.
</p>

<p>
	As far as rewiring my mind habits, not so much. I find psychedelics are not too effective at that. They are more effective at giving you radical glimpses which shock your mind into seeing the world from a radically new perspective. But your old mind-habits largely remain unchanged. Of course that may vary from person to person, and if you do a lot trips, there may be some significant rewiring.
</p>

<p>
	Experiencing Absolute Infinity is a life-changing event. It was the most important event in my life. Your life cannot be the same afterwards. Although most of your habits will remain unchanged and your level of consciousness will drop back down to baseline. You will be back asleep, but you will at least know what true awakening looks like.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to significantly rewire your brain with psychedelics, I think it's possible, but will require 50-100+ trips spread out over a long time.
</p>

<p>
	I'm up to about 12 5-MeO trips total. If I did 30 trips back to back, that would produce some serious change. The trouble is, it's so jarring it would probably put your entire life on hold as you have to deal with all the emotional baggage, fear, depression, and resistance that rises. It would be brutal on your ego, and you probably couldn't take it and have a big ego backlash. It all depends on how ready you are to awaken.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	It just requires exceptional talent and enormous amounts of grinding work. We're talking 10,000+ hours of it, done in large consecutive chunks.
</p>

<p>
	Read Om Swami's accounts of how hard he meditates, for example. It's an insane, super-human feat he does. It's just not realistic for most people. This is the kind of stuff only monks have time to do. This is like Olympic level meditation.
</p>

<p>
	The reason I talk about psychedelics is because they offer ordinary people a glimpse of what a 40 year enlightened master or full-time monk experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you could take a pill and experience what it is like to play golf at Tiger Wood's level, or to play the piano at Mozart's level, or play chess at Gary Kasparov's level. That would be awesome, and highly useful to normal people.
</p>

<p>
	Well, psychedelics are just that.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I've had insights on 5-MeO that Shinzen Young has yet to have, and he's like 80 years old and has been teaching this stuff for 50 years. I can see that Shinzen is not fully enlightened. This would be totally impossible for me to see without 5-MeO. I've talked to students of his who have been practicing with him for 10-15 years, and they are still not enlightened, or even close.
</p>

<p>
	(BTW, nothing against Shinzen. I think he's a great teacher.)
</p>

<p>
	It's almost impossible to convey how deep the rabbit hole goes.

<p>
	Yup
</p>

<p>
	"Matter" is a precipitate of Infinite Mind.

<title>Fear of the truth of Solipsism</title>

<p>
	Nonduality is NOT solipsism.
</p>

<p>
	But the ego-mind may not see it that way at first.
</p>

<p>
	It is true that you are the only thing in existence. You created every human being that exists. Of course the trick is, we're talking about the universal YOU, not the personal you.
</p>

<p>
	It's very simple logic: if nonduality is true, there is no division between anything. There is certainly no division between you/other. You are your own mother. You created Actualized.org to help you awaken. You even wrote this sentence. You are God in every literal sense.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is of course afraid of this. And it may be a shock to the system when you first start to realize how radical nonduality really it. It may feel like madness. Of course it's not madness. It's TRUTH. But TRUTH is a radical thing. It requires a very deep surrender.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, once you fully surrender, it will be fine. Great even.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality, at the highest degrees of it, is extremely radical. It will shock and terrify the ego-mind. That is the #1 obstacle which keeps people unenlightened. You have to surrender to the radicalness of it. You have to surrender to the madness. It's not really madness. But it will appear to be madness relative to the normie paradigm you are used to.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightened people are basically insane by all conventional standards. They just happen to be insane in a functional way. And they don't frame it that way because it would scare off newbies.
</p>

<p>
	The lite degrees of nonduality can feel pleasant and nice.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest degrees of nonduality can feel downright terrifying and depressing.
</p>

<p>
	And the final stage is peace and wonder.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't that the whole point?
</p>

<p>
	Of course don't overdo it. Ramp it up gradually over weeks and months.
</p>

<p>
	But 6 pranayama is really nothing. People do up to 72 or even 100+ pranayamas a day.
</p>

<p>
	Most of you will need to do 10,000s of pranayamas to start seeing serious results. Some will need less, depending on your spiritual attunement.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If you become really conscious, you will not need my teachings. But it will probably take you much longer to reach that stage than you think.
</p>

<p>
	Hell, you can walk this entire path all by yourself, without reading a single book or watching a single video. But if you were the kind of person who was going to do that, you wouldn't be here, would you?

<title>What if spiral dynamics goes full circle?</title>

<p>
	Coral does spiral back over Beige (not Red). But the difference between Coral and Beige is massive.
</p>

<p>
	It's not full-circle, it's full-spiral <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I don't know much about Coral. Don't worry about it. You have a long way to go.
</p>

But it will end up longer than that pretty soon because you need to aim for 36x Pranayamas + 20 mins of breath of fire + 10 mins at least of concentration.
</p>

<p>
	It will start to grow upwards of 90 mins in the end. But do it gradually, over time. 90 mins is tough.

<title>If self-deception is for survival...</title>

You'd exist as Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	An enlightened person has ended survival, in a sense. But his body is still surviving.
</p>

<p>
	- - - - - -
</p>

<p>
	That depression causes you to come crawling back to your ex for some hot makeup sex, or take charge of your life and find a new partner, or to swear off all relationships for good so you can never again get hurt.
</p>

<p>
	Your need in this case is: companionship / sex / love / comfort / safety / reproduction
</p>

<p>
	And your depression is trying to ensure you keep that need met.
