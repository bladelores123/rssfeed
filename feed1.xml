	Soviet Union was Red/Blue not Green.

<p>
	His conflation of Soviet Union with America and socialism is abysmally wrong-headed.
</p>

<p>
	The most advanced, developed, happiest, and healthiest countries in the world are: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Netherlands, etc. They are stage Green, verging on Yellow. Yes, they pay more taxes so that society is more even and fair for average people. The metric of success is not tax rate but average happiness, education, health, and success levels.

	His wisdom is not so practical when it polarizes young white males into demonizing stage Green, collectivism, post-modernism, environmentalism, and women's/minority rights. His audience has not integrated these things at all. Nor has JP.

	Meanwhile American society is drowning in pathological Orange to the point of global collapse.

You could teach yourself to stop creating it. Then you would enter nirvana. But you'd also be dead.

<p>
	Nirvana is the realization that negativity does not exist.

<p>
	Mars colonies don't materialize from thin air. It takes 4 billion years of murder to create a Mars colony. And on that Mars colony you will have people who will use force to survive. Not to mention your killing of plants (which of course you conveniently don't even consider as initiation of force). But you are literally enslaving plants and eating them. Did you ask the plant for permission to eat it? Is the plant being eaten voluntarily?
</p>

<p>
	Do you see how ridiculously self-biased your whole worldview is? You are so selfish you don't even see your actions as selfishness!

<p>
	Without initiation of force against others life could not exist.

<p>
	Survival is force, manipulation, theft, killing, and deception.

<p>
	You are lying to yourself that you do not initiate force. See how you pretend to be an angel while actually being a devil?
</p>

<p>
	As soon as your survival is threatened, you will initiate force and then you will justify it to yourself as not an initiation of force. Because in your egoic delusion you are an angel and must maintain that heroic self-image. By definition, anything you say, do, or think is "good" in your own mind because all you know and care about is your survival. All of your high ideals are just part of your survival strategy. They are survival through deception.

<p>
	No! You fundamentally misunderstand how ego works.
</p>

<p>
	Ego defines everything relative to itself. "Self-defense" and "good" just mean: whatever is good FOR ME -- whatever I believe.

	People do not agree on anything. That's the whole problem.

<p>
	People are dishonest and lying ALL THE TIME! Most people are full of shit, even with themselves. All of those libertarians are full of shit. Therein lies the problem. They don't realize their own bullshit. All of their high ideals are just fantasies of the ego which is acting noble when in fact it is a selfish devil. A libertarian has no idea of how the ego is running the entire show.
</p>

<p>
	A libertarian is just a devil in sheep's clothing. What's worse, he's so deluded he's managed to convince himself he's an angel. At least a warlord is honest with himself that he's a devil.

	Lol, to the ego, there is no difference between defense and offense. Your anarcho-communist commune will attack a neighboring commune and slit all their throats in the name of "self defense". Of course they will rationalize it to themselves as being fully consistent with their lofty non-aggression principle, in exactly the same way that the US rationalized the invasion of Iraq as "liberation" and self-defense against evil-doers.
</p>

<p>
	What you are describing is exactly what governments do now. Only you're describing a version of it from 10,000 years ago. It's like you want to roll social evolution back by 10,000 years, thinking it will hold. But you can't wish nuclear weapons away.

There are left and ring wing versions of libertarianism.
</p>

<p>
	There are even anarcho-communists:

<p>
	The problem is that doesn't work at scales of tens of millions of people. Yes, a handful of farmers can get together and build a local farm road. But they can't build an interstate highway or stop giant corporations from pouring toxic waste into a lake or running nationwide high speed 5G wireless phone networks.
</p>

<p>
	Modern governments with 100+ million people require massive infrastructure to maintain. You can't get that by living in tent villages and bartering homegrown lettuce with your hippie neighbors.
</p>

<p>
	Warlords will certainly enslave your hippie commune if there is no strong federal government to protect it. But even more realistically your hippie commune you will self-collapse from greed and sexual and other scandals. A sociopathic narcissist will hijack your commune and turn it into a criminal cult.

What are you trying to know or understanding?
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		What am I?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is reality?
	</li>
	<li>
		Why is there something rather than nothing?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is God?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is consciousness?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is love?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is another?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is the mind?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is ego?
	</li>
	<li>
		How do I end suffering?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	You want to be clear about what insight you want.
</p>

<p>
	What the fuck do you want??
</p>

<p>
	If you want nothing then be clear about that and just sit in peace without effort (the do nothing technique).
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot too.

<p>
	No, meditation is going to surface emotional "stuff". It only becomes calm after years and years of heavy practice.
</p>

<p>
	For a Zen monk with 20 years of daily practice, yes, it's now calm. But that ain't you.
</p>

<p>
	Although sitting still should still be doable for you. Not sure why your legs need to be flailing around.

</p>

<p>
	Nothing wrong with getting a Green job. Yellow is built on top of Orange & Green. You can't just start a Yellow biz in mid-air. You'd probably first need to gain experience running a business at Orange. That is hard as it is. A Yellow biz is not easy to achieve. Every higher stage gets harder and harder. It's not an accident that Yellow and Turquoise businesses are very rare. It takes exceptional skill to create and sustain them.
</p>

<p>
	I couldn't start Actualized.org until I first gained proficiency in Orange enough to pay my bills and attract viewers. Without Orange Actualized.org would not exist.

<p>
	That's really my only criticism of the Majority Report. As Green, they are too adversarial against Orange & Blue, thus deepening the polarization.
</p>

<p>
	But that's just how Green is. It ain't yet Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	I thought about sharing Spiral Dynamics with them, but they would probably demonize me for it. Green does not want to give up its hatred of Orange.

Maybe you should build the thing you seek rather than expecting it to fall in your lap.
</p>

<p>
	Create a stage Yellow company. Found a stage Yellow academic community. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you don't necessarily need a entire Yellow community to start. Start by finding 1 solid Yellow colleague/friend. And build up from there. This is not like having Facebook friends. Less is more.
</p>

<p>
	Seminars, workshops, and conferences would be a great place to find Yellow people. Find a few Yellow workshops and go there every year just to network and make friends. Go to workshops that stage Yellow people would attend. Like systems thinking or ecology or those that tackle worldwide systemic problems.
</p>

<p>
	A psychedelics conference would a good place. I've posted psychedelic workshops on my blog before.
</p>

<p>
	Hell, Don Beck even holds a Spiral Dynamics conference every year!

<p>
	That's because the higher your development the easier it is to awaken because the higher your perspective-taking ability is and the more openminded you are.
</p>

<p>
	But be careful with your generalizations. All of these people are different and they lived long lives which involved lots of unseen development work. You probably cannot imagine how much work such people did on themselves. We're talking 10s of thousands of hours of work and study.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse humility and simplicity of teaching with lack of work. Just the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	Most of the people on the Turquoise list are world-class masters.

<p>
	If you want to get a fair sense of Green politics I suggest you check out the YouTube channel, Majority Report. They are the epitome of Green, but notice that they are not some kooky student activist with utopian ideas. Their political analysis is sharp, nuanced, pragmatic, and intelligent -- despite their biases. They are smart socialists and if you listen to them long enough you might become a socialist yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, they are not Yellow. So don't expect them to be as wise as Yellow or the stuff I share on Actualized. Nor am I suggesting you should become a socialist.
</p>

<p>
	Just make sure you are getting a fair assessment of each stage. Look for the best examples of each stage, not the worst. You can find monstrous and kooky people at each stage if you look hard enough. For example, I could smear all of stage Orange as being like Trump. But that would be very unfair to Orange. He is like the worst of the worst of Orange.
</p>

<p>
	For another great example of Green see Bernie Sanders. He's not some kook. He's got a very sensible agenda and his value system is very advanced. Good luck finding a politician with a more advanced value system and higher integrity.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, how to start a business is a HUGE topic & skill set all on its own. There are thousands of books, courses, videos, seminars, workshops, and trainings available on this topic.
</p>

<p>
	It would be relatively easy to set up a web programming business where you get clients to pay you so that your small team of programmers can code their website or app. There is a near endless demand for high quality web programming teams. If you were smart you could manage such a team remotely. You could have a 100% virtual programming business by hiring good programmers from overseas like in Eastern Europe or India.
</p>

<p>
	Of course all of this requires business & project management skills. But that's not too hard to learn if you are serious. You could easily make 6 figures like this.
</p>

<p>
	And that's just one idea.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes. The intention of such Green people is fairness for oppressed minorities. Which is a fairly evolved set of values. It is much more evolved than those who cry "white genocide" or complain about the war on Christmas or white males.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that people like JP and the alt-right media have created a demonized stereotype out of these post-modernist Marxist types. They do not really exist. JP and his ilk have taken like 1% of the most extreme Green folks and smeared all of Green with that. They've created a straw man out of Green and of course the straw man is easy to knock down. But Green is not that straw man. There are many very serious, sane, sober, lovely Green people. And they are higher than JP and his ilk. Radical feminist activists in universities DO NOT represent the majority of stage Green.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if I smeared all of stage Orange as greedy capitalist pigs who exploit children in sweatshops and kill polar bears for fun. I could create a whole YT channel about that and get millions of followers to agree with my selective outrage. I could create 100's of videos of children in sweatshops, big oil spills, and corporate corruption. That's analogous to what JP and the alt-right media is doing to Green. The reality is much more nuanced.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest tragedy is that JP and his ilk are missing several key lessons from post-modernism. Regardless of any excesses or faults, post-modernism made crucial intellectual discoveries which are being denied by JP. Like the relativity of all cultures, all value systems, and the socially constructed nature of all categories and paradigms. This is very important to understand into order to create a peaceful and well-functioning world. You are not a serious intellectual if you think that the white race's value system or the capitalist value system is objectively superior to others. The acknowledgment of relativity is vital to the development of higher levels of morality.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Orange sorely lacks the understanding of relativity. It also fails to appreciate the importance of collectivism -- since we do live in a community. We are not individuals who get to do whatever we please.
</p>

<p>
	Is it an accident that JP is a climate change denier? He's even in denial that he's in denial! This is not going to cut it in the future. We need a lot more ecological awareness if we want to thrive.
</p>

It will tell itself it knows more than it does. You can count on this.
</p>

<p>
	But if your intent for truth is genuine and you are forcing yourself to self-reflect and question all of your beliefs, that should ultimately lead you closer and closer to the truth. You have to be brutally honest with yourself or else you will settle for wishful and self-biased delusions.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot too. On psychedelics you clearly see what genuine insight feels like. It is undeniable and transcends all belief, ideology, or speculation.
</p>

<p>
	It also helps to have great teachers and great books to keep your egotistical fantasies in check.

So all you got to do is build up more of those skills and build an awesome portfolio which showcases your skills.
</p>

<p>
	While you are job-hunting, spend the rest of your time building your audio engineering skills & portfolio. If you end up working at Walmart, keep building your audio engineering skills on the evenings and weekends. After a few years of that you'll get your desired job.
</p>

<p>
	If you can afford to take 6 to 12 months off to focus solely on building your skills, that would be ideal. In 12 months of full-time skill-building you should be a very solid entry-level audio engineer candidate.
</p>

<p>
	That's how I got my first job as a video game designer.
</p>

<p>
	When you are applying for jobs, you should be applying all around the country, not just in your city.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	But it requires that you offer value to the employer rather than being a leech.
</p>

<p>
	What job do you want? What skills do you have? Are you showcasing your skills well with a portfolio?
</p>

<p>
	These days training yourself and building skills is easier than ever. You must train yourself and then show evidence to your employer of your skills and your willingness to learn further on the job.
</p>

<p>
	Building a great portfolio is a MUST as far as I'm concerned. With a great portfolio you will eliminate all your competition.
</p>

<p>
	People being more experienced than you is not a significant factor because those people also demand a higher salary. Employers are always looking for people with low experience because they need people to do grunt work and those who will work for lower salaries.
</p>

<p>
	You are not competing with people with 5-10 years of experience. You are competing with people who have 1-2 years of experience, which you can provide for yourself. "Experience" does not have to mean that you were a salaried employee during that time. Experience could mean: you working on a project in your mother's basement.
</p>

So nothing surprising about that.

	Well, the devil is in the details of course. You'd have to brainstorm some solutions, informed by your understanding of Spiral Dynamics.

</p>

<p>
	Generally, you cannot change a thing which doesn't want to change. So you could work with your girlfriend so long as she was open to growing and learning about Spiral Dynamics. Changing an Orange workplace is probably a no-go. You'd be better off finding a Green workplace or starting your own.

	You can be enlightened and still a racist. Because your level of Spiral development might be ethnocentric Blue.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is not development. And development is not awakening.

<title>Spiral dynamics research</title>

<description><![CDATA[

<p>
	The research is not called "spiral dynamics" per se. What we're talking about here is the entire field of Development Psychology which includes hundreds of researchers.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber does a good job of integrating and mentioning many of the researchers.
</p>

<p>
	Here are but a few names:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Jane Lovinger
	</li>
	<li>
		Piaget
	</li>
	<li>
		Kurt Fischer
	</li>
	<li>
		Robert Kegan
	</li>
	<li>
		Susanne Cook-Greuter
	</li>
	<li>
		Kohlberg
	</li>
	<li>
		Gilligan
	</li>
	<li>
		Jean Gebser
	</li>
	<li>
		Maslow
	</li>
	<li>
		Clare Graves, Don Beck
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	It takes work on your part to integrate all this stuff and see the bigger picture. Do not expect the current state of science or academia to give you the big picture. It gives you tiny fragments which you must piece together.
</p>

You were given a list of ways to move beyond each color in each video.
</p>

<p>
	Now you must actually do it.

<p>
	It sorta is. A spiral is an upwards moving circle.
</p>

<p>
	Overall reality seems to move towards greater and greater complexity. Society is becoming more and more complex. There can certainly be collapse, but the idea that humans were more evolved 10,000 years ago than today strikes me as wrong.
</p>

<p>
	I do not see how the chaos and egotism of modern society can be avoided through collapse of society. We are more likely to pass through it by growing society, not by abolishing society.
</p>

<p>
	I like Shunya overall, but the apocalyptic aspect of his teachings I do not agree with. I once asked him about ancient Rome and he told me how great it was back then without acknowledging that 40% of the population were slaves. Not so great methinks. I will take post-modernity any day.

			Anarchy is simply without government, or rulers. It doesn't remove anything else. David Friedman has explained thoughtfully how for instance law enforcement and the justice system would work in such a society. If your daughter was raped and mother enslaved, you would be paying an Agency, which you've chosen based on your preference of laws, even before, as insurance, to track down the assailants, and then deal with the assailant's agency along with a private court to make a deal.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Ahahahahaha!
</p>

<p>
	That Agency and private court would already be owned by the dictator and his cronies. When you come to them to report the crime, they will spit in your face, take your wallet, and laugh you out of the building.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarians have no idea how human nature really works.
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as "without government or rulers". Without rulers, the strongest most ruthless narcissist becomes the ruler, enslaving everyone to his whims.
</p>

<p>
	What you are describing is worse than modern day Iraq or Afghanistan.

<p>
	I have not done SDS for a long time. I mostly use other techniques. But don't let that stop you from using it. It's a solid technique. Although I think Kriya yoga is superior.

<p>
	There are various versions of anarchism as an ideology. There are flavors of it in Orange and flavors of it in even in Green.
</p>

<p>
	You have to distinguish anarchy as a political ideology vs actual anarchy, which nobody actually wants.
</p>

<p>
	Most ideological anarchy is just mental-masturbation mixed with naivety and inexperience with how the world works.
</p>

<p>
	When your daughter is being raped and your mother enslaved, your high ideals of anarchy will fly out the window. The ego is actually terrified of actual anarchy as that means lack of control, disorder, and death.
</p>

<p>
	In an anarchic system all that would happen is that the strongest, most ruthless, more power-hungry would enslave you and you family. Order would be installed to serve the dictator. Only you would end up at the bottom of the hierarchy as one of the slaves. Unless maybe you were willing to claw your way to the middle by stabbing people in the back. This is stage Red.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	That is generally what enlightenment requires:
</p>

<p>
	1) Solid ability to concentrate one's mind
</p>

<p>
	2) Turning one's observational awareness in on itself, towards The Self
</p>

<p>
	Both components are super-important. They tend not to be effective one without the other.

<p>
	It's like you're saying that 1st grade is closer to 3rd grade because both are odd, while 2nd grade is even. So what? 2nd grade is still closer to 3rd grade.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense Green is further away from Turquoise because in its own mind it already thinks it is Turquoise. The similarity actually makes it more self-deceptive and therefore harder to ascend. At least Yellow understands that there is a Turquoise above it. Green often doesn't. There is a big difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2. In this sense Yellow is much closer to Turquoise because they're both Tier 2.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest thing Green lacks is the meta-perspective of Tier 2.

<p>
	You know... psychedelics clear up this issue very quickly. Hence their value in this work. Otherwise the mind keeps wasting years asking conceptual questions which would otherwise be answered and laid to rest in a few minutes on psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Why ask me questions when you can go straight to the source? Let God shows you the answers. It's far cooler and more fun than asking me.

	I'm not really interested in becoming a Spiral Dynamics expert. My job ends with introducing you guys to Spiral Dynamics, which I feel like I've almost completed now. Now it's up to you to do with it what you will. I got bigger fish to fry.

<p>
	Definitely don't trip in a bad mood. Wait for it to pass.
</p>

<p>
	Honestly, it does not sound like you are mature enough to use psychedelics. They may turn out to be a net negative for you. Psychedelics are no joke. They will mindfuck you big time and you must be ready to handle the aftermath.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will definitely give you insights about career and depression. The only question is, are you ready to hear the truth?
</p>

That is like idiocy 2.0. Both men's work is great.

	Never forget that slavery exists in all societies except modern and post-modern ones. Anything below modernism will involve tribal warfare, ethnic cleansing, brutal oppression of minorities, rape, racism, and enslavement.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to romanticize early cultures. They would enslave you and rape your family if given the chance.

<p>
	No, you have not understood. Otherwise you would not be here.
</p>

<p>
	None of these words mean what you think they mean.
</p>

<p>
	Materialists believe in death. Death is a fiction. It is an idea. There is no such thing as death. Nirvana is what happens when you realize that death is impossible.

<p>
	I disagree with Ken Wilber's and Shunyamurti's diagnosis of society.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is not too much Green, the problem is too much Blue/Orange. At least in American society.
</p>

<p>
	Shunyamurti has some wacky ideas about human evolution. He basically believes in cyclical stuff, not evolution or Spiral Dynamics, which to me sounds absurd.
</p>

<p>
	I would be very suspicious of anyone who ties to sell you on the idea that society is going to collapse. Maybe it will, but most likely it won't, and either way, society today is far more evolved and better than it ever was in human history.
</p>

<p>
	There definitely is a post-modern ego, but that is totally expected. No one ever claimed that post-modernity is a transcendence of ego. There is still ego, but it's far superior to stage Blue or Orange ego.
</p>

<p>
	I don't agree with Shunyamurti that society is regressing. In my view, evolution is always progressing and there is zero mistakes in the universe. The design is perfect. Even when there is an apparent regression, it is always progress.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is not some new development. Ego was always worse in the past.
</p>

<p>
	Post-modernity is not too rampant but far too lacking in society on the whole. In very narrow academic circles it might be too rampant, but academic circles do not at all represent the center of gravity of the population. Academia accounts for less than 1%. The average American has no idea what post-modernity is and could benefit a lot from its lessons.
</p>

<p>
	Politically right now in America our problem is not too much post-modernity but too much modernity and traditionalism. Just look at the abject intellectual and moral bankruptcy of the Republican party and their corrupt and abysmal public policy proposals. Conservatives are sticking their head in the sand. JP is one of them.
</p>

<p>
	Telling people to worry about the excesses of stage Green right now is a misdiagnosis of the problem. The problem is people who cling to Blue & Orange, and the ideological propaganda being marketed to them by the ilk of JP, Fox News, Steve Bannon, etc. The real problem is an excess of Blue & Orange.
</p>

So using this word is hollow for you.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness = Nothingness
</p>

<p>
	There is no such thing as consciousness. Which is what consciousness is!
</p>

<p>
	You are not going to understand any of this. So go do the actual practices.

</p>

<p>
	You're lost in the labyrinth of your own mind and projecting that confusion out onto Buddhism and the rest of us.
</p>

<p>
	There is no problem with Buddhism. The problem lies in the fact that you haven't actually done enough spiritual work, so you call up, down and down, up, and then think everyone else confused.
</p>

<p>
	All opposites are your own creation.

	Wilber criticizes Green from the above. JP criticizes Green from below. That's a very big difference.
</p>

<p>
	JP's solutions are not Yellow ones but Blue/Orange ones.

	It varies a lot person to person and time to time.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are not always predictable.

<p>
	Plugging is also a lot smoother than snorting. My first doses were snorted and a bit rough.

Understanding is what leads to deep wisdom and Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse understanding with theory or book smarts. Understanding is its own thing. It allows you to escape Maya and navigate Maya masterfully.
</p>

<p>
	Understanding is the key to everything.

</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics give powerful glimpses and insights which would otherwise take years of manual labor to get (if ever).
</p>

<p>
	Most people will never do enough hardcore spiritual practice to get as deep as psychedelics can take you within 60 minutes.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you could take a pill and become a Tiger Woods -level golfer for 1 day. Then you drop back to normal. But still, you now know what it feels like to be a world class golfer, which would otherwise take you 10 years of hardcore practice which you would probably never do.

<p>
	15mg is a small dose<br />
	20mg is a decent dose<br />
	25mg is a heavy dose<br />
	30mg is a monster dose
</p>

<p>
	At least for me. Tolerance varies person to person.
</p>

<p>
	Be very cautious with anything above 25mg. The mindfuck can become almost unbearable.

<p>
	Truth is not a concept. It is that out of which the present moment is made.

<p>
	Old motivations must die and then new ones will arise. But not necessarily immediately.
</p>

<p>
	You must give yourself time to be rudderless and trust that a new sense of purpose will emerge from that.

<p>
	He's also wrong about pure chemicals being worse than herbs. Pure chemicals are actually superior to herbs.
</p>

<p>
	The reason pure chemicals aren't used by shamans is because they don't know organic chemistry and they lack fancy lab equipment. All of this is cutting edge stuff which has not permeated the culture yet.

	He's wrong about one thing: people get intoxicated by gurus all the time.
</p>

<p>
	A guru can be more dangerous than a psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that psychedelics are dangerous but gurus are not, is just not borne out by the historical facts.

<title>What are existential issues?</title>

<p>
	Metaphysical issues as opposed to psychological or human-centric issues.
</p>

<p>
	For example, figuring out how to make money or get laid are not existential issues. They are merely the pursuit of your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Questioning whether money or other people are even real would be an existential pursuit.
</p>

<p>
	You may be having lots of sex but do you understand that you are having sex with an illusion?

	The problem is that the ego does not know what true happiness or love are. The ego's selfishness and falsehood is precisely what prevents true happiness and love.

<p>
	That is merely due to lack of proper theoretical foundation, lack of self-inquiry, lack of meditation skill, incorrect dosage, and lack of consistent tripping.
</p>

<p>
	How silly would it be if NASA sent one rover to Mars and then said, "Okay, we're done. But we're so confused about Mars." To understand Mars requires hundreds of missions. One mission doesn't mean jack. It raises more questions than it answers.

<p>
	Truth is much bigger than happiness. Truth is there even if you're not happy. Truth is the only thing you can count on in this evanescent world.

<p>
	Psychedelics will definitely not wake society up auto-magically. Psychedelics do not eliminate the work, they thrust you deep into it. And most people have no foundation for how to deal with that.
</p>

<p>
	I do not push psychedelics on everyone. I recommend them only to serious self-actualizers, which is less than 1% of the general population.

<p>
	This is not CNN where ignorance is given equal weight as truth in the name of neutrality.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately if you don't agree with a spiritual teacher's guidance you should find another teacher. The guidance is sometimes given sternly, without room for debate, because the spiritual teacher has a greater depth of understanding than you. He's doing it for your benefit even though your ego may not like it.
</p>

<p>
	It's in poor taste to think you know more than the teacher. In that case, why be his student?
</p>

<p>
	And this is not to say the teacher is always right.

	LSD is outstanding. For me it is second best to 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	But people will have various opinions because psychedelics affect people differently.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are not as simple as people think. You don't just pop a pill and get the same result. Results vary ENORMOUSLY depending on many factors.
</p>

<p>
	If it has to be explained, you don't got it. And no explanation will help you get it.
</p>

<p>
	This is the most profound question you can possibly answer. You have no idea how significant the answer is. It will derail your whole life.
</p>

<p>
	They call it rebirth for good reason.

	Leo is a fantasy. Like Santa Clause.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	I didn't under sell it. Your mind was just full of stage Orange judgments and demonizations of Green. Now you see more clearly.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a great stage.
</p>

<p>
	Turquoise you cannot even imagine yet.

<p>
	There is a very definite explanation.
</p>

<p>
	But if you knew it, you'd cease to exist and be enlightened.
</p>

<p>
	The ego-mind cannot answer that question because it requires the realization that ego-mind is a fiction. Which means you die at that precise moment.
</p>

<p>
	So the cost of answering that question is your death.
</p>

<p>
	Still want to know?
</p>

	No, you are merely stripped of fantasies and childish hangups. You become more authentic.

<p>
	Yes, seeking ideals is a big trap in this work. Eventually you're gonna have to surrender all of your ideals for the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately this work is not about becoming a great person or even being happy. It's about discovering what is life and how it works. When you get to the rock bottom of it your perspective on life will change so dramatically that you will even cease to think you were ever born.
</p>

<p>
	If happiness comes, it will be a byproduct of a deep understanding how life works.

	The Absolute in none other than all arising contingent phenomena.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute is all that exists. If you can see it, it is the Absolute. Your toilet is the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	If look at your toilet real closely, for a long time, you will realize it is God.
</p>

<p>
	That's nonduality. Nothing is hidden or separate.
