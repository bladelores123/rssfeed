<p>
	Your expectations of me are your own doing.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes I am soft, sometimes I am blunt. I'm not gonna be sweetness all the time. That is not authentic or even ideal.

So all your ideas and ideals fly out the window. You can tell yourself you're fearless but when the floor beneath your feet disappears, you'll be in for surprises you could not anticipate or prepare for.
</p>

<p>
	Faith and love are of course great things to bring into the trip. But you never know how twisting things will get. Sometimes a trip just goes hairy for no apparent reason beyond your ability to control it.
</p>

<p>
	If you trip long enough you will get some very hairy trips. The key is to go with the flow and for fucks sake never resist them. Surrender to the hairiness. That alone with grow you a lot.
</p>

<title>Having so much free time makes me spend it unwisely</title>

<p>
	Yeah, that's why self-employment is so hard and most people just cannot do it. Because it takes serious vision and self-discipline to be able to lead yourself. Most people are sheep who suck on the tit of society. They need a boss just to tell them when to wake up, otherwise they would become vegetables.
</p>

<p>
	The self-determined life is not the easy life. The easy life is working at Starbucks for 40 years and then retiring without a single dream or deep thought about life.
</p>

<p>
	You need to have a serous over-arching vision and purpose to your life if you're gonna go it alone. You need to be a fuckin boss on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Being a successful musician is not just about musical skills. You also need marketing and business skills.
</p>

<p>
	It may be necessary to keep your dentistry gig for now. But eventually if dentistry is not your passion but music is, you want to transition to place where your music can support you. That might take some years and some clever business scheming. You'd need to build a brand of some kind.

	I don't really know what that means.
</p>

<p>
	Stick to the core principles of course. Flashy game is bad game. The best game is chill, friendly, and so natural it doesn't look like game at all.
</p>

<p>
	Seek to be totally natural, congruent, authentic, and humble. Natural, chill, and authentic works like magic.
</p>

<p>
	When you boil game down to its essence you'll discover it's just you being you to the hilt. But it takes A LOT of experience to reach that point.

<p>
	Nothing is ever right or wrong. It's a question of who you wish to be. And the consequences of your actions.
</p>

<p>
	Think twice before pissing into the wind.

	Great work!
</p>

<p>
	Except you won't really die. There is no such thing as death. Only the idea of you will die. The real YOU is immortal.

<p>
	Yes, but even if you take weeks apart the trips will still get deeper and deeper and deeper.
</p>

<p>
	It will mindfuck you either way.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful what you wish for. You are not ready to see the Full Monty. You can never be ready. It's far too radical and shocking. It will suckerpunch you. It can easily traumatize you.

	EVERYONE is attracted to high consciousness beings, not just women.
</p>

<p>
	Because God is the greatest thing you can be. And people flock to be near it like moths to a flame.
</p>

<p>
	Deep down everyone craves love and consciousness.

<p>
	Of course not. Rather you generate a loving vision of your future. You imagine your highest future and feel that feeling. Then you go build it.
</p>

<p>
	You can't escape McDonalds by feeling shitty. You escape McDonalds by feeling inspiring about what you will create next.

<p>
	Use positive feeling as your launch fuel. Negative feeling is the devil sucking out your soul.

<p>
	Any feeling that is fear-based you should not trust.

<p>
	The problem isn't feelings themselves, it's what the ego-mind does with them.

<p>

	Look at what JP demonstrates, not what he says. He says to take responsibility but then he makes a career out of blaming others for the world's problems: feminists, marxists, leftists, hippies, liberal professors, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Scapegoating 101
</p>

<p>
	Weak men use JP to blame women for their lack of sex and lack of manhood.
</p>

<p>
	JP does not yet realize what it means to pick up the cross of God.

<p>
	It requires LOTS of mindfulness practice.
</p>

<p>
	Consider taking a 10 day Vipasanna retreat. That will open your eyes to the power of body awareness in a way that you cannot presently imagine.
</p>

<p>
	You could spend the next 10 years just sitting on a couch and feeling your body. And you'd still not feel everything there is to feel there. The body is a very complex and subtle organic technology. It's more intelligent than any Western science can imagine. Every cell in your body has its own innate intelligence.

	Yes, you can claim to be a religious organization. But in this case, the money is not technically yours, it's the organization's. You can't use it for personal expenses. You must use it for organization business. If you pay yourself a salary you will get taxed on that.
</p>

<p>
	It's like a non-profit organization.
</p>

<p>
	I could claim Actualized.org as a religious organization. Because that's what it basically is. "Religous" here just means spiritual.

<title>To All Struggling Males: Stop Playing Victim!</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/34866-to-all-struggling-males-stop-playing-victim/?do=findComment&amp;comment=424506</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/3-dating-relationships-sexuality/">Dating, Relationships, Sexuality</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	I see a chronic problem on this sub-forum, which is young males who complain about lack of success with women and failing to take responsibility for their situation.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 rule of all growth and personal development is taking 100% responsibility for your situation. I know how hard that can be when you're struggling with women/sex. It feels very much like life is treating you unfairly and that it's the women's fault. Let me tell you right now: this is a total ILLUSION! It's not the women. It's not society. It's not post-modernists. It's not the Marxists. It's not the feminists. It's YOU!
</p>

<p>
	This is not me blaming you. This is simply how all personal development works. Whatever problem you have in life you must begin by getting honest with yourself how you created it. Sometimes this is difficult to accept. It's much easier to blame someone else, or even blame yourself (for being too ugly or too short or too introverted). I am not suggesting you blame yourself. Rather, take ownership of the fact that you are the creator of your life. Whatever is missing in your life, you can correct, but only if you stop blaming yourself and others.
</p>

<p>
	Be very mindful of how your ego-mind creates narratives which justify your sense of lack, brokenness, or inability to attract women. All of these narratives, justification, rationalizations, logic, "facts", scientific studies, proofs, etc are sneakily fabricated by your own mind! Your own mind is the enemy! Watch it like a hawk. Your mind will try to come up with reasons and excuses for why your life is unfair and how success with women is impossible. This is all horseshit! Do not believe your own mind here. Your mind is clouded by fear, insecurity, and neediness. That is totally normal and understandable, but you cannot resolve your problems from such a place. From such a place your problems will get worse as you start to blame the world and solidify your victim worldview with cherry-picked evidence, "science", and "logic". Be extra suspicious of "logic" and "science" here. There is nothing logical or scientific about your victim attitude or lack of success with women. It's purely about meeting the survival needs of your ego. Sex is a very powerful survival need which will drive your mind towards all manner of mental gymnastics to ensure that you get it, or at least feel better for not getting it.
</p>

<p>
	There's good news and bad news. The good news is: Your looks are NOT the problem! The bad news is: your personality, attitude, and mindset are terrible! The good news is, it's possible to change that. The bad news is, it won't be easy and you will resist it like the devil that you are.
</p>

<p>
	So what's the solution? Take ownership of your problem and commit to resolving it. For this you need faith and confidence in your ability to self-actualize. You must have enough hope and vision to see yourself get much better with attracting women. This is NOT a pipe dream or fuzzy thinking. The reality is that any man can become 100x better at attracting women if he really takes ownership of the matter. Yes, it takes serious work. But it's also highly worth it. Imagine that within 3 years you're able to attract pretty women and feel confident about yourself when it comes to dating. Isn't that worth the effort? It sure is. This is not a fantasy. I've done it, many men have done it, and so can you! Your looks are NOT the bottleneck, your mindset is.
</p>

<p>
	So what do you do after you've established this vision? You must do lots of research to educate yourself about how dating actually work (not how you think it works). Find videos, find books, buy online courses, hire a coach, take a bootcamp, take a workshop, etc. There are literally hundreds of excellent resources available online these days. Most of them are legit, not scams. Study them hard and then get into the field. Start talking to women. Start approaching women. Start flirting with women. Start being much more social.
</p>

<p>
	If you struggle attracting women I can tell you right now what your top problems are. It's not lack of money, looks, muscles, car, height, or dick size. Remember, attraction and dating is EXTREMELY counter-intuitive. It's works exactly the opposite of how you initially think.
</p>

<p>
	Your top problems are:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		You live in your mancave and never go out! You must go out into social spaces where real women hang out.
	</li>
	<li>
		You spend WAY too much time online, indoors
	</li>
	<li>
		You spend WAY too much time on Youtube, Netflix, and playing video games
	</li>
	<li>
		You work too much
	</li>
	<li>
		You are never around cute single women
	</li>
	<li>
		You never start conversations with strangers
	</li>
	<li>
		You have terrible body language due to lack of experience
	</li>
	<li>
		You are not comfortable doing small-talk and being emotional and random in conversations
	</li>
	<li>
		You are far too logical
	</li>
	<li>
		You approach zero women on a regular basis
	</li>
	<li>
		You are terrified of approaching a women who you find attractive, talking yourself out of every approach
	</li>
	<li>
		You have terrible eye contact, you don't smile, and you don't project your voice properly
	</li>
	<li>
		You are crippled by fear and tongue-tied
	</li>
	<li>
		You are unable to start and sustain an interesting conversation with a human being
	</li>
	<li>
		You are disconnected from your body, your heart, your feelings, your emotions
	</li>
	<li>
		You have terrible self-image issues. You hate yourself, you hate how you look, you judge yourself way too harshly. You judge yourself just as harshly as you judge women.
	</li>
	<li>
		You have a bad sense of dress style and you don't groom yourself well
	</li>
	<li>
		You have no experience with physically touching women in a non-creepy way. You don't know how to rapidly physically escalate on a women without creeping her out.
	</li>
	<li>
		You don't know how women think or what they truly value in a man
	</li>
	<li>
		You don't know how to flirt and be authentic
	</li>
	<li>
		You are trying to be masculine in all the wrong ways -- fake masculinity
	</li>
	<li>
		You are needy, needy, needy
	</li>
	<li>
		You are terribly inexperienced
	</li>
	<li>
		You have no sense of passion or purpose in life, which robs you of confidence and masculine vitality
	</li>
	<li>
		Your attitude sucks: you whine, complain, bitch, moan, blame, and are so negative
	</li>
	<li>
		You think you understand life, reality, and how attraction works -- you don't!
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	So work on fixing all of that before you go blaming women. All of the above can be deliberately worked on and fixed.
</p>

<p>
	You need to learn how to be a real man. Being a real man has nothing to do with big muscles, big dick, or a fast car. A real man is grounded on the INSIDE. It's ALL about inner game! You need to cultivate that confidence. It doesn't come naturally. You must build it!
</p>

<p>
	80% of getting good with women is just actually being much more social. You need to deliberately re-structure your life so that you're automatically being more social. So that you're going out every weekend. So that you're bumping into new people constantly. So that you're making new friends all the time. This kind of re-structuring is very doable. You just have to be willing to change your lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
	And stop watching or listening to any of the following:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Jordan Peterson, MGTOW, RedPill, Incel material/forums/reddit
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	All of that is cancer of the mind. It's reinforcing your victim mindset and robbing you of your ability to change yourself.
</p>

<p>
	I've been where you are. I know it's tough. But hang in there, hold your vision, have hope, get to work, and things will dramatically improve for you. You will become a new person by the end of this journey and you will be so proud of yourself. You will become a real man, not some whiny JP fanboy.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 thing a real man does is take 100% responsibility for all his problems. A real man NEVER blames anyone, and certainly not women or feminism. A real man is a feminist. A real man fearlessly works on himself.
</p>

<p>
	So start right there! Start by fixing that.
</p>

Society rewards tons of "alpha" men. You can find thousands of examples which will blow your narrative out of the water.
</p>

<p>
	The meta problem here is that your ego is just spinning whatever kind of narratives suits it. There is no truth in such mental activities. This is not deep understanding of reality, life, gender, or society. It's ego games.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is constantly interpreting the world in such a way that you see precisely what most serves your ego and reinforces your existing worldview, no matter how fictitious it happens to be. Notice this. And go meta. Stop playing the game at that low level.

<p>
	Jesus is up in heaven laughing and crying at what they do in his name.

A stage Green Christian is exactly that. Foaming at the mouth Christians are not true Christians, they are fakes. So the irony is that Obama is a truer Christian than most Republicans.
</p>

<p>
	Did Obama dumb himself down a bit? Perhaps. I mean politics requires some degree of manipulating one's public image. That can't be avoided entirely.

<p>
	You are creating all of reality and your so-called physical body. But you are not aware of how.
</p>

<p>
	The more aware you become, the more stuff about yourself you will be able to change. Certainly you can change all the stuff you listed. Growing a third arm might be out of your human capacities. But you as God are imagining both your arms into being. There are just certain limits to being in our present human forms. Something has to stay constant to ground this life of yours until death. After death the limits drop away.

<p>
	You are God! You create EVERYTHING!
</p>

<p>
	It's merely a question of how conscious are you that you do so.
</p>

<p>
	Creation is not a simplistic thing. There are many layers to it. So it's not as simple as you imagining a unicorn and it materializes into the air.
</p>

<p>
	But consider the possibility that even that might be possible if you were sufficiently conscious of all the layers.

	Should and shouldn't don't exist. You are free to do whatever you want. But conscious beings care about their environment in the same way they care about not poisoning their bodies.

<p>
	Yes, it's possible.
</p>

<p>
	But realize that in the ultimate sense you and them are one.
</p>

<p>
	Whoever you are talking to in life, whether aliens, angles, or humans, you're really just talking to yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But also keep in mind that it <u><strong>is</strong></u> possible to get wisdom and guidance from "others". If the wisdom rings true, might as well follow it. Just be careful taking the words of "others" on blind faith. You need to validate the wisdom in your direct experience, as with any teacher or teaching. Your personal experience is the ultimate authority.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't get too dependent on "others". Stand on your own two legs.
</p>

	From Kim's POV it does not even matter if Trump is truthworthy. Even if Trump is the nicest guy in the world, in 2-6 years he will be out of office and Kim will have to deal with a new US administration which will want to overthrown him if an overthrow is easily possible without killing millions of people. So Kim's incentive is to be able to kill millions of people in order to survive.
</p>

<p>
	The North Koreans are not stupid. They are very selfish. So the last thing they'll do is undermine their own survival odds.
</p>

<p>
	Kim handing over his nukes is like Trump handing over his taxes. Lol. Trump says he doesn't mind handing over his taxes, but he never will. It's just a ploy.

You're overlooking something.
</p>

<p>
	Environment is a relative term defined against the human self.
</p>

<p>
	By neglecting the environment people are precisely failing to realize that environment and self are one. Because they are convinced that environment is something "other" which they don't need to care about as long as their body is cared for. But the body cannot be cared for without caring for the environment.
</p>

<p>
	Unity and holism is the highest truth. Anything short of that leads to pathology.

<p>
	I will soon shoot a video on all that.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's a bit tricky.
</p>

<p>
	Will can be exercised without moral judgment. For example, if a child is playing with Legos, the child can choose what she wants to build. Anything she builds is perfect. There is no right or wrong or best or worst thing to build. But she still exercises will. Will is creation itself! Will is what's deciding what will be created.
</p>

<p>
	Try not to look at it as good or bad. Creation is done for its own sake, not because something is lacking. The creator doesn't need anything, it's just creating for the sheer joy of creation. You can train to live your life in such a matter. Then you create but you're detached from your creation.

			Why was it that Zen practitioners 400 years ago could successfully attain enlightenment an THEY didn't have a prepaid smartphone nor access to the video "Being a Zen Devil."?

</blockquote>

<p>
	You ignore that many of them did not. In fact most Zen practitioners never fully awaken. The failure rate is very high.
</p>

<p>
	And you ignore that many of them, even after they awoke, were still devils who abused, molested, raped, and even killed. Zen monasteries waged entire wars against each other, slaughtering monks by the hundreds.
</p>

<p>
	Having a satori is just the start. It is not mastery by any means. And without good teachings devilry is pretty much guaranteed.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, teachings about enlightenment are not enlightenment. But they can still be very useful for keeping you on the right track. By saying little about enlightenment the teacher leaves a lot of room for misinterpretation and falling into traps. While enlightenment cannot be described well with words, the traps can be.

<p>
	Intuition is your HIGHEST feeling. It is the voice of your soul/spirit.
</p>

<p>
	And don't discount feelings either! Feelings are faithful indicators of how things really are for you. Listen to your feelings more, not less. The problem is that you repress and judge your feelings too much. This is what gets you into trouble.
</p>

<p>
	Feel your feelings without reacting to them or overthinking them. Just feel for the sake of feeling, not as a means to some end.

<p>
	Ego and militancy go hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest egos cause the most violence, suffering, and death.
</p>

<p>
	Because ego is always in fear it must lash out at others. Ego is fundamentally insecure about itself. And Trump is the most insecure president we've ever had. So it's bound to manifest in ugly ways.
</p>

<p>
	Enemies only exist from an ego's POV. A conscious person has no enemies.

</p>

<p>
	But either path is valid. Sometimes you gotta be foolish for many years to realize what wisdom is.
</p>

<p>
	Given Tyson's starting point, his path was just right, for him. I wouldn't recommend it for most people though. Too painful. It's like punching yourself in the nuts over and over again just to learn not to do that.

</p>

<p>
	But also stick around for more advanced theory. You still have much advanced stuff to learn. Vipassana lone will not be enough. There are many important things Vipassana will not teach you. This not a critique of Vipassana. It's just one tool within a much larger framework. All tools have their limits.

	Beautiful!
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, success is really no different than religion. It serves the exact same function for the ego.
</p>

<p>
	Success becomes one's God until the true God is found.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Don't confuse my degree of openmindedness and self-reflection with that of Republican.
</p>

<p>
	I have no problem re-evaluating my positions and changing them. I've changed my positions and worldview more than you can imagine.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump denuclearizes North Korea, I will acknowledge it and my understanding of him will change. I will have to admit that I underestimated him.
</p>

<p>
	But I wouldn't bet on that happening. There's higher odds of him starting WWIII.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way North Korea will give up its nukes given the US's penchant for regime change. Kim would be suicidal to do so. If he gives up his nukes the US will want to bomb and overthrow him like in Iran, Iraq, and Libya.
</p>

<p>
	Think about it, if you were a dictator and you had nukes, why would you ever give them up? Having them means you will never get invaded. The US cannot invade North Korea because they would nuke South Korea. So counter-intuitively those nukes are maintaining peace.
</p>

<p>
	North Korea having nukes is not as big a problem as people make it out to be. They would never use them aggressively because they know it would be suicidal. If North Korea ever used a nuke first, they would be nuked by the US until there was nothing left of North Korea. And they know this. North Korean nukes cannot even reach most of the US. So they are severely overpowered by the US. So all that having a few nukes does for North Korea is provide a nice obstacle to US invasion.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that the US is the aggressor, not North Korea. North Korea is practicing self-defense. Which is totally expected. What else can they do? They have to maintain their regime as any ego would do.
</p>

<p>
	I'm always open to being proven wrong. The above position is not ideological dogma. It's just my best analysis of the situation. Of course my analysis can be disproven in the future. You can't do better than your best analysis at any given point in time. Political analysis is never Absolute, it's probabilistic given so many unknown variables.

<p>
	God is both beyond it, but also IT.
</p>

<p>
	Who created possible and impossible? God!
</p>

<p>
	Anything which you can think of or experience is a creation. It had to be created or there would be nothing there. So if it was created, who created it? God/You did!
</p>

<p>
	And who created God? God created itself of course! How can God do that? Because God hasn't yet created possible or impossible, so it wasn't limited in any way. So it could do crazy mind-bending stuff like creating itself. That's what unlimitedness allows. It's TOTAL FREEDOM! A lack of all boundaries, definitions, or rules.
</p>

<p>
	God is not bound by rules because the rules had to be created by it. God is prior to all rules, but at the same time, God is all the rules! Because God is inseparable from its creation. Whatever God creates, it is being. God's creation is God's body, so to speak. Without this "body" God exists as pure formlessness. God's body is the whole universe. God's body is constantly morphing and changing, creating the illusion of movement and life.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, that's is the myopia of your current level of development. As you develop higher you will reach a point where you will realize the deep interconnectedness of yourself and your community. And then such a dualistic attitude as you now hold will become untenable.
</p>

<p>
	There is still a fundamental selfishness to your position.
</p>

<p>
	To neglect your community is to neglect yourself, since you and other are one.
</p>

<p>
	But do as you like. I am not judging you, just making a prediction about where you growth can take you.
</p>

<p>
	I see that many of you folks here need a serious education in the connection between spirituality and politics. Spiritual work alone is not enough to make one politically wise. Especially not with the traditional non-integral spiritual schools like Zen, Vedanta, etc. This is a major spiritual pathology: neglecting ecological concerns for personal salvation. It's about as selfish as eating all the food on the life-raft while others are looking the other way.

The only question is whether you are creating consciously or unconsciously.
</p>

<p>
	To refuse the call of taking ownership of your godly creative capacity is a creation you create. If you choose to sit in your Mom's basement your whole life eating Cheetos and jerking off to anime, that's what you as God created. But you did so not aware that you could have created something else. And so in effect you created a devil of yourself.

</p>

<p>
	He would call himself a communist if that allowed him to advance his narcissistic agenda. You misunderstand his motives. In his mind whatever gets him the most power, money, fame, and sex is what's considered true and valid.

<p>
	There is one thing which is impossible: for God not to be God.
</p>

<p>
	Or, put another way: it is impossible for everything not to be as it is.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to frame it is: possible/impossible is a duality which collapses into unity at the level of the Absolute. So actually it's impossible to distinguish between possible/impossible. Until you do. Until you don't.

	No. People will vote however they want. But if people were more engaged in the process, more knowledgeable, more conscious, they would elect more conscious and humane leaders.
</p>

<p>
	The quality of our leaders directly reflect the quality of the voters.
</p>

<p>
	If you follow Actualized.org and you don't vote, that's one conscious person surrendering his responsibility to devils.
</p>

<p>
	The key here is that you must take responsibility for being a member of society. Stop thinking of yourself as merely an individual. You are NOT merely that. Wake up to the fact that you are part of a community. In a conscious community members act for the good of each other.
</p>

<p>
	I will talk more about that soon.
</p>

<p>
	But in a nutshell, your work is be a Creator, embody the Goodness, Love, and Wisdom of God in your life. To truly be God is to live a God-like life. It's not enough to realize God and then go back to working at Starbucks. Your vision of your life must match that which a God would create. Would a God sit around while the Earth was raped and pillaged by devils? Guess again.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you don't have to. But if you fully understood your power, you probably wouldn't squander your life as you now do.
</p>

<p>
	See, right now you are not a conscious creator. But God is a conscious creator. You must take ownership of your creative capacity. Which is a distinct thing from enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	As the saying goes: You work towards "A more perfect union"
</p>

<p>
	Today conscious creators are more needed than ever before in human history. Or civilization will collapse.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Be careful with your false equivalencies. There is no equivalence between the Democrats and Republicans right now.
</p>

<p>
	And voting in primaries is even more important than the general election. So your vote DOES matter. US elections hinge on very small margins. Trump won by a hundred thousands votes at most. Gore lost by thousands of votes.
</p>

<p>
	So in America your vote actually counts A LOT. In NY you could vote for better representatives and state legislators. You just have to start treating politics seriously, not the nonsense you see on Youtube of people "owning" each other.
</p>

<p>
	Not voting directly leads to war and other kinds of devilry. As it happening right now. Trump is laying the groundwork for a war with Iran. Which would be catastrophic.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Although that's already been sorta found with 5-MeO-DMT. Not sure what more magic pill you could want.
</p>

<p>
	The obstacle isn't the pill, it's that you don't actually want to awaken. You like stalling and dragging this out. So contrary to what people naively assume, a magic pill for enlightenment will not awaken the world because more importantly the world has to want to awaken. Which it doesn't. So the real work is in getting the world to truly want to awaken.

<p>
	No! Trump is nowhere near Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Trump hasn't read a single book in his life! Lol
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse his BS "deals" for real deals. It's all posturing and fakery. There is no deal with North Korea. North Korea is playing him and they will never denuclearize. The reason Trump gets along well with dictators is because that's the level of consciousness he's at (Red). It's easier for him to get along with Kim or Putin than with a European Green leader.
</p>

<p>
	If Hitler or Stalin were alive, Trump would probably get along well with them.
</p>

<p>
	Stop rationalizing Trump's actions as somehow strategic brilliance or 3-dimensional chess. It's is pure ego and opportunism. Like a hyena. Trump is playing checkers while Kim and Putin are playing 3D chess. The North Koreans are very savvy players. And the Russians even more so.

<p>
	As for what you can do, you can awaken yourself and demonstrate your wokeness through your life. By being a powerful role-model people will naturally gravitate towards you. But you'll have to train yourself to be that way.

<p>
	That's exactly right, you do need it. God cannot know itself unless it knows suffering. Bliss cannot be known or apprecaited without first suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Life would be incomplete without suffering.

</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind there are various degrees of awakening. The initial shallow levels can feel nihilistic. But then you discover God, Infinity, Love, and Goodness as Absolutes and you fall in love with reality. It's truly too good to believe. The goodness is so good you will deny its reality at first.
</p>

<p>
	It's too good for the ego to handle without imploding. Which is why the ego judges it. Love is a threat to your very way of life because you have been living in fear.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is like a rabid dog which bites the hand of the doctor who tries to cure it. That is the divine tragedy.

<p>
	Yes, just think of consciousness at the "stuff" of reality. So replace trillions and trillions of atoms with one field of consciousness. This field is like an LCD screen which can display any image: dog, tree, human, alien, etc. The screen is unlimited in what it can display. God is that entire screen and also all the images it displays. Image and screen are one. Right now you are one image. After this image dies, a new image will appear. And so on forever. So nothing actually dies, it just changes images.

	The full Truth and nothing but the Truth is hard for a mere moral to accept, especially after a lifetime of lies, self-deception, and dualistic social conditioning.
</p>

<p>
	But it's wonderful once you get past all that.
</p>

<p>
	The Truth only looks upsetting when it's seen from a position of falsehood. Truth stings the devil because it threatens to transform him into God. For a devil not to become God he must deny Truth. So that's what devils are constantly doing. Otherwise they'd be God.

Yopo extraction will yield bufotinine, which is a very different chemical. It's got a very high bodyload.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is a very delicate molecule which gets destroyed via traditional extraction methods. There is also very little of it there in the plant to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	You are better off milking a toad if you want "natural" 5-MeO.

<title>Questions about &quot;The Power Of Asking Questions&quot;</title>

BUT! This doesn't make intellectual contemplation useless. You must start somewhere. You cannot just jump instantly into a profound mystical experience. You must first ask quality questions to prepare your mind. This questioning sets intent and direction. It gets your mind looking in the right direction. It makes you curious. It makes you question and doubt everything you think you know, which then opens up the mind to have a mystical experience.
</p>

<p>
	So the two are profoundly connected.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you could just have immediate mystical experiences it would not be sufficient because your mind still has to interpret them properly, make sense of them, speak about them in some coherent way, interconnect various distinct experiences, and figure out how to apply them in a complex social world. Which is why quality thinking is still important, even after awakening. You can't just completely skip over the mind. The mind is still there. It still holds various beliefs and opinions and worldviews. A lot of work goes into purify all that so that your mind becomes ready to do God's work. To skip the mind is to get stuck with the old corrupt mind that you started with.
</p>

It both is and is not self-conscious. Some parts of reality are self-conscious while others are not. A dog is not self-conscious but a Zen master is. The dog does not know it is God, a Zen master does.
</p>

<p>
	The substance of reality is CONSCIOUSNESS, but be careful, as this does not automatically mean that all parts of reality are conscious of themselves. CONSCIOUSNESS is not the same a self-consciousness. Consciousness/God is so powerful it can imagine itself to be a dog, thus forgetting that it is actually God. When that dog dies it will realize that is was God the whole time, merely pretending to be a dog.
</p>

<p>
	At the highest level, God is fully aware of itself as God. But as its various incarnations it can be deluded and unaware. Just as you right now are unaware that you God. You are conscious but not fully Self-conscious.

</p>

<p>
	A vision for your life will never be found in any external object or event. The vision must come from deep inside your mind/heart.
</p>

<p>
	You can do a bunch of stuff, and that might be good grist for the mill, but eventually you have to sit down and imagineer your highest vision.
</p>

<p>
	Be visionary! Don't discount the power of your mind. Creativity comes from inside you.

</p>

<p>
	Better yet, consider hiring a dating coach or taking a bootcamp. Getting good a dating is extremely hands-on. You cannot learn it as a theory. None of the theory translates into real life. You need massive field experience.
</p>

<p>
	50 parts experience to 1 part theory. Otherwise no results.
</p>

<p>
	For cold approach to work you need to be doing 100s of approaches each month. At least until you develop some skill. Then you can ease up.

<p>
	I would expect that most people following Actualized.org are in the first two phases, as you're lost and looking for answers and direction. People in the 3rd phase are probably too busy to watch self-help videos.

</blockquote>

<p>
	That is a goal when you're on a retreat with the intention of breaking through into deep states of samadhi.
</p>

<p>
	But outside of that life must go on, and in fact you will need advanced types of thinking to act effectively in the world and help the world to awaken.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to denigrate the mind. The mind is an important tool. Acting mindlessly will result in foolishness.
</p>

<p>
	The trick is not to identify with your thinking and the conclusions of your thinking. Most people think about stuff and then they turn the end result of that into an identity.
</p>

			"My" question is, after an enlightenment experience, is it usual for the ego voice, the linguistic thaught voice to be in your head? Basically, for ego thinking continue? As it's still continuing for "me" 
		</p>

		<p>
			And does that mean that this mini enlightenment experience of the ego admiring itself to be a lie and realizing, becoming enlightenment itself and as the true self as enlightenment itself only small parts of a much larger enlightenment journey? 
		</p>

		<p>
			At full enlightenment does the ego voice disappear forever? Or does it remain? And how does contemplation/thinking happen without the voice? Does thinking happen at all? Is there still contemplation in the usual way or does the nature of the way contemplation happens change?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That ego voice gets recontextualized as the voice of God.
</p>

<p>
	That's God talking to itself!
</p>

<p>
	The voice does not need to disappear. Thoughts serve a very useful function.
</p>

<p>
	The goal is not to stop thoughts but to realize that thoughts are not your only identity. And to get peace from your thoughts when you desire it. The average person gets carried away by her thoughts, totally lost in them. An awake person still has thoughts but isn't dominated by them.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to demonize thoughts, or judge thoughts as bad. Also be careful not to adopt an anti-intellectual form of spirituality, where advanced forms of thinking about the world are dismissed and denied. For example, systems thinking is still very important for resolving world problems and actualizing God's Goodness. Living in a cave is not a sustainable solution to world problems.
</p>

<p>
	Spirit and intellect must be integrated. Your thought process must become multi-dimensional and suffused with spirit rather than suppressed.
</p>

<p>
	Thoughts are really only a problem when they are egoistical thoughts: thoughts of selfishness, manipulation, fear, judgment, rationalization, criticism, blaming, greed, lying, jealousy, denial, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Purify your thoughts of all that toxic stuff.
</p>
