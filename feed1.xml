<p>
	Self-bias.
</p>

<p>
	It is a rare mind that is willing to examine and surrender all of its biases.
</p>

<p>
	What ego is willing to admit that the rape of one's daughter is not objectively bad? The ego-mind has a hard time seeing through such biases and projections.

<p>
	It certainly might. But western nations have no obligation to support Iraq endlessly. In the end you guys gotta govern yourselves. And if you can't, then you will devolve to whatever level of governance your level of collective development can support. Iraq is not really developed enough to sustain a democracy. So it's like digging a hole in the middle of the ocean.

<p>
	It probably is good, but the US has limited resources too. We have already spent trillions on Iraq and there is little appetite left for more.
</p>

<p>
	No amount of money in the world can raise Iraq from stage Purple/Red to Orange within a few years. That will require a century of hard development work.
</p>

<p>
	If I were you I would focus more on things that are within your control, like your own development. Dwelling on this negative political stuff is robbing you of precious mental energy.

<p>
	It's always gonna be an almost impossible situation because you cannot force someone to grow. They have to do it at their own pace.
</p>

<p>
	Slowly you can introduce ideas and things from the higher stages to her, but there's no guarantee it will stick, and you shouldn't really expect anyone to grow to Yellow or above because it's statistically very rare.
</p>

<p>
	Most people are lost causes. Or rather, they will only grow at a snail's pace. It takes about 5 years to grow up by 1 level, and that assumes the person is eagerly and actively doing personal development. Most relationships don't last that long.

But then you have to act on it.
</p>

<p>
	As an autistic guy, your problem is gonna be too much theory and too little action.
</p>

<p>
	Basically all you gotta do is go out, be social, be playful with girls, and close. Too much theory beyond that will only get you too stuck in your head. You won't be able to execute it in front of the girl.

<p>
	Do not keep creating these gender war debates.
</p>

<p>
	Men have a different agenda than you. The end. If you want to talk about how to create deep relationships as part of your personal development, go ahead. But don't debate how men should drop their agenda for you. Attraction advice is not designed for you women, it's designed for men to solve their problems. Since you don't have their problems the advice falls on deaf ears. Really, the solution here is that women should not listen to attraction advice for men. You should be listening to advice designed to improve your love life, not a man's -- because you're not a man.
</p>

<p>
	It would be like if walked into a women's dressing room and started complaining that you ladies spend too much time on makeup. Stop wearing makeup and stop talking about makeup because it offends me when you do so.
</p>

<p>
	Don't compliment. Don't place yourself in a lower position than her, like you do with your boots comment. Your boots comment makes it sounds like you're afraid of her boots crushing you. This sets the opposite frame of what you want.
</p>

<p>
	Also don't invest yourself into these matches. Shoot a text and move on. You invest too much into them. You need higher volume and less investment.

<p>
	Do not be sexual.
</p>

<p>
	If the girl truly likes you, you don't need to game her much. The problem is they don't really like you to begin with, otherwise they would be receptive to a simple "Hey there".
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind there is a lot of fake profiles and girls just looking for validation and ego-boosts on apps like Tinder.
</p>

<p>
	Girls are not above using guys purely for validation with no intention of fucking them.
</p>

<p>
	Your best opener is gonna be a short unique funny line.

<p>
	In practice the only thing you need to be successful with women is to go out and approach.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Counter-intuitively yes. Lot of pickup actually teaches you how to be more expressive like a girl. To flow more with your feelings. Most guys are so stuck in their heads they are disconnected from their feelings. Feelings are not just feminine, they are also masculine.
</p>

<p>
	You will attract way more girls by being emotionally expressive than you will by being stoic.
</p>

<p>
	It's similar to how you talk to children or dogs. You adopt an over-emotionalized, playful attitude. You don't treat the interaction seriously. Likewise when attracting women. Treat women like children when trying to flirt with them.
</p>

<p>
	Watch videos of men flirting with women.
</p>

			What you guys have said is very much true. So, then So, then why aren't nerds or other guys who are on the Autism spectrum not successful with women, even though those with autism exhibit masculine traits such as lack of expressed empathy towards others, pre-occupation with success, arrogance, and disregard for all social norms?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Autism is an over-abundance of logic. The worst think you can do to attract women is to be logical.
</p>

<p>
	The formula for being attractive to women is to be illogical, brash, confident, emotional, charismatic, playful, and socially attuned. Autistic people suck at this.
</p>

<p>
	You can be socially attuned without yet still narcissistic and breaking certain conventions selectively.
</p>

<p>
	You need to break social conventions in a cool, clued-in way, rather than a clueless, uncool, awkward, nerdy, creepy way.
</p>

<p>
	Think of the wild rockstar vs the awkward geek.
</p>

<p>
	Autistic people are too serious, and this kills your ability to attract women. Playfulness is key.
</p>

<p>
	If you look at Arnold Schwarzenegger, he is very playful, emotional, and socially attuned, but he can also kick your ass and be stoic. It's a special blend:

<p>

<p>
	Yes, well, there is always an inverse relationship between being powerful and being loved. It's hard to have both. The more points you allocate into selfishness the less people will like you, but the better your survival odds. The more points you allocate into selflessness, the more people will love you, but at the cost of your survival.

<p>
	In practice, masculinity is HIGHLY valued and respected and rewarded by society. Just don't go so toxic with it that you piss off a horde of SJWs. In practice, as a man, you can get away with some much that it's actually shocking if you try it. In most cases you actually can get away with grabbing women by the pussy. I just don't recommend doing that unless you're sure she wants you to.

<p>
	Society massively rewards aggressive, dickish, and downright sociopathic behavior in men. The world's richest and most powerful men are basically sociopaths and narcissists and they get the most and best vagina. And it has always been this way.
</p>

<p>
	But of course such men disregard all social norms and SJW narratives. They often disregard laws too.
</p>

<p>
	The reason why women are attracted to dickish behavior is because it's ruthlessly effective for survival. The woman needs a dick on her side precisely so she can be kind and sweet and innocent. She is like a king controlling an army of pawns to fight on his behalf while keeping his hands clean.

<p>
	They get objectified by society to please men. Women constantly have to feel bad for not meeting society's unrealistic beauty standards.
</p>

<p>
	You only get those extra points if you are exceptionally beautiful, which like 10% of women are. The rest are not.
</p>

<p>
	How would you feel if society gave you extra points, but only if your dick was 10 inch or longer? Otherwise you'd be made to feel like trash? And we would re-measure your dick every time you left the house.

<p>
	Time is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Like in a novel, there is no time. The sense of time is projected into the story. You can write a novel and set it in any period. Likewise Consciousness can dream up any period. Consciousness is not bound by time since it imagines it in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	Every period in history, Consciousness imagines.
</p>

<p>
	For example, the medival times did not happen long ago. They are imagined to have happened.

<p>
	You definitely have to ignore certain narratives and build yourself into a strong man.
</p>

<p>
	There is a narrative that makes men meek if they adhere to it too closely. It is a fine balancing act. Don't treat women too nicely. But also don't abuse, control, or oppress them.

	Be masculine without being toxicly masculine.

<p>
	Do women mature in their selection of men with age? Sure. They get wiser. So do men. But a big pair of tits will still be attractive.

<p>
	Reagan popularized and solidified the libertarian free-market capitalist lunacy which has been slowly eating away at the foundations of a healthy American government for the last 40 years.
</p>

<p>
	Reagan's attitude had a very corrosive influence on government and arguably led to many of the systemic issues we face today.
</p>

<p>
	Not mention the racist War On Drugs.

<p>
	Regan and Nixon were pretty bad in many ways.
</p>

<p>
	The Republican base has become so mindless, unprincipled, and regressive that anyone they are passionate about and manage to elect will be a terrible leader. Stages Blue & Orange have started to exhaust themselves like a burned up sun. And now they spew out toxic material as they resist the evolution into Green. Blue & Orange have run out of good ideas so all they're left with is an absurd clinging to their old ways, which become more and more outdated and unworkable with every decade.

	I think the real danger is not Trump but some new Trump-like figure who will try to emerge and seize hold of the foolish right-wing herd.
</p>

<p>
	The right-wing is not going away but it is going to have to mutate and adapt in the post-Trump era. It will need a new variation on the con.

	You don't need viagra to fuck a girl at your age.
</p>

<p>
	Use porn to discover what genuinely turns you on and what doesn't.

<p>
	Well, you can't gag him. But social media nor news media will be so kind to him any more.
</p>

<p>
	The media is onto his con game now.
</p>

<p>
	And the Biden admin won't allow MAGAs to storm any gov building any more.
</p>

<p>
	And he got lawsuits incoming. So I say he's cooked.

<p>
	What do you expect? Of course it's rare. Most girls want to be fucked by a strong man. You want a rare thing.
</p>

<p>
	Embrace the rareness and look for the rare.

	If they didn't make complete clowns of themselves then I would be more reasonable. But as it is now, communicating with them is impossible. Their minds have been turned to scrambled eggs by right-wing media which they themselves adore.

	Don't blame the insanity of the right on the left. They did it to themselves. To blame the left for what the right has be doing is gaslighting in its purest form.

	I don't even consider the book a branching out. The book is core to my work. My work is not about shooting videos, my work is about understanding reality, and how I express my understanding is of minor importance: video, audio, book, seminar, art, etc.

	Don't gaslight us with your BS.

<p>
	Rural Americans don't want any empathy from "coastal elites" who they themselves have demonized for the last 30 years.
</p>

<p>
	The tragedy of the situation is that Dems and progressives actually want to help rural Americans but the rural Americans are too ignorant to accept help and bite the hand that feeds them.

	I was 110% committed to fixing this area of my life. So failure and quitting was not even an option.

	Yeah, well, that's how all creativity works. You consume sources and then "the universe" gives you some spin on that.

<p>
	I don't remember it too well. I haven't used it much.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem, like with any model, is taking it too literally and using it as your exclusive paradigm for understanding reality.
</p>

<p>
	Be sure to balance it out with other models like SD, Cook-Greuter, Wilber, etc. And in the end, drop all models.

	It's pretty good. Bruce probably lifted it from studying other models and chakras and the like.

<p>
	If, for now, you can't decide between the two, then experiment with both until you become clear which one is most suitable for you.
</p>

<p>
	You can be successful in multiple mediums but that's across decades. You want to start off developing success in one. Then when you achieve that you can branch out.
</p>

<p>
	The point is not to spread yourself too thin. But your life is long enough that you can master several things.
</p>

	There is no conspiracy here. The world's top business leaders and politicians will of course collaborate on issues they see facing the future. And of course they will do so from a self-biased perspective to increase the survival of themselves, their friends, their company, and their nation.
</p>

<p>
	This is not anything new. This is how human civilization has been developing for the last 10,000 years.
</p>

<p>
	To be worried or outraged by things like this is silly.

<p>
	Why do you need someone to get you? As long as you get yourself, bask joyfully in that.
</p>

<p>
	It's not like anybody gets me. Let others be blissfully ignorant. Focus on raising your own consciousness and bliss. Cultivate inner bliss so you feel good without anyone.
</p>

<p>
	Developing a life purpose will also resolve the depression and suicidal thoughts. Besides awakening you need something productive to do with your life. You need to find a creative outlet.
</p>

<p>
	Design the kind of life you would enjoy living. Don't sit around twiddling your thumbs. At your age you've got enormous potential, you can basically become anyone you want.
</p>

			I do have a query though - although you’ve explained your absence due to illness I actually believe it was timed just prior to the election. You posted a couple of conspiracy theory videos, political views etc. (with respect very subtly exposing your views)  I’m glad you did post those at that time as you’re so smart that you knew if you posted anything after that in the last few months you could have been taken off or got a content warning.

If extroversion is more biologically attractive for females than how come guys have evolved in a way for introverts to be a thing.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not per se that extroversion is more attractive. Extroverts simply get more logistical opportunities for sex.
</p>

<p>
	The #1 key for sex to happen is logistical opportunity and bumping into new people. Introverts bump into far fewer new people than extroverts. So o course they will have less sexual opportunities. It's just basic logistics. You can't get laid sitting at home reading books. To get laid a lot you need to go to parties and social events. Which introverts don't enjoy going to.

			If introverts are not desirable for a girl attraction wise then they would have been wiped out or not even evolve to a thing at the first place. I think what females desire in a man is strength and that can be even if you are not extroverted.  Strength is what allows you to protect, defend and dominate. Extroversion can help with that since we are a social species but at the core it is strength that they desire the most. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Correct me if i am wrong. I have seen more laid back, chill and relaxed kind of guys with introverted vibes be very successful with girls naturally.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You act as though I said introverts can't get laid. That's not what I said. I simply said they get laid less.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that you don't need to get laid a lot with many people to have children and reproduce.
</p>

<p>
	Also, introverts can be very good at getting laid through other means. For example, many introverts become successful businessmen who then just buy as much sex as they want.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I could leverage my introversion to buy a lot of sex if I wanted to. Remember, for most of human history sex was traded and acquired through wealth and power, not pickup at nightclubs or Tinder.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate way to get laid is through power. Consider Genghis Khan.

Hell, I am sure that there a lot of women can’t stand or are turned off by arrogant loud mouthed schmucks like Trump.

<p>
	Doesn't matter. That kind of polarization only increases your results with girls. A highly polarizing obnoxious ass like Trump will be hated by 33% of girls, but about 33% will love him. Girls who hate him will really hate him. Girls who love him will really love him. At least at first, before they learn how much of toxic devil he is. Eventually 100% of girls will hate him <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />

<p>
	That's nice in theory but doesn't work in practice. You need to be social to get laid a lot.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can still get laid being quiet. You'll get just laid less relative to someone who's more active.

<p>
	I'm not too worried about that. They can easily adjust the vaccines now for new variants.
</p>

<p>
	The hard part was the proof of concept for rapid and safe vaccine development using mRNA. They mastered that. I'm sure they will make even better vaccines soon. And we are developing our logistics and distribution platforms too, so things will never be as bad as they were.
</p>

<p>
	Really, we need something like a mail-home vaccine DIY kit. For hyper-rapid distribution when as new virus appears. Going to the doctor to get a vaccine is silly.
</p>

<p>
	Really this covid was needed to future-proof ourselves against other, more deadly viruses. Now we will be much better prepared. So it's a net positive.

<p>
	Osho was a playboy. He probably banged 3 new groupies every night. He certainly didn't transcend or master sexual desire. He indulged it like a rockstar.
</p>

<p>
	If I did that, you guys would call me a devil cult leader charlatan.

			I would say spiritual masters are in a unique environment. Their stature may allow for younger women to be attracted to them. And the spiritual master may be able to get away with it without much consequence. That is very different than 60+ men living in a Florida retirement home that doesn't encounter or attract many women. And different than a 60+ college professor that is around a lot of younger women, yet would face serious consequences if he slept with one. 
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course hormones play a role. But that's not really fair either. Yeah, it's easy to "transcend" sexual desire by cutting your balls off. But that's not really a transcendence of desire, that's just tuning your body to stop producing the desire. That's like saying I have transcend my desire for dick -- simply by virtue of the fact that I wasn't born gay. By that logic I am a master of transcending the desire for dick. It never even arises for me. But do I really deserve credit for that?
</p>

<p>
	And furthermore, to say that one has transcended sexual desire simply because one has no sexual opportunities, is also a kind of cheat. The real test is when a hot girl rubs her ass in your lap and you are still able to say no.

<p>
	It's a complex situation. I don't think they are all full of shit. But you definitely cannot just blindly trust everything they claim. Such people tend to be highly fantastical and imaginative as a personality trait. So they can imagine a lot of stuff which may not be "objectively real".

<p>
	Heavy metals do seem to cause autism in young children. But these new vaccines don't have heavy metals from what I've read and as an adult with a fully developed brain and body your situation is very different than that of young children. And you must weigh against the risk of the disease the vaccine protects you from. And you can chelate heavy metals fairly easily so it is not a permanent thing.
</p>

<p>
	So the case against covid vaccines for adults is not good. And they haven't even approved covid vaccines for kids yet.
</p>

<p>
	This is not the case.
</p>

<p>
	Most of my advice pertains to the relative domain. In your case of dealing with these healers, I'm telling you to be careful precisely for relative reasons. They can give you bad/wrong advice and you just trust them and ruin your life.
</p>

<p>
	In dealing with some of these spiritual healer type people I have found many of them to be full of shit and it would be very foolish to entrust important life decisions to them. I'm not saying it's all bad, but you gotta be skeptical of things they say because they say some bullshit that will directly contradict other spiritual healers.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I went to a top rated spiritual healer last year and asked her specifically about my health problems. She told me there is absolutely nothing wrong with my body. At first I believed her. Then I did medical testing and found out otherwise, and conclusively proved to myself that she was full of shit as I started taking medicine and feeling much better.
</p>

<p>
	Now, will she ever admit her mistake? Never. She's too high on her own spiritual bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	So from now on any time someone tells me they are a spiritual healer, I will look at them like they are an idiot. And in questioning these healers deeply I can see they are not awake, they are playing sophisticated games of self-deception and imagination.
</p>

	Children already have vaccine "passports". It's called school. You can't go to school without proper vaccine. Boo-hoo. That's the cost of moving around in a herd.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to fly around it is not too much to ask that you get a vaccine from a mutating pandemic that already killed millions.
</p>

<p>
	You libertarian types are too paranoid. No one is gonna control you with a vaccine. It's just basic public health and it costs you little to comply. Vaccine is far safer than covid so you'd be a fool not to take it. And it costs so little.
</p>

<p>
	From what I understand these new vaccines do not contain mercury, so your case against them drops to nill.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's tricky to say. I don't know exactly. Some people get stuck chasing the same desire endlessly forever.
</p>

<p>
	I think it probably involves experiencing enough of it that you get sick of it and are ready to move on to higher things. It also requires exploration of higher joys.
</p>

<p>
	I feel like I have almost extinguished my desire for junk food. It used to be so hard to say no, now it is almost effortless. And I had a lot of junk food in the past, but it caused me so much suffering I don't want it any more.
</p>

<p>
	Lower desires tend to bring a lot of suffering which you can use against them. But it requires going through that suffering. Play so much video games that you are disgusted with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It certainly helps a lot when you discover higher spiritual dimensions to life. You can use spiritual joy to replace the seeking of base cravings and raw pleasure.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is still a desire I have not figured out. It's so powerful and intoxicating. I see few spiritual masters have conquered it even in their 60s.
</p>

<p>
	If you are Infinite Consciousness, imagining a hell is just part of your game. God is an infinite dream, so it will have some dark corners, as your human dreams do.
</p>

<p>
	I've had some dreams which were borderline hell. I've experienced a sort of hyper-hell, which is hell in more than 3 dimensions. It is not a fun place. It will make you forget that love exists.

			It's normal when you have a relatively good job. If you're an engineer at Amazon you'll get generous bonuses and shares as well. Which makes sense because engineers provide a lot of value to Amazon. If you're not providing much value don't complain people don't want to share profits with you.

<p>
	The notion that stock options and bonuses go to the ones providing most value is laughable. They go to the most powerful.

<p>
	Best way I have found to transcend desires is to deeply satisfy them.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you can of course abstain from cravings and desires. But that rarely extinguishes them. They tend to come back.

<p>
	Sounds nice in theory but it just isn't true.
</p>

<p>
	You hunger will not go away from doing the work, but when your belly is filled.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, you will feel better about yourself if you stop procrastinating and start taking action towards solving your desire. But that doesn't satisfy the desire itself. At least not in the basic cases of hunger, sex, etc. Maybe in some very high level cases that could work.
</p>

<p>
	But a desire for sex will not be satisfied by anything other than sex. Or simply by letting the desire go entirely. But it will come back! You can't let go of sex so easily.

He was talking about presenting a strong rhetorical case more than a focus on facts or data. Which is how you persuade people.
</p>

<p>
	The entire reason right-wing media is so persuasive is because they focus on culture war emotional issues. It has nothing to do with truth, facts, data, or policy. The average rube does not care about anything but emotional appeals.

<p>
	Certainly not. This is not what is being proposed. We are talking about employees. And even then, we are not talking about giving away control but about profit distribution. A CEO would still have most say and control over a company. The janitor at Amazon is not going to make executive business decisions. But he will get a nice salary if the company is successful.
</p>

<p>
	I would also make exceptions for small businesses. If a business has less than 20 or 50 employees, then it will not be regulated as strictly and there will be less or no requirements for significant profit sharing since such businesses have far less social responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org is not buying politicians, etc.

	Investing and loans do have some legit role. The problem is that in today's market they are WAY out of healthy proportion.

<p>
	A hell realm is not for no reason. It's there for the reason that God/YOU wanted to experience it. It's part of Love.
</p>

<p>
	A hell realm is just a bad dream. God dreams infinite dreams, so what is a hell realm to him? Just like a bit of daydreaming to you. Does it bother you when you get a stray daydream? No. It's just a natural function of your mind. You never ask, "But why was I cursed with that evil daydream?"

<p>
	No. People would simply never accept it so why bother trying to convince them?

	If you showed people levitation, half of them would think you're a fraud/cult leader, half would think you're Satan and want to kill you, and half would start to worship you like blind monkeys.

			Of course. Have you ever worked for a company with a falling share price? It's shit. They pay shit, treat employees poorly, layoff people and all kinds of exciting projects get cancelled. So, even when you're not seeding a startup, it's still very important for the company.

<p>
	Have you heard of Amazon? Their stock prices are soaring yet they still treat their employees like shit.
</p>

<p>
	Look, I'm not saying a serious investor shouldn't get some return on his investment. But a billion times return like today's CEO's? Hell no.
</p>

<p>
	You could cut returns by 95% and things would still be fine. Take Jeffo Bezo's returns down from $200 billion to $50 million. Give the rest to the laborers who do the actual labor. Likewise for all major corporations. There will still be rich CEOs and investors, just not insanely rich. Cap income at $50 mil and the world will be a better place. There is no reason why anyone should hold over $50 mil no matter how many companies they start. If they don't want to work after $50 mil, fuck them. Let them retire. But such people will choose to work anyway because they can't stand retirement, so nothing will be lost.

If you say YES, then you tell me how we should change the system to make it less leechy.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course everything is subjective. Objectivity does not exist in my worldview.
</p>

<p>
	In this case value is simply whatever mankind finds valuable or desirable. Whatever helps mankind's survival. Value basically = survival. And all survival is relative. But human survival has many common features such as food, water, sex, land, housing, cars, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Middlemen and resellers, for example, add very little value to the world, thus they are often made disposable by nature. Anything in nature that adds little value eventually gets killed off.
</p>

<p>
	For example, kings got killed off because they didn't add sufficient value to society. They mostly leeched value.
</p>

		<p>
			Leo, you often say that you need to be creative to succeed on market and in life. Can you please elaborate - what do you mean by being creative?
		</p>

		<p>
			Does it mean to provide value to people, like, being productive and useful?
		</p>

		<p>
			Does it mean to create something new that did not exist before (find new solution, create new product, new approach, new method, new kind of service)?
		</p>

		<p>
			Or is it a mindset when you are focused on doing something for your authentic reasons?
		</p>

		<p>
			What do you mean by "being creative"?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, creativity is a deep topic. Creativity has many degrees to it.
</p>

<p>
	For the purposes of this thread my definition of creativity is quite a low bar. Just basically any kind of labor that you do which generates value in and of itself without stealing another's labor.
</p>

<p>
	In this case, getting paid to pick strawberries is creative work while getting paid on your shares of ownership of the strawberry company is not creative work, it is leeching value because the core value of the company comes from the strawberry pickers rather than the stock holders. You can easily tell that because if we kill the strawberry pickers the company will not be profitable, but if we kill the stockholders the company will still be just as profitable.
</p>

<p>
	In general our society should be structured such that people who do the most labor get the most rewards. Today it is the other way around. The most rewards go to people who often do literally zero labor. And daytrading is not labor.
</p>

<p>
	See, this is buy design. It's basically a remnant of slavery. Under slavery, the guys who do the most labor get paid zero while the guys who do zero labor get paid everything. And then those guys who get paid everything have the gall to say that they are actually doing labor by whipping the slaves to work.
</p>

<p>
	That is still effectively our system, just abstracted a bit. And most people are in denial about it. Especially those who profit from it.
</p>

<p>
	Ain't it sweet to make money for doing nothing while others slave away?
</p>

<p>
	The big oversight that people like this make is confusing truth with persuasion.
</p>

<p>
	Truth has little to do with persuasion, and what these YT debaters are doing is playing persuasion games. Debate is not a valid method of accessing truth.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something sounds persuasive or reasonable does not make it true.

			Still not clear on this. If someone claims that they can levitate, isn't the notion of 'evidence' is very simple? That I (or other third-party auditors) can literally see the person levitate, that's it. If the guy can float in the air, cool, film it, have 100 scientists observe real-time and upload it to YouTube or something, and rake in the million dollars like Carl mentioned. I'm not a materialist btw, I'm just confused as to why this hasn't happened yet.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Oh, that's very easy to answer.
</p>

<p>
	If someone posted a video of actual, genuine levitation on YT, your mind would simply never believe it to be real. You would call it a hoax.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind will not accept that which runs counter to its deepest metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	You can't get 100 scientists to observe it in real time because no serious scientist would believe it enough to even buy a plane ticket to see it for himself. And even if they did, you would just dismiss those scientists are deluded kooks -- not real scientists, because only a kook would buy a plane ticket to see levitation -- obviously.
</p>

<p>
	So how can you prove something which you know isn't real?
</p>

<p>
	You see? You have shut your eyes and complain that you cannot see and yet you ask us to help you. No one can help you in this case until your realize you are actively shutting your eyes on purpose.

<p>
	That's on you.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to understand EVERYTHING, it would be a good way to do it, rather than this pointless mental masturbation you're currently doing here.
</p>

<p>
	But if you find tripping nightmarish then maybe you're not ready to know EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
	See, you ask to know EVERYTHING, but then you recoil in horror and run away. So God himself cannot please you.

<p>
	Take a look at how numbers work. Numbers are infinitely finite. Each number is finite yet there are infinitely many of them, and you can sub-divide each finite number an infinite number of times more, and each of those you can also sub-divide infinite more times, ad infinitum.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is a highly paradoxical thing. Contradiction is not a bug, it's a feature. If thinking about infinity breaks your mind, that's not a mistake, that's the nature of infinity!
</p>

<p>
	Infinity creates a lot of paradox and breaks all finite systems, which is why scientists tend to avoid it and sweep it under the rug. When a physicist encounters an infinity in his calculations/equations he considers it a mistake and looks for a way to hide it. But of course the only mistake is him thinking it was a mistake and trying to hide it.

<p>
	The problem goes way deeper than that. The problem is in how your mind defines "evidence" and "proof". These are not simple notions, these notions are relative to one's metaphysical and epistemic paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that a materialistic paradigm does not have a robust and subtle enough notion of "evidence" and "proof" to accomodate paranormal phenomena, therefore it is blind to them and says they can't exist.
</p>

	Color can't exist for one who super-glued his eyelids shut.

<p>
	There would also be nothing to stop nothing from creating something.
</p>

<p>
	All things are just imaginations of consciousness. You're still stuck in materialism.
</p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating the relativity of things. Stop assuming that things exist as objective facts. They don't. They only exist if your consciousness holds them.
</p>

<p>
	Even the notion of a "thing" or an object is merely something you dreamed up. If you stop dreaming of objects there will be no objects. Reality is not made out of objects nor is reality as a whole an object itself.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because duality is a part of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	There is possibility for EVERYTHING because reality is unlimited. So what would stop it?
</p>

<p>
	A more conventional explanation would sound like this: nothing cannot stop something from appearing, since to stop a thing requires something to exist. Hence something must come into existence because nothing prevents it.
</p>

<p>
	But even this explanation is not correct because it still assumes a duality between nothing and something. As if something came out of nothing. NO! Something did not come out of nothing. Something has always been nothing. The only full explanation is that something = nothing.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't get it, it's because you haven't awoken to the fact that everything you see and hear is nothing. And no amount of logicking this will do it.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot substitute for lack of awakening by thinking some more.

	You probably just lack experience. Socialization requires lots of experience, so hatch a plan to gain massive experience. The solution here is pretty simple but you must do it to get results. You can't fix this problem sitting on your couch thinking about it.

<p>
	I used to have horrible social anxiety. Lots of experience solved it.

<p>
	The purpose is to underscore the entitlement and wrong expectation of life to be easy and served up to you on silver platter.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing personal. But you guys gotta toughen up.
</p>

<p>
	Your grandparents where shot at in WWII, and you are complaining about how boring a book is. And you expect me to coddle you on this? Embrace the challenges of self-development.

<p>
	Kids these days expect everything to be easy.

Reframe it more as socialization rather than trying to sell yourself. And enjoy the process.
</p>

<p>
	The bottom line is that you cannot get laid unless you socialize somehow. How you do it is up to you.

<p>
	All survival/life is by definition finite and scarcity-based.
</p>

<p>
	For you to have a puppy means that someone else does not get to have that puppy. No way around this.
</p>

<p>
	Even your preference to live in a democracy is an infringement on someone else's preference to live in a fascist state. The two are mutually exclusive.
</p>

<p>
	Hence life is always full of conflict.

<p>
	A) What you consider creative is too limited. Being creative is not just about being an artist.
</p>

<p>
	B) What I am saying is personal advice. It is not meant to be a solution that fixes the whole world overnight. Yes, if you live in Iraq you will have a hard time being creative.
</p>

<p>
	You need to distinguish between personal advice vs public policy.

<p>
	Don't get me wrong, you can certainly make enormous money by stealing and leeching. But don't be shocked when you try to leech but you get leeched instead.
</p>

<p>
	By being a leech you enter a battle of leech against leech and who gets outleeched is up for grabs.
</p>

<p>
	See, leeching is a finite process whereas creativity is an infinite process. You'd be a fool to align yourself with the finite instead of the infinite.

	BTW, it may shock you guys, but I may buy some stocks in the future. The only difference is that: A) I don't bullshit myself about the fact that it is leeching, and B) I don't use it as a substitute for my creative work.
</p>

<p>
	The worst thing is when you get the idea that stocks are the way for you to get rich.
</p>

<p>
	For me stocks are mostly an inflation hedge. I'm not looking to get rich off trading them.

If you are attracting unloving girls, there's something weird in your way of attracting them. Diversify your source and be mindful of how you're rejecting loving girls. You can also develop screening questions to screen out unloving girls.
</p>

<p>
	SCREEN your girls before you sleep with them! Say NO to girls who don't fit your standards. Have high standards. Cure your neediness. Set boundaries.

	Yes, it's a self-reinforcing reality bubble that the mind constructs and maintains. Structurally no different than religion or a conspiracy theory. They're all constructed reality bubbles.

<title>Is the pursuit of enlightenment a self-bias?</title>

<p>
	Strictly-speaking, the valuing of enlightenment over non-enlightenment is a bias. God doesn't really care whether it's enlightened or not.
</p>

<p>
	But of all the biases one can have, this one you should worry least about.

	It is the height of arrogance to think you have a design that will work better and be more fair than a market.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever kind of alt-economy you imagine, I guarantee it will be more evil than what we currently got. Because at least markets have been evolving for thousand of years. While your genius plan has never been tested and wouldn't even work for one month without being massively exploited by devils.

	Don't kid yourself. Plenty of people who trade stock think that. Plenty of them on this forum. Which is why we're having this debate in the first place. BitCoin traders too.

<p>
	1) Sounds like you are way too needy.
</p>

<p>
	2) Two girls is nothing. Statistically insignificant. Go find more and better. Not all girls are like that.
</p>

<p>
	Cure your neediness, become a strong attractive man, and you will find many sweet girls who will love you and bend over backwards for you.
</p>

<p>
	I've never had a problem finding loving girls. That's like the least problem with girls. If the girls you're with are unloving you got something weird going on. You are probably attracting that kind.

<p>
	Yes, I have a high bar for "creating value". This is not some absolute thing. I am trying to upgrade your standards as a creator. If you actually follow my advice and say No to the devil's honey, then you will come out richer than if you were trading stonks.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking you are a creator by trading stocks is just a joke. That's like thinking you are a saint for holding the door open for an old lady.

<p>
	That's a cute story. But in reality what you're doing is leeching value from the workers who are being creative. It's not like you're funding some start-up in a garage here. You're funneling money to giant companies who don't need your money other than to pay their executives billions.

<p>
	Having money in a bank account does not leech value from creative workers because you don't earn anything significant on it.
</p>

<p>
	The key is this: if you're earning a lot by doing nothing, you're leeching. Where do you think that money is coming from? It's not coming from thin air and you aren't creating it. Someone else is creating it and you're siphoning it off.

			Would you consider venture capital exploitative? Venture capital allows smart people to build huge companies quickly which they would never be able to bootstrap.

<p>
	Yes, it's very exploitative. But also, early venture capital is more creative than what you're doing by trading stocks on Wall Street.

<p>
	Some amount of capital lending will always be necessary and good. The problem is when you start trading it for profit by adding nothing. When you buy stocks of Microsoft or Coca Cola, you're not really seeding them with capital. You're just trading and leeching.

<p>
	It's not about learning investing. You have to look at the entire economic system as a pyramid scheme that funnels exploited value upward to those who do not work.
</p>

<p>
	Our system was deliberately designed so that those who work the least get to take the value of those who work the most. This is otherwise known as theft. You are complicit in this system when you feed money into it and get value out of it. If you don't understand the devilry of this design you are gullible.
