<p>
	What you're asking is, should I love myself or hate myself? Either way is fine. Up to you.

			I haven't tried 5-MeO yet, but I had an experience on DPT of what I would call complete ego death, beyond senses, time and space, the most humbling experience I've ever had. The moment after I came back it felt extremely true. Until I will try 5-MeO, I can't claim it was the same. Reaching absolute infinity through meditation and confirming or denying whether it's the same or different from 5-MeO, this curiosity is something that has motivated me for the last year to do very heavy Samatha practice and I'm not that far away from equanimity stage where I will be able to access it, I think 3 months left max.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course is does! Buddhism can get very dogmatic and religious. Which is why we're having this conversation.
</p>

<p>
	It's dangerous to assume that Buddhism is somehow pure and immune from dogma or corruption.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, I would venture a bet that the majority of Buddhists are dogmatic and corrupt.
</p>

<p>
	No one and no thing in this work can be trusted. All authority is delusion. Direct experience is the only source of Truth.

			the mind makes things exclusionary and dogmatic. The teaching points to the truth, you know this already so I don’t know why your framing in this sense. Anything can be made to be what you say, even non duality, way as no way etc. The truth is the truth regardless of the pointer. Don’t you agree?

<p>
	That's overly simplistic and naive.
</p>

<p>
	Not all teachings are the same. Not all pointers are the same.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, the mind can corrupt even the bestest of teachings, but many teachings are already fundamentally corrupt and dogmatic to begin with, and do not encourage integral thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Integral teachings are rare.

<p>
	Because after enlightenment, you are gone, dead. You surrendered your entire life.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard for a dead man to suffer since suffering is the avoidance of death.

<p>
	Once you are infinite, nothing can harm you. The body can die and it does not bother you.

<title>Is Buddhism A Viable Solution To Happiness?</title>

<p>
	There is a lot of wisdom within Buddhism. The problem though is turning it into a dogma or believing it without direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	No teacher, no teaching can be trusted in this work. Because you do not know what is true or who is true.
</p>

<p>
	You must independently verify every teaching and cross-reference it against other sources.
</p>

<p>
	There are also many different kinds of Buddhism, so how do you know which one to follow, which one is true? You don't and can't without independent verification
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You cannot possibly be as excellent as you think because you are too lazy to develop skills.

<p>
	I have read it. Just at a high level.
</p>

<p>
	My mind grasps things holistically. It does not need to go through logical steps or formal proofs.
</p>

<p>
	I had understood the essence of Godel's discovery before I even knew Godel existed. Epistemically, the map can never be the territory. Truth cannot be symbolized. It is really obvious that no formal logical system could ever encapsulate the Truth due to the problem of self-reference. Godel intuited this too. Then he formally proved it. Godel intuited the truth of his proof before he created the proof.

<p>
	Mental illness can happen at any stage. But more common at lower stages simply because it's hard to get to a high stage with an unresolved mental illness.
</p>

<p>
	Most mental illness can be healed. It usually requires doing the right inner work which people are not taught how to do.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't really make sense to me how a mental illness will survive deep consciousness work unless you got some physical brain injury.

		<p>
			Would the question, "what is not reality" be a valid one?  
		</p>

		<p>
			I suppose the answer is: nothing.  But what is a nothing? The moment you ask that question, you can no longer be asking about nothing, because it would be a something. And a something can only be in reality.

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	Reality has no opposite. Because its all-inclusiveness leaves no room for anything else.

<p>
	If they are paying your bills, it might be wise to just accept some of those simple compromises like not buying pork or alcohol.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are paying for yourself you can buy whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	Freedom has to be earned.
</p>

<p>
	You could also tell them that you are pursuing spirituality/Allah directly, in accordance with nondual Sufi ways and the spirit of Islam (surrender to Allah). Muhammad was into meditation.
</p>

<p>
	If you are pursuing nonduality, the irony is that you are more Muslim than they are. But don't tell them that <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

			I agree philosophy spawns all but how can you deny mathematicians are more intelligent than other people? I have known my mathematician friend for 10 years and he's not only good at math but also very good at analyzing situation and critical thinking. He's emotionally grounded. Of course intelligence as you say is irreducible and I'm not saying because he's good at math he's good at everything. Hell NO, but math and IT is really the standard to measure one's intelligence.
		</p>
	</div>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Why would math be a measure of intelligence? You only think that because your culture brainwashed you with this idea that math has high value.
</p>

<p>
	I am pretty bad at math. It is my weakest subject. But I am more intelligent than the world's best mathematicians.
</p>

<p>
	Because my mind is super open, flexible, creative, and intuitive. And because I think integrally, holisitically, metaphysically, and I understand the value of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I once tried to explain Absolute Infinity to a university math professor. He didn't get it.
</p>

<p>
	I will take my mind over a mathematician's mind any day.
</p>

<p>
	Show me one mathematician who has cognized infinite intelligence. They basically don't exist.

<p>
	Anything you posit that created reality must, by definition, be part of reality, becauase reality is everything that is.
</p>

<p>
	Reality could only have created itself because there is nothing outside reality.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing outside infinity. Inside/outside is a relative duality. Infinity does not have an inside and outside. It just is.
</p>

<p>
	You CAN have it both ways! That's the nature of Infinity and nonduality! It is includes all opposites.

</p>

<p>
	For example, why can't you teach yourself some valuable skills, like web programming, move out on your own to a cheap state like Nevada or Texas and work for a few years to build up a nest egg?
</p>

<p>
	Then you can go monk.
</p>

<p>
	If you recall, Om Swami worked his ass off for 10 years in business before he went full monk.
</p>

<p>
	You sound very young, so you got plenty of time to do both.
</p>

<p>
	You also don't need to go full monk to pursue enlightenment. With Kriya yoga and psychedelics you can make enormous progress quickly while still working a regular job.
</p>

<p>
	By the time you are done building up your nest egg you could already be half-enlightened.

<p>
	That is correct. Ego requires an activated default mode network which is deactivated by psychedelics. Ego is an active construction. The default state is Infinity.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics deactivate certain portions of the brain and interconnect others. This is sort of like unseating a tyrant and installing a widely distributed democracy.

	Well, they obvious had some kind of financial backing, from parents or whatever. Tickets to India don't pay for themselves.

<p>
	There do exist ashrams/monasteries around the world which are free. Which basically means you live there and work for them.

<p>
	Osho's commune had people paying him tons of money to be there. Sometimes giving up their entire life savings.

<p>
	You gotta be careful. Sometimes these ashrams/communes will leech your money or can even be actual cults.
</p>

<p>
	When cash is low, you can get creative. For example, your cash will go much further in India or South East Asia than in Costa Rica. Then again, you tend to get what you pay for. There are lots of shitty places in India.

Robert Monroe's books are good. Thomas Campbell talks a lot about astral projection too.
</p>

<p>
	I have never had a proper OBE. I've had sleep paralysis a couple of times, but it was very short and I never made much sense out of it. For me they are extremely rare. My guess is, I don't have the right type of brain/pysche for it.

<title>Income in Turqoise Communities Advice?</title>

</p>

<p>
	In the end, you cannot run away from solving the career/job problem. This is the entire problem of survival. You can't just expect someone else to solve this problem for you. This is a huge thing. This is what my LP Course is for. There is no quick fix solution to survival.
</p>

<p>
	If you had a decent job you could save up money.
</p>

<p>
	If you had a decent business you could live off passive income.
</p>

<p>
	If you had highly valuable skills you could offer those for trade.
</p>

<p>
	But all of that takes years to establish.
</p>

<p>
	Ashrams are not a cure-all for life and in some ways they can be a trap. Once you're there with no money and no exit strategy, you're stuck.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot expect to just live your whole life mooching off of others. What value are you going to offer the world? Answering this question is not really optional. By not answering the question your answer is the default: nothing. Which means, don't expect much in return from the world.
</p>

<p>
	You only get what you give.
</p>

<p>
	To escape wage slavery you must become a massive value provider, or rob a bank.
</p>

<title>A Strange Experience</title>

What is your intention?
</p>

<p>
	Perhaps rather than just having them accost you randomly, you could infuse some intention into it.
</p>

<p>
	You can choose to infuse infinite love into whatever experience you are having. Evil entities and whatnot should not bother you if you tap into the power of infinite love. You can even say something like, "Be gone devils! I reject your evil ways in the name of love."
</p>

<p>
	All of these astral realm type experiences are what is called the Subtle body. Which is basically the dream realm.
</p>

<p>
	Visualize yourself tapping into infinite love right before bed every night to program your mind to do it when you're in one of these OBE's.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, take ownership of your OBE's. Don't let them turn you into a helpless victim. Don't let evil push you around. Truth and love conquers all.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When I call someone a devil that's very different than when a dualist/moralist calls someone a devil. When I use the label "devil" it is not a personal or moral judgment. It is a matter-of-fact pointing out of unconscious selfishness. When I use the word I understand that the devil is actually God. Most people do not.
</p>

<p>
	That is the difference between dualistic and nondual understanding.
</p>

<p>
	The dualist really feels that evil is real.
</p>

<p>
	The nondualist is conscious that evil is really impossible.
</p>

<p>
	That's because logic is dualistic and reality is nondual.
</p>

<p>
	It is ONLY possible to be deliberately evil while being unconscious.

<p>
	Go outside and try to crush an ant with your finger while you are simultaneously conscious of the ant's subjective state of mind, it's connection to the entire ecosystem, to the fact that you are the ant, and the ant's inherent beauty. And see what happens.

And ego, even when it is being Machiavellian and deliberately exploitative, is still deeply unconscious and foolish. There certainly are evil, exploitative people in the world. But they are fundamentally ignorant. Which is why they are evil.
</p>

<p>
	Like Trump and his cronies. They are rigging the system. But they are all deeply ignorant.
</p>

<p>
	That what selfishness is! Ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	Ego is not really a personal thing, it is a force of nature. And in this sense, it's all part of the structure and unfolding of the universe. Evil people cannot help but be evil because they are ignorant.

</p>

<p>
	It's not that enlightened people are lazy, it's that unenlightened people are deluded. Deluded people do foolish things, like competing, because they are not wise enough to see it is delusion.
</p>

<p>
	You are a mouse running in wheel chasing an imaginary piece of cheese. When someone comes along and points this out to you, you say, "But if I stop I will just be a lazy mouse who sits still. I must keep running until I'm dead."
</p>

<p>
	That is the tragedy of your predicament. You are so mesmerized by life that you refuse to stop and question it. "No time to stop, I've got important cheese to chase."
</p>

<p>
	You are creating a false dichotomy between being enlightened vs working. You can do both and in fact enlightenment will make you extremely effective at anything you choose to do. The best scientists will be enlightened ones.

<p>
	Spiral Dynamics is not a measure of nonduality. It is a measure of cognitive, emotional, moral, and cultural development.
</p>

<p>
	This  a very important distinction.
</p>

<p>
	You can be fully nondual but still at a low level of development. Development is distinct from states of consciousness and you are not going to attain a high level of development merely by sitting on a cushion.

	The issue is HOW. What is the proper way for mankind to survive?

<p>
	Every stage of the Spiral is trying to survive, in its own way, blind to all other ways above it.

<p>
	JP's stage Blue & Orange political solutions are a no-go. His notions of order will actually create more disorder. Because he is not aware of the deeper egoic dynamics which are running the show.

I have heard from people that it worked for them. It really depends on the person. Seems like it works best on people who are already close to awakening. It doesn't work so well on random Joe Shmo off the street corner.
</p>

<p>
	I even scheduled a Shaktipat session once. But then I refused it at the last minute because my purpose was to prove out 5-MeO-DMT and Kriya yoga for the benefit of others. God indeed works in mysterious ways. I do not regret it. I will take 5-MeO over Shaktipat.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with Shaktipat is that you are giving all of your power away to someone else. This is a strategic blunder in my book. What happens when it does not take you all the way? You need more reliable tools. Try it, but have a solid practice in place.

</p>

<p>
	If you don't like living, you are welcome to exit this ride at any time. But the rest of us want some semblance of decent and effective government.

<p>
	Hoping to escape the present moment into the next happy one isn't happiness, it's hell.

	"The prophet Mohammed, who, when one day he saw a Bedouin leaving his camel without tethering it, questioned him as to why he was doing this. The Bedouin replied that he was placing his trust in Allah and had no need to tie the camel. The prophet Mohammed then replied, 'Tie your camel and place your trust in Allah.' "
</p>

<p>
	Politics is the domain of survival. If I was to drive a dump truck full of toxic chemicals to your house and dump it on your front lawn, you would not say, "Okay, no problem. It's perfect." You would say, "No! This should be against the law. Stop polluting my lawn." And thus regulation was born.
</p>

<p>
	"Trust in God, but tie your camel."
</p>

<p>
	Another illustrative story:
</p>

<p>
	A holy man fell off the side of a large ship and was drowning in the sea. He started to pray for God to save him. Over and over again the crew tossed out life preservers to the drowning man, but over and over again he refused because his faith was so strong that he knew God would save him. Finally he drowned. When he arrived in Heaven he saw God and started yelling at him: "I was your most faithful servant! Why didn't you save me from drowning?!!!" And God replied, "I threw you the life preserver over and over again."

An enormous amount of evolutionary development has happened in the last 2000 years of human civilization.
</p>

<p>
	Your view of evolution is very materialist and limited.
</p>

<p>
	Evolution is NOT a biological process happening through DNA. Evolution is a universal process happening through every single movement of every molecule through every scale of order, from the subatomic to cellular to the cultural to the galactic.
</p>

<p>
	You grossly underestimate how much reality has changed in the last 10,000 years and are taking many evolutionary developments completely for granted, like the invention of mathematics, science, language, history, psychology, biology, logic, government, laws, human rights, education, housing, etc. None of these things were a given. They all had to evolve through lots of conflict and struggle.
</p>

<p>
	The human race has solved billions of problems. Which is why you can sit there and enjoy a life of non-slavery, or why you even think you are a biological organism. You are taking your current Spiral stage completely for granted. As if humans like you were just born 10,000 years ago.
</p>

<p>
	Life does not stand still! Evolution is at work, and it has a particular direction: towards increasing consciousness. Life is not some random accident. In the next 1000 years human society will change so radically it will be unrecognizable and horrifying to most egos. Luckily, they'll be long dead.

<p>
	Consider the possibility that actual vs not-actual is a conceptual duality you created.
</p>

<p>
	What is this thing you call "actual"? Are you actual?
</p>

<p>
	What is the difference between an actual demon and a non-actual demon?

<p>
	Reality is one system. There is nothing to check it but itself.
</p>

<p>
	The only check to pathological government is healthy government. There both is and is not a check on government. Government is the result of egos enslaving other egos, but then softened by egos voting to make the government more healthy. It's a complex strange loop. Once you are assimilated, you have some say in how the super-organism should work.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, order and disorder, freedom and regulation are the yin-yang. That is the dualistic play of God.
</p>

<p>
	We need to not only check the small egos, we need to check the large corporate egos. Without regulation there will be corporate enslavement. This is already the case. The problem with corporations, unlike individual humans, is that I'm not sure how conscious they can be. A human can become enlightened or at least do spiritual practice. A human has a conscience and sense of morality. A corporation... not so much. At least not in their current configuration.
</p>

<p>
	Corporations make this whole game more tricky because there are 4 entities now within this super-organism: humans, corporations, local governments, and national governments. All 4 need to figure out a way to play together nicely. And then there is global governance of all nations to be considered. The challenge is how to best integrate them all. There are no easy black and white answers. The solutions are nuanced, complex, and really a topic for scientific research.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that stage Blue/Orange people have very simplistic answers which will not possibly work -- they have already run their course. Stage Green is much better, but still not integral enough. Stage Yellow is what we really need most urgently, but to get to Yellow, we need more people at Green.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	High quality science-based regulation is exactly the solution. We regulate those parts of society which behave too egotistically and are hurting the whole.
</p>

<p>
	Government is an agreement between people to regulate each other for the good of all. That's what government is! The answer to bad government is always better, more scientific, more precise government. Not less government. Government must grow as the complexity of the human super-organism grows.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot have a highly complex organism (human society) without strict rules and regulations. Regulations actually enable high degrees of complexity. You cannot have a human body if each cell says "Fuck you, regulation is bad, freedom!" Then you have chaos.
</p>

<p>
	Freedom IS chaos! Order is regulation.
</p>

<p>
	What people do not understand is that humans are not individuals, we are a hive mind and all future forms of the human super-organism will involve higher and higher degrees of integration until eventually there will not be human individuals are all! It will be one collective mind integrating human brains with super AI and all kinds of other technology into one giant mega-conscious integral super-organism. For that to happen, you gotta get over yourself.
</p>

<p>
	This is not about you. This is about YOU! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	In the end, you will be assimilated, over your cold body if necessary. Because that is what evolution is. It integrates, then sub-framents, then integrates, then sub-fragments like a fractual to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	You have no choice about any of this. It will happen whether you resist it or not. The ego always loses.
</p>

<p>
	JP and his egotistical followers will all be integrated in the end.
</p>

<p>
	He is not so innocent. He's polarizing people against Green. If all he did was help elevate low Blue to high Blue that would not be a problem. But what he is doing is entrenching Blue deeper into Blue by giving them an out-group to hate: Green.
</p>

<p>
	JP demonizes Green to gain the love and money of Blue. This is not just done innocently. It is a shrewd marketing tactic. The only way someone like JP becomes as popular as he is, is by being deliberately controversial and polarizing.
</p>

<p>
	Many of JP's viewers don't even realize his teachings are a Trojan horse for a stage Blue value system. They lack any capacity to make such fine distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	Fear-mongering and moral crusading is a classic stage Blue recruitment tool.
</p>

<p>
	Not to mention how JP's philosophy makes young men hate women.
</p>

<p>
	JP is not popular because he helps evolve Blue people but because his philosophy is the perfect excuse for Blue people to never evolve. The Blue ego seeks sources to tell it that Blue is best and there is no higher to go. Blue has this need and Blue will pull out their wallet to pay for it being met.
</p>

<p>
	Trashing JP is not the point. The point is to be aware of the Trojan horse.

<p>
	You guys should really contemplate this one deeply. There's a lot here.
</p>

<p>
	It takes an enormous leap in consciousness for a caveman to understand that a finger pointing at a deer actually means "look at over there". Or that a finger can even be used to point.
</p>

<p>
	The entire notion of "pointing" is non-obvious and had to be invented.
</p>

<p>
	A rabbit does not know what pointing is. You can point your finger at the rabbit all day long but he will not understand that you are pointing to the wolf sneaking up behind him. Because you invented pointing while the rabbit didn't.
</p>

<p>
	How is it possible (at all) that you can take a thing (finger) to mean something it is obviously not ("look over there").
</p>

			Leo, you are absolutely right those are very serious issues. And I care about those things. To me, JP is pointing to those top capitalist who are using their influence to use propaganda in the media and lobby the government in an effort to create a totalitarian system. I think JP and libertarianism sprang up for this reason. Even JP in his book talks about not being an ideologue about anything. I went through a phase of libertarianism, watched some Milton Friedman material, I felt it was necessary to really understand the effect of individualism, but I also saw its limitations. Which I believe there is an alternative to the capitalism we have now and the communism that happened then.

<p>
	Libertarianism is a stage Orange trap. It will not solve those social issues. It will actually worsen them.
</p>

<p>
	You are NOT going to curb pollution by deregulation. You will only get more pollution.
</p>

<p>
	In a free marketplace, ego will exploit, dominate, monopolize, and enslave everyone it can, until it stopped by use of force.
</p>

<p>
	Libertarianism is fundamentally untenable because it does not understand how ego works, how exploitative ego is.
</p>

<p>
	If allowed, ego will enslave and rape. The history books are filled with that.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot tame the ego to good behavior through reason and moral principles, as libertarians imagine. State use of force is absolutely required.
</p>

<p>
	Anarchism is even more naive and foolish than libertarianism.

	Contemplate:

<ul>
	<li>
		What is a distinction?
	</li>
	<li>
		What is language?
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Contemplate them separately.
</p>

<p>
	Find each one in your direct experience and observe. Do not think or speculate about them.

One trip will be worth 100 hours of my videos. Of course, it's precisely because this vehicle is so effective that most people do not want to use it. Because it was never their desire to wake up. The biggest bottleneck in this work is desire. People just don't desire to understand reality deeply. And so they never do.
</p>

<p>
	You tend to get from life exactly what you desire. Weak desire, wrong desire results in a weak life, wrong life.

			What JP fears is another communism again, as in one man with an ideology being used to make the masses submit. That is a valid concern since it has happened in history and one wants to avoid it.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not a valid concern because: A) no mainstream person anywhere is advocating communism or Marxism, B) stage Green is not communism. There is not a single communist elected official in America.
</p>

<p>
	You have to start to become aware of capitalist propaganda. It goes almost unnoticed in the US.
</p>

<p>
	Read some Noam Chomsky if you want to understand how this propaganda game works.
</p>

<p>
	Valid political concerns would be: gross income inequality, corporate corruption of government through lobbying and dark money, the military-industrial complex pushing for endless wars and arms deals, 50,000+ people dying every year from corporate pushing of prescription opioid drugs, and environmental pollution which gives people cancer and disease.
</p>

<p>
	These are real measurable issues that kill tens of thousands of people very year. These issues need solutions which stage Blue & Orange cannot provide. Only Green+ can attempt to solve those problems.
</p>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	Distinction is not language.
</p>

<p>
	The world is not language either. You can stop language but the world will not disappear.

</p>

<p>
	Which is why the alt-right is so obsessed with cucking. It's a projection of their own fears.
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing original about this value system. It's been the dominant value system for over 1000 years. But now it is dying in Western democratic countries all over the world. But Blue will not let it go. Hence people JP construct a clingy ideology to counteract the inevitable.

</p>

<p>
	What's being pointed out here is the self-biased nature of the ego-mind.
