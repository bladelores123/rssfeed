<p>
	Those emotional reactions and judgments are the clue which tells you that your mind is resisting some truth.
</p>

<p>
	If you properly integrate Blue you will no longer be emotionally triggered by it and you will stop judging it.
</p>

<p>
	You clearly have some Blue shadow that requires integration for you to reach the next level of your evolution.

<p>
	It's not a marketing strategy. The course was designed to deal with that precise issue.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Pakman and Seder are the most mature and wise. Many of the others are reactionaries with an axe to grind. Seder probably has the most wisdom and technical knowledge of how government works, which is highly important. He actually bothers to interview academics and researchers who are not simply political players.
</p>

<p>
	But even Seder lacks the deeper perceptive of Tier 2 which is necessary to understand why people are trapped in various political factions.
</p>

<p>
	Relativity is lost on all these people. There's no understanding that they are acting out agendas of the ego-mind.

	You imagine other people, so of course you are still here imagining them gone.

<p>
	Keep your hair well-groomed. Look SHARP.
</p>

<p>
	This is also very much a cultural thing. It depends where you're trying to attract girls. Girls in the US have certain cultural expectations. If you go in the club smelling like curry, well, good luck.

<p>
	Krystal and Saagar are starting to lose their minds to populism.
</p>

<p>
	They have become a broken record and they ware brainwashing their listeners with that ideology.
</p>

<p>
	So watch out who you follow on YT. People are brainwashing you with good intentions because they do not know how to look at reality in a deeper way. All these stage Green channels are not as wise as they think they are, and they are definitely brainwashing you along with themselves.

<title>Resistance against tripping again</title>

<p>
	If you are not ready to trip, do not trip. That's my rule. It has to feel "right". It's a bit like launching a rocket. You make a plan to launch tomorrow, but that doesn't mean you will launch if something looks off on launch day. You abort and wait for another good day. And if you have to abort several days in a row, that tells you that you maybe shouldn't trip this month -- that you have more integration work to do.

<p>
	The reason this question keeps coming up and the reason you will never resolve it logically is because the answer requires a profound awakening on the question of "What is 'other'?"
</p>

<p>
	You will never understand this until you have that specific kind of awakening.
</p>

<p>
	You do not know what "other" is. The ego-mind CANNOT know what "other" is because it doesn't know what Self is. The more you try to logically understand other, the more deluded you become.
</p>

<p>
	To be honest, Martin lacks a lot of mastery and embodiment work. Psychedelics can only get you so far. He still has a lot of attachments.
</p>

<p>
	There is a big gulf between woke people and deeply masterful woke people who have a deep embodiment & purification.

You can't tell me you wouldn't enjoy seeing the masses busting out of their absolutes. The only thing better than that is being able to say you played a part in it. And the only thing that needs defending is a fragile ego, be it an individual or collectives.

<p>
	Knocking the status quo simply out of a populist desire to do so, without proper nuance or understanding of why the status quo exists, is a dangerous thing. There is criticizing of the status quo from above and from below. Most of these conspiracy theories are going in the wrong direction and they will not produce an evolution to the next stage but rather a devolution.
</p>

<p>
	The status quo is better than ignorant populist conspiracy theories. Be very careful with the populist sentiments which are growing popular on YT and other social media platforms. It is turning into mindless mob mentality which breeds falsehood and devilry. It's not just enough to be suspicious of those in power, you must build on their achievements and offer something even more intelligent -- not just bash them.
</p>

<p>
	What's starting to happen now is the masses are acting out of fear, suspicion, and insecurity, which will lead to evil. This is antithetical to consciousness. It's all too easy to rail against those in power from behind your computer when actually you have no capacity to lead people and achieve positive results in the real world.

	If your edgy political documentary uses copyrighted video clips, yeah, it will get "censored". Welcome to DMCA copyright law.

			where does the misnomer that awakening/enlightenment means automatically becoming an emotionally mastered terminator that experiences no uncomfortable experiences and is in pure heaven 24/7 with no chance of ever wavering from this state? I've awakened but still feel I have much to do when it comes to managing and integration my emotions and beliefs. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Normies love to mythologize and idealize awakened gurus, treating them as saints.
</p>

<p>
	It's actually a clever defense mechanism of the ego-mind. The ego-mind reasons like this: "If awakening doesn't make a person perfect and good, then it's not real and not worth working towards." By putting the guru on a pedestal the normie/student doesn't have to take responsibility for the hard work that must go into perfecting one's life. The normie/student wants awakening to be an instant cure-all to all of life's problems. This is of course a fantasy.

			Well after a big circle jerk since leaving uni (tested out many passions I had as hobby’s and trying them as a career) I have come to realise that the thing I like the most is the subject I studied at uni (maths). It find it way better studying it outside of the uni setting then in uni. Way more passionate about it now.
		</p>

		<p>
			I also love programming. I have been studying AI since lockdown and realise that it is a subject that requires skills in programming and maths amazing combination for my interests
		</p>

		<p>
			I don’t know what exactly I want out of the field. I have business ideas that I have written down but they seem way out of my skill set so far for me to produce.
		</p>

		<p>
			I want to help society problems by using AI. Maybe helping businesses with utilising it.
		</p>

		<p>
			It just seems Deep Learning is at the forefront of AI atm but not utilised as much as simpler machine learning algorithms.

<p>
	Well, then, I suggest you keep pursuing that passion and see where it leads you. Do some small projects and see how you feel about the work. And contemplate more deeply what you want in the big picture with AI.
</p>

<p>
	Research what possibilities exist within AI that excite you.
</p>

<p>
	At this early stage you will be a generalist, and that's okay because you have no reason/purpose for specializing yet.

<p>
	Your mistake is conflating truth realization with changes or improvements in one's behavior. These are independent things.
</p>

<p>
	Even awakened people can have addictions, "bad" behavior, and other stuff. That's called being human. Realizing what is true will not automatically make you a saint. Survival is still a powerful force that remains post-awakening.

<p>
	Sweet! Lots of good insights there.
</p>

<p>
	How do you integrate? You are already in the middle of it. Spend more time contemplating what this means for your life.
</p>

<p>
	Integration does not mean you will be in the LSD state all the time. Integration is a subtle process. Be happy with a little of wisdom retained from each trip. It's like a 1% to 5% boost to your growth. Over years those 1% boosts add up to something big. But no one trip is too significant.

<p>
	It's about actualizing your potential. A human being isn't born complete. A human being must work on herself to become great and God-like. This has nothing to do with not accepting yourself. Greatness requires effort. Even accepting yourself requires effort.
</p>

<p>
	You only have two options in life: to be mediocre and shitty, or great. If you don't make the effort to be great, you will be shitty by default. Devilry is the default position for humans. Unbecoming a devil takes a lifetime of work.
</p>

<p>
	How about helping raise an adopted child to be a healthy and loved adult? That's not paramount? You want that child to become a mass shooter?
</p>

<p>
	Notice how utterly selfish your position is. The reason you feel it's important to have kids is because it's all wrapped up with your ego. Self-bias 101, survival 101. You are just acting out a survival script like an animal.

<p>
	Then again, it's just a divorce. Happens to people all the time. There's no need to make a giant narrative out of it. People grow apart from each other frequently. It's okay. You move on and meet new people and keep growing.
</p>

<p>
	50 years old is still very young.
</p>

<p>
	Ralston just got newly married and he's almost 70! Martin will find a new girl.

<title>Nonduality ruined my Life Purpose.</title>

<p>
	First of all, yeah, nonduality tends to upend one's plans and one's life. That's the point.
</p>

<p>
	But also....

			i see that fundamentally al psychological problems mostly stem from ego and believing in your "own" thoughts. I feel like i would be cheating on people if i would show them a lot of empathy for their "problems", taking them serious, as they would only make them worse in the end, and not be a permanent solution. Also receiving money and making a living out of this this would feel kinda weird. I think for this to work right now, i would have to put on a huge mask and fake it. It just feels wrong.

</blockquote>

<p>
	You fundamentally misunderstand how nonduality connects with psychology.
</p>

<p>
	Psychological problems are not fake. They are real and people suffer enormously from them. 99% of people are not ready for awakening or nonduality. Most people need years of remedial psychological work in order to bring them up to a functional level where nonduality might become a possibility for them. People need to be gradually guided up to nonduality. You can serve this important function.
</p>

<p>
	Also, psychological problems and nonduality are not mutually exclusive. I know enlightened people who might still go and see a therapist. Enlightenment does not eliminate all of one's psychological problems. Much growth and work remains post-enlightenment. You are cheating yourself if you aren't empathetic towards people's psychological difficulties. Because that's Love.
</p>

<p>
	Also, empathy for people's "problems" is an important part of enlightenment as it opens you up to Love. There is nothing fake about helping people at whatever level they are at.
</p>

<p>
	There is a huge opportunity to combine nonduality & psychotherapy. Most therapists lack a deep existential foundation, which awakening would give you. You could become an extremely effective therapist, guiding people from the psychological into the mystical. Or you could focus your practice to cater to clients who are pursuing spirituality/nonduality. Making you an exceptional guru with a deep understanding of psychological issues that hold people back from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	For most people the biggest obstacle to awakening is sorting through all of their psychological baggage, fear, insecurity, anger, and trauma.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	And more broadly speaking, the field of psychotherapy needs to be extended and integrated with nonduality for truly effective treatment. You can be a leader in this emerging trend.
</p>

<p>
	Stop pitting life purpose against awakening. If anything, awakening should deepen your commitment to a life purpose. Just upgrade your LP. Make it big enough to align with awakening.

	There's literally no need to pass anything down because you already are the entire Universe.

	Your fantasy of "passing stuff down" is just that -- pure fantasy. You might as well have broken up with her because she couldn't shit out a unicorn.

<p>
	If reality is ONE, then it must be unlimited because there is nothing outside itself to limit it. And if it is unlimited then it can literally do whatever the fuck it wants instantaneously. That's how God gets its power. God's power comes simply from the fact that God is ONE and has no other. To be ONE is to be totally sovereign. God cannot be limited by anything other than itself because it invents/imagines all limits. The ability to imagine all limits is what makes God unlimited in power because it is not bound by any of them.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize the above, your life will never be the same again.
</p>

<p>
	That is the heart of God-realization.

<p>
	From the absolute perspective Beauty is Infinite and Total.
</p>

<p>
	But from the human perspective you will certainly have biases which cause you to find some things to be more beautiful. That's normal and okay as long as you don't turn it into some neurotic chase for perfection.
</p>

<p>
	You are certainly allowed to find some people more attractive than others. You're not meant to sleep with any random person. Find the people that turn you on. You can still appreciate people even though you may not want to sleep with them.
</p>

<p>
	Personally, I have very high standards in terms of who I would sleep with. But I have also opened myself up to Absolute Beauty and can see the beauty even of "ugly" people.
</p>

<p>
	What you find beautiful/attractive is not an objective standard, it's purely self-biased. But, hey, that's okay. The mind will always have biases and preferences. You're not going to have sex with a hunchback.

	Read some of Maxwell Maltz books like Psychocybernetics. He was an early plastic surgeon who describes the psychological effects of plastic surgery on people. For some people it is a neurotic escape and it doesn't solve their underlying self-esteem issues. For other people, they get one minor fix and it significantly improves their self-esteem. In which case it's worth it.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can learn to accept and love yourself either way, but there's also nothing wrong with getting a minor tweak if it's a relatively simple thing and it will make you like yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Just don't fall into the trap of constantly trying to perfect yourself through surgery. This is where some Hollywood types go wrong and give plastic surgery a bad name.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: if you had some crooked teeth, it's legitimate to go the dentist to get them straightened out. You want to have a nice smile that you are confident in.
</p>

<p>
	Ana Kasparian from TYT got a nose job and it looks great. I think she's an example of doing it right. Not over-done, not obsessive.

At this point, I've seen 8+ reports of people really fucking themselves up through the use of psychedelics and I'm not talking merely about some very bad trip but a real mental illness that either causes somebody to commit suicide or takes years to recover from and in some cases they never recover. Even something as light as weed can cause years of serious problems if you're unlucky.

<p>
	Such things can happen to anyone doing serious spiritual work. When we are talking about realizing the deepest nature of reality.... yeah, it's a lot to handle. Spirituality has some inherent risks and dangers.

	But that's not the main reason I think he wants to fight.
</p>

<p>
	I think he wants to fight again to recapture some of his former glory and have a sense of purpose.
</p>

<p>
	One of the worst things is to be a world champion where everyone loves you for your talent, and then not being able to do that any more. It's a huge downer to lose one's purpose and become a useless old has-been.
</p>

<p>
	If I couldn't shoot any more videos tomorrow, it would be really sad because I invested so much effort to build up that talent and it gives me a sense of significance. But for Mike it's much worse than it would be for me, because I always have awakening I can find refuge in while he does not.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Playing devil's advocate, actually God is closer to a feeling than it is a logical puzzle.
</p>

<p>
	If you just shut up and try to feel God & Love, you'll do much better than intellectually masturbating about it.
</p>

<p>
	I think you guys are neglecting the power of things like faith, devotion, commitment, and feeling.
</p>

<p>
	Religion can be a powerful healing & transformative force -- despite all it's obvious problems. Religious people are not just in delusion or fantasy. They are reaching out to God in their own crude way and it does transform them for the better in many cases. Of course devilry and ego still runs rampant. But it does so even among meditators and yogis.
</p>

<p>
	It's extremely rare to find a totally pure and selfless person.
</p>

<p>
	And there is more to all this than just awakening. Awakening will not make you a totally pure person by itself. Becoming God-like is a much larger project than simply meditation or self-inquiry.

<p>
	That is irrelvant. That's an evaluation you are making.

<p>
	Total Awakeness can last 1 second or 1 century, it makes no difference from Truth's POV.
</p>

<p>
	What's true is true regardless of how long you are aware of it or what state you are in. Truth and Love are identical whether you are aware of it or not.

	It's matured me a lot. Ripened me with wisdom and grounded me.

<p>
	Of course I have much work left to do on myself.

<p>
	Don't assume that all gurus are talking about a singular thing called enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	"Enlightenment" is more like a giant spectrum of possible awakened states and ways of being.
</p>

<p>
	You can have an awakening with God-realization or without, and there are many degrees of God-realization.
</p>

<p>
	There are literally 100s if not 1000s of different awakened states possible.
</p>

<p>
	This is a very arrogant framing.
</p>

<p>
	People who go to chruch are often very serious about it and put in a lot of effort in walking a spiritual path. They are basically doing a crude, traditional form of Actualized.org
</p>

<p>
	Prayer is a legit spiritual technique.
</p>

<p>
	Of course they can feel God. That doesn't mean they are awake or that all of them feel God. Some of them do. Most of them don't. And just because you feel God does not preclude delusion. Even awakening does not preclude delusion. Self-deception and the self-bias and corruptions of the ego-mind are a near-constant driving force.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate the power of belief and faith. Billions of people are religious for good reason: it actually improves their lives.
</p>

<p>
	Your view of religion is too negative and it's clear you've never hung out with serious religious people or partook in their practices.
</p>

<p>
	To be God-realized requires firmness, principle, and integrity. You can't let some ignorant devil gaslight you into falsehood. You must be strong enough to stand your ground and do what you know is in alignment with Truth, Love, and wisdom. Appeasing devils is not Love or wisdom.

			how can i truly grow from this experience? i am still hung up on the failure? its 5 years of my life where i just did medical school stuff, 5 months of intense stress that ultimately brought this emotional baggage of not getting what i want. how to deal with this ?? the wound is deeper than i thought. how do i know where my heart is ? <strong>how do i follow my heart in this situation?</strong>
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I can relate. My first job didn't work out the way I wanted either. It was heartbreaking, but also it presented me with my biggest opportunity for advancing my career. Within a year I quit that job and started my own business.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you sunk a lot of time in this, but now you're getting clear about what you definitely don't want in terms of your career. This clarity is worth the price you paid for it if you use it to realign yourself towards what your heart and soul are truly calling you to do.
</p>

<p>
	What is your life purpose? Are you clear? What is your heart set on doing career-wise? If it's psychiatry (let's just assume that for now), then all you need to do to feel better about yourself is to double-down on your vision to become an amazing psychiatrist. How it will happen is largely irrelevant. You must program yourself with the vision that this what you want and you will make it happen. There is no good reason why you cannot become a psychiatrist eventually. It might takes some years, but people become psychiatrists all the time, so can you. It's just a question of clarity, vision, and passion. How badly do you want it? Even if you can't be a psychiatrist right now, it doesn't matter because what matters is your vision. You can spend the next few years just building up the vision and training yourself such that you become so good as a candidate that people won't be able to ignore you.
</p>

<p>
	Stop waiting for someone to make you a psychiatrist. If it is your vision, you already ARE a psychiatrist -- it's just not been made official yet. From today on start acting as if you were a real psychiatrist. Go above and beyond what a normal psychiatrist does. Do whatever you must to make yourself exceptional in this field. Do the research, read the books, attend seminars and workshops, read journals, make psychiatrist friends, do free psychiatry on your friends and family for practice, act like psychiatrist in your dreams and visualizations, go to a hypnotist and ask him to program you that you are a successful psychiatrist, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This is not an external world career problem. This is a vision and self-confidence problem. It's a lack of passion and commitment problem. You are unclear and doubting yourself.

<p>
	That's the kicker! True Love means you don't see a difference betweem more or less love. LOVE is absolute.
</p>

<p>
	True Love embraces evil so deeply that evil is litterally converted into Love, leaving behind less than nothing. That is the very essence of love: the total embrace of EVERYTHING! Love is a Perfection without an opposite. It is ONE. Evil, badness, or negativity requires two, which is falsehood because Infinity is ONE. 
</p>

<p>
	Truth = ONE = Love = God = YOU = Infinity = Nothing = Death
</p>

<p>
	That's all there is to reality.
</p>

<p>
	That is Total Awakening.
</p>

<p>
	When you get this, you've completed life.

	When I went skydiving I had to sign a waiver that if my parachute fails none of my relatives are allowed to sue the skydiving company or instructors.
</p>

<p>
	That was a sobering document to sign, Lol.
</p>

<p>
	When I pulled that cord, I prayed to God that it would open. And I didn't believe in God back then, Lol.

	Rationality is highly limited and it's always co-opted by the ego-mind for purposes of its survival.
</p>

<p>
	Rationality is the chief mechanism of self-deception. Every deluded person thinks he is rational.

	Not a single facet is negative because God consciousness don't project the idea of "negative".
</p>

<p>
	Murder is a real part of God. But God doesn't judge it as wrong or negative the way a human mind does.
</p>

<p>
	You have to truly grasp that murder is not negative.

<p>
	The easy solution here is to take a psychedelic and let it show you.
</p>

<p>
	You need a new awakening on the nature of what "other" is. Your awakening is very far from complete. You have not yet realized that the self/other distinction is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Your bother is you.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/17143-khron/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="17143" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/17143-khron/" rel="">@Khron</a> Your problem isn't sex, it's the inability to relate to people in an intimate and loving way where you don't use them as objects to satisfy your survival.
</p>

<p>
	You see, no one has taught you how to consciously relate to people. You think of people like pawns to satisfy your needs. Fundamentally you fear true loving relationship. The ego-mind cannot truly love or relate because it is too needy and fearful of losing itself in the process.
</p>

<p>
	Focus on working on Self-Love.
</p>

<p>
	A psychedelic can be very helpful here to gain clarity and heal yourself. Then you will be able to relate better to others.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking of intimacy as some box you must check off Maslow's list in order to be happy. Rather see it as an expression of your ability to Love, which is the whole point of life: to learn how to Love more deeply and selflessly.
</p>

<p>
	Love is not about getting love from others. Love is about raising your consciousness to the point where you are radiating love out to the world and the world reflects it back at you.
</p>

<p>
	You can start to heal by loving the fact that you enjoy sex, porn, masturbation, and intimacy. There is nothing wrong with these things. Stop shaming and guilting yourself for being a highly sexual creature. Sex is an amazing aspect of God! It is a beautiful thing! You'd have to be a zombie not to like it.
</p>

<p>
	The whole no-fap shaming movement is toxic and counter-productive. You can't shame and guilt yourself into abstainence. Give yourself the love you need, but do it consciously.
</p>

<p>
	There are healthy ways to masturbate and you can still pursue sex and relationships. These are not mutually exclusive things. Don't blame your virginity on masturbation. The problem there is lack of responsibility and inaction in socializing/dating.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't need to be just about sex. It can be whatever you want it to be, but don't get too attached to it. This is basically true of any relationship. Feel whatever emotions feel natural.
</p>

<p>
	The real issue here is the attachment and clinging.

<p>
	Everything is positive from God's POV.
</p>

<p>
	"Negative side" is something the ego mind projects on the world for the purposes of survival.

<p>
	Of course you do. Because you are selfish. And thus evil.
</p>

<p>
	See, you reject yourself and you reject God (which is everything). One who rejects God is otherwise known as a devil.
</p>

<p>
	Survival requires that you reject that anything goes. Which is why survival must be surrendered if you wish to be Good.

</p>

<p>
	Your question is one of survival, which is falsehood, which is evil. Hence by trying to survive, you create the evil which you claim you want to avoid.
</p>

<p>
	To truly be Good you must surrender survival. Which is why hardly any human is Good. The one thing you need to do to be truly moral, you refuse to do.
</p>

<p>
	See, "morality" is something the evil ego uses to create a smokescreen to distract from its own fundamental selfishness. If you're worried about people being immoral, that's only because their immorality interferes with your ability to be immoral.
</p>

<p>
	Immorality is just selfishness. So a self cannot be moral. Only no-self can be moral.

	Good experimenting. Thanks for reporting your results.
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, it affects people differently. I definitely get a highly visionary vibe from DMT. But it's not just visuals, it's allows me to deeply contemplate reality and puts me into an instant nondual, God-mode state. It's like a more visionary and milder version of 5-MeO-DMT for me.

<p>
	The only true morality is one which recognizes that all acts of evil are actually Good. Hence anything goes.

<p>
	Hell/suffering is falsehood. So you are asking whether falsehood could ever overpower Truth, which is absurd, since falsehood is an illusion. Truth always wins out in the end because it is true and falsehood is false.
</p>

<p>
	Basically you are asking if falsehood can ever be True. To which the answer is an obvious no.

			Lol what? But how then one can diferenciate between delusion (looking for sincronicities in everything) and true "communication" between you and God?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course there's really no difference.
</p>

<p>
	Imagination IS reality. There are just degrees and levels of imagination, some of which you imagine are more real than others.
</p>

<p>
	You ARE God! Once you realize that, EVERYTHING becomes a synchronicity and a communication. Because you are not yet fully God realized your mind is still playing partial games, taking certain things to be more meaningful and God-like than other things. But one day you will awaken to the fact that the shit stains in your toilet are as much a communication from God as your favorite song on TV.
</p>

<p>
	The deepest God-realization is beyond messages, signs, synchronicities, and communications. You simply sit there as God itself. No communication is necessary or even possible when you are ONE.
</p>

	It ain't gonna work. Enjoy the fling but don't kid yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible to be intimate and also cut it off on a dime.
</p>

<p>
	Stop treating intimacy as though it's some special snowflake. You can build intimacy with anyone at any time. Take ownership of that. There is nothing "special" about any one person. Every person is "special" if you decide they are. Romance typically involves a lot of illusion, so be mindful of how your own mind tricks you.

<p>
	Nothing personal, but whatever degree of awakening he has, it's tiny compared to what is possible.
</p>

<p>
	He will not lead you to deep awakening. He's busy playing rationalist games.

<p>
	I don't have a beef with him. I say this only to inform people that if you want deep awakening, you won't find it in his work.

<p>
	Yes, of course.
</p>

<p>
	It's 100% convincing because everything is your imagination and you are the sole authority.
</p>

<p>
	You ARE the universe, so the cogs not only align they become identical while you are awake.

<p>
	The point of all this is to awaken, not to endlessly masturbate about awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Jed McKenna has some good quotes on this point.
</p>

<p>
	Once you awaken you will not give a shit about the Bible or Jesus or Buddha or all that.

<p>
	What's nice about these videos is that they show you what you're signing up for when you sign up with Octavio. So if you want a bootcamp type of experience where he pushes you for a full breakthrough -- and that can be valuable if you're a whimp -- then he's the guy for you.
</p>

<p>
	From my experience trip-sitting folks who take 5-MeO-DMT, many of them whimp out and back out after the first or second dose and they never get a breakthrough. Of course I never push them further. But I can see the value in pushing someone who's just being a whimp. The ego-mind is very clever in avoiding a 5-MeO-DMT breakthrough. It's like it subconsciously knows to stay away from a full dose.
</p>

<p>
	I would just never want the responsibility of pushing someone in way over their head. So I don't push people.
</p>

<p>
	But at the same time, when I see someone whimp out, it is heartbreaking that they are basically saying No! to the most important experience of their life. Sad.
</p>

<p>
	You're damned if you do and damned if you don't.
</p>

	Something like that.

<p>
	Everything must collapse. All of the mind's explanations and models must collapse. The mind must surrender and acknowledge its own futility in the face of God. The mind must become unmoored. The bottom of reality must fall out.

	They probably practice a lot in various ways.

<p>
	And also, people on TV are often gonna be naturals too. A person doesn't get on TV unless you're exceptionally talented.

	India has a deep philosophical/spiritual tradition. Osho was basically a philosopher. So was Sri Aurobindo. And countless others. Why don't you take some inspiration from them?
</p>

<p>
	You can teach yourself philosophy. In fact, that's really the only way you can be a serious philosopher.

<p>
	Imagine for a moment that the entire universe is one single Infinite Mind. But this mind suffers from split personality disorder. This mind fractured itself into a trillion sub-minds which each imagine they are independent. But if ever this Infinite Mind awakens to itself, it will realize that all the "other" minds were always just fractures of itself. And then the Mind becomes ONE. The split personality disorder is healed.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how you treat your body as a single whole unit. You don't think of your arm, your leg, your dick, and your head as all being different "others". You clearly see that they are all ONE unified whole. But someone who is fractured and thinks that the arm, leg, dick, and head are all separate things would say, "But that's solipsism to think that you are one unified body!" It's solipsism from his fractured perspective. But actually it's just holism from the higher, unified perspective.
</p>

<p>
	Now extend that logic to the entire universe.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Penrose doesn't grasp that reality must fundamentally be groundless. He is trying to ground consciousness is some other thing, like microtubules, brains, matter, quantum wave functions, math, or whatever else. But consciousness cannot ever be grounded in any such thing because consciousness is that which imagines those things.
</p>

<p>
	That is the fundamental insight he's missing.
</p>

<p>
	The reason consciousness is non-computable is because it is infinite and it imagines computation. Computation is a sub-set of consciousness, so of course consciousness itself cannot be computable. That notion is simply absurd. So he's got the right intuition but he's missing an awakening to Infinity.

<p>
	No, I think there are less enlightened women because culture does not encourage women to pursue such things.
</p>

<p>
	People largely become enlightened because culture guides them in that direction somehow. They rarely do it on their own.

<p>
	He speaks of consciousness as if it is a thing which can be turned on and off or created. This is just silly. It's a funadmental misunderstanding of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	I don't need to wait for 500 years for science to figure out what consciousness is. I have already figured it out, and so can you.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness can become fully conscious of itself. In fact, that's the only way. Science will never reach such a level of understanding because science is finite and consciousness is infinite.

<p>
	If you are conscious you will recognize when a person is not a suitable match for you and end the relationship peacefully before it turns toxic.
</p>

<p>
	You will still have thoughts post-awakening.
</p>

<p>
	If you are conscious you will never get trapped in toxic relationships. Fear is what keeps you in toxic relationships. The more conscious you are, the less fear you will have.

	Of course they don't. Not at the level of knowing why each decision gets made.

	They just create a neural net and let it wire itself. It's sort of like growing a brain in a lab. You can grow one, but you won't know how it them learns and knows what it knows. You won't be able to map all of the billions of connections it makes.

<p>
	No drug works the same for everybody. This is a basic medicinal fact.
</p>

<p>
	People can be very different.

<p>
	Start low: 125ug
</p>

<p>
	It's easy to overwhelm yourself with LSD. It's a looooong trip.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not an emotional state. It's a state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	"State" is a much misused word by spiritual people. So be careful. What I mean by "state" is not necessarily what they mean by "state".
</p>

<p>
	Technically, everything is a state. A state is not just an emotional high, which is how many spiritual teachers mis-define it.
</p>

			What if science manages to build robots with self awareness and Consciousness identical to our human awareness?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I expect that one day science WILL be able to build something close to that.
</p>

<p>
	But this will be a very different science than the materialist science of today.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing in nonduality/spirituality which says that you cannot build a conscious robot. It should be possible, since "nature" builds conscious robots -- i.e., humans -- every day. But we are VERY far away from that.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind that there is a big difference between building a thing and understanding how it works. Today, humans are building complex AIs which are able to do amazing things like play chess or Go or driving a car. But humans have no idea how these AI actually perform their amazing feats. The neural network is so vastly complex that no human mind could ever untangle it. But we can build it.
</p>

<p>
	A human mind is never going to be able to logically untangle something as complex as a human brain/mind. But I think it should be possible to build artificial minds. But probably not within the materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Oneness
</p>

<p>
	All difference is imaginary. The difference between self/other is imaginary. It exists as long as you imagine that it does. And if you become conscious enough, you will understand that you are holding that difference in your imagination, and you will drop it, and you will realize that -- obviously -- there is no difference between anything, and you will merge into Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking about this and actually do some spiritual practices.
</p>

<p>
	Your problem is that you are stuck thinking and arguing about this stuff without doing any practices. So you will never get it until you realize that you're wasting time and procrastinating on doing the practices.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is such a radical thing that it cannot ever be explained to you. You must take responsibility for awakening yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You are not already enlightened. This is the dumbest thing spiritual people say.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is a specific state of consciousness. If you are not in this state, you are simply not awake and you are light years from awakening.
</p>

<p>
	That being said, awakening is nowhere else but HERE and NOW.

<p>
	There is just Nothing. Nothing experiences itself being Nothing. Or, in other words, Nothing simply <u>is</u>.
</p>

<p>
	You are already it, you're just not understanding it. You think Nothing is something other than what you see right now.
</p>

<p>
	This right now is Nothing!
</p>

<p>
	Your salvia trip was Nothing.

<p>
	You were told that you are inside an Infinite Mind and everything is imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Now you got a taste of that and the ego didn't like it.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get lost in the content of a trip. The content is infinite as it is all God's imagination. If you imagine you are a couch dreaming of being human: that's precisely what reality will become!
</p>

<p>
	It's ALL relative. However you hold reality is what it becomes. There is no reality aside from how you hold it.
</p>

<p>
	Salvia is a twisted beast. That doesn't invalidate anything I teach. It simply mindfucks you so deep that you have a hard time making sense of it.
</p>

<p>
	I told you not to do salvia. But a fool only learns by hitting his head against the wall.
</p>

			Is learning to brew your own ayahuasca an option? I feel like ayahuasca has much more potential than DMT or even 5-MeO-DMT due to duration. To me even LSD and shrooms are more useful than 5-MeO due to duration, but that's just me.

<p>
	I don't like brewing some nasty vomit-inducing sludge.
</p>

<p>
	You can eat pure N,N-DMT + harmala, but that requires observing the MAOI diet.
</p>

<p>
	DPT gives a solid 3 hour trip and it's super visionary. I imagine it's similar to Aya. And you can plug DPT and it has no tolerance.

	There is no shortcut for this.

	Just do it -- is the solution. Just do it A LOT until you get good.

			But why a person with a level above me would genuinely be interested in me!? Sorry if the question is stupid but I have been thinking about it for a while. How can I contribute or bring something to the table in this scenario? Perhaps, it always works in a male case, since guys ultimately leaders, but what if a woman a level above?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	One level above is close enough that one can help pull the other up.
</p>

<p>
	If you love someone, you'll help pull them up. Attraction doesn't happen based on stages or values. So you can always get attracted to someone at a lower level than you. In fact, that's the most likely scenario.

			If time is an illusion and I am the entire happening, then the one who becomes enlightened will always be the same?

			When the universe (I) decides it wants to go another round of duality, everything will unfold exactly the same way because infinity has only one path. That sounds like a counter intuitive thoughts "Infinity only has one path". I hope you can understand what I am trying to say.

<p>
	One/many is a duality. They are actually the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity means you can keep creating more stuff without ever repeating a single thing. Think of how the natural numbers work. They are endless. They never need to repeat themselves because they are infinite.

		<p>
			How does the universe have a will? From the perspective I have it seems that we might project intention as a concept onto the universe, would it not be just a cycle, with no free will? It's just this thing that is happening for eternity. It makes me nervous and sad. I wish there was free will. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, free will vs not free will is a duality. God's Will is 100% given to being being Selfless and Love. There is no difference between God choosing to be Love, and God forced to be Love. They are identical. When you are infinitely conscious you will necessarily give all your Will to endless Selfelssness and Love. You will choose it because any other choice would be insane.
