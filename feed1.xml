Should be easier for you to do some mushrooms or LSD at home with a friend trip-sitting. Start with small doses.

	An interesting thing I've noticed: The highest quality teachers usually do not teach psychic powers. They generally don't even talk about them even though they have them.

<p>
	That's probably because your mental image of Green is too caricatured, too stereotypical. By which I mean you're thinking of Green as some pot-smoking hippie wearing Native American feather earrings and a peace symbol necklace. That kind of person probably is Green, but that's not the only version of Green that exists.
</p>

<p>
	Green is a set of values, not some stereotypical hippie image.
</p>

<p>
	My political value set is very Green. I very much care about equality, egalitarianism, and the excesses of capitalism.
</p>

<p>
	I'm also very big into relativity. My notions of relativity are more extreme than most post-modernist academics.
</p>

<p>
	I just don't wear my Green on my sleeves, and being a lone-wolf type of guy, I don't participate in any kind of mob mentality or group activities which many Green people indulge in. Even during group meditation retreats I never meditate with the group. I meditate alone.
</p>

<p>
	I've had a Green value set ever since I was like 10 years old. I never really cared about money, I cared more about peace and art.

			2. There is no such thing as "post-rationalist", sure it's sexy statement, but it does not exist, everything is logical , and I am talking about Logic in very broad sense , I am not referring to Formal Logic or Mathematics, so I am talking about reason, you can't argue against reason because you need reason to argue in the first place, if you say logic is bad because , for example : GÃ¶del'sÂ incompleteness theorems , you are using reason to think about Godel's theorem as an example of anti-logic or something. Realizing limits of logic is logical and reasonableÂ so reason is the foundation of everything.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There definitely is such a thing as post-rational. You just haven't gotten there yet.
</p>

<p>
	What you are saying is still within the Aristotelian linear logical paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The point of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem is that it cannot be understood via logic. It is only understandable via intuition. You think you are using logic when really you are using intuition. You cannot encapsulate Truth mechanically. Or in other words: all logic relies on intuition.
</p>

<p>
	But even that aside, there is something even deeper than Godel's theorems. Yes, Godel's work is still largely within the rationalist paradigm, however, that's just the departure point.
</p>

<p>
	The point of post-rationalism is that you stop using reason entirely, you stop arguing, you stop proving, you stop communicating, you stop thinking.
</p>

<p>
	Reason is not the foundation of anything. Reason is just word-games. The foundations of reality have nothing to do with human reason.

			Reason or Logic does not imply materialism or Scientism, of course science can't answer everything and matter may not exist, but you need Logic to understand all of this.Â Â 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, you don't need logic to understand all this.
</p>

<p>
	And also, post-rational doesn't mean you stop using logic forever. It means you are capable of transcending logic when appropriate. Post-rational people are not irrational, nor do they reject all rationality. They are just able to go beyond it and they are aware of its limits.
</p>

<title>Are You Saying Reality is Subjective or Objective Idealism?</title>

<p>
	Subjective vs objective is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is nondual.
</p>

<p>
	Anything you could say about nonduality would be false, as all thought and speech is based on dualistic divisions like subjective vs objective, real vs unreal, existence vs non-existence, big vs small, matter vs mind, dual vs nondual, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Truth escapes all attempts to encapulate it.

<p>
	Love is being itself. Like the physical building blocks of reality.
</p>

<p>
	But this cannot be seen while through the cloud of smog of the ego.
</p>

<p>
	You have to die to see that all is love. Ego is incapable of such love. Only withÂ death does it come.

</p>

<p>
	Mystical experiences are nice, but you need to go deeper, beyond experience to Truth itself, which is not an experience or a state.
</p>

<p>
	There are many depths to how awakened you can be. So always keep boring deeper and deeper.
</p>

<p>
	For an awakening to stick, the illusion of self needs to be thoroughly decontructed. It's very common to keep falling back into the illusion because you still haven't fully deconstructed it.

<p>
	There are a lot of great cutting-edge physics and science lectures available on Youtube these days, so I thought it would be nice if we started to pool the best ones.
</p>

<p>
	Please think twice before posting a science video here. We want really good videos which demonstrate high Yellow/Turquoise holistic science. Find videos which are really big picture or have some larger metaphysical, epistemic, or spiritual implications. I'm thinking of stuff akin to the work of visionary scientists like Einstein, Niels Bohr, David Bohm, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Stuff that is post-materialist, post-rationalist. Stuff that's outside the box and really captures the imagination.
</p>

<p>
	Of course we shouldn't expect these scientists to really fathom nonduality. Most of them will still be materialists and still stuck in their models. But still, they will often say interesting tidbits which dovetail with nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take Western philosophy too seriously. All of Western philosophy is basically delusion.
</p>

<p>
	There is not such thing as no consciousness. Only consciousness exists.
</p>

<p>
	If there were zombies, they would be made out of consciousness.

<p>
	What is your LP currently?
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose is supposed to be the most meaningful thing you find in life. If that is consciousness, then align your LP with that somehow.

<title>SD - Stage Yellow Video Sparked Some Questions</title>

</p>

<p>
	Then after I graduated college I had to start my career and figure out how to pay my own bills. At which point I was forced to regress pretty deep into Orange. It was dirty business. Then 5 years later after integrating lots of Orange, I started to move back into Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	You don't need any money to be Yellow. Yellow is a state of mind. But if you are crippled by self-survival issues, then it will be pretty hard for your ego to go Yellow because you haven't mastered the lower stages yet.
</p>

<p>
	Preoccupation with self-survival is the chief obstacle to evolution into Tier 2.

<title>Examples for Systemic Oppression</title>

<p>
	I have a hunch this topic will veer in an ugly direction. Sorry. I know your intention was good, but let's not focus on political issues too much here.
</p>

<p>
	Notice how every political topic turns into the ego-mind justify its rightness. This is self-bias 101. The point of our work here with self-actualization is to become hyper aware of our own self-biases and put an end to them, rather than feeding them, the way political discussions usually do.
</p>

<p>
	Notice that 99% of what your mind thinking is self-agenda unfolding. Try to find a single thought you had today which wasn't related to advancing your survival. Watch yourself like a hawk. Nothing out of your mind is to be trusted as valid, truthful, or fair.
</p>

<p>
	Many people are stuck in Blue, Orange, and Green. And SD is good for showing you how to evolve up.

<p>
	That's right. Spiral Dynamics does not map mysticism. Mysticism is way beyond Spiral Dynamics. Spiral Dynamics is talking about trends within the evolution of human culture and value systems.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with SD is that its inventors were not themselves mystics. So the model doesn't account well for mysticism.
</p>

<p>
	Ken Wilber is a mystic. So he has his own models which are similar to SD but which also account a bit more for nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	As I will say in the next video, once you reach Yellow, your goal should really be enlightenment, not Turquoise or SD. Break free of the entire cycle of life and death. Put all this nonsense monkey-business to rest.
</p>

<p>
	As good as Don Beck may think SD is for solving world problems, in the end, all world problems are just a hallucination. SD is ultimately Maya. Of which you must break free.
</p>

	You guys with this Red Pill stuff... sigh... it's just garbage. It does not even warrant rebuttal.
</p>

<p>
	Reason, logic, and "scientific facts" are just being weaponized here to serve the ego's agenda. It's really just that simple.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, all politics is identity politics! That's the whole point of politics: to promote the survival of your identity. There is no truth or love or fairness in politics. It's self-survival 101.
</p>

<p>
	In the future I may start shutting down threads about JP's politics and all this incel talk. It is a distraction from actual self-actualization work.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to improve with women, go socialize with women. It's just that simple. Filling your mind with Red Pill theory or JP lectures will not get you laid. It will just make you bitter.

<p>
	Of course, because all of reality is relative.
</p>

<p>
	If you removed all the atoms from the universe with nothing left but 1 atom, you would not know if the atom was moving, rotating, or if it even had a position, or what size it was.
</p>

<p>
	It's not just that you wouldn't know, the particle would actually be motionless, positionless, timeless, and sizeless.
</p>

<p>
	When I tripped hard on 5-MeO, I became directly conscious that scale was totally relative, which meant that I as a human was the size of an entire galaxy.
</p>

<p>
	You can zoom into reality forever. Your pinky contains as much "stuff" as the entire Milky Way galaxy.
</p>

<p>
	In truth, of course, there are no such things as particles. Consciousness is infinite in all directions. Consciousness has infinite resolution and it scales infinitely. If you take 1 square centimeter of space, you can zoom into it a trillion trillion times, and whatever thing you find there, you can zoom into it another trillion trillion times, and so on, to infinity.
</p>

<p>
	You can also zoom out forever too.
</p>

<p>
	Doesn't surprise me at all. His MMA background, his macho appearance, and his comedy background makes him very attractive to Blue/Orange alpha bro types.
</p>

<p>
	Joe covers a lot of shallow pop-culture topics which attracts Orange types.
</p>

<p>
	He has a very large audience though, so I think a lot of Green people watch him too. They aren't as vocal as his rabid alpha-bro fans.
</p>

<p>
	Right-wingers just tune out Joe's Green streaks. It would challenge their stereotype of Green Libtards and SJW to admit that Joe is Green. After all, Green is supposed to be unreasonable and deluded.

<p>
	There is still plenty of Purple and Red culture in the Middle East, Africa, South America, South East Asia.
</p>

<p>
	You deal with it by studying Spiral Dynamics and becoming a Spiral Wizard.

</p>

<p>
	Me trying to argue against science with you would be like me trying to argue against Islam with a fundamentalist Muslim. It's pointless because you accept science as a dogma without being aware that you are doing so.
</p>

<p>
	If you care about the Truth, you will make a serious inquiry into the limits of science on your own.
</p>

<p>
	You're right about one thing: science is pragmatic. But pragmatism is the ego-mind's survival agenda, which has nothing to do with Truth or deep understanding. In an illusory world, illusion, lying, deception, imagination, and manipulation is highly effective for the purposes of maintaining and advancing oneself as an illusion.

<p>
	Flying a private jet does not preclude one from being Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	You really expect a huge celebrity like Di Caprio to fly public? He would be hounded by fanboys all day long. A guy like that needs body guards around him. You're talking about one of the most famous people in the whole world.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, Di Caprio seems more Orange/Green to me.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/5833-fireworld/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="5833" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/5833-fireworld/" rel="">@fireworld</a> Let me rewrite what you wrote from stage Blue's POV thinking about your stage (Orange).
</p>

<p>
	Orange Stupidity:
</p>

<p>
	The idea behind Spiral Dynamics is that you go through the stages and incorporate the previous stages into the higher ones to some extent. Given this shouldn't stage Orange have a decent amount of understanding of how religion and morality works?
</p>

<p>
	I understand that there are limits to religion and that it can be done in an unhealthy way, but from my perspective every person that i have met that is in stage Orange is extremely selfish and disconnected from "moral living".
</p>

<p>
	Take the human body as an example of a system, we know that this system called a human body operates in certain ways that keeps it healthy and strong. Proper food, sleep, prayer, fasting, chastity, and so on. But the stage Oranges seem to be extremely against any "set" rules for keeping your materialistic cravings in check.
</p>

<p>
	They will take something like casual sex or greasy fast food or alcohol and call it healthy even though we know it isn't healthy at all and is most likely going to be the thing that kills you. The same is true about business, or relationships or anything that we have a deep understanding of. Our religious leaders have long ago pointed out the evils of having a materialistic worldview. Materialism leads to a rejection of God, a mindless belief in technological progress and science, and is responsible for greed, corporate exploitation, objectification of women, sex addiction, drug addiction, food addiction, pornography, crude humor, violent video games, nuclear weapons, depression, suicide, loss of direction, broken marriages, single mothers, STDs, abortions, and much more.
</p>

<p>
	Isn't Orange corrupting the very fabric of decent society, turning it into the devil's playground? How can Orange be so stupid as to expect happiness from money, fine clothing, technological gadgetry, TV, video games, Facebook, sex before marriage, pornography, drugs, and rock n roll? Isn't Orange the embodiment of depravity and godlessness?
</p>

<p>
	Isn't this the greatest limiting factor to stage Orange? Is that they are completely ignoring how spiritual reality actually works and that's the reason they end up in so much trouble and pain?Â 
</p>

I know them all too well.
</p>

<p>
	You can do all the spiritual work you want, but the fact remains that PUA is an escape from the real inner work. When you get to real spiritual work PUA will fly out the window as delusional nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	I am not going to argue with you about it. You can figure it out on your own. All the points I made are still valid, despite your rebuttals.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, I don't object to talking to girls in clubs to improve your game. What I object to is the toxic anti-woman ideology that comes with it.
</p>

<p>
	PUA is like Islam. Good in theory but often ugly in practice.
</p>

<p>
	I know most of the RSD instructors. They are very immature and dysfunctional. With that said, yes, they still help lots of guys. They helped me. But you also gotta move on.
</p>

<p>
	The sad irony is, all these mens rights movements are way more ugly and toxic than feminism. Which is precisely why all this hatred of feminism exists. It's just compensation for one's own inadequacies.

<p>
	That's right.
</p>

<p>
	Although it's complicated. You have to understand that mystics and enlightened people tend to reside outside Spiral the entirely.
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality cannot be mapped. Nonduality is not a stage you reach. Nonduality is Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Never forget that Spiral Dynamics is just a model, and it is not designed to model mysticism, altered states of consciousness, or nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a model of levels of nonduality, Ramaji's LOC system is better suited to that. Although, still, it's just a model and will not address every facet.

<p>
	It just happens naturally as you trip. Just surrender to the trip and the substance will take you were you need to go, whether mentally or emotionally.
</p>

<p>
	I've had powerful emotional experiences on every substance. It mostly depends on you, not the substance.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms can be very emotional for me. They tend to be intoxicating and very trippy. LSD is better for metaphysical contemplation.
</p>

<p>
	As your trip starts you can set an intention to either: 1) work on personal emotional issues, 2) work on metaphysical insights, 3) work on life purpose and a vision for your life. Just pick one and see where it takes you.

			Sooo this is what RSDtyler said a few days ago:
		</p>

		<p>
			"IÂ keep fucking falling into this trap.<br />
			<br />
			I read posts like this, and I think "Ya I'm being too extreme".<br />
			<br />
			Then I meet a "good girl" and I try to game her without all the fuck-boy stuff ......... and I get SHUT DOWN.<br />
			<br />
			The girl will even say "I just want to meet a guy who runs a business and doesn't do drugs and has a level head" and it's like HELLLOOOOOO I'MMMM HEEERRREEEE!!!Â Â <br />
			<br />
			And then they go date a drug addicted degenerate.
		</p>

		<p>
			I fall back into that trap because of the negative influence of this forum and mainstream society that keeps telling me "A high quality woman will appreciate a high quality guy".<br />
			<br />
			Which is just flat wrong.<br />
			<br />
			I'm a high quality guy and I like HOT women.Â  I often date Instagram models and strippers because they are insanely hot.<br />
			<br />
			You can laugh at this and call it a flaw in my character, but when you have a perfect 10 professional hottie riding your cock.... I gotta be honest, there are few physical pleasures in life on that level.<br />
			<br />
			So if I fall into the same trap, and I'm a quality guy I think ... then i gotta remind myself that women do too.<br />
			<br />
			And stop believing this "quality attracts quality" bullshit.<br />
			<br />
			Humans are humans.Â  We like to feel super super super good whenever we can.Â  So be a sexual guy with women and they will appreciate it.Â  Stop correlating all this career and personal development shit with getting laid - too idealistic, not based in how reality actually works.<br />
			<br />
			Tyler"
		</p>

		<p>
			So does Tyler mean this exclusively for having sex and getting laid at the club? So does this mean getting laid as not orange will be difficult?Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			Or because hes too orange value system and doesnt know better?Â Â

<p>
	This is so toxic and neurotic I don't even know where to begin deconstructing it.
</p>

<p>
	That's how the world looks like when you're at Tyler's level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	At higher levels of consciousness, it does not look like that.
</p>

<p>
	The fundamental problem with PUAs is, they want to bang the hottest 0.001% of girls, a new one very week, and when that girl rejects him or refuses to sleep with him within 4 hours of meeting him, he gets pissy and blames her for it. Because of course PUA can't be wrong by definition.
</p>

<p>
	Are young women in their early 20's attracted to low-quality men? Of course! In the same way that people are attracted to low quality food. The solution isn't to start another McDonalds. The supermodel girls in their 20's are immature and unconscious and have no idea how to select proper mates. PUA then blames and exploits them for it.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, you will definitely have more sex by manipulating girls. Just like you will definitely earn more money by manipulating and cheating customers. But that's not what you really want in the end.
</p>

<p>
	You don't really want a new supermodel girl every week. What you want is 1 girl who are able to love and build a deep relationship with. She doesn't even have to be that hot. That's your insatiable ego at work.
</p>

<p>
	The counter-intuitive move for Tyler here would be to say, "I will surrender my desire for sex with a new super-model girl every week." The problem isn't that he can't get girls. The problem is that he is trying to reach God/Infinity through sex/girls/pickup, and this will NEVER work. Materialism never works. But rather than admitting that, the PUA will blame the women.
</p>

<p>
	You have to understand that PUAs are fundamentally incapable of being in relationships because they are too narcissistic and manipulative to have an honest, intimate, loving relationship. They are too immature to be vulnerable and to commit to one woman. Many PUAs are really just sex and ego addicts without realizing it. PUA becomes just another materialist escape, no different than TV, drugs, or porn. It's a 1st and 2nd chakra activity -- driven by very low consciousness needs.

<title>Whats wrong with Sam Harris?</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/23004-whats-wrong-with-sam-harris/?do=findComment&amp;comment=254238</link>
<description><![CDATA[
<span>in <a href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/forum/2-self-actualization/">Self-Actualization</a></span>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	There are numerous problems I have with Sam Harris:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		He doesn't understand what God is, what enlightenment is, what consciousness is, or what intelligence is.
	</li>
	<li>
		He does not understand the true origins of religion.
	</li>
	<li>
		He still clings to and advocates a rationalist morality, without being conscious that morality is a human invention and a weapon of the ego.
	</li>
	<li>
		He demonizes Islam by citing poll studies which are greatly distorted and misrepresentative. The majority of Muslims DO NOT believe it is right to kill apostates, etc. Those polls are just bad.
	</li>
	<li>
		He has built a cult following of atheists and rationalists which use Sam to justify a closedminded scientism.
	</li>
	<li>
		He still fundamentally holds a dualistic, materialistic worldview -- despite his meditation and spiritual questing.
	</li>
	<li>
		He doesn't really fathom the depth of psychedelics.
	</li>
	<li>
		He doesn't really fathom the depth of consciousness.
	</li>
	<li>
		He doesn't understand what Truth is. He doesn't understand that science and language cannot access Truth.
	</li>
	<li>
		He treats consciousness as though it is produced by the brain.
	</li>
	<li>
		He advances American exceptionalism, which is a blindness to national and cultural self-bias.
	</li>
	<li>
		He acts as though Western culture is objectively better and superior to other cultures.
	</li>
	<li>
		In evaluating the problems in the Middle East he places way too much emphasis on Islamic beliefs vs geo-political, historical, and economic factors, which are far more significant.
	</li>
	<li>
		There is no acknowledgment that Islam can be practiced at different levels of consciousness: Purple, Red, Blue, Orange, Green, Yellow, Turquoise. He paints all of Islam as Red/Blue. This is a fundamental error. The problems which exist within Islam are NOT due to specific beliefs in the Quran but due to lack of geo-political and consciousness development in the Middle East. All of the problems in the Middle East could be resolved without changing the Quran or the basics of Islam.
	</li>
	<li>
		He places way too much importance on the content of belief vs one's level of consciousness.
	</li>
	<li>
		He is engaging in a lesser Jihad and indoctrinating his fanbase into doing the same.
	</li>
	<li>
		Seems to me like he's making more enemies in the Middle East than building bridges. It's not an accident that he gets so many death threats. Because he's try to ram American culture down people's throats.
	</li>
	<li>
		He stokes up right wing Islamophobia.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	He is the poster-child for scientism by making claims like the following: "The scientific data can't be racist." Which is quite ignorant of what "data" is. There is no such thing as data. All data is theory-laden and will of course be cherry-picked by the ego to justify its self-biases. Which is precisely the problem of scientism, and what people like JP or Sam Harris are doing. They use "data" and "reason" to be advance their biases.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see an awareness of the nuances of epistemology within him. I also don't see an awareness of how the ego-mind uses logic, data, science, and rationality to advance its agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Sam's entire rationalist philosophy is ego-based from my perspective.
</p>

<p>
	He likes to play the philosopher without realizing that Western philosophy is dead because it is all mind-based ego games. You will never arrive a Truth via Western philosophy or science.
</p>

<p>
	And the problem is that because he presents an air of authority and intelligence, people just swallow it up without realizing that they are being indoctrinated into a religion.
</p>

<p>
	From the big picture perspective, the very problems that Sam Harris is pointing out within Islam, are the very same problems he himself is falling into. There is lack of self-awareness of the mechanisms of the ego-mind. Fundamentalism isn't just a problem for Islam. It's also a problem for materialistic atheists.
</p>

<p>
	If people didn't take him too seriously, that would be okay. But his fanbase is cult-like and really believes in it.

<p>
	You have to understand that stages Green, Yellow, Turquoise basically did not exist 200+ years ago. At least that's according to the Spiral Dynamics model.
</p>

<p>
	People from 2000 years ago lived in a radically different reality and culture. They were not like us today minus smartphones and cars.

<p>
	For starters, someone who has a sense of life purpose and doesn't play victim or whine about women.
</p>

<p>
	A man who complains about feminism isn't a real man, that's a pouting child.
</p>

<p>
	A real man has something of value to offer the woman. And he treats women well, with love and respect.

<p>
	Dating is much easier for guys than girls, so spare us your JP crocodile tears. You have no idea the kind of shit women go through.

<p>
	To expect top notch womenÂ to be handed to you on a silver platter sure sounds like communism.

	One of the best PUA friends I know is about that height. He is crazy good at attracting girls.
</p>

<p>
	He's like a sex mongoose.
</p>

<p>
	What girls care about most is your charisma and confidence. Not your appearance.
</p>

<p>
	You are projecting your caring about appearance onto girls. Girls don't think like you.

<title>Best psychedelic for improving the mind - (pls don't say that's an oxymoron)</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/23027-best-psychedelic-for-improving-the-mind-pls-dont-say-thats-an-oxymoron/?do=findComment&amp;comment=253897</link>

<p>
	I've done over 30 trips. I have not noticed any improvements of the mind per se.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		I've gotten tons of insights.
	</li>
	<li>
		I've gotten lots of emotional growth.
	</li>
	<li>
		I've gotten a deconstruction of my conceptual matrix.
	</li>
	<li>
		I've gotten crazy depths of consciousness.
	</li>
	<li>
		I've gotten massive openmindedness.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	But no baseline improvement of memory or things like that.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga, visualization, contemplation, concentration exercises will have a better chance of improving your mind vs psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	If you have memory problems, perhaps look into vitamins or nootropics and clean up your diet.
</p>

<title>Jordan Peterson on Incels and Female Hypergamy</title>

<p>
	Good God!
</p>

<p>
	Enough of this nonsense.
</p>

<p>
	Western society is still highly patriarchal.
</p>

<p>
	The reason men are sexless is cause they sit around watching JP too much and playing video games all day. It's hard to have sex when you're sitting in your man-cave all day.
</p>

<p>
	What ever happened to taking responsibility for your sexlessness rather than blaming women and society for it?
</p>

<p>
	By Peterson's logic society should ban:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		TV
	</li>
	<li>
		Video games
	</li>
	<li>
		Internet
	</li>
	<li>
		Porn
	</li>
	<li>
		Virtual reality
	</li>
	<li>
		Smartphones
	</li>
	<li>
		Social media
	</li>
	<li>
		Nerd culture
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	That would solve most of your sex problems.
</p>

<p>
	A real man doesn't blame women for his lack of development. Any guy can learn to get good with attracting women. But it takes inner work, and it requires going outside your man-cave and actually talking to women.
</p>

<p>
	RSD is really the practical solution to the male problems JP rants about.
</p>

<p>
	But of course then you've got all the problems that come with getting indoctrinated into RSD culture. Which I've already ranted about in the past.
</p>

<p>
	What would really solve this problem is if schools did a better job of teaching boys and girls how to interact with each other.
</p>

<p>
	Because Green cares too much.
</p>

<p>
	It's all about finding the right balance.
</p>

<p>
	If a mother loves her son so much that she isn't able to let him go to school (because she wants him around the house all day) then she cares too much, and her care has become neurotic. To this mother we would say, "Stop caring about your son so much", to which she would reply, "So you want me to hate my son?! NEVER! You are a monster!" At which point we would say, "Sigh..."

	That's exactly how you get enlightened masters who molest people, or areÂ secretly greedy, or dogmatic, or can't run a biz, etc.
</p>

<p>
	There is a lot more to life than sitting in a cave. If all you plan to do is sit in a cave for the next 50 years, okay. But that is not what you will do. You will enter all sorts of complex interactions with people in a complex society. That's when shit will hit the fan.

<p>
	Rationalism, materialism, scientism, moralism, intellectual crusading, demonization of Islam, duality.
</p>

<p>
	Sam Harris is stuck playing the role of an intellectual. The lesser Jihad.
</p>

<p>
	All classic traps you should watch out for.
</p>

<p>
	Writing a book or talking about spirituality & meditation does not mean one is awakened or has a profound understanding of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	If you're at stage Blue/Orange/Green, Sam Harris might be useful to you. Once you get beyond that, he will hold you back.
</p>

<p>
	There's nothing "wrong" with him. He is who he is.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Oneness is a very tricky thing. Let's say you are not compassionate, does that mean you are less one?
</p>

<p>
	There is a danger of taking on "compassion" and "goodness" as truer than "hate" and "badness". But that just perpetuates the duality. The deepest levels of consciousness are beyond compassion, beyond human concerns, beyond being good.
</p>

<p>
	The distinction between love and hate must collapse in the end.
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate litmus test would be this: when you see great hate, are you still able to love? Does your compassion extend to the perpetrator as well as the victim? Or are you cherrypicking?

	The Truth is TOTAL. It includes Nazis, rape, murder, genocide, war, slavery, hate, racism, sexism, abuse, violence, theft, and a trillion other things. That's TRUTH.
</p>

<p>
	What I'm trying to do here is show you that you are cherrypicking the truth to suit your ego. Which is something you'll have to outgrow if you really want to reach liberation and peace.
</p>

<p>
	Truth and politics don't mix very well. Have you noticed? Have you wondered why that is?

<p>
	Of course!
</p>

<p>
	Not just freedom of speech, but even self defense and the right to life.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is, you have no rights. All "rights" are just inventions of the human ego to make life easier for the ego in an otherwise brutal reality.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you value freedom of speech is because your ego wants to mouth off its agenda without being limited. Egos hate having their agendas limited in any way. It hinders the ego's survival ability.
</p>

<p>
	If we passed a law which said that I could rape your child, but you are forbidden to ever speak of it, not even in court -- that would be a huge problem for your ego.

<p>
	"When it's not necessary" is a highly subjective call. The ego always finds it convenient to do unnecessary things.
</p>

<p>
	A person who does violence to another doesn't do it gratuitously. In his mind, he feels it is very necessary -- selfless even.

<p>
	You understand -- right? -- that most of the evil done in the world is done by people fighting for their rights?
</p>

<p>
	Fighting for rights is ego 101.

			I don't see it as a survival issue, I don't NEED to be environmentally conscious and care for others to survive, in fact it would be easier not too, but then to me that WOULD be the ego? Putting ones own survival over the basic rights of other living beings? To me it seems more of an ego sacrifice to devote oneself to the liberation and protection of others
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I know you don't, which is why I went out of my way to underscore that it is a survival issue.
</p>

<p>
	The ego is very sneaky. It loves to don the veil of devoting oneself to the "protection of others" when in fact you are devoting yourself to advancing your own egoic agenda. Devotion creates a self-righteous ego which then goes on to commit great atrocities. All great atrocities are done in the name of good, freedom, liberation, truth, rights, fairness, etc.
</p>

<p>
	What do you think terrorists and Nazi's are doing? They are trying to make the world a better place.
</p>

<p>
	"Make the world a better place" is ALWAYS relative to your ego! There is no such thing as an objectively good world. A good world for one group is a bad world for another group. Which is why conflict happens.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you think you can get all of mankind to work peacefully together, that is still mankind's collective ego. Who's to say that mankind is a good thing, and not a cancer in this universe? You? Mankind? Ha! Do you see the conflict of interest problem?
</p>

<p>
	This is very important to understand. Otherwise you will still be under the ego's influence.
</p>

<p>
	Consider: the only reason you care about mankind is because you identify with being mankind. That's your ego. If you were an ant, you wouldn't care about mankind at all. Nor would you care about slavery, human rights, or anything else of that sort.
</p>

<p>
	Your self-identification extends far beyond your physical body. You identify with all sorts of abstract self-images, like the image of "being a decent human being who fights for the rights of the weak and the poor against the oppression of the strong and greedy". That's YOUR self-image! It turns you on. You get off on it. Playing this role is an addiction.

<p>
	Well... if you think about what a loop is very abstractly, it's a singular object which links back with itself via some backward, as yet unseen connection. So two ends which previously seemed separate are ultimately recognized to be one and the same.

<p>
	Try slowly drawing a circle and see what happens.
