Would you stay in a celibate relationship until be sure you wanna be with this person for your entire life? Would you get out as soon as possible? Would you remain in an afective relationship with her while banging other girls around? I am really interested in your answers.

<p>
	Well, you can do whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I would not date a girl who doesn't have sex by the end of 2nd date.
</p>

<p>
	Ain't no such thing as celibate girls unless maybe they're nuns. And even then I wouldn't take this celibacy seriously. This is an act. Not real celibacy.
</p>

<p>
	Again, you can do whatever you want. These are just my personal standards.
</p>

			Leo im so fucking confused. ive tried to understand what you mean by god and infinity. I don't see it. I can rationalise it.
		</p>

		<p>
			The universe was created by the Big Bang, the articulation of the universe is rigged in such a way where the contents of the universe advance and intertwine (become more complex) I don't see the love, I see meaninglessness interacting with more meaninglessness. yes this is a story in my head. but what could I do otherwise? Im unable to bring into my experience anything that you preach about.Â 
		</p>

		<p>
			Tell me how I can experience LOVE, INFINITY, SELFGOD.
		</p>

		<p>
			im willing to die. lose me, really I am. I don't know what to do to see what you're seeing. do you get this? you explaining this stuff to me is liketrying to explain aerodynamics to a monkey. im that monkey.Â

<p>
	You're thinking about work all wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than seeing is as something you have to do, find a way to make it something you love to do.
</p>

<p>
	In general, don't do things because you have to, do them because you want to.
</p>

<p>
	This means being proactive about your work. It's not really work then, it's creativity. Don't you want to be creative? Why not? You are God after all! You created the whole universe and creation is a beautiful and exciting process.
</p>

<p>
	You're disconnected from your creativity. That's your problem. Find a way to reconnect and this issue about work will dissolve. Then your problem will be that you work too hard!
</p>

<p>
	Your work needs to be the most meaningful thing in the world to you.
</p>

<p>
	You have yet to realize the significance of life purpose. You know it only as an intellectual abstraction, not a tangible burning passion.
</p>

<p>
	Best to keep dating and enlightenment separate pursuits.
</p>

<p>
	If you wanna date, go date.
</p>

<p>
	If you want enlightenment, go do enlightenment work.
</p>

<p>
	Dating is not about finding some Buddha to bang. You bang whoever you can and see where things go from there. Don't expect your partner to know anything about enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe if you're lucky you'll bump into a girl who meditates or does Hatha yoga. But even that is rare. And even then it will all just be surface level stuff.
</p>

<p>
	Whiting out would be past the point of disturbing. Disturbing comes first.
</p>

<p>
	If you're whiting out, you're going too far.

<p>
	Maybe you find some value in it, but I would call this too dangerous to repeat.

<p>
	You're probably just misusing it.

<p>
	That will be different for everyone.

<p>
	The limit is the point where it becomes too disturbing to dose any higher.

<title>Epistemological Realism vs. Epistemological Idealism</title>

<p>
	To admit idealism is to admit that reality could all just be imaginary. What serious intellectual wants to do that? The whole appeal of being an intellectual is to take one's mind seriously.
</p>

<p>
	So it's a problem of the fox guarding the hen house.
</p>

<p>
	An academic cannot admit idealism because that then leads to mysticism and that then leads to the end of his career.
</p>

<p>
	People who discover mysticism either leave academia or don't enter it in the first place.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Create a LP around your love for musi, not piano. This is a much broader notion than mastering piano. Love of music might not require you to play the piano at all.
</p>

<p>
	Think more outside the box. What are new ways you could sharing your love of music.
</p>

<p>
	Like maybe you could invent a new musical instrument, or whatever. Get creative here.

	Fear of being rejected, fear of blowing the chance.
</p>

<p>
	The hotter the girl, the more you put her on a pedestal, the more you feel you need to impress her.
</p>

<p>
	The trick to attracting hot girls is to treat them as if they are nobody special. And being a strong leader. This requires lots of practice.

Fake it a bit till you make it.
</p>

<p>
	Be more playful, more flirty, more proactive. Rub up on him, tease him, put your hands on him, etc.
</p>

<p>
	This isn't rocket science. Don't ask how. Just do it. Learn to turn yourself on with your mind, and learn to turn him on.
</p>

<p>
	If you need to watch porn, watch porn and take notes. Although really this stuff is pretty obvious.
</p>

<p>
	A deeper issue you might have is shyness or fear of intimacy. Or perhaps you were raise in a family/culture which taught you to be ashamed of sex. In which case you're sexually repressed.
</p>

<p>
	How do you fix that? By questioning those old beliefs to death and pushing your comfort zone and exploring sexuality. Many books have been written about sex.
</p>

<p>
	Being good at sex isn't natural. It requires practice and training. Don't be afraid to practice and train. Go suck on a cucumber until you figure out a good way to do it. This kind of basic stuff is what women avoid, but it necessary if you want to get good. Don't expect good sex to happen automatically. You have to put energy and intention into it. You have to be interested in doing whatever it takes to make it good. This might mean buying books, videos, toys, courses, attending classes, watching porn, practicing, visualizing, talking with your partner, training with your partner, etc.

<p>
	Much less important. A woman is looking for strength and leadership qualities, not looks.
</p>

<p>
	Of course if all else is equal, she will pick the guy with better looks. But in practice all else is never equal. This is why a guy with below average looks can attract girls with above average looks. He compensates for it with strong inner qualities. The nice thing about this is that it's possible to cultivate these strong inner qualities. The bad thing is, this involves serious emotional labor.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense being a hot girl is easy because you don't have do anything. You wear your value on your sleeve. The downside of this is that if you're not a hot girl (and definition most girls aren't), it's almost impossible to change that. So men have more flexibility in this department. But in practice very few men actualize this possibility.
</p>

<p>
	Most people end up settling for someone at roughly their level of reproductive value.

<p>
	The simple fact is we just don't know.
</p>

<p>
	We need more detailed research.
</p>

<p>
	And even if vaccines lead to some problems, that needs to be weighed against the lives they save. And that's a tricky calculus.

<p>
	Yeah, well, that's very tricky because the nature of reality is dualistic opposition. Being "unnatural" or out of harmony is part of the cycles of nature. It's problematic to say that war and slavery are unnatural.

<p>
	But the world we live in was created by such children. So it's a catch-22.
</p>

<p>
	The paradox here is, to have a less barbaric world we need a more socially complex, less "natural" world. The "natural" human world wasn't peace and love, it was bullying, rape, and pillage.
</p>

<p>
	Slavery is only transcended after Spiral stage Orange and above.

<p>
	Even if you raise a baby in the perfection conditions, it will still grow up to have a big fat ego.

<p>
	In practice you're gonna have to settle for some compromise. You're never going to find the perfect package. Try to make a list of everything you want in a girl, then rank it from most to least important, and then be prepared to only get 60-80% of that list (if you're lucky).
</p>

<p>
	There will always be hotter girls. Attracting and maintaining 9s and 10s is very difficult in practice. The chances of attracting a 9 with a great and suitable personality is very low. And of course looks will fade too.
</p>

<p>
	Perfectionism here will be disastrous.
</p>

<p>
	But also, you gonna determine if she meets your basic quality standards. Otherwise you will never be satisfied with her and she will sense that off you, and it's not fair to her.
</p>

<p>
	So ask yourself this question very honestly: "Is she good enough for me to settle down with? Or would I regret it in the back of my mind?"
</p>

<p>
	In general you need to get very clear with yourself about what is and isn't good enough for you. You need to be clear so that you can better screen girls in the future. So you don't end up settling for something that isn't right for you. This problem is not with her, but with your lack of knowing what you want. So get more clear about that. What are the things with a girl that you're not willing to negotiate on? Make a list.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I have a few basic rules that are deal-breakers: like if she smokes, drinks, likes to get tattoos, or is overweight. I just know that I will never be satisfied with that. So it's best to not even continue down that road. Physical attractiveness is more tricky because there are so many degrees of it. Sometimes a girl is right on the edge where it's not clear. Ideally you want her to be at least 30% over the edge. Any lower and you'll probably be too luke-warm about her.
</p>

<p>
	I've actually invested quite a bit of time simply training my eye for physical attractiveness. You can go to the local mall and just walk around looking at random girls and asking yourself, "Would I fuck her? Yes or no?" And force yourself to quickly make that determination within a few seconds. Do this a thousand times. As you practice this more you'll get better and better at quickly determining if a girl is right for you on the level of physical attractiveness. Obviously there are many other factors beyond that. But since looks is the first screen, it's important to get clear about that screen. Self-clarity is the key.
</p>

<p>
	As you become more conscious, looks will matter to you less and less and your ability to love will increase exponentially.
</p>

<p>
	Determine which features of physical attractiveness matter to you and which ones don't: tits, face, ass, height, hair, legs, weight, skin color, teeth, eyes, nose, race, etc. Get clear about what your deal-breakers are. It's a lot easier when you can screen for this stuff up front. It's very painful to do it once you know her. This screening needs to be done as early as possible.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not so simple. Small children can act very selfishly. And they certainly have fear. Try taking a baby away from its mother. Notice the fear.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense it's easy to be joyful as a kid because if you have good parents they will handle all of your survival needs for you, allowing you to play and not worry about survival. But as you grow a little bit you gotta start surviving by yourself and that's when life becomes hard and ego invents elaborate devilish survival mechanisms.
</p>

<p>
	So that ego defense mechanism rises as a necessity of life. How do you navigate a world where everyone lies, cheats, steals, and manipulates? You're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't. This is the fundamental dilemma of life.

<p>
	I don't know much about him. He seems a bit like Canada's Bill Clinton.
</p>

<p>
	His brown-face scandal I think is pretty silly. I don't think he's a racist. People just behave in crass ways sometimes when they are young.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to fighting racism the important thing is to look at the politician's systemic policies and not get distracted by superficial scandals.
</p>

<p>
	For example, Trump's policies are racist. I don't see that with Trudeau. That's the important difference.
</p>

<p>
	Judge Trudeau by his policies. Honestly I don't know much about his policies. He seems neo-liberal moderate and somewhat corporatist. Stage Orange/Green. Similar to Macron of France.

<p>
	You're not going to be able to detect the effects of heavily metals through direct experience alone because there are numerous potential causes for stuff like fatigue and cognitive decline. You might feel the effects, but you won't know the cause is mercury from your sushi. You might think the cause is old age, your drinking water, a hormone dysfunction, a genetic factor, or stress at work. You will not be able to sort all those out without some external testing.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe it's not the sushi after all, maybe it's the lead in your favorite brand of toothpaste. You don't know. You could be a Zen master and still not know such things.

<p>
	The Buddha was a Bodhisattva, who's life purpose was to awaken mankind.
</p>

<p>
	What you're missing is that a life purpose doesn't have to come from ego, it can come from God. And anyways, all ego is just a limited expression of God. So even if an LP is coming from ego, it's still seeking God, however imperfectly.

	I'm working on part 2 of the How Fear Works videos and wanted to solicit your questions.
</p>

<p>
	Is there anything you still don't understand about fear?

</p>

<p>
	The pencil has the exact same scale as the Milky Way galaxy. Because all objects have the same scale: infinite.
</p>

<p>
	It works just like a fractal. Each scale of the fractal is the same.

<p>
	Those rules will be corrupted and used to teach devilry, as happened with Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, and all the rest.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot script consciousness! This is what you're not understanding and what Sadhguru has neglected to teach you.
</p>

<p>
	Any time you script consciousness, it ceases being consciousness.

<p>
	What you're under-estimating is that Shambhavi will be corrupted once Sadhguru dies. As all spiritual techniques are. And then the fools who practice it blindly, blindly believing it to be the absolute purest thing (because you drilled that idea into their conformist heads), will end up devils.

<p>
	Actually it's not.
</p>

<p>
	From the followers' POV, there is no difference. The person being worshiped doesn't matter. What matters it the conformity with which the person is worshiped and the worshiping itself.
</p>

<p>
	Structure vs content is what matters. Devilry isn't in the content, it's in the structure. Christians have killed more people than Nazis.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you will that more people end up killed in the name of Sadhguru than Jesus. If you don't take this possibility seriously, you're not understanding the depth of what I'm talking about.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, tell that to Hitler.
</p>

<p>
	Every powerful tool gets co-opted by devils. The devil is not interested in co-opting weak tools. He want's the most powerful ones. The devil wants to corrupt the highest good, the highest truth. So you proclaiming that you have the highest good and highest truth only attracts the devil closer.
</p>

<p>
	By not understanding this, devilry is created.

<p>
	It's not ironic at all. It's precisely my point.
</p>

<p>
	I have taught from the very beginning that self-deception is a powerful force and I am not above it. Realizing that no one is above self-deception is a key step in reducing one's self-deception.
</p>

<p>
	As soon as you think you're above self-deception, you're fucked.
</p>

<p>
	This work is not about reaching perfection. This work is about constant vigilance of how your mind is tricking you.

			The biggest difference between Jesus and Sadhguru is that Isha is a step by step process that makes people more conscious.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Almost all spiritual schools offer some step by step process. It doesn't stop devilry. A step by step process is by definition mechanical and unconscious. The more simple, linear, and mechanical you make spirituality, the more potential for devilry.
</p>

<p>
	You guys are underestimating how relentless and sneaky devilry is.
</p>

<p>
	The devil precisely co-opts the highest spiritual teaching. The devil eats gurus and his followers for breakfast. This is the devil's specialty. This is what he's best at: corrupting the highest spiritual teachings.
</p>

<p>
	You've been warned.
</p>

<p>
	But of course my warning will largely go unheeded. Such is the work of the devil. So carry on with your devilry. Just don't be surprised when you open the newspaper and see devilry on every page, including the spirituality section. And don't be surprised when you see Isha involved in some scandal.
</p>

<p>
	And of course you must also realize, Isha will one day splinter into multiple rival factions who will start to fight with each other over Sadhguru's true intentions. Each faction will believe that they know best what Sadhguru really wanted. And they will have no qualms about attacking the other side. Because hey, Sadhguru is God and he told us what's right.
</p>

<p>
	If you're serious about this work you should start to notice these meta-patterns of spiritual communities. All of this has been well worn throughout the last 5000 years of history. Nothing new or surprising here. It's all duality 101.
</p>

<p>
	My only point is: don't take devilry for granted. Your mind is doing it.
</p>

	There you go again. This kind of mindless black & white thinking is precisely the problem. You have it in your mind that Sadhguru can do no wrong and that no one else can point out a blindspot. This is very thing I warn my students about over and over again.

<p>
	This problem should largely auto-correct itself once you have a strong sense of life purpose. A man grounded in his life purpose is to busy actualizing his bold vision for the world to have time for such nonsense. Most of your time, skills, and money should be going into your LP, so that little is left over for others to leech. Of course occasionally you can generous, but overall you're not working to help random people, you're working to actualize your vision for the world (which is a more coherent, deliberate, and powerful way to help others). Think of your life purpose as simply an organized and very strategic way of helping elevate the most people in the world according to your unique skill set. Which means that if you're not doing that, if you helping people randomly on their terms, you're actually hurting the world overall.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I don't need to worry about helping every random homeless person I see on the streets because my time is better invested in shooting videos and helping people via my business. My business was designed in such a way that it already incorporates that desire to help others.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, help others, but on your terms, not on their terms. Then you don't get used by vampires. Be deliberate about how you want to help people. Don't leave it up to chance. Don't wait for a homeless person to approach you.
</p>

<p>
	You're not acknowledging that it's a double-edged sword.
</p>

<p>
	It can lead to good things. But it can also lead to lots of devilry.
</p>

<p>
	It's not merely other people's problem. It will be a problem for you and for Isha as a whole, as Isha becomes a collective ego it will commit evil in the same of your saint, Sadhguru, who will be rolling in his grave.
</p>

<p>
	This is the main reason why I don't start an organization like Isha. Once a hierarchy is established, it will commit evil in the name of God. History clearly bears this out.

	Sure seems that way. And Sadhguru is great. But it's precisely his greatness which will create blindness and devilry.

<p>

<p>
	The truth is, it's really not in Sadhguru's hands. Isha will take on a life of its own and Sadhguru will be rolling in his grave at some of the things they do after he's gone.

<p>
	Every spiritual teaching degrades over time. It's like making a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy on your copy machine. It's not gonna get better. It's gonna get worse than the original.

<title>Too much theoretic info?</title>

<p>
	Yes, definitely.
</p>

<p>
	There are phases in this work when you're doing lots of general research but not getting much tangible results. And there are phases where you're practicing a narrow set of techniques and seeing tangible results but not doing much research.
</p>

<p>
	You can naturally cycle between these phases depending on what your life requires.
</p>

<p>
	You'll need to dynamically balance between the two extremes.
</p>

<p>
	Watching a bunch of my videos will fill your head will too much theory and not enough tangible results. And yet, that theory will serve you well in the future when you get stuck or lost.
</p>

<p>
	Things tend to auto-correct themselves in the long-run. Too much theory should naturally drive you to crave results. And vice versa.
</p>

<p>
	We have a better chance of simply evolving current humans. And anyways, you shouldn't be too worried about spiritual competition. There exist beings in our universe 1 million times more conscious and advanced than humans. So it's really not a race. We can only do so much so fast.

<p>
	Actually, yes. (But hopefully less of an <a href="https://www.itnews.com.au/news/linus-torvalds-apologises-for-hurtful-behavior-takes-a-break-512668" rel="external nofollow">asshole</a>).
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org was deliberately designed to be an open-source spiritual platform.
</p>

<p>
	That is one reason I advocate psychedelics. Once you have a supply of 5-MeO-DMT, you no longer need me or Actualized.org
</p>

<p>
	The most important function of 5-MeO-DMT is that it democratizes spirituality in a way that no guru can. With access to 5-MeO-DMT you no longer need to look up to gurus for answers. You become your own guru.
</p>

<p>
	The difference is that on an Actualized.org forum you can freely discuss Sadhguru's programs. But on an Isha forum you would not be discussing other spiritual programs. It would be discouraged. Very few spiritual schools encourage the cross-comparison of all other spiritual schools. Most of them discourage it out of self-bias. Most of them don't even care to understand anything outside the school.
</p>

<p>
	In the end, closed spiritual systems will not be good enough for mankind's evolution. The future will require cross-understanding between all spiritual schools, as the world becomes too global and interconnected for anything less.

<p>
	Not all things can be found through such naive direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	Here's a counter-example which throws a wrench in your logic:
</p>

<p>
	Sushi seems healthy and delicious. Eating it makes you feel good compared to many other foods. It's light and refreshing and not over-cooked. But if you take this as a sign of health and you start eating sushi 4 times a week, eventually you'll discover it gives your lead and mercury poisoning. Your brain will start to function poorly as it fills with more and more heavy metals and you won't even know what's wrong with you until you get some medical tests which finally reveal the truth.
</p>

<p>
	The moral of the story is that not all problems can be solved through straight direct experience. Sometimes you need an external source like an x-ray or a satellite photo or a Geiger counter to tell you something is unhealthy or problematic.
</p>

<p>
	Also, some things are so dangerous that it's too risky to discover so through direct experience. For example, sticking a fork in the wall socket. In this case you just have to take people's word for it.
</p>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Haha, they already are.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately advanced yogic practice is not enough to eliminate dogma. In a sense, the more successful the practice, the bigger the problem. The success of the practice justified the dogma in the person's mind. "After all, if these techniques works so well, then teaching them rigidly can't be wrong."
</p>

<p>
	Dogma is not a function content, it's a function of cognitive structure. And I don't see Sadhguru teaching his students how to avoid dogma by exposing them to diverse sources and teachings. So his students will not have an deep integrated stage Yellow/Turquoise spirituality. They will have a narrow Isha spirituality. Isha will be best in their minds. Sadhguru will be best and worshiped as some ultimate master. This of course will lead to bigotry.
</p>

<p>
	I like Sadhguru, but his programs are not designed to encourage deep, independent contemplation or inquiry. They are designed for sheeple to blindly follow. It's sort of like the Apple eco-system. It's used by the least computer savvy people who just want a simple experience. But it's a closed, proprietary eco-system. And you better expect Apple to milk you for the convenience. It's in Apple self-interest to lock you in to their walled garden. But a wall is still a wall even if it's a spiritual wall.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. Constructing temples only deepens the problem as it reinforces the myth of Sadhguru. The more tangible the benefits of the temple, the worse the problem. If I built an Actualized temple which gave you legit visions of God every time you entered it, Actualized would quickly become a cult.

<p>
	Yes, this will become a big issue in the next 100-200 years.
</p>

<p>
	But right now we have so many exploited and suffering humans that worrying about animal suffering is basically a luxury. We simply aren't advanced enough as a species to end such animal suffering. Not yet. One day we will.
</p>

<p>
	In the next 100 years our technology should get so good that we will be able to grow meat in a lab.
</p>

<p>
	You are never going to get rid of eating meat. But we could make the manufacture of that meat free of suffering. We are getting close. Soon it will only be a question of scale and cost.
</p>

<p>
	Of course we can work on both issues at once -- which is already happening. But human suffering will always be a first priority because we are human and survival drives us.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not an ego-defense per se. It's just a lack of vision, leadership, and empathy.
</p>

<p>
	Lots of people in society are suffering due to exploitation by those in power. Yet you don't care much about addressing that because you're in a relatively comfortable position yourself. If your daughter was raped, enslaved, or poisoned by some giant corporation dumping toxic chemicals in your water supply, you'd sing a different tune. All the sudden you'd take this stuff seriously because it now impinges on your survival agenda whereas before it was an intellectual abstraction.
</p>

<p>
	You would feel very differently about global warming if you bought a $1 million house and it was sunk under water in 5 years. But so long as it doesn't personally cause you suffering, you don't care much.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's perfect for the big oil companies. That's exactly what they want. While you sit around and wait, they will rake in $100 billion. Millions of people in 3rd world counties will be dislocated, famine and desertification will get real bad, wars will be waged, and new terrorist groups will form. But none of that will matter to the guys who rake in $100 billion.
</p>

<p>
	And it won't matter to you until one of those terrorists blows up your daughter's school. But even then you'll probably just get angry at the terrorist group rather than connecting the dots and seeing how the terrorist group was merely an outgrowth of the global warming problem which lead to geopolitical stress in impoverished parts of the world.
</p>

<p>
	In this way, root problems are never seriously understood or addressed.

		<p>
			I always thought that great government is equal combination of left and right, as they tend to reduce the stupid decisions made by their opposition. Is this what you mean? The average is found through the arguments of two opposites, not the one "almost close to the truth" ?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's precisely a recipe for disaster. The correct path forward is never an average of all the possible paths. Finding the right path requires careful judgment, research, contextual awareness, awareness of exploiters and manipulators, and ultimately wisdom and consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Finding the correct path requires a visionary. One who can look 100 years into the future and think in a non-self-biased way, aligned with Truth, Consciousness, and Love. Such a person must be selfless enough to sacrifice himself to show people the correct path, because he will be vehemently demonized and resisted by self-biased devils defending their self-interest.
</p>

<p>
	Progress and innovation requires deep questioning of status quo positions and traditions. Nothing can be taken for granted. What's "normal" must be questioned and challenged without any concern for social norms. In a society where slavery is considered normal, it takes a radical to stand up and say, "This is not normal at all! This is devirly! You guys are selfish fucking devils."
</p>

<p>
	Seeking to always be nice, peaceful, and "moderate" paradoxically leads to the rise of radicalism. When 100s of millions of people around the world are deeply suffering and deeply exploited, and you ignore this because you want to be "moderate" and congenial (because you are in a position of comfort), don't be surprised when those oppressed people organize and come after you with pitchforks. When they burn down your house, maybe you'll reconsider your moderate position.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is intellectual until someone burns down your house or rapes your kids. Then you start paying attention.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, this is a great thought experiment which I indirectly referred to. Unfortunately most people cannot preform it because they are too self-biased and they are not conscious of: 1) their privileges, 2) how bad life is for some people on this planet. And ultimately they don't care because all they are about is increasing their personal survival advantage, regardless of where they are situated in the hierarchy.
</p>

<p>
	Watch that Vice documentary video on Liberia and imagine that you were born there. If that doesn't open your political eyes, nothing will.
</p>

<p>
	A big part of the libertarian and conservative fantasy is that they assume everyone is as equally capable and privileged as them.
</p>

<p>
	Most conservatives cannot even imagine that 200 years ago it was only a matter of luck that they were not born slaves or terrorists. In their minds such an outrage isn't even a possibility. Because they purely see themselves as "the good guys". It does not enter a conservative's mind that he could be born a mentally crippled kid in a poor urban neighborhood to drug addicted parents surviving on food stamps, so someone predisposed to drug addiction.
</p>

<p>
	A conservative mind is not capable of such empathy. For example, an Evangelical cannot imagine being born a Wahhabist Muslim. Nor can a materialist scientist, really. Which is why they demonize divergent worldviews. It takes an extraordinarily developed and open mind to run such thought experiments in an objective, non-self-biased way.
</p>

<p>
	Rawls' through experiment is only the tip of the iceberg. It's not merely that you COULD be born as someone else. It's that you WILL be born as EVERYONE else! It's that YOU ARE EVERYONE ELSE! The moment you realize this your entire politics is revolutionized. You can on longer advance positions which exploit the ignorance and weaknesses of others. Because it's like fucking over your own mother on her birthday.

His teachings will be so outdated and antiquated as to be counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	If history has taught us anything, spirituality must be reinvented for each new generation.
</p>

<p>
	Even the language and metaphors Sadhguru uses today in his videos will be hard to understand in 500 years. In the same way that it's almost impossible for ordinary people to read Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
	Even today Sadhguru's integration of cutting edge spiritual tools like psychedelics is outdated and crude. Just imagine how outdated it will be in 500 years when we use genetic engineering to transform the structure of the human brain. The spirituality of the future will be much more radical than anything that has occurred in human history in the last 10,000 years. The next 1000 years will be nuts! It will be completely unpredictable and it will require extreme mental flexibility and innovative new spiritual teachings which bridge the divide between science, technology, society, and spirituality.

	That's precisely what I said, another religion.
</p>

<p>
	We are in agreement. He just doesn't see it as a problem.

			That's the problem with books like Conversations with God imo. It's an unverifiable and self-referencing belief system.<br />
			What is their explanation for why God doesn't just present himself veritably, rather than as thoughts in your mind?
		</p>

		<p>
			Because you would cast it off as a hallucination! It's the perfect way to close the circle and cast aside doubts that any of it is real.

<p>
	What you fail to appreciate is that God CANNOT fulfill your wish because God has no form. It can only come through a vehicle, and this can always be denied.
</p>

<p>
	By it's very nature God cannot force itself on a person in denial because the one denying God is God!
</p>

<p>
	God explained this to you in the book. Yet you missed this important point.
</p>

<p>
	God IS a closed circle. If you do not realize that God is talking through you, you're shit out of luck. Because you denied yourself, because you are God.
</p>

<p>
	If God appeared in a glowing white robe and beard on the White House lawn tomorrow, and procliamed, "HEAR ME HUMANS! I AM YOUR GOD!" Most people would laugh, denying it, and some would even try to kill it and subject the corpse to scientific testing, atÂ which point they would conclude: "this was just an ordinary human with some brainÂ defects."
</p>

<p>
	So it is imposisble for God to reveal itself to humans because humans are too stupid and closedminded to understand God.
</p>

<p>
	This seems like a cop out. And yet it's precisely true. Because you are God denying you are God. If you don't get that you're God. That's it. You're fucked. Even God cannotÂ help you now. This is the definition of devilry: you have cutÂ yourself off from God by your own ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	The truth is that God speaks to and through everything, but you must have enough wisdom to see it. And neither science nor skepticism nor proof is wisdom.
</p>

If Sadhguru's words are taught precisely 1000 years from now, it will be as bad as religion because the society will have changed so much that adaptationÂ will be necessary.
</p>

<p>
	But I understand his concern. We wants to minimizeÂ devilry. Unfortunately he can't stop a stage Blue organization from avoiding devilryÂ because suchÂ people are dogmatic by definition and he feeds into their dogma a bit.
</p>

<p>
	After he's dead the whole thing will become another religion.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Nowadays I don't read much because my understanding has gone beyond basically all books. Books have become a waste of time. It's a bit sad. But that's how things get.
