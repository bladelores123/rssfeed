			It could be the case that there is no love at all, and that the actual case is that reality is indifferent and “allows” everything, which is to say that reality doesn’t actually “allow” anything, it just is the way it is, and it makes no distinction in between good and evil at all, not just because it loves everything, but because it is just simply that way by necessity.

<p>
	Haha, it sure seems that way from your POV. But in fact necessity dictates Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	To not make a distinction between good and evil IS Infinite Love. You haven't realized that yet.

They are not qualified to speak about vision.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, some of the problems will be bad, but don't underestimate our creative capacity and our capacity to adapt.
</p>

<p>
	As things get worse mankind will be forced to wake up and rise to the occassion. Our biggest problem lately is that life has gotten so easy people are getting complacent. A climate crisis will force people to get seriously engaged rather than taking things for granted.
</p>

<p>
	It's like with Trump. Yeah, he's a monster, but it's forcing people to take government seriously again. We got too complacent.

I think his embodiment of Green is fine.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously he is very cognitively inclined, but I wouldn't fault him for that, that's just his personality/style. Being perfectly well-rounded is not the goal.
</p>

<p>
	I would just say that his understanding of American politics is somewhat naive and impractical. There is a big difference between Sprial development and making good practical political plans.
</p>

<p>
	I wouldn't automatically assume Ken has the right political plans to move the country forward, even though he is clearly an amazingly well-developed human being.
</p>

<p>
	Good political leadership is its own thing. I would trust Bernie more on this front.
</p>

<p>
	This is explained in the video: What Is Love? - Part 2
</p>

<p>
	Can you see that for a Hitler to exist, God would have to be unconditionally loving to allow that?
</p>

<p>
	If you had a son and he wanted to become Hitler, it would take infinite love for you to allow him to follow through on that and still love him despite all the suffering and hurt you know he will cause. AND STILL you love him afterwards! That's true love. Giving someone the freedom to be whoever they want to be -- even if they want to be a mass murderer -- is true love.
</p>

<p>
	Infinite Love = Infinite Freedom
</p>

<p>
	A selfish person cannot allow true freedom because he's too scared that its consequences might kill him.
</p>

<p>
	If God prevented the possibility of Hitler, God would become a selfish devil, which God cannot ever do because God has infinite consciousness and would never allow for anything less than Infinite Love to exist. So Infinite Love cannot exist if Hitler cannot exist.
</p>

<p>
	This is all very counter-intuitive to a selfish person. Luckily God has no self, so it has no problem executing it.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can. Buddha style.
</p>

<p>
	If you couldn't do yourself into enlightenment then Zen training wouldn't exist.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse discipline and training with ego. It can be, but doesn't have to be.
</p>

<p>
	Training definitely leads to enlightenment. That is the one thing all classic spiritual traditions have in common: rigorous training. Because it's the surest way to awaken. Not guaranteed, but still pretty reliable.

			What I was saying was enlightenment isnt just about more meditation = more enlightenment. Sometimes more meditation = less enlightenment. And what it really comes down to is being radically honest with yourself, realizing that the ego is a massive plot twisting machine (hence being radically open minded) and having the bravery to do the counter intuitive thing - which is sometimes dropping your meditation habit for a while. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, of course.
</p>

<p>
	But just because that's possible doesn't mean that now people shouldn't meditate more. Most people need to meditate a lot more, not less.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes, if you get too attached to mechanical meditation, you might need to back off and just chill. But telling most people to chill is wrong advice. Most people are too chill and lazy to begin with. They need more discipline.
</p>

<p>
	The average person is too undisciplined and too untrained, not overly-disciplined and over-trained. So my advice would always err on the side of discipline and training. Only for very advanced students would I suggest easing up on the training.

<p>
	I was making important clarifications, not for my sake but to clear up confusion in the minds of readers.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes people misunderstand why I do or say certain things.
</p>

<p>
	Criticize away. It is good to have feedback. I'm always looking for quality feedback, and checking for blind-spots.
</p>

<p>
	See, again, this is an important clarification to make because people get the wrong idea that I'm not open to feedback or that I'm set in my ways. To hold such a view is a misunderstanding of my work. I want you guys to drill it into your minds that you should always be checking yourself for blind spots, as I do. You need the capacity to receive feedback and check your own positions.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes people get the wrong idea that I'm an absolutist simply because I speak with confidence about having become conscious of the Absolute. But I'm not an absolutist at all. It's tricky to teach these epistemic principles because people simply don't do any epistemic inquiry, so everything just devolves into beliefs and positions for them.
</p>

<p>
	I don't really care about being wrong because being wrong is how I grow.
</p>

He's written entire books about it.
</p>

<p>
	I think Ken has an overly negative view of Green because he grew up in an era were Green was on the rise and that left a sour taste in his mouth.
</p>

<p>
	Ken is obviously way above Green, but I think he underestimates how much of America and the world still hasn't tapped into Green almost at all. Ken seems too eager to skip over Green and get to Yellow. But 80% of the population is still confused and in denial about Green, never mind Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Ken was deeply involved in academia, where Green is very over-represented. This is JP's problem too. Because they live in an academic bubble they tend to see the excesses of Green on college campuses without realizing that college campuses are not at all an accurate representation of the general population.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to focus on college campus culture because it gives them an easy target to attack without addressing the real elephant in the room: much of the country is still stuck in Red, Blue, and Orange. << that is the real problem.
</p>

<p>
	Trumpism is the result of lack of Green development in the general population. Trumpism discredits Ken's and JP's ranting against Green. Trumpism could not occur without a big collective Green shadow.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, Green has its excesses but they pale in comparison to the excesses of Red, Blue, and Orange which we are seeing in real time with Trumpism and other nationalist movements around the globe. That is a true danger to democracy, not feminist college kids fighting to save the whales.
</p>

<p>
	Ken's and JP's views of Green are way out of proportion and get the political priorities backwards.
</p>

<p>
	Ken criticizes Green from above, JP criticizes Green from below.
</p>

<p>
	That's my point.
</p>

<p>
	But the added wrinkle is this: people who train 10,000 hours are not normal people, they must already have a rare capacity and desire to do that. Having the right desire is 80% of the key to success.

	No, I'm saying people are all different. Some people will awaken after 10 hours of work, others will not awaken even with 10,000 hours. It depends on all the factors I mentioned above.

	But since the only thing you can really control is how much time and effort you put it, in practice, that is the most important factor. You can't change your genetics, past lives, early childhood, etc.
</p>

<p>
	There is also a huge difference between merely awakening vs mastery. Any fool can awaken through some luck. Mastery is never accidental and requires thousands of hours of practice. Mastery is 100x rarer than awakening. Talent is important but not sufficient for mastery. For mastery to happen, everything has to align AND you have to work your ass off for years. Which is why it's so rare.

<p>
	People at Yellow and Turquoise can still have disagreements.

<p>
	Clearly they disagreed with my embellishments of Spiral Dynamics. But from my POV, I never care about staying true to any one model or system, I care about improving on them.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Sadhguru himself says he only reached his current level due to past lives of hardcore practice.
</p>

<p>
	And even if you discount this whole notion of past lives, doing meditation/yoga since 7 years old is extremely hardcore. You say this as if this is something normal. It's not normal at all. This is the equivalent of Tiger Wood or Mozart or Michael Jackson. This is world-class levels of training and talent. This is the kind of training that Olympic athletes go through. And the only reason they can handle it is because they are already super-naturally gifted. Everything has to be aligned.
</p>

<p>
	You are never going to reach Sadhguru's level of mastery. To even think you will is a joke. The only way you'd have a chance is by leaving the internet and living in a cave for the rest of your life, never to be heard from again. And even so, according to Sadhguru's example, you'll need multiple lives to do it.
</p>

	Just keep in mind that in WWII some 40 million people were killed. During the Black Death, some 1/3rd of Europe was wiped out.
</p>

<p>
	Global warming pales in comparison to those numbers.

<p>
	Humanity can take a beating and survive. Our species is not fragile. The Earth itself is even less fragile.

	Yes, we need bold climate action, but also don't get gloomy.

	An underprepared person might start to unravel in a dysfunctional way or simply quit spiritualiy altogether, which would be a step backwards. Huge ego backlashes are possible.

			Can you elaborate on that word?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a complex topic with many factors.
</p>

<p>
	Most people who succeed in spirituality have special predispositions for it. This could include: genetics, brain structure and chemistry, mind structure, progress from past lives, super-natural senses and abilities, early childhood conditioning, super-normal concentration ability, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Do not assume that all people start at the same place. Some people are born spiritually attuned and for them awakening takes very little effort because thier brain or mind or state of consciousness is already almost there. This is just not the case for most people. Most people have huge karma to burn off.
</p>

<p>
	And of course such talented people tend to assume awakening is as easy for everyone else as it was for them. But that's like a 7 foot tall basketball player assuming dunking is easy. Of course it is, from his POV.
</p>

<p>
	The crucial mistake here is assuming all people are the same. Not even close. Genetics and the structure of your brain plays a huge role. It's as if some people are naturally high on psychedelics all the time. So of course it's easy then.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	It's okay, but notice that what you're doing is not coming from a loving and genuine place.
</p>

<p>
	If you disagree with my teachings, that's fine. Just move on. Don't waste your time "exposing", "debunking", etc. This is all ego games and will create bad karma for you.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to ruin people with whom you disagree is a really low move.
</p>

<p>
	As you go deeper in this work your mind will have many backlashes and look for all sorts of distractions to avoid doing the inner work. Yes, this work can make the ego feel depressed or suicidal at times. This is normal for brief periods and not to be indulged. It can be depressing to lose the entire web of meanings which the ego has constructed over a lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to underestimate the depth of the things we talk about here. As I say, this is very advanced stuff. There are many ways the ego-mind can warp and twist these teachings. This work requires great care.

Of course beliefs play an important role, but there are many other factors.
</p>

<p>
	Other factors might include but are not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Your state of consciousness
	</li>
	<li>
		New experiences
	</li>
	<li>
		Making new distinctions

	<li>
		Diet, exercise, physical body, vitamins, hormonal imbalances
	</li>
	<li>
		New knowledge, insights, & understanding
	</li>
	<li>
		Changing how you interpret things
	</li>

<p>
	Few people can handle a 30 day retreat. This advice would only work for someone who's already highly capable.
</p>

<p>
	For most people this advice would backfire. It would be like giving a calculus textbook to a 3rd grader.

	I bet there's a lot of Blue left in Australia in the rural parts.
</p>

<p>
	The Aussies have a stick up their ass about violent video games, which seems to be rooted in stage Blue conservatism.

<title>Can psychedelics get you to Rainbow body?</title>

<p>
	No, psychedelics can give you some amazing glimpses, but they will not do this kind of bodily transformation which takes decades of daily training.
</p>

<p>
	But then again, ordinary meditation and even awakening experiences themselves will also not give you this kind of super-natural degree of bodily transformation.
</p>

<p>
	You're asking for something which extremely few people have ever achieved via whatever methods. The only person who has a chance of achieving this is a full-time monk who has no life other than meditation/yoga. So even talking about such things is almost pointless because no one who is connected to the internet will ever achieve it. If you need guidance on how to achieve it, you will never achieve it.

And those who do are almost always talented or predisposed to it.
</p>

<p>
	This is one of those truths which nobody in the spiritual community wants to admit.

<p>
	This is the key problem right here.
</p>

<p>
	To have a realistic chance at awakening your technique needs to be rigorous and you must do it hardcore, at industrial grade levels.
</p>

<p>
	On and off again meditation, even if done for 40 years, will not be enough in most cases. It's very important to do long mediation retreats where you can focus for days at a time without interruption. If this wasn't the case monks and yogis wouldn't be a thing.
</p>

<p>
	The Buddha is a good example of what it takes to seriously awaken. He wasn't dicking around. He renounced his whole life. And that's basically what it takes.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a glimpse of what the Buddha accomplished without renouncing your whole life, psychedelics offer that, just ween off anti-depressants.
</p>

<p>
	I suggest you focus less on awakening right now and more on basic personal development and mental health, so you can be free of anti-depressants. Don't get too ahead of your skiis. There's much value to basic personal development work. That's what most ordinary people need who are not ready to renounce their whole life.
</p>

<p>
	Many books have been written about how to overcome depression. Do your research and get to work.
</p>

<p>
	What people often overlook is that corruption is a relative and system thing. In a systemically under-developed country like Bolivia there's no hope of electing a perfectly uncorrupt leader. It's a matter of gradual improvement.
</p>

<p>
	That's a deeply stage Blue country which has a lot of growing pains ahead.

<p>
	Any sufficiently complex thing should in theory be capable of awakening, assuming its got an ego to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	That's my best guess so far. It's still an iffy area for me.
</p>

<p>
	I don't see why compters cannot one day develop egos. But we are very far from that. Current AI is not even in the right ballpark.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is made of consciousness. Just different configurations of it.

<p>
	You are better off starting on a different psychedelic like LSD or mushrooms which can be dosed much more accurately.
</p>

<p>
	The key for you is to start with a very low doses and gradually ramp up. You will not be able to do that with Aya because it's never accurately dosed by shamans.
</p>

<p>
	Taking a random dose can certainly cause a freakout. I would consider that reckless in your case.
</p>

<p>
	Accurate dosing of psychedelics is crucial in this work.
</p>

<p>
	1g of mushrooms or 60ug of LSD is a good starting point. Most people should easily handle such a dose.

<p>
	It's nothing personal. It's not like I hate WinterKnight. It's just that I won't allow a teacher to use my platform to teach things I clearly know are mistaken.
</p>

<p>
	It would be like allowing someone to enter a Zen temple and set up shop in the corner, teaching the opposite of Zen. Obviously that would not be tolerated. In such a case, go set up your own school. Then you can teach whatever you want.
</p>

<p>
	No school tolerates all perspectives equally. The whole point is to exclude false teachings. Who gets to decide what is a false teaching? The one who runs the school. How else could it be?

<p>
	Femininity is attracted to masculinity.
</p>

<p>
	Being nice does not exude masculine essence.
</p>

<p>
	Which is not to say there's anything wrong with being nice. Just don't expect it to make a girl wet.
</p>

<p>
	Women get attracted by boldness, confidence, and assertiveness. And other things, like wit and humor.

<p>
	Kriya yoga might be a good option.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, if you have serious mental health issues you'd probably want to sort that out before pursuing enlightenment. Enlightenment is very advanced stuff. Handle the basics first. Usually a guru will not teach you yogic techniques until you are mentally stable and have your life handled.

	A combination of awe, terror, joy, and confusion is a common human reaction. How a human reacts depends a lot on how pure the human's mind and body are. The bigger one's shadow the more contracted and fearful one's reaction will tend to be.

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	Sounds like you were doing it in a creepy way.
</p>

<p>
	This almost never happens.
</p>

<p>
	If you are camping a small supermarket every day, yeah, you will probably arouse suspicions.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to do lots of approaches you need a large high volume area like a mall or nightclub or sidewalk.
</p>

<p>
	Places like supermarkets require being highly selective. You can't be an approach machine there.
</p>

<p>
	Flirting with a stranger is not sexual harassment. Girls are used to being chatted up. If you do it right, the girl should feel flattered and pleased about herself. It's a huge ego boost for her to be desired. Just don't be creepy. Dress nice, smell nice, groom nice, and SMILE for fuck's sake. Do not approach girls without a big cheeky smile.

And so culture will evolve.
</p>

<p>
	Rape and pilage is self-defeating because karma is a bitch. You rape long enough, someone you love will get raped. And that will make you rethink rape.

<p>
	They could, if they seek publicity.
</p>

<p>
	Osho was great at it.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru got nothing better to do than fly around and charm people. He already finished his spiritual awakening process.
</p>

<p>
	Sadhguru is just executing his life purpose of awakening the ignorant masses. Publicity can be useful for this. Ignorant masses love stunts. If Sahguru shot a fireball out of his ass, they'd all be impressed and start doing his yoga.

<p>
	Don't limit karma to something that happened in the past. Karma is all your current habits.
</p>

<p>
	Your time is better spent becoming more conscious of all your present habits, emotional reactions, beliefs, attachments, fears, desires, etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can't change the past. Work on the present.

Notice that as you draw the inside you simultaneously draw the outside. You cannot only draw the inside.
</p>

<p>
	That is how all dualities work. You cannot have an up without its opposite, you cannot have a beginning without its opposite.
</p>

<p>
	A division always creates two pieces. And what you're doing is dividing reality with your mind.

			This might be my problem. What do you think would be a wise approach to get those? I know you advocate psychedelics, but honestly I would have no idea how to get them from a trustworthy source. Also I don't really have someone to do it with, a trip sitter or something like that.

<p>
	This explains why Turquoise is inaccessible to you.
</p>

<p>
	Once you have your first psychedelic breakthrough, you will realize what a fool you've been pursing Yellow. Turquoise is where life begins. Everything else is like living like a dog.
</p>

<p>
	I would recommend that you have a psychedelic breakthrough by whatever means possible as soon as possible. Otherwise you just can't understand what you are missing. But of course responsibility for that is all on you. I cannot tell you want to do.

	You're basically not going to even understand those levels without becoming a full-time mystic/yogi/monk with decades of hardcore practice achieving crazy high mystical states.
</p>

<p>
	Those are the kind of things which cannot be written or talked about. You're gonna be all on your own. Don't expect any support, validation, or anyone to understand you.

	Sorry, cannot allow a teacher on here who denies the truth of Love and God. That kind of corruption is unacceptable no matter how helpful the person might otherwise be. His formulation of nonduality is simply incomplete.

<p>
	Anyone who denies Love as the highest teaching is simply not fully awake.

<p>
	I don't know what your deal is, but Yellow is close to Turquoise, so you don't need to actively avoid Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	All it should take to get you interested in Turquoise is a few solid mystical experiences.
</p>

<p>
	Turquoise is basically inaccessible without mystical experiences. Seems like you're lacking those.

</p>

<p>
	In your self-centeredness you interpret the message of "stop violence against women" as somehow taking resources away from men. Yet this message doesn't mean to ignore men's issues.
</p>

<p>
	You lack basic empathy for those who are not you.
</p>

<p>
	You are like a white guy in the colonial South who walks by a poster that says, "Stop slavery now!" and you say to yourself, "But why should I care about the slaves when white poor folk are hungry on the streets? How is helping slaves fair?"
</p>

<p>
	Stop thinking that helping to elevate others somehow takes away from you. This is a scarcity mindset.
</p>

<p>
	By caring about women, you will increase your care for men. By helping animals you will also help the whole universe. << this is the proper attitude. Love is an unlimited resource, so you don't have to worry about holding it back.
</p>

Expect massive flakiness.
</p>

<p>
	A good way to test for flakes on the day of the date is to text her 1hr before you get in your car: "Doing some chores and then will head out." If she doesn't respond, you know she's gonna flake.
</p>

<p>
	If she's gonna go on a date with you, she needs to be responsive to texts.

<p>
	That's due to class similarities.
</p>

<p>
	Conservatives love to use cultural disagreements to distract from class differences. So lots of simple-minded people end up supporting Trump for cultural reasons against their own class interests.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is clearly not going to help low income people because he's thinks they are scum.

<p>
	That's how it is. Takes a lot of practice to overcome that. Usually years of rigorous practice are required.
</p>

<p>
	This problem of boredom is existential. It goes very deep. It can't be avoided. The point of meditation is to face it directly, which creates suffering -- which is why hardly anyone meditates.

			Yet this is the tragedy of your situation: While you may be a world class scientist, and you understand all the physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms of red, you’re color blind and can only see on a greyscale. See, despite all of you’re intellectualizing and scientific investigation of this specific light phenomena, you’ve still missed a crucial component to what red *is* existentially. You’ve missed an experiential insight into what red is that no amount of science can help you with.

<p>
	That's a classic example from philosophy of mind / phenomenology. Unfortunately even when you give that example, people still ignore it. Materialism simply discounts all phenomena as "subjective" and therefore insignificant.
</p>

<p>
	A materialist scientist will simply not understand how seeing the color red has any importance to science. "Okay, so even if I miss the color red, so what? Doesn't change a thing."

It's more important to mobilize the progressive base.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Bernie and Yang have some cross-over, which is nice.
</p>

<p>
	But Biden does well against Trump in polls.
</p>

<p>
	Warren would probably have the hardest time. But then again, caring about what Trump voters think/want is not a top priority. They had their chance, they fucked it up, and they show little remorse.
</p>

<p>
	If Trump voters admitted their error, then maybe we could have more sympathy for them. But as long as they act like assholes and keep denying any wrongdoing, no deal. There need to be consequences for electing terrible leaders. You don't get to elect a terrible leader and then come back the next time and make demands about how you're not getting enough of what you want, expecting everyone cater to your priorities.
</p>

<p>
	Catering to Trump voters is not necessary to defeat Trump.

<p>
	I simply consider that healthy Green.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful holding demonization as a defining feature of Green. That's pathological Green.
</p>

<p>
	Of course Bernie has some elements of Yellow in him. It's hard to tell what the exact percentages are without knowing him more personally.
</p>

<p>
	To me he is the poster-boy of solid healthy Green.

<p>
	Love and forgiveness is the solution in such a case.
</p>

<p>
	What such a "test" is testing you for, is the breadth and depth of your love.
</p>

<p>
	If you fail the "test", that's okay too. You'll just suffer more.
</p>

<p>
	The cure to all forms of abuse is deeper self-love, both for the parent, the child, and the abuser.
</p>

<p>
	It's very counter-intuitive because when your survival is deeply threatened the last thing you want to do is love. It takes great wisdom, bravery, heart, and consciousness to be able to love in such situations. And therein lies the "test". Such situations reveal your true level of development. Highly developed beings are capable of embracing it with love. But of course this is rare among humans. We are a crude species.
</p>

<p>
	Deeper self-love is the cure to all trauma and injustice.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Firstly, I don't make a big deal about it. I'm just pointing out hidden consequences which you may not have considered to this action.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness is more complex than just mind/body. There seem to be structures which persist between lifetimes. Suicide could affect those structures.

			It's not like the only way to exist is by being attached to an animal host, in our case it is being the homo-sapien bodies. It is like people have no confidence in their being and they rely upon an animal-host to exist, no matter how much pain/suffering this animal host gives to the Mind. Especially when your Mind advanced enough to not be "content" with whatever pleasures the animal host can provide, be it sexual, food, any other forms of carnal entertainment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In the ultimate sense, everything leads back to total oneness, so there is no problem. But it seems to take consciousness many incarnations to get there. I'm not saying suicide will damn you forever to hell. I'm saying it could be temporary set-back, slowing the overall process. There is nothing wrong with slowing the process, per se. It's all relative.

		<p>
			Is it true to say that if many have committed suicide, it was indeed god's plan? How can anything go against god's will? If he gave us free choice, why should any choice be wrong?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	By definition everything that happens is "God's plan". But not in the simplistic sense of everything being predetermined. God's plan is a meta plan which includes your human plans. You have the freedom to make your human plans.
</p>

<p>
	No choice is right or wrong. Any choice you make is fine from God's POV. God has no desire to manipulate you and no particular desired outcome.

</blockquote>

<p>
	It's imaginary in the same way a brick wall is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	The notion of "imaginary" is much more robust than most people think. It encompasses all of "physical reality". So just saying that something is imaginary doesn't automatically set you free of it.

<p>
	Nope. Humans clearly affect nature with our actions. Even if you decide to take no action, that will have an affect on nature. It is impossible to not take action. Even inaction is a kind of action.

			This is an exercise I do in one of my classes: I go to the chalkboard and tell the class I will ask them a question and I want them to call out ideas.  I then say “First I’ll ask the males in the class ‘Tell me all the actions you take on a daily basis to protect yourself from sexual harassment and sexual assault”. . . Silence. . . The guys look confused. . . They don’t know if this is a trick question. . . Sometimes I tease them and say “C’mon guys, don’t be shy - let it out”. Nothing. . . . Then I ask the woman the same question and they give rapid fire answers. I’m now writing as fast as I can on the board and can’t keep up with them.

<p>
	That's warm but doesn't hit the nail on the head.
</p>

<p>
	Your definition is not fundamental enough. It still requires activity like "recognizing" and "communicating", which is 2nd order stuff.
</p>

<p>
	1st order Love requires no action. 1st order Love is simply Being itself.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to think of it is like this: replace your notion that everything is made out of atoms to "everything is made out of love". Love is the very substance of physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	An exercise I like to do is to look at my hand and just remind myself that it's made out of Love. This reconnects me with Love, reminding me that it's more fundamental than an activity.

<p>
	As soon as you start rating happiness, you'll lose it.
</p>

<p>
	The proper answer is: who gives a fuck? Reality is whatever it is and you feel however you feel at any given moment. Don't confuse true happiness with mood. That can be a serious error.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to "lock in" a happy mood is very counter-productive. You are guaranteed to fail at that.
</p>

<p>
	If you want real happiness, stop caring whether you're dying or being tortured. Then you'll be happy. And nothing less than that will hold up.
</p>

<p>
	Karma is much more than fear mongering.
</p>

<p>
	This topic is too complex and advanced to discuss on a forum. You'd need decades of advanced spiritual practice to begin to understand such things and I'm nowhere near understanding all that.
</p>

<p>
	If you violently disrupt consciousness (via suicide), it's not unreasonable to expect a ripple effect which cascades from such an event, disrupting the evolution of consciousness. Don't think of it as a punishment, think of it as a natural consequence of self-rejection and self-hatred. How can consciousness continue its evolution if it hates itself so much it cannot even finish out one human life?

<p>
	That's a bit questionable. I'm not certain how much of Obama was Yellow or Orange/Green. It's hard to tell without knowing him more deeply.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, the higher a person is up the Spiral the harder he is to assess accurately because there is more uniqueness of expression at Tier 2.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie is definitely more progressive than Obama, so I see Bernie as a step up for American politics. He is certainly less acceptable to the mainstream than Obama. America has yet to elect a solid, powerful Green leader. Few people embody solid Green. It's one thing to dabble in Green, it's another thing to really master it as Bernie has.
</p>

<p>
	For America to elect a solid Green leader would be a massive step forward. And it would cause a serious backlash as well. Bernie will not be well tolerated by many people even if he is elected. Turbulent times are ahead as America is forced to go Green kicking and screaming. We need to solidify in Green before we start worrying too much about Yellow. Green is good enough for now.

	<a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/18122-lfccharlie4/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="18122" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/18122-lfccharlie4/" rel="">@LfcCharlie4</a> I rejected RASA so that I could prove out the psychedelic path without conflicting influences.
</p>

<p>
	I don't rank consciousness on any linear scale because I feel that would be misleading.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that just because a book is on my book list doesn't mean I agree with it 100%. If that was my standard the book list would be empty. I expect you to read books and evaluate them using careful and nuanced discernment. No book can be trusted or followed blindly.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that spiritual paths can be very unique. Don't try to follow anyone else's way. Make your own way -- whatever that entails. My way entailed psychedelics and I don't regret it.
</p>

<p>
	It happens all the time. Tens of thousands of times per year.
</p>

<p>
	But don't assume the "respawn" is free and clear. There is very likely an enormous karmic debt that comes with suicide. So avoid it if you can.

<p>
	It's more radical than that. That's just the tip of what Infinity is.
</p>

<p>
	They give you access to God. No word or video can do justice to what God is.

<p>
	No, it has it's value. We just need to be conscious of its limits.
</p>

<p>
	If it had no value I wouldn't have it on my book list.
</p>

<p>
	Try to be more nuanced in your thinking. Things aren't good or bad, valuable or valueless. It's all in the details.
</p>

<p>
	Tools of the mind need to be used properly to avoid traps and errors.
