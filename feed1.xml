</p>

<p>
	What you believe is false.
</p>

<p>
	If Truth would only be present in deep sleep, it would not be Truth, it would be contingent. The whole point of Truth is that it's ALWAYS the case.
</p>

<p>
	Stop arguing and open your mind to the guidance being given you. This is not a point of debate or uncertainty. You are simply mistaken.

			So when you say you become god when you are on a 5-MEO-DMT trip, I'm not sure I get you. In my mind, If you were truly god, you would not be aware of anything, there would not be any "observer" with his limited perspective to observe anything and report the trip to us later on. No?

<p>
	God is Nothingness.
</p>

<p>
	But what you're missing is that Nothingness is identical to Somethingness.
</p>

<p>
	Thus, everything you see before your eyes right now is God. Somethingness = Nothingness. God = Everything.
</p>

<p>
	This is the essence of nonduality. All distinctions collapse such that everything becomes Nothingness. Nothingness is NOT a blank void. Nothingness is precisely everything you see around you.
</p>

<p>
	You are holding Nothing as distinct from Something. Which is a duality. When that duality finally collapses, you will realize, "Oh shit! Everything was Nothing the whole time! There is no difference between existence and non-existence, life and death, reality and fantasy."

<p>
	Channeling is a very common phenomenon. You can learn to do it yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Hundreds of how-to books have been written about it.
</p>

<p>
	But you must have a radically open mind.
</p>

<p>
	If you think people who a different than you are deluded, then you're really stuck.

If you need to, take some quick inhales in between your outbreath, so you can make it all way down to the 1st chakra.
</p>

<p>
	With time you will build your lung capacity, improve your exhale, and improve your visualization so that will become less and less necessary.

<p>
	Virtual reality = hallucination = illusion = dream = Maya = the Great Mind
</p>

<p>
	It's exactly the same thing said in different ways.
</p>

<p>
	What "virtual reality" really means is: a reality without substance. Appearances with nothing behind the scenes. Pure information. Software without hardware. Pure mind.
</p>

<p>
	Virtual reality is just another way of saying idealism.

<title>Consciousness is within everything, even the body after it dies?</title>

You can dye the water with various colors, but if the water is stirred around too much the colors will just dissolve and all that remains is clear water. This water cannot ever "die" or go anywhere because everything is always 100% water. There is no alternative to water in this universe. Your body is made out of various colored dyes in this water, and eventually it will dissolve. But the water (which is what you really are), will always remain because it has nowhere else to go.
</p>

<p>
	The water is not in the colored dyes. The dyes are in the water. The dyes are themselves made out of water. There is only one thing in existence: water. It just takes on different forms. You can make a chair out of water, a table, a cat, a dog, your mother, your father, your boss, your car, your body, etc.

<p>
	God-mode is not other than whatever is happening in your experience right now.
</p>

<p>
	Your very experience is God-mode. It just requires a radical recontextualization to see it.
</p>

<p>
	Currently you are contextualizing your experience as "humans perception of a physical reality". This is false. All that's required to enter God-mode is to destroy that false conceptually-based context.
</p>

<p>
	You are already in God-mode. The problem is you don't realize it yet. You're misinterpreting what's right before your eyes, confusing God with "physical reality".

</p>

<p>
	These people are so high-functioning it is beyond your ability to fathom.
</p>

<p>
	They are also extremely modest and humble. Which makes it difficult for a stage Orange person like yourself to appreciate their depth of mastery because you have confused Tai Lopez -style flashy gimmickry for proof of high functionality.
</p>

<p>
	That Sadhguru looks like a homeless person makes his mastery all the more remarkable.
</p>

<p>
	You expect an immortal human being to have gold chains around his neck and a diamond watch?
</p>

<p>
	Get real.

<title>Doesn't Self-Inquiry Imply a Doer?</title>

</p>

<p>
	There is no method to enlightenment. Enlightenment is always the case and there is no way to get to it other than to realize it right now. Stop looking for a "how". There is no how. How is already too indirect.
</p>

<p>
	It's difficult precisely because it is RADICALLY DIRECT. You are already it, yet you are trying to "get to it", which is already 1 step too far.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is step 0. The mind does not know how to take step 0 because any movement of the mind is already step 1, and so one step too far.
</p>

<p>
	You keep looking and looking but looking will not work. What's required is being. Being is prior to looking.
</p>

<p>
	Take a psychedelic so you can be shown what being is, so you know what to pursue.
</p>

The number of permanent residencies given out each year is very tiny. You're about as likely to win the lottery.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to move here is to start a successful business in your home country, then expand it into the US and hire 20 employees here. Then they will give you residency and citizenship.
</p>

<p>
	That's how my dad did it.
</p>

<p>
	As always, if you want something in life, rather than asking others to give you value, you become the provider of value. Don't ask the USA to provide you with free value. Provide the USA with value first, and then the doors will open to you.
</p>

<p>
	This is a general strategy for anything you want it life. Provide massive value to others first without asking anything in return.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want something, you gotta be willing to work for it and be super creative.

			I remember a while ago you had made a few videos about the idea that the enlightened person should be able to sit in a room by themselves for the rest of their life and be happy. Do you still believe this to be the case? Is it something that is attainable?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	An enlightened person can do that. Because with enlightenment you will realize that there is no one in this universe but yourself. You are all alone. And this isn't a problem. It's perfect.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, don't use this as some excuse to not learn how to interact with people.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful about taking on enlightenment insights without first having experienced enlightenment. You cannot fake your way to enlightenment. It's better to admit wherever you currently are rather than trying to act in ways which you haven't developed to yet.
</p>

<p>
	Nor should enlightenment be pursued for silly purposes like: "I want to be happy on an island all by myself." If that happens, it will happen naturally AFTER awakening.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful not to try to achieve post-awakening results pre-awakening. Post-awakening results only come post-awakening.

<p>
	You guys bullshit on here way too much. Stop speculating about things you clearly do not understand.
</p>

<p>
	Be here with an open mind and ready to learn, not to spout your pet theories about consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	You are being told how it is. Don't complicate it. Just open your mind to the teaching. This is not a topic to debate or even discuss.
</p>

<p>
	Everything is consciousness. Period. End of story. Stop wasting time arguing about it.
</p>

<p>
	It's your job to have a direct experience of this truth.

<p>
	Stop and just look around the room for a minute. Everything you're seeing is consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	That is not molecules or atoms. That's consciousness. Consciousness can take on an infinite number of colors, shapes, and qualities.

<p>
	Not without $10,000 of lab equipment and knowledge of organic chemistry.
</p>

<p>
	Sasha Shulgin describes how to synthesize 5-MeO-DMT step-by-step in his book, TiHKAL. But he was an organic chemist with a professional lab, unlike you, so don't even try.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO-DMT is difficult to make even for professional labs.

</p>

<p>
	With all these kinds of techniques, it's not about strictly adhering to the rules, it's about finding what is workable for you, your mind, your personality, your body. Stick to the spirit of the technique but otherwise feel free to experiment a bit. That way you will customize it to suit your individual needs.

</blockquote>

<p>
	For long sits I have several different cushions on hand and a Zen-style Seiza meditation bench, and swap between them in between various Kriya exercises.
</p>

<p>
	I find it too uncomfortable to sit for 1 hour cross-legged. It tends to cut off circulation in one of my legs, which distracts me from my yoga. The Seiza bench also creates much better spine alignment. But it still starts to get uncomfortable after about 1 hour. Still, far more comfortable than sitting cross-legged.
</p>

<p>
	It's important to find a sitting position which you can be in for 1 hour+. Because your sets will get that long. So try various ways until you find something which you're comfortable with.
</p>

<p>
	I am still experimenting with the best sitting postures for a 1h 20 min set. It's quite challenging to sit that long and then still be able to concentration in the last 10 minutes (where concentration is most important).

	I shot and uploaded the video but am deciding to re-shoot it because this is an important topic and found some better ways to phrase things.

<p>
	It will be at least another 48 hours.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	But then again, I'm using standard terms here.
</p>

<p>
	If "awake" is unclear to you, that's because you've never experienced awakening (enlightenment). It's very clear once you do.
</p>

<p>
	Mind is bit trickier to define, but in this context it means: all the thinking you're doing to try to make sense of reality. The entire domain of concepts.
</p>

<p>
	Paradox is pretty easy to define: a contradiction due to a self-reference. For example: "Everything I say is a lie."

<p>
	Life is indulgence. The key question is: Is your indulgence turning into dysfunction?
</p>

<p>
	If you call yourself an "incel" then the most important thing you need to do is to get out of the house and start socializing. Stop living in your virtual world of video games, Youtube, social media, Reddit, and online forums. Go connect with real people in the real world.

<title>The labels &quot;Introvert&quot;/&quot;Extrovert&quot; are ABSURD and DISRUPTIVE!</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/23870-the-labels-introvertextrovert-are-absurd-and-disruptive/?do=findComment&amp;comment=265623</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	You gotta keep in mind that introversion/extroversion is a spectrum. Many people are somewhere in the middle.
</p>

<p>
	For me, I am very introverted and have been my whole life. Yet most people who meet me face to face would think I am an extrovert because one-on-one I can get very animated and go into a deep conversation with some close friend. But I am terrible at small talk or meeting new people because the shallowness of it bores me and drains my energy.
</p>

<p>
	For me, the introversion label fits perfectly. And I know others whom it fits perfectly too. And I also know extroverts who are just the opposite: they go into a bar and light up like a Christmas tree. As an introvert I just can't do that. Small talk wears me out. I need quiet intimate environments, not noisy clubs or bars.
</p>

<p>
	All that said, I can still push myself to go to a bar and be extroverted. It just feels very unnatural.
</p>

<p>
	So a lot this has to do with what feels most natural to you.
</p>

<p>
	Would you rather have 100 friends who you rarely have a deep conversation with, or 3 really close friends? Extroverts tend to have 100s of friends, so many they don't even have time to meet them for more than 10 minutes. An introvert will have a couple good friends but spend hours talking to them.
</p>

<p>
	Of course, as with all theories, categories, and models, don't let it limit you. Use it to deepen your understanding, and if it doesn't help you do that, throw it away. For me it's a handy distinction which explains how I tend to act.
</p>

Or did you just pop a pill at a rave?
</p>

<p>
	Doing it at a rave will of course produce few profound insights.
</p>

<p>
	It also sounds like you have a high tolerance, therefore requring appropriately higher dosage.

	Paradox is what happens when the finite mind tries to model the infinite universe.
</p>

<p>
	When you are awake, there is no paradox. It just is and it makes perfect sense. But not to the mind.

<p>
	"The brain" is made out of consciousness. End of story. It's as simple as that.
</p>

<p>
	Where else have you seen a brain but inside your consciousness?
</p>

<p>
	Really look! It is impossible for anything to exist outside your consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Try to name one thing which contradicts what I said. And notice you are wrong each time.
</p>

<p>
	This is a very classic spiritual trap.
</p>

<p>
	Sexual repression does not work and will actually retard your development.
</p>

<p>
	True celebacy comes AFTER decades of deep spiritual work. It must come naturally, not be forced.
</p>

<p>
	People think they can ape enlightened masters and become enlightened that way -- by copying their external behaviors -- but that doesn't work. What's required is an inner transformation, which only comes from deep practice.
</p>

<p>
	This is the whole problem of the Catholic Church in a nutshell.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't compare yourself at 20 years old to a 60 year old yogi. The hormone levels are totally different. In their 20's many of these yogis were likely fornicating like rabbits. See Gandhi as one example.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	I just found it amusing you wanted to go to hell and then seemed surprised you went there.
</p>

<p>
	Negative thinking on psychedelics is bad idea. They will amplify your thoughts by 1000x.

</p>

<p>
	When you get in the ring, sometimes you'll get your ass kicked. But it's okay. You will recover and be ready for more rounds.
</p>

<p>
	And always remember that every trip is different. Don't let any one trip color all your future trips.
</p>

<p>
	Lol, then what are you complaining about? You got exactly what you wanted.
</p>

<p>
	What you learned is: don't be cocky with psychedelics. If you treat them like toys, they will slap you around.
</p>

<p>
	It was an important lesson. From now on you will respect psychedelics and your trips should go better.
</p>

<p>
	Proper dosage is also very important. Don't over do it.

</p>

<p>
	Introvert: someone who get energized being alone, drains energy being with people. Introverts make fewer but deeper friendships. Doesn't like to approach new people, prefers new people to approach them.
</p>

<p>
	Extrovert: someone who gets energized being with people. Extroverts makes lots of shallow friendships. Loves to approach new people and make new friends.

</p>

<p>
	The problem with people who glibly denounce relativism is that they themselves are often the most deluded ones, thinking they've figured it all out.
</p>

<p>
	Relativism is a stage above rationalism, but there are also stages above it.

For language to work at all it requires making relative distinctions.
</p>

<p>
	You're way overcomplicating this.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute cannot be spoken or even thought.
</p>

<p>
	Wittgenstein did not fathom nonduality and his philosophy is not worth much even though he has a few great lines to quote.
</p>

<p>
	Derrida's analysis of language is much more on-point.

			Is it really so convenient to make this distinction from this point of view? Aren't we (both?) creating our own problems this way?

		<p>
			From my point of view, this distinction is the prime mechanism through which the mind 'deceives itself', like you said here:
		</p>

		<p>
			If it feels like I'm pulling your leg over something you casually said back to me, please let me know.<br />

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's a very important distinction. If you fail to make this distinction you will get yourself into all sorts of trouble.
</p>

<p>
	Most everyday language is coming from and speaking about the relative domain. This needs to be clearly understood. So if your spouse says to you: "Hey, did you take the trash out?" you do not reply with, "I don't exist and trash is just an illusion."
</p>

<p>
	When a question is asked from the relative domain, the answer must meet the question where it is at.
</p>

<p>
	And as for the Absolute domain, it's really hard to speak about anyway. So anything you say about it will ultimately devolve into contradictions and paradoxes because language is dualistic.
</p>

<p>
	We do our best speaking about these things, always remembering that we will always fall short of the Truth with our explanations.
</p>

<p>
	Do other people really exist? Nope. But we must still live life as if they do for practical reasons.
</p>

<p>
	Is money real? Nope. But we still need to earn it to feed ourselves.
</p>

<p>
	Is food real? Nope. But we still need to eat it in order to keep the illusion of our bodies going.
</p>

<p>
	Is time real? Nope. But we still need to set our clocks to the same time so we can coordinate.
</p>

<p>
	In a world of only illusion, illusion becomes the reality.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	When you first start, your practices will feel rusty. That's okay. Just keep doing the best you can. Don't let perfectionism interfere with your practice. Give yourself time and leeway. Trust that things will sort themselves out after a few weeks of practice.

Not knowing who you are and having absolutely no grounding and struggling to feel supported and loved by God makes it even harder. I suppose the fact that "I'm back" shows that I am still loved.

<p>
	The ego likes to make a big epic struggle out of awakening. Stay mindful of how you're playing up the drama. It isn't necessary. You can trip calmly in a very pleasant yet profound way.
</p>

<p>
	Every trip is unique.
</p>

<p>
	One trip doesn't really say much.
</p>

<p>
	Do 30 trips and then you'll have a decent sense of the terrain and where you stand.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. It sounds like your dose was way too high. Stay at 125ug of LSD (1 tab) for now. Blasting your mind with psychedelic overdoses is counter-productive. You want to find a comfortable dose where you are able to contemplate and still remember.

<p>
	It's important to make your first psychedelic experiences pleasant, not sickening. Otherwise you'll never want to do it again.
</p>

<p>
	LSD is the better way.
</p>

<p>
	I don't take any psychedelics which would make me feel nauseous or sick. It gets in the way of the contemplating and it's totally unnecessary. The natives take it simply because they have no better options.
</p>

<p>
	Puking your guts out is just unnecessary with today's technology.

</p>

<p>
	"Gravity" is NOT an empirical observation. It's a conceptual scheme which you're using to explain many, many various kinds of empirical observations.
</p>

<p>
	Before Newton invented gravity, it did not exist. But objects did still fall downward on this planet. But "gravity" is way more than the observation of objects falling down on this planet. Which is precisely why it took a genius like Newton to invent gravity. People had been observing falling objects for thousands of years but had no notion of gravity.
</p>

<p>
	A cat clearly sees objects falling down. But a cat does not know gravity. Gravity does not exist to a cat. Although the cat is still affected by "it".
</p>

<p>
	You are mixing up relative and absolute levels.
</p>

<p>
	When I say something like, "You're missing out on psychedelics" I am speaking in common parlance. The plain fact is that people who have never done psychedelics have no idea what they're missing.
</p>

<p>
	Don't muddy the waters here with petty pedantry.
</p>

<p>
	For someone who's stuck thinking enlightenment is a waste of time, the proper guidance is: go do a psychedelic.
</p>

<p>
	Problem solved. Now they will be ready to start doing spiritual practices.

<p>
	Sounds like you got some inner demons to work out.
</p>

<p>
	The point of tripping is not to trip once, but to trip and contemplate consistently. Whatever fears you've got need working through.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than playing around with a friend, next time, sit quietly and contemplate reality.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take the devil thing too seriously. The devil is not other than God.

<p>
	Precisely because it's too direct.

<p>
	To want enlightenment is to already be 50% of the way there.

<p>
	The whole key to creativity is that it produces entirely new things. Yes, it builds on itself, but true creativity is always new.

	Creativity created the entire fucking universe from scratch! Creativity is infinitely intelligent.

<p>
	Happiness is being conscious of the magnificence of existence in every moment, your mind uncluttered with conceptual baggage and petty "human stuff".
</p>

<p>
	As a child, that was you natural state. Then as you aged, your mind was brainwashed and corrupted with the petty human concerns of your society and culture.
</p>

<p>
	To see the magic in every moment of existence independent of external conditions is what you really want. It's the only thing that will truly satisfy you. Which is where spiritual practices come into play. Spiritual practices help you to develop a metaphysical connection to reality, rather than the utilitarian, transactional mode from which you currently operate.
</p>

<p>
	As a kid, your mode of interaction with reality was non-transactional. Which gave you genuine joy.

</p>

<p>
	To believe in "facts" is already to buy into the false idea that there is an external objective reality independent of the subject.
</p>

<p>
	What is a fact?
</p>

<p>
	That is a good thing to contemplate.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with facts is that they are always entangled with one's mode of perception or the questions one asks. This was the fundamental discovery of quantum mechanics: there are no actual facts. There are only responses to measurements. Change your measuring stick and the facts will also change.
</p>

<p>
	Facts are in a casual strange loop relationship with who you are and your perceptual system. Such that if we change your perceptual system, or your beliefs, we can change everything you consider a fact.
</p>

<p>
	The reason people disagree with and misunderstand each other so much is because they naively assume that everyone shares the same facts. This is false. A person at one level of development & consciousness will literally inhabit a different reality than a person at another level of development & consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is co-creating "the facts", but denies that it does so. This is a radical paradigm shift from the conventional materialist notion of reality.
</p>

<p>
	To put this very starkly, when you look at an object like a tree, there is in fact no tree there. You only see a tree because that's what your perceptual system pulls out of it. If you had a different perceptual system you would see something radically different in its place. The "actual" tree is in fact a cloud of infinite potential which crystallizes based on how your nervous system pings "it". You can get a taste for this by just walking around the tree and noticing that that tree "object" contains every possible angle from which you're viewing it. Such that what the tree really is, is all the infinite ways one can look at it (not just human, but all possible creatures).
</p>

<p>
	That is correct. The bias runs very deep. It is existential.
</p>

<p>
	But not so deep it cannot be undone.

<p>
	Our life's work is undoing this knot of self-bias.

<p>
	Since it is infinite, there are no bad directions. All directions are equally great to it.
</p>

<p>
	I keep telling you guys that "bad" is a projection for your ego. Sit down and contemplate what "bad" really means when you say that word. It is an egoic word.
</p>

<p>
	Things only appear bad to you because you have a horse in the race. You are biased. But God has no biases because it has bet on every horse in the universe. But you bet on only one horse.
</p>

<p>
	If you bet on every horse in the universe, would you care which one wins?
</p>

<p>
	P.S. If it was not free to evolve in all the "bad" directions, it would not be truly free.

You don't focus on that. You focus all your attention on doing a nice slow quality breath. The timing will take care of itself. It takes however long it takes.
</p>

<p>
	Don't do yoga mindlessly. You must understand the intention and purpose of each technique. Learn WHY you are doing it, so then the technical details becomes far less relevant.
</p>

<p>
	The point of pranayama is to pull the prana up the spine. Everything else is secondary and must serve this end. Whatever that takes. Your top goal is to do the highest quality pull possible with each breath.
</p>

<p>
	Learn to think about yoga as though you are inventing it for the first time.

<p>
	10,000+ hours of industrial-grade meditation or the like.

<p>
	And even then, it's dicey. Shadow issues and developmental issues will still likey remain.
</p>

<p>
	The mind is not going to be "solved" with one technique. You need a multi-pronged approach.
</p>

<p>
	And every mind is different. For some people it will be a lot easier than for others. Don't assume all minds are the same.

<p>
	It depends on how you define "ego". Ego can mean "sense of separate self", which can be fully dissolved. But ego can also mean "the self / the mind / the way you act", which is largely unchanged after enlightenment. Changing the self/mind is what development work is for.
</p>

<p>
	There is waking up.
</p>

<p>
	And there is development.
</p>

<p>
	Both are necessary and important or you will fall into dysfunction.
</p>

<p>
	Work on both. They synergize nicely.

<p>
	You blindly believe other people exist.
</p>

<p>
	99% of all your beliefs are blind faith. So what's one more gonna do?
</p>

<p>
	No one is asking you to believe in chakras. Yoga is a practice. You do it and see what happens. It's like looking inside a microscope. No one cares what you believe. You just look in the damn thing with enough openmindness to accept whatever shows up.
</p>

<p>
	It might take you a few years of looking to really see what's there. In the meantime, be radically openminded.
</p>

<p>
	Notice, you never asked this question about all the current nonsense you believe. You just swallowed it gullibly.
</p>

<p>
	You never asked: "Why should I believe in the number 5? Does it really exist?"
</p>

<p>
	99% of the things you think exist, don't. So what? Somehow you are still able to wake up in the morning and get things done.

</p>

<p>
	Contemplate that which is in your direct experience, like, What is suffering?
</p>

<p>
	And stop infecting your contemplations with scientific concepts. You have never seen estrogen. You may as well be talking about the Flying Spaghetti Monster.
</p>

<p>
	You are not being asked to quantify anything. Looking at what a thing is is not the same thing as quantifying it. These are two very different activities.

<p>
	I am not doing Navi or Om Japa as they take too much time and my routine is already over an hour long. I prefer to do more pranayamas instead.
</p>

<p>
	Navi might be good later on if you feel like you have an energy block in your 3rd chakra.

<title>Why does the mind exist? Why is it limited?</title>

Look, it's reading this sentence right now and understanding it!
</p>

<p>
	But that's just the tip of the iceberg of how smart the universe is. It was smart enough to create itself. Think about that for a moment.
</p>

<p>
	Then notice, you are the universe thinking about how it created itself!
</p>

<p>
	It really helps to reframe your entire metaphysics of what reality is. Rather than thinking of reality as a dumb box of bouncing balls, think of it as an infinitely intelligent disembodied mind. Once you make that reframe, it's no longer puzzling that the universe should be intelligent. Intelligence is just fundamentally what minds do.
</p>

<p>
	The universe was not born as dumb matter. It was born fully intelligent. Because that's what reality is! There is no option for reality to dumb, other than by acting stupid through application of infinite intelligence to trick itself.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than thinking of the universe as a thing which starts out at 0%, think of it as a thing which starts out at 100% and dumbs itself down. So it's not that intelligent apes evolved, but rather than infinite intelligence was dumbed down to create apes, ants, humans, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine that God is a really good method actor playing an ape. That's you! <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> The method actor is so good he can dumb himself down to any level below infinity, precisely because he is infinitely good.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to think of it this: try to imagine why the universe wouldn't be infinitely intelligent. And then realize, there's nothing that would stop it. So it became infinitely intelligent. And here we are. Everything exists because there is no one to enforce any rules upon reality. So reality overflows into an infinite number of directions and dimensions.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize that dumbness is equally as impossible as infinite intelligence, you'll understand why infinite intelligence exists.
</p>

<p>
	The question you should really be asking yourself is: Why did I ever assume the universe was dumb?
</p>

<p>
	Your mind might protest: "But how was intelligence created?"
</p>

<p>
	To which you should tell it: "But how was dumbness created?"
</p>

The original Kriya involves visualizing prana moving up and down the spine, which I think is very important. Just breathing while focusing one the 3rd eye or crown is not good enough for me. It feels more powerful to focus on moving the prana up the spine. But that's my take. You could be different.
</p>

<p>
	Gamana's books are not designed to teach you Kriya from scratch. They are designed for people who are already well-versed in the core practices.
</p>

<p>
	The original Kriya book I recommended is important.
</p>

<title>Enlightenened with an ego?</title>

</p>

<p>
	It's much more common that people have an enlightenment experience and then fall back asleep. This can happen over and over again until the ego finally cracks for good.
</p>

<p>
	And even so, the mind will still be there, with all of its conditioned patterns (karma, samskaras). Those patterns are largely from the ego, so they will keep playing out the ego's "stuff" even if the ego is seen through.
</p>

<p>
	It's sort of like when you cut the head off a rattlesnake, the head can still bite you <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

</p>

<p>
	There is also the question of degree of awakeness. Not all people are equally awoken. Some are far more awoke than others. Most so-called "enlightened" people are only mildly awake.

<title>Kriya Yoga Mega-Thread</title>

<p>
	Do your pranayamas slow and deep. When you get good, one inhale should last like 30 seconds, then 30 seconds for the exhale.
</p>

<p>
	You want to slow your breath down as much as possible.
</p>

<p>
	In certain meditative traditions they try to slow down the breath down to 1 breath per minute. That's sorta the goal here. Make each breath count. Really visualize & feel that prana flowing up the spine, through each chakra and up the brain stem. That's the key IMO. You are rewiring the brain stem, the reptilian part of your brain which keeps egoic consciousness locked in.
</p>

<p>
	As your practice improves your breathing should slow down and deepen, your visualization should become more clear and precise and filled with feeling.
</p>

<p>
	Practice slowing down your intake of air as much as possible, and practice perfecting your visualization.
</p>

<p>
	That should give you 80% of your results.
</p>

			The book says not to do Kriya Supreme Fire until one is able to hold it for at least 90 seconds. For now I can't even hold it for a minute. So at the moment I haven't started Supreme Fire yet, I'm only doing the rest of the routine stack, and I'm practicing holding the breath to get to 90 seconds over time. Did you start doing Supreme Fire anyway holding it for as long as you could and then built up to 90 seconds over time, or did you practice holding the breath first with preliminary techniques like Kriya Bow?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I would just start it where you're at, and you will work up to 90 seconds pretty easily within a month of practice.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let perfectionism get in the way of learning the practices. Tis better to do yoga poorly than not at all. Within a few months all of these complicated-seeming techniques will become second-nature.

</p>

<p>
	Wipe the slate clean and start your contemplation on this question again.
</p>

<p>
	Do that every day for 7 days and see what happens.
</p>

<p>
	You could contemplate that question every day for the next year and still not exhaust it.

</p>

<p>
	There is a fine line between smoking and vaporizing. Proper vaporization is tricky to acheive. Which is why I prefer plugging.
</p>

<p>
	Placing the 5-MeO on some herb (not weed but something neutral like mullein) will make vaporizing a lot easier. A glass pipe like the Glass Vapor Genie is ideal for that.
</p>

<p>
	I'm doubt 5-MeO will vaporize in a cheap electronic vaporizor.

</p>

<p>
	I usually ponder for a minute, then write a bit down. Then ponder for another minute, then write a few more sentences. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	You can write quite a lot once you're on a roll. But be careful not to write blindly without contemplating. Your writing must be grounded in direct experience, or it will devolve into spectualation and grand theory-building.
</p>

<p>
	Don't just ponder in your head, also ponder on the page.

<title>Are context and content actually one?</title>

<p>
	Content and context are actually distinct things. But that is a challenging topic for another day.
</p>

<p>
	In that video I didn't actually get into what context is. I only defined it loosely for the purposes of explaining the phenomenon of recontextualization.
</p>

<p>
	To really understand context, you will have to contemplate: What is context?
</p>

<p>
	It's a lot more profound than people realize.
</p>

<p>
	In the ultimate end, everything is ONE, but it is very good to look at context in isolation.
</p>

Notice how differently Deepak responds to Trump vs the way Green might respond to Trump: by hating Trumping.
</p>

<p>
	Green hates on haters.
</p>

<p>
	Turquoise loves on haters.
</p>

<p>
	That's a very significant paradigm shift and takes a lot of consciousness, development, and selflessness to embody. Green is not there yet. Green's ego is still too triggered by Blue/Orange to see the bigger picture.

<p>
	Just hanging around Green people, or even just listening to Green people can be very helpful for outgrowing Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Check out the Youtube Channel, Majority Report. They are very Green and love to ridicule Orange.
</p>

<p>
	Just be careful not to get trapped in Green.

	That's where the hard spiritual work begins.

<p>
	That's why you have Vipassana, yoga, Actualized.org and all these other "silly" practices and theories.

	It's easy to feel spiritual for 10 hours on 500ug of LSD. The real trick is grounding that level of consciousness into everyday life.
