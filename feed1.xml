</p>

<p>
	But Twitter? Dude, this is like looking for sex under a bridge.

<title>Making The Podcast Rounds -- Need Your Suggestions</title>

<p>
	So I've started opening myself up more to doing interviews and appearances on other podcasts and channels.
</p>

<p>
	Today I recorded a 2hr conversation with Charlie from Charisma On Command. Not sure yet when he will publish it but I'll let you know.
</p>

<p>
	But anyhow, I am gonna try to do more public appearances over the next year. If you have any favorite podcasts or YT channels that you watch which you think would be suitable and open to have deep conversations about the kind of topics I talk about, please share links below. Ideally include a brief explanation/description of why you think it's a good fit.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that I am not looking to do confrontational debates against ideologues. To do an interview/convo the owner of the podcast or YT channel needs to demonstrate a high degree of openmindedness and meta-cognition, otherwise it will mostly be a waste of time.
</p>

	Haha! How naive. The majority of the world's wealth was accumulated through theft, exploitation, lies, deception, fraud, tax evasion, corruption, bribery, monopoly, backstabbing, extortion, slavery, murder, assassination, and war.
</p>

<p>
	Where did Trump get all his money? Hint: It wasn't through providing massive value to the world. Look at all the richest men in the world. Every single one of them stole or exploited to get it -- if not worse. It is impossible to earn a billion dollars without some serious, world-class levels of exploitation. Only a deeply selfish and unconscious man could stomach it.

<p>
	Because most guys are so lame. When she finally meets an awesome guy who knows how to stimulate her emotions it will be a no-brainer.
</p>

<p>
	Most guys don't even know how to fuck a girl properly.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to women, most guys are as interesting as a DMV application.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Because doing a street approach takes balls. For every 99 online approaches she gets 1 real life approach. The real life approach is an honest signal. Very few guys can pull it off well. If you can pull it off well you automatically place yourself first in the line into her pants.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you hate doing real life approaches is precisely the thing that makes them so effective. They cull out all the losers and pussies.
</p>

<p>
	If you're wise you should want approaching hot girls to be as difficult as possible. So that nobody else does it but you.
</p>

<p>
	When you take the easiest path, so does everyone else, and you all end up with scraps. But he who takes the hardest path ends up with the whole pie all to himself.

<title>Day game: minimizing flakes</title>

			So I'm getting a lot of flakes and it is frustrating.
		</p>

		<p>
			One accepted my offer to take a walk and get coffee and stopped responding. Another one, doesn't respond to my text at all.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Flake rate is high regardless of what you do. It's a numbers game. Even a 5% close rate would be awesome.
</p>

<p>
	But of course you can improve your conversion rate. Always push for an instant coffee date. If you can get her into an instant coffee date this will increase your rate a lot.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest problem is that you need more time with her to build a connection. This is very hard to do in 5 minutes. So the more time you can persuader her to spend with you, getting to know you, the more of an impact you'll have and the more she will remember you when you text.
</p>

<p>
	Also keep in mind many attractive girls have boyfriends. You should screen them for it early on so as not to waste your time. If she has a boyfriend she will not text you back. Don't waste your time. Screen girls.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			At one point she said she was in a hurry, so I started to wrap things up, tell her I want to take her to get a coffee: she accepts.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Push for instant coffee. Don't let her run off with empty promises. A promise from a girl is less than worthless.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">

	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			I yell at her to text me back but she just ignores me. She had earphones in though.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Never do that. You clearly failed to attract her and she was just looking for any excuse to leave without a hassle. Yelling at her to call you back is needy as fuck and therefore she never will.
</p>

<p>
	Girls will give out their number easily just to get to you leave them alone. So shooting for numbers is pointless. You need to shoot for building attraction and connection. If you don't build attraction + connection the number is useless. One deep connection is worth 50 numbers.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			I'm starting to see a pattern. When shit starts getting real and we are making plans girls always flake on me. I don't really know what I'm doing wrong.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Two things:
</p>

<p>
	1) Nothing is going wrong per se. Most girls will simply not sleep with you no matter how good you are. Just increase your numbers.
</p>

<p>
	2) You are not grabbing her attention enough. You are not being attractive enough. You are not being memorable enough. You are not building connection enough. You are not stimulating her emotionally enough. You are not being fun and playful enough. You are not telling her enough about yourself.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Probably it is the neediness? Maybe something else? I'm trying not to be needy but it is hard not to pretend to be needy when I'm simply needy. To be clear: in the conversations I'm not needy but they just can sense it.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The bigger problem is simply lack of building connection. She has little reason to call you back because in her mind you take up as much mental real estate as an ant. You need to do something to grab her attention and get her invested in you. Your job is to give her a strong sense of who you are, how cool you would be to date, how lucky she would be to date you. But without saying that explicitly. Tell more cool and interesting stories about yourself. You need to strike a chord with her and draw her in with interesting stories that display your value. For example, tell her about cool places you've traveled to, spiritual work you're doing, business projects you're working on, your dreams, etc.
</p>

<p>
	And, of course, flirt with her and make her laugh.
</p>

<p>
	Because it doesn't matter.
</p>

<p>
	And casting pearls before swine is exhausting.
</p>

<p>
	Helping lots of people requires accumulating power, which is antithetical to Truth, Consciousness, and Love.

<p>
	It's hard to say for sure.
</p>

<p>
	Depends on many factors.
</p>

<p>
	I would make sure to exhaust all material options first. Don't use a spiritual technique to heal what can be healed at the material level.

<p>
	Yes
</p>

<p>
	But it must be a DMSA provoked urine test.
</p>

<p>
	If DMSA yields heavy metals in your urine you know for sure it came from your body.
</p>

<p>
	But still, this test does not tell you how much is stored in your body. It only tells you how much you pissed out.
</p>

<p>
	There is no test that can tell you your entire body load. So you keep detoxing until one day your piss comes out clean.

<p>
	Not necessarily.
</p>

<p>
	You need a urine test. The urine test is the only objective measure. You can't rely on negative side-effects. I have almost never felt any negative side effects from detox, but I benefited from it greatly and my urine was objectively toxic from the start.
</p>

<p>
	By being lazy and cheap with the testing you end up costing yourself more in the end.
</p>

<p>
	I also would not trust ALA by itself. You need DMSA too. It's crucial in my opinion.
</p>

<p>
	Detox is a thing that needs to be done rigorously, not half-assed. By half-assing it you will not get clear results and soon quit. Detox is a long-term investment. It is not an effortless magic pill.
</p>

<p>
	Just the way you read my posts betrays how selfish your perceptions of me are. Hence why should I care about your approval when it is more about you than about me?

<p>
	It's not about hate.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta feel the sting of your errors so you stop doing it. Your actions with hot women are precisely backwards, which is why you get no results.
</p>

<p>
	Stop supplicating to beautiful women, grow a spine, and you will start to see results. Although not via some Twitter attention whore. Get your vaccine and start talking to women face to face if you want to improve your game.
</p>

<p>
	Trying to weasle your way into a girl's pants via Twitter is no good.

<p>
	Where do you think the desire to train comes from?

<p>
	To answer your question go talk to a donkey about trigonometry. See how far you get. While you're at it, ask him about spirituality.

<p>
	You don't need dick extension surgery if you are hung like Mark Wahlberg in Boogie Nights.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone doing professional sports is exceptionally genetically gifted. Such people are in the top 1% of the bell curve. If they weren't they would not even have a chance to compete. Merely the cost of entry into that arena is having top 1% genetics. This is true of all sports. Which is why all competitive sports are stupid. All you're doing is comparing genetic lottery numbers while telling yourself how good you are. You are only that good because you had the foundation to be that good. You didn't create the foundation, God gave it to you.
</p>

<p>
	This is true of all the world's greatest mystics. The dirty secret is that they didn't do it, they were given it. And Bashar is no exception to this. The idea that some technique will replace the right foundation is one of the greatest scams in human history. Foundation will always trump technique and effort.

			Hi <a contenteditable="false" data-ipshover="" data-ipshover-target="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/?do=hovercard" data-mentionid="1" href="https://www.actualized.org/forum/profile/1-leo-gura/" rel="">@Leo Gura</a>! I have a few questions after watching the new video about survival.
		</p>

		<p>
			1. What are some ways to change up our ingrained patterns and habits?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There's no shortcut to Just do it
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			2. What specific things did you do to stop craving external approval? Looking for a "relative" solution because I'm still handling my survival and am probably years away from any meaningful degree of enlightenment.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I try to replace feelings of love I get from hearing approval with my own internal love generated by my spiritual connection to consciousness itself.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, cut off external feelings of love and reground your sense of love directly in consciousness and being. Or you could reground love into the doing of your art/work. Also, I remind myself that people who praise me are usually not very conscious and only do so out of selfishness. If I was a rapist no one would praise me. And there is no reason why I deserve any more praise now than if I was a rapist. So people's praise of me has nothing to do with reality. It's just their self-biased projections -- which I have little interest in. My love cannot be grounded in the projections of others.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			3. Can efficient survival methods disguise as passions? For example: someone really enjoys basketball, spends hours playing it every day, and dreams about being an amazing basketball player, while studying the more boring engineering in college – fits the passion narrative. They become really good at it, maybe one of the best at their school. But upon introspecting they realize they've pushed themselves to excel at basketball because it was their way to gain status and approval from guys and girls in high school and college ("omg look how good he is at basketball!"),
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's very common.
</p>

<p>
	However, that can lead to a genuine passion. Or not. It depends.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			and that it's not that meaningful to them
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	But it could be meaningful to them. Or it could not. If it is not, then obviously there's a problem. But if it becomes genuinely meaningful then it's less of a problem.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Is basketball that person's passion?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Usually a passion is not something that raises much doubt in your mind. If you're very doubtful about it, then it probably isn't your passion. But if you just love the thing for no good reason -- that's a sign of genuine passion. You love it for its own sake -- that's passion.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			4. It seems like our "authentic self" is just a collection of past experiences and can change a lot.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Indeed
</p>

<p>
	But there is also a kernel to the psyche's personality which does not change, it only gets obscured like the sun on a cloudy day.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			Let's say someone wanted to be an artist, but had to go into business after college due to circumstances, which was much less enjoyable than art. Eventually they learned to enjoy business and made it meaningful and impactful in a positive way (life purpose), maybe even incorporating a little bit of art into it. Does it really make sense at this point to say they're authentically an artist?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Again, it depends. The person could have stumbled into a second passion or even a higher passion. You can have multiple passions and you can also find higher passions than your existing ones. But it's also very common that a person will talk themselves out of truly pursing their passion (like art) because it is not as practical or "realistic" as something like business. They can also be interested in business, but deep down they know that business is not truly as exciting as art. But they are too scared to drop business and go all-in on art. So they talk themselves into settling for business.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming an artist requires way more courage than becoming a businessman.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If you need some authority figure to tell you that Mastery is a powerful book, you got some serious problems with your head.

<p>
	Stop seeking popular stuff. Popular stuff is designed for morons. Which is why it became popular. Because most people are morons.

<p>
	To anyone reading this and learning about Turquoise, be warned that most of the examples in this thread are not Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	Go read the SD book Turquoise section.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightened people are not automatically Turquoise. It is a dangerous mistake to assume so. Awakening and cognitive development are not the same thing.
</p>

<p>
	Examples of Turquoise are difficult to cite because A) they are quite rare, and B) the people citing them are themselves not Turquoise so they don't understand what they are citing.

<p>
	1) Many programmers lead very unhealthy lifestyles. And they will pay for it long-term.
</p>

<p>
	2) Some people have stronger energy/health just naturally and can work twice was much as other people. Genetics plays a big role. Do not just assume that all humans have the same stamina. Some people have way more stamina than others. And the food you eat over your lifetime greatly affects this too.
</p>

<p>
	3) People who work that much often end up sick or burned out after 10 years.

	Don't think of it as delusion, think of it as a Universal Mind dreaming. Minds dream. That's what it do.

<p>
	It's not a matter of being on psychedelics, or how many times. It's a matter of being conscious of what reality is. You are not yet conscious of what it truly is.

<p>
	Yes, because you have not realized yet what Truth is.
</p>

<p>
	Your doubts are perfectly understandable, but ultimately silly and misguided. And unfortunately there is no way to get you to realize that until you have a deep awakening. Until then you may think that enlightenment could be a self-deception, but that is your self-deception.

<p>
	I know what you're doing and why you're doing it.
</p>

<p>
	But what you don't understand yet is that Absolute Truth exists.
</p>

<p>
	You have not discovered some brilliant flaw in enlightenment. Haha.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Truth cannot be doubted, since it is the source of your doubting ability.

<p>
	Something is fundamentally broken. The ego-mind has fragmented reality into pieces. Wholeness is missing. Which is why happiness and peace is missing. Restoring that wholeness requires working on yourself.
</p>

<p>
	Be ware of people who poo-poo personal development.
</p>

<p>
	And of course there are many ways of doing personal development dysfunctionally.
</p>

<p>
	The question isn't whether you should do personal development or not. The question is, what is the proper way to do?

<p>
	When you are highly conscious you become stronger at maintaining your values and not compromising on them. Integrity increases with consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Don't confuse Love with pleasing people or feminine compassion. Sometimes Love is harsh and brutal, as in masculine compassion.
</p>

<p>
	A few weeks ago I got into a such an fight with my dentist because he refused to give me a refund for his incompetent work that they were ready to call the police on me. Hehe... I nearly knocked his door down. Walked away with a $1500 refund.
</p>

<p>
	Sometimes you gotta bash some doors in to get your way because some people do not understand anything else. And none of this is incompatible with Love or consciousness. Of course the door was dashed only as a last resort when other more conscious options were exhausted. Don't be afraid to bash a door down when the situation calls for it.
</p>

<p>
	Love and Consciousness != meekness
</p>

<p>
	No politician in the US has pushed for literal forced vaccinations.
</p>

<p>
	The "force" in this case is just peer pressure and public shaming. And perhaps some businesses like airlines and stadiums might require it to give you services. Which I think is perfectly natural and healthy.
</p>

<p>
	Since most Covid deniers are sheep, I think they will eventually just conform and get the vaccines once everyone else does and there are no problems.

<p>
	We have had forced vaccinations for the last 100 years.
</p>

<p>
	All school children are forced to get vaccines to enter school. University too. I had to get a shot to enter university.
</p>

<p>
	Society is held together by force sometimes. That is a precondition for having nice things. You have never been free do endanger others in a society. Because all our lives are at stake and we are in the same fucking boat. If Covid hasn't made that clear to you, I don't know what will.

<p>
	The new Actualized Clips channel has just launched.
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFc8wPBHyLl_cJphb6hDSIw/videos" rel="external nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFc8wPBHyLl_cJphb6hDSIw/videos</a>
</p>

<p>
	It only has 10 clips so far, but there will be daily releases of more clips and within a few months it will have 100s of clips.
</p>

<p>
	Strictly-speaking there is no new content on the clips channel. It's just my long episodes clipped up. But if you are too impatient to watch the long-assed episodes, these clips give you the highlights. It also makes it easier to share with friends and family.
</p>

<p>
	Constructive feedback welcomed. My editor and I are still working to polish this channel up, so expect the clips to get better over time as we learn what works and what doesn't.
</p>

<p>
	Subscribe and hit the Bell if you want to get notifications for new clip releases.
</p>

<p>
	His claims strike me as generic platitudes.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing actionable in what he said. You cannot actually use his advice to reach DMT levels of consciousness. He does not tell you how to actually do it. He just says believe in yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You could listen to Bashar for 5 hours or you could just smoke some DMT. See which one gets you more consciousness.

<p>
	Destiny's whole attitude was disrespectful and insulting. He acted as though Wolff's position and definition of socialism is obscure or unclear, when even a bit of basic watching of Wolff's videos will clearly tell you how he defines socialism. Asking Wolff to define socialism shouldn't have even been a point of debate since Destiny should have done his homework and already been well-aware that Wolff is advocating for democracy at the workplace. It's even in the name of his damned YT channel.
</p>

<p>
	Destiny came off as a bratty, pouting child, feigning ignorance of what is meant by socialism.

<p>
	Think of it like this: anyone can go to the gym and put on muscle. Everyone's body can naturally create testosterone -- even women! But you will never naturally achieve this look:
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="ronnie01.jpg" class="ipsImage ipsImage_thumbnailed" data-fileid="34535" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/monthly_2021_04/ronnie01.jpg.e791eb5f5e4971e3b346b90e204f9f81.jpg" style="width:300px;height:auto;" />
</p>

<p>
	Your body cannot produce that much natural testosterone. And to tell newbies that it can is utterly irresponsible and misleading.
</p>

<p>
	No gym technique will give you that look. The only way to get that look is to inject testosterone.
</p>

<p>
	If you insist on going "all natural" -- fine. But you will not be as conscious as one who takes psychedelics. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
	You are like a woman thinking you can be Ronnie Coleman while drinking your soy as long as you hit the gym hard enough. No!
</p>

<p>
	Shinzen Young did 40 years of professional meditation. I can be more conscious than him in 15 minutes. That is the reality of how this works. You can make all the rationalizations you want, but the brute reality remains.
</p>

<p>
	A good example of how both sides are failing to communicate and understand each other in a Game A rather than Game B manner. Both are acting cocky without trying to hear the important points made by the other. Destiny acts more cocky and fails to allow space for a new system to be considered. Wolff fails to appreciate that the best elements of capitalism will not go away, they will be used as the foundation for what comes next. And what comes next will not be limited to socialism.
</p>

<p>
	The solution will not be capitalism or socialism. It will be a higher level emergent which integrates the best elements of both in a holistic and harmonious way.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Over 100 million doses of vaccine have been administered. If there were significant deaths we would know about it. No one is keeping that a secret. And vaccine deaths are not gonna be delayed by months and years. They would happen rapidly.
</p>

<p>
	There have only been a total of 32 million cases of Covid in the US. Covid spreads much slower than the vaccine.
</p>

<p>
	For the vaccine to warrant not being taken it would have to have killed sometime like 1 million people by now. Which just shows you how absurdly out of reason the anti-vax fearmongering is. I don't know if there's even been 10 people who died from the vaccine. And you'd need 1 million of them to make a reasonable case against it. Even 10,000 vaccines deaths would not be a reasonable case.
</p>

<p>
	100 million doses is such a huge number that the mind has difficulty reasoning about it properly. Out of 100 million, more people will die from eating lettuce or slipping on ice than taking the vaccine.
</p>

<p>
	What is the point of injecting it if you can just plug it? Needless danger.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA is notoriously impure. Injecting a substance which is only 85% pure into your bloodstream is dumb. Injection requires extremely pure chemicals. 99%+ purity. MDMA is never above 85% purity at best, and much lower at worst.
</p>

<p>
	MDMA is also one of the few psychedelics you can realistically overdose on and kill yourself. MDMA can also permanently change the wiring of your brain -- and not in a good way.

<p>
	All you gotta do is look at the number of people who died from Covid vs number of people who died from the Covid vaccine.
</p>

<p>
	It's not even close.
</p>

<p>
	Case closed.
</p>

<p>
	And Covid produces more side-effects and long-term health complications too! It's not just death. The side-effects from Covid are much worse than the side-effects from the Covid vaccine. And that doesn't even factor in the economic costs of people not getting vaccinated.
</p>

<p>
	Don't forget, if you wind up in the hospital, you lose $5000 right there. Not even counting the time you lose which you could be spending on your life purpose.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I made no such point.
</p>

<p>
	One's growth is irrelevant when the topic at hand is the state of consciousness acheivable via DMT. The state is the state. Whether you benefit from it or not is irrelevant. How long it lasts is irrelevant. You cannot acheive that state "naturally". You can acheive higher states naturally, but not that high. Not even close.
</p>

<p>
	People who say they can have simply never had a serious DMT breakthrough. They don't know what they are talking about and they have no idea what consciousness is capable of on a vaped DMT peak. It is nothing a human can imagine or will into being. It would be easier to grow your dick by 6 inches than to will yourself into a DMT peak.
</p>

<p>
	No yogi, nor meditator, nor enlightened person is able to do that. No technique will get you there.

<p>

<p>
	I don't like Lacan. It's needlessly complicated and confusing.
</p>

<p>
	There is only one thing: consciousness. Consciousness imagines EVERYTHING. The end.

</p>

<p>
	Finding your niche is a journey and an ordeal. Don't give up and don't settle for a dead end job. You can get a wage job to hold you over but your eyes must be towards finding your niche, where the work you do fits your values and your talents.
</p>

<p>
	You have to think outside the box. I knew a guy who was a nature hiking guide in Wyoming or Montana. He lived a simple life in mountains and in the summers he would give hiking and canoo tours to tourists.
</p>

<p>
	Find your niche. It doesn't have to be in the city.
</p>

<p>
	I knew another guy who quit Wall Street to travel around the country doing Japanese swordfighting and Zen meditation. He lived and slept out of his van. He made money as a roving massage therapist.

	You are EVERYTHING, which means you are every asshole and rapist who ever lived. Get used to it. Stop judging reality, since you are it.

	You are not going to create a DMT breakthrough by will. To feed newbies this idea is beyond irresponsible. That's like telling a Covid patient he can cure himself by will, and if he can't, he's just not trying hard enough.

Do not discourage regular people from getting the vaccine. This is irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
	No one has ever said that vaccines don't have some very rare side effects. Every medicine and chemical has rare side effects. That is not sufficient reason to discourage their use for average people.
</p>

<p>
	If you fed peanuts to 100 million people, some would have severe reactions. That is not a case against peanuts.

	The bottom line is: if she isn't horny for you, you've done something wrong somewhere earlier in the process.

<p>
	Obviously yes. Nothing I say goes against that.
</p>

<p>
	The point is to make yourself so attractive that she is begging to have sex with you.
</p>

<p>
	BUT, this does not mean you don't lead her proactively into it. Leading is still very important.

<p>
	You're not going to logically persuade a girl to have sex with you anyways.
</p>

<p>
	But sometimes she can be hesitant. You gotta make her comfortable.
</p>

<p>
	Lead, lead, lead. Then if she says No, you of course back off.
</p>

<p>
	Most weak guys give up way too soon. So for such guys it is good advice to burn every set to the ground. Make her tell you NO! Push it to see what you can get away with. This does not mean forcing yourself on her, but be persistent. This is not really necessary in normal dating situations, but if you are hitting the bars and clubs and doing cold approach and SNLs, then you gotta get good at dealing with all the BS obstacles and logistics. If you are doing casual dating from your social circle then such things are not necessary. But in a place like Vegas you gotta burn every set to the ground and push the envelope.

You need to find the substances which align with your brain and metabolism.
</p>

<p>
	Some nausea on 5-MeO-DMT is normal. Sometimes the nausea can be quite strong.
</p>

<p>
	20mg is not that much plugged. You could certainly go up to 30mg and higher. 20mg vs 30mg is a HUGE difference in potency.
</p>

<p>
	If that doesn't work then look for other substances which sit better with you.
</p>

<p>
	There is no guarantee that 5-MeO-DMT will produce deep mystical experiences for you. For some people it just won't work.
</p>

	You should buy a miligram scale, since without that you don't really know what dose you're taking and you could be under-dosing.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Vaping is always more potent than plugging. So watch out. Lower your dose and go very slow. Don't take big hits.
</p>

<p>
	Some people tend to be immune or tolerant to plugging. In which case you should see a big bump in potency from vaping. So be careful. It's easy to over-vape.
</p>

<p>
	If 5-MeO-DMT works properly on you, you should be having the most profound mystical experiences imaginable. If you are not having that, you're clearly tolerant to it for whatever reason. The mystical experiences should be so deep that they make your eyes bulge out of your head.

</p>

<p>
	The harsh truth you don't want to accept is that you're needy. Which is why this whole thing bothers you. And she probably smelled it off you and ran away.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that will lose you girls faster than neediness is creepiness. Girls know how to sniff out neediness the way pigs sniff out truffles. She sniffed you out for a week or two and found you lacking.
</p>

<p>
	You will keep losing girls until you bite the bullet and grow into a stronger man with some balls.

	Other people not existing has nothing to do with coping.
</p>

<p>
	It's about becoming so conscious that you become conscious that all others are imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful who you assume is deeply awake. There's a lot of shallow awakening on YT.
</p>

<p>
	If you have any emotional attachment, it's to other people being real.

			It seems however that you're saying that they are living more happily and with flow and love because of their ignorance (if I understood correctly), while I am more stuck and have resistance because I am contemplating more (?)<br />
			But it kind of goes against what you say, because if they are not so conscious then how are they living with more flow? Isn't it the case that the more conscious you are, the more loving and at flow you are?

<p>
	There is a heavy cost for awakening.
</p>

<p>
	It's high investment, high return.
</p>

<p>
	You are in that phase of this journey where your investment is high but return little.
</p>

<p>
	Consider that all the greatest things in life have high upfront investment with little immediate return.
</p>

<p>
	Which is why fools stay poor.
</p>

<p>
	The fool is one who judges a thing by its short-term returns.
</p>

<p>
	There is no question your friends are fools. The only question is you.

<p>
	Scheduled my vaccine for Tuesday.
</p>

<p>
	Maybe I can shoot a video of me getting it. We'll see.
</p>

<p>
	Pfizer version.
</p>

<p>
	Neither the Pfizer nor the Moderna vaccines contain any heavy metals.
</p>

<p>
	Don't delay, schedule yours today.
</p>

			To give a better explanation of how this mindfulness and self acceptance have helped me:<br />
			So I have always been sucked into youtube going through rabbit holes of self help (for mental masturbation, obviously), and pretty much spent my day thinking about improving, and believing I'm improving by hardly doing a thing. My mind was very very weak and I was literally not able to do almost any activity that required my input, it was just to threatening. I'm talking about even fear of playing a video game, which I still do (because it's an emerging into a new world and I might lose myself, if it makes more sense). But I have managed to play the piano a bit (it became easier for me to be present and to risk the dirty process of learning and making mistakes and becoming creative and committing).<br />
			All of this is nice and great, but it feels for me like those things are very easy and natural to many other people. And yet, I am the one working on raising my consciousness! How could it be that I'm still behind?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The reality is that you have hardly even begun to do consciousness work. You think you're doing it, but you've only dipped your toe in the water, hence you don't have much results.
</p>

<p>
	If you are going to pursue a conscious life, you have to hold yourself to very different standards than average people. You take on WAY more responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	But also: Don't forget to have fun too! Don't be too serious about life.

<p>
	What I said has nothing to do with fear. It's just common sense that when 45 mass shootings happen per month, and you hear someone firing a gun on the streets, you gotta be very proactive about it. You don't know his age, you don't know if he threw the gun away. You gotta assume he could be a mass shooter. Many of these mass shooters are like 19 years old.

<p>
	Again, the cop doesn't know there won't be a gun fight.
</p>

<p>
	In America we had 45 mass shootings in the last month. Think about that. Then think about the position cops are in.

			Leo I have something to tell
		</p>

		<p>
			I plugged 30mg today DPT hcl with no results at all! The substance couldn't dissolve in water solution that good so I heat the syringe with tap water. The syringe was closed with a needle and sealed, I saw the substance dissolving a little more but I didn't wanted to over do it, after plugging I inspect the syringe and I found white powder inside. I let this method for now,. I snorted 20mg and felt almost nothing, I hadn't eat all day so my stomach was a bit messy also after the plugging process. So I decided to eat a toast and a slice of cheese only just to get my blood sugar up because of the discomfort and I went out with my dog as I felt better it started to kick me, it was nothing more than a warmth in my body and fingers shaking, I got a relief about what it is as a triptamine and on my way home I was thinking about it and planning one more attempt.  I snorted 40mg, my nose is perfect, no dripping no bad taste, I licked a bit of the powder and my tongue got numb, it's not happening with all triptamines, my gut would say, eating it would work pretty well on me, I got an intense body load very sensual and pleasant and was trying to explore it, it reminded me 5meo-mipt on a bit higher dose. On the trip I was contemplating how deep you described it as an experience, you are in a total higher frequencies when you trip,  I discovered that my brain doesn't use the substance completely, your brain is using the substance chemically with out a thought your brain is very efficient, this is why you don't need much of a substance and you go so deep, the substance is doing me but you do the substance.
		</p>

		<p>
			I'm afraid to use a way larger doses because I'm home alone so I need to train my brain to use the substances for efficient. 
		</p>

		<p>
			The dpt has huge potential for contemplation like the 4ho-mipt when the body load goes away  but I want to have a solid trip with 5meo-dmt first to take my fear away to go higher on dpt. I got hcl and want to try plugged
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	40mg for DPT, plugged, for an average person is too low of a dose. You won't feel much.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind that I am 2x to 3x more sensitive than normal folk when it comes to psychedelics. So a 40mg trip for me is like an 80-120mg trip for normies.
</p>

<p>
	DPT is not like 5-MeO-DMT or 4-AcO-DMT or 4-HO-DMT. It requires a much larger dose.
</p>

<p>
	It is not obvious to a cop in the middle of the night that he put his hands up vs was turning around to aim his gun.
</p>

<p>
	If the kid throws the gun aside 3 seconds earlier the cop doesn't know that.

	I'm sorry but this kid was running with a handgun.
</p>

<p>
	The media is going hogwild with these stories and framing them in a skewed way.
</p>

<p>
	This kid had a gun in his hands in the middle of the night 1 second before he was shot. After shots were fired in the neighborhood.
</p>

<p>
	He wasn't shot for no reason.

<p>
	If you are an ectomorph, of course.
</p>

<p>
	If you eat a whole foods based diet it's hard to get fat. Getting fat mostly comes from eating processed foods which are super calorie dense, nutrient dense, and addictive. Like cookies.
</p>

<p>
	Most fat people eat junk food. That's why they fat. And most of that junk food is refined carbs.

<p>
	You can get skinnier on an ice cream and bacon diet. If you eat less calories than you burn in a day.
</p>

<p>
	Eating 2500 calories of fruits per day is not so easy. And fruit carbs are way better and less calorie dense than refined carbs. If you are replacing Standard American Diet with fruits, of course you will lose weight and be healthier. You are going from more carbs to less carbs.

<p>
	Repressing sex definitely does not work. So I say indulge in it in a conscious way and exhaust your urges until you are bored with it.
</p>

<p>
	But also, sex and dating can be a giant waste of time. So be careful not to get your mind hijacked by it.
</p>

<p>
	You're damned if you do and damned if you don't. Welcome to life.
</p>

<p>
	And do not fool yourself that you will use sex to reach enlightenment or whatever.

<p>
	The point of this thread is that men are luckier than women, because it's easier for a man to raise his sexual value.
</p>

<p>
	Takes lots of work though.
</p>

<p>
	Exceptionally physically good-looking men and women alike get special treatment. This has always been the case and will always be the case. It is like being born to a millionaire family. It is a rare gift that lands in your lap. And if you get it, you will certainly use it to advance your survival.

	Again, tell this to a donkey. And see how much difference it makes.
</p>

<p>
	You are overlooking the obvious. And who gives a damn if it gives you hippie feelings or not. Reality is brutal and it does not care about being fair to you.

	You didn't really ask any clear questions. So how can you expect to get clear answers? You just sort of rambled on about your life. To get quality advice you must ask quality questions.

			Because the more time goes, the more this idea gets stuck in my mind that not only I should be COMPLETELY free to be who I always felt I am, and give my biggest contribution to the world, but that I should find a way to do it on my own terms, and only then shall I find peace, or atleast a semblance of it.. waiting for the real thing.

<p>
	Yes, this is good and you should pursue that. Build your life. Build a custom life that suits you.
</p>

<p>
	If sounds like you need basic self-help work more than spiritual work. Ground yourself in real life and discipline yourself to create material results.

<p>
	No, because there are psychedelics. Which is exactly the point. You can also modify your DNA and so forth.
</p>

<p>
	And you still have that 5% techniques. Don't dismiss that. You can do a lot with 5% if you really want to.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is really a technology problem. Gurus don't ever mention this factor.

	Most species on Earth are starving every day. They will eat anything they can just to live one more day.

	Eating lots of fruits makes me disgusted. It's easier to eat a lot of meat than a lot fruit. The sweetness becomes cloying and nauseating after a while. There is nothing natural about eating an all-fruit diet. Large juicy fruits are very rare in nature. They are like rare treats you stumble upon, not a staple you gorge on for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Fruits are not even in season most of the time.
</p>

<p>
	Go out into the wilderness and see how many fruits you can find and how long you can survive on them. And WTF are you gonna do in the winter?

<p>
	I'm telling you, the vast majority of spirituality is genetic. Doubt me if you want, but it is what it is.
</p>

<p>
	It's the elephant in the room no teacher dare speak. Yet the facts bear it out. It's not for lack of techniques that creatures lack God-realization. If you are born an ant, you're fucked.
</p>

<p>
	Simple and obvious really. You just don't want to accept it. And none of your rationales or excuses will change this.
</p>

<p>
	But hey, I will not try to debate it or prove it to you. Find out for yourselves.

	Spirituality is like 95% genetics and 5% techniques. Gurus don't tell you this cause it's bad for business.

<p>
	If you doubt this, take a look at a donkey. How many spiritual donkeys do you know? It ain't for lack of technique.

They do not have a normie brian or neurochemistry. Which is why they rose to the level of a teacher. They are worldclass people.
</p>

<p>
	There is a good reason why less than 0.0001% of the planet is awake. Most folk simply lack the hardware to do it. Psychedelics help bridge that gap.
</p>

<p>
	Some people are basically born mystics and enlightened. Some do zero work to get it. It's like being born with a huge cock. Yeah, a guy born with a footlong cock doesn't need any pills. But is that you?

			In theory, yes. Yet not always easy to do.
		</p>

		<p>
			I've been in parts of Central and South American in which a white tourist could not fully trust corrupted police. A police encounter had a significant chance of me getting abused. Intellectually, I knew I had better odds complying, yet there were a couple situations in which fleeing was on the table. It was extremely difficult to keep my composure and interact with the officer. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, it's not just abuse at the point of arrest. It is the whole legal process of the justice and prison system. There were places in which complying with an arrest had a risk of being screwed over at the police station, courts and jail. My desire to flee was most strongly fueled by what could happen <em>after </em>complying with the arrest. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Being black in some areas means that there is a risk of getting screwed over after the arrest. If the justice system was fair to black people, there would be far less people resisting arrest. As a middle-income, educated white person, I have very low risk complying with police since I know I will be treated fairly through the process.

<p>
	You make some valid points.
</p>

<p>
	But still, resisting arrest is dangerous and will always be.
</p>

<p>
	If I resist arrest in a rich white neighborhood in the manner this guy did, I still expect to get tasered and roughed up at the least.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, there is systemic racism and police abuse. But there is also stupid action by lawbreakers. Again, these are not mutually exclusive. Criminals tend to behave in irrational and stupid ways which makes them difficult to handle.

<title>Why doesn't the James Bond approach work?</title>

<p>
	Yes, being chill, nonreactive, detached, and masculine is all good and important. But while doing those things you must actively approach, and you should be more emotional, silly, and playful.
</p>

<p>
	Half James Bond, half clown.
</p>

<p>
	PLAYFULNESS is the #1 key to game. James Bond is too fucking serious.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that girls will not give you the same attention Bond gets. Because Bond is fiction. No guy gets that kind of attention automatically without being a celebrity. So you have to grab her attention and keep it captivated with effort.
</p>

			I understand that, and I personally think that he should not have resisted. But what you need to understand that him resisting was a result of a natural reaction people have to situations like this, fight or flight. Its been proven. In this situation, he knew he was going to die either way....which he did.

<p>
	Sorry, I don't buy this logic.
</p>

<p>
	Running from/fighting with cops is a very bad idea no matter what color you are, but especially if you black. It's dangerous all around. And even if you are black the statistical chances of you being killed by a cop while arrested is like 1 per million if you don't try to flee. So fleeing is just the dumbest possible idea. It shouldn't get you killed, but that is legit a risk.

			That's the problem. And also her using a gun instead of a taser is not her simply being "sloppy", its her not doing her job correctly. The whole point of police training is to be able to handle situations like this, and if you can't be work under situational pressure, then you should not even be a cop. If a firetruck driver accidentally ran over a civilian, him being "sloppy" isn't an excuse.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Being sloppy is not an excuse, it is what happened. People make mistakes. I'm sure she feels like shit about it. And she will still be tried for manslaughter. It is manslaughter but I would not hold her morally guilty for murder because she obviously made a simple mistake, which all of us are capable of on the job.
</p>

<p>
	She worked under pressure for years. And today she made 1 simple mistake, which will be the worst mistake of her life. I'm sure she will regret it for the rest of her life. It's tragic on both sides. But that's life. If she gets a sentence I prose it should be very light.

<p>
	I don't know. Nobody knows. There is no algorithm for it. It's not something the ego can control.
</p>

<p>
	Generally speaking paranormal abilities cannot be quantified or treated in a materialistic fashion. Which means you cannot say "it takes X hours of meditation to develop telekensis". It does not work like that. It's much more complex and blurry than that. That's why it's called mysticism and the occult. It is not quantifiable.

<p>
	Find out and come back and tell us.

<p>
	You are treating this topic as though we have all the answers when in fact we have almost none of the answers. To answer your questions would require 1000 years of serious scientific research.

<p>
	Mankind does not know how paranormal abilities work. We are not there yet. We hardly know which food causes cancer and you are asking about crazy paranormal stuff.
