Changing the brain is changing consciousness.

<title>Isn't nonduality just another paradigm?</title>

<p>
	No!
</p>

<p>
	That's the kicker!
</p>

<p>
	Nonduality is not a paradigm. If it were, it would be duality, not nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	You are making the mistake of confusing the map for the territory.
</p>

<p>
	Just consider: for there to be a paradigm at all, there must exist something prior to the paradigm -- the substrate so to speak -- which itself is not a paradigm. That substrate must be inaccessible via thoughts because thoughts themselves are a 2nd order phenomena of the substrate.
</p>

<p>
	Paradigms only occur at the level of thought. A paradigm IS a collection of thoughts. No thought, no paradigms. You can stop thinking an reality will still continue. But all paradigms will be destroyed.
</p>

Truth is not a matter of probability.
</p>

<p>
	Nor is the issue of evidence relevant because God is prior to the epistemic possibility of evidence or even human perception.
</p>

<p>
	I understand your skepticism. It feels justified and "scientific", but when it comes to consciousness of the ultimate origin of existence, it just won't cut it. Skepticism is a fear-based reaction of the ego-mind.
</p>

<p>
	The irony is that atheists hold the belief that atheism is not a belief. But if you introspect, you can become conscious that it is a belief.

</p>

<p>
	Both are misguided beliefs. Both are closedminded beyond help in most cases. Both are egotistical.
</p>

<p>
	Atheism NOT a lack of belief. It is just a negative belief. The belief is obviously there if the atheist just bothers to introspect self-honestly.
</p>

<p>
	Atheists believe that God is absurd, irrational, impossible, imaginary, and unscientific. An opiate of the masses.

<p>
	I didn't say JP is Hitler. I used those extreme examples to illustrate that merely having a life purpose is not automatically a good thing. The details matter.
</p>

<p>
	Passion and intelligence are a double-edged sword. You can be smart, passionate, and wrong or pathological.
</p>

<p>
	When intelligent or passionate people are wrong, they tend to get really stuck in it.
</p>

<p>
	JP has some good teachings, just be mindful that they are a Trojan horse for stage Blue/Orange conservative political ideology. Which is what made him so popular. Without the Trojan horse you would not know who he is.
</p>

<p>
	Sam Harris is too famous to really seek deeply. Same with JP.
</p>

<p>
	If Sam Harris ever came back from a retreat and told his cult-like rationalist followers that God is actually real, they would turn on him like a pack of hyenas.
</p>

<p>
	Sam's whole market base is stage Orange atheists who want validation of their atheism and rationalism.

I'm not sure what the causes of that were for you. It could of have been egoic resistance to living up to your full potential, or it could have just been that it wasn't your true passion.
</p>

<p>
	There are various solutions. Personal development and spiritual inner work is usually the answer for dissolving egoic resistances.
</p>

<p>
	I still have resistance to following my life purpose after 5 years. It's not easy to be at the cutting edge of your potential. Sometimes you just gotta act despite the fear and excuses.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you shouldn't physically overwork yourself. Try not to work more than 40-60 hours per week, otherwise it becomes unsustainable.
</p>

Finite resources still must be distributed in some way.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot escape the game of survival unless you are physically dead.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment alone does not resolve the finite resource distribution problem. Better systems must be invented for that and they will never be perfect enough to give everyone the resources they need to survive. So fighting will always take place if you care about living. If you don't care about living, then you have the option to physically die without putting up a fight.

Therein lies the whole trick of God. You cannot communicate it. Absolute Truth is outside the realm of proof, reason, thought, or speech. So talking about it is pointless. The problem is that someone like Matt Dillahunty does not understand why Truth must be incommunicable. Absolute Truth is non-symbolic.
</p>

<p>
	Atheism is like a religion. You cannot reason with it because its premises are not grounded in reason but in faith. Of course the irony is that all atheists will vehemently deny it. Which is why they cannot be reasoned with.
</p>

<p>
	The only way Matt will realize he is wrong is by going through the radical existential crisis called enlightenment. But of course his whole game is to avoid enlightenment. Which is why he's an atheist to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	See how sneaky the mind is?
</p>

<p>
	The Truth cannot penetrate a recalcitrant mind.

	To an almost total extent. Nearly 100%

<p>
	As psychedelics clearly demonstrate.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with neurofeedback is that it's too expensive and complex for most people.

<p>
	Psychedelics are the better option money-wise. And they are also more powerful.

<p>
	That's what relative means.
</p>

<p>
	You are judging the relative from the Absolute. Which isn't relative, but Absolute. Which is actually relative because the Absolute doesn't judge anything or limit anything, including the relative.
</p>

<p>
	To not make room for the relative truth will lead to all sorts of foolishness, so watch out.
</p>

<p>
	When the cop stops you for speeding, you will not be able to get away by saying, "But in the Absolute sense there is no right and wrong." In the relative domain, might makes right. Survival rules the day. You can choose to disregard the relative domain, but you will not survive long, so before you make that choice, make sure you're okay with death.

That's all just a game.
</p>

<p>
	Mostly I just care about putting forth my ideas. I've got enough ideas to share for years to come. Doing collabs just tends to dilute my work because I find few popular figures thinking at the integral level I like thinking at.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that the most popular public intellectuals are rather crude, un-integral, closedminded, and ideological in their approach. Which is precisely why they became popular. And precisely why I don't want to have much to do with them.
</p>

<p>
	A discussion with Joe Rogan would be one exception. He and I could have a deep discussion.
</p>

<p>
	The kind of stuff I like to talk about is never ever going to go mainstream.

</p>

<p>
	There are tons of lunatics in society with a firm sense of life purpose. Doesn't make it a conscious or good thing. There can be healthy life purpose and pathological life purpose.
</p>

<p>
	JP can believe whatever he wants, but the problem is that his ideology is radicalizing people and misinforming them about post-modernism and stage Green. This is actually a big problem, as you can see just by reading the YT comments that JP fans make. Their understanding of these issues is extremely polarized, unsophisticated, egocentric, and naive.
</p>

<p>
	Part of the problem is that these are young directionless males, age 18-26 who are still very immature, naive, and lacking in compassion.
</p>

<p>
	You realize, right, that in the Middle East, terrorist groups recruit members using the exact same techniques JP is using? They target exactly the same age-range of males, and they radicalize them using cultural and identity issues, by demonizing stage Orange American decadence and liberalism. "How dare those liberal Americans let women drive, get a divorce, and walk around with their tits hanging out! What chaos! They are destroying the hierarchy of Allah! Letting gays have sex without killing them is ridiculous!"
</p>

<p>
	If JP was born in the Middle East, he would be railing against stage Orange Western secular capitalism and trying to build a theocracy.
</p>

<p>
	This has nothing to do with JP per se. It's just a Spiral mind virus. Minds work in predictable ways (to those who make a careful study of the workings of the mind).

<p>
	He is not interested in reforming himself. He's out to promote his ideology. So a discussion is useless.

<p>
	Ego is the idea that you were born.

<p>
	Ego is not a brain part. Ego is a thought. The thought that you are an individual who was born and is looking around at the world, and that it is important that you not die.

</p>

<p>
	You are conflating absolute and relative domains.
</p>

<p>
	The wage slavery video was not a nondual teaching. Be careful trying to push everything through the nondual strainer. This is the problem with too much Neo-Avaita style teachings. You turn understanding of reality into an over-simplified nondual flatland.
</p>

<p>
	Many of my videos put forth RELATIVE truths, not absolute ones.
</p>

<p>
	And of course there is no literal pyramid out in the world. This was a metaphor, a map. Obviously you shouldn't go out in the world looking for an actual pyramid. You will never find it. Just like you will never find "gravity" or "the United States Of America" or "cats" out in the world.
</p>

<p>
	See my recent blog video about All Understanding Is Metaphoric. You're still falling into the trap of literalism.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing I say is ever literally true. It's a pointer or a filter through which to look at the world in a useful way.

<title>I Think I've Discovered an Insight About So-Called Relativistic People</title>

<p>
	Lol, of course ego-mind cannot be relativistic proper. Its job is to be self-biased. Survival, survival, survival.
</p>

<p>
	Relativism can only be actualized through deep awakening and dissolution of the ego.
</p>

<p>
	Then it is possible.
</p>

<p>
	That's how a Buddhist monk can set himself one fire.
</p>

<p>
	The fact is that everything is relative. But to accept this fully is tentamount to death. And only the wisest of human beings will surrender to this brutal truth.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Green post-modernists are not truly relativistic. They are phoney relativists. They have not actualized ontological relativism. They have turned relativism into a religion.
</p>

<p>
	Why is relativism so denied? Precisely because it is true. The ego cannot handle it.
</p>

	Musk is definitely beyond pure Orange. He's got a lot of Green in him. He's clearly got a great environmental consciousness and concern for mankind and values love. This is not common in pure Orange people.
</p>

<p>
	Musk is a good example of a Greenish CEO.
</p>

<p>
	It's a bit hard to tell how much Yellow he has. Not enough info in the video to tell.

	But there is still probably more.
</p>

<p>
	Do you have abiding nondual awareness? Or was it just a peak state that has since passed?
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious of what you are?
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious of what other people are?
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious of why reality is?
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious of what God is?
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious of Infinity?
</p>

<p>
	Are you conscious of what death is?
</p>

<p>
	Have all metaphysical questions been answered in your mind?

<p>
	This is fear.
</p>

<p>
	You wanna figure out what you are using this business/success to compensate for.
</p>

<p>
	What would happen if you lost your biz and never had success again in your life? What would be so wrong with that?
</p>

<p>
	Contemplate and try to face this fear. Realize it is something your ego is constructing as part of your survival agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Why do you feel so insecure? What deeper truths are you avoiding with all this success-striving?
</p>

</p>

<p>
	In fact, your passion is no accident. It is there precisely so that you don't feel the need to pick up a book.
</p>

<p>
	I am not going to explain feminism or post-modernism to you on a forum because these are nuanced topics which entire books have been written about and which require years of study to understand properly. These are not conversations for online keyboard jockeys. These are serious intellectual pursuits.

<p>
	Of course, because you are just reacting to it from ego identity.
</p>

<p>
	That's your problem right there. It would be wise to actually do some reading and research before talking about feminism.
</p>

<p>
	I would bet that 98% of JP fan have not read a single feminist work. That is the whole appeal of JP: he offers and ideology with which to demonize and attack others without doing an serious research into their POV and why post-modernism arose in the first place.
</p>

<p>
	This whole JP fandom is rooted in lack of education.
</p>

<p>
	You must learn to take on other points of view, not just insist on your own being right. All POVs are partial and relative.
</p>

<p>
	That is the lesson of post-modernism which is being missed by JP fans. They do not give a rats ass about seriously exploring other POVs. Which requires reading and research.

He is definitely much more nuanced than a solid Blue person. Solid Blue is like Mike Pence or Jerry Falwell.

<p>
	Peterson is not a religious fundamentalist.

<p>
	He is very Orange with stripes of Blue and some hints of Yellow, and a big inflammed Green shadow.

<p>
	Yellow is generally in favor of more social engineering, not less. Yellow just wants to do it in an integral, Spiral conscious way, using a systems theory approach.
</p>

<p>
	All stages basically want to socially engineer society to fit their values. Yellow wants to socially engineer society to accomodate the entire Spiral, recognizing the value each stage offers and the need to help people grow through all stages up to Yellow.
</p>

<p>
	Don Beck and his work trying to teach Spiral Dynamics to Israelis and Palestinians is the epitome of stage Yellow social engineering efforts. It's really eye opening to read about.
</p>

<p>
	My work to integrate science, spirituality, and Western philosophy is also very Yellow.

<title>divine attributes of absolute infinity</title>

<p>
	A) God wants EVERYTHING! That's what infinity is: EVERYTHING! God includes all possible dualities, including good vs bad, open vs closed minded, love vs hate, order vs chaos, peace vs violence, etc. God necessarily incorporates all of it. That is God's Love with a capital L. Nothing is denied.
</p>

<p>
	B) I give a list of names for God from all mystical traditions in the video: Mystical Traditions Around The World.
</p>

<p>
	There are like over 100 names for God outside Islam.
</p>

<title>Those Who Are Into Public Speaking....</title>

<p>
	Speaking from a script is a totally different skillset from speaking off the cuff.
</p>

<p>
	Which skillset do you want? Practice that one.
</p>

<p>
	As a middle way you could practice speaking based off a PowerPoint outline, that way you have some basic notes, but not entire written out sentences.
</p>

<p>
	Speaking off the cuff is far more enjoyable and powerful. It is the harder skill to develop, but really worth it.
</p>

<p>
	There are some people who are beyond help. Trump, Sam Harris, Scott Adams, and JP are 4 of them.

</p>

<p>
	The LP must come AUTHENTICALLY from you, not from copying stuff I say because it's just the shit that's at the top of your mind because your mind is filled with my videos.
</p>

<p>
	Double-check that you are not just aping me. Have the courage to find what is authentically within you (which I did not put there).

	Lol
</p>

<p>
	I don't think you understand what that word means.
</p>

<p>
	Do some feminists go overboard? Sure. Jailing people without a trial is wrong and should be resisted. But this does not make feminists Red or psychopaths. It's just a political position you disagree with.

<p>
	A Red psychopath is Woody Harrelson in Natural Born Killers.

Peterson criticizes Green from below.
</p>

<p>
	It's very important to distinguish where the criticism is coming from and what the proposed solutions are.
</p>

<p>
	It's possible to criticize Trump, for example, for not being conservative enough -- the way a Nazi might criticize him. That does not make the Nazi a good guy to listen to.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I don't find Wilber an astute political analyst. At this point in time the moderate right wing is a far greater threat than any potential radical left. What goes on in universities should not be compared to what is going on at the national level. There are no serious radical leftist voices in mainstream politics at all. You do not see socialism being seriously discussed in mainstream American politics AT ALL. No one is talking about elimination of private property.
</p>

<p>
	When you start seeing serious political pundits on CNN advocating for abolition of private property, THEN you might have a point to worry about some sort of radical leftism movement. Until then, it's a tempest in a teapot.

Nothing is a simulation or even an experience of anything. You have 100% direct access to Absolute Truth at all times. Everything you see is directly the Absolute Truth. But simply by virtue of your belief that you are a seperate self, you are missing this most obvious think.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing is hidden.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you aren't understanding it is because for you to understand it you would have to realize, "Oh fuck! There is no me!!!"
</p>

<p>
	And you are not yet prepared to that. Because you are only considering solutions which assume that you were born. Except you were never born. Your birth is just a story.
</p>

<p>
	If there is no you, there is no one who is perceiving experience. Which means experience isn't really experience, but Absolute Truth.

<p>
	There is no such thing as an "online library". That is called copyright infringement.

<p>
	By buying books, you support the authors who wrote them.

<p>
	Also, it does not take hours of focus to sit down with a journal and think through what you believe you are. Could take 15 minutes for you to figure out that you don't actually believe you are a body.

<p>
	That won't be the end of the journey. But at least you can realize that you don't actually know what you are.

	It's a useful model when used properly, within limits. Once you start debating if someone is 755 or 756, you've stumbled in your own stupidity.
</p>

<p>
	What you should be more concerned with are the general differences between the 600 range, 700 range, 800 range, 900 range, and so on.

</p>

<p>
	In those 2 hours he never once said what God is. Because he does not know.
</p>

<p>
	I can tell you what God is in two words: Absolute Infinity

</p>

<p>
	So what of it? He got a tiny glimpse but not deep enough to understand what it really was.
</p>

<p>
	Stage Blue people commonly have mystical experiences which they misinterpret in a dualistic, ethnocentric manner. Plenty of Evangelicals see Jesus.
</p>

<p>
	The fact that it takes JP 20 minutes to mumble his way through a conversation about God clears shows he does not know what God is.
</p>

<p>
	JP's intuition is right: God is real. But God is not anything JP thinks it is. God is total nihilism. Zero.
</p>

<p>
	The tragedy of JP's situation is that his entire philosophy is denying him access to God.
</p>

<p>
	If you follow JP, you will almost certainly never find God.
</p>

<p>
	I do so strategically.
</p>

<p>
	Spirituality is the facing of one's own death. To not say that is simply to lie about what spirituality is.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way to do genuine spirituality without facing one's death.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously don't physically harm the body.

<p>
	Goodness is pure being. The being that remains after death of the self.
</p>

<p>
	Think about it, once you're dead, how can anything be bad when bad is always relative to ego? Badness becomes impossible without an ego. After death, nothing can hurt you. You become immortal.
</p>

<p>
	There is reason for Truth. Truth is just the only thing that is. If you want to live wrapped in lies you're free to do so.

<p>
	Human development tends to be very lopsided.
</p>

<p>
	You can have an enlightened person with poor social skills and who is a horny dog who molests his students. Or he could be a sociopath who starts a cult.
</p>

<p>
	You could have an enlightened person who thinks all religons except Christianity are wrong.

<p>
	Actually mostly the opposite.
</p>

<p>
	The percentage of the population who are at a stage of development where they can pursue enlightenment is extremely low.
</p>

<p>
	Most people will require 10-20 years of ordinary personal dev work before they can seriously pursue enlightenment. Because they are not ripe for it.
</p>

<p>
	I am not a strict enlightenment teacher, and Actualized.org's goals go way beyond what people like Tolle or Mooji or Ramana taught.
</p>

<p>
	We have a much broader scope here, attempting to understand all dimensions of life: sexual, political, social, emotional, physical, philosophical, scientific, astral, religious, linguistic, motivational, business, leadership, ecology, art, etc.
</p>

<p>
	We do not stop or start with nonduality.

<p>
	Do not confuse enlightenment for development.

<p>
	You can be enlightened but still at a crude, ethnocentric level of development, or at a crude level of moral, emotional, sexual, or political developement.

<p>
	By that logic we should not teach children math, or train dogs not to piss indoors, or teach anyone nonduality.

<p>
	If their karma is right, all of those things will happen spontaneously.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Be careful how you apply your absolute insights in the relative domain. Or such absurdities as above will result.
</p>

<p>
	To teach nonduality without shadow work is downright irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
	Every serious spiritual tradition has strong injunctions against Zen devilry. Making a better world is part of the package, not optional.

<p>
	Shadow work is central to spiritual work. Without it, you will become a Zen devil.

Is this meant as a practical tool to bring about self-recognition?

<p>
	No, it is for understanding and predicting people's behaviors.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I know the Amazing Atheist will deny enlightenment so that's useful for me to know. Saves me lots of time.
</p>

<p>
	I know Trump will be a terrible Red President so I don't vote for him.
</p>

<p>
	I know Jordan Peterson is just reacting against Green so I don't get tricked by his sophistry.
</p>

<p>
	I can identify teachers who are Turquoise who I can learn lots from.
</p>

<p>
	Etc.
</p>

Their base may revolt and who knows if Owen will be willing to accept that.
</p>

<p>
	I have heard RSD instructors refer to the RSD inner circle as "North Korea". So I would not hold my breath.
</p>

<p>
	Before I started Actualized back in 2013 I approached Owen to maybe work together, but I saw that he was just not willing to grow beyond the sex and pickup as fast as I wanted so I decided to do my own thing. My vision was RSD minus the pussy chasing and materialism. Actualized.org is what I wished RSD was but wasn't. So I created it.

<title>Mooji: Don't Try Love Everybody</title>

<p>
	Ego isn't capable of true love.
</p>

<p>
	The way to love everyone is to eliminate the ego.
</p>

<p>
	So love is just the side-effect of the work.
</p>

<p>
	This is why religious people are never capable of true love. They always hate somebody because the ego hasn't been dissolved. They are trying to love as an ego. Which is just like trying to be enlightened as an ego.
</p>

<title>Reiki Masters stigma against psychedelics</title>

<p>
	How does this Reiki Master explain the hundreds of people on this forum and tens of thousands of people around the world and in clinical studies who report enormous benefits from psychedelics?
</p>

<p>
	If I had to choose between a bag of 5-MeO and the Reiki Master, I would take the bag without a second thought.
