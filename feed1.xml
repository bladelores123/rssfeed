<p>
	The businessmen who run the Western world are Care Bears by comparison.
</p>

<p>
	You are making a gross false equivalence between stage Red and Orange business.

He is no Jesus i agree but the US severely manipulates media to project false information about him because he is a powerful threat to the US core-rupted system. US have just as much if not more mafia/illuminati controlled corruption than Russia. I was into this stuff many years ago, i studied quite a lot on what happens "behind the scenes" but i haven't kept up to date as much because its quite toxic to focus on long term. Although, many things may have changed in a positive direction in the US, i still notice quite a handful of old core patterns that linger around behind the scenes.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is a quote from Putin i read a while back that made me start resorting to alternative media about him because these words were on pair with my own thinking and information i had collected over time when i was into this stuff and most of the information of the corrupted systems were released by people within the US themselves. Its usually the places that are most corrupt that more and more order and righteousness emerges from the chaos because where there is/was more suffering, is usually the ones/places who awaken first.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now here is that quote
		</p>

		<p>
			"We as a species have the choice to continue to develop our bodies and brains in a healthy upward trajectory, or we can follow the Western example of recent decades and intentionally poison our population with genetically altered food, pharmaceuticals, vaccinations, and fast food that should be classified as a dangerous addictive drug." - Vladamir Putin
		</p>

		<p>
			Anyone else would of been assassinated for this. I have observed many assassinations in relation to the words used above.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Putin is an authoritarian who kills and jails opposition leaders and journalists.
</p>

<p>
	You do not understand Putin or how Russia works. I was born there, I know how it works.
</p>

<p>
	He is the leader of the KGB. He is sneaky enough to convince you to rape your own mother. Do not buy his bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	If you oppose him, he will have your kids teeth pulled put with rusty piles in fromt of your wife. That is how business is done in Russian. They do not mess around and they are sneaky like you wouldn't believe.

<p>
	Science's empirical observations are actually what make it useful and good. Where it goes wrong is in its interpretations of those experiences and especially in its big picture understanding of what it all means.
</p>

<p>
	Science is much more than raw data collection. Raw data collection is fine. But science goes on to make models and theories, all of which are extremely limited. Data collection is also highly biased by one's survival agenda and metapnysical paradigm. You literally cannot see data which your paradigm tells you cannot exist.
</p>

<p>
	Just because a thing is limited doesn't mean it is flat out wrong. It can still be useful. But at the same time it's also missing a lot of the big picture.
</p>

<p>
	See my video: Understanding Recontextualization, where I address this point in detail.

<p>
	Human "mistakes" are the result of the freedom God gave you. You are free to make mistakes so that you could learn and grow. Otherwise life wouldn't have any stakes.
</p>

<p>
	If your life was perfect, it would be imperfect.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine a video game where you push the button once and the game excutes itself flawlessly to victory. That would be the worst video game ever. You are missing the whole point of the game.

<p>
	God does not make mistakes.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is just too small to appreciate the Grand Design. You keep underestimating God's power.
</p>

<p>
	If God is infinite that also entails that it is finite, otherwise it wouldn't be infinite. That is the paradox of God. God is too all-encompassing and all-inclusive to exclude stupidity.
</p>

<p>
	Everything you hate and dislike, God loves! Including evil, stupidity, and limitation.
</p>

<p>
	You have to really appreciate what Infinite Love entails.

<p>
	That's a self-defeating statement. The official paradigm is materialism, which denies the paranormal.
</p>

<p>
	There are millions of cases of paranormal phenomena, but they are all denied by closed minds.
</p>

<p>
	Science itself has statistically validated paranormal phenomena, but mainstream science and culture is in denial about it. Because according to official dogma, it cannot exist. Therefore it does not exist.
</p>

<p>
	You might as well be in 14th century Europe saying: offically there is no evidence the Earth revolves around the sun.
</p>

<p>
	It is the job of officials to enforce the status quo, not to reveal cutting edge truths. When you expect officials to provide you with cutting edge truths, that's where you go wrong.
</p>

<p>
	Everything official is old news.
</p>

<p>
	Science works on consensus of expertise which is based on authority.
</p>

<p>
	There cannot really be science without a community of people. One guy working in his garage is not enough to produce modern science. Science needs schools, journals, universities, labs, peer review, confrences, textbooks, grants, teamwork, common languages, paradigms, government sponsorship, common units of measure, a common metaphysics, testing, credentials, certifications, etc.
</p>

<p>
	99% of all the science you know is purely concepts and beliefs. This is true even if you are a world-class scientist.
</p>

<p>
	All of this makes science very disconnected from direct experience, leaving a lot of room for error and myopia.
</p>

<p>
	Just the fact that you think science is valid, true, respectable, and good -- notice that that's purely based on blind faith and indoctrination. You believe science is respectable because you were programmed by your culture to believe that. You have never actually verified whether science is a proper method for understanding reality.
</p>

Insight is consciousness's ability to understand itself.

<p>
	A belief is not an insight.
</p>

<p>
	To understand what an insight is you'd need to have an insight about the nature of insight.

		</p>

		<p>
			What does this mean? Like can you levitate or bring out a tornado at will ?

		<p>

		</p>

		<p>
			Or are you saying that even to witness these 'miracles' one's consciousness should be raised? 
		</p>

		<p>
			Generally people don't believe in the existence of miracles like the way people believe in the existence of gravity, so commonly they are not thought to be true. Why do you think, 99% have never witnessed these miracles, hence 99% people don't believe in them?

<p>
	Siddhis are real of course.
</p>

<p>
	But that doesn't mean you get total control over reality.
</p>

<p>
	There are serious limits for obvious reasons. We cannot have devils running around creating tornados.

</p>

<p>
	As far as we know, America's voting system is pretty good.
</p>

<p>
	Be careful that you don't misuse skepticism to do more harm than good. The point is not to doubt everything under the sun but to doubt those parts which are false. Doubting truth is like shooting yourself in the foot.
</p>

<p>
	Russia does not have a great leader. They have an utterly corrupt mafia state run by a crypto dictator. You have no idea how bad things are in Russia. Any politician there who seriously goes against Putin will get assassinated or jailed.

<p>
	That's a terrible idea to put into peoples minds. We want more people voting, not less.
</p>

<p>
	American elections are often very close, meaning that every vote is significant.

<p>
	Trump won due to about 70,000 votes in key states. Bush vs Gore was even closer.

<p>
	I have already endorsed Bernie so there's not much for me to say.
</p>

<p>
	My general advice on politics is: vote for the most conscious person who stands a chance of winning.
</p>

<p>
	Bernie has the most progressive platform and is the least corrupted by corporations and lobbyists. He also has the longest track record of being progressive. Many other progressives are only skin deep.
</p>

<p>
	Telling people who to vote for is sorta pointless because people will vote no higher than their own ego will allow.

And when the interviewer said to him something like, 'Certainly equality is good in the basic ways like voting, right?' And Elliot responded by saying something that dodged answering the question directly but implied that perhaps we should 'be open minded' and consider rescinding those rights from women.

<p>
	You cannot just blindly mix DPT with that stuff, it could be very dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	You have to take it clean, without any other meds or supplements or things. Otherwise you'll never understand what is causing what.
</p>

<p>
	Don't be foolish folks. Mixing research chemicals with random things is irresponsible.
</p>

<p>
	Do not mix psychedelics with nootropics unless you specifically tested to make sure it's okay.

<p>
	God has infinite power. The more Godlike your lucidity is, the more of it you will access until you will melt into the universe. Finally, your will will be indistinguishable from physical reality.
</p>

<p>
	Right now your questions are coming from a place of personal egoic control. That will melt away long before you access even a small fraction of God's power.
</p>

<p>
	The desire to manipulate reality is itself an obstacle here. Once you reach God-like levels of consciousness you will see that you do not need to manipulate the things you thought needed manipulating. The desire to manipulate usually comes from a lack of consciousness of the perfection of reality and lack of self-acceptance. Once your self-acceptance hits infinity, little needs manipulating.

<p>
	I wouldn't put it like that.
</p>

<p>
	I'd just put it as: a more understanding, more loving communication style.
</p>

<p>
	But communication style is only a small component of demonstrating love. Communication style is a rather surface feature.

<title>Is consciousness more like focus or wisdom?</title>

It is not quite focus nor wisdom.
</p>

<p>
	Awareness would be a better term, but even that is misleading.
</p>

<p>
	The crux of this whole work is that you're not conscious of what consciousness is and that can only be remedied by doing the practices and raising your consciousness more and more until some day you have a total understanding of what it is.
</p>

<p>
	Ultimately you'll discover that it is everything.
</p>

<p>
	Until then, if you get confused, a good practice is to pull out your hand, look at it closely, and remind yourself that your hand is made out of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	It's paramount to understand that all physical objects are consciousness. This realization frees you from the stranglehold of materialism.
</p>

			I second that. It is the most confusing aspect of all this. On one hand you say everyone doesn't exist, just imaginary characters, that don't even exist when they're not in your direct visual field, and another saying people do exist and each have their own reality and a collective shared consciousness. It seems contradictory. But I'm sure will get explained as simple a strange loop, but would love a in depth explanation of this.

<p>
	And it will remain confusing as long as you belief you were born.

<p>
	You cannot understand it because ego is in the way. You think you are a biological self. No such thing exists. That self is imaginary.

			So if you (God) altered Reality like this to heal every child on the planet, and perform other miracles, would this be experienced by everyone else? Meaning, would these miracles only be in your (Leo's) own dimension/reality, as everyone in your reality is your imagination? Or is reality shared, like it seems, so you making these huge alterations to the world would be experienced by everyone? In which case you would be considered to be like a living God. 
		</p>

<p>
	Yes, by everyone. You would be altering the collective consciousness of all beings. But this is not easy to do.
</p>

<p>
	You can alter the collective consciousness of all beings because you are all beings.
</p>

<p>
	But you'd need to be so conscious that there is no more difference between you, other beings, real, or imaginary.

His morphic resonance theory where his hypothesis is that for example rats in London learns a trick and then rats in New York learns it way faster because it gets remembered in the collective of the species.

<p>
	Somewhat, but it's way more profound than that. There aren't really harmonic fields per se. Consciousness is totally direct. It imagines stuff into being. It's totally mystical. You can't map it out in a scientific or analytic way.

<p>
	Tolerance to psychedelics varies greatly between people. DPT just may not mesh well with your brain or body. Maybe you need a much larger dose. Or maybe it won't work on you at all.
</p>

<p>
	Or maybe your technique is off.
</p>

<p>
	All this requires careful investigation to figure out.
</p>

<p>
	It's worth figuring out.

<p>
	No, no, no!
</p>

<p>
	It's not the DPT. It's what you use it for.
</p>

<p>
	You're not using it with the right intentions. It can only give you as much as you desire of it.
</p>

<p>
	Your desire must be Cosmic Understanding. Forget the music, you must want to UNDERSTAND yourself. ALL. OF. YOURSELF!
</p>

<p>
	Your curiosity must run so deep that you will not stop until you have God's total omniscience and all of the universe accounted for. Seek to understanding EVERYTHING! Cause you can. God can know itself totally, from the smallest to the biggest.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging it is paramount, so you have the time necessary to contemplate. 50-70mg is when it starts to get really amazing for me.

	I don't think you will ever succeed in making a psychedelic peak state stick. At those levels of conscious you could barely function in the world.
</p>

<p>
	Exploring Infinite Consciousness goes beyond a nondual sahaja samadhi state (as great as that is).
</p>

<p>
	A lot of people are awake, let's say, but their understanding of Infinite Consciousness is very minor. They have no idea how deeply the mechanics of God can be understood. I just don't see traditional meditation techniques or self-inquiry taking many people there. Most meditators are after Nibbana or emptiness or whatever, but there is far more to it than that. They never even realize that they are missing because they do not have a means of accessing it.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics change the game, expanding it beyond traditional awakening.
</p>

<p>
	I no longer hold Buddhism or Zen in high regard. Their methods and teachings are too weak, too crude, and too shallow.
</p>

<p>
	I released a video on my blog about DPT.
</p>

<p>
	I'll do a more formal video sometime in the future once I understand DPT better. There seems to be a lot to it that's worth exploring. It has not been explored nearly enough by people.
</p>

<p>
	At this point I like it more than 5-MeO-DMT. It is a miracle chemical.

<p>
	It's superhuman levels of consciousness which you're not likely to access without a lot of psychedelic work.
</p>

<p>
	It requires lots of person purification until you're comfortable being selfless enough to access dimensions beyond your human self. All personal psychological baggage and concerns must be jettisoned for the sake higher cosmic understanding.

<p>
	No, it's not that.
</p>

<p>
	If you think of consciousness as a set of nested hierarchies (cells, organs, people, species, Earth, solar system, etc.) then apparently you can actually tap into, for example, collective cat consciousness. You can tap into how the entire nest is being created. So imagine tapping into all fetuses of all the human mothers who are carrying a child on Earth right now. Or whatever you can imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Creation is not just happening at the level of individual beings. Creation is happening across infinite dimensions all at once. It's hard to explain but you can become conscious of it, and you can even affect it with your Will.
</p>

<p>
	I'm starting to understand how miracles can be made.

			So the drugs could only work that way if you imagined it to be possible? If you've ascended to the above and beyond like full Buddha or Christ then someone injects you daily with fluoride, meth and other neuro toxins would it still not bring you back down to ordinary consciousness or lower if you don't believe it can? I guess that could make sense since many of us I assume have heard the story of ram das, neem karoli baba and the lsd. But it seems like you could be unenlightened that way considering the use of nootropics, a healthy diet and excercise is essential for this work. You have to cleanse the mind and body to make it easier to realize the true self is beyond mind and body. So wouldn't it work in reverse?

<p>
	To be fair, most people in the US disapprove of Trump and he did not even win the popular vote.
</p>

<p>
	He is the most unpopular President of all time. Don't forget that. His base is no more than 40%.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is below the center of gravity of most Americans. Which is why he should lose in a landslide unless the Democrats manage to do something really stupid.

<p>
	It's not so simple.

<p>
	Reality is about way more than the pleasures of people.
</p>

<p>

<p>
	Most people who do hatha yoga in the West are Orange transitioning to Green. But they still have a lot of work to do before they become solid Green.
</p>

<p>
	And their politics could easily be one stage lower simply out of political ignorance.

<p>
	My point was, the effectiveness of your training will depend a lot on your pre-existing spiritual attunement and how your brain/mind functions. Imagine doing the same amount of practice but your progress is 100x less. That is more like the reality for many peeps.
</p>

<p>
	The average person cannot climb 10 stages in 1 year. That's pipedreams.
</p>

<p>
	But of course you'll never know until you try, so don't prematurely limit yourself.

<title>Not-self (anatta) vs. depersonalization disorder</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/36811-not-self-anatta-vs-depersonalization-disorder/?do=findComment&amp;comment=456614</link>

<p>
	The key difference is that the awake person is conscious that he is God. The depersonalized person is not.
</p>

<p>
	The depersonalized person also is not conscious enough to see how he is assigning negative meaning to no-self and no-meaning.
</p>

<p>
	No-self is not what people think it is. No-self is only half the story. The other half is Cosmic Self.
</p>

<p>
	The depresonalized person is missing consciousness of the Love of God.
</p>

<p>
	You're not yet understanding what I meant by survival.
</p>

<p>
	You are thinking of survival as some biological evolutionary theory. That is not what we're talking about here. I mean something much more direct and viceral.
</p>

<p>
	To understand you must turn to your direct experience of life and observe how every micro thing you do is a function of survival.
</p>

<p>
	Don't speculate about it, observe it happening in you. It's happening every second.
</p>

<p>
	We already had too many of these debates. They lead nowhere because people all have their own opinions and personal definitions.
</p>

<p>
	You must do the practices to discover what such spiritual words mean.

<p>
	100ug of LSD

<p>
	Is great to start with. Don't go beyond 2g of mushrooms or 150ug of LSD as a newbie unless you have a high tolerance.

			But is this demonization and the rejection already happening during the trip while in the blissful stage? That sounds crazy, I can imagine it happening long afterwards it has ended.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The blissful stage doesn't always come. The blissful stage is the end result of the ego surrendering.
</p>

<p>
	If the ego refuses to surrender don't expect a blissful stage. If there is psychological baggage you must deal with, that won't be blissful, that will be taxing and challenging as you work through it. Then, on future trips you'll be primed for a blissful stage.
</p>

<p>
	Taking psychedelics to experience bliss is not the right attitude. Rather, take them with the expectation of doing emotional work, whatever work is necessary for you to get closer to Truth. The more inner work you do, the more baggage you clear out, the more likely bliss will be in the future.
</p>

<p>
	Think of psychedelics like a therapy session. Challenging stuff should come up. This is how you grow.
</p>

Glad to see some folks on this forum actually doing the practices and developing their concentration skills.
</p>

<p>
	This is how it's done folks! You need to do the practices if you want to be spiritual.
</p>

<p>
	Pick a practice and stick with it until you get good at it. Practices must be done methodologically and consciously, not mechanically to get results.

	That is good. I would recommend you do more small dose mushroom trips. They will teach you a lot. Become comfortable in the mushroom space.

			Can I ask what do you mean it can be challenging? I mean truth is truth right? For everyone and in a non dual state there shouldn't be suffering right? 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, truth is not just truth. Truth is extremely radical and has many layers and facets to it. Most egos are not ready to handle the full Truth, they will recoil, freak out, reject, deny, demonize it, etc. To handle the Truth you gotta be at a certain level of development and you need a certain degree of purification of mind.
</p>

<p>
	In practice one has to ease oneself into the Truth. Usually with spiritual work this happens gradually over years and decades. With psychedelics this whole process is short-circuited, thrusting you into the Truth within minutes or hours. With smoked 5-MeO-DMT, it's even worse, you're thrust into Buddha-levels of Truth within seconds. That's way too fast for most people. It can be overwhelming and traumatic if you're not ready.
</p>

<p>
	Not all people have the same capacity to handle Truth. For some it's a lot easier than others. A lot of this has to do with how much ego you've got, how much psychological trauma or baggage you got, and how much you desire Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Most people have a very low desire for Truth, which is why they spend some little time contemplating metaphysical questions.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Sounds like you smoked it. That will be very confusing. Plugging it is much smoother and clearer and friendlier.
</p>

<p>
	Before you smoke 5-MeO-DMT you should have a lot of experience with other psychedelics. Otherwise you're likely to freak the fuck out. Because your whole reality will be ripped away within seconds.
</p>

<p>
	Start with small doses of mushrooms, LSD, etc. Only after you've explored some of the psychedelic landscape should you attempt smoking 5-MeO. Because it will hit you very hard and very fast.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging small doses is much friendlier and gives you a lot more time to understand what is going on. Blasting yourself into hyperscape is not ideal for our work unless maybe you're already very experienced and comfortable in the psychedelic landscape.
</p>

<p>
	A gentle introduction to psychedelics is VERY IMPORTANT! Gentle is the key for beginners. Which means very small doses and non-smoking methods which come on gradually and give you plenty of time to explore, contemplate, and integrate.
</p>

<p>
	When you're learning to fly you don't just jump into a F-22 jet fighter. You start with a simple, slow, gentle, propeller plane. Learn how flying works before you start doing barrel rolls and the like.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You have only seen a few hairs of the Ox's tail and already the ego is ready to forget all about it.
</p>

<p>
	Doing 5-MeO once is not enough. The lower doses can be more challenging than higher doses since the ego is still there to resist. But with that said, the higher doses can also be very challanging if you are not ready to handle the Truth. The Truth is very radical.
</p>

<p>
	It's not the spirit saying stay away, it's the ego.
</p>

<p>
	But if you feel unready, then don't do it. Sounds like you need to mature more.
