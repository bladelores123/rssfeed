	I will soon release videos on the stages of ego development. That will be more useful for understanding how the mind develops overall, and you'll easily see it in children.

<p>
	Except it obviously isn't since your baseline cannot match a peak.
</p>

<p>
	You can deny the existence of peaks all you want, but that doesn't mean they ain't there. You are just sticking your head in the sand, creating the illusion that your baseline is high consciousness.

<p>
	There cannot be such a simple answer to this question.
</p>

<p>
	It all depends. It varies from person to person and it even varies for the same person depending on his point on the path. And they are not mutually exclusive but all synergize together.
</p>

<p>
	But if you want to talk about which method will raise consciousness the most within 30 minutes, no doubt psychedelics beat everything else.

</p>

<p>
	It's not about cars or money or appealing to hippie chicks with hippy crack. It's about about learning to become a strong, authentic man with powerful social skills and who exudes charm, humor, charisma, and presence. It's about becoming grounded and confident.
</p>

<p>
	These qualities are attractive regardless of culture or Spiral stage. You can attract a crack whore this way or a yogi saint.
</p>

<p>
	Attraction is distinction from relationship compatibility. You could attract a crack whore but not be compatible with her value set. Likewise a yogi saint.
</p>

<p>
	You need to screen girls for compatibility. Doing so will make you even more attractive.

<p>
	The issue there is that there is no clear line between protests and riots. One can easily transform into the other. So it's easy to paint anyone supporting the peaceful protestors as enabling riots.

<p>
	I consider those peaceful forms of protest, but again, they can easily devolve into bullying and other forms of mob mentality which is problematic.
</p>

<p>
	The whole point of a large mob of disgruntled people is that it becomes impossible to control or predict.

</p>

<p>
	5-MeO absolutely does NOT work well one everyone. I've seen people simply not respond to 5-MeO or DMT. Like they are immune to it. To them it is a mild or not profound experience.
</p>

<p>
	For me, a small hit of DMT is so profound that it's impossible to put into words. No amount of meditation or yoga will ever produce such levels of consciousness and understanding. It is beyond anything humanly possible or even imaginable by the mind and it goes beyond all nondual teachings into realms of science fiction.

<p>
	Jimmy Dore has that view for sure. Which is why I don't like his show.
</p>

<p>
	It's so clever it's dumb. Even Zizek has admitted that Trump winning in 2020 is not going be a net win for the radical socialists. Zizek bought the idea that Trump was necessary in 2016 in order to send a message to the establishment. But he sees now that Trump is too dangerous to risk sending such "messages". It's like playing a game of chicken.
</p>

<p>
	I think Kyle will vote for Biden after all his huffing and puffing and posturing. Krystal probably not.

	I look upon that more kindly.
</p>

<p>
	I think they are being foolish and utopian, but I get it. People like that tend to be less pragmatic or savvy about how power works.
</p>

<p>
	But to actively vote for Trump in 2020 is today's analog of re-electing Hitler. Public people who do that should have their names recorded in the history books' hall of shame.
</p>

<p>
	I can forgive a guy for voting for Trump back in 2016 as they were unaware of what Trump was capable of. But now in 2020??? Now it's just getting farcical.

<p>
	Rising's problem is that they have created a brand/identity out of being contrarian, so now almost by definition they have to do the opposite of the mainstream media, even if the mainstream media says something valid.

<p>
	Green has a more integrated and expansive self-identity. Which of course embraces the feminine aspects which were suppressed at Red, Blue, and Orange -- especially by males.
</p>

<p>
	It think in today's age men get stuck at Orange more easily while women naturally gravitate out of Orange towards Green because it aligns nicely with their feminine strength. For this reason many men resist Green because they perceive it as threatening the masculine identity they've struggled to cultivate for a decade or more. Hence the whole "soy-boy" meme and guys making fun of each other as "fags" or "that's gay".

<p>
	I wouldn't go that far. I don't think Kyle wants a Trump victory. At least I give him that benefit of the doubt.
</p>

<p>
	Now Sagaar seems like he will be voting for Trump, which to me nullifies anything coming out of his mouth. Anyone who preaches populism but then votes for Trump is a fool not to be taken seriously.
</p>

<p>
	Trump is the perfect litmus test. If someone is voting for Trump in 2020, that's how you know exactly the kind of person they are. Which how we suss out folks like Tim Pool. We know exactly the kind of guy he is.

<p>
	They are limited in that regard.
</p>

<p>
	But the peak experiences are very significant for growth.
</p>

<p>
	You have to be fair here though. Listening to Shunyamurti or attending one of his retreats is certainly not going to raise your baseline level of consciousness either.
</p>

<p>
	You can learn more from DMT than you can from listening to all the gurus on YT. So it's absurd when a YT guru claims that psychedelics are somehow illusory or a distraction because psychedelics are certainly more powerful than any words coming out of a guru's mouth.
</p>

<p>
	If you have a bag of DMT you can ditch all the gurus.

<p>
	That is the the problem with idealists and ideological puritans. They get so smug off their own moral righteousness that they lose sense of the pragmatic aspects of politics.
</p>

<p>
	The reality is that most Americans are simply not as progressive as Krystal and Kyle think they are. It would be nice if Krystal and Kyle woke up to that reality. Then they would stop smearing the more centrist Dems.
</p>

<p>
	Most voters are centrist. Which means in a democracy that centrists will win lots of elections and hold lots of power. So constantly rail against this reality is rather silly. They might as well be railing against water being wet.

<p>
	Sample bias.
</p>

<p>
	You are looking at this from your personal experience which isn't representative of the general population.
</p>

<p>
	You also associate Green with more feminine qualities.
</p>

<p>
	Women also tend to get less stuck in hyper-rationality and achievement mindset of Orange.

<p>
	Their takes are just so predictable. Every episode is just another wack at how the mainstream media is exaggerating the problem of Trump while being elitist and establishment.
</p>

<p>
	YES! Mainstream media is pro-status quo. YES! Mainstream pundits are not socialists or bleeding heart hippies. So what?? It's time to move on to deeper analysis.
</p>

<p>
	And the constantly false equivalency of Trump and establishment Dems is just absurd and plays right into his hands.
</p>

<p>
	I don't doubt that people watching Rising end up voting for Trump or not voting at all. And Krystal is responsible for that.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same problem as Jimmy Dore. They criticize Dems more than Trump just to be more "woke" than the mainstream media, the effect of which is giving Trump more votes.

<p>
	That is because historically, in such societies, a woman cannot compete with men because the game is skewed towards domination and physical conquest -- which are not a typical woman's strong-suit.
</p>

<p>
	Getting married and raising kids IS a woman's chief survival strategy in countries like Saudi Arabia and elsewhere around the developing world.

	BTW, Spiral Dynamics makes no judgments about boxing or even the "lower" stages. So just because you don't like what I said doesn't undermine SD in any way. SD stands on its own. It is not a judgmental hierarchy.

	There exist many people on this Earth who have been born with supernatural spiritual abilities which are beyond anything achievable by normal human physiology.

<p>
	To compare ourselves to such people is foolish and delusional.

<p>
	Yes, there are some people who can close their eyes and trip deeper than if they smoked DMT. There also exist people who can do incredible math calculations in their heads. But these are freaks of nature and you will never be able to match their results sober no matter how long you meditate or practice math. Because their neuro-chemistry is simply different than yours. They have natural psychedelics in their bloodstream by birth.

<p>
	The truth is that you will never reach the level of consciousness of a Sadhguru, Jesus, or Buddha. They are supernatural freaks of nature.

	Nearly everything I say is implicitly relative, I just don't bother to re-explain myself every time for every newcomer.

<p>
	Murder is only wrong in the relative. But notice, I can still discourage murder. It seems like a contradiction but it isn't. We must still act within the relative domain and play the game of life.

<p>
	High and low consciousness are not absolutes. They are relative terms used in the relative domain.

	What is being said here is more nuanced than you're making it out to be. Try to understand the communication rather than reacting blindly against it.

<p>
	Very loaded framing there.
</p>

<p>
	Most people don't like being alone. This is not a female only thing. People are social creatures and like company. Men and women are designed to need and complement each other, like two pieces of a jigsaw puzzle.
</p>

<p>
	In traditional cultures, men are also asked, "When are you getting married? Why are you still single?" That's just how how traditional cultures operate. They push for family life because they don't know any other way.

You can enjoy low consciousness things without having to justify them as high consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	If you enjoy boxing, then enjoy boxing. I'm not here to take that away from you.

<p>
	See, if you want use your rape logic, then we can also say that punching people in the face is technically assault, and only done by criminals. But it has been turned into a sport so it's legitimized. Well, the same could be done with theft or murder.

<p>
	I doubt you'll be able to avoid the fear. A central part of this work is facing fear and dealing with it in the moment. Otherwise it's like you're afraid of being afraid, which just makes you weaker.
</p>

<p>
	There's no easy way to take such powerful chemicals. If you want to avoid such fearful possibilities you should just not take psychedelics at all. They can and will freak you out if you take enough of them. The trick is to be courageous.

<p>
	By your logic anything can be considered high consciousness as long as we turn it into an art:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Rape
	</li>
	<li>
		War
	</li>
	<li>
		Torture
	</li>
	<li>
		Bank robbery
	</li>
	<li>
		Genocide
	</li>
	<li>
		Con artistry
	</li>
	<li>
		etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Just because something gives you joy and comes from passion does not make it conscious. Lots of unconscious stuff gives low conscious people joy.

<p>
	Superficially it might seem that way. But you can't compare the significance of de-cluttering your home with the significance of creating a lifestyle where your activities and the 8 hours you spend at work each day, spark joy.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a male/female thing. Even if you are female you will still gain more from what I said than reading all of Marie Kondo's books and de-cluttering 10 houses. De-cluttering is simply not gonna improve the quality of your life very much. Because there are bigger fish to fry.

<p>
	Well, feminism ain't the highest perspective on reality.
</p>

<p>
	And there are many different kinds of feminists.
</p>

<p>
	I consider myself a feminist without subscribing to the idea that femininity has no biological basis.
</p>

<p>
	Mostly what feminists want is to correct for historical oppression of women and gross excesses of patriarchy. You can be a feminist and still accept the evolutionary origin of femininity and sexual asymmetry.

<p>
	Republican candidates are just a representative sample of the Republican base. They have similar levels of cognitive and moral development. Similar levels of consciousness. All conservatives are highly conformist by nature. That's their entire MO.
</p>

<p>
	They are against progressive ideas because their minds are not open to new ideas period. They would even be against putting mayo on their french fries or eating ducks instead of chickens or wearing purple hair.

<p>
	The female mind/psyche, on average, is chemically hardwired to be more empathetic and relationship-oriented because that is necessary for healthy raising of children.
</p>

<p>
	Women are more emotionally sensitive for this reason. This is what a mother needs because this is what a newborn child needs.
</p>

<p>
	This is obvious stuff if you just contemplate it for a moment.

<p>
	That is the key feature of low cognitive development.
</p>

<p>
	A highly developed mind is too self-aware to scapegoat, blame, project, judge, or classify others as "evil". Only a low consciousness mind can do that. Which is why they seem "stupid" to you. You are just too self-aware for such things. But they are not.
</p>

<p>
	So yes, this makes them fools, relatively speaking.
</p>

<p>
	It's like dealing with children. They have the minds of children. They spin their own bullshit and then swallow it, hook, line, and sinker.
</p>

<p>
	And only such people would get attracted to Trump in the first place. A highly cognitively developed mind would see right through Trump's bullshit from day one. Trump supporters are rubes, plain and simple. They must have a similar level of development as Trump himself to like him.

<p>
	That's how cult psychology works. It's based on exploiting the weakness of those with low cognitive development, the ignorant, and the paranoid.
</p>

<p>
	People like that are at the conformist level of cognitive development, which means that they do not reason about things. They simply accept whatever their in-group believes without question.
</p>

<p>
	Given that so many Trumpists have been defending Trump for 4 years, their egos are so all-in that they cannot now admit any wrong-doing. So as Trump reveals himself to be more and more of a shameless monster his supporters will have to double-down on their denials and projections. They need a scapegoat. They need someone who to blame their ignorance on. So of course it's gonna be their arch-enemy: the globalists, elitists, socialists, Jews, minorities, Hollywood, etc.
</p>

<p>
	It's all just textbook projection and scapegoating. Everything they blame the socialists of, they are guilty of themselves.
</p>

<p>
	Just simple-minded people see the world in terms of good vs evil. So course anyone not supporting Trump is helping the evil people. And greatest evil they can imagine is pedophilia. So it turns into a perfect cocktail of ignorance and their ego eats it all up because they are developmentally incapable of self-reflection or intellectual honesty.
</p>

<title>5-MeO-DMT first experience: The ego is strong (11mg insufflated)</title>

<p>
	Good work. You just need to up your dose. Your dose is at the point where the ego still struggles to hang on. Once your dose gets to 15mg or 20mg, it will actually be easier as you enter a full nondual state. Stop worrying about the ego. It is irrelevant. Just snort it and enjoy the ride.
</p>

<p>
	At around the 20mg range you should be safe.
</p>

<p>
	Of course breathing is important. Don't stop breathing. But don't obsess over it either. You don't need to do any special deep breathing. Just normal casual breath.

</blockquote>

<p>
	The whole point of fully letting go it that you accept it even if it means death.
</p>

<p>
	You just have to get over the fact that you might never come back. That comes with the territory of tripping. There are no guarantees, nor is it a good thing to desire such guarantees because this entire process is about facing your fear of death head-on and surrendering to the inevitable.
</p>

<p>
	You are not gonna escape this life alive. So you might as well accept that now.
</p>

<p>
	20mg is a reasonable dose and I doubt anyone would die from it unless they have some special medical condition.
</p>

<p>
	Not if you are sexist.
</p>

<p>
	You see... people who are sexist or racist or anti-semitic -- their sexism and racism isn't rational. They will follow it even if it means making less money or getting worse results.
</p>

<p>
	Someone who hates Jews will not hire a Jew to do this accounting even if the Jew will save him money.
</p>

<p>
	That's the whole problem with prejudice. It is counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	If some sexist believes women are weaker than men, that's reason enough for him not to hire a woman. He's not sitting there doing a cost-benefit analysis on this prejudice.
</p>

<p>
	The wage gap is not a conscious thing, it's more of a systemic thing.

<p>
	Becoming a bear in your dreams is not the same thing as a breakthrough salvia trip.
</p>

<p>
	And shamans used psychedelics! So it's rather odd to use shamans as a case against psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming a bear is not the same level of freak out as becoming a toilet seat.
</p>

<p>
	Nobody here is gonna mediate in a cave for 40 years. So citing such examples is absurd.

<p>
	My opinion of this Rising show has been getting lower and lower. Just wanted to alert you guys who watch it to be careful as it's starting to turn into distortion and propaganda while posturing as progress.
</p>

<p>
	All these Rising hosts do is bash whatever mainstream media says, even if mainstream media makes valid points. This blind anti-mainstream, anti-"elitist" ideology is gonna become a worse cure than the disease.
</p>

<p>
	I get the sense at a lot of folks are YT will fall for this new anti-"elitist" ideology without recognizing it as ideology.
</p>

<p>
	While Sagaar is no Nazi, he's still getting trapped in ideology of a new sort. And Krystal is too.
</p>

<p>
	Hope you guys are wise enough to see through the game.

<p>
	Dude, you have no idea how a psychedelic can shake you.
</p>

<p>
	Smoke a breakthrough dose of salvia and you will turn into a glass of orange juice, and all your enlightenment will melt away along with your sense of human life.
</p>

<p>
	What most enlightened people talk about is weak-sauces states of conventional consciousness. They have no idea how deep consciousness can really go. It is not possible to know such things without serious breakthrough trips on a wide variety of substances.
</p>

<p>
	There is no way you will mediate or self-inquire your way to such radical degrees of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Most teacher even acknowledge that it's possible to become conscious as an inanimate object.

	Blind conformism.

<p>
	90% of people who vote do not seriously think about actual policy. They vote based on their gut feel, which is governed by their level of Spiral development.
</p>

<p>
	Voting is not a logical activity. It's more akin to watching porn or scratching an itch.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I explain it to myself like this:
</p>

<p>
	1) The Green value system can easily be turned into an ideology without properly building up to it. You can just get programmed by the value system via your environment without growing into it yourself through inner work. This creates a flakey veneer of Green. In this case it might be a Green ideology which is almost as though adopted by stage Blue like people.
</p>

<p>
	2) Green is a deep stage with lots to master and integrate. Most people who are "Green" aren't solid Green. They are dabblers.
</p>

<p>
	3) It's easy to talk Green and believe Green while not having a solid foundation in Blue & Orange because someone else pays your bills. To truly lock down Green requires going off on your own and building a quality life. Which will necessitate exploration and mastery of Blue and Orange. I think many college kids are missing this.
</p>

			You assume a lot. A lot of the women on this forum are older, experienced and some including myself have sons of their own. I've sacrificed hours of my own life and career to get my autistic son the social interaction and experiences he needs so he isn't handicapped that way later in life. I've thought a lot about life from other perspectives, too much about their's and not enough on my own, in fact.

	I understand your frustration, but this thread is not about helping you, it's about helping a guy. From the guy's POV, when it comes to attracting females, listening to their advice is usually counter-productive.

	Yes, but the context of this discussion is how to attract a female. If the context were reversed, I would say the converse.

You just need to realize that your relationship with anyone is already 100% unique. You don't have to try to be unique or special because you already are that. Just honor (be conscious of) the uniqueness of every moment and being.
</p>

<p>
	You can build love with ANY aspect of reality, person, or creature. There is no limit to love. The limits are self-imposed by thinking too much inside the box and by fear.

<p>
	But the whole point of being "good" is that one doesn't go for the kill.
</p>

<p>
	If Bernie was the kind of guy who went for the kill, you'd hate him as he'd just be a standard politician.
</p>

<p>
	Higher consciousness means you don't go for the kill. The cost of that is not getting elected and not having power.

<p>
	You can't ever win that game because that kind of good vs bad is dualistic and relative. So no matter how much "good" you create and how much "bad" you avoid, you will always fail.
</p>

<p>
	True Goodness is Absolute, which means it includes the "bad".
</p>

<p>
	The ultimate solution to "bad" stuff is not to avoid it, but to stop seeing it as "bad".
</p>

<p>
	"Bad" is a projection of the ego-mind thanks to its endless desire to survive. So this problem cannot be solved at the level of consciousness you're trying to solve it at.
</p>

<p>
	Absolute Good does not mean that your ego will get everything it wants.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	The common denominator is authoritarianism/totalitarianism.
</p>

<p>
	What all these "bad" governments have in common is that they overuse their power to dominate others rather than truly taking into account the needs of the many and the powerless. This bullying dynamic is guaranteed to occur at lower stages of ego development: stages Red, Blue, Orange, and even to some extent Green.
</p>

<p>
	This dynamic is just a natural consequence of selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	It takes a deeply selfless person to lead in such a way as to not exploit or bully those who are less powerful than he is. This problem is so broad that it goes way beyond applying to fascists. Fascists are just a particularly nasty and extreme example of it. But bullying can take many subtle forms too.

<p>
	This is known as the pre/trans fallacy, conflating advanced mysticism with fundamentalist religion.

<p>
	True spirituality is not a belief at all. It is direct consciousness of the Absolute.

<p>
	If you just blindly believed Leo, then yes, you would be falling into a stage Blue trap. But that is as silly as saying, "By believing your math teacher you are just being stage Blue and math is just true in your math teacher's experience and it's different for everyone so I don't need it."

	Because their perspective is biased by their survival agenda.

<p>
	A woman does not understand what is required for a guy to attract a woman. Understanding this requires lots of experience attracting women. Which women do not have. It is also not in their self-interest to understand it.
</p>

<p>
	It would be like a rabbit understanding how to hunt rabbits. This does not compute in the rabbit's mind. The rabbit cannot imagine the hunting of rabbits. The rabbit will just give you advice to preclude hunting altogether because the rabbit must be anti-hunting to survive. So there is an unconscious conflict of interest problem.

<p>
	That is dating advice.

<p>
	Women do not spend time analyzing guys who approach them.

<p>
	Generally yes, but a woman is not the right person to ask about how not to be creepy. She hasn't spent much time thinking about this from the guy's POV.

<p>
	Trump is not a fascist simply because he has no ideology. He is motivated purely by the satisfaction of his impulsive ego and winning.
</p>

<p>
	Ironically to be a fascist requires having some higher principles/ideals which would be too inconvenient for Trump's style of pure opportunism.
</p>

<p>
	But many fascist-like folks gravitate around Trump because fascists love a "strong-man" and Trump will appease them as long as they love him back. It's a toxic co-dependency.
</p>

<p>
	Steven Bannon and Stephen Miller fit the classic definition of fascism better:
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">
	<div class="ipsQuote_citation">
		Quote
	</div>

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>
			"Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete and regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties. Such a state is led by a strong leader—such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party—to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society. Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature and views political violence, war, and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation. Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky (national economic self-sufficiency) through protectionist and interventionist economic policies."

<p>
	I wasn't talking about the effects of climate change. Those are more long-term. I was talking more about the next 10-20 years.
</p>

<p>
	The effects of immigration crises due to climate change and the right-wing backlash that could cause is potentially be a big deal, but I don't see that happening yet for at least 20+ years and it's too hard to predict anything that far into the future.

<p>
	Not too much further, as it becomes self-defeating.
</p>

<p>
	I think most decent conservatives are starting to see that Trump is a disaster and he is incapable of really helping them.
</p>

<p>
	There will always be an extremist fringe, but I don't see them taking over the government. Trump was their best chance and he failed.

	Camping is much harder since you will need to plan logistics well and worry about the elements.
</p>

<p>
	Make sure you pack everything you need for survival.

	1) Don't trip when you are in a bad mood.

<p>
	2) Don't trip for the purpose of experiencing bliss or pleasure.

So it's not identical, but there are important similarities.

<p>
	Every ego's take is partial and self-biased.
</p>

<p>
	Every ego has a POV as to what's going on in the world, and all of these POV are biased and shaped by one's survival needs and level of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	There is going to be a kernel of truth even in things which Bannon or Hitler say. The real test is how they act when they get power.

<p>
	Hehehe...
</p>

<p>
	Yeah, right-wing populism has a long and rich tradition.
</p>

<p>
	Hitler's whole appeal was that he was supposedly restoring power to the ordinary working German which was stolen from him by elitist communist globalist Jews.
</p>

<p>
	Meanwhile Bannon worked for Goldman Sachs and was arrested on a $25 million yacht.
</p>

<p>
	Meanwhile Trump's tax cuts gave neo-libs and globalists billions in tax breaks while screwing the working class.
</p>

<p>
	Bannon is a neo-lib globalist in his personal business life. He just happens to have a veneer of nationalist ideology over top of that.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing new here.
</p>

<p>
	Such people have no intellectual integrity and they are nothing like Bernie or AOC.

It is whatever you imagine it to be and it will not hold for anyone other than yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But it's even worse than that. It won't even hold for true for you. You yourself will violate your own morality for the sake of survival. Because your commitment is not to anything but the preservation of your ego-mind and your identity.

	Reality is not a concept.

			In this current scenario, if the trump beats joe biden, it will be a massive defeat for corporate dems like it was in 2016. The democratic party will be in chaos. It will help the progressives to energise their base and they will be able to make the point to the people that same old centrism won't work.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	This is what some progressives said back in 2016. But it just didn't pan out. Trump was already supposed to be the punishment to centrists for Hilary. Now you say the punishment wasn't enough, now we need Trump x2. Then in 2024 you will say we need someone else like Trump for x3.
</p>

<p>
	Meanwhile, all these punishments kill tens of thousands of people and damage the instutions which hold government together. It's a dubious strategy which shows little promise.
</p>

<p>
	Majority of the country is centrist. So you will not convert them into progressives via years of electing self-destructive right-wing monsters.
</p>

<p>
	People do not appreciate that Trump is doing decades worth of institutional damage to the system via life-long judge appoitments, etc. The next 4 years will involve at least 1 supreme court appoitment which will be disasterous if Trump is in charge. For this reason alone you should be eager to vote for Biden.
</p>

<p>
	The centrism of Biden is much overblown. Biden will still enact progressive stuff over 4 years. Of course he will not up-end capitalism, but the country is not ready for that so it's a moot point. It's silly to prefer Trump over Biden because you will directly hurt progressive causes.
</p>

<p>
	Just because Biden is not giving you radical change does not mean he's bad. Moderate improvement that sticks is better than radical improvement that doesn't.
</p>

<p>
	Biden will make improvements to healthcare, environment, regulation, taxation, etc. They will be incremental. Which is how most evolution is.

<p>
	That's exactly correct.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, schizophrenic people are MORE conscious. But their consciousness is not as stable or consistent, hence they seem weird or struggle to function.

	Flask method will not work well because you won't be able to suck it out of the bottle.
</p>

<p>
	The flask needs an air hole on the bottom to work. You can't suck air out of a rigid closed-ended bottle.
</p>

<p>
	The vapor will also quickly condense on the flask's neck as it cools. Thus you will not be getting anywhere near the full dose if you don't inhale it immediately. You need to inhale it within seconds. Otherwise it will collect as crystals around the neck.
</p>

<p>
	It's simply a brutal reality.
</p>

<p>
	Non-assimilating will produce a worse outcome for them than assimilating.
</p>

<p>
	I don't mean that Europeans were not assholes for their genocidal ways. The genocide would have happened to some degree regardless due to racism and so on. But trying to preserve a primitive pre-industrial culture simply will not work. It's a losing battle.
</p>

<p>
	Every pre-industrial culture will get wiped out as society evolves to more complex ways of living.
</p>

<p>
	My only point was, if you are from such a culture, you should recognize this and get off the sinking ship.
</p>

<p>
	There is a long history of people wanting to build Utopia.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is it doesn't work in practice because people are selfish and power-hungry assholes.
</p>

<p>
	Survival runs the show, not high ideals.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to build Utopia, first you gotta genetically engineer a new race of humans who are 10x more selfless and conscious than current humans. And replace all the old humans until none are left.
</p>

<p>
	And even then, it will be iffy.

<p>
	There is relative love, the opposite of which is fear.
</p>

<p>
	And then there is Absolute Love, which has no opposite because it encompasses everything, including relative fear.
</p>

<p>
	The duality is only present when you are stuck in relative, dualistic consciousness. When you are fully awake, you only see Absolute Love with no duality.

This flow is what we ordinarily call "reality". Psychedelics disrupt this flow, thereby changing reality. But then the flow goes back to what it was. Like throwing a rock into a river.
</p>

<p>
	If your consciousness wasn't like this, you'd literally be considered insane because you wouldn't have a stable sense of "reality".
</p>

<p>
	There are people who can manifest millions of dollars in their own realities. But you call such people insane.
</p>

<p>
	If you could manifest a million dollars in your reality, everyone around you would call you insane and they'd probably lock you up or kill you for witchcraft.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	If I had to guess I'd say you didn't try those various things rigorously enough.
</p>

<p>
	This might mean you should go live normal life and burn off some karma before you are ready to restart your journey.
</p>

<p>
	If you are young, spend 5 or 10 years just building up your life and exploring life. Then come back to enlightenment.

<title>Feelings of disgust and distancing towards the physical apperance of old people.</title>

<p>
	Of course, disgust is a common emotion.
</p>

<p>
	If you really want to study this emotion, next time you take a shit, don't flush. Take your face and try to slowly stick it as close to the toilet as possible while consciously feeling and contemplating, What is disgust?
</p>

<p>
	Notice how everything in your body and mind wants to avoid it. Disgust is an avoidance survival mechanism.
</p>

<p>
	Some aspects of reality are so against your survival agenda that they are literally unacceptable and therefore avoided at all costs.
</p>

<p>
	It is a self-bias of the ego-mind which keeps it from seeing Infinite Love.
</p>

<p>
	Systemic analysis is not a conspiracy theory. The problems with capitalism are real.
</p>

<p>
	Regarding the other stuff, notice that if your reaction is fear-based, it is not healthy and not resourceful.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to fear is love.
</p>

<p>
	Notice when you are afraid and consciously reorient your mind towards love rather than fear.
</p>

<p>
	I will release a video about conspiracy theories soon.

<p>
	Now is not a good time for such things.
</p>

<p>
	It's smarter to focus for the next year on improving other parts of your life.
</p>

<p>
	Why ice skate up hill?
</p>

<p>
	You can resume dating after Covid passes.

	If you can, vote in-person to make sure your ballot counts.
</p>

<p>
	I never vote by mail for this reason. I don't want my vote to be lost in some election office back-room.

<p>
	Not quite correct.
</p>

<p>
	To be more accurate, Shaprio is half Orange himself. He's Blue/Orange. But Blue sees the cultural extremes of Orange -- especially its loose sexuality -- as Red.
</p>

<p>
	It's the same reason stage Blue Islamist denounce Western culture. They see it as too loose morally and sexually.
</p>

<p>
	A woman wearing a bikini is to an Islamist what the WAP song is to Ben Shapiro.

<p>
	Trump is gonna try to take the entire country and government down with him as he crashes and burns.
</p>

<p>
	Because his ego cannot take responsibility for the loss. So he will lash out more and more, scapegoating everyone he can, using whatever tactic he can, no matter how despicable. That's how stage Red behaves when it is cornered.
</p>

<p>
	He does not give a damn about the collateral damage as long as he can increase his odds of winning.

<p>
	Don't confuse your neediness and desperation for Love with a capital L.
</p>

<p>
	In the domain of the relative (relationships), you must seek the right fit rather than justifying a wrong fit as Love. True Love here would be not wasting her time with the wrong fit.

			How do you go about just experimenting with different women in a conscious way without "exploitation", when they are often repelled by being up front with your sexual intentions.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	That's like asking, "How do I go about hunting rabbits in a friendly way where none of them get hurt?"
</p>

<p>
	What you should contemplate is how everything you do hinges on your selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a woman's job to satisfy your sexual needs.
</p>

<p>
	If you treat women merely as objects to satisfy you sexually, then you should expect all the accompanying karma that comes with being a selfish devil.
</p>

<p>
	The proper solution to this problem is to date women and build lasting relationships, which means you have to stop thinking with your dick.
</p>

<p>
	Using people for sex is inherently unconscious, as it creates a lot of needless suffering and bad karma.
</p>

<p>
	Anyone spreading right-wing dogma or Trumpism on this forum will be banned. We don't have time for such stupidities here.

<p>
	If you wish to hold conservative views, that is okay, but you must articulate them with some intelligence and nuance, not as dogma or some reactionary FoxNews talking points.
