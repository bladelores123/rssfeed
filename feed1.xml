<p>
	Emotions are self-manipulations doing the work of survival.
</p>

<p>
	The more conscious you become, the less you will need to rely on them to live life. You can live your life more consciously instead.
</p>

<p>
	Emotions are like the strings of the puppet-master's hand controlling the puppet. Resisting feelings is just one more string. Being run by feelings is all the strings. Consciousness is seeing the entire mechanism at work from a detached meta-perspective. No string is good or bad, good and bad are themselves strings invented by the puppet-master to tighten his control over the puppet.
</p>

<p>
	Such a door exists. It's called 5-MeO-DMT.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is, most ego-minds are too terrified to walk through such a door. They cannot help themselves. Their ignorance is too deep.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to hide an amazing thing from everyone is to make it too good to be true. Then no one will bother to try it under the assumption that nothing can really be as good as that.
</p>

<p>
	Therein lies the whole tragedy of our situation. We are in heaven but we insist on creating our own hell.

</p>

<p>
	It will be too radical for you to properly integrate. You risk freaking out and abandoning psychedelics altogether from one overwhelming experience.
</p>

<p>
	Start small. Don't rush. There is no rush. The field of psychedelic is so wide and deep it will take you many years and hundreds of trips to explore it all.
</p>

<p>
	Slow and steady is better than hard and fast when it comes to transforming yourself. Hard and fast changes tend not to stick and produce lots of ego backlash and frustration.
</p>

<p>
	Do not dismiss the power of psychedelics like mushrooms or LSD. They are fantastic, magical tools. 5-MeO is just so good that it is in a class all by itself. If God existed in powdered from, it would be 5-MeO-DMT. And luckily it does exist in such a form.

<p>
	I think you should be fine. Just start with small doses and work up. Frying would only be a thing at very high doses.
</p>

<p>
	Plugging is by far the smoothest and safest method.

</p>

<p>
	I get very little body load on 5-MeO. LSD and 2-CB have much worse body load for me.
</p>

<p>
	Oh, also make sure your 5-MeO is pure. It should be white-colored. Any other coloration is impurities.

Just doing opposite things automatically sounds mechanical and not conscious. The solution is to do things more consciously.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, challenging your automatic survival reactions is good. It is harder than merely observing. It's the next step after lots of observing.
</p>

<p>
	There is no categorization per se. 99% of all the stuff you do every day are your survival mechanisms. Rather than trying to categorize them, observe them. Categorizing stuff tends to itself be a survival mechanism. Why are you categorizing stuff? To help you do what?

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	I have been meaning to. But plugging has been so incredibly effective and perfect that nothing more could be wanted. At least that's how it feels inside the trip. Outside the trip my mind can come up with all sorts of other stuff to try.
</p>

<p>
	I'm a little wary of smoking because I don't want to blow out my energetic system. Too much 5-MeO too fast does not feel healthy to me.
</p>

<p>
	But I am open to smoking it. In fact I will try Bufo soon.

<p>
	Identification and survival is an extremely complex and sophisticated mechanism. It's got may layers to it, most of which are of course subconscious.
</p>

<p>
	It's a complex tangled mess that takes not just years, but DECADES, to fully understand and deconstruct. It must be this way because your entire life hinges upon it. If it was not this complex and sophisticated you'd be dead a long time ago.
</p>

<p>
	Don't get discouraged. Keep slowly untangling that mess.
</p>

<p>
	Virtually EVERYTHING your mind and body does, from morning to night is survival. Almost not a single thought crosses your mind which is not related to your survival. You need to take this point very seriously. Really notice it. You must notice how survival dominates your entire life on a second by second basis. And all of that is tied in directly with ego and identification. They are so closely tied that you don't know the difference between yourself and your survival. Every emotional disturbance you experience is survival-in-action. EMOTIONS ARE SURVIVAL! THOUGHTS ARE SURVIVAL!
</p>

<p>
	The significance of this cannot be overstated.
</p>

<p>
	The solution to it is, you observe it. Like an owl watches a mouse. The more you observe, the freer you become of it, the less it controls you like a puppet.
</p>

	God is very big! Very, very, very BIG!
</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	If you plug it rather than smoke it, the experience will be much, much smoother and gentler.
</p>

<p>
	But it will still mindfuck you real good.
</p>

<p>
	Conquering your fear is a major part of this whole process. There cannot be deep awakening without facing your deepest fear of death. Awakening is that which lies beyond death. First you die. Then you see God. Then you laugh.
</p>

<p>
	P.S. I don't think Bufo can be plugged though. That's one of its downsides.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it like going on a big rollercoaster.

<p>
	It cannot be otherwise. Survival requires identification. The function of identification is to single out what must be survived. If you didn't have an identification you would not be able to tell yourself apart from a chair, and you would not know which of the two is more important to defend and protect.
</p>

<p>
	Your entire mind is what you identify with, and what you try to survive. Into this are tied all of your thoughts, beliefs, opinions, attitudes, behaviors, emotions, reactions, knowledge, etc. That entire tangled mess is the self/ego-mind. Its job is to survive at all costs. Which is why changing any part of yourself is so hard. All change is perceived as death and resisted with a vengeance.

<title>How does realization happen?</title>

It's not an iffy thing. It's not just that you see an amazing vision which is so beautiful it could only be the work of God. No. You literally realize: "OMG! OMG! OMG! I! AM! GOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" It's not an idea. It's not a belief. It's even an experience per se. It's actual God. You realize what the word God actually means for the first time in your life.
</p>

<p>
	God is unlimited everything.
</p>

<p>
	When you realize God, there is absolute certainty. There is no doubt whatsoever. God is impossible to doubt. The entire universe finally makes sense to you.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with 300ug of LSD is that the visuals and body load becomes so overwhelming they become a distraction from direct contemplation of What am I? What is reality? What is God?
</p>

<p>
	Although I've realized God on 125ug of LSD. But I'm very sensitiveness to psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	You want to lower your psychedelic doses so you can contemplate and stay focused. A high dose is actually counter-productive to our aims here. A wacky crazy fun trip is not the same as a productive contemplative trip.

<title>Just watch the breath guys</title>

<p>
	Watching the breath is a surprisingly powerful technique.
</p>

<p>
	But I also find that deconstruction is necessary. A lot of meditators spend years watching the breath but never awaken because that's usually not enough. The materialist paradigm and stuff like the self/other distinction is still there, operating in the background, grounding one's reality. Such anchor points must be questioned and deconstructed. It's easy to watch your breath for 10 years all the while thinking you are just a human being in a physical body separate from the world and other people.
</p>

<p>
	Watching the breath is really good once you've questioned the materialist paradigm to death. Then watching the breath can feel open and spacious, almost like a mild trip.
</p>

<p>
	Regarding the Buddha, the thing is, whatever the Buddha did 2500 years ago, today we live in a much different environment. The Buddha did not have TV, internet, porn, radio, YouTube, video games, high school, university, etc. The Buddha's mind was not filled with a bunch of materialist and scientific concepts. This made things much easier for the Buddha than for today's average person who's head is filled with thousands of concepts through school and university and culture. That stuff needs a lot of deconstructing. The success of technology makes scientific materialism seem unquestionably true and real in a way that it was not 2500 years ago. The Buddha grew up in a highly spiritual culture whereas we are in a highly materialistic and atheistic culture.
</p>

<title>Knowing god vs being existence</title>

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Buddha did not deny God. Buddha is God. He was just humble about it. Don't confuse humility with denial of the obvious.
</p>

<p>
	You must be extremely careful about the context of spiritual teachings. Everything Osho is talking about when he is denying God is actually not in contradiction to what I say. He is speaking against the stage Blue Christian version of God as a bearded man in the clouds. Yes, that God is a human invention.
</p>

<p>
	But then there is ACTUAL God, which is identical with existence.
</p>

<p>
	You must understand spiritual communications in their totality rather than just seeing words like "there is no God" and taking them at face value.
</p>

<p>
	Spiritual teachers often like to be provocative. For example, if a Christian student comes to a Zen master and asks him about God, the master will tell him there is no God, drop it. But if an atheist student comes to the same Zen master and starts telling him how there is no God, the Zen master will tell him that God is real.
</p>

<p>
	Why is it done this way? Because the dualistic mind clings to images and beliefs rather than directly experiencing the truth of things. So the #1 job of a guru is to break your mind's rigidity.
</p>

<p>
	If I was talking to a fundamentalist Christian, I would tell him there is no God. Because if tell him there is a God, he will think I am talking about his image of God, which is not God at all. He needs to drop that image. ACTUAL God is nothing like his image. It's almost the opposite of his image.
</p>

<p>
	The idea that Buddhists don't have a God is a very bad misunderstanding of Buddhism. Every seriously realized Buddhist knows what God is. They just don't use a bunch of godly language. They like to call it Emptiness. Which the unawakened person (the outsider like you) misunderstands as being the opposite of God, when in fact it is the very essence of God!
</p>

<p>
	See how tricky language can be?
</p>

<p>
	By being existence, you will come know yourself as God.
</p>

<title>Is mental illness attached to the ego?</title>

<p>
	In reality these are very complex issues with many possible factors. Of course ego and psychology plays a huge role, but brain health and diet also plays an important role. For example, if your brain is filled with toxic chemicals like lead and mercury, good luck feeling well.
</p>

<p>
	You have to research and investigate what your root issues are. Ego is always gonna be a huge factor but there might also be other factors.
</p>

<p>
	A lot of mental illness is due to traumatic and terrible childhoods, improper parenting, etc. BTW, I don't consider depression a mental illness. Yes, ego is also closely related to mental illnesses because what happens is that early childhood trauma is not properly dealt with by the ego, which then produces all sorts of dysfunctions. Of course serious mental illnesses can also have physiological factors. It's usually a combination of factors.
</p>

<p>
	Don't underestimate how powerful the ego is. It's running your whole life pretty much. It dictates most of your survival strategies and emotional reactions.
</p>

Allow them and just watch them like clouds in the sky. Sometime they will take hold of you. Strong emotions will hypnotize you into a trace of believing in them. Just do your best to notice that and take a step back and witness it. That is all.
</p>

<p>
	Your job in this work is to make EVERY form/perception an object of your witnessing. It cannot become an object to witness if you are identified with it. To witness it, you must first disidentify with it. So for example, you are not the sensation in your chest, you are that which is witnessing that sensation. You are not the thought of yourself, you are that which is witnessing that thought. You are not the hunger in your belly, you are that which is witnessing that feeling. Etc.
</p>

<p>
	Just keep practicing that as much as you can throughout the day. The more the better. You will become more and more detached from everything, which is the goal. Eventually you should have an awakening to Absolute Emptiness that is your true identity. It will come suddenly and out of the blue. Often it's jolting.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, keep entering that state of not-knowing what anything is. That's very good. That is the best state to be in for an awakening to happen.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Go and actually study and gain experience with attracting girls and being social. Do that first. Fill that need. Then you can return to enlightenment work. You are getting ahead of yourself, jumping into too advanced territory without having done the basics. That's why you're frustrated.
</p>

<p>
	GO SOCIALIZE WITH REAL GIRLS!!!
</p>

<p>
	Stop trying to avoid it. You are using the idea of enlightenment to avoid doing basic self-help stuff. That is not right.

<p>
	You are not anything. Keep disidentifying with everything until nothing remains. It's basically as simple as that. The ego will of course react and object and throw hissy-fits.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever negative reactions are arising, you must watch them without identifying with them or taking them too seriously. Like watching clouds passing through the sky. The sky does not get bothered by the clouds. You are like the sky. Be like the sky.
</p>

<p>
	Insecurity is one of those clouds passing through.
</p>

<p>
	One awakening is rarely enough to fully disidentify from the body/mind. Keep challenging anything you identify with. Keep asking yourself, "What am I still identified with? Can I let that go?" Your ultimate goal is to completely disidentify with the entire sensory realm. All forms must be dropped. No form is your true identity. Your true identity is totally empty, a Void.

Not any particular object, but just the pure fact of existence itself. What is that?
</p>

<p>
	Existence itself is not a color, object, material, sound, feeling, thought, etc. It is not even an experience or a perception. What is it then?

<p>
	It's very important for everyone here to understand that not all people react to 5-MeO alike. I have seen people take 30mg of good, 99% substance without much reaction.
</p>

<p>
	Don't expect everyone to be able to take 20mg and have an epic breakthrough experience like I talk about. You need to find what dose and method works best for you. This is an individualized thing.

<p>
	It's purely a right-wing propaganda channel. It does not even attempt to understand the issues.
</p>

<p>
	One good thing about PragerU is that it reveals who the fake experts are. Any "expert" or "intellectual" you see on in their videos automatically exposes himself as a clown, and is never to be taken seriously.

<p>
	Well, nothingness is not something. And also it is <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" /> (sorry for the Zen-speak)
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness is existence itself. If you just sit with a quiet mind in silence you can sort of "feel" existence. Although feeling is not quite the right word. You can be conscious of existence.
</p>

<p>
	Try this: just sit and focus your attention on the raw fact of existence itself. I don't mean on the existence of any particular object, but existence itself. Try to "lock on" to existence itself. Notice it has no shape. It has no form. It is not an object. Yet here it is! But WHAT IS IT? What is existence? Try to just sit and be "locked on" to that for 15 minutes with a very open mind. Don't theorize or speculate. Just observed what existence is. Have a very open mind free of any ideas, models, images, or theories about what existence is. Whatever existence is, it's right there in your direct experience. if you can't realize what it is using your direct experience, you will never realize it (not through books, videos, or teaching).
</p>

<p>
	Can you sort of "feel" that existence is nothing? It is empty. Good. Now just sit with that. Focus on that emptiness. That is enlightenment, that is the True Self, that is the I AM, that is the Godhead.
</p>

<p>
	Also notice that anything you say about pure existence itself is not accurate. Any description or qualification of it is not true because it is empty. It is so empty that even calling it "empty" is untrue! So what do you do? You just sit and observe it silently without too much thinking. Let it captivate you. Rather than being human, become it!
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The mind is NOT the I AM. The mind will try to make itself feel and think that it is the I AM, so watch out! You must detach from all mind activity. That doesn't mean all mind activity must stop, it just means you must not identify with it.
</p>

<p>
	What you are looking for is Nothingness. But it cannot be found using the mind. So how do you find it? There is no way, no method to get to it. A radical leap in consciousness is required. That comes naturally with lots of practice witnessing and observing your direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	You must throw out all analogies. Enlightenment/Nothingness cannot be accessed via an analogy AT ALL. Every analogy is not it. You must become the Nothingness directly! It has to be totally direct. You cannot form an image or idea of it. Any idea you have of it is not it. This is why it's so frustrating and difficult.
</p>

<p>
	Closest you can get to Nothingness via a technique is just sitting in silence with a very still mind.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Notice, even to understand that a cake goes in an oven requires that you make use of the intellectual capacities of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	In a strictly materialist universe, no understanding would be possible at all. You could not understand how to tie your shoes. Understanding is a divine capacity. And since you are God, your capacity to understand yourself is infinite.
</p>

<p>
	The little things you understand in your everyday life, like how to turn on the lights in your house, is a tiny, tiny fraction of the intelligence of the super-mind which you can tap into. With super-mind you can understand amazing things about reality which seem impossible to ordinary people. For example, you can understand why wars happen, or why corruption exists, or why racism exists, etc.

<p>
	See, the problem is, every force in nature has a countervailing force. So the force of enlightening others will be countered by the force of ignorance and devilry.
</p>

<p>
	Key insight: people are not awake because they don't want to be, not because something is seriously stopping them. People like their illusions. When you try to take that away from them, don't be surprised if they kill you.
</p>

<p>
	If everyone awoke tomorrow, the entire civilization would collapse. So civilization needs to evolve before mass awakening is possible.

</blockquote>

<p>
	I don't disagree with Sadhguru at all. You must be careful in which context a word like "logic" is being used. Logic can mean a lot of different things to different people.
</p>

<p>
	The things I talk about are not logical per se. They are trans-rational. They are more intuitive and conscious than logical.
</p>

<p>
	But at the same time logic is not separate from Truth. The universe clearly has order and Logos to it. It is has an intelligible design.
</p>

<p>
	Becoming conscious of how everything is interconnected is far beyond logical. It is direct consciousness + supermind. It is one of the highest truths there is. Show me two things which are not connected.

	Plug 20-30mg of 5-MeO salt in a quiet room all by yourself and there you go. Godhead.
</p>

<p>
	Mushrooms and LSD are decent alternatives if you can't access 5-MeO. Don't underestimate the power of mushrooms and LSD.
</p>

<p>
	Don't trip with other people. They disrupt the trip. Teach yourself how to trip solo in quiet.

	It sounds like you're on the right track. Remember, the real fruits of this work will come 5-10 years into it.

	Don't think of it as, "Oh man... you mean I have to wait 10 years?" No! What I'm saying is that after 10 years of great results, your results will them explode into unspeakable, God-like, super-human realms which no one would ever believe. The end-game of personal development is epic. That should motivate you to do the work.
</p>

<p>
	I did not wait for 10 years to get a big result. I was getting lots of results throughout those entire 10 years. Then God was the cherry on top of my sundae.
</p>

<p>
	Don't feel bad for doing simple personal development, working on your career, working on your biz, learning attraction, developing experience and confidence, etc. That basic stuff is important so that later in life you can dive into spirituality from a solid foundation.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics will super-charge all this. Solo retreats will super-charge all this. Then again, psychedelics can derail your productivity and work ethic because the truths they reveal are so far beyond everyday survival activities that you will stop caring about money, sex, and work. Since I started doing psychedelics 2 years ago my work output and business productivity has suffered quite a bit. But what I lost in productivity I made up in profundity and authenticity. The metaphysical life is not very "practical". That comes with pros and cons.
</p>

<p>
	Then again, I am still able to run a business. But I would not be able to start a business on psychedelics. For starting business you need to be 110% focused on the business for at least a few years.
</p>

<p>
	It's smart to split your life up into chapters:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		Chapter 1: Schooling & Education
	</li>
	<li>
		Chapter 2: Getting a Job
	</li>
	<li>
		Chapter 3: Health & Fitness
	</li>
	<li>
		Chapter 4: Starting A Business / Life Purpose
	</li>
	<li>
		Chapter 5: Earning Good Money, Building Up A Nest Egg
	</li>
	<li>
		Chapter 6: Self-Help
	</li>
	<li>
		Chapter 7: Attraction, Dating, Relationships
	</li>
	<li>
		Chapter 8: Spirituality & Consciousness Work
	</li>
	<li>
		Chapter 9: Psychedelics
	</li>
	<li>
		Chapter 10: Hardcore Yoga / Pursuing Enlightenment
	</li>
	<li>
		Chapter 11: Starting A Family
	</li>
	<li>
		Etc.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Those are only some ideas, not a specific formula. Each chapter is done sequentially for a 1-5 years. You must figure out which chapters you need, which you don't, and what order is right for you to do them in.
</p>

<p>
	My view has not really changed. Here we are talking about it in the context of a serious yogic practice designed to raise kundalini. Obviously it would be beneficial not to squander your 2nd chakra energy when you are trying to raise kundalini.
</p>

<p>
	Ordinary people who are not trying to raise their kundalini can masturbate on occasion without much problem, as long as it doesn't become an addition that takes over your life.
</p>

<p>
	You can even masutrbate and do Kriya yoga, it will just take you longer to raise kundalini.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Your problem here is that you fundamentally overlook what understanding and communication are. Understanding is not a literal thing. The mind can understand things in various ways and at various levels. Do not dismiss this as: "Oh, it's mind stuff so it's all unreal." No, that's way too sloppy and incorrect. The mind can understand things correctly.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible, for example, to understand how God works. This involves some use of the mind, but this is like supermind, not ordinary mind. It is mind plus a high state of consciousness. The insights are not linear or rational or verbal.
</p>

<p>
	Supermind is a thing you're overlooking because you've watched too many videos of gurus telling you to stop thinking. That is good advice but it's rather blunt, partial, and not nuanced enough. This advice is not absolute, it has a limited context. Don't take it too literally.
</p>

<p>
	A good yogi develops supermind in addition to whatever awakenings or samadhi's he has.
</p>

<p>
	I see many of you guys here lack nuance. You got it in your mind that all there is is awakening to no-self and no-mind, all there is is asking Who am I? Well, that's very sloppy and misses a ton of valuable other stuff. In fact, some of the best stuff has nothing to do with Who am I?
</p>

<p>
	Thus you have no ancillary understanding like:
</p>

<p>
	What is language? What is science? What is communication? What is relationship? What is reason? What is society? What is government? What is culture? What is understanding? What is art? What is evolution? What is health? What is a fractal? Etc.
</p>

<p>
	There is way more to this work than enlightenment.
</p>

<p>
	Your notion of "real" makes little difference. The formed world is nothing, but it still has a structure and is worthwhile to study and understand. You can say that kangaroos aren't real, but someone else can go and study a kangaroo and discover amazing things about it. You could say, "But a kangaroo is just a thought." No it isn't. You could say, "But who needs a kangaroo when you can access God?" But the kangaroo is God too! By studying a kangaroo in the right way you are studying a facet of God. To really appreciate God you might need to look a kangaroo in the face.
</p>

<p>
	The formed world is not less valuable than the Void. If it were, that would be a subtle duality.
</p>

<p>
	Concepts are not bad or wrong, just don't confuse them with the empty I AMNESS.
</p>

By the end when I was doing it I just stopped caring about fear/anxiety/etc. It now feels very natural. Although I have had hairy trips which most people would feak out over.
</p>

<p>
	No, my mind does not resist the 5-MeO. Whatever it wants to show me I am open to. Sometimes it slaps me around but I am okay with it. I surrender to it completely. I think the key is to have your heart in the right place. That is enough to overcome any minor ego stuff which we all tend to have. You don't need to be totally pure, just pure enough.
</p>

<p>
	For me 5-MeO is like a good guru: stern yet loving and good. I have not noticed that it slaps you around frivolously like some other psychedelics might. It just shows you Truth, and if you can handle it, you'll be good. So 5-MeO is only for those people who really crave and love Truth unconditionally.
</p>

And I am you, so any devils out there are not other than me.
</p>

<p>
	But I'm also aware that I am God and a devil. Are you? That makes an important difference. How much of your own devilry can you see? The more you can see, the less of devil you will be, since the devil can only do his work in the shadow of unconsciousness.

	It is a tool for growth.
</p>

<p>
	Why is this so hard to understand?
</p>

<p>
	Arnold used steroids for competiton but this is not what made him so good. It was his mindset and hard work.
</p>

<p>
	If you think steroids will make you a great athlete you will be disappointed. They are merely a tool.
</p>

<p>
	And no, psychedelics are not unhealthy like steroids.

<p>
	Of course. How else could it be?

<p>
	Who is there to judge a devil but another devil?
</p>

<p>
	The seeing of imperfection is itself devilry. And that too is perfect.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing you have to do to end your devilry is to accept everything exactly as it is. In other words, accept Truth. But of course, precisely because you are a devil you will absolutely refuse to do this, and what's more, you will tell yourself that you are right for refusing. Such is the way of the devil. He is hopelessly lost in his own delusion. Almost beyond help. Almost.

<p>
	Get some experience first, then devise your plans.

<p>
	You are trying to use 5-MeO as a get out of jail free card, and that won't work. You can't skip the inner work. But you can speed it up.

<p>
	Practices are very important. You will not get much out of 5-MeO without practices.
</p>

<p>
	You don't want to turn 5-MeO into a crutch. It is a powerful tool, but only a tool. It cannot be your cure-all fix. You ultimately want to be free of it.
</p>

<p>
	There is so much more to this work than just blasting 5-MeO up your ass.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind, when I do that, that's based on a very deep foundation of many years of inquiry, research, practice, and self-help. And even so, I don't do it all the time, I do it very strategically at certain periods of the year.
</p>

<p>
	Practically speaking, you will never be able to handle that much 5-MeO. It will totally disrupt your life and you will not be able to integrate it fast enough, leading to all sorts of emotional problems.
</p>

<p>
	Integrating 13 trips took me a lot of work. I pushed myself to the limit. And it took me 2 years of tripping to be able to do that. Don't try that at home.

Particles are pure mental abstraction. What is really there are infinitely entangled qunatum wave functions.
</p>

<p>
	Particle never existed. That was a cute story told to you in grade school because the reality of the sub-atomic world is infinitely complex and impossible to model perfectly.
</p>

<p>
	There can be nothing more fundamental than nothingness and infinity. No form is fundamental. All "particles" come and go, born and die -- as QM tells you.
</p>

<p>
	You must interpret QM very carefully. QM does NOT support materialism or realism at all.

</p>

<p>
	The point is to keep an open mind. The open mind applies more to new perspectives and ideas, rather than your values and stengths. You don't need to be too skeptical of your values and strengths. Listen to your heart and you will discover your top values and strengths.
</p>

<p>
	But you still need an open mind when it comes to new perspectives.
</p>

<p>
	That's right, the mind craves certainty just like the body craves food. Which is why openmindness is so hard for people. It goes counter to that.

<title>Q&amp;A: Realization of God's Perfect Design and it's Consequences</title>

<p>
	If you started to behave unharmoniously, eventually there would be a countervailing force that stopped you. That is the genius of the design. It balances the autonomy of agents within Creation with community.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is balanced on a razer's edge. Allowing maximum diversity and interconnection.
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose is nothing you have to do, it's something you might want to do when you realize the enjoy of creating.

<p>
	Ideally not. But it's better to do both than not doing yoga at all.
</p>

<p>
	Don't let perfectionism get in the way of growth.

<p>
	If you are young and undeveloped you will not be able to not masturbate. You might as well try to stop peeing.

You have turned it into an idea, a belief. This is a classic defense mechanism.
</p>

<p>
	Honestly it does not sound like you are even ready to pursue enlightenment, not to mention the thousands of hours of intense self-inquiry and deconstructive work it will take just for you to get your first glimpse of what "no me" actually is. And that will only be the start.
</p>

<p>
	This work requires brutal honesty and accuracy. Start by at least admitting you believe you were born and that you are a human. That is what you not only believe but feel at a cellular level. It's totally untrue, but to you it feels like truth and reality. So start by acknowledging that. Then maybe you could start to question it a bit.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a quick peak of what no-me means, try some mushrooms or LSD. That will give you a small taste of where this work leads. A small taste.
</p>

<p>
	I would start you off with just basic philosophical questioning of reality. Like, how do you know you're not in a computer simulation, or dreaming? How do you know other people exist? How do you know your parents are really your parents? How do you know your own mind isn't deceiving you? How do you know science is valid? How do you know an external material world exists? How do you know you will die?
</p>

<p>
	Start to question your metaphysics. Like REALLY start questioning it. Not as idle speculation, but seriously, like it might all be an illusion.
</p>

<p>
	I have already told you. Something and nothing look identical. Everything you see is nothing.
</p>

<p>
	You must awaken to the fact that zero = infinity.
</p>

<p>
	God didn't get bored per se. That's just a cute metaphor. The more accurate explanation is that God simply IS. It is zero, it is infinity. God isn't really doing anything per se, God is just being God, and so it IS the whole world you encounter. God creates directly by BEING. God does not need a mechanism for creation. It's totally effortless and direct. There isn't a process, it's just pure materialization from thin air using God's infinite will, because God is all-powerful it can do that.
</p>

<p>
	Another way to phrase it it is: nothing have ever happened. Which is identical to saying everything happened all at once. A good metaphor for it is that it's like a giant cosmic explosion frozen in time. Since time is part of the creative explosion. It's an infinite creative explosion spreading out in infinite directions without beginning or end.
</p>

<p>
	To understand this you must inquire not only Who am I? but What is reality? What is existence? You must awaken to what reality is. Of course reality is you. But WHAT IS IT??? Why is it here? How did it get here? And where is here?
</p>

<p>
	All of the above can be answered and understood, Absolutely.
</p>

<p>
	Find out for yourselves. All you've got are beliefs on this matter.
</p>

<p>
	If you think that enlightened people cannot have false beliefs or be closedminded, you really don't understand how the human mind works. You'll be in for a rude awakening.

<p>
	There are layers to human growth and development. There is the psychological layer, the social layer, the existential layer, etc. Each layer is important. Of course beliefs are important. Even the most enlightened people still hold thousands of beliefs which dictate their actions and attitudes towards things.
</p>

<p>
	For example I once told a highly enlightened guy to try some 5-MeO-DMT. He refused because he said it cannot possibly show people enlightenment. That was a belief, and a false one as well.
</p>

<p>
	No matter how enlightened you get you can still have false beliefs about the world.

			this is where we disagree. the movement already has an unstoppable momentum. "serious" scientists won't be able to do anything about it. human culture will transform faster as more people are falling in existential crisis. it's a natural flow. of course you can scream and say "my scream is part of the natural flow". but you can also work quietly and peacefully and say "my calmness is part of the flow". up to existence!

<p>
	I'm just saying a deconstruction is necessary along the veins of what Thomas Kuhn's or Paul Feyerbend's work did in the 20th century for science. More of that is needed. It does not have to be screaming rant. Deconstruction can be calm. Or not. Both can be useful.

<p>
	No! You're not getting it. THIS IS THE PERFECT DESIGN! There is nothing perfecter.
</p>

<p>
	Any design you imagine would be worse than God's design. Seriously! Think about how profound what I am saying is. I'm not making this shit up. It REALLY is that case that this is Absolute Perfection. The imperfections are in your way of looking at it.
</p>

<p>
	It's as though you are looking at a massive flawless diamond through dirty glasses. So you keep seeing imperfections and blaming the diamond. What you need to do is open yourself up the possibility that the imperfections are an illusion created by your ego-mind. If you do that, if you clean your lenses, you will see that the diamond was always flawless. And your heart will melt.
</p>

<p>
	Wash yourself of yourself if you wish to see the highest truths. There is no other way. The lens of the microscope must be clean to get accurate results.

Dean Radin would be dismissed and rejected by most scientists. They would call him a kook, not a scientist. His paranormal research is rejected across the board by serious scientists. Not because he is wrong but because they are dogmatic materialists.
</p>

<p>
	People hold science in way too high a regard. So I think some bashing is a nice counter to that. A culture war is needed here to some degree. Right now people take science way too much on faith. It's part of the Orange stage.
</p>

<p>
	What's really needed is a full, methodical deconstruction of science, which I am in the process of writing.
</p>

<p>
	Obviously you are more conscious than the typical scientist because you did consciousness work. Very, very few scientists are as wise as Einstein or Tesla. You picked two of the best of all time. That's unfair. I am talking more about your run of the mill scientists. Those who poo-poo metaphysical inquiry.
</p>

<p>
	Science advances and evolves precisely through the critiques which I am verbalizing. This is true scientific method happening right here, right now in this thread! We are pointing out it's limitations so that it can become more pure. But as always, scientists hate it when you point out the impurities of science. They go into defense mode. It's an ego thing. They are committed to the survival of science, which ironically entrenches the impurities. Such is how all corruption works. The whistleblower gets demonized. I am the whistleblower. So scientists will demonize me.
</p>

	See, science is a collective ego. That's a profound insight. Go check out my Collective Ego episode and connect the dots. Science is not yet conscious enough to realize that it is a collective ego and all the ramifications this has. So we must make science aware of this to evolve it to the next level.

<p>
	Any time I capitalize a word I am talking about an Absolute. Good vs good. Good with a capital G is an Absolute. Absolute means it has no opposite. Yes, you can think of good vs evil, but then there is Good which has no opposite (which means it is ALL). When you are conscious of the Absolute Good, you realize evil has never existed. Only Good exists.
</p>

<p>
	Good for whom? Good for the totality of existence. Good for you as God. May not be good for the ego.

	Every creation is that way. Have you looked at how living creatures evolve? They are all hodge-podges of past creatures. No creature is ever created out of thin air in one step. Nor is any vehicle or human gadget or invention. They all require gradual refinement and evolutionary innovation. And yet, each creature still have original parts.

<p>
	I doubt LSD will do it. But who knows. Maybe a very high dose will. I've never experienced anything like that. What's far more profound is to realize that you are ALL lives simultaneously. You are not limited to some chain of past lives at all. You are Hitler right now. There is nothing which you are not.

<p>
	Sounds in the right ballpark. I don't remember all the details of his theory. But Tom Campbell is not fully awake. His theory states that time is fundamental, which is false. He also says that reality is finite, which is false. He does not have a good understanding of infinity. He's still thinking of reality too much in physicist terms.
</p>

<p>
	With that said, his work is full of valuable and practical insights. It's just not the highest teaching or truth. Which is okay, but Absolute Infinity blows all that out of the water.

<title>Will Science ever prove Non-Duality?</title>

<br />


							
							
<p>
	Materialism is the belief in an external physical world which exists independent of the human mind. And it's the belief that this belief is not a belief but reality. It is the belief that consciousness is made out of material objects like neurons or brains. It is also the belief that the universe is dumb and inanimate.
</p>

<p>
	Models of reality are not the problem. The problem is that groundless metaphysical assumptions are rampant throughout science but at the same time materialist science poo-poos metaphysics, as if metaphysics is bullshit, but without any awareness that science is full of implicit materialist metaphysics for which there never was any scientific evidence.
</p>

<p>
	Another big problem is that scientists are NOT aware that their models are just abstractions. Serious scientists like Max Tegmark or Sean Carroll literally believe that the universe is mathematics or literally a quantum field equation. It's so ridiculous it's tragic.
</p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	What you are are overlooking is that creation IS constraint, IS limitation. God has not constraints, he can create whatever he wants, but once he's created it, that thing must be a certain way. God cannot create a chicken and then have it bark like a dog. To be a chicken means: can't bark like a dog. The vocal cords of a chicken cannot bark. This is not a limit on God's power. He made it that way! He doesn't want chickens to bark. They got other stuff to do.
</p>

<p>
	The design constraints are not placed upon God. God places the design constraints in the process of creation so that creation works harmonious with itself. If God created animals without suffering, those animals would not live long enough to breed. So he could do that, just like you could punch yourself in the nuts, but he's not stupid enough to do it.
</p>

<p>
	Stop assuming that suffering must be eliminated from the design, as if it's a parasite. Suffering is not some extraneous thing, it's there by design FOR YOUR GOOD! By seeking to eradicate suffering from the world you are fucking with God's design and unwittingly turning his heaven into hell.
</p>

<p>
	Suffering isn't a bug, it's a feature.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	I tried it once. Didn't like it. It was too much for doing work. And that was 10ug.
</p>

<p>
	I suppose I should try it some more. I wanted it to be a powerful technique but for me it feels like I'm better off just doing a solid trip than microdosing. Other people may feel differently, like if you're depressed or something, maybe it would be good for you.
</p>

<p>
	Modafinil feels a lot better for everyday activities and work than 10ug of LSD. Modafinil is so nice I often don't take it simply because I feel like it's cheating. Life is too good on Modafinil, LOL. You can't rely on drugs to hold up your life. Tripping is different. Tripping is a rare event which is more like a rite of passage or a retreat. So it's very different from daily dosing of drugs for life enhancement. I'm generally not a fan of near-daily dosing of anything because it becomes a crutch.
</p>

<p>
	But hey, if you can't function without it because you have bad ADHD or whatever, then it might be good for you, for a while.
</p>

<p>
	Eventually though your goal should be to be totally free of chemical crutches. Happiness must come from within.

			I hope I understand what you're saying here Leo but I struggle with this a lot. People close to me are like "what's you're opinion on this?" when my opinion is generally "there's two sides to every story, everyone feels just as justified in their own argument as the person with the counter argument. Let them have their opinion and try not to let it affect you". 
		</p>

		<p>
			I don't know what's true or false because there's two sides to every story and to weed out what's ego driven or emotionally driven is hard to separate from something that's been ingrained from culture. To find what's authentic vs. inauthentic has opened my eyes, once you find what your authentic opinion or view is then it doesn't matter what others say.
		</p>

		<p>
			As I read this I was scouring the internet for a book on discovering your authentic self. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Is there any suggestions from anyone or if there's one on the book list, what category is this under?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	What I am talking about goes much deeper than that.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not just talking about figuring out your opinions on issues, like whether you should vote for liberals or conservatives.
</p>

<p>
	What you'll discover is that virtually no cultural programming you have is authentic. It's just random stuff your mind picked up. To become authentic you need to really turn inward and disconnect from culture and people. Doing solo retreats you start to see what authentic is.
</p>

<p>
	Not even your identification with being a biological organism is authentic.
</p>

<p>
	When you get super-authentic you will look in the mirror not even view that body as being who you truly are.
</p>

<p>
	To become authentic you must peel back layer after layer after layer of false identities which you have constructed throughout your life. There are many layers to peel back. Peeling them back is challenging because your physical, emotional, and social survival depends on them. Without them you would be lost. Which needs to happen in order for you to really find yourself.
</p>

<p>
	But hey, start wherever you can. Most of you will have to start by peeling back the psychological and social layers. Look at all the mask your wear around other people. Look at all the manipulating and lying you do. Then there will be the existential layers.
</p>

<p>
	2) To overcome boredom, become creative. Create something that gives you joy. That's what art is for. Come up with a life purpose and you will rarely be bored.

</p>

<p>
	There's a lot to say about them.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, a weak self will struggle a lot to be honest, integrous, and authentic because it is too fearful. It basically can't because it is not conscious of its own true nature. Ego is a house of cards cemented with lies.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, you can push your comfort zone and be more honest. This alone will grow you. But yeah, to get a massive gain in this domain you must have some awakenings to your true nature and Absolute Truth.
</p>

<p>
	How can you be authentic and honest when you don't know what is true and what is false, what is authentic and what is inauthentic?
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are wonderful for this topic. They will make you honest by beating you into submission.
</p>

<p>
	Wait and see. There's too much to say.
</p>

<p>
	If I say, "Trump is President of the United States" is that true or false? How do you know? What makes it true? What does it even mean to say it is true? If you don't know what truth is (and you don't), how can you even say that something is true or false? What are you even saying with those words. What does it mean to say God is true? Is truth a concept or something else? If it's not a concept what is it? If it is a concept then are non-conceptual things not true? How many kinds of truth are there? One, two, three, infinity? Are colors true? Are words true? Is perception true? Can ideas be true? Are false things true or false? Do false things exist or not? Is there something in between true and false? Does truth come in degrees or it is binary? Etc, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Don't take the most basic things for granted.
</p>

<p>
	You could spend the next 20 years of your life studying what truth is and isn't and how truth works. And you would probably be wrong.
</p>

<title>is there even a point to do 60 minute self inquiry sits if 99.9% is monkey mind?</title>

</p>

<p>
	Try Kriya yoga or counting the breath to build up your concentration.
</p>

<p>
	Self-inquiry is an advanced practice which should only be done once you've calmed your mind down and are able to maintain some degree of concentration. Otherwise it just won't be effective.
</p>

<p>
	In Zen they start newbies off with counting of the breath. It's actually quite smart to do so. Count each exhale from 1 up to 10, then repeat from 1. If you lose track, start over from 1.
</p>

<p>
	Do this until your mind calms down and stops thinking about random stuff. Then you can turn towards self-inquiry more.
</p>

<p>
	It might also be helpful for you to do self-inquiry using a journal. Question whatever you identify with and try to deconstruct it on paper. This process is very good for opening you up to not-knowing. At first this questioning will be conceptual. That's okay. You have a lot of conceptual baggage to deconstruct before you can just sit and focus on the I AMNESS. For example, are your memories you? Is your DNA you? Is your brain you? Are your sensations you? All of this must be questioned and deconstructed even just conceptually.
</p>

<p>
	Sitting and focusing on the I AMNESS is a very advanced practice. It is really not for newbies. A newbie monkey mind cannot get traction with it. It's too busy, too active.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The topic of truth is not just enlightenment. I mean other aspects of truth.
</p>

<p>
	I won't be rehashing the same old stuff on this topic. The fact is 99% of people are deeply confused about what the word "truth" even means.
</p>

<p>
	What is truth? That's a profound question and the answer is not something like God or The Self. There's more nuance to it than that.
</p>

<p>
	My truth video will be very eye-opening for you even if you've watched all my enlightenment stuff. In fact the topic is so deep it requires multiple videos.
</p>

<p>
	That is not quite right because a human being DOES have some agency/will which Mario does not.
</p>

<p>
	It's not the ego's will that is in control, it's God's will. Luckily you are God. So God's will is really your will, not something outside you. Humans have a small sliver of God's will in everyday life, which the ego co-opts as its own.

</p>

<p>
	Selflessness and honesty go hand in hand.
</p>

<p>
	The conflict is between honesty and selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you lie is due to fear and selfishness. You do not lie out of selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	If you were truly selfless you would never need to lie.
</p>

Awakening reveals Truth. Don't mistake Truth with conceptual or verbal relative truths.
</p>

<p>
	I'll talk more about what truth is in the future.

Duh! Truth! Lol! Brains?? WTF is that?"
</p>

<p>
	You see, the brain is a hallucination.
