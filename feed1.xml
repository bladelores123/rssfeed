<p>
	Yes, this is potentially dangerous. Gotta be careful with that. You must definitely explore conventional medical therapies before going hog-wild on woo-woo healing techniques.

<p>
	I'm not too worried about that. They can easily adjust the vaccines now for new variants.
</p>

<p>
	The hard part was the proof of concept for rapid and safe vaccine development using mRNA. They mastered that. I'm sure they will make even better vaccines soon. And we are developing our logistics and distribution platforms too, so things will never be as bad as they were.
</p>

<p>
	Really, we need something like a mail-home vaccine DIY kit. For hyper-rapid distribution when as new virus appears. Going to the doctor to get a vaccine is silly.
</p>

<p>
	Really this covid was needed to future-proof ourselves against other, more deadly viruses. Now we will be much better prepared. So it's a net positive.

<p>
	No it wouldn't because it's absurd to expect everyone to be attracted to you.
</p>

<p>
	Even if you are Brad Pitt not every girl will be attracted to you.
</p>

<p>
	Even a 10% raw physical attraction rate is very good. You don't need more.
</p>

<p>
	Personally I know that I'm only truly attracted to maybe 1-2% of women. Which is rather a curse that I live with.

			I would say spiritual masters are in a unique environment. Their stature may allow for younger women to be attracted to them. And the spiritual master may be able to get away with it without much consequence. That is very different than 60+ men living in a Florida retirement home that doesn't encounter or attract many women. And different than a 60+ college professor that is around a lot of younger women, yet would face serious consequences if he slept with one.

<p>
	Of course hormones play a role. But that's not really fair either. Yeah, it's easy to "transcend" sexual desire by cutting your balls off. But that's not really a transcendence of desire, that's just tuning your body to stop producing the desire. That's like saying I have transcend my desire for dick -- simply by virtue of the fact that I wasn't born gay. By that logic I am a master of transcending the desire for dick. It never even arises for me. But do I really deserve credit for that?
</p>

<p>
	And furthermore, to say that one has transcended sexual desire simply because one has no sexual opportunities, is also a kind of cheat. The real test is when a hot girl rubs her ass in your lap and you are still able to say no.

	It's a complex situation. I don't think they are all full of shit. But you definitely cannot just blindly trust everything they claim. Such people tend to be highly fantastical and imaginative as a personality trait. So they can imagine a lot of stuff which may not be "objectively real".

</blockquote>

<p>
	Heavy metals do seem to cause autism in young children. But these new vaccines don't have heavy metals from what I've read and as an adult with a fully developed brain and body your situation is very different than that of young children. And you must weigh against the risk of the disease the vaccine protects you from. And you can chelate heavy metals fairly easily so it is not a permanent thing.
</p>

<p>
	So the case against covid vaccines for adults is not good. And they haven't even approved covid vaccines for kids yet.
</p>

<p>
	This is not the case.
</p>

<p>
	Most of my advice pertains to the relative domain. In your case of dealing with these healers, I'm telling you to be careful precisely for relative reasons. They can give you bad/wrong advice and you just trust them and ruin your life.
</p>

<p>
	In dealing with some of these spiritual healer type people I have found many of them to be full of shit and it would be very foolish to entrust important life decisions to them. I'm not saying it's all bad, but you gotta be skeptical of things they say because they say some bullshit that will directly contradict other spiritual healers.
</p>

<p>
	For example, I went to a top rated spiritual healer last year and asked her specifically about my health problems. She told me there is absolutely nothing wrong with my body. At first I believed her. Then I did medical testing and found out otherwise, and conclusively proved to myself that she was full of shit as I started taking medicine and feeling much better.
</p>

<p>
	Now, will she ever admit her mistake? Never. She's too high on her own spiritual bullshit.
</p>

<p>
	So from now on any time someone tells me they are a spiritual healer, I will look at them like they are an idiot. And in questioning these healers deeply I can see they are not awake, they are playing sophisticated games of self-deception and imagination.
</p>

	Children already have vaccine "passports". It's called school. You can't go to school without proper vaccine. Boo-hoo. That's the cost of moving around in a herd.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to fly around it is not too much to ask that you get a vaccine from a mutating pandemic that already killed millions.
</p>

<p>
	You libertarian types are too paranoid. No one is gonna control you with a vaccine. It's just basic public health and it costs you little to comply. Vaccine is far safer than covid so you'd be a fool not to take it. And it costs so little.
</p>

<p>
	From what I understand these new vaccines do not contain mercury, so your case against them drops to nill.

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's tricky to say. I don't know exactly. Some people get stuck chasing the same desire endlessly forever.
</p>

<p>
	I think it probably involves experiencing enough of it that you get sick of it and are ready to move on to higher things. It also requires exploration of higher joys.
</p>

<p>
	I feel like I have almost extinguished my desire for junk food. It used to be so hard to say no, now it is almost effortless. And I had a lot of junk food in the past, but it caused me so much suffering I don't want it any more.
</p>

<p>
	Lower desires tend to bring a lot of suffering which you can use against them. But it requires going through that suffering. Play so much video games that you are disgusted with yourself.
</p>

<p>
	It certainly helps a lot when you discover higher spiritual dimensions to life. You can use spiritual joy to replace the seeking of base cravings and raw pleasure.
</p>

<p>
	Sex is still a desire I have not figured out. It's so powerful and intoxicating. I see few spiritual masters have conquered it even in their 60s.
</p>

<p>
	If you are Infinite Consciousness, imagining a hell is just part of your game. God is an infinite dream, so it will have some dark corners, as your human dreams do.
</p>

<p>
	I've had some dreams which were borderline hell. I've experienced a sort of hyper-hell, which is hell in more than 3 dimensions. It is not a fun place. It will make you forget that love exists.

			It's normal when you have a relatively good job. If you're an engineer at Amazon you'll get generous bonuses and shares as well. Which makes sense because engineers provide a lot of value to Amazon. If you're not providing much value don't complain people don't want to share profits with you.

<p>
	Yes, you can of course abstain from cravings and desires. But that rarely extinguishes them. They tend to come back.

<p>
	Sounds nice in theory but it just isn't true.
</p>

<p>
	You hunger will not go away from doing the work, but when your belly is filled.
</p>

<p>
	Sure, you will feel better about yourself if you stop procrastinating and start taking action towards solving your desire. But that doesn't satisfy the desire itself. At least not in the basic cases of hunger, sex, etc. Maybe in some very high level cases that could work.
</p>

<p>
	But a desire for sex will not be satisfied by anything other than sex. Or simply by letting the desire go entirely. But it will come back! You can't let go of sex so easily.

He was talking about presenting a strong rhetorical case more than a focus on facts or data. Which is how you persuade people.
</p>

<p>
	The entire reason right-wing media is so persuasive is because they focus on culture war emotional issues. It has nothing to do with truth, facts, data, or policy. The average rube does not care about anything but emotional appeals.

<p>
	Certainly not. This is not what is being proposed. We are talking about employees. And even then, we are not talking about giving away control but about profit distribution. A CEO would still have most say and control over a company. The janitor at Amazon is not going to make executive business decisions. But he will get a nice salary if the company is successful.
</p>

<p>
	I would also make exceptions for small businesses. If a business has less than 20 or 50 employees, then it will not be regulated as strictly and there will be less or no requirements for significant profit sharing since such businesses have far less social responsibility.
</p>

<p>
	Actualized.org is not buying politicians, etc.

	The numbers will be whatever they will be. If you distributed $200 billion across all Amazon employees that would be a very significant number. You could make 100,000 millionaires!

<p>
	In practice a high progressive tax rate would be sufficient in most cases. And some wealth tax.

	Investing and loans do have some legit role. The problem is that in today's market they are WAY out of healthy proportion.

	A hell realm is just a bad dream. God dreams infinite dreams, so what is a hell realm to him? Just like a bit of daydreaming to you. Does it bother you when you get a stray daydream? No. It's just a natural function of your mind. You never ask, "But why was I cursed with that evil daydream?"

			Of course. Have you ever worked for a company with a falling share price? It's shit. They pay shit, treat employees poorly, layoff people and all kinds of exciting projects get cancelled. So, even when you're not seeding a startup, it's still very important for the company.

<p>
	Have you heard of Amazon? Their stock prices are soaring yet they still treat their employees like shit.
</p>

<p>
	Look, I'm not saying a serious investor shouldn't get some return on his investment. But a billion times return like today's CEO's? Hell no.
</p>

<p>
	You could cut returns by 95% and things would still be fine. Take Jeffo Bezo's returns down from $200 billion to $50 million. Give the rest to the laborers who do the actual labor. Likewise for all major corporations. There will still be rich CEOs and investors, just not insanely rich. Cap income at $50 mil and the world will be a better place. There is no reason why anyone should hold over $50 mil no matter how many companies they start. If they don't want to work after $50 mil, fuck them. Let them retire. But such people will choose to work anyway because they can't stand retirement, so nothing will be lost.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Of course everything is subjective. Objectivity does not exist in my worldview.
</p>

<p>
	In this case value is simply whatever mankind finds valuable or desirable. Whatever helps mankind's survival. Value basically = survival. And all survival is relative. But human survival has many common features such as food, water, sex, land, housing, cars, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Middlemen and resellers, for example, add very little value to the world, thus they are often made disposable by nature. Anything in nature that adds little value eventually gets killed off.
</p>

<p>
	For example, kings got killed off because they didn't add sufficient value to society. They mostly leeched value.

		<p>
			Leo, you often say that you need to be creative to succeed on market and in life. Can you please elaborate - what do you mean by being creative?
		</p>

		<p>
			Does it mean to provide value to people, like, being productive and useful?
		</p>

		<p>
			Does it mean to create something new that did not exist before (find new solution, create new product, new approach, new method, new kind of service)?
		</p>

		<p>
			Or is it a mindset when you are focused on doing something for your authentic reasons?
		</p>

		<p>
			What do you mean by "being creative"?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, creativity is a deep topic. Creativity has many degrees to it.
</p>

<p>
	For the purposes of this thread my definition of creativity is quite a low bar. Just basically any kind of labor that you do which generates value in and of itself without stealing another's labor.
</p>

<p>
	In this case, getting paid to pick strawberries is creative work while getting paid on your shares of ownership of the strawberry company is not creative work, it is leeching value because the core value of the company comes from the strawberry pickers rather than the stock holders. You can easily tell that because if we kill the strawberry pickers the company will not be profitable, but if we kill the stockholders the company will still be just as profitable.
</p>

<p>
	In general our society should be structured such that people who do the most labor get the most rewards. Today it is the other way around. The most rewards go to people who often do literally zero labor. And daytrading is not labor.
</p>

<p>
	See, this is buy design. It's basically a remnant of slavery. Under slavery, the guys who do the most labor get paid zero while the guys who do zero labor get paid everything. And then those guys who get paid everything have the gall to say that they are actually doing labor by whipping the slaves to work.
</p>

<p>
	That is still effectively our system, just abstracted a bit. And most people are in denial about it. Especially those who profit from it.
</p>

<p>
	Ain't it sweet to make money for doing nothing while others slave away?
</p>

<p>
	The big oversight that people like this make is confusing truth with persuasion.
</p>

<p>
	Truth has little to do with persuasion, and what these YT debaters are doing is playing persuasion games. Debate is not a valid method of accessing truth.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something sounds persuasive or reasonable does not make it true.

			Still not clear on this. If someone claims that they can levitate, isn't the notion of 'evidence' is very simple? That I (or other third-party auditors) can literally see the person levitate, that's it. If the guy can float in the air, cool, film it, have 100 scientists observe real-time and upload it to YouTube or something, and rake in the million dollars like Carl mentioned. I'm not a materialist btw, I'm just confused as to why this hasn't happened yet.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Oh, that's very easy to answer.
</p>

<p>
	If someone posted a video of actual, genuine levitation on YT, your mind would simply never believe it to be real. You would call it a hoax.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind will not accept that which runs counter to its deepest metaphysics.
</p>

<p>
	You can't get 100 scientists to observe it in real time because no serious scientist would believe it enough to even buy a plane ticket to see it for himself. And even if they did, you would just dismiss those scientists are deluded kooks -- not real scientists, because only a kook would buy a plane ticket to see levitation -- obviously.
</p>

<p>
	So how can you prove something which you know isn't real?
</p>

<p>
	You see? You have shut your eyes and complain that you cannot see and yet you ask us to help you. No one can help you in this case until your realize you are actively shutting your eyes on purpose.

<p>
	Take a look at how numbers work. Numbers are infinitely finite. Each number is finite yet there are infinitely many of them, and you can sub-divide each finite number an infinite number of times more, and each of those you can also sub-divide infinite more times, ad infinitum.
</p>

<p>
	Infinity is a highly paradoxical thing. Contradiction is not a bug, it's a feature. If thinking about infinity breaks your mind, that's not a mistake, that's the nature of infinity!
</p>

<p>
	Infinity creates a lot of paradox and breaks all finite systems, which is why scientists tend to avoid it and sweep it under the rug. When a physicist encounters an infinity in his calculations/equations he considers it a mistake and looks for a way to hide it. But of course the only mistake is him thinking it was a mistake and trying to hide it.

<title>Scientific evidence for psychic powers</title>

<p>
	The problem goes way deeper than that. The problem is in how your mind defines "evidence" and "proof". These are not simple notions, these notions are relative to one's metaphysical and epistemic paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that a materialistic paradigm does not have a robust and subtle enough notion of "evidence" and "proof" to accomodate paranormal phenomena, therefore it is blind to them and says they can't exist.
</p>

<p>
	Color can't exist for one who super-glued his eyelids shut.

<p>
	Precisely because there is no thing that would stop it.
</p>

<p>
	Stopping a thing requires another thing. But if there are no things, then there are no obstacles either.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

<p>
	No. Nothing is doing that.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	There would also be nothing to stop nothing from creating something.
</p>

<p>
	All things are just imaginations of consciousness. You're still stuck in materialism.
</p>

<p>
	You are not appreciating the relativity of things. Stop assuming that things exist as objective facts. They don't. They only exist if your consciousness holds them.
</p>

<p>
	Even the notion of a "thing" or an object is merely something you dreamed up. If you stop dreaming of objects there will be no objects. Reality is not made out of objects nor is reality as a whole an object itself.
</p>

<p>
	It is all nothing, it is all emptiness.
</p>

<p>
	You are making the mistake of still distinguishing and being biased. You think nothing is somehow different and distinct from something. Which is a duality.
</p>

<blockquote class="ipsQuote" data-ipsquote="">

	<div class="ipsQuote_contents">
		<p>

		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Because duality is a part of nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	There is possibility for EVERYTHING because reality is unlimited. So what would stop it?
</p>

<p>
	A more conventional explanation would sound like this: nothing cannot stop something from appearing, since to stop a thing requires something to exist. Hence something must come into existence because nothing prevents it.
</p>

<p>
	But even this explanation is not correct because it still assumes a duality between nothing and something. As if something came out of nothing. NO! Something did not come out of nothing. Something has always been nothing. The only full explanation is that something = nothing.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't get it, it's because you haven't awoken to the fact that everything you see and hear is nothing. And no amount of logicking this will do it.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot substitute for lack of awakening by thinking some more.

<p>
	You probably just lack experience. Socialization requires lots of experience, so hatch a plan to gain massive experience. The solution here is pretty simple but you must do it to get results. You can't fix this problem sitting on your couch thinking about it.
</p>

<p>
	I used to have horrible social anxiety. Lots of experience solved it.

<p>
	The purpose is to underscore the entitlement and wrong expectation of life to be easy and served up to you on silver platter.

	Nothing personal. But you guys gotta toughen up.

Reframe it more as socialization rather than trying to sell yourself. And enjoy the process.

<p>
	All survival/life is by definition finite and scarcity-based.
</p>

<p>
	For you to have a puppy means that someone else does not get to have that puppy. No way around this.
</p>

<p>
	Even your preference to live in a democracy is an infringement on someone else's preference to live in a fascist state. The two are mutually exclusive.
</p>

<p>
	Hence life is always full of conflict.

<p>
	You are giving me reasons for why pigs like playing in the mud. I already know that. My job is to show you how to stop being a pig. Meanwhile you are telling me why most pigs must continue to be pigs and why being a pig is a good strategy.
</p>

<p>
	If you want to be a pig, go ahead. I am busy teaching people how to rise above that.

But in-person game is much more favorable to effort.
</p>

<p>
	If you put in lots of effort hitting the streets and clubs you will attract some stunning girls. The same cannot be said with online.

</p>

<p>
	A) What you consider creative is too limited. Being creative is not just about being an artist.
</p>

<p>
	B) What I am saying is personal advice. It is not meant to be a solution that fixes the whole world overnight. Yes, if you live in Iraq you will have a hard time being creative.
</p>

<p>
	You need to distinguish between personal advice vs public policy.

<p>
	Don't get me wrong, you can certainly make enormous money by stealing and leeching. But don't be shocked when you try to leech but you get leeched instead.
</p>

<p>
	By being a leech you enter a battle of leech against leech and who gets outleeched is up for grabs.
</p>

<p>
	See, leeching is a finite process whereas creativity is an infinite process. You'd be a fool to align yourself with the finite instead of the infinite.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, it may shock you guys, but I may buy some stocks in the future. The only difference is that: A) I don't bullshit myself about the fact that it is leeching, and B) I don't use it as a substitute for my creative work.
</p>

<p>
	The worst thing is when you get the idea that stocks are the way for you to get rich.
</p>

<p>
	For me stocks are mostly an inflation hedge. I'm not looking to get rich off trading them.

If you are attracting unloving girls, there's something weird in your way of attracting them. Diversify your source and be mindful of how you're rejecting loving girls. You can also develop screening questions to screen out unloving girls.
</p>

<p>
	SCREEN your girls before you sleep with them! Say NO to girls who don't fit your standards. Have high standards. Cure your neediness. Set boundaries.

<p>
	Strictly-speaking, the valuing of enlightenment over non-enlightenment is a bias. God doesn't really care whether it's enlightened or not.
</p>

<p>
	But of all the biases one can have, this one you should worry least about.

<p>
	Whatever kind of alt-economy you imagine, I guarantee it will be more evil than what we currently got. Because at least markets have been evolving for thousand of years. While your genius plan has never been tested and wouldn't even work for one month without being massively exploited by devils.

<p>
	1) Sounds like you are way too needy.
</p>

<p>
	2) Two girls is nothing. Statistically insignificant. Go find more and better. Not all girls are like that.
</p>

<p>
	Cure your neediness, become a strong attractive man, and you will find many sweet girls who will love you and bend over backwards for you.
</p>

<p>
	I've never had a problem finding loving girls. That's like the least problem with girls. If the girls you're with are unloving you got something weird going on. You are probably attracting that kind.

	Yes, I have a high bar for "creating value". This is not some absolute thing. I am trying to upgrade your standards as a creator. If you actually follow my advice and say No to the devil's honey, then you will come out richer than if you were trading stonks.
</p>

<p>
	Thinking you are a creator by trading stocks is just a joke. That's like thinking you are a saint for holding the door open for an old lady.

<p>
	That's a cute story. But in reality what you're doing is leeching value from the workers who are being creative. It's not like you're funding some start-up in a garage here. You're funneling money to giant companies who don't need your money other than to pay their executives billions.

<p>
	Having money in a bank account does not leech value from creative workers because you don't earn anything significant on it.
</p>

<p>
	The key is this: if you're earning a lot by doing nothing, you're leeching. Where do you think that money is coming from? It's not coming from thin air and you aren't creating it. Someone else is creating it and you're siphoning it off.

			Would you consider venture capital exploitative? Venture capital allows smart people to build huge companies quickly which they would never be able to bootstrap. Many companies end up providing huge value: Google (search, maps, YouTube), Uber, Airbnb, + smaller niche companies that do more innovative stuff.

<p>
	Yes, it's very exploitative. But also, early venture capital is more creative than what you're doing by trading stocks on Wall Street.

<p>
	Some amount of capital lending will always be necessary and good. The problem is when you start trading it for profit by adding nothing. When you buy stocks of Microsoft or Coca Cola, you're not really seeding them with capital. You're just trading and leeching.

<p>
	No! The worker's labor is being exploited and not properly rewarded. The top 0.01% own the stocks and leech value from the labor of the other 99.9% of the workers.

<p>
	It's not about learning investing. You have to look at the entire economic system as a pyramid scheme that funnels exploited value upward to those who do not work.
</p>

<p>
	Our system was deliberately designed so that those who work the least get to take the value of those who work the most. This is otherwise known as theft. You are complicit in this system when you feed money into it and get value out of it. If you don't understand the devilry of this design you are gullible.

<p>
	Yes, and that is what creates wage slavery.
</p>

<p>
	When you earn money from doing nothing you steal that money from the people who do the work.
</p>

<p>
	You call it "just investing" when really it is exploitation. You just are not honest with yourself about what you're doing because it does not benefit you to be honest about it otherwise you'd have to stop doing. So the key for you is exploit others while thinking you are a good guy.

Burden is on you to propose a better solution and I have yet to hear one. Markets are pretty awesome in their effectiveness Look at how during Covid masks and toilet paper ran out but now the market has adapted and supply is abundant.
</p>

<p>
	Markets are great, they need to be regulated for exploitation and manipulation.
</p>

<p>
	There basically needs to be a Department of Market Manipulation that has analagous power to the FBI to hunt down anyone who tries to manipulate markets and hand out felony convictions.

</p>

<p>
	Just ask yourself, what work are you doing to add genuine creative value to the world? And you will quickly see where you are a leech.
</p>

<p>
	Even when you invest into a 401k for retirement, you are still fundamentally a leech. You expect others to work for you for nothing.

	Doing mushrooms is pointless if one isn't willing to contemplate and question everything. Like a Christian he will just interpret the mushroom experience along his existing paradigmatic biases.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, he's paradigm locked. It's that simple. Can he eacape it? Yes. Will he? I doubt it. He is not interested in that.

	It has everything to do with socialism because what we are actually talking about at the highest level of abatraction is redistrubtion of resources and self-sacrifice.

<p>
	Dude, I was born in Soviet Communist Russia. The corruption there was off the charts. Everyone was supposed to be this socialist working for the good of the collective but in reality most people were so damned selfish they collected bribes under the table while proclaiming themselves to be loyal socialists.
</p>

<p>
	And do not tell me that Soviet Russia was not really socialist. They tried to be as socialist as they could and they failed at it because they were too selfish and underdeveloped to sustain it. The same thing happened in China and North Korea and pretty much every nation that attempted socialism. The attempts fail not because they were bad attempted, or because America interfered, but because mankind as a whole is not developed enough for such a collective-conscious system.
</p>

<p>
	For socialism to be sustainable the majority of the citizens must be so conscious and so selfless that they were willing to genuinely care about the greater good of society. This simply isn't possible right. Most people aren't conscious enough to feed themselves and pay the bills.
</p>

<p>
	Socialism can probably work some day, but not at our current levels of development, consciousness, and selfishness.
</p>

<p>
	If you believe that capitalists are selfish, and you believe that socialism is the cure for that, then you also believe that socialists are less selfish. And this is true. But even today's socialists are not conscious nor developed enough to actually make socialism sustainable.
</p>

<p>
	You yourself are not developed and conscious enough to make socialism work. You are overestimating your selflessness. You would not be willing to surrender toys for your children so that some children in Africa get a free meal. You don't understand what socialism requires of you at the psychological level. You think socialism will cost you nothing, but here's a better way to frame it: Are you willing to surrender a lifetime of Xmas presents for your children so that some children in Africa get a lifetime supply of food? The answer is No. What are you gonna tell your child when she cries about not getting an Xmas gift? Are you gonna look her in the eyes and tell her about Marxist theory. Get the fuck outta here. The truth is you're a selfish fuck who doesn't care about society at large. You only want this socialism for selfish reasons to begin with. As soon as you get the opportunity you get grab the money and run.
</p>

<p>
	And that is why we don't have socialism and won't have socialism in our lifetime.
</p>

<p>
	Of course your defintion of maturity is subjective and relative.
</p>

<p>
	The problem that academics and scientists have is that they do not admit the subjectivity and relativity of their own work. So they use that label "subjective" in a demeaning sense and apply it to everyone but themselves. Which is the chief delusion.
</p>

<p>
	Do not expect scientists or academics to understand or acknowledge such things because they have thoroughly brainwashed themselves as a prerequisite of success in their profression.
</p>

<p>
	You can't get a man to understamd a thing when his job depends on him not understanding it.
</p>

<p>
	Relative is the concept you're looking for here, not subjective. Human standards of beautiful people are still totally relative to culture and human biology. A dog does not find a super model beautiful.
</p>

<p>
	If we changed your genetics and culture what you find beautiful would radically change.
</p>

<p>
	And then there is the absolute perspective which is that everything in the Universe is infinitely beautiful. Which is Absolute Truth. But most people are too self-biased to see it.
</p>

<p>
	You see, the human or animal mind is simply selecting a narrow, self-biased slice of Infinite Beauty that serves its survival. Ta-da!
</p>

<p>
	No, I think it's just a matter of social evolution.
</p>

<p>
	The culture has shifted up since 2008. The Overton window has shifted. People get more liberal as society evolves -- even despite MAGA. Conservatives are usually fighting a losing battle. Every liberal president who is elected pushes the envelop forward a bit. Which is why progressives need to calm the fuck down and be patient. It's not going to happen overnight.
</p>

<p>
	8 years of Biden/Kamala will move us considerably forward even if they are neoliberals.

			This reminds me. . . In one of your videos, you talked about how a mind contracted in a small map cannot zoom out to see the large map. Yet a mind that can see the large map can zoom into smaller maps within the large map. Yet it's often not enjoyable and they might not get all the details right.
		</p>

		<p>
			An example would be how Deepak Chopra sees a meta view of how science, energetics, mysticism etc are all inter-connected. Yet when he zooms into just science, sometimes he mis-speaks about scientific details. In the bigger picture, it doesn't really matter, yet at a zoomed in view and pure Orange scientist would be more precise. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Would you say the same applies here? That Spira has a meta view and can understand Harris' opinion, yet Spira would probably get some details wrong In contrast, Harris is not able to zoom out and see a meta view. 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It is true that there are tradeoffs between a zoom in vs a zoomed out view.
</p>

<p>
	And yes, a scientist would have more technical details. But the scientist would still be wrong and limited in many ways. He wouldn't just be missing spiritual stuff, his science would be hindered too!
</p>

<p>
	In the case of Sam Harris he is simply wrong. He's got nothing over Spira. Spira's mind is superior, and if Spira decided to put it to use in some technical field he would do well and be more innovative thanks to his superior mental flexibility.
</p>

<p>
	Sam's mind is paradigm locked.

	Biden knocking it out of the park so far.
</p>

<p>
	Let's see how long it holds.
</p>

<p>
	I think many progressive naysayers will be shown wrong by Biden. He will be better than Obama I think. But of course they will still whine that he's not doing enough.
</p>

<p>
	Progressive have been way too harsh on Biden.

</p>

<p>
	It baffles the mind, but it is the case that even enlightened people can be fools.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment does not guarantee that you will use your mind properly. In fact, if your path toward enlightenment places a strong emphases on shutting off the mind, then it's very likely you will use your mind improperly post-enlightenment because you didn't bother to clean it up and develop it.
</p>

<p>
	Development of the mind is important -- despite what the Buddhists would have you believe. Merely shutting off the mind is not going to solve mankind's problems and it is not scalable to society at large.
</p>

<p>
	You must learn to shut off your mind, AND you must learn to use your mind well when it's called for. And you must learn when to do which. This is the way.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	You could just be like, "Hey, I'm going to Vegas for the weekend. Who will wing me?" and you'd find at least a few guys. I found some good wings that way.

<p>
	Yes, it's still good to think things through. It's a way of organizing and spotting problems in your worldview.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening alone will not get rid of the worldview problem. You will still have a mind with a worldview and that worldview could be really bad. Like you could be some kind of MAGA supporter.
</p>

<p>
	Awakening is one thing.
</p>

<p>
	Cleaning up the mind is a separate thing and it is important. There's a bunch of shit in your mind and it lacks coherence.
</p>

<p>
	It's also hard to awaken unless you're deeply questioning all aspects of reality.

<p>
	Your time and energy is limited. You can only field test a tiny percentage of everything. You can figure many things out through contemplation and save yourself time and painful mistakes.
</p>

<p>
	To act without contemplation is to be an animal.

<title>Rupert Spira on Sam Harris Podcast</title>

<p>
	To create a false equivalency between Harris and Spira.
</p>

<p>
	They live in two different ballparks.
</p>

<p>
	Spira understands Harris' position. Harris does not understand Spira's.
</p>

<p>
	The key is to be in a position that understands all positions.
</p>

<p>
	Of course debating nonduality is pointless. But an unawakened person can't help debate this stuff endlessly. Spira isn't there to debate Harris. Spira is just using Harris' audience to spread nonduality. Meanwhile Harris thinks he is out-logicking Spira.

<p>
	If someone serious wants to do the work to create chapters for the videos, we can do a Mega-Thread where you will post the chapter titles and timestamps here on the forum and I will then add them to the videos.
</p>

<p>
	But I will only add them if they are consistently good and accurate. Creating good chapter titles takes some brains. And my time is limited so I would be adding them slowly. I won't be titling dozens of videos per week.
</p>

<p>
	It mostly makes sense for the newer videos.

<p>
	None of those terms do the truth justice.
</p>

<p>
	The best way to put it is: It's God!
</p>

<p>
	Stop using those philosophy terms and just say GOD.
</p>

<p>
	Reality is God. The end.
</p>

<p>
	Now all that's left is for you to awaken to what is God?

	To awaken!
</p>

<p>
	Can't awaken unless you're asleep.
</p>

<p>
	And you can easily doubt it. Philosophers have been doubting reality since the beginning. It's just that people are too preoccupied with survival to want to question and discover the Truth. So God leaves such people alone.
</p>

<p>
	God won't force itself on you. You have to want it.

<p>
	There are no extra layers when you are in Absolute God Consciousness. Evolution is a relative thing within the dream. There is no evolution if you wake up deep enough. We were speaking about within the dream.
</p>

<p>
	The things we are talking about are too multidimensional to put into words. All wording of it is highly oversimplified, which is why you find gaps in the words and they never satisfy or fully make sense. Because they can't fully make sense of an infinite thing.

</blockquote>

<p>
	God is imagining millions of years of evolution in order to paint a convincing dream.
</p>

<p>
	This dream you're dreaming would not feel "real" unless everything had a backstory.
</p>

<p>
	It is unacceptable to you to just say that you always existed. You need to invent the backstory that you were born. And so with every object inside the dream. You keep asking where every object inside the dream came from in order to distract yourself from realizing you are dreaming. Each backstory you tell yourself creates a false ground for your "reality". The more backstories you tell yourself, the deeper they go, the more convinced you become that your dream is real.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever object exists within "the world" -- God must imagine an infinite chain of causation that explains its existence.
</p>

<p>
	The story of every object stretches infinitely far in all directions and all dimensions, thus allowing it to exist here and now.
</p>

<p>
	God is a mind that spins an infinite story. So if you see a civil society existing on some planet, there must be an infinite story to explain how it got there.
</p>

<p>
	But how was civil society created?

<p>
	The answer to that question IS all of human history.

<p>
	God has to bootstrap itself. History is that process.

<p>
	You have to be flexible.
</p>

<p>
	Intention is good, but don't force it on the trip. Let the trip show you want you need to know. Eventually your intentions will kick in. Just not necessarily on that 1 trip.
</p>

<p>
	Dozens of trips are necessary.

	Sam Harris is not awake. And of course he cannot admit this to his audience as it would discredit and embarrass him and shake their materialist, rationalist worldview. So he plays these games and fools him audience along with him. They have no clue how wrong his epistemology and metaphysics is.

<p>
	And our point is that Sam is God.
</p>

<p>
	Lol
</p>

<p>
	The mistake Sam is making is that he's actually KNOWING that we cannot know. This is not not-knowing, this is knowing. And false knowing at that. If he truly didn't know he would be open to the idea that he could definitively know that materialism is false. But he believes this to be impossible, which is just a lack of imagination on his part.
</p>

<p>
	Sam confuses his inability to imagine how one could know whether idealism or materialism is true with the actual ability to do so. Just because he can't imagine it, doesn't mean it cannot be done. Classic epistemic mistake.
</p>

<p>
	Plenty of people develop no-mind but are still dogmatic.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that an empty mind does not guarantee that when your mind starts turning it doesn't turn out shit.
</p>

<p>
	Emptying your goldfish's bowl does not guarantee him what he really needs, which is clean water.
</p>

<p>
	The opposite of dirty water is not no water, it is clean water.

<p>
	Anything becomes a dogma if you are dogmatic about it.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is not the thing itself but how your mind holds it. And a dogmatic mind will hold all things dogmatically, be it science or religion or spirituality or even nonduality or love. And even -- drum roll.... -- being nondogmatic.
</p>

<p>
	In a delicious irony, the dogmatic mind will turn being nondogmatic into a dogma!
</p>

			Make it more innocent and cute how without getting into the friend zone?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	You can be cute and romantical without being sexual.
</p>

<p>
	Here are two better things you could have texted her:
</p>

<p>
	"You are more adorable than a baby polar bear sliding down a rainbow." (stolen line from Jeffy, but it shows you my point).
</p>

<p>
	"I want to build you a house out of Legos and fill it with exotic baby animals."
</p>

<p>
	Neither of these lines is sexual, but they both clearly tell the girl that you are interested in her romantically and so there will be no friendzone from this.
</p>

<p>
	Friendzone happens when you don't make your intent clear. Besides, this is only the opening shot of the battle. There will be many more lines following it which will also subtly communicate your romantic intent. For example, you can literally tell her something like, "I'm taking you for a picnic in the romantical land of enchanted unicorns. Watch out for the rattlesnakes hiding in the pink mist." If she responds positively to such a text, you know she's interested in fucking you. Your intent is clear and you never come off creepy. If she doesn't respond positively then you know she's not attracted to you and nothing you text her will change that.
</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	That's why I commented. To disabuse you of this time-wasting notion.
</p>

<p>
	You can certainly turn a woman on via texts. I can and have given girls more powerful orgasms via text than past guys ever did with their dicks. But this assumes the girl is attracted to begin with. A very important distinction to learn.
</p>

<p>
	My general rule of thumb is this: avoid explicitly mentioning sex to a girl until you've had sex with her. If you follow this one rule you will save so many blown up sets.
</p>

<p>
	Of course you can be much more edgy and still get the girl. But you needlessly risk blowing it up. Why take that risk? Just to be edgy?
</p>

<p>
	Once you reach the attraction hook-point with a girl, you can get away with some really edgy and sexual stuff. And the hook-point is usually reached within 5 minutes of meeting her face-to-face. But you are not reaching that hook-point via your texts.
</p>

<p>
	If you reach the hook-point, you can politely ask to squeeze a girl's tits, and there's a good chance she will let you. One of the most amazing experiences in game is when you go to the club, hit hook-point within 5 seconds just by looking her in the eyes and smiling, and then politely asking her if you can fondle her tits in front of all her friends, and she giggles and says Yes.
</p>

<p>
	This sort of thing is possible, but it requires really good calibration and understanding of when hook-point has been hit. Hook-point is like the most important thing to getting girls. It's so crucial to be able to recognize. And it's not a function of time because it can happen in 5 seconds with no words exchanged.
</p>

<p>
	When flashy and ballsy game works, it's because the guy reached rapid hook-point with the girl. But foolish newbies think they can do that on a cold girl and it blows up in their face.
</p>

<p>
	When a girl likes you, she will let you get away with murder. But if she has no investment in you at all, you might as well be romancing a brick wall. Don't waste your time romancing brick walls. Look for girls who love you right off the bat. Then sleeping with them will be easy.
</p>

<p>
	The most effective way to get laid is to go to a nightclub, approach every girl and screen immediately for hook-point. Once you find the one that hooks, you immediately screen her for logistics. If the logistics are not optimal, you immediately move on to another girl until you find one that hooks hard and has optimal logistics. Then you pull. Guys who are masters of game have boiled their game down to this. They are very wise to not waste their time.
</p>

	I could only stand to listen until 2:57, at which point Sam revealed the crux of his materialist delusion.
</p>

<p>
	The duality between mind and brain is one of the biggest delusions in this work. If you insist on believing that duality, you're fucked. You will never realize God.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No doubt it works.
</p>

<p>
	Because it takes a stranger time to warm up to you. By talking casually about yourself you put them at ease amd give them something in the conversation to think about and latch onto.
</p>

<p>
	If they hear something interesting they will want to ask questions, and soon a deep conversation forms.
</p>

<p>
	This is a good skill to practice on the airplane when you fly. Make it a goal to start a convo that lasts the entire flight long. It's doable. I've done it. It's also much more fun than sitting their like a cold zombie.
</p>

<p>
	What's the best way to start a deep convo on a plane? Just start talking about yourself like the persona already knows you.
</p>

<p>
	"So when we land I'm going to get a burger and a coffee. And tomorrow I'm going fishing...."
</p>

<p>
	Bottom line: if you want to be a master of starting conversations you must lead them. You must do the initial heavy lifting.
