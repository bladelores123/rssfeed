<p>
	When I take my stack, it is certainly no mere placedo. It's VERY noticable. Modafinil is especially very noticable.
</p>

<p>
	Armodafinil is nuts for me.
</p>

<p>
	And sulbutiamine seems to be the second most noticable for me.
</p>

<p>
	It can be hard to notice each supplement in isolation but easier when they are stacked and synergize.
</p>

<p>
	Join Toastmasters and/or practice talking out loud to yourself in the car, at home, in the shower.
</p>

<p>
	Also, talking to a camera really helps. Just set up your smart phone on a tripod, hit record, and talk. Do this every day and you will improve rapidly.
</p>

<p>
	Talk about whatever you are most passionate about and have lots of experience with. For example, if you love techno music, talk about that.
</p>

<p>
	Depression is an egoic reaction. It's normal and to be expected. But go beyond it. Go deeper.

	This is an unemprical and highly subjective claim. An epistemic assumption and dogma.

	Question it.

<p>

<p>
	Of course don't ONLY do that exercise for the rest of your life, but you could doing it for a couple months and then switch it up.

<p>
	You gotta experiment to see which exercises jive with you.

<p>
	That's just ego backlash/resistance.
</p>

<p>
	If you're doing a lot of personal dev then you should expect to feel WORSE not better. This is like lifting heavy weights at the gym. Muscle soreness is not bad, it's sorta the point.
</p>

<p>
	Big change is emotionally taxing.
</p>

<p>
	You must learn to console yourself in times of stress and upheaval.
</p>

<p>
	But also, don't be spending all day doing personal dev. Schedule some time for R&R and fun. Your schedule needs to be sustainable in the long run.
</p>

<p>
	Your two groups are a rather arbitrary dichotomy. The self-help industrry is gigantic and draws in all sorts, young to old, suffering to ambitious, depressed to happy, losers to successful.
</p>

<p>
	There's not a single person wouldn't benefit from some form of self help. Your entry point will vary: a bad relationship, desire for more money, desire to calm your emotions, desire to be more confident, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Hell, you could study this stuff purely for intellectual curiosity, as I like to do.

Plan things out strategically.
</p>

<p>
	Life purpose is a very long-term project. It will take you at least 5 years to seriously actualize it. So while you're chipping away at that, you should of course also work on other areas of your life like developing dating skills.
</p>

<p>
	You can work on your life purpose most of the week, but then Friday & Saturday nights you can focus on dating. This will actually rejuvenate you for next week's work.
</p>

<p>
	Counter-intuitively you can sometimes accomplish more work when you have good outlets for rejuvenation & socialization.

</p>

<p>
	There are times in your life when you will need to focus on your LP 100% to the exclusion of everything else. But then there are times when that's not efficient, where you don't have that much work to do on your LP, which frees up time for other things. And sometimes you will need to put your LP on the backburner for a while (into maintenance mode) while you work on your relationships, family, house, health, etc.
</p>

<p>
	At your current stage in life you probably don't need to be spending 8 hours a day on your LP.

	As soon as you try to articulate or conceptualize it, it slips through your fingers.

<p>
	This is what makes enlightenment work so tricky. You have to be able to grok that which cannot be grokked. I call this hyper-intuition. You start to understand reality transcendentally, non-symbolically.

</p>

<p>
	Zero sound is pure empty consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Zero sight is pure empty consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Zero feel is pure empty consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	To become aware of this Groundless Ground is enlightenment. It's remarkable when you realize that ALL sensation have always occurred within the Groundless Ground. It will be so obvious that you won't understand why you never "saw" this Nothingness before. It was there the whole time! It is you! It is God!
</p>

<p>
	Look closely at your actual hand. That is Nothingness!
</p>

<p>
	Nothingness is NOT an idea. Nothingness is actuality itself.

<p>
	Yes, that is the catch-22 of social development: low consciousness crowds tend to elect low consciousness leaders, and low consciousness leaders tend to empower low consciousness crowds.
</p>

<p>
	The entire society must therefore go through the struggle of fighting it out. The fighting it out IS the ACTUAL process of growth & evolution. Growth and evolution are sometimes bloody and ugly. Peace leads to war, and war leads to peace, and on and on it goes. That's the duality inherent within nonduality.
</p>

<p>
	Every country, and every human being is going through this struggle to various degrees. It's just since Brazil isn't as mature as America or Europe, its growing pains will be more acute.

<p>
	Just to be safe, you can cut a blotter square into 4ths and consume one fourth just to test it. That should be about 20-30ug, which is a very mild dose. You won't trip balls on that amount, but you'll def feel it.
</p>

<p>
	After that test run, you can have much more confidence consuming a full square.
</p>

<p>
	Never rush to high dosages. Be patient and take your time with it. You will be rewarded for your carefulness.

<p>
	Thing is, you can't just upgrade an entire nation by electing one good guy. That never works. What's necessary is to upgrade the systems, the infrastructure, the culture, the average people.
</p>

<p>
	Low consciousness people cannot appreciate a high consciousness leader (if Lula can even be called that -- I can't speak to what crimes is did or did not commit).
</p>

<p>
	Brazil is very Blue still and it will take a lot of work to transition it to pure Orange, let alone Green. Even America is failing to embrace Green. Brazil will not be Green in our lifetimes. But Orange is possible.

<p>
	It's not shallow reasons. Being successful opens a lot of doors. Then love comes. It's not like the girls falls in love with your money. You can lure her in with your success, but then make her fall in love with your personality.
</p>

<p>
	Most girls are not the golddigger types. A few are, but most aren't. If you're intelligent you can use this to your advantage. Become successful, access the hottest girls, and then pick one and make her fall in love with you rather than your money or success.
</p>

<p>
	The best thing about success is that it can buy you access to lots of people, which then gets you a lot of eyeballs, which makes attracting females a lot easier than being just another guy at the club.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, there are pros and cons to each personality style and mating strategy. Nerds have ways of getting laid. Jocks have ways of getting laid. Etc. The only people who don't get laid are those who sit at home complaining on online forums.
</p>

<p>
	There is just 1 tricking to finding girls: GO OUT & BE SOCIAL! That's it! Everything else is minutia.
</p>

<p>
	I don't care who you are or what you look like, if you go out long enough you will attract a girl.
</p>

<p>

			That sounds a bit harsh to me. Hinduism is not about believing something, but about seeking. So non-duality is in essence something that has to be questioned and discussed over and over again, like the Indians did.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	No, this a common misunderstanding.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing to discuss about nonduality. Nonduality is perfectly clear and perfectly documented.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing to do with nonduality is to practice it. Anything else is the ego distracting from the work.
</p>

<p>
	Debating God does not help anyone. It's perfectly clear what God is. The only question is: will you do the practices necessary to realize it?
</p>

<p>
	That you are God is not up for debate or discussion. Look and you will see that it's true. Of course most egos don't want to look. Which is why they resort to all kinds of devilry instead.
</p>

<p>
	This is why Zen practice is very austere and brutal. There is no room in Zen for debate. A Zen master would never allow debate in his zendo. Smartasses who try to debate a Zen master will get a punch in the face.
</p>

<p>
	The proof is in the practice and nowhere else. If you want to ask questions about how to improve your practice, that is welcome and good. Stick to that. I love reading and answering those types of questions.
</p>

<p>
	But starting threads about how Leo is full of shit, or how enlightenment is fake, or how you are not God -- that's just bullshit.

</p>

<p>
	If someone tells me "You are not God", they are straight up ignorant of nonduality. Case closed. I'm not gonna entertain their delusions any further.
</p>

<p>
	Being openminded does not mean that I'm tolerant of bullshit. Just the opposite. A deep understanding of nonduality makes it extremely obvious to spot who's full of shit and who hasn't reached the deepest levels yet.
</p>

<p>
	Egoless was promoting a dualistic Christian version of a separate God. Which is pure devilry.
</p>

<p>
	It's obvious these people have not even bothered to do the basic research, to read the books, let alone to have direct experiences of the advanced and subtle things being discussed here.
</p>

<p>
	But these devils don't just stop there. Then what they do is they use the PM system to corrupt the minds of other members behind the scenes, out of sight -- trying to recruit them to their narrow-minded ideology, slowly sowing seeds of doubt and controversy.
</p>

<p>
	It's devilry plain and simple. And I'm not gonna sit by and watch it unfold. Devils who come here trying to run their tricks will get slapped across the face.
</p>

<p>
	If you want a forum where devils run free, there are thousands of such forums available across the web that you can join. The purpose of moderation is not to censor free speech, but to weed the forum of low-quality members. It only takes a small handful of low-quality members to turn a forum into a cesspool. Because it's the low-quality members who tend to be the most devilish, the most arrogant, the biggest know-it-alls, the biggest bullshitters.

	Many people on this forum are not mature enough to handle serious discussions about politics or government. It just turns into an ego battle. Many political threads end up getting locked.

<p>
	Intelligent nerdy guys can earn lots of money and buy their way into a girl's heart.
</p>

<p>
	It's a classic mating strategy.
</p>

<p>
	Look at Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, etc. They seem to have no problem finding a wife.
</p>

<p>
	If you're so smart, use your smarts to get the girl.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, there are many girls out there who LOVE intelligent, nerdy guys. Just don't be a creeper!
</p>

<p>
	The thing girls hate most is creepers, not nerds. Nerds are the hip thing nowadays. Creepers will always be uncool.
</p>

<p>
	Girls who love intelligent guys are my fave type of girl! For selfish reasons <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

Girls get far more emotionally attached to guys, all else being equal. Your perspective is way self-centered on this issue.
</p>

<p>
	Girls get so attached to guys that they will stay with the guy even if he beats her and treats her like shit. This is a very serious problem for women.
</p>

<p>
	Also, not all girls are socialites with 100s of friends. Tons of introverted girls out there. And finding a good guy is not easy. Not every random dick will do.

<p>
	There is no crisis. Just stop bullshitting and keyboard-jockeying. That's all.
</p>

<p>
	You are free to discuss any personal development related topic on this forum as long as you do so intelligently, without having some sort of ideological or egoic agenda.
</p>

<p>
	Just be chill, normal, and don't start hysterics, fear-mongering, or preaching. And don't talk with authority about nonduality unless you have lots of direct experience. And even then, speak lightly.
</p>

<p>
	People who start claiming nonsense like, "You are not God" will be banned. There is not going to be any discussion tolerated on this matter because it is pure ignorance spoken by a devilish ego.
</p>

<p>
	Enough gossip and fake controversy.
</p>

<p>
	Go do the work.
</p>

<p>
	There are people who join here who are not interested in learning, but preaching their ideas. People who I determine are here without a genuine desire to learn, will be banned.
</p>

<p>
	It's not hard to see people on here who are consistent BSers, and also do not understand nonduality, yet keep acting as though they do.
</p>

<p>
	Don't come here to teach me or others nonduality. Be here to learn and have an open mind.
</p>

<p>
	If anything, I am way too lax with moderation on this forum. Most people should rightly be banned for spouting their arrogant nonsense under the present of spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Egoless and Source_Mystic were acting like devils. And for this they have been banned.

<p>
	Rights are conceptual creations of the mind. Take a look at what a right is.
</p>

<p>
	Your rights are whatever you imagine them to be and whoever else you succeed in convincing to imagine them with you.

That's called a state of profound not-knowing.
</p>

<p>
	In the absolute sense, no knowledge is possible.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment is the realization that nothing can be known. Knowing collapses into simple but mysterious, profound, infinite being.
</p>

<p>
	This is not only correct, it is the ultimate Truth.
</p>

<p>
	But there is still deeper to go. Don't stop just there. This is still just the tip of the iceberg of not-knowing.
</p>

<p>
	Also, don't be surprised it this state of not-knowing fades as the ego reasserts itself. Try to keep the not-knowing going as long as possible. Don't resist it. Notice that it is peaceful and nice.
</p>

<p>
	You have not really hit rock bottom. Rock bottom is MUCH deeper. But you're on the right track <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

	For me it's mostly an avoidance of doing more trips and some turning back towards media, Youtube, TV, video games, books, theory, etc.

You could certainly take it much more than that. It just depends on how deep you want to go, how fast.
</p>

<p>
	It's hard to say how my consciousness it different. I just have a very deep understanding of what reality is and I'm semi-lucid of the Absolute if I just sit still and ponder it. God is shining all the time, there is nothing but God, but it takes me focusing my attention on it to recognize it.

</p>

<p>
	In the future, I will be banning more people who keep talking shit about things they do not have direct experience of.
</p>

<p>
	This forum is not a zone to spout off all manner of falsehood under the banner of free speech. This kind of devilry will not fly here.
</p>

<p>
	If you don't agree, tough titty, find yourself some other corner of the web to shout your BS to.
</p>

<p>
	People who keep spreading JP's BS will also be banned. I expect better of you guys.

<p>
	Your ego is over-exaggerating. No man goes to prision for accidentally bumping his hand into a woman's ass. Your mind is cherry picking this stuff to create a victim mythology for yourself.
</p>

<p>
	You are still stuck in Orange so Green is over your head.
</p>

<p>
	Like I said, you will precieve equality as disempowerment. Power is being taken away from you to equalize the playing field. The solution is to stop clinging to power and stop acting aggrieved.
</p>

<p>
	If you actually cared about equality you would willingly acknowledge the systemic inequalities which exist for women and minorities. But that would put you at Green, which you still aren't developed enough for.

<p>
	You guys are still not getting Green. You are looking at Green from Orange and failing to understand.
</p>

<p>
	You must step outside your perspective.
</p>

<p>
	Feminists are not fighting for women's rights over men's rights. They are fighting for equal rights.
</p>

<p>
	The men's rights movement is not about equality, it's a reaction against equality.
</p>

<p>
	Equality for an overpowered group looks like loss of power. Beause it is. Equality means men lose power. Just like equality means the tyrant loses power. Of course the tyrant will feel this is unfair and bad. Tough shit.
</p>

<p>
	The most frequently I took it was about 5 days in a row. Other than that stint, I took it quite rarely, with many months in between.
</p>

<p>
	What results?
</p>

<p>
	I apprehended the ultimate nature of God & existence.
</p>

<p>
	Permanent enlightenment, no. But my consciousness is different than it was.
</p>

<p>
	5-MeO is too powerful to take regularly. It requires lots of integration. Not sure what would happen it one took it for 30 days straight. Probably some massive shift in consciousness, and lots of ego backlash as your entire reality and life collapsed into God-consciousness.

	ACIM is not about believing things. It's about doing practices which ground you in direct experience.
</p>

<p>
	The biggest obstacle to realzing God is beliefs about God.

<p>
	I would sit up straight, be still, and keep your eyes open, in a well-lit room. You will gain more than eyes closed in bed. You don't want a trip to turn into a dream. You want it to mimick real life.

<p>

<p>
	Before you guys go on trying exotic psychedelics, build a solid foundation with classic psychedelics like LSD, mushrooms, 2C-B, and DMT. That's where 90% of your results will come from. They are classics for a reason: they are solid and safe (when used responsibly).

</p>

<p>
	Did they import it from the North?

<p>
	Of course they would.

<p>
	Which is why we need to quickly indoctrinate them with religion or science before that can happen.

			When Leo says to think of my parents when they aren’t in the room, and then says to realize that it is a concept and imagination. What is that “concept and imagination” ? Wouldn’t that just be more actuality? Aren’t those thoughts just as much truth as anything else since they aren’t coming from anywhere?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, imagination is of course actual. But there is an important difference as the following analogy illustrates:
</p>

<p>
	A photograph of a cheeseburger is a real thing, but it is not a cheeseburger and you cannot eat it.
</p>

<p>
	The problem is that many people (including you) have convinced themselves that photographs of cheeseburgers are actual cheeseburgers.
</p>

<p>
	And now you are saying, "But Leo!!! Aren't photographs real?"
</p>

<p>
	Yes they are! But that isn't the issue. The issue is, you have confused photographs with cheeseburgers.
</p>

	You are always welcome to prove me wrong by making something of yourself.

<p>
	I call you lazy to goad you into action. It's the digital equivalent of throwing a cup of cold water in your face.
</p>

<p>
	Buddhists call this "skillful means".

<p>
	It's an act, done tongue-in-cheek. Don't take it too seriously.
</p>

<p>
	I play around to keep myself entertained. What else is there to do? Lecture dead seriously? How boring!
</p>

<p>
	One of the most important aspects of this work is to be playful and unpredicatable.
</p>

<p>
	Life is a stage and you are an actor whether you realize it or not. Act consciously.

</p>

<p>
	I said to forget yoga because you get lost chasing fantasies of what yoga is.
</p>

<p>
	Yoga is looking at your hand.
</p>

<p>
	But with all that said, if you have a yoga practice do not stop it. What I said was for the purposes of that video.

	It's not gonna do much by itself. It is a powerful catalyst for other psychedelics. But be very careful with it. It's easy to x10-x20 your dose and you must observe proper diet and never do it with certain substances like 5-MeO or it could kill you.

<p>
	Sales can occur at any stage of the Spiral. If your sales is manipulative, that's because the stage you are at is manipulative.
</p>

<p>
	Who you are colors everything you do, from sex, to spirituality, to entertainment, to sales.
</p>

<p>
	Orange people have no problem with sleazy used car salesmen tactics, just like stage Red people have no problem taking a baseball bat to your knee caps.
