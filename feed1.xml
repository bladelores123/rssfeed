</p>

<p>
	As I already said, ego is a contracted state of consciousness. Changing the state makes it go away.

<p>
	Zen is a formal religion with various titles and so forth, just like any religion has.
</p>

<p>
	A certification is only as valid as you imagine it to be.

<title>Leo, How does one Surrender to Death?</title>

<p>
	Yes!
</p>

<p>
	I think you are framing this whole issue in an unresourceful way. Rather than thinking of it as "My death is coming", forget about that and just focus on being really CURIOUS! Be so curious about what consciousness is that death becomes irrelevant.
</p>

<p>
	Who cares about death when there is God to explore? Frame it in this positive way. When tripping, replace fear with curiosity.
</p>

<p>
	Don't overthink it. It's certainly not done through logic. Logic is there to serve survival.
</p>

<p>
	For me it just comes naturally as a means to my ultimate goal: Truth, Love, and understanding.
</p>

<p>
	If you just desire Truth, and Love, and understanding enough, and work towards that, eventually ego-death will happen and it won't be a big deal.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics help a lot with getting confortable with ego death. That is one of their most useful features. You can become so comfortable with it that you don't bat an eye when it happens.
</p>

<p>
	Otherwise try years of Kriya yoga.
</p>

<title>Leo's latest video : It feels frustrating</title>

<p>
	Simple: just do the practices.
</p>

<p>
	You are right, that video cannot be understood at your present level of consciousness. Like I said, it took me some 15 years to get there. And I used some powerful tools along the way without which it would have been impossible for me.
</p>

<p>
	Basically almost no human being is capable of understanding it. Because it is requires transhuman levels of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Getting to the bottom of What is reality? is a HUGE undertaking. You are asking to know how the world is created. This cannot be understood from within the human mind.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it is very frustrating at times. Psychedelics make it 1000x easier.
</p>

<p>
	Systems rarely just collapse, they tend to evolve into more conscious systems.
</p>

<p>
	There are schooling styles which mix learning with play. They just aren't widely adopted because we have a factory farm education system right now. But that will change.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	A) I don't know what you mean by that. You are painting with a broad brush here. People experience and realize different things.
</p>

<p>
	Nondual consciousness is not a state of ego, it is the absence of ego, and the realization that your true nature is nothing and everything, or infinite, or God.
</p>

<p>
	There are many people here who are unaware of many things. Just because they have some degree of realization does not mean they are aware of the deeper layers.
</p>

<p>
	Ego dissolution also has layers and degrees of depth to it. The ego is a complex and relentless structure. It takes a lot of deconstruction work to fully get beyond it.
</p>

<p>
	B) Do not start yet another nonduality debate.
</p>

<p>
	The point is, all that is relative.
</p>

<p>
	They are "terrorists" to YOU because you got a survival agenda. To themselves they are not terrorists, they are defenders of their way of life.
</p>

<p>
	In every case a human is simply defending his way of life.
</p>

<p>
	Israel's system is not to kill but to carve out a homeland for themsleves, yes. Killing is a byproduct of that.
</p>

<p>
	I do not support what Israel is doing, but that's my agenda.

<p>
	It's not that things are designed to be destroyed, it's that reality is designed to maximize diversity and beauty. Which requires that no one form monopolize the entire playing field.

	Imaigne if the planet was only populated by one animal type. That would be a terrible design.

<p>
	This is an extremely problematic & relativistic criteria.
</p>

<p>
	It's virtually impossible for a political leader to take any action which does not prioritize the survival agenda of one group of people over another. This is why politics is so challenging. There are no actions which are 100% favorable to everyone's survival agenda. Government has to balance between various agendas.

		<p>
			I've generally avoided commenting on this topic, and perhaps it's unwise of me to wade in, but fools go where angels fear to tread <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />, and perhaps something productive will come of it. It's a mark of my respect for this forum as a gathering place for sincere seekers of truth that I am bothering to discuss this. We all know how unproductive such discussions can get.
		</p>

		<p>
			Anyhow, I respect psychedelics, and have taken them a few times, though I'm no expert. I certainly believe they can be helpful -- for the right person -- in opening the mind up in certain ways.
		</p>

		<p>
			However, from where I stand, the problem with believing that psychedelics can take you to Truth is that it misunderstands what Truth is.
		</p>

		<p>
			Truth is not a place to which one can be taken. It is not a state of consciousness, no matter how amazing, mind-blowing, or infinite. It is not a samadhi, no matter how extraordinary.  Nor can any samadhi, no matter how profound, result in the realization of Truth.
		</p>

		<p>
			These -- at best -- can be glimpses or intimations or partial awakenings, but never Truth itself.
		</p>

		<p>
			Not even with integration and embodiment. Actually, Truth <em>cannot</em> be integrated and embodied. To realize Truth is to understand why that's so.
		</p>

		<p>
			The realization of Truth -- and there is only one such thing, and in fact not even that -- is fundamentally the destruction of certain incoherent unconscious beliefs which are at the root of suffering. These beliefs are based in thinking, that is, in words. These beliefs can only be unraveled  through a clear introspective investigation of them.
		</p>

		<p>
			That investigation happens through intellectual discernment, not through any particular experience. Words destroy words, logic destroys logic, thinking destroys thinking. No quantity or type of experience can do it, because what is investigated is something common to all experiences. It's a belief that has to be unraveled through examination of experience itself.
		</p>

		<p>
			So it can have nothing to do with any particular experience, however cosmic, nor can it be the result of such a thing. If it did, it would then become provisional -- temporary -- limited -- and that would defeat the point of Truth.
		</p>

		<p>
			Truth is effortless perfect peace eternally. If that isn't the case, it can't be called Truth.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Nice story bro, but Truth is everything and the only thing.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can certainly take one there. Of course here and there are nowhere and one and the same.
</p>

<p>
	Truth is both temprary and eternal. It is all and nothing.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing but states of consciousness and you are in a state right now, regardless of what it is. All states are part of the Truth. Whether it is formed or formless is irrelvant.
</p>

<p>
	These nonduality debates are getting really silly.
</p>

<p>
	This is just false.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics are not merely "an experience", they can take you to the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Just because enlightenment may not require an experience shift does not entail that an experience shift cannot lead to an enlightenment. Psychedelics do not merely change one's experience, they radically elevate one's degree of consciousness -- which is the whole key to this work. Psychedelics put you into an instantaneous samadhi state. From this state one can contemplate and realize all sorts of things, including one's true nature or various facets of the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	The reason you're making this mistake is that you're trying to understand psychedelics in terms of some traditional spiritual paradigm like Buddhism, Zen, or Vedanta, which tend to discount state changes -- but psychedelics are a totally different path so it is inappropriate to judge it from those other paradigms.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics can take you to levels of understanding and awakening which are simply impossible otherwise, or else possible but extremely rare and only for exceptionally gifted practitioners.
</p>

<p>
	It is correct that you will not be able to permanently lock in a psychedelic peak state 24/7. But that is an improper expectation to begin with.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics, when used properly, can absolutely take you to the highest, most Absolute Truth. Of course the real trick is integrating it and embodying, which requires a lot of additional work.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelic insights and realizations square up perfectly with those of Buddhism, Zen, Vedanta, yoga, Christianity, Islam, and any other serious mystical tradition.
</p>

<p>
	Shunyata, Brahman, The Self, no-self, ego-death, Allah, God, nonduality, Shiva, Buddha, nirvana, rigpa, samadhi, Mu, Infinity, The Void, Nothingness, The Dharmakaya, the godhead, union, Absolute Consciousness, satchitanadna, Truth, Love, kundalini awakening, Nibbana, formlessness, etc. -- all of this and more you can realize on psychedelics.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The stuff they did was unbelievable.
</p>

<p>
	They planned several assassination attempts of government officials.
</p>

<p>
	Of course I don't believe Osho was personally aware of these criminal plans, but nevertheless he was responsible for running that community and he should have understood the dangers of having his commune spiral out of hand.
</p>

<p>
	It should have been obvious to him that Sheela was a devil.

<title>a clarification of 'imagination'?</title>

Look at it. Your hand is imaginary.
</p>

<p>
	Ditto for every other physical object, including the room and all the stuff in it.
</p>

<p>
	This goes way deeper than you can presently believe.
</p>

<p>
	If you stopped imagining entirely, the whole world would disappear. But of course this is not within your ego's power to do.
</p>

<p>
	Just because something is imagination does not mean your ego has the power to control it according to its whims. This is where people get tripped up. They imagine that if something is imaginary their ego can manipulate at will, and when they fail to do so they conclude, "Well, then it must not be imaginary." That is the key mistake.

<p>
	Yes, that is what all spiritual practice is ultimately about.
</p>

<p>
	The fastest and easiest way is to take psychedelics. They will gently guide you into death and you will learn to love it.

<p>
	Or do whatever other spiritual practice you like.

When its needs are not met, or it seriously threatened, it reacts in a knee-jerk manner with heavy negative emotions like fear, anger, and judgment to defend its survival.
</p>

<p>
	The ego being afraid to die goes even deeper than that.
</p>

<p>
	Think of putting a loaded gun to your head and pulling the trigger. That is ego being afraid to die. Now try to imagine what it would take not to be afraid of that and not to resist it.

			Thanks, sounds plausible. Certainly God, being God , has the power to chose otherwise, than only to maximize love?  And for all i know, God is maximizing pleasure at a particular locus, drawing vampirically from the environment around it.... all while cleverly disguising this as a Maximization of Love.  Certainly God is Infinite Cleverness as well?  If so, then it can probably disguise anything as anything else, without you or I ever becoming aware of it at the human level.

Be careful not to misunderstand me. Imagination is a very complex and sophisticated thing. It does not mean your ego has control over all aspects of life. Just the opposite.

	God loves you so much that it will allow you to imagine your own hell and experience it. God will never take that freedom away from you. God's greatest desire is that you realize the power of your own mind. So you can see how big you are. You cannot realize your bigness if you deny hell. God will never deny anything to you.

<p>
	There is never a comfortable and convenient way of facing death. You will never be "ready" for it. You must face it and deal with whatever arises. It doesn't have to be so difficult.
</p>

<p>
	It's like you're being told to jump into a cold pool and you keep saying, "But maybe I should go do X before I jump in. Maybe I'm not ready for the cold." It' will always be cold. You cannot avoid that.
</p>

<p>
	On my 24 birthday I went skydiving. I had to jump out of a fucking moving airplane at 12,000 ft. How did I do it? I just jumped. It was not pleasant. But I also didn't spend a lot of time thinking about it otherwise it would have been a lot worse.
</p>

<p>
	Jumping out of an airplane is scarier than ego death on a psychedelic.

	But the human ego is not conscious it.

<p>
	Human will is a tiny fraction of God's Infinite Will, which is why you as a human cannot will yourself to be a kangaroo. But you can perform more minor miracles like deciding to eat some pizza.

I would like to interview one of those extrasensory people to know how they developed their opinion on the subject. Have you done such a thing? Have you had any occasion of meeting with an extrasensory person and have him check your body's condition? Are you interested in having this kind of feedback?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The difficulty with that is how are you/they going to distinguish body conditions which were caused by psychedelics vs other things?
</p>

<p>
	I have many conditions which existed long before I did psychedelics. Sorting that out will get very tricky because the extrasensory person will not have intimate knowledge of my biology or life history. For example, I've struggled low energy problems for most of my adult life, a decade before I discovered psychedelics. But an extrasensory person might be tempted to blame it on using psychedelics, which would be a gross error.
</p>

<p>
	In the end no one can know you better than you can know yourself. So if you really want to understand you must run your own experiments, not ask some stranger for answers. Any other you ask for answers is 1 step removed from your own direct experience and hence will always be less credible than your own direct experience.

<p>
	That attitude is not going to cut it. That is an attitude of fear.
</p>

<p>
	You need to have an attitude of: "I want the truth and whatever the truth is, I will love and accept it."
</p>

<p>
	Your attitude must be one of Truth & Love. Love for self, love for others, love for the world. Everything you fear and hate you must learn to love and see the beauty and value of.
</p>

<p>
	Whatever you fear, the psychedelics will definitely make you face it head-on, if not in this trip then in the next. You cannot access God consciousness so long as you have fear of creatures or anything else. First you will have to purify yourself of all fear. Because God is pure Love! You cannot access God's infinite Love so long as there are parts of the universe that you hate or reject.
</p>

<p>
	There is nothing in the universe to hate or fear because the entire universe is yourself. But this requires enormous emotional maturity to embody. This is where the real inner growth happens.
</p>

<p>
	Imagine seeing your worst nightmare and loving it. That is the proper attitude. This is the whole point of all of our work. To become unconditionally loving. It's not easy to do for humans. But then again, that's why you're on this Earth in the first place: to learn to love. Earth is a love simulator.
</p>

<p>
	That's exactly right. I know exactly what you're talking about. That's the ego's natural reaction to going directly for enlightenment. It's terrified of the unknown infinitude. Only natural and totally expected.
</p>

<p>
	The solution is to push through it, face the fear head-on, until you breakthrough to the other side. This can take many attempts.
</p>

<p>
	This is why religions call it "taking the leap of faith". You place your faith in Truth as your highest aim and desire, and blindly leap for it not knowing what will happen. From your POV it feels like you will die. But your love for Truth must be so great that you desire it so much that you are willing to die to have it. And so you do. But in reality what will happen is the ego will collapse and you will land in an infinitely deep pool of the softest down feathers. That is paradise, heaven, nirvana, -- AKA, the Love of God.
</p>

<p>
	But you cannot know this before you take the leap.
</p>

<p>
	Fear of death & insanity is what keeps you from entering the Kingdom of Heaven.
</p>

<p>
	But of course, you must realize, all fear is imaginary. You are like the groundhog terrified of its own shadow.
</p>

<p>
	Psychedelics make ego-death a lot easier.
</p>

<p>
	That is a fair point, IF TRUE. But that's a big IF.
</p>

<p>
	There's a big difference between an extrasensory person actually looking at you after you've consumed psychedelics and telling you that they see something wrong in your body, versus them just making a generic proclamation that all psychedelics are energetically harmful.
</p>

<p>
	The first case is a direct observation of a specific person and situation. The second case is a theoretical abstraction which can come from a biased, closedminded, sloppy, bigoted perspective.
</p>

<p>
	It's the difference between saying: I was once robbed by a black guy versus saying all black guys are thieves. Very important difference!
</p>

<p>
	The essence of bigotry is making overly broad claims about things which one has little to no experience of.
</p>

			3g Syrian rue tea will enhance and prolong the pure DMT when consumed 30 - 45 minutes beforehand. Boil for 5 - 9 minutes then strain and drink. You might want to add generous amount of raw honey or other natural sweetener as it very strong stuff. You can also add extra herbal infusions they use to make (changa) like passionflower, lemon balm, chamomile ect.. for they should potentially enhance/prolong the effect and support the nervous system.
		</p>

		<p>
			A good dose of cacao beforehand should most definitely be a solid potentiator as it has been used with mushrooms by many ancient cultures to enhance and nourish with brain and body with adequate nutrients and chemicals to support an optimal experience. Although i would be wary to combine with syrian rue due so best keep those two separate.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have personally experienced low-dose psychedelic effects from mega dosing cacao alone, also known as "ceremonial dosing" but i would do this alone and not mix with stronger psychedelics. If i wanted to enhance other psychedelics, i would consume anywhere between 7 - 21 grams of raw cacao paste sometime beforehand.
		</p>

		<p>
			One step at a time, start small, find your sweet spots and take note of your nervous system because frequent psychoactive use tends to severely overstimulate it and with an overstimulated central nervous system, its near impossible to be fully present and embody an enlightened awareness until a long break from any form(chemical and or technological) of over-stimulation is provided.

<p>
	Careful folks, consuming Syrian Rue requires being on a special MAOI diet, otherwise it can be physically dangerous.
</p>

<p>
	Also, you can buy pure Harmala extract on Ebay. No need to mess with the Syrian Rue seeds. Harmala is a legal herb.

<p>
	I have not done high doses of LSD. 125ug is plenty for me to have a very deep trip. Of course I could always double or triple it.
</p>

<p>
	But 125ug of LSD enough for me to start seeing eyes in my couch pillow. It's a subtle effect. They are not full-blown eyes. But at higher doses they definitely will be. Mushrooms also work the same way for me. I tend to see eyes and other weird patterns on mushrooms.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Then dimiss the opinions of everyone who has done fewer than 50 trips, since they have insufficient experience to speak about psychedelics.
</p>

<p>
	If you take the opinions of people with zero psychedelic experience seriously, you will come to erronious conclusions.

</p>

<p>
	Start small. You don't need 5-MeO at this point.

<p>
	Imagination has many levels of depth to it.
</p>

<p>
	The walls of your house are imaginary, but this is a degree of imagination which is beyond your typical human purview.
</p>

<p>
	In other words, you as God are imagining (at very deep levels), that the walls of your house are not imaginary but real. In this way God creates physics.
</p>

<p>
	If you chnage your state of consciousness you will see that those physical walls were actually imaginary all along.

			Do you think the death of the “hero” (which is me, in this so-called imaginary reality) is a similar state of the consciousness when I fall asleep? Every day I go to bed and fall asleep. But the peculiar thing is that I am not conscious of that shift. Sometimes, very rarely, before I fall asleep, I have a sensation like I am falling from the cliff down, other times I hear the nonsense talk in my mind, like meaningless words or sentences. And then I go absolutely unconscious till wake up in the morning and starting to remember me, as Galyna, again, with all my life story. I truly want to understand how this so-called imagination with the name Galyna, will cease to exist, and consciousness starts imagining you, for example. How will this shift happen? Is it going to be the same as going to sleep? I fall asleep as Galyna and wake up as a baby Leo? Do you think it is the way consciousness shifts between various imaginations? Also, I feel pain grasping this, because I think of it within the linear time frame, for instance, consciousness started to imagine Mark-Bella-Galyna-Leo.
		</p>

		<p>
			Is there any plausible explanation so I can imagine this better?  
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	It's not really possible to explain. You need to experience nondual consciousness. Then things will clear up.
</p>

<p>
	I recommend trying a psychedelic which will help you to understand this stuff.
</p>

<p>
	It's more radical and twisted than you presently imagine.
</p>

<p>
	Sleep is not consciousness. Awakening is the opposite of sleep.
</p>

<p>
	Definitely this is the biggest challenge of the path: embodying it deeply in everyday life. This is especially difficult with psychedelics because they take you so high so fast, no one can live from those places of infinite consciousness and still interact in the social world.
</p>

<p>
	At high doses of psychedelics you are not a human any more. It is like venturing to new alien dimensions.

<p>
	Hard to say, but he seems to have to grown enormously and accessed levels of understanding which very few human being ever will.
</p>

<p>
	This is why a binary classification scheme for awakening is so problematic. It hides so many other aspects of growth and understanding.

It is literally infinite and it is God. You think an infinite mind cannot simultaneously imagine a trillion lives and sync them all up to each other? Programmers easily do that for millions of people in modern online videos games using piddly finite silicon computers.
</p>

<p>
	Quantum waves are something you imagine.
</p>

<p>
	The ONLY way a thing can exist is if it is held in your consciousness.

</p>

<p>
	What's needed is not a belief that he was imaginary but a change in your state of consciousness.
</p>

<p>
	Also don't forget that imagination is reality. So your dog is real: as real as anything else can be.
</p>

<p>
	When everything is a dream, all dreamed up creations have a reality of their own.

</p>

<p>
	None of that is the Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	I am a fallible human and I sometimes make intellectual mistakes. But that does not change the Absolute one bit. The Absolute does not hinge on anything I say or any mistake I make. I could become a lying mass murdering con-man, but the Absolute will still be the Absolute.

<p>
	Absolute Truth is beyond an open or closed mind. It is absolute.
</p>

<p>
	You need to be wise enough to forsee that, otherwise you'll be compromising with ignorance.
</p>

<p>
	The Absolute cannot be "wrong" because wrong is a duality.
</p>

<p>
	God cannot be wrong nor can it be doubted.
</p>

<p>
	It sounds religious because it is GOD! What do you want me to do? Deny God to please your egoic standards?
</p>

<p>
	No, that will not happen. Truth does not comprise with falsehood. If you can't accept that, it's actually because your mind is closed.
</p>

<p>
	You need to be open to the possibility of closing your mind when it comes to doubting God. What you are closing your mind to is falsehood. Which is proper.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	It sounds like you've had some taste of awakening but it also sounds like you've got much deeper to go.
</p>

<p>
	So good job, but also keep going deeper.

<p>
	I wouldn't worry too much about New Agers and hippies. They are actually one of the most evolved segments of our society. Of course they are not Buddhas, but you should be more worried about the rednecks.
</p>

<p>
	We need MORE New Agers and hippies, not to ridicule them.
</p>

<p>
	One of my critiques of JP Sears channel is that in ridiculing New Agers he ends up making stage Orange people feel superior when they are in fact less evolved than the people they are laughing at. Most viewers on YT do not understand that they are ridiculing hippies from below, not above!
</p>

<p>
	Ridicule of stage Green is becoming a favorite business model on YT, and it's very harmful to the evolution of society because millions of ignorant people get the idea that stage Green is bad, moronic, impractical, deluded, unworkable, etc. This is like having a Youtube channel which makes fun of reading books.

<p>
	As you know, many of those New Agers and Hippies tend to be stage Green. Which makes them much more evolved and conscious than the average person. So are they closer to awakening? Sure, but most of them are still very far.
</p>

<p>
	It's easier to awaken a hippie than a redneck.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The devil's favorite defense mechanism is distraction and corruption of the highest truth. If the devil can de-fang a spiritual teaching by turning it into a New Age fad, that's ideal for his purposes!
</p>

<p>
	How easy would enlightenment be if all spiritual teachings led directly to God? Too easy! The devil's gotta muddy those waters to hell so no one finds the Truth.
</p>

<p>
	Direct spiritual teachings are too hardcore for most people. So they need to be watered down for mainstream audiences, but in doing so they become completely ineffective and even counter-productive.
</p>

<p>
	And, BTW, making fun of and judging pseudo-woke spiritual New Agers is itself a distraction <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
