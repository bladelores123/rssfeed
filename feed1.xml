<p>
	Of course I was generalizing about the hardcore conservatives. Moderate conservatives are more open to a compromise like I prosed.
</p>

<p>
	In fact, we have reached a reasonable compromise decades ago with Roe v Wade. A majority of Americans are happy with it.
</p>

<p>
	Outlawing abortion would be anti-democratic as only a small vocal minority want that.

I could be wrong. Just my guess.
</p>

<p>
	The point is that awakening does not automatically preclude nationalism. Zen monks have historically been very nationalistic, even supporting Imperial Japan's aggressive actions in WWII.

<p>
	Dude, those are your relative standards. Ain't not mystic or guru gotta follow that.
</p>

<p>
	The basic spiritual principle you're failing to follow here is: non-judgment.
</p>

<p>
	By judging Mooji you actually reveal yourself to be less conscious than him. He probably wouldn't judge you.
</p>

<p>
	Of all the people in the world you could be harping on, you choose Mooji?? He has helped awaken more people than you can count. How many people have you helped to awaken?

<p>
	Hehehe....
</p>

<p>
	That's the whole trick. Money is survival. Business is survival. If it wasn't for that, LP would be easy and everyone would be doing it.
</p>

<p>
	The whole trick to following your dreams is that you also have to be extremely pragmatic about it. You can't just dream shit up, you have to make it fly in the real world given all the limitations and restrictions of the real world. In other words, if you want you dreams to be actualized, you need to find a path for their survival on the material plane, otherwise they will remain merely ideas floating around in your mind. The hard part of life is creating a material thing which can sustain itself and yet still not be so evil as the destroy everything in its path.
</p>

<p>
	To actualized your dreams is not much different than creating a baby, expect it's harder because now God doesn't do it automatically for you. Now you have to engineer it yourself and you must make sure it can survive. Now you are consciously playing God. What kind of God will you be? What kind of monstrosity will you create?

<title>Resources required To become a Life Coach</title>
<link>https://www.actualized.org/forum/topic/44105-resources-required-to-become-a-life-coach/?do=findComment&amp;comment=557638</link>
<description><![CDATA[

<br />


							
							
<p>
	You are not going to learn to be a life coach online. This is something that needs to be learned face-to-face.
</p>

<p>
	Serious coaching programs usually cost $5,000-$10,000. Such a program will teach you most of the basics. But even then, your ability to earn money is not guaranteed. Being a successful coach requires knowing how to run a small business -- because that's what coaching for pay is. So you will also needs to develop business and marketing skills. Then you'll have a chance at success.
</p>

<p>
	Being in India makes things a lot more complicated because the level of development of that country will probably look down upon life coaching. You could find ways to make it work but you'll have to get creative and innovate to find what solutions are needed by the people in your country.
</p>

<p>
	Realistically I'd say your first step should be to find a way to study aboard. Then maybe you can return back and build a business there.
</p>

<p>
	Research online for various coaching programs. I did this one and recommend it:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://www.ipeccoaching.com/" rel="external nofollow">https://www.ipeccoaching.com</a>
</p>

<p>
	They offer a training in Singapore. But it costs about $10,000. But if you think about it, $10k for a career training is actually very cheap. A university degree would cost you a lot more. At least in the US. Not sure about how it works in India.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	This advice is specifically for you (Arzola) not others.
</p>

<p>
	Double down on the work you are already doing rather than distracting yourself with university coursework. You will not find Truth or Love in a university unless you bring it there from the outside.
</p>

<p>
	Self-taught philosophy is the only true kind. The rest is parroting the words of dead men.

<p>
	How about going to a Zen monastery or Indian ashram instead? Those will toughen you up without contributing to the needless death of others.
</p>

<p>
	There are many ways to toughen yourself up. For example, you can go camping in the wilderness for a month.

<p>
	There are ways to work behind the scenes, but if you're going to contribute to the world in a meaningful way then naturally people will come to hear of you and your work.
</p>

<p>
	Don't think of it as pursuing fame. That's silliness. Rather, you're just executing your vision for the world and whoever hears about it will hear it about, it shouldn't bother you. And probably you want your work to touch many people, otherwise what's the point?

	Online dating is a very specific thing. Everyone is there with the goal of hooking up. It's the online equivalent of a nightclub. That's not the case with Facebook, Instagram, YT, forums, etc.

<p>
	The conservative girl is unable to wrap her mind around the idea that gender is a relative mental construct. So to her the idea of something other than the traditional, black & white man/woman roles does not compute and seems absurd.
</p>

<p>
	Blue REALLY struggles with issues of relativity. They just don't stomach relativity because to them the world is absolutely as their beliefs say.
</p>

<p>
	This is also a good example of how the mind projects. The conservative girl's mind thinks that it can make others look foolish when really it is projecting its own foolishness as a denial mechanism so that she doesn't have to deeply question the groundless distinctions that make up her worldview.
</p>

<p>
	But also notice how stage Green (the TYT hosts) are also unable to understand where this conservative girl is coming from. They just think she's a fool, when really, her mind is simply not yet fathoming the relative nature of reality.

</p>

<p>
	Were you directly conscious of it or not? Forget what Jim Carry or Leo say.
</p>

<p>
	I cannot speak to your medication issues, I'm not a psychiatrist and I have no idea what you're taking or why.
</p>

<p>
	I suspect you may be on these medications but really you are spiritually gifted and the medication is suppressing that in you. If you have a spiritually gifted mind don't expect others to understand what you're dealing with because they are in a different reality relative to you. Your job is to figure out how to harness your paranormal abilities. Regular doctors and psychiatrists will not understand and they will give you improper and even harmful advice simply because they are spiritually clueless and they only see your case from the materialist paradigm.
</p>

<p>
	Sounds to me like you are a shaman in the making, but society and your parents have been leading you astray from your destiny. It takes a lot of soul-searching and inner work to harness your unique paranormal abilities. This usually involves a great inner struggle.

<title>Why does the Dalai Llama say ''Keep Europe for Europeans.''?</title>

<p>
	Dalai Lama spent his whole life fighting for Tebatan nationalism.
</p>

<p>
	Given the era he was born in, you'd expect him to have nationalistic tendencies. And of course he is a cultural icon of Tibet. He embraces his culture.
</p>

<p>
	Enlightenment does not free the mind of its cultural programming and biases.
</p>

<p>
	More broadly speaking, transcending culture does not mean all cultures disappear and you cannot tell the difference between Japan and Mexico or Brazil and Italy. You just stop creating an identity out of any one particular culture.
</p>

<p>
	I can acknowledge American culture, for example, without attaching myself to "being an American". I am not an American because I am the whole Universe. So are you.

<p>
	Higher dose mushrooms are very challenging.
</p>

<p>
	I found 4-AcO-DMT to be very challenging too when plugged. Total mindfuckery beyond description.
</p>

<p>
	Many people find DPT challenging. I can see it being so at high doses.

<p>
	Still not pure enough. Your home filteration system will not be as good as industrial grade filtration.

	Pure spring water costs $30/mo per person in America. Don't be cheap. Your health costs way more. You pay more for your phone bill.

<title>Radical Opinion on Abortion?</title>

</p>

<p>
	In practice, though I agree that we can set some reasonable cut-off point for normal healthy pregnancies. Perhaps at 4 months. And longer if doc sees there are complications.
</p>

<p>
	I think this would be a good political compromise. But the hardcore right-wing will not accept such a compromise because they got it in their mind that all abortion is murder and they use compromise to keep pushing that timeline lower and lower and lower because they want it at zero and with no exceptions for rape, incest, or complications.
</p>

<p>
	But about 75% of the US would agree to such a compromise. The ban abortion crowd is a small but vocal minority.

</p>

<p>
	If you do not use your mind properly, you will get nightmares come to life. If you don't want nightmares, think pure thoughts. If you cannot help but think impure thoughts that is because you have not done sufficient growth, development, and spiritual purification work.
</p>

<p>
	Impure mind comes from bad karma.

	Push yourself to approach even if you have 10 good excuses for why you shouldn't. That is the key. Just don't listen to your mind at this moment. If you start arguing with yourself about whether you should approach, you've already failed. You need to literally just start moving your legs towards the girl. The mind may protest but the legs can walk.
</p>

<p>
	The crucial mistake is thinking you should have something good to say upon approach. Don't prepare anything to say. Just approach and be as genuine about it as possible. Do not try to prepare a good line or opener. Just approach with a smile and good eye contact. The words need to come to you authentically after the open. Trying to pre-script it is a big mistake.
</p>

Friends are not made that way. Go out into the real world and put your balls on the line.
</p>

<p>
	You are basically spamming people to be your friend, which looks really weak, so of course they don't respond back.
</p>

<p>
	You should not be using online for building connection/attraction. The proper use of text messages and the like is to facilitate real-life meetings which you've already had in the past and want more of in the future. They are not to be used as a substitute for face-to-face.

<title>Trip Report: Trying LSD for the first time</title>

<p>
	1) How many ug's was each of your tabs? They can vary a lot. Purity can also vary. Some tabs can be weak. You should aim for about 125ug tabs.
</p>

<p>
	2) LSD has at least 1 week of tolerance build-up, so tripping twice in one week will make your second trip much less. So doubling those tabs probably had the same effect of 1 tab.
</p>

<p>
	3) You may have natural tolerance to it, requiring higher doses.
</p>

<p>
	4) Clearly your mind is full of impurities, which is why you get into this bad trip territory. All of that psychological baggage needs to be worked through so you are free to tackle the serious existential questions like God, Truth, and Love.
</p>

<p>
	"Within me", "out there", and "another person" are thoughts.
</p>

<p>
	You cannot use thought to grasp thought any more than you can use a knife to cut itself.
</p>

<p>
	Sit in silence and observe thoughts arising.

	Sometimes I will trip with a girlfriend, but that's not for serious, deep work. That's mostly for fun.
</p>

<p>
	The deep work is done solo.
</p>

<p>
	Although psychedelics present some interesting opportunities for deepening intimate relationships and sexuality. But that's its own thing, it's not the core of our work here. And you're not gonna do that in a group setting anyway. That's basically a solo trip for two lovers.

<title>Radical Opinion on Abortion?</title>

<p>
	Notice how this issue involves a struggle to draw a boundary/duality between: alive vs not-alive, conscious vs not-conscious, autonomous vs not-autonomous, part of the mother vs not part of the mother, fully human vs biomass, human vs fly, right vs wrong, moral vs immoral, etc.
</p>

<p>
	The mind wants to ground reality in such boundaries, but all such boundaries are untenable because reality is ONE. Which is why you struggle and struggle to draw those boundaries but will always fail. And why people disagree so much about where the boundaries lie.
</p>

<p>
	There is no point at which a baby is conscious or alive or autonomous or human. There is no point at which a baby is separate from a pine tree. Getting that takes you meta. Learning this lesson is one of the most important things Actualized.org has to teach you. Stop falling into the trap of objectifying dualistic distinctions. If you manage to do that, your mind will be set radically free and peace can come to the world.
</p>

<p>
	Or, continue fighting over imagined dualities.

	It was totally expected if you understand LSD dosages.

<p>
	20ug is almost nothing.

<p>
	Surrounding observers are part of your imagination.
</p>

<p>
	If you put on sunglasses the world doesn't tint for everyone else.
</p>

<p>
	Consciousness compartmentalizes itself, otherwise things would become a shitshow. How silly would it be if my putting on sunglasses tinted your world? That would spoil the illusion of objective reality. We could code a video game to work that way, but why?
</p>

<p>
	You have to carefully think through the consequences of your imagined scenarios. Life has a very intelligent design. It is not some willy-nilly stuff that some idiot threw together. It is a design of utmost genius that allows for rich experiences like that of humans. This requires some serious design constraints.

<p>
	The flaw in your thinking is not taking into account that your are currently putting enormous energy into imagining exactly your current reality. To enter a new reality you'd have to stop imaging this one.
</p>

<p>
	If you fully imagined a new reality nothing would be left of the current one. That would basically be a totally new life. And then you would still ask, "But why can't I be in some 3rd reality?" You can! But then you lose the 2nd one. You can't be in two realities at once. You have to pick one, which means excluding all others.

			What for? Studies have shown that 80% of the Australian population does not believe it's carbon emissions are linked to climate change. A good 40% believe climate change isn't real.
		</p>

		<p>
			Australians will keep voting in prime ministers who deny climate change, use sneaky tactics to get out of carbon emission deals with the UN, put environmental protesters in jail for protesting against malicious corporates that are causing climate change, even when these bush fires are happening.
		</p>

		<p>
			Go look at the comments from news.com.au most Australians have a pathological hatred for the greens, labour and the left. The silent majority of Australia hates climate change and believe it's some sort of evil plan by the left to take over the world.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you donate to the Bush fires, youre donating to people who choose to deny climate change, vote in anti climate change priministers, a surge of people who are strongly against progessive values. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Let Australians burn, we are going to need more then 2000 houses and 20 people killed before they wake up. Watch after these bush fires, everything will be forgotten and the liberal PM will be voted back in. Just like how everyone forgot the black Friday fires.

</blockquote>

<p>
	Where is your compassion?
</p>

<p>
	Even if 40% are in denial, that means 60% are not.
</p>

<p>
	It's not like these donations will prevent Aussies from waking up. If climate change is real, it will hit them again soon.
</p>

<p>
	Seems like this event already will change a lot of minds. Maybe not those who have career conflicts of interest, but much of the populace who don't.
</p>

<p>
	It won't take too many of these fires to wake Aussies up.

			That's what mass murderers do. If they are going to murder themselves, they will take others with them. Basically all mass murderers have NPD (narcissistic personality disorder).

	You got your causality backwards.

<p>
	That's what low consciousness egos do.

<p>
	Narcissist != psychopath
</p>

<p>
	Stage Red is not psychopathy. It just appears that way to higher stage people who lack the nuanced understanding of these complex issues.
</p>

<p>
	It's all too easy to call dictators and strong-men psychopaths or "crazy" because the mind is looking for a way to dismiss them as so "other" as to be incomprehensible. But that's not the case. Stage Red explains Trump's actions quite well. Study Stage Red more.

<p>
	When we inquire into the existential nature of a thing -- like in this case the notion of reproduction -- we do not limit ourselves by survival concerns. Rather, we go for what is true.
</p>

<p>
	What is reproduction? That is the question. Do not corrupt this question with egoic fears.
</p>

<p>
	If it is true that reproduction is an illusion, then that is what's true! Even if it means the whole human race will die out as a result of knowing it.
</p>

<p>
	And of course it doesn't have to mean that at all. Good luck getting 7 billion people to stop fucking. Even the intelligent ones. Even the enlightened ones still manage to fuck like rabbits.

<p>
	Nothing less will work.
</p>

<p>
	So long as you are attached to needing to survive, you are enslaved to falsehood and all your actions will be corrupted by devilry.
</p>

<p>
	This is what is really means to sell your soul to the devil. Your birth was the selling of your soul. Now you are in a struggle to get your soul back.
</p>

<p>
	You sold your soul the day you said, "I am a human."
</p>

<p>
	How does a devil scrub himself of himself?

<p>
	Whatever is True is whatever is True. How it feels is irrelevant. The ego-mind can react to Truth in a thousand different ways. It's safe to say that your ego-mind reacted so much that you never even got a solid look at what Truth is.
</p>

<p>
	If Truth makes you upset, you're not solidly conscious of it. You still have a lot of defilements to surrender.

<p>
	A deeply religious man who spent his whole life studying the Bible hears a knock on his door.
</p>

<p>
	He asks, "Who is it?"
</p>

<p>
	"It's God. Open up. I have come to show you the way."
</p>

<p>
	"Oh wow! This is amazing! But please come back next week, I'm really busy right now reading about you in this Bible."
</p>

<p>
	Because the alternative is often worse.
</p>

<p>
	Commitment just means you're not a selfish child who runs away at the first sign of trouble or something better on the horizon.
</p>

<p>
	It's not different than commitment to a business plan or showing up on time to a meeting. It's hard to create anything worthwhile in life without a commitment. Try executing any major project without a serious commitment. See how far you get.
</p>

<p>
	You couldn't even keep a hamster without a commitment.

<p>
	In practice that's hard to pull off. Public corporations are so competitive that even the CEO could get fired any day if he fails to perform up to expectations.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are always exceptions but most large corporations do not tolerate nepotism these days. Competition is just too fierce to allow such things to fly.
</p>

<p>
	Of course there are other problems with hierarchies and domination which have nothing to do with simple nepotism. There is more sophisticated devilry at work within large corporations. The devilry gets extremely sophisticated in order to sneak under the radar.

</p>

<p>
	The reason your examples seem popular is because men's rights groups and conservative groups have waged a PR war against feminism by purposefully strawmanning and demonized it. This is all part of their denial and collective ego backlash against integrating what feminism brings to the table.
</p>

<p>
	Demonization of feminism, progressivism, and socialism is very popular on YT and in right-wing circles. It's a cottage industry. People make entire careers of it -- such as Jordan Peterson. But really his positions are so ignorant that they do not even warrant serious intellectual engagement. It it an insult to a true intellectual to have to defend against such right-wing ignorance.

<p>
	I just don't take such positions seriously. I don't know any serious person who believes or advocates "men are trash" or some such. That's not what feminism is about. A quality feminist understands the value and importance of masculinity and men.
</p>

<p>
	You can find all kinds of nonsense on the internet. That doesn't mean it represents what feminism is about. There are fringe people in every social movement who spout crazy nonsense. To cherrypick those fringe ideas and make them representative of the entire movement is intellectually dishonest and shows a lack of nuance and lack of understanding how movements work.
</p>

<p>
	By your logic we can demonize all of science as long as I can find a few articles written by some fringe scientists about how black people are genetically inferior to white people. But it would be absurd to use such fringe examples as representative of science as a whole.

	1) The story it tells
</p>

<p>
	2) How it shows up in your consciousness, its being
</p>

<p>
	If you had a thought in a foreign language which you did not understand the sounds would register in your consciousness (that's the actuality or being of a thought) but it would have no meaning/content/story.
</p>

<p>
	速い茶色のキツネが怠zyな犬を飛び越えた
</p>

<p>
	That sentence has being for you but no meaning (unless you know Japanese).
</p>

<p>
	Notice that being is what's primary while meaning is secondary. You can have being without meaning but you cannot have meaning without being.

<title>People at the top of a hierarchy aren't there because they have power</title>

<p>
	There is a complex interplay between the two.
</p>

<p>
	Plenty of people at the top do deserve to be there because they are exceptionally skilled, talented, experienced, and hard working. But there are many exceptions such as Trump.
</p>

<p>
	In a modern corporation you will not rise to the top unless you are exceptionally good at your job. But even so, that doesn't justify the exploitation of those below you.

			There was an Iraqi guy studying at Glasgow Caledonian University. I did not know him personally, but we had common friends and they always said good things about him. 3 years after I came back to my country from UK, I heard he was killed in Iraq along with his father and other men. The reason for his murder was because he was sunni. The killers were shia militia which was also supported by Gasem Soleimani. This is just one fact what Iran is and Gasem Soleimani was doing in the region.

<p>
	Of course Iran is less developed on the Spiral than the US and Iran has a collective ego and does behave in devilish ways.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, while Trump threatens Iranian cultural sites Iran is conscious enough to explicitly say they will not target US civilians.
</p>

<p>
	So far Iran has the moral high ground.

	If you ever die in your dreams you should notice that you still exist as nothingness afterwards.
</p>

<p>
	That should be your clue that you cannot actually die.

	Jerking off into napkin is killing a billion lives.
</p>

<p>
	Having a period is killing a life.
</p>

<p>
	Surviving an infection is killing millions of microscopic lives.
</p>

<p>
	See the arbitrariness and self-bias of how your ego-mind draws its boundaries.
</p>

<p>
	Pro-lifers are stuck because they refuse to admit the relativity of morality. And nothing you say will change their mind because they are not interested in seeking truth, they are interested in defending their beliefs.
</p>

<p>
	What people don't want to admit is that all evil is imaginary and invented by the ego for the purpose of its survival. Evil is falsehood.

			There's already a men rights movement. Why? Because men already feel they are being oppressed.

</blockquote>

<p>
	No, men are not being oppressed. The ego just perceives equalizing as oppression because a self-biased mind doesn't see a difference.
</p>

<p>
	If you owned slaves 200 years ago your ego-mind would perceive abolition as unfair and oppressive. Because it is from the POV of a slave owner. The slave owner feels fully entitled to own slaves. To take way his slaves would appear to him as robbery or debasement of the natural order.
</p>

<p>
	Equality is a radical thing. It means the ego has to surrender what it has taken for granted as its own.
</p>

<p>
	It is a projection of a low consciousness mind that if it gives up domination it will be dominated by those who complained about being dominated by it. The key is to realize that those you dominated may not be interested in dominating you back, they just want a non-dominating dynamic on all sides.

			I see what you mean, but I was talking about the feeling of love towards someone. I guess a better way to ask it is: <strong>Do you need to consciously work on relationships to keep feeling connected and feeling love or once it starts to fade it's unlikely to be felt again?</strong>

<p>
	Yes, of course the key to good relationships is constant conscious work on them.

<p>
	Women had less rights because for the majority of mankind's evolution the state of consciousness was so low that physical force determined rights and power hierarchies. Survival was unbelievably brutal and physical. The strongest dominated the weakest and established "rights" and rules which served them.
</p>

<p>
	But now we are starting to move away from brutal animalistic survival and now the physical strength difference between men and women is becoming less and less important.
</p>

<p>
	It is not a matter of men deciding to give women rights, but rather the entire species is evolving in consciousness and society is developing hard and soft infrastructure which allows for non-violent means of existence. This is not a process anyone controls. Men do not control it. Both men and women are puppets of larger evolutionary forces which drive the entire universe towards greater consciousness and love. Those who are physically weaker are treated with more compassion. This is true not just of women but children, the sick, the disabled, the mentally ill, animals, the environment, etc.
</p>

<p>
	Once you are conscious enough it is no longer tenable to dominate others even if you happen to be physically bigger or stronger than them. It hurts your own consciousness to do so. Ego is slowly realizing the existential equality of all beings by looking past the material differences -- which are not fundamentally important.
</p>

<p>
	Rather than seeing all this as a fight for rights, see it as an expansion of consciousness, love, and self-identity.
</p>

<p>
	If you were highly conscious and had high Self-Love, you would not have a desire to dominate anyone, even if it gave you some temporary material gain. The material gain is inferior to Selflessness.
</p>

<p>
	Love is EVERYTHING.
</p>

<p>
	It doesn't matter what feeling you have or choice you make. That is the point. The ego sets conditions on love to suit its survival because it's biased. But love is not limited to that. Love is unlimited, infinite, and unconditional. Whether you understand that is another matter.

	Enlightened people can still be closedminded to things. They can still cling to false beliefs about the relative world. And they certainly still have biases of which they are not aware.

	Not at all.

<p>
	Philosophy classes in universities are as conformist and unoriginal as Sunday School.

<p>
	All of Harvard is a conformist nest. Little orginal thinking happens there.
</p>

<p>
	Do not confuse such things for truth-seeking or thinking. They are playing academic survival games. Nobody at Harvard understands what reality is or how consciousness works.

<p>
	No actual philosophy is done in a philosophy classroom. That would be far too dangerous to be allowed.
