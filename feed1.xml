	If you are expecting something immediately practical out of it, you won't get that.
</p>

<p>
	It is a work of art. It has to be appreciated like fine art.

You do not understand my situation and I am not going to waste time explaining to you. I have a dozen people giving me unsolicited and blind advice in a dozen different directions. Yet they don't even know my health situation or what I have already tried. It's a waste of time. It's not wise to stick your nose too much in someone else's business. I know you're just trying to help, but you know nearly nothing about my health.

	For anyone reading this who wants a good summary of how to treat SIBO, here you go:
</p>

<p>
	<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/sibo-notes/treatment" rel="external nofollow">https://sites.google.com/view/sibo-notes/treatment</a>
</p>

<p>
	In my experience, none of that will work unless you radically cut out all carbs from your diet. Ideally carnivore for at least a month or two. Stop consuming all carbs entirely.
</p>

<p>
	Before you invest in all these treatment protocols make sure your do a SIBO breath test to verify that you have hydrogen or methane SIBO. The breath test is crucial.

<p>
	My Mom has Hashimoto's and other autoimmunity. But my condition is not identical to hers. Mine is much more severe.
</p>

<p>
	There is definitely a genetic factor, but it's not that the genetics are bad, it's that the triggers must be discovered and eliminated.

It's the standard anti-microbial supplement treatment plan: allicin, berberine, and grapefruit seed extract.
</p>

<p>
	I've been taking those for months to no avail.
</p>

<p>
	And I am still experimenting with various supplement combos.
</p>

<p>
	Carnivore diet has been way more effective for me then any supplement combo I've tried so far. And I've tried something like 100+ supplements.
</p>

<p>
	Supplements are useless when there is an underlying autoimmune condition triggered by diet and toxins.

	There is nothing scientific about atheism, rationalism, materialism, or realism. It's all pure fantasy.

<p>
	Yes, consciousness is missing.
</p>

<p>
	When you become infinitely conscious you will drown in an Infinite Love that never ends.
</p>

<p>
	NDE's and occult practices are still low consciousness stuff compared to what I am talking about.
</p>

<p>
	God would never punish anyone because God IS everyone. Punishment is only desired by limited beings and fragmented consciousness. Infinite Consciousness has no need whatsoever for punishment and in fact it is literally incapable of punishment because all it can do is Love itself endlessly.
</p>

<p>
	GOD IS LOVE.
</p>

<p>
	Why would it be anything less?

<p>
	But if I had to choose between living 65 years on carnivore vs 80 years on vegan, with how much better I feel on carnivore factored in, I would rather live 65. No doubts about it.
</p>

<p>
	Longevity is meaningless without energy and quality of life. I can accomplish more work in 65 of carnivore than 80 years of vegan. At least given my current health condition. Hopefully I can change that.

			Leo, on the video you say carnivore is not for the long term but on the other hand the inuit and every hunter-gatherer tribe from the beginning of time ate mostly meat, for their entire life. Meat has been always the main food of humans. How can that be bad now when it wasn't bad our entire existence? I mean those tribes didn't have modern illnessess like we do now.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Longevity in meateating tribes is not good. They get clogged arteries. Most of them simply don't live long enough to get a stroke or heart attack because tribal folk tend to die young of natural causes.
</p>

<p>
	High meat diet will definitely skyrocket your cholestorol, the bad kind.

<p>
	I tried a bit of egg white protein powder and it didn't sit well with me.

<p>
	But at this point basically nothing sits well with me. Even meat causes me problems at times. My condition is very unpredictable. Sometimes a food causes problems and other days it doesn't.

<p>
	Close to 3lbs of meat/chicken/salmon all combined per day.
</p>

<p>
	On carnivore you got little choice in the matter. You must eat however much calories your body requires per day. Oil and butter can help reduce the meat intake a bit.

			Leo, how do you think you'd fare adding white rice and/or well-cooked well-salted potatoes to your current carnivore diet? Perhaps that alteration could help to make the diet sustainable? Ensuring a minimum of ~125g carbs per day. Just thinking out loud.

<p>
	No way. Rice and potatoes are some of the worse aggrivators of my SIBO.

Try to bridge the gap with a life purpose that's a bit more closer to your experience of life. You are making an LP about a thing you haven't even experienced, don't know is real, and don't even know if you will like.
</p>

<p>
	You gotta test all those waters first and see if it really is something you're passionate about. Don't assume your passions, feel for them in the now. What are you passionate about now that in part of your life experience?
</p>

<p>
	You can always expand out into 5-MeO or awakening once you experience it and find it resonates.
</p>

<p>
	The problem with assuming too much is that you will find you aren't as passionate about that thing as you thought once you actually experience it. It can be easy to fall in love with the IDEA of a thing rather than the thing itself. So be careful not to fall into that trap.
</p>

	It doesn't really matter. People should get together and honestly decide what is fair and appropriate for a healthy society without any self-bias skewing the issue. The problem is that such decisions are always tainted with self-bias.

	Yeah. I'm not surprised at all. You can smell those toxic Red and Orange fumes from a mile away. It's so obvious once you got some consciousness. I've only watched Brian for like 3 minutes, and that was enough for me to smell the fumes.
</p>

<p>
	BTW, I found a great interview he did with Sadhguru -- where Sahdguru basically tells him about how toxic modern politics is. And then Brian goes on to do this toxic mayoral campaign, Lol

<p>
	They earn way less than $35k/yr.
</p>

<p>
	I don't know what the exact salary should be, but it's also not only about salary, it is about unionization, benefits, good treatment, paid time off, parental leave, and democracy at the workplace.
</p>

<p>
	Peeing in bottles is not how employees should be treated.
</p>

<p>
	Given how ridiculously wealthy Amazon is, working there should be a pleasure, not slavery. People there should be working 4 days a week and getting month-long vacations.

<p>
	It's a fine personal goal, but LP is not about what you do for yourself. It's about what you want to do for others.
</p>

<p>
	So in this case once you finally reach your goal, a valid LP would be to spread that experience to others.
</p>

<p>
	So you're close to an LP, but you're stilling thinking of it too selfishly.
</p>

<p>
	Your LP might be to help OTHERS expeirence 5-MeO-DMT. Although that is risky business so be careful with how you go about that.

	Nice!
</p>

<p>
	It's true of course, but still, on a practical level it seems like practicing love is not enough without also changing your state of conscioussness somehow.
</p>

<p>
	You can't really love from a low state of consciousness, and these fucking entities should know that.

	Vegan diet is definitely the diet I feel worst on. It does not work for me at all, and I tried it multiple times.
</p>

<p>
	And it is basically impossible to do vegan diet when you got a bad case of SIBO. You would be in so much pain you would want to kill yourself.

<p>
	Basically yes.
</p>

<p>
	You need to complete 5 or 10 years of basic self-help work before you can start to appreciate the value of higher things like God or Love or consciousness or Truth or spirituality.
</p>

<p>
	Nothing wrong with that. You can't grow faster than you're able. Spend the next 5-10 years building your basic success in life. Then come back and we'll talk about God.

	Your question is basically a highly technical scientific question. We would need a team of advance scientists to study and map out the mechanism. And the mechanism is always going to be infinite so you can keep mapping reality forever and never reach the end.
</p>

<p>
	All mechanistic explanations must recede into infinite complexity.

			There are trends that will crystalize into a new type/wave of Billionaires soon who will bring forth many new perspectives, including increased harmony. Similar to the Entrepreneurship wave that was created by the Internet. This both the high range (50-100 Billion net worth) and also 100-200  new people entering the Billionaires club about the 1-2 Billion range. All with product and service creation primarily. Not Wall Street types. This is expected to continue for the next couple hundred years at least easily with no effective way to change it.
		</p>

		<p>
			What are your thoughts on that?

<p>
	I do believe that in general, business people and businesses will be forced to become more conscious or go extinct.
</p>

<p>
	But the question is at what pace this happens and to what extent. And there there are practical concerns about how much to tax them, how to regulate them, etc.
</p>

<p>
	I don't have a problem with people earning lots of money by truly generating lots of value for mankind via genuine creative labor. What I have a problem with is business-people who leech and exploit the working class. And either way, even those genuine creative folk need to be taxed and regulated more.
</p>

<p>
	If you earn over $5 mill per year, you should be taxed very heavily because the only reason you're able to earn that much money is thanks to a community and a society. You are not doing it on your own. The community is allowing you to do it. Therefore you should not be allowed to keep doing it at the expense of the community.
</p>

<p>
	No one would be pissed off at billionaires if they paid their taxes and paid their employees well and didn't corrupt the political system. Those are the real issues. Stop being a dick. That's all we're asking for.
</p>

			No amount of fasting and carnivore, or any other diet changes can get rid of SIBO, Leo. No amount! My claim is that everyone who says they healed their gut is either delusional or straight up lying.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Well, this is a rather uncharitable and self-serving position to take. Many people claim to have healed their gut with carnivore, and to dismiss these genuine people as liars or deluded doesn't sound wise. Perhaps the one fooling yourself in this case is you.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying it's guaranteed to work. But to claim it cannot work is not right since there is no possible way you have tested every person and their conditions. You're just speculating in a dogmatic fashion.
</p>

<p>
	I am also not claiming that carnivore diet is some ultimate long-term health plan.
</p>

<p>
	When it comes to health and nutrition it's very important to respect the fact that people are different. What works for you will not work for everyone.
</p>

<p>
	I have no ideological attachment to any diet. I simply try them all out and see what works best for me. Currently carnivore is the best thing I found for my body. But that might change in the future as my health improves.

<p>
	The problem with such questions is that they assume an egoic definition of "I" or "you".
</p>

<p>
	You as this human will not experience anything more than being this human. But you as Nothingness can experience everything.
</p>

<p>
	You already ARE me. No need to return, just expand your state of consciousness.

<p>
	Yup.

<p>
	The only obstacle is a sense of finite self.

<p>
	Whenever you think of yourself as something less than EVERYTHING, that's the obstacle. Anything less than EVERYTHING isn't your full nature.

	Look at a toilet and whisper to yourself, "That's me!" And keep doing that until you stop feeling human.

<p>
	Because you are already creating exactly what you see.
</p>

<p>
	The ego thinks that God can use its infinite powers to do egoic stuff. Wrong! God cannot use its powers for anything but Infinite Love. So in sense God is totally powerless because God cannot be anything but Love. There is no choice about it. God cannot not be God. So here you are. You cannot not be you.
</p>

<p>
	You think beocoming God will make you powerful, but it will make you totally powerless. Because power and powerlessness are a duality which must come full-circle.
</p>

<p>
	The seeking of power is ego. So of course it must collapse.

</p>

<p>
	Too much existential/spiritual work can become counter-productive. You gotta balance it out with more ordinary work. Like, go work on your career, build some skills, make some sales. Then come back to spirituality and you'll appreciate it more.

<p>
	They are loud, but they are not massive.

<p>
	If you watch a lot of progressive YT, then you get a warped picture of Biden and his popularity. Progressives whine and yell a lot, but in the end Biden is very popular and most people tolerate him well enough. There will always be those 20% of the far right and left which can never be pleased because what they want is so unrealistic.
</p>

<p>
	I doubt Bernie Sanders would have been able to pass much better bills than Biden. The bottleneck is not Biden, it's the Republicans who stonewall everything, even moderate stuff. Until the Dems have a solid grasp over the Senate and House, Bernie is useless as President.

			So, then why are there more people in the US these days who are actually for culturally liberal issues and liberal judges (which are both stage Green if I am not mistaken)? Also, why have conservatives lost the popular vote in almost every presidential election since 1992? Furthermore, why are more people in our country in support of Democratic US senators (stage Orange/Green people if I am correct) than Republican US senators (stage Blue/Orange people if I am correct)?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	In US urban areas Blue is quickly dying out. For consevatives to win the popular vote they need lots of stage Blue support, but this kind of support is dying out fast as Americans shift Orange. Trump appealed a lot to Orange conservatives.
</p>

<p>
	It is possible to overpower Green by appealing to Blue/Orange, which was Trump's strategy.
</p>

<p>
	But it's also possible to overpower Blue by appealing to Green/Orange, which Biden did. And also Biden isn't so threatening to Blue. Biden exhibits many healthy Blue qualities. So overall Biden hits all the right notes with Blue, Orange, Green. There is a bit there for everyone to like and not much to hate. It's hard to hate Biden. This is one of the keys to his success. The only people who hate Biden are extremists, who are a minority.

	You gotta factor in inflation. Inflation will cause both stock values and house values to rise.

<p>
	The whole point of a house is that it's an inflation hedge. That's mostly why I bought my house.

<p>
	Not so natural, actually. Bill Gates did a lot of ruthless shit to drive all competitors into the ground. These monopolies are not accidental, they are planned with criminal precision. This is true for pretty much all giant companies.
</p>

<p>
	You don't become a billionaire without some serious devilry.
</p>

<p>
	And just because a devil is passionate about his devilry does not make it any less devilish. Yeah, most of these billionaires are passionate. So what? Again, read the fucking room.

<p>
	I've certainly been in a state of consciousness where my parents did not exist. Or, rather, they were recognized to be just figments of my own imagination created to backwards rationalize my Eternal existence.
</p>

<p>
	There are states in which the entire Universe will cease to exist, because you cease to imagine it.

<p>
	1) Dan Crenshaw's eye is the least funny thing about him. No need to stoop to such lows when we got the stupidity of his ideology to work with.
</p>

<p>
	2) Keep in mind Vaush is still in his late 20's. He's basically a big teen. He will mature a lot over the next 10-20 years. Considering his age he's doing pretty well. When I was his age I was so immature and dumb. Age matters A LOT.

			On a dose of MDMA I saw a big pillar in the middle of the dancefloor at a club clear as day. When I got nearer I saw it was just smoke and my drugged visual perception just interpreted it as a pillar and filled in the gaps until it got more information. So was there a pillar or not?

<p>
	These sorts of perceptional illusions can even happen in normal sober existence. Sometimes you look at a bush or a window and see something like an animal or a face that later you realized wasn't there.

Also if I ran into it I would not have been harmed. So there must be a difference on practical level to what we call a hallucination.
		</p>

</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes, you define non-hallucination as something you can't stick your hand through.
</p>

<p>
	But the hand itself is a hallucination on a deeper layer.
</p>

<p>
	There are layers to your hallucinations. Hallucinations within hallucinations.
</p>

<p>
	Have you never woken up from a dream only to later realize you are still stuck in a dream?
</p>

<p>
	One time I woke up from a dream 3 times before I finally returned to this dream we call "life".

<p>
	I think it still has a lot of value, but you should supplement it with reading the Spiral Dynamics book chapter on Turquoise.
</p>

<p>
	You just need to distinguish a bit more clearly mysticism and nonduality vs Turquoise. They are not the same.

<p>
	I think there are many Dems superior to her.
</p>

<p>
	I see her as a bit of a fake progressive. She has pretty deep conservative roots. She frequently sides with the right on certain issues. I don't think she has a deep grasp of things.
</p>

<p>
	I know folks like Jimmy Dore adore her (excuse the pun), but I think Jimmy Dore has lost the plot to the point of hurting the Democratic cause. It's like Dore has gone full-circle into Tucker Carlson. He's way too unreasonable and angry.
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, I think Biden is perfect right now. He's the most pragmatic and realistic of the bunch. A rabid progressive would not get much more done than Biden I think. Biden's moderate image is working very well for him. I think people underestimate Biden. He's all too easy to dismiss and mock, yet Biden can accomplish a lot of basic, practical stuff -- as he's currently on track to do. It won't be anything crazy socialist. But it will still be much welcomed. Biden can be trusted to do solid liberal governance. It's not flashy, but it works and it's badly needed and it lays the foundation for future progressive causes.

<title>Can two identical things exist within infinity?</title>

<p>
	If two things were truly identical, you could not distinguish one from the other, and they would literally become 1 thing.
</p>

<p>
	By definition, 2 requires some difference or distinction.
</p>

<p>
	In the case of red, at the least these two reds would have to differ in their x,y,z coordinates.
</p>

<p>
	It should be possible to have some qualities be identical though. Not in all ways, but in partial ways. For example, all protons have the same charge (I would assume).
</p>

	This work is not the same for all people. Some people will have it much harder than others. That's okay. Don't be so concerned with where others are at. You can only do better than your old self. That's what matters.

</p>

<p>
	Yes, generally speaking, becoming more conscious is hard. But my point is, don't make it harder than it needs to be. A lot of times you are making it extra hard by doing it wrong. So stay mindful to that. Sometimes you gotta take breaks and sometimes you gotta try doing it the opposite of how you've been doing it.
</p>

<p>
	Take a month off and do nothing. You might be surprised how much you grow from that. Efforting all the time is not really the best way. Ultimately you want to find effortless ways of doing this work. That is the ideal. If it feels too much like work then you're probably doing it wrong.

<p>
	If your goal is to lose weight you need to make permanent changes to your daily diet.
</p>

<p>
	If you forever eliminate the wrong foods from your diet, you will never have to worry about gaining weight ever again. And you don't have to starve.
</p>

<p>
	Cleaning up your diet is THE KEY to permanent and effortless weight loss.
</p>

<p>
	When you start eating healthy food and forever banish junk food, cravings become less of a thing.
</p>

<p>
	Overeating healthy whole food is basically impossible. Eat as much as you like.
</p>

<p>
	But bread, pasta, potatoes, rice, etc is not healthy food. Cut all that shit out. If you want to lose weight, cut out all grains and starches.
</p>

			Isn’t it better to actually engage with the arguments, otherwise you’re ceding ground. I feel like some on the left shun engagingly with the points which often makes them look like they “can’t handle the facts and logic” or some shit.  That’s why people like Vaush etc are effective at de-converting right wing gamer bros 
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Is Vaush's debate-lording really that effective? I think he mostly preaches to the choir.
</p>

<p>
	How many Nazi's does Vaush need to debate to prove that Nazism and white nationalism is a dumb idea? And how many of those debates do you need to hear in order to settle this case?
</p>

<p>
	You can engage of course, but also at some point the constant engagement of people with no intellectual integrity or interest in governing is just like arguing with a donkey. It becomes a waste of time. No one should be listening to Dan Crenshaw about how to govern. If you want to have a serious discussion on governing, let's have it. But let's not pretend these Fox News puppets care anything about that.
</p>

<p>
	A precondition for any serious political discussion must be 1) Intellectual integrity, 2) genuine interest in governing, and 3) historical literacy and honesty. Without these 3 things the discussion is a waste of time.

	I want to thank everyone who submitted their application for this job.
</p>

<p>
	In total I received 24 applications. A majority of them very solid and qualified people.
</p>

<p>
	However, I can only select 1. It was a difficult choice, so don't feel bad if I didn't pick you. It doesn't mean there was anything wrong with you or your application. Sometimes these things are just a coin toss when you have a dozen solid candidates.

<p>
	The issue of the reality of others is extremely touchy and fundamental because the ego self defines itself relative to "others". Without others there cannot be an ego. So the ego does everything in its power to maintain that construction. The ego cannot admit that it imagined its own mother. This admission would break the ego's reality into pieces.
</p>

<p>
	The true reason you feel that others must exist is because you have fooled yourself into identifying as a finite biological self. If you think you are human, then of course you feel that other humans must exist. That's inherent to the definition of humans. And of course, as a human your survival is so deeply social that your whole life is pretty much defined by the existence of others. Giving up all those social games is extremely threatening. This is how your mind has your nuts in a vice: socially. Because without success in the social domain you are as good as dead.
</p>

<p>
	People do not appreciate how existentially serious the social domain is. These are matters of life and death. But they are also purely imaginary. This makes for a deeply counter-intuitive mind trap.

	Right now you are holding that some God other than you is holding the Earth. But what you're missing is that it's YOU who's holding that some God is holding the Earth. That's what you're holding! And thus the Earth seems to exist for you as something solid and real beyond your mind. But those are just layers within your mind.
</p>

<p>
	You are assuming there exists someone "other" who can hold things for you. But there are no others, since you are Infinite. "Others" are what you're holding while imagining that they are holding something for you.
</p>

<p>
	Your mind is resisting understanding this because you must resist it in order to construct a reality with includes anyone other than you. Your mind is constantly in a process of constructing "others". You are sorta committed to that game. If you ever stop playing that game, all others will literally cease to exist.
</p>

<p>
	It's not so simple as others not existing. Others exist for you if you imagine they do. But if you stop imagining them, they will all cease to exist. Your core confusion is that you imagine that things can exist outside your imagination. Which is just a pure absurdity since your imagination is Infinite and Absolute.

<p>
	Perhaps stop thinking of this work or awakening as some end-point you reach.

<title>Is spiral dynamics level important when chosing a psychotherapist?</title>

<p>
	It depends on what you're using your therapist for.
</p>

<p>
	You probably don't need some super advanced therapist for handling basic survival issues.
</p>

<p>
	It gets more problematic when you want to seriously transform yourself. There, an average therapist will probably not have a deep enough grasp of psychology, epistemology, and metaphysics to help you.
</p>

<p>
	Much of what therapy boils down to is just talking stuff out. This can be helpful regardless of level. Just having someone to voice your problems to can be helpful in making you more conscious of the dynamics at play within your own psyche.
</p>

	It's not so simple or clear-cut. There are many aspects of Truth which you get glimpses of over years and slowly come to embrace.

			Also, is there anyone who has an idea why consciousness "needed to exist in the first place"?

	But the question is, would that be a net win for the animals? Would the animals prefer that?
</p>

<p>
	My point is, it's not so obvious they would.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, humans kill animals. But humans also give life to animals.

<title>Solipsism has plagued my mind for almost a year! How do I put this demon to rest.</title>

<p>
	You put the demon to rest by realizing that solipsism isn't anything bad and isn't a problem.
</p>

<p>
	There is literally no problem with it. Notice that your mind is manufacturing the problem. So what if you are alone? Enjoy life all the same. And if you can't enjoy life alone, you also can't enjoy it any other way.
</p>

<p>
	Why do you need another being to reflect back to you the beauty of life? Don't you see that this step is extraneous? If life is good then you shouldn't need anyone else to corroborate that for you.
</p>

<p>
	If every human in the world died tomorrow and you were left all alone, life would still be as beautiful as ever. In fact, maybe more so <img alt=":D" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/biggrin@2x.png 2x" title=":D" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	So just bite the bullet and you will see solipsism is nothing bad.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	The problem with Psymposia is that they are getting trapped in the Stage Green SJW groupthink. They are a little too eager for social justice, which ends up leading to it's own kind of injustice and distorted perception of reality.

	I am talking about an existential dilemma which goes way beyond veganism or petty human concerns.

	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Yes. But not according to my logic. According to God's logic because in fact slavery exists.
</p>

<p>
	Is owning pets slavery? It owning pets wrong? If you say yes, imagine all the pets who would have never existed if you abolish pet ownership. Do you think that's a net win for the pets?
</p>

<p>
	What I'm saying is, from God's POV it is better to suffer than not live at all. Otherwise God would never have created suffering.
</p>

<p>
	Again, I am not trying to argue against veganism here. I think veganism is good. I am trying to point you guys to contemplate a deeper existential issue of life and suffering, so you have a deeper appreciation of the complex tradeoffs involved.
</p>

<p>
	This is not some rationalization for mistreating animals.

<p>
	It's not so obvious that to not exist is better. Who are you to make this call on behalf of animals?
</p>

<p>
	Obviously since these animals exist, the Universe's intelligence decided it is better that they exist than not.
</p>

<p>
	I am not saying factory farming isn't a problem. I am simply pointing out that this issue of life vs suffering is not nearly as simple as you guys think. In fact, I'm willing to bet you never seriously thought about it how counter-intuitive it is.

<p>
	Here's a real mindfuck for ya, if you want some serious food for thought:
</p>

<p>
	Is it better to be born a farm animal, or never be born at all?
</p>

<p>
	In a sense, to end all animal farming is like killing a trillion animals forever.

<p>
	Certainly people can be born with brain disorders or simply genetic mutations and anomalies.
</p>

<p>
	But even so, none of them are evil.
</p>

<p>
	Snakes can be born with 2 heads. So it's not so surprising that some humans are born with abnormal brains.

	Sorry to say but it seems he's just not that into you and maybe looking for an upgrade.
</p>

<p>
	This early into a relationship he should be really into you. He probably just doesn't want to hurt your feelings by telling you you're not the one for him.

<p>
	Game can be directed towards various goals. The goal does not define game. You could do game to find a wife. In fact, many guys are interested in that.
</p>

<p>
	Game is simply learning how to attract women. How you use this skill is up to you. You could use it to become a rapist, or you could use it to start a family.
</p>

<p>
	Practically, to find a good life-long partner requires burning through lots of dates to find the right one. Your first handful of relationships are going to be awful.

<p>
	You have to understand that such health conditions usually have dozens of possible causes, not one. So you need to troubleshoot them all until you find yours. Do not assume there is one universal cause or solution.

<p>
	Just because you become more conscious does not mean what you're attracted to changes. The idea that conscious girls are above game is silly. A girl is a girl and they are all fundamentally attracted to the same basic things. As are guys.

	No, she was very interested. Just the usual games and BS. It was not even close to rape.

<p>
	I will provide a simple intro and outro clip that will be the same for all clips.
</p>

<p>
	So basically just clipping my old videos is the job. And titling them.
</p>

<p>
	The trickiest part of this job is simply selecting which portions of a 2hr video are worth clipping. If you can do that, the rest is really easy.
</p>

<p>
	Writing juicy titles also takes some skill, but it can learned.

Do you think that dairy is a big cause of acne in people? I have a lot more acne than other people my age and I ingest a lot of dairy. I also heard in your video on buying healthy food that you had a lot acne too when you ate/drank dairy. So, is dairy a big cause of acne?
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	For me dairy does not cause acne, but certain food additives do. I only get acne if I eat out at fast food and other such restaurants. I never get acne if I cook my own food.
</p>

<p>
	But you may be different. If you do a strict elimination diet and cook all your own food you can quickly discover what is the cause of your acne. Acne occurs about 3-6hrs after eating something your body reacts too.
</p>

</p>

<p>
	Also, diet is not the only factor. It might be heavy metal toxicity, or the water you drink, or the shampoo you use, or the plastics you consume. So you have to eliminate all those factors as well.
</p>

<p>
	And even then, you might have developed leaky gut, or SIBO, or something else which requires further action to heal.
</p>

<p>
	But yeah, eliminating gluten and dairy and junk food should probably be your first move. But that's just the beginning.
</p>

<title>Hiring Part-Time Video Editor</title>

<p>
	I'm creating a second Actualized Clips channel which will feature short segments of my long videos. Similar to Joe Rogan's Clips channel.
</p>

<p>
	I'm looking for someone with video editing experience <u>and</u> good sense who can chop up my long videos into elegant 2-8 minutes clips. You gotta understand which juicy parts to clip and which parts not. You also need to be good at coming up with sexy titles for the clips. Not click-bait, but titles that are appealing and generate clicks.
</p>

<p>
	This would be a long-term, part-time job, maybe 7-10 hours per week. We can discuss what is fair payment, I'm not sure yet. You would work remotely and manage your own time. I would manage you very little, mostly just giving you feedback on the quality of your clipping and titling.
</p>

<p>
	My videos are very large at 30-70GB/video. You need to have a good enough internet connection to download many of them per month, and you will also need to upload GB-sized clip files. You will upload finished clips to my server. Also, you must have access to a Windows PC which can handle and render large video files. A dinky laptop is not gonna cut it.
</p>

<p>
	Keep in mind this is not a full-time job so don't expect this to pay all your bills. Think of this as a gig you do on the side for some extra cash. If you are good at this work it would potentially be a very long-term job. I basically have 100s of old videos that need clipping, plus each new weekly video as long as I keep releasing content.
</p>

<p>
	PM me if you're interested in the work. Include a brief explanation of your relevant experience and why you think you'd be good at this job. Also tell me your age and the city you live in.
</p>

<p>
	Thanks!
</p>

	Her game is playing coy and pretending sex is special.
</p>

<p>
	A girl's game is very sneaky. It's the game of pretending she isn't playing a game. She's so good at it that she perceives it as reality itself.

I mean no matter how busy you are dealing with survival, you can have 30 minutes each day to meditate for example and read some books. Yes you will not become enlightened but doing these things for years will make you more developed than most people out there. The PUA community actually supports meditation and reading books.

<p>
	Of course you can meditate a bit every day. But in practice you will not break through from such pathetically weak practices.
</p>

<p>
	If you are serious about breaking through via meditation, you need to schedule some 10 day retreats at least, and meditate all day long like a motherfucker.
</p>

<p>
	The PUA community don't know shit about awakening or how to achieve it. Nor do they care. If you follow them you will never awaken. On the other hand, they can get you laid <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />

<p>
	There is definitely a trade-off between sex and awakening. Choose your priorities wisely.

			God can't partially be God and partially be some other thing. "God has to actually BECOME those things" fully and entirely for what it is– its form, its limitation– in order to <strong>TRULY</strong> understand what it's like to be that one thing. God has to surrender its identity entirely (i.e. selfless) to understand what it's like to be something.
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	Exactly. To be everything one must be nothing. Only nothing is flexible enough to become everything. Like a blank sheet of paper can take any drawings, but a drawn sheet of paper cannot take other drawings. There is an absolute trade-off between drawing one scene vs another scene. You cannot draw a scene of Egypt while also drawing a scene of Japan. Drawing any finite thing precludes the possibility of drawing another finite thing. All form is finite in this way. The only way to escape this limitation is to surrender existence as a form of any kind. Which, God, in its infinite wisdom has done. God surrendered all form to -- paradoxically -- create all possible forms. The only way for God to create everything was to itself be nothing. Which is why God is so hard to find. God is hard to find because it cannot exist as a form -- and since humans are forms, they only care about and look for forms. So humans look around, they don't see God's form, and they conclude that God must not exist. But what they don't realize is that God doesn't have form by design. It's not a bug, it's a feature!

<p>
	In practice, yes. The order of operations is: become skillful at survival, then transcend survival.

<p>
	For a few exceptionally gifted people this order of operations is not needed, but for most people it is. It is hard to be serious about spiritual work when you are horny and lonely and craving it.

			If I accept that this colours and sounds and feelings are happening to God/The Self and my persona/ego is just a construction built on top of the Absolute, then I am alone and this is a dream and I am just talking with imaginary people of my Consciousness.
		</p>

		<p>
			If being conscious of this and accepting it is Enlightment, then people who are enlightened would stop playing the dream altogether. And this is clearly not the case. Every teacher of non duality who according to this forum is enlightened, is still playing all kind of games. Teaching to imaginary people, building business which are imaginary, using cars which are imaginary, uploading videos to YouTube which in fact is also imaginary and is reaching nobody...etc.

			You were questioned by this in the past and you said "I keep playing games [...] because there Is no other thing to do ."

	Exactly.

<p>
	You assume there is a distimction between real and imaginary things. But there is not. Reality IS imagination. And this is not some bummer. This is the mosg wonderful thing. One day you will realize that you want to live in an imaginary world. It's so much more fun!

<p>
	Why the fuck do you want things to not be imaginary? Seriously!

	Causality exists within a relative, imaginary 2D plane of what materialists call reality. Similar to how causality exists in a video game world.

</p>

<p>
	You cannot apply the logic of people who don't have autoimmunity to those who do. It's a totally different ballgame. It's like giving someone who's allergic to peanuts more and more nuts.
</p>

<p>
	I'm not saying carnivore diet is good long-term. It's a specific tool for dealing with autoimmune conditions. Think of it as the ultimate elimination or elemental diet.

<p>
	Yes, well, if you could understand what I meant you would become enlightened right this second. Ego must prevent you from understanding it. Your life hinges on you not understanding.
</p>

<p>
	I mean that colors and sounds and feelings are happening, but they are not happening to anyone, they are not happening to a human "you". As odd as this sounds, the colors and sounds and feelings that are happening right now are NOT happening to you. They are happening without you. But they are happening. I am not denying colors and sounds and feelings. I am just denying that "you" they seem to happen to.
</p>

<p>
	This is explained in great detail in my video: What Is Perception?

Why are humans selective in their love? Why don't they love EVERYTHING equally? Because humans have a self they which to survive. This self is finite, therefore it cannot embrace/Love infinitely. A finite self must have a bias to love some things over other things, because some thing might kill it or harm it.
</p>

<p>
	But God has no self! Since God has no self, it has nothing to defend and nothing to lose. Therefore it can Love absolutely EVERYTHING, because why not? Why not love EVERYTHING? Only if you have a self that is biased. But God is Infinitely Conscious, therefore it cannot sustain the illusion of a finite self, and therefore it simply is LOVE as a pure Absolute.
</p>

<p>
	Think of it this way: why would reality as whole not love itself completely? I mean... reality as a whole cannot be harmed by anything because it is everything already, and it cannot be any better than it is because "being better" is a notion only the ego cares about.
</p>

<p>
	Notice this: if you didn't care about getting a survival advantage in life you would not care about one thing more than any other. And if you didn't care about one thing more than any other, you would care about all things equally. But if you care about all things equally, see the beauty of everything, which grow infinite. And so you would fall absolutely in love with EVERYTHING because you don't need it to be different than it is.
</p>

<p>
	The only thing that keeps you from falling in love with absolutely EVERYTHING is the ego wanting things to be different.

	You could probably grow them in a tiny storage unit for $30/mo if it's legal in your area I don't see the problem.

<p>

</p>

<p>
	Just be careful that you are not caught and tried as a dealer. Usually if they catch you making drugs, they will try you as a dealer even if it was just for your personal use. They will just assume you will be selling them and that will stick in court. You do not want to get caught as a dealer or drug lab.

	Move out and find yourself a solitary place where you can feel right.

<p>
	You shouldn't have to abide fools and devils cavorting in your living space.
</p>

<p>
	Yes, it's annoying to move, but you'll be glad you did. Consider it part of your personal development process. An important part of personal development is setting up your own personal sanctuary at home where no assholes can interrupt you. Don't treat this as unimportant. Your home is important.

	It's more strange-loopy than that.
</p>

<p>
	The brain is not a reducing valve of consciousness, consciousness imagined a reducing valve and called it "a brain".
</p>

<p>
	The paradox is that the brain reduces consciousness not by some material mechanism, but simply you imagining you have one. When you buy the idea that "I have a brain and it produces my consciousness" -- that idea itself reduces your consciousness and THAT is true function of "the brain". The concept of "the brain" is there to ground you in finite consciousness, for without that concept everything would be seen to be as it truly is: infinite <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	Imagine if you were locked in a prison with an open lock, and the only thing keeping you locked in there was your idea that the door was locked! For decades you planned how to break through the lock, and none of your methods worked, until one day you realized there was no lock, and suddenly the door opened.
</p>

<p>
	You ARE the lock and you ARE the key!

<p>
	I never said anything about a rock having a POV. "Having a POV" IS the self! The problem here is not the rock's POV (which you imagine) but that you believe that YOU have a POV! That is the ego illusion. You don't really have a POV, there is Absolute Being, not a POV. Ego imagines the notion of POVs because it needs to feel like it has one. The entire notion of having a POV is wrong.

<p>
	That's a even deeper mindfuck to be had here: Notice that for a chameleon to truly be infinite, it would not only need to be colorless but also formless, thus allowing it to become any other thing. Imagine a chameleon who is such a good chameleon that he had to surrender even his chameleon identity because he needed to in order to mimic a rock, or a bird, or a human. But in this case, if the chameleon really became so strong and good at his function, he would no longer be merely "mimicking" those objects, he would literally BE those objects.
</p>

<p>
	So a true Chameleon cannot even be a chameleon. He must be a non-chameleon Chameleon <img alt=";)" data-emoticon="" height="20" src="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink.png" srcset="https://www.actualized.org/forum/uploads/emoticons/wink@2x.png 2x" title=";)" width="20" />
</p>

<p>
	And if you understand that, then you understand why God must have no identity: precisely so he would take every identity fully, without mimickery. See? God can't just pretend to be rock or a bird or a human, God has to actually BECOME those things, otherwise how would they come into existence?

			Question though—does Love address the “why” component of God’s fragmentation? Aka why does God fragment itself into finite perspectives. Like, God delights in realizing itself as infinity by first limiting itself. Or is it more just the fact that limitation is intrinsic to infinity, so it could be no other way?
		</p>

		<p>
			Hopefully that makes sense
		</p>
	</div>
</blockquote>

<p>
	The why is more radical than you think.
</p>

<p>
	God IS Love. Love is Truth. Love is Absolute. Therefore literally nothing but LOVE can ever exist. So if a thing exists, it's ultimate cause is always simply LOVE. Reality is LOVE, and LOVE is EVERYTHING, and God is EVERYTHING. Therefore all the finite stuff is just literally what God is. The end.

			When you take a drug, like an anesthetic or a psychedelic, there obviously seems to be a predictable change in subjective experience and behavior. Surely, without going into details, this as well must count as a demonstration of causality, must it not?

<p>
	If Sherlock Holmes ate some mushrooms or hit himself in the head with a hammer, he would experience some odd subjective experiences. And he would consider it a demonstration of causality.
</p>

<p>
	But is it really? All of that "causality" is occurring within an imaginary dimension. The true cause of Sherlock Holmes' odd subjective experiences is not the mushroom or the hammer or his brain, it's the author who imagined him and his entire universe -- of which Sherlock is totally clueless because the author exists outside the plane of his reality.

	Causality is imaginary, as is time and history.

<p>
	Peter Ralston in particular has made some incredible contributions to mankind's understanding of itself, but virtually nobody recognizes it. He really deserves to be as well-known as Einstein. But, alas, that will never be the case.
</p>

<p>
	Being well-known is largely a marketing game. It has little to do with the depth of one's work.

<p>
	You should chase living an authentic life aligned with your top values, your top passions, helping spread truth, consciousness, love, and beauty across the Universe via which ever way most excites you and suits your unique strengths and talents.
</p>

<p>
	You are right that you should not just sit around twiddling your thumbs. You should be constantly working on your life purpose and evolving yourself towards that end.
</p>

<p>
	Life is short. Don't squander it sitting around in confusion and inaction.
</p>

<p>
	False success is chasing what others tell you is good.
</p>

<p>
	True success is devoting your life to expressing the Love that you have for the world in your unique way, and doing so skillfully and eagerly.
</p>

<p>
	False success will not make you happy, but true success will.

There should be a way to fix it. Try to find people who had it and lost it, and ask them what things they tried.

	Maybe changing your diet, maybe some detox protocols, maybe some psychedelics.... keep trying stuff with the hope that something will help.

<p>
	Think of it like this: a TV screen has no persona until it displays some persona played by an actor in a movie. It would be silly to suggest that the TV has the person it is displaying, or some other persona, because the TV can display infinite personas. The only way the TV can display infinite personas is precisely because its "true persona" is null.
</p>

<p>
	That's how God is. God cannot have a self because God imagines all possible selves and non-selves alike.
</p>

<p>
	A chameleon who can change all of his colors has no color. He is -- paradoxically -- colorless. A colorless chameleon is an infinite chameleon. Colorless = Infinite Colors. No-self = Infinite Self.
